an elderly husband and wife have announced their plans to die in the world 's first ' couple ' euthanasia - despite neither of them being terminally ill. instead the pair fear loneliness if the other one dies first from natural causes			1
identified only by their first names , @entity15 , 89 , and @entity16 , 86 , they have the support of their three adult children who say they would be unable to care for either parent if they became widowed			1
@entity21 , 59 , whose death in an assisted suicide in a @entity26 clinic was broadcasted on television the children have even gone so far as to find a practitioner willing to carry out the double killings on the grounds that the couple 's mental anguish constituted the unbearable suffering needed to legally justify euthanasia			1
the couple , from @entity37 , are receiving regular medical treatment for age - related ailments			1
@entity15 has received treatment for prostate cancer for 20 years and is unable to spend a day without morphine and @entity16 is partially blind and almost totally deaf			1
they always go out shopping together because they are both scared that one day the other will not return home			2
they decided that life in a care home was not an option because of their fear they would end up bedridden without the strength to insist on euthanasia			1
they are also afraid that a good retirement home would cost more than their combined pensions and that they would have to dig into their savings to afford it			0
they planned to commit suicide on february 3 next year , their 64th wedding anniversary , by placing plastic bags over their heads after taking an overdose of sleeping pills			0
the couple decided that life in a care home was not an option because of their fear they would end up bedridden without the strength to insist on euthanasia ' we want to go together because we both fear of the future , ' said @entity15			1
' it 's as simple as this : we are afraid of what lies ahead			0
' fear of being alone and above all , fear of the consequences of loneliness			1
' he told @entity88 , a @entity90 online news service , that they eventually opted for euthanasia because they were too scared to attempt to commit suicide			1
' it takes courage to jump from the 20th floor and i am unable even if i wanted to do it , ' said @entity15			1
' it takes courage to hang , it takes courage to jump into the canal			0
but a doctor who makes you a shot and lets you gently fall asleep ? it does not take courage			0
' their son , @entity110 , 55 , approached their doctor to request their euthanasia - which was legalised in @entity90 in 2002 - but the doctor refused because there were no grounds for it			1
@entity110 found another doctor willing to perform the killings in an unnamed hospital in @entity122 , the @entity124 - speaking part of @entity90 in which 82 per cent of euthanasia cases are performed			2
@entity15 said he and @entity16 were grateful for the arrangement			1
' without our son and our daughter , it would never have succeeded , ' he said			0
' we are not sad , we are happy , ' he continued			0
' when we were told we could leave life together smoothly we were on a little cloud			0
it was as if we had spent all that time in a tunnel and suddenly we came into the light again			0
' the couple 's daughter has remarked that her parents are talking about their deaths as eagerly as if they were planning a holiday			1
@entity110 said the double euthanasia of his parents was the ' best solution '			2
' if one of them should die , who would remain would be so sad and totally dependent on us , ' he said			2
' it would be impossible for us to come here every day , take care of our father or our mother			0
' the double euthanasia will not be first in @entity90 , a country where an average of five people a day die by lethal injection			1
in 2012 deaf twins @entity158 and @entity160 , 45 , were granted their wish to die after they learned they would likely to become blind			2
mental anguish is also increasingly being used as a justification for the procedure with one of the most sensational cases involving transsexual @entity167 , 44 , killed by lethal injection after doctors botched her sex change operation			0
earlier this month @entity170 , a rapist and murderer , became the first prisoner to successfully argue for the right to die by euthanasia on the grounds that his mental anguish meant that he was suffering			1
nonetheless , the @entity90 couple 's plan for a double death has shocked opponents of assisted suicide and euthanasia in the @entity184 where @entity186 's @entity185 reaches committee stage in the @entity188 in november , @entity189 of @entity190 , who investigated euthanasia for a parliamentary inquiry , said : ' this is an example of a very dangerous use of euthanasia in entirely inappropriate circumstances			1
' what it demonstrates is that the most stringent safeguards would be needed if this was going to be legalised in the @entity184			0
' @entity201 , the actress who plays disabled forensics technician @entity202 in @entity204 's @entity203 , said the casual practice of euthanasia in @entity90 had developed from a law designed initially for hard cases			2
' once you allow a doctor to assist you to end your life when the patient defines when they are suffering i think you are opening the door to an extension of that law , ' she said			0
' it may be everyone 's intention that initially it will be only for a small group of people but how you monitor that and how you enforce that is practically impossible			0
' ' it is terrifying where this could go , ' she added			0
dr @entity228 of @entity229 yet @entity184 , a network of disabled people against euthanasia , said death in @entity90 was now regarded ' as lightly as stepping off a bus '			2
' the pro-euthanasia lobby says there is no extension from terminally ill candidates yet everywhere we turn in @entity90 non-terminally ill people are being euthanised			0
' @entity241 which is campaigning for a change in @entity184 law , has dismissed fears that @entity186 's @entity245 might lead to similar horrors			0
it insists that the @entity245 is based on a safer model of assisted suicide ' which has been working safely for over 17 years and has never been extended beyond the criteria of terminal illness ' .			2

@entity15 , 89 , and @entity16 , 86 are planning to die in first ' couple ' euthanasia
the pair from @entity37 fear loneliness if the other one dies first
they say they have the full support of their three adult children
@entity15 has received treatment for prostate cancer for the past 20 years
