@entity0 and @entity1 shared the spoils in their opening match in @entity4 , as all four teams in @entity6 go into the second round of games level on a single point			1
in a game lacking quality , @entity10 put the @entity13 ahead after 70 minutes , before @entity14 equalized from the penalty spot to secure @entity1 a deserved draw			1
the spot - kick was heavily disputed by the @entity18 , who claimed , with some justification , that @entity14 both went to ground very easily , and that any contact there came outside the area			1
the @entity0 team celebrate after @entity10 's goal put them 1 - 0 up in their first match on sunday @entity10 's goal looked as though it would put @entity0 top of @entity6 , but they could only manage a point @entity0 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity31 ; @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 ; @entity36 ( @entity37 82 ) , @entity38 ( ragued 87 ) , @entity39 , @entity40 ( @entity41 82 ) ; @entity42 , @entity10 goal : @entity10 70 booked : @entity44 15 @entity1 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity45 ; @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity50 75 ) ; @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 ; @entity14 , @entity54 ( @entity55 68 ) , @entity56 ( @entity57 84 ) goal : @entity14 77 referee : @entity61 - @entity60 it was perhaps fitting that the first match of this competition to fall below a high standard of play should have seen the result settled by the competition 's first seriously controversial decision			1
matters were not helped by the pitch , laid shortly before the tournament began and obviously not up to the rigours of back - to - back matches			0
at one point , when @entity10 slid to get onto the end of a cross he brought up a divot more than a foot long			0
@entity0 , favourites to top the group before play started , did little to justify the tag , save for a short spell midway through the second half in which they hit the bar , and scored the goal			1
but , @entity1 had by far the better chances , particularly in what was a decidedly lacklustre first half			2
@entity0 midfielder @entity92 ( right ) challenges @entity1 's @entity53 during the @entity6 match @entity53 ( left ) is stopped in his tracks by @entity0 's @entity33 during the match in @entity4 in just the second minute @entity47 thundered a header against the post , with @entity31 in the @entity0 goal well beaten			1
for the first time in the tournament both the intensity of the football , and the atmosphere , was lacking			0
the @entity105 ’ front three attempted to inject some life into it			0
@entity14 and @entity56 , two wingers based in @entity109 , in particular posed a threat with their pace and trickery			2
@entity56 was the first to test @entity31 in the 18th minute , stinging the palms of the @entity0 keeper at the near post , moments after a jinking run that roused the sleepy crowd			1
on the half hour mark the lively @entity14 , who plays his club football at @entity120 , got free down the right , avoiding a dangerously high foot from @entity33 , but when he picked out @entity54 the striker could only fire low at @entity125			2
soon after @entity1 keeper @entity45 had to be alert to dive at the feet of @entity128 , but the @entity13 carried little in the way of goal threat			1
@entity131 ( left ) is sent flying as @entity1 scorer @entity14 comes away with the ball on sunday @entity0 's @entity134 ( right ) leaps with @entity1 's @entity135 during their @entity6 opener @entity137 , the smallest country in @entity140 history , continued to come forward , @entity51 playing a lovely pass for @entity54 down the right hand channel five minutes later , but the striker could n’t seem to make up his mind between crossing for a well - placed @entity14 , or going for goal			1
in this end , his attempt floated close to the far post , over @entity31 , but just beyond the target			0
then , seven minutes before half time , @entity0 survived a moment of controversy , when @entity131 avoided giving away a penalty , or receiving a red card , when he brought down @entity14 , who was bursting through on goal			1
@entity53 picked out his forward with a lovely pass , and when the @entity120 man was brought down on the edge of the box , @entity155 referee @entity60 correctly awarded a free kick , despite claims it was inside the penalty area			0
however , the full back was fortunate not to be shown a card , given the run @entity14 was making towards goal			2
from the resultant free - kick @entity51 smashed a shot into the wall , sparking a goalmouth scramble from which @entity56 poked wide			0
the @entity13 team , favourites to top @entity6 , line up ahead of their opening @entity176 match @entity1 , who are the smallest country in @entity176 history , line up ahead of the game @entity56 had the second half ’s first good chance , almost capping off a flowing break from @entity1 , but having beaten @entity183 he saw @entity184 clear off the line			1
@entity0 finally began to threaten soon after the hour mark			2
@entity187 beat @entity45 to a free kick only to see his header rattled the woodwork			0
the ball was bundled in from the rebound , but by that time the referee had spotted a foul			0
seven minutes later they had the ball in the net again , this time legally			0
full back @entity198 got forward down the left and slid an inviting ball across goal , which @entity10 converted at the far post , firing into the roof of the net			0
the celebrations were shortlived however , and despite the controversial nature of the penalty , it was no less than @entity1 deserved .			0

earlier in the day , @entity211 drew 1 - 1 with @entity212 in @entity6
@entity128 fired into the top corner to put @entity0 ahead
@entity14 levelled the scores in the 77th minute for @entity1
a 1 - 1 draw means all four @entity6 teams are level after the first *fixtures*
