it was just after breakfast , only a few short hours after the rampant champagne - fuelled celebrations into the early morning had ended , but @entity4 knew exactly what he was saying			1
still in @entity9 ’s five - star @entity7 hotel , the ‘ fat boy with the bowl full of @entity14 ’ ( his own words , not mine ) told an @entity11 journalist friend : ‘ yes we ’ve made history by winning @entity18 — but this is @entity9			1
lose two games next season and i ’ll still be an “ idiot ”			0
’ date : may 25 , 2014			0
hotel address : @entity23 , @entity24			0
and of course @entity4 was speaking after @entity9 ’s two principal teams , sworn enemies , had contested the @entity28 and he had lifted the ‘ cup with the big ears ’ for the fifth time as player or coach			1
@entity4 is starting to feel the strain after recent poor results at @entity9 @entity4 was a hero after guiding @entity9 to their 10th @entity37 triumph last year @entity38 celebrates after scoring @entity9 's second goal in extra time during the @entity24 final @entity42 scored his team 's fourth late in extra time to secure the famous victory august 19 - real 1 - 1 @entity46 @entity47 , @entity48 august 22 - @entity46 1 - 0 @entity9 @entity47 , @entity49 september 13 - real 1 - 2 @entity46 @entity50 january 7 - @entity46 2 - 0 @entity9 @entity51 last 16 , @entity48 january 15 - real 2 - 2 @entity46 @entity51 last 16 , @entity49 february 7 - @entity46 4 - 0 @entity9 @entity50 not that winning liberated him from the sad truth of his statement			1
two games ? his team have lost almost one out of every three matches in 2015 ( six defeats in 19 outings )			0
worse is the fact that he is now a black smudge on @entity9 ’s pristine - white history , having already lost to @entity46 — the club which was unable to register a single win over @entity9 between 1999 and 2013 — four times in a season			1
perhaps worst of all , the @entity72 champions ’ utterly humiliating 4 - 0 defeat at the ferocious @entity75 stadium last time these two met , just over two months ago , meant @entity46 had won all three home ‘ derbis ’ by a 7 - 0 aggregate this term			1
in fact , during each of the seven defeats in 11 derbies @entity4 has had to soak up as @entity9 manager against @entity86 ’s bruising buccaneers , his team has n’t scored once			1
none of which make @entity4 an idiot			1
where they do , cumulatively , leave him is in perhaps the most embarrassing position of his career			0
not because if he loses the imminent @entity28 quarter - final against @entity97 ’s champions @entity4 fears the sack			1
@entity42 sits dejected during @entity9 's 4 - 0 @entity50 defeat to @entity46 back in february @entity100 ( left ) celebrates with @entity101 after scoring in @entity46 's 4 - 0 win in february like @entity104 in @entity105 , there are some penalties in his chosen profession which ‘ @entity4 ’ ( @entity109 ) treats as an occupational hazard			1
you might argue that losing a 3 - 0 lead over @entity112 in @entity113 almost exactly a decade ago should constitute that moment of maximum embarrassment			0
@entity4 not only famously doled out revenge on @entity118 ’s team two years later — when @entity119 reached the 2007 final they watched the @entity112 v @entity122 second semi-final together , cheering and roaring for the @entity123 more hoarsely than any @entity124 to go through so that history could be re-visited — he could also come to terms with the remarkable 3 - 3 - and - penalties defeat			2
his view : ‘ my team did its very best to win			0
so i could n’t be angry			0
i think this was destiny			0
i ’ve managed nearly 900 matches in my career and two where my team played exceptionally well were that @entity113 final and the semi against @entity129 in 2007			0
’ so this is a different red - and - white thorn in his side			0
constant defeats during which @entity9 have not , by any stretch , done their best			2
things have , in fact , been getting incrementally worse			0
may ’s final in @entity24 was won the very second that @entity143 made it 1 - 1 in the 93rd minute			0
@entity46 were , almost literally , out on their feet			2
a rueful @entity4 walks past the @entity37 after @entity119 surrendered a three - goal lead against @entity112 but @entity4 made up for it by beating @entity112 in 2007 and gaining revenge for that defeat two years before @entity119 @entity37 2002 - 03 , 2006 - 07 @entity149 2003 , 2007 @entity150 2007 @entity151 2003 - 04 @entity152 2002 - 03 @entity153 2004 @entity122 @entity154 2009 - 10 @entity155 2009 - 10 @entity156 2009 @entity157 @entity158 1 2012 - 13 @entity9 @entity37 2013 - 14 @entity149 2014 @entity150 2014 @entity51 2013 - 14 since then , it has been as if @entity159 have soaked up all the anger , all the humiliation , all the impotent rage they felt when @entity42 venerated his penalty goal ( to kill an already dead match ) for 4 - 1 with his ‘ i ’m actually the @entity166 ’ celebration			1
in the drama of that night , and amidst the history of @entity9 ’s tenth title , it 's often forgotten that when @entity170 kicked the ball at @entity46 ’s @entity173 manager with two minutes left in extra-time , @entity86 chased him onto the pitch then had to be both restrained and persuaded to leave the playing surface before being sent off			1
@entity86 , applauded out of the press conference later that night in appreciation of having won the @entity97 title and of how heroically @entity46 clung on to @entity181 ’s headed lead in @entity24 , spoke kindly about @entity170 being ‘ just a kid ’ with ‘ a great future ’ in the post-match post-mortem			2
but , trust me , that was one of the spurs chafing at @entity86 ’s skin all summer until the @entity47 second leg when @entity170 was pressed , exposed for awareness and sharpness and @entity100 bagged the goal which started @entity46 ’s winning run against @entity9 this season			1
‘ the most important , most intelligent player in every great team is usually a midfielder , ’ @entity4 believes			2
@entity46 manager @entity86 rushes on to confront @entity9 defender @entity170 in the final @entity86 also had a go at referee @entity198 as tempers boiled over during the last few minutes @entity46 were unable to hang on to the lead given to them by @entity181 during the @entity24 final he was one such , as was @entity86 , plus @entity202 , @entity203 ( and @entity204 at a far lower level ) at four of the other eight @entity28 quarter - finalists			1
however , as a coach , @entity4 could n’t be more different from the breed represented by @entity86 , ‘ @entity209 ’ and @entity203			2
and that ’s something else , other than @entity4 ’s future employment with @entity9 , which is at stake this week			1
from the moment when elite footballers , and then run - of - the - mill players , began to earn money per season which made them absolutely financially secure for life , the worth of the coach who is only authoritarian was at an end			1
if you ca n’t ‘ convince ’ and ‘ enlist ’ your multi-millionaire squad at a club which is expected to win one , or more , of the great trophies each season , then you are dead in the water			2
but @entity203 , @entity229 and @entity86 come from a school where they not only master the teaching , coaxing , convincing , but show ferocious authoritarian tendencies , too			0
‘ my way or the high way ’ is something they not only dare to say to a player worth £ 50m - plus , they believe it ’s their right			0
@entity4 is built differently , having won 17 trophies as a coach seeking only intelligence , diligence and intensity of effort			2
he neither wants nor needs to instil fear , to make his players blind followers of a regimental doctrine — he actually treats them as responsible grown - ups			0
if his team act like novice kids at the @entity75 on tuesday , once again , then @entity4 still wo n’t be an idiot			2
but an endangered species — yes .			0

@entity9 have not beaten their *neighbours* in six meetings this season
they will meet again in @entity28 last eight this week
@entity4 is under *increasing* pressure after poor form in 2015
he *masterminded* @entity9 's 10th @entity37 triumph last season
but that win over @entity46 has *n't* made his job any more secure
