devastated by the worst nuclear disaster in history , @entity0 is now a barren ghost town slowly being forgotten			1
these astonishing aerial photographs of the former power plant and the neighbouring city of @entity6 show how they are becoming hidden from view as the surrounding forest closes in			1
following the disaster - which occurred during a systems test on april 26 , 1986 - the @entity10 government evacuated 350,000 residents from @entity0 and @entity6			1
its 50,000 residents were evacuated a few days after the 1986 disaster open : this file picture taken in the ' 90s shows how @entity6 looked before the forest completely closed in around it bare : this 1986 picture shows prypiat following the mass evacuation			1
it housed 47,000 inhabitants , including 17,000 children before the disaster eerie : the city of @entity6 , top right , and the @entity0 power plant , centre , are surrounded by the forest an exclusion zone covering an area of more than 1,000sq miles around the abandoned plant was created to protect people from the effects of any lingering radiation			1
these pictures of the zone - taken from a height of 10,000 metres , show how after 27 years of remaining largely uninhabitable , the surrounding @entity46 is slowly reclaiming the plant and the city			1
@entity6 was founded in 1970 for the @entity49 and grew to a population of 49,360 before it was evacuated a few days after the disaster			2
the pictures , as reported by @entity53 , show its residential buildings spurting out from the thick woodland below			2
the secret @entity56 can also be seen among the dense woodland			0
the radar system could detect launches of a potential enemy in @entity61			0
but despite its hi - tech capabilities , it is now left to ruin			0
forgotten : the @entity0 power plant is now a scar on the otherwise large swathe of woodland different : this file picture of @entity0 nuclear power plant shows just how much it has changed since the disaster , with the forest now completely enveloping it hidden : following the disaster in 1986 , a @entity75 was set up around the site which has now been swamped by the @entity46 surrounded : this image shows ' @entity0 - 2 ' which at the time of the disaster was completely secret			1
it was a radar system which could detect launches of a potential enemy in @entity61 the accident on april 26,1986 , created a huge explosion and fire which released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere , spreading over western @entity90 and @entity91			0
although tens of thousands of people evacuated the area , a few residents refused to leave			2
a handful of older residents moved back to be close to family graves			2
tourists may obtain day passes , and some workers who are rebuilding parts of the site are allowed in for limited hours only each month			0
scientists say the area will not be safe to live in for another 20,000 years			0
efforts to contain the contamination and prevent a greater catastrophe involved more than 500,000 workers and cost 18 billion rubles			0
the official casualty count of 31 deaths has been disputed and there have also been numerous long - term effects such as cancers and deformities			0
dangerous : scientists say the area will not be safe to live in for another 20,000 years @entity117 : this shows the photographer 's view as the plane flies over the @entity10 tough job : a worker patrols @entity6 on sunday as dismantling work continues at the scene of the world 's worst nuclear accident important : workers need to constantly help protect against any possible future radiation leaks			1
