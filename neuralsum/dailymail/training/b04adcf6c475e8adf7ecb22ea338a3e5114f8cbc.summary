mr @entity36 said : ‘ the government is determined to build a fairer system and to address the public 's concern about immigration			0
‘ the proposals , set out in a consultation today , form part of the @entity71 which will be introduced later this year to ‘ tighten immigration law , strengthen our enforcement powers and clamp down on those from overseas who try to abuse our public services ’ , mr @entity36 added			1
controversially landlords will not have to contact the @entity28 if they suspect someone is in the @entity15 illegally , but can do so voluntarily if they want to			1
when the idea was floated in the @entity81 , @entity79 ’s housing spokesman @entity78 said : ‘ tackling illegal immigration must not take us back to the days when my @entity85 father was turned away from boarding houses displaying “ no dogs , no @entity85 ” signs			2
’ but the guidance published today states : ‘ landlords must make checks on a non-discriminatory basis , i.e. they should not make any assumptions about a person ’s migration status based on their ethnicity , name , accent , etc. ’ warning : immigration minister @entity36 said the government was determined to ' clamp down on those from overseas who try to abuse our public services ' the @entity79 today dismissed plans to stop foreigners ripping off the @entity105 as ' xenophobic '			1
@entity108 health minister @entity107 claimed limiting access to free healthcare to permanent @entity15 residents risked ' stigmatising foreigners ' and threatened public health			2
controversial new proposals include a new ‘ healthcare levy ’ for anyone coming to the @entity15 for more than six months , a charge to see family doctors for anyone here for less than six months , and a system to track migrant workers ’ use of the @entity105			2
last night the plan was backed by @entity125 , a @entity79 shadow health minister			0
but today her colleague ms @entity107 wrote on @entity127 : ' what price xenophobia ? stigmatising foreigners accessing @entity105 creates a public health risk			0
' @entity132 chairman @entity131 said : ' our nhs should be a national health service , not an international health service			0
' the rules will not apply to social housing rented to tenants nominated by local councils			0
homeless hostels , university halls of residences , boarding schools and children ’s homes will also be exempt			0
the checks landlords will have to make are the same as those employers have to make before hiring staff , but there are fears it will create increased paperwork for part - time landlords			1
would - be tenants will have to produce evidence from a checklist of documents that they have permission to be in the @entity15 , and landlords will have to take a copy for their records			1
valid documents include a @entity15 passport , or a combination of birth certificate , national insurance number and driving licence , naturalisation certificate or right of abode certificate			0
landlords will have to check the papers of all adults who will be living in the property			0

‘ this @entity216 is the next step in the radical reform of the immigration system which has led to a reduction in net migration - now at its lowest level for a decade			2
’ however the @entity222 also voiced concern			0
' if this is to work , it is vital that the system is simple , straightforward and easy for landlords to use and understand , ' a spokesman said			0
' it makes sense to base the requirements on the established system used by employers to verify that individuals have the right to work in the @entity15 , not least because there is a clear acknowledgement that employers , like landlords , are not immigration experts			1
' they can only be expected to carry out reasonable checks that someone is who they say they are , and that they have the documentation to prove they have the right to be here			0
