overnight service : @entity6 's pledge to see out its contract has caused controversy among rail unions but rail unions have attacked the decision to take the sleeper out of @entity2 hands and give it to an @entity7 company with @entity28 trains and ' a truly shocking track record in the delivery of public services '			1
@entity2 transport minister @entity32 said ministers ' had no choice ' , and insisted the appointment will herald ' a new beginning ' for the service			0

planned upgrades : an artist 's impression of the pod flatbed on the new fleet of the trains ' he has taken the contract away from an @entity100 - based @entity2 firm and handed it to an @entity7 - based firm which will be given a £ 60 million subsidy to build new trains in @entity28			1
