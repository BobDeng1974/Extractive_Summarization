by @entity0 published : 06:36 est , 16 april 2013 updated : 08:35 est , 16 april 2013 the laboratory which created @entity2 the sheep has produced a disease - resistant piglet the laboratory which created @entity2 the sheep has produced a disease - resistant piglet using a new technique which is simpler than cloning			1
it is believed the development could bring @entity12 meat a step closer			1
the piglet , known only as ' @entity15 ' , was created through a process called ' gene editing ' at @entity19 's @entity18 four months ago			1
it was engineered to have a gene making it immune to @entity23 swine fever which can kill @entity25 pigs within 24 hours of infection			1
the technique is faster and more efficient than existing methods , and also does not involve the use of antibiotic - resistance genes			1
one of the main arguments against the use of @entity12 is based on the use of the genes which campaigners fear could lead to crucial drugs becoming ineffective			2
scientists looking for ways to feed the ever growing population hope it could make genetic engineering of livestock more publicly acceptable , the @entity37 reports			0
the process works by snipping an animal 's dna and inserting new genetic material			2
researchers say it copies a natural genetic mutation and would therefore by impossible to tell by looking at an animal 's @entity44 whether it had been modified			0
it has a success rate of ten to 15 per cent compared to less than one per cent for the existing methods used by scientists			1
it can also be carried out on a fertilised egg without the need for cloning techniques			0
prof @entity60 told the paper : ' we can get rid of antibiotic resistance and for some situations we can get rid of cloning as well			0
i think cloning does have some baggage attached to it			0
' the gene was taken from wild @entity23 pigs			0
the creatures are naturally immune to the @entity23 fever virus but can not breed with @entity25 species			2
the piglet , known only as ' @entity15 ' , was created through a process called ' gene editing ' at @entity19 's @entity18 where @entity2 the sheep was created 17 years ago it is now hoped other livestock , such as cattle and sheep immune to a host of diseases , could become immune to a host of other diseases with the technique			1
the first genetically modified meat and fish could be approved this summer			0
authorities in the @entity89 are expected to grant approval to @entity92 salmon , which has been modified to grow twice as fast as normal salmon			0
and experts trying to combat world hunger are calling on the @entity96 to back the use of @entity12 farm animals on the dinner table here			2
the push into @entity12 meat could see the production of giant pigs , hens that have only female chicks and cattle made disease resistant using genes from baboons			1
but the move will alarm critics of the use of gm technology who are still battling to block the expansion of genetically modified crops prof @entity60 said the technique was garnering interest from commercial companies and international regulators are now considering how to classify it			0

@entity145 scientists yesterday called on the government to support the spread of @entity12 into farm animals but admit there will need to be a change in attitude among @entity153 families and retailers .			1

' @entity15 ' was created through a process called ' gene editing '
technique faster and more efficient than existing methods
it is immune to *african* swine fever which can kill within 24 hours
