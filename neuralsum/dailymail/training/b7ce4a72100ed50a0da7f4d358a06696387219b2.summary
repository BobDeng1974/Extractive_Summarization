@entity6 , 32 paid just £ 50 for the pile of natural stones , but the carving could fetch as much as £ 10,000 ( $ 15,680 ) at auction			1
the front panel is carved with the @entity15 cross , while a bird is carved along the top ( inset ) mr @entity6 had the 21 - inch long and 15 - inch wide piece examined by an expert at @entity33 ’s auctioneers in @entity34			1
it is believed to have once formed part of a cross-slab from an early @entity39 monument , and it is possible it was smashed by @entity42 invaders as an act of defiance against the @entity39 population of @entity47 in the ninth century			1
alternatively , it may have been a grave marker , or part of a decoration around an internal doorway or window			1
the expert also suggested the carving of the bird may be older than the carving of the cross			1
mr @entity6 said : ‘ i was doing a bit of work in my own garden and saw an advert for some natural stone			2
i phoned the people up and went to collect it			0
‘ the stones were covered in mud and moss , and when i got home i saw what i thought was the tail of the dragon on one of them			0
the stone was discovered by mr @entity6 in a pile of natural rocks he bought in @entity7 ( marked )			2
it is believed to have once formed part of a cross-slab from an early @entity39 monument , and it is possible it was smashed by @entity42 invaders as an act of defiance against the @entity39 population of @entity47 in the 9th century ‘ i cleaned it off and realised it was carved so i contacted a museum and the archaeologists got very excited			1
‘ no one could really say exactly what it was but they knew it was important			0
’ @entity33 ’s is auctioning off the find tomorrow , with a pre-sale estimate of £ 10,000 ( $ 15,680 ) and mr @entity6 said he hopes to pay off some of his mortgage with the money it makes			1
experts claim the bird ( pictured ) carved onto the stone resembles an eagle - a symbol used for @entity104 the evangelist discussing the symbolism of the piece dr @entity108 from the @entity110 ’s @entity109 , @entity111 and @entity15 told @entity112 : ‘ the cross was a completely ubiquitous religious symbol in @entity115 : much like today , it was visual shorthand for the @entity39 faith			1
‘ it can be found in manuscripts , jewellery , on coins and also sculpture			0
' people would see it every day , often in their purses or on their clothes as well as in and around their churches			0
’ he added there is a famous poem in @entity132 , called @entity133 , in which the poet experiences a vision of the cross explaining its role in the crucifixion to him			2
‘ the [ animal ] is a little harder to place , ’ continued dr @entity108			0
‘ a common form of ornamentation found on lots of stone sculpture was foliage inhabited by creatures including birds , and that could be what 's going on here			2
' but the bird on this stone looks quite aquiline , so it may well be an eagle : a symbol used for @entity104 the evangelist			1
’ this view was shared by @entity158 , a lecturer in @entity159 at the @entity160			0
he told @entity112 : ‘ given that [ the bird ] is found in close proximity to the cross , it is conceivable that it is meant to be an eagle , and thesymbol of @entity165			1
‘ this interpretation would certainly sit well with the bird ’s pronounced beak			2
’ @entity172 , valuer at @entity33 ’s added : ‘ the @entity5 stone is an important find and the stylistic vocabulary on the cross is indicative of an @entity5 origin			1
it probably dates from the 9th or 10th century			1
’ also going under the hammer at the same sale is a @entity182 sarcophagus that for years acted as a plant pot in an @entity185 garden			0
the estimate is £ 25,000 ( $ 39,200 )			2
