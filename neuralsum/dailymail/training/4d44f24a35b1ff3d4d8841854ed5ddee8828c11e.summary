‘ i was in so much pain from my stomach			0
he called an ambulance and it took me to hospital			0
i then had to be airlifted to the main hospital as they thought something was going on with my heart — it was just crazy			0
’ @entity9 claimed he could n’t bear to watch the @entity16 on tv , particularly the 10,000 metres race in which @entity37 won bronze			1

‘ i saw the results and @entity36 did really well but i just was n’t ready			0
’ @entity9 missed a block of training due to illness in july , but it was not until the opening morning of competition in @entity25 that he announced he was pulling out of the 10,000m and 5,000m			1
@entity9 hit out at @entity64 , who said she was ‘ surprised ( @entity9 did n’t ) give himself a bit more time ’ before withdrawing from the 10,000m and instead opted for the ‘ much easier ’ @entity19			1

flying the flag : @entity9 is in bullish mood ahead of the @entity19 ‘ this year i need to do something , ’ admitted @entity9			2

in track , you can get ready for 1500 , 5,000 , 10,000 and you can do a lot of speed but with the marathon it ’s just a lot of running , a lot more miles and at the end you are pretty tired			0
