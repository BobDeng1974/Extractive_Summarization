midfielder @entity0 believes the arrival of a new manager in the summer could reignite his @entity4 career			1
the 25 - year - old has struggled to re-establish himself in @entity4 ' midfield in the second half of the season after suffering a calf injury in december , and was labelled ' not up to it at the moment ahead of other people ' by boss @entity13 after being overlooked for the april 19 game against @entity15			1
@entity13 has opted to use @entity16 as his main defensive option in the middle of the park - leaving @entity0 out of the first - team picture - but the @entity21 international hopes the seemingly likely departure of @entity13 at the end of the campaign could rejuvenate his prospects in north @entity26			1
' then , new coach , new everything			0
' @entity13 was handed an 18 - month contract when he succeeded @entity40 in december , but that has not prevented reports he will be shown the door at the end of the term , with the likes of @entity47 and @entity48 touted for the role			1
@entity0 , who has been linked with a transfer to @entity51 , is unsure what his own future holds , but says a switch back to his homeland would be difficult given @entity4 's valuation of him			1
' i do not know anything yet ( about my future ) , but i 'm happy to have my name talked about with a club the size of @entity51 , ' he said			1
' ( but ) it would be very difficult to leave on loan			2
if i leave , i would have to be sold , and it is not close			2
other teams have come , but with little money			0
' on the radar : spurs are keen on @entity70 manager @entity48 to take over @entity13 has played down talk of bad blood between the pair , stemming from the player tweeting to tell fans he was not injured on the morning of the @entity15 game			2
' he 's not injured , and he 's fit to play , but he 's not selected because he 's not up to it at the moment ahead of other people , ' the 45 - year - old said after the 3 - 1 triumph			0
' i really do n't have a problem with him			0
he 's a good lad			0
i do n't have any problem with anything he 's got to say			0
he 's not being disrespectful to me , i do n't think			0
