one in four phones sold is now a @entity1 - putting the electronics giant ahead of @entity11 for the first time			1
the sales catapulted the @entity15 giant to a record $ 5.2 billion quarterly profit			0
the record figures came as a respected analyst from @entity19 warned that @entity8 would ' decline ' without @entity21 's leadership			2
' when @entity21 departed , he took three things with him , charismatic leadership , the ability to take big risks , and an unparalleled ability to envision and design products , ' says @entity29 , ceo of @entity19			0
' @entity8 ’s momentum will carry it for 24 - 48 months			2
but without the arrival of a new charismatic leader it , like @entity34 will coast , and then decelerate			0
' the new figures seem to tally with @entity38 's prediction			0
chairman @entity40 's @entity15 group , whose $ 190 billion market value is 11 times that of @entity42 rival @entity34 , sold 93.5 million handsets in the first quarter			2
during the first quarter of this year , more than one in every four phones sold was a @entity1 handset - according to @entity49 , overtaking long - time handset leader @entity11			1
the total included 44.5 million smartphones , giving @entity1 a 30.6 percent share of the high - end market			1
@entity8 's sales of 35.1 million @entity7 gave it a 24.1 percent share			1
demand for the company 's @entity58 smartphones beat expectations , and the @entity62 tablet computer also sold well @entity1 reported record first - quater profits boosted by a surge in sales of its @entity6 smartphones as it outsold @entity8 's @entity7 and became the world 's top mobile phone maker ‘ @entity1 and @entity8 are out - competing most major rivals and the smartphone market is at risk of becoming a two - horse race , ’ said @entity70 , an analyst at @entity49			1
@entity75 analyst @entity74 said in a recent report that ‘ @entity1 's smartphone success in the first quarter was the flip - side of @entity11 's disappointment			2
’ the near duopoly in high - end smartphones is unlikely to come under much threat this year or next , according to @entity84 analysts , and @entity1 will look to keep that momentum going next week with the launch in @entity87 of a third generation of @entity89 , hoping to boost sales ahead of the summer olympics , where the group is among the leading sponsors			2
‘ the @entity97 's specifications are expected to be sensational and it 's already drawing strong interest from the market and consumers , ’ said @entity94 , an analyst at @entity95			0
the new @entity6 will be powered by @entity1 's quad - core microprocessor , which the company hopes to see used in handsets sold by @entity11 , @entity105 and @entity106 , as well as @entity8 , its biggest customer for components			1
‘ we anticipate very strong demand for the @entity97 , ’ @entity109 , @entity1 's senior vice president and head of investor relations , told analysts			0
‘ when there 's strong demand in the market , we do n't necessarily need to spend a lot of marketing dollars to promote sales			0
’ analysts warned that the battle for domination of the lucrative smartphone market was becoming a ' two - horse race ' between @entity8 and @entity1 @entity1 's dominance of the mobile phone sector ends a long reign for @entity11			1
@entity11 became the world 's largest cellphone maker 1998 when it overtook @entity106 - at a time when @entity1 had just entered the industry - and it controlled around 40 percent of the market for years before @entity8 's @entity7 was unveiled in 2007 , launching the smartphone boom			1
some analysts said losing the top spot would be a blow to @entity11 , but would have little impact on its attempt to turn around its fortunes			0
‘ i think it will hurt them from a pr perspective , but in reality it does not change anything : at the end of the day the problems are the same if they remain the no 1 or become the no 2 , ’ said analyst @entity140 at @entity141			0
‘ in contrast it will be greeted with euphoria by @entity1 - they 'll be dancing from the boardroom to the factory floor , ’ @entity152 said .			0
