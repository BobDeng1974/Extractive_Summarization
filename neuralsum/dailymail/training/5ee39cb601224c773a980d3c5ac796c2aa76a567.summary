by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 16:07 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 16:28 est , 24 september 2013 catbird seat : @entity3 denied on @entity4 this week that he had used chemical weapons against his own people , and with the @entity7 seesawing on regime change , he 's positioned well to keep his job a senior @entity7 official told reporters friday that the @entity13 administration wants @entity3 ' remove [ d ] from power			1
' but an examination of the government 's vacillating position on whether the @entity20 dictator must go reveals a schizophrenic policy that has changed at least four times this year			2
'' there needs to be a political resolution to the civil war that removes @entity3 from power , ' deputy national security adviser @entity23 said during an on - the - record conference call			1
that position has been a consistent theme for eight days , but was preceded by two weeks of @entity7 assurances that the possibility of @entity1 military action in @entity20 was not intended to force ' regime change			1
' in the past six months , a @entity37 analysis reveals , president @entity13 and his senior aides have said at least seven times that @entity3 must go , but insisted on at least five other occasions that the @entity1 is n't aiming to see him leave			2
all of those assurances that the @entity7 was n't angling for regime change came after the august 21 chemical weapons attack that the @entity1 and @entity43 maintain was the work of @entity3 's armed forces			1
during a march 20 joint press conference in @entity47 with @entity49 prime minister @entity48 , president @entity13 said he believed ' that the @entity3 regime has lost all credibility and legitimacy			0
' ' i think @entity3 must go – and i believe he will go , ' the president said			0
i think @entity3 must go -- and i believe he will go			0
' a somber @entity58 told reporters on may 29 that ' as a matter of @entity1 policy that we believe that @entity3 must not continue to rule @entity20 ' what a difference ! on august 27 the same @entity58 insisted : ' i want to make clear that the options that we are considering are not about regime change ' he echoed that call the following day in a speech to the @entity49 people , saying that ' @entity3 must go so that @entity20 ’s future can begin			1
' two different @entity7 spokesmen followed suit in may			0
' we have been making clear as a matter of @entity1 policy that we believe that @entity3 must not continue to rule @entity20 , that he has massacred his own people , that he has the blood of his own people on his hands , ' press secretary @entity58 said may 29 in the @entity7 briefing room			1
standing in for @entity58 two days later , his deputy @entity81 insisted that ' we have said that @entity3 must go and that there is no future for him in @entity20			1
' and that is not just our opinion , ' he added , ' but ... that is the will of the @entity20 people that they ’ve made clear			0
' the @entity7 was officially silent on the matter through june and july , as a trio of scandals consumed its public oxygen			0
even without chemical weapons , @entity3 's forces would still pack a wallop : heavy fighting in the village of @entity97 , @entity20 included @entity99 bombs on thursday @entity13 hedged his bets on @entity101 , saying both that he had ' called for @entity3 to leave ' and that military strikes ' would not help the situation on the ground ' does the @entity106 - brokered chemical weapons agreement guarantee @entity3 will stay in power ? reporters are starting to look beneath the surface with questions to @entity112 spokeswoman @entity111 about the dictator 's ' job security ' new revelations about the september 11 , 2012 @entity117 terror attack , journalists ' complaints that the @entity120 was spying on them , and the @entity122 's admission that it had targeted conservative groups for their political beliefs pushed @entity20 – and most of the administration 's other international priorities – to the back burner			1
after the august 21 chemical weapons attack in the @entity130 suburbs near @entity131 , the @entity7 re-engaged			1
secretary of state @entity132 is pushing for the @entity133 to bare its teeth against @entity3 when it meets next week in @entity135 but suddenly , regime change was off the table as @entity13 tried to persuade @entity138 to authorize military action to neutralize @entity3 's ability to launch future chemical weapons campaigns			1
' i want to make clear that the options that we are considering are not about regime change , ' @entity58 said on august 28 during his daily press briefing			2
on august 29 , @entity13 himself offered a diplomatic analysis on the @entity149 that hedged his bets , reminding host @entity151 that he had ' called for @entity3 to leave and make sure that we got a transitional government that could be inclusive in @entity20			2
' ' what i ’ve also concluded , ' he quickly added , ' is that direct military engagement , involvement in the civil war in @entity20 , would not help the situation on the ground			0
' @entity13 was ' candid yesterday in his interview , ' a senior @entity7 official told journalists a day later , ' about the fact that we 're not talking about regime change here			1
' @entity23 said sept. 6 in @entity166 , @entity106 during the @entity168 economic summit that any action the @entity1 might take against @entity3 ' would not have the aim of accomplishing regime change			1
' @entity58 used similar language on sept. 11 in @entity173 , saying that ' the potential use of limited military strikes by the @entity1 ... was not designed to precipitate regime change			2
' but a day later at the same podium , he emphasized that ' it is still our policy and our view that @entity20 ’s future can not have @entity3 in the picture			2
' ' it ’s inconceivable , ' @entity58 explained , ' given what he has done to his own people			0
but this is something that we have said all along needs to be decided in a political settlement			0
it is not something that will be decided militarily			0
' on may 31 , @entity81 trumpeted an absolutist posture from the @entity7 podium : ' we have said that @entity3 must go and that there is no future for him in @entity20			1
and that is not just our opinion , but ... that is the will of the @entity20 people ' ... ... but national security advisor @entity202 flatly assured a left - of - center audience on september 9 that any military action the @entity1 might take ' would not aim to topple @entity3 or , by themselves , to effect regime change ' anti-war demonstrations at the @entity208 and the @entity7 have provided pressure against military intervention , which the administration now says it hopes to avoid the most recent administration statement about @entity3 's future , before @entity23 ' candid admission on friday , came during a sept. 17 @entity112 press briefing when spokeswoman @entity111 was challenged on the @entity13 government 's changing stance			1
' our position has n’t changed , that we do n’t see a future for @entity3 in – a future in @entity20 with – that includes @entity3 , ' @entity111 fumbled			2
' and that has n’t changed			0
' a reporter , however , questioned how the administration 's choice to pursue diplomacy through the @entity43 could result in deposing @entity3			2
' i understand that you want that to happen , ' he said , according to a @entity112 transcript , ' but this agreement pretty much gives @entity3 job security , do n’t you agree ? ... i mean , he is the one that is being tasked with implementing this agreement , so until the agreement is implemented , i mean , he ’s the person that will be implementing it			1
' ' no , i do n’t agree , ' @entity111 countered			0
' our view and how we have – would press this and what we 've discussed with our partners , is that any individual , any government that is in place , whether that ’s a transitional government , whatever it may be , would be in charge of implementing this			0
' @entity249 columnist @entity248 would seem to disagree			0
he observed sept. 15 on @entity251 's @entity250 that ' @entity3 used chemical weapons and improved his job security			1
that 's not a particularly good message to other dictators			0
' during friday 's conference call , @entity23 took questions from journalists at @entity101 , @entity260 , @entity251 , the @entity249 , @entity261 and the @entity262 , but did not call on @entity37 .			0

a top @entity7 deputy argued friday for a resolution in @entity20 ' that removes @entity3 from power '
but at least five times this year , administration officials have insisted they 're not working for regime change
a dozen official statements on the question have been nearly 50 - 50
a reporter asked the @entity112 on *tuesday* whether @entity3 has bought himself ' job security ' by agreeing to help *dismantle* his chemical weapons
