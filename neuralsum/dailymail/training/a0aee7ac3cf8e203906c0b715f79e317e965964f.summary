he said @entity1 had died because of the ‘ perception , prompted by the fashion industry ’ , that she should be thinner			1
calling it ‘ one of the most tragic cases to come before me in 40 years ’ , he added : ‘ the one class of person who is not here , whom i hold directly responsible for what happened , is the fashion industry			1
‘ the problem of eating disorders in young girls did n’t exist before the 1970s			1
it was from that point on that the fashion industry , the magazines that supported it and the models , promoted the thin figure			1
