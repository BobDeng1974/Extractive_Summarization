by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:15 est , 10 february 2014 @entity3 : 22:47 est , 10 february 2014 evidence from @entity7 gunman @entity6 ' cellphone - including eerie selfies he took just hours before the shooting spree - can be used by the prosecution , a judge has ruled			1
the images were taken by @entity6 before he allegedly opened fire on a movie theater in @entity13 , @entity7 during a screening of the @entity15 in 2012 , killing 12 people and injuring 70 more			1
among the photos , which have only been shown in court , is one of @entity6 wearing black contact lenses and a black stocking cap , with two tufts of his orange - dyed hair sticking out like horns			1
in another , he held a pistol beneath his face and grinned at the lens			0
a third showed an assault rifle and shotgun , magazines for ammunition , tactical gear and bags to carry rounds arrayed on a bed			0
locked up : @entity6 , who killed 12 people and injured 70 others in shooting in @entity13 , @entity7 in july 2012 took eerie selfies in the hours before the massacre			1
a judge ruled these can be used prosecutors police have testified the photos were taken about six hours before the july 20 , 2012 , shootings			1
investigators said they also found pictures on his iphone of movie theater doors taken up to three weeks before the attack , as part of his possible planning , the @entity47 reported			0
the ruling , which was made public on monday , also allows for evidence found in @entity6 ' @entity59 , computers , emails and bank records to be used by prosecutors			1
defense attorneys had argued the warrant used to seize the phone was over-broad and unconstitutional because it failed to be specific enough			2
creepy : a court sketch shows one of the photos found on @entity71			1
in the photograph , he was wearing a black stocking cap with two tufts of hair sticking out and black contact lenses allowed in court : in another image , he held a pistol beneath his face as he looked at the camera but the judge disagreed and rejected eight defense motions to suppress the evidence			1
' [ @entity87 ] o date range could have been justified , ' @entity86 district judge @entity85 wrote in the ruling			0
' officers realized that these were no impromptu crimes ; extensive planning and preparation had obviously gone into the shooting and the booby - trapping of the apartment			2
' but they had no way of knowing whether it had taken months , a year , two years , or longer to complete such planning and preparation			0
' @entity6 , a 26 - year - old former neuroscience graduate student , pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to more than 160 counts of murder and attempted murder			1
his attorneys have acknowledged he was the shooter but said he was in the grip of a psychotic episode			0
the case now hinges on whether he was insane			0
@entity111 : these images - which are not part of the contested evidence - were shared on a website , @entity115 , ahead of the attack that claimed the lives of 12 people and injured 70 others scene : prosecutors are also permitted to use evidence found on his computer , which was found during a search of his apartment ( above )			1
the defense had claimed the evidence was gathered unconstitutionally prosecutors are seeking the death penalty			2
@entity6 ' trial date is up in the air while both sides work their way through dozens of pretrial motions			2
as dramatic as the cellphone photos are , they will likely be less important to the outcome of the case than a mandatory sanity evaluation that @entity6 underwent at the state mental hospital last month			2
the verdict on @entity6 ' sanity is up to the jury , and the evaluation will be a key piece of evidence			2
the critical conclusions of the evaluation have not been made public , but prosecutors have asked for another by their own experts , saying the doctor who conducted the first one was biased			0
@entity86 district judge @entity85 has not said when he will rule on the request			0
he held a four - day hearing on the issue last month that was closed to the public and reporters			0
battle : @entity162 and victims arrive at one of @entity6 ' hearings at district court in @entity167 , @entity7 last month			0

creepy photos show @entity6 wearing black contact lenses and black stocking cap , while another shows him posing with a pistol
the images were taken about 6 hours before shooting on july 20 , 2012
a judge has allowed the prosecution to use the photos as well as other evidence from his phone , computer , emails and bank account
@entity186 had argued that investigators had only gathered the evidence by being unconstitutionally broad in their search - but judge disagreed
