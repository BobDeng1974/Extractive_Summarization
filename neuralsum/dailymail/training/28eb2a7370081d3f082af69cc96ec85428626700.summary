by @entity0 published : 20:00 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 20:03 est , 6 september 2013 token of gratitude : nurses at a @entity5 hospital have been told they must record all gifts and thank you cards they receive they were once simply a nice gesture for patients to show how much they appreciated a caring nurse			1
but now hospital staff have been told they will have to keep a monthly record of all the gifts and thank you cards they are given at work			1
nicknamed the ‘ chocolate audit ’ , nurses at the @entity19 in @entity5 have been ordered to keep a monthly tally chart of all the cards , chocolates and biscuits they receive			1
the forms are split into two columns – ‘ cards ’ and ‘ chocolates / biscuits ’			1
a statement at the bottom reads : ‘ when you are given a card or chocolates put a tally on the chart			1
this is for governance data			0
’ the charts were brought in this month and staff will have to fill them out until august next year when they will be collected by bosses			1
one staff member , who wanted to remain anonymous , said : ‘ this just leaves a sour taste in the mouth because something which was essentially a nice gesture has been turned into something bureaucratic and it is being used to monitor performance			2
’ the forms have also been criticised by campaigners who want to reduce bureaucracy in the @entity54			2
@entity55 , director of privacy campaign group @entity56 , said : ‘ you ’d hope medical staff have more important things to do than snoop on the gifts and thank you cards coming into a hospital			1
‘ it ’s a frankly bizarre idea that intrudes on the privacy of staff and patients , wastes valuable hospital time and takes micromanagement to a whole new level			2
’ he added : ‘ it ’s right that managers have the right data to run a hospital			0
‘ but when that starts to look like monitoring absolutely everything their staff are doing it stops being about management and becomes a misguided and intrusive assault on people ’s privacy			2
’ however hospital bosses said they would not use the tally charts to monitor staff performance			0
@entity88 , deputy chief nurse at @entity89 , said : ‘ a small number of wards have chosen to record the many gestures of thanks which patients make in addition to the formal monitoring of suggestions and complaints			0
anger : one nurse who did not want to be named said that the move has left ' a sour taste in the mouth ' ( file picture ) ‘ this is not something which has been imposed across the @entity107 and does not form part of a formal governance collection process			0
‘ having this record displayed enables all staff to be aware of the gestures of thanks patients have made			1
‘ therefore the sentence “ this is for governance data ” is slightly inaccurate and on reflection should have been worded differently			0
’ in 2006 a similar scheme at the debt - ridden @entity54 trust was heavily criticised by health watchdogs and branded ‘ management madness ’			0
the trust , which was £ 8million in debt and about to axe 300 jobs , ordered nurses to count how many gifts they received from patients			0
managers at the trust told staff to fill out forms stating what presents they get , who gave them and how much they are worth			1
at the time one nurse said : ‘ it ’s a complete and utter waste of time – there are 101 things we could be doing			0
‘ we are all worried about who is going to lose their jobs but at the same time we are doing fiddly little jobs like counting bags of chocolate buttons			0
