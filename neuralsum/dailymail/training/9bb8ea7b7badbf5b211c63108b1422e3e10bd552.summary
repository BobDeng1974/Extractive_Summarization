they are pictures that seem almost impossible to take - the @entity2 glowing over the haunting beauty of @entity5 's @entity4			2
but one photographer has managed to capture the immense majesty of the star - studded night sky , with all the detail of the @entity2 as it stretches above some of @entity5 's most iconic landscapes			0
@entity13 @entity12 , 58 , has been capturing images of disk shaped galaxy - which can not be distinguished properly with the naked eye - since early 2011 and has been obsessed with snapping the phenomenon ever since			1
the towering rock formations in @entity20 , @entity21 , stand tall below the disk - shaped galaxy that appears like a rainbow of the night the iridescent beauty of the @entity2 is reflected in @entity25 in a spectacular photo taken at @entity27 in what looks like rainbow of iridescent stars arched across the night sky , one photograph shows the glowing band looming over a piping hot spring in @entity27			1
and another depicts an unwitting bison grazing below an explosion of luminous colours			0
according to @entity12 , capturing these images can be a notoriously tricky process , having spent weeks under the stars taking hundreds of shots in some cases			1
toadstool rocks , in @entity44 , @entity45 , are perfectly framed by the @entity2 and a golden glow at sunrise however @entity12 , who is a part time antiques dealer , has travelled through landscapes across @entity5 to find the perfect spot , with each image taking about 30 - 40 hours to produce			1
he said : ' when capturing the @entity2 , i want it to be as beautiful and as true to life as i possibly can regardless of the time required			2
' in the end i want it to look like a fantastic watercolour painting that can fill the eye with wonder			0
' i 've always loved the sky and the stars twinkling overhead			0
@entity63 , at @entity64 in @entity65 , are illuminated y the bright night sky , with the detail of the river and trees also pickedout using a special technique when the pictures are processed an unwitting bison grazes below the spectacular night sky , with an explosion of luminous colours above its head @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity21 , is similarly brought to life with splashes of colour from the @entity2 and even some shooting stars flashing across the sky ' i am forever blown away looking up or upon seeing astro images			2
i could spend hours imagining the countless stars that exist above			0
' the @entity2 is a galaxy which contains between 100 and 400 billion stars			0
. it is thought to be around 120,000 light - years in diameter and is known for its disk shaped structure .			1

@entity13 @entity12 , 58 , has been capturing images of disk shaped galaxy since 2011
*amazing* photos show @entity2 above @entity27 and @entity97
dramatic images are notoriously *difficult* to process after hours spend capturing the perfect moment
