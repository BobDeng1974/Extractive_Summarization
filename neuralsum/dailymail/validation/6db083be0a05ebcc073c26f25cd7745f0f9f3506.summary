it 's thousands of years since mankind won dominance over nature , and we 're still pretty proud			0
but a top researcher says we 've been giving ourselves too much credit - because we were helped by our oldest friends			1
humans paired up with dogs as early as 40,000 @entity10 , it is claimed , giving us such an advantage in hunting that it prompted the wipeout of our @entity16 rivals			1

a new theory claims humans teamed up with the ancestors of domestic dogs far earlier than was first thought left behind : while early humans hunted with wolves , their @entity16 rivals in @entity30 continued using primitive tools without any help , according to anthropologist dr @entity35 ( artist 's impression ) the controversial theory has been put forward in a new book by leading anthropologist @entity35 of @entity41			1
she has challenged the common scientific view that wolves were only domesticated just over 10,000 years ago , after early humans had already asserted a strong foothold in @entity30			2
no match : the theory claims @entity16 ( model pictured ) were no match for the hunting technique instead , she said , humans began taming and breeding wolves - leading to the pets we know today - soon after they arrived on the continent from @entity57 up to 70,000 years ago			1
at the time , our close genetic relatives the @entity16 were dominant in @entity30 , fighting for survival as they hunted creatures such as woolly mammoths with primitive tools			0
but soon afterwards the rival species died out , leaving a clear path for the homo sapiens that make up today 's humans			2
strong rival theories of their demise include that @entity16 , just like woolly mammoths , were unable to cope with the changing climate of the last ice age or that humans were better hunters			2
dr @entity35 , however , told @entity74 : ' we formed an alliance with the wolf and that would have been the end for the @entity16			1
' early wolf - dogs would have tracked and harassed animals like elk and bison and would have hounded them until they tired			2
then humans would have killed them with spears or bows and arrows			0
' this meant the dogs did not need to approach these large cornered animals to finish them off – often the most dangerous part of a hunt – while humans did n’t have to expend energy in tracking and wearing down prey			1
dogs would have done that			0
' then we shared the meat			0
it was a win - win situation			0
' dr @entity35 's theory , shared in her book @entity105 : how humans and their dogs drove neanderthals to @entity109 , was partly inspired by early dog remains			1
crossing paths : wolves and woolly mammoths co-existed for millennia , but only wolves survived in the end close relation : a @entity119 employee examines a model of a @entity16 during an exhibition last year			0
neanderthals look similar to modern humans but were a distinct species with genetic differences she examined 33,000 - year - old fossils of dogs found in @entity129 and @entity130 , and looked at how the shapes of their jaws and skulls were different from wild wolves			1
although they were far more similar to wolves than the pets of today , there were clear signs of domestication , she said - including shorter snouts , densely - packed teeth and wider jaws			2
the theory is the latest in a long line about our prehistoric ancestors , many of which contradict each other			0
last year a study at the @entity154 in @entity155 claimed early humans emigrated from @entity57 far earlier than we first thought - and as many as 130,000 years ago			1
another study at the @entity159 said wolves began evolving into domestic dogs between 9,000 and 34,000 years ago , while a third study said dogs may not have evolved from wolves as we know them today at all .			0

neanderthals were wiped out after *ancient* humans arrived from @entity57
scientists disagree on why - but top anthropologist may have the answer
dr @entity35 said we paired up with wolves in *symbiotic* *partnership*
wolves cornered prey and humans made the kill , sharing meat afterwards
neanderthals were then ' no match ' for humans ' *superior* hunting *tactics*
