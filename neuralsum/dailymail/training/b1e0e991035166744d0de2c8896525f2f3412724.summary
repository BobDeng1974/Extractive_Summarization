the company have put a great deal of attention to **detail** into this model
the new @entity0 is both **effortless** and **nimble** to drive
@entity0 have **listened** to their **customers** and *simplified* the car 's interior
were it not for a press leak , this would be a test of the *latest* version of the @entity86 . that was the name *planned* for the *mid-size* *hatchback* , which in 1998 *replaced* the *longrunning* @entity89 . but @entity0 's then boss , the *mercurial* @entity91 , was so *incensed* that the *cat* had got out of the *bag* , he *changed* the name and *revealed* it just seconds before the *curtains* came up at its @entity97 *launch* . now with 12 million sold worldwide , we *'re* on the third *generation* .
@entity0 does so many things without fuss that it 's easy to take its cars for *granted* . a big mistake . the company puts a great deal of attention to **detail** into each model . so this *newcomer* is both **effortless** and **nimble** to drive , but also engaging , thanks to a crisp six - ***speed*** *manual* *gearbox* linked to a willing , yet *frugal* and award - *winning* , 1 - litre *125***bhp**** *ecoboost* **engine** .
the base price of the car i drove was £ *18,795* , but it came with a few extras including @entity122 paint ( £ **250** ) , door edge *protectors* ( £ *85* ) , but most *significantly* the @entity125 *navigation* *system* ( £ 500 ) with a big *8in* touch - screen with on the **central** *dashboard* . it includes a *splitscreen* *display* , voice - **control** of audio , *satnav* , *climate* **control** and *mobile* phones , *spoken* street *names* , 3 - d highway , *junction* and *landmark* views and even the @entity140 guide . a chunk of money , but well worth it .
the *ergonomics* make it easy to *sit* in and drive . *buttons* tend to be where you want them .
@entity151 said it 's **listened** to **customers** who asked for simplicity inside the car with *fewer* **control**s and *switches* to *navigate* around .
so a sensible *de-clutter* *results* in a cleaner , more *modern* feel to the interior with *black* satin trim and *chrome* **detail**ing . *sufficient* *space* in the back . the boot is big enough for the weekly shop .
good economy at around *60mpg* — almost *50mpg* in town , helped by s*top* - start *technology* . *acceleration* from rest to 62 *mph* is *11* seconds which , while it wo ***n't*** break any ***speed*** *records* , is fine for *family* motoring . *co2* *emissions* are low at *108g/km* .
my *zetec* trim level is the third of six which range from basic @entity184 , @entity0 , @entity1*85* , @entity186 and @entity187 *equipment* includes *16* in alloy wheels , a quick - clear *heated* *windscreen* , air *conditioning* , *remote* **central** *locking* , hill - start assist , @entity195 *cat*egory 1 alarm , *halogen* *headlamps* , *sports* - style front seats and a driver - seat lumbar adjust .
exterior styling has been *refined* to make it look more streamlined , but the main brief seems to have been , if it ai ***n't*** broke , do ***n't*** fix it .
up against tough *competition* such as the @entity209 which , although more *expensive* , is a hard act to follow .
there are some handy **parking** aids on offer , which use *ultrasonic* *sensors* to lo*cat*e **parking** *space*s and steer the car into them *automatically* . sadly on the model i tested , they were not fitted .
having plumped for a *midrange* model , you might ask what else is on offer . beyond the *standard* @entity226 trim there 's the 135*mph* @entity229 , with its **250** ***bhp*** 2 - litre @entity231 *petrol* **engine** , which hits *showrooms* this month from £ *22,195* . there 's also a 1*85* ***bhp*** diesel with a *top* ***speed*** of 135*mph* and 19in alloys , and a high - *performance* *320* ***bhp*** *2.3* - litre *allwheel* drive rs — the 30th vehicle to wear the @entity241 badge since 1968 .
