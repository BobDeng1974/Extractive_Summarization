they are extraordinary treasure troves , stuffed full of some of the greatest works of art that @entity4 has ever produced			1
but the @entity5 now wants its stately homes to have fewer exhibits – because they are too demanding on visitors			1
the charity , which owns 500 historic homes and gardens , is worried that rooms often have ‘ so much stuff ’ it puts off all but the middle classes			1
@entity5 , which owns 500 historic homes and gardens such as @entity18 in @entity19 , is worried that exhibitions often have ‘ so much stuff ’ it puts off all but the middle classes in an attempt to try to broaden the appeal of @entity4 ’s grand properties , bosses yesterday launched a ten - year strategy that includes plans to ‘ simplify ’ some exhibits			1
dame @entity30 , director general of the @entity5 , said simplifying the exhibits may be necessary			2
‘ we are making visitors work too hard in some places , ’ she said ‘ it ’s not surprising given that where we have come from , that the type of places that we own are the places where the middle classes feel more comfortable , that it forms more of their cultural background			1
‘ our analysis is that it is n’t the entrance fee that is putting people off , it is that they think this is n’t “ the place for them ” so how do we get them in ? ’ the @entity5 's director general dame @entity30 , said places like the @entity53 bridge attracts visitors from all social classes dame @entity30 , who was permanent secretary of the @entity56 until she was appointed to the @entity5 in 2012 , said that some properties have a broader appeal			1
‘ when you go to somewhere like @entity53 in @entity61 and watch people walking over the rope bridge , they are from every socio - economic background , wearing shorts , flip flops , all of that , ’ she said			2
but many of the large stately homes have a far narrower visitor base			1
the @entity5 is to experiment with simplifying the exhibits at some of its properties			2
dame @entity30 said : ‘ when it comes to our big grand houses one of the things we have to look at is the sheer number of exhibits			0
there is so much stuff in there			0
‘ let ’s not expect our visitors to look at every single picture in a room - let ’ s pick one lovely thing , put it in the middle of the room and light it really well			1
‘ let ’s just have six or seven of those things dotted around that anybody would love - it ’s not difficult			0
‘ we make people work fantastically hard - we could make them work much less hard			2
’ but she denied that the @entity5 is ‘ dumbing down ’ its approach in order to boost visitor numbers			1
‘ in many ways it is much more intellectually rewarding , ’ @entity30 insisted			0
‘ people will learn much more by looking at one object in a lot of detail , than they ever would going round a room getting a vague impression			0
’ @entity111 , chairman of the @entity5 , added : ‘ every museum and gallery has the middle class problem			1
‘ we have serious aspirations to broaden our appeal - but the worst thing we can possibly do is to semi-condescend a group of people in order to a property seem more attractive			0
’ @entity5 is also putting a renewed emphasis on the great outdoors in the spirit of its founder @entity125 , who campaigned to provide open spaces for the poor			2
as part of that goal it is working as a consultant body with councils in @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 , to look at new ways to maintain and fund urban parks			0
the @entity5 hopes to use its experience in establishing endowments - the funding model that it uses to conserve many of its historic houses - to help set up new funding models for green city spaces			0
although the @entity5 is not putting in any money to the schemes , other charities such as the @entity147 and @entity148 are also involved			0
mr @entity111 , a businessman who recently took over as chairman from outspoken journalist sir @entity152 , said outdoor space is a key way to broaden the @entity5 ’s appeal			0
‘ the fantastic opportunity for the @entity5 is that we are not confined to buildings - we have lots of parks - people do n’t have to go inside , ’ he said			1
‘ we can do lots of things to make the whole offer that we have appeal not just to people who are in their 50s and 40s but people who are in their 20s and 30s as well			0
it is an age thing , not just a class thing			0
