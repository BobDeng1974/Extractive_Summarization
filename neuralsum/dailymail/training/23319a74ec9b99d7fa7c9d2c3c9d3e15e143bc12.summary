it was a case of unlucky no 13 for @entity1 as he crashed out of the @entity2 in @entity3 in a straight sets defeat by @entity5			2
@entity1 had won his last 12 matches against @entity5 but looked off - colour against the @entity8 on friday 13th as his opponent came through to win 6 - 4 6 - 2			1
@entity5 will now face @entity10 in the semi-finals			2
@entity1 held his next serve but @entity5 took his own service game then broke the top seed again to ease 4 - 1 ahead			0
the @entity8 then powered 5 - 1 in front on his own serve leaving @entity1 with a mountain to climb in the first set			0
the number one seed did not falter with the ball in hand on his next serve to pull back to 5 - 2 then broke @entity5 to cut the gap to two games			0
@entity1 held again thanks to a @entity5 error to trail 5 - 4 then pushed his opponent all the way as he served for the set , but the @entity8 came through to take it 6 - 4			1
@entity5 started the second set in exactly the same way as the first - with a break of the @entity1 serve - before following it up with a hold and another break to move 3 - 0 clear			0
the match started in the worst possible way for @entity1 as @entity5 broke his first service game @entity1 ( right ) had previously beaten his opponent in their previous 12 meetings another hold meant @entity5 had total control of the set but @entity1 finally got a foothold at 4 - 1 after clinching on to his service game			1
a double fault by @entity5 in the next handed @entity1 two break points , and the beaten @entity54 finalist took the first opportunity to cut the gap to 4 - 2			1
however , @entity5 broke right back after @entity1 floated a chip into the net , giving him the chance to serve for the match			0
the world number 19 did just that , with an out - of - sorts @entity1 flashing a forehand wide to gift @entity66 match points			0
@entity1 pulled it back to deuce but @entity5 came through to take the second set 6 - 2 and wrap up a crushing defeat			1
