by @entity0 published : 09:17 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 12:59 est , 11 march 2013 the trial of a mentally - ill man who hacked a psychotherapist to death with a meat cleaver begins today			1
opening statements start on monday in @entity8 's murder trial after five years of uncertainty about whether he would ever be fit to stand in court			1
@entity8 was brutally killed by @entity12 , 44 , at her @entity14 office in 2008			1
his lawyers do n't dispute that he killed the 56 - year - old but they argue he was so psychotic that he should n't be held criminally responsible for her death			1
trial begins : opening statements begin today in the case of @entity8 who killed therapist @entity8 in @entity14 in 2008 prosecutors and @entity27 's family say @entity12 carried out a considered , criminal plan			1
@entity12 admitted he wanted to rob @entity27 's colleague with whom she shared an office to get money to take his sick mother to @entity34			1
@entity12 was deemed mentally unfit for court months later			1
after doctors said his condition had improved , jury selection got started in 2010 but he was again declared unfit			1
authorities say that @entity12 set out with a bag full of knives to hold up his psychiatrist for $ 40,000 , grab his mother out of a nursing home and escape with her to @entity34			1
the case has stalled for years at a time because of the schizophrenic 's mental state , which halted an attempt to try him in 2010			2
if the trial goes forward , jurors will be asked to decide whether @entity12 , who has a decades - long history of hospitalizations and hallucinations about @entity58 and @entity59 speaking to him , knew he was doing wrong when he killed @entity27			1
under arrest : @entity8 's lawyer is pursuing a rare insanity defense in a case that highlights how the legal system tends to hold even severely mentally ill people accountable for answering criminal charges they had never met			1
he had said he was frightened that she was going to attack him because her long fingernails alarmed him			2
' believe me , i wish she was never there - but i thought she was evil , ' @entity12 told a psychologist in 2010			2
' i went to kill her			2
i thought i had no choice			2
' ' everything about his thought process was so bizarre - so crazy - that the proof in the case shows he was legally insane , ' lawyer @entity82 has said			2
however prosecutors and @entity27 's family feel that , whatever @entity12 's illness , his actions bespoke a considered , violent scheme			2
' he planned this out ' and was heavily armed , said @entity90 , one of her brothers			2
' he was determined , it would seem , to stop anyone who would interfere with his plan			2
and , unfortunately , that 's where our sister fell victim to his plan			0
he should be held fully accountable			0
murdered : psychotherapist @entity8 was fatally attacked with a meat cleaver at her office by @entity8 in february 2008 ' it was an accident that @entity12 and @entity27 , a 56 - year - old therapist who specialized in helping people with relationships , met at all			1
@entity27 shared an office with psychiatrist dr @entity107 , who treated @entity12 in 1991 but had n't seen him since			1
yet in february 2008 , as an increasingly panicky @entity12 tried to craft what he saw as a rescue plan for his mother , he thought of @entity112			1
he figured the psychiatrist had money , and he 'd get it from an atm after forcing the doctor to disclose his code , @entity12 later told police and psychologists			0
' i figured a little bump on the head			0
no one would know , and i would have $ 40,000 , ' @entity12 said			0
he went to @entity112 's office one evening with a rubber mallet , a set of kitchen knives , rope , duct tape , a suitcase full of adult diapers and clothing for his mother â€” and a belief that the plan had @entity58 's blessing , he told a psychologist			1
he encountered @entity27 instead and hacked her 15 times , then seriously wounded @entity112 when he tried to save her			0
blessed : years later , @entity12 told doctors he truly did no believe he had a choice in the murder @entity12 , now 44 , was a college student when his mind abruptly began fracturing into paranoid suspicions of classmates and a preoccupation with @entity58 and the devil			1
over the years , as he was hospitalized more than a dozen times , he recounted seeing ' @entity59 ' spelled out in his mind and the ' eye of @entity58 ' on the kitchen floor , according to psychologists ' reports and court papers			0
he heard police sirens and concluded they 'd been summoned by his bad thoughts			0
he viewed pieces of paper on the street as a special message from @entity58			0
his relatives begged him to stay in mental hospitals or adult homes , but he left them , psychologists said			0
after his mother , @entity168 , moved from the @entity170 apartment they shared into a nursing home in 2004 , @entity12 grew still more erratic and fixated			0
convinced she was n't getting good care at a series of homes , he repeatedly clashed with staffers			0
two weeks before @entity27 's death , he got arrested in a scuffle with a security guard at a hospital where his mother was being treated			0
manhunt : police arrested @entity12 in 2008 at his @entity170 apartment building ' our mother is getting sick and it is making me extremely beyond any normal patience furious and unnerved , ' he wrote to his brother around that time			1
@entity12 is pursuing an insanity defense			0
it requires proving not only that he has a serious psychiatric disorder , but also that he did n't understand the nature or consequences of his actions			0
such defenses are offered for less than 1 per cent of felonies nationwide and successful only about a quarter of the time , research has shown			0
when they do succeed , defendants are acquitted but held in secure mental hospitals until - if ever - a judge decides they 're safe to release			0
a jury was being chosen for @entity12 's trial in 2010 when he refused to leave a courthouse holding cell , ran nude around a psychiatric ward and was declared unfit for court , a finding separate from an insanity defense .			0
