by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:01 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 07:29 est , 23 october 2012 transport secretary @entity2 today said the cancellation of the @entity5 franchise is ' deeply regrettable ' ministers spent £ 1million preparing to take charge of the @entity5 main line from @entity9 before resorting to pleading with sir @entity11 ’s virgin trains to continue running his trains			1
five civil servants drew up a plan for the lucrative line from @entity16 to @entity17 to be renationalised after the collapse of the franchise competition which had been won by @entity21 ’s rival @entity20			1
but as the clock ticked down to the december 9 deadline when @entity21 was due to be kicked off the @entity16 to @entity17 line , ministers were forced to ask sir @entity11 to stay on while they find a more permanent solution			1
the £ 1million price tag for the abortive plan for the line to be taken back into public control will raise further questions about the @entity34 ’s handling of big rail franchises			0
@entity37 's shadow transport secretary @entity36 today responded to the revelation by calling on ministers to ' come clean ' about the full scale of the cost of the fiasco			1
@entity20 was awarded the £ 13billion , 13 - year deal in august but @entity21 launched a legal challenge			1
as officials prepared for the @entity47 proceedings last month , ‘ significant technical flaws ’ in the contract competition were unearthed			1
three civil servants were suspended and the deal was suspended			1
in a major pr coup for @entity21 , last week transport secretary @entity2 asked sir @entity11 to continue running services after december 9 for up to 13 months			1
however , it has now emerged that the minister drew up plans to take control of the line himself , through the government ’s company , @entity60			1
the @entity5 main line is @entity63 's busiest rail route , connecting @entity16 to @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 transport minister @entity68 told @entity69 : ‘ @entity60 has been undertaking prudent contingency preparations and they will continue to stand ready should they be required			1
‘ we do not yet have final figures , but spend to date has been around £ 1 million			0
this includes expenditure on salaries and consultants			0
’ he added that the work consisted of ‘ prudent contingency preparations and they will continue to stand ready should they be required ’			0
mr @entity68 was responding to parliamentary questions			0
the @entity34 had ‘ a core team of five working wholly or partly on the contingency planning and they were supported , where needed , by colleagues from other areas of the @entity34 ’			0
@entity90 boss @entity88 boss sir @entity11 has been asked to continue running services on the @entity5 main line for up to 13 months the collapse of the deal is expected to cost taxpayers more than £ 100million in compensation and re-running a new bidding process			1
refunding the franchises is expected to cost £ 40million , but it had been predicted that the eventual bill fort taxpayers could cost £ 100million			0
the decision not to nationalise the line is likely to be raised when mr @entity2 appears in front of mps at the transport select committee at the end of this month			2
in september mr @entity2 insisted : ’ i ’m determined the trains will not stop running			2
’ the @entity108 service was reintroduced by the government - owned @entity60 on the @entity111 line @entity69 called for him to renationalise the @entity5 main line , citing the example of the @entity111 line which the @entity37 governmentt ook over in 2009 when @entity115 walked away from the franchise			2
@entity117 , @entity37 mp for @entity118 , said : ‘ as a directly operated railway , the east coast main line returned £ 187 million to the taxpayer last year			0
’ she asked how much money @entity21 will pay to the taxpayer during the period of extension to its west coast main line franchise			2
mr @entity2 said negotiations remain ongoing			2
today ms @entity36 said : ' it ’s increasingly clear that taxpayers are set to be stung for far more than the £ 40 million cost of this shambles so far admitted by ministers , with the final bill likely to top £ 100million			0
' we now know that the costs of preparing to take over the west coast line topped six figures , and the @entity138 has still not come clean about the many millions of pounds that will have to be paid back to compensate bidders for the suspended @entity144 , @entity142 and @entity143 franchises			0
' it ’s time for the government to accept that it is completely unacceptable for the @entity34 ’s own board to investigate itself			0
' taxpayers deserve a truly independent inquiry into what went wrong and who was to blame for so much of their money being poured down the drain			0

@entity20 won competition to take over running @entity63 's busiest rail route from @entity21 but deal was *scrapped* after ' significant ' flaws were found
five civil servants worked on plans for route to be renationalised and run by government 's @entity60
transport secretary @entity2 is now in talks with sir @entity11 to carry on running services while he sorts out the mess
