' the other players have been great			0

' she does n't ask for any special treatment , ' coach @entity71 said about his no - nonsense approach to incorporating @entity0			2
' she 's not trying to show anybody up , she really just trying to do her thing and if a boy takes it the wrong way , that 's on him , not on her			2
' ' she 's got to walk in the middle of [ the football huddle ] and tell them what to do and when to do it and they better listen to her ... and they do , ' the coach added			2

but this is like any other game			0
you just have to get in the zone and play			0
' despite @entity0 's enthusiasm , her parents are carefully monitoring their daughter in the contact sport known for harrowing injuries			1
