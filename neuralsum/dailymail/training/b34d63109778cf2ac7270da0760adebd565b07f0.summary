@entity0 have completed the £ 9.8m transfer of @entity2 from @entity3			1
the @entity4 agreed a deal in principle for the versatile midfielder last month , and the necessary documentation has now been finalised			1
can becomes @entity0 's third signing of the summer , following the capture of @entity11 and @entity12 from @entity13 down for @entity2 : i 'm glad to be part of the @entity0 family done deal : @entity0 have confirmed the signing of @entity3 's @entity2 new home : can posing outside @entity0 's @entity21 training ground video i want to be a @entity23 champion - can signal of intent : manager @entity26 has been busy trying to sort incomings out early on for next year upon sealing the switch to @entity30 , the 20 - year - old told the club website : ' i am proud to be a part of the family and i am looking forward to playing here			1
i will give it my best			1
' @entity36 is a great club and the fans are amongst the best in the world			1
i am looking forward to the first game and ca n't wait to step on the pitch for the first time at @entity30			1
' i want to thank the manager for trusting me and allowing me to play here			2
i am proud to be a part of the family and i am looking forward to playing here			2
' it was an easy decision for me to sign with @entity0 as i had a very good chat with the manager , which clearly shows that he and the club wanted to sign me			1
' i want to give it my best and help the team as much as i can			2
i believe this season the team finished second in the league , so i want to be a @entity23 champion next season			2
' he also discussed his ambition to play in the @entity57 , signalling that it was a key factor behind his decision to move , adding : ' playing in the @entity57 is a dream come true for every footballer			2
' i have a total of seven appearances now and these sort of matches are not comparable to any other games			2
' i hope we will progress as far as we can and i am looking to compete against the best teams in @entity69			2
i believe we will play a good role in next year 's competition			1
' ambition : can is hoping to make a big impact in next season 's @entity57 the boot room : he has spoken of his enthusiasm at playing for the club can made 29 @entity80 appearances last season , scoring three goals for @entity3 , in addition to seven @entity57 run - outs			1
and @entity26 is delighted to have brought him to the club , telling @entity87 : ' @entity2 is an exciting young talent and i 'm delighted he 's chosen @entity0 for the next phase of his development and growth as a player			1
' ' he has recognised that we are a club that improves and nurtures exciting , ambitious players and i 'm looking forward to seeing him take those next steps forward for us			0
' we have tracked his progress for some time and i have been impressed with his attitude and qualities when i have seen him play both in the @entity80 and the @entity57			0
' he has many of the attributes we look for ; charisma on the football pitch and courage to want the ball and make things happen			0
' can was one of the most versatile young players in the @entity80			0
having spent most of his career so far in the youth set up at @entity118 , the @entity120 - born player was one pipped for the top from an extremely early age			1
after only four first - team appearances at @entity118 , though , @entity124 's star faded during the 2012/13 season , and so in the summer of 2013 he chose to make the switch to @entity3			1
it has done him a world of good , and he has developed into an invaluable midfield force for his new club			0
he has also represented @entity132 at every level from under 15 to under 21			0
can prefers to play in central midfield - ' either attacking or defending , i do n't care either way ' - but has been employed as a centre - back and a left - back on various occasions			1
as captain of the @entity142 under 17s team , he was the calming influence at the heart of play			0
his physical strength is of particular use going forward , though he is rarely overly reckless			0
it has been remarked on several occasions that can seems to have a maturity beyond his years , and his technical ability as a playmaker , either from the back or the front , is now beyond doubt			0
the most commonly drawn comparison is @entity158			0
and not only because the young @entity2 puts as much effort into his hairstye as @entity158 once did			0
his ability to switch effortlessly from defence to midfield , his dangerous shot , and his control over the pace of the game all do remind one of the established @entity118 star			0
for those watching his marauding runs through the centre at @entity3 this season though , @entity170 has always also sprung to mind			1
it is little surprise that these two @entity118 stars have had an influence on can 's play			0
he has trained with them , or at least in close proximity to them , for several of his formative years			0
@entity183 @entity184 ' excited ' by signings			0

can joins @entity0 from @entity3 in £ *9.8million* deal
becomes @entity26 third signing of the summer
@entity0 have already landed @entity11 and @entity12
the 20 - year - old is an *energetic* **box** - to - **box** midfielder
