the 45 - year - old , who was otherwise healthy and not in any pain , had been suffering with severely discoloured gums for four weeks before he sought medical help			0

a @entity3 man whose gums turned black was suffering from an extremely rare form of cancer			1
the 45 - year - old , who was otherwise healthy and was n't in any pain , was diagnosed with mucosal melanoma the patient was suffering what 's known as mucosal melanoma - a rare form of melanoma that accounts for less than five per cent of cases			1
melanocytes , the pigment producing cells of the body , are also present in the mucosal surfaces of the body , lining the sinuses , nasal passages , oral cavity , vagina , anus and other areas			0
approximately 50 per cent of mucosal melanomas begin in the head and neck region , however			2
just like melanocytes in other parts of the body , these can transform into cancerous cells , resulting in mucosal melanoma			2
but unlike most cases of melanoma of the skin , mucosal melanoma is not considered to be related to or affected by uv exposure			1
unlike most cases of melanoma of the skin , mucosal melanoma is not considered to be related to or affected by uv exposure			1
( human melanoma cells are pictured ) also , because there are no clear risk factors - including family history - diagnosis often comes late and survival rates are low			0
five year survival rates for mucosal melanoma are around 40 per cent , compared to more than 90 per cent for cutaneous			0
there are around 120 - 130 cases of mucosal melanoma diagnosed each year in the @entity67 , according to @entity68			2
in this case , however , once doctors discovered the man 's black gums were due to cancer , they removed the affected parts of the gum plus a 2cm margin of the surrounding area , according to the case notes			0
tests revealed that cancer had not spread and six months later , the cancer had not reappeared .			0

called mucosal melanoma , 50 *%* of cases of it occur in the head or neck
unlike melanoma that affects the skin , it is not related to uv exposure
