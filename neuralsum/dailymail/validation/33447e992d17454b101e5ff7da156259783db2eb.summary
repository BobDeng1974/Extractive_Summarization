the moment the names came out of the hat , @entity0 had to play @entity3 in an @entity5 quarter - final			2
the same when @entity6 met @entity7 in the @entity8 in 2009			0
administrators must have winced , but that was the hand they had been dealt			0
no doubt there were similar misgivings at @entity15 when @entity16 were paired with @entity17 in the 2016 @entity19 qualifiers			0
whoever arranged for @entity21 to meet the @entity22 in @entity23 on june 7 , however , is a numpty			1
fans invaded the pitch at @entity27 after @entity0 beat @entity3 in the @entity5 the last time @entity21 played @entity29 in @entity23 in 1995 the game was abandoned due to crowd trouble the game in 1995 was marred by crowd violence and was called off after 22 minutes the two sides met at @entity35 for a friendly in 2013 when they played out a 1 - 1 draw after intense negotiations with police , the kick - off time has now been brought forward to 1pm			1
why is it being played at all ? there are 209 member associations of @entity44 , which means there are 207 countries that @entity21 could play without fear of significant disturbance , and one where @entity21 ’s last visit was abandoned due to a riot			1
if a free draw sends @entity21 back to @entity23 , both sides will have to handle it — but this is an unnecessary risk , and not worth taking			2
if it ends in tears , and tear gas , again , those who came up with this incendiary fixture should not look far for the blame .			0
