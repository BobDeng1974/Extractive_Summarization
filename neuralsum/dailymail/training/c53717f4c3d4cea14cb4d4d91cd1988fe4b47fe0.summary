i 'm very glad and grateful to be the no 1 seed at @entity2 this year			1
i always try to perform at my best here			2
it was the tournament i always dreamed of winning and in 2011 my dream came true : i won @entity2 and became @entity7 in the world in just a matter of days			1
hopefully i can go for a second title this year			1
the highlight of my career is that 2011 @entity2 final			1
i went back home and celebrated with my people and i will never forget it			2
they are memories that will be ingrained in my heart forever			2
that ’s sport , though			2
it ’s not the first match i ’ve lost in my career so i got over it and now i ’m ready to focus on @entity2			1
some players like to take part in tournaments to adjust to the transition from clay to grass but i did n’t plan to play any tournaments on grass courts prior to @entity2			1
then , because of the fact i spent so much energy - both physical and mental - at @entity50 , i just felt like i needed more time to rest and recharge my batteries			1
i ’ve spent the last week in @entity52 , practising on the grass to get ready for the most prestigious tournament in our sport			2
i love this city because of the access to nature and the great parks			2
on the ball : @entity20 's batteries are recharged after a break in @entity27 following the @entity26 @entity64 and @entity65 are walking distance from the house we rent for @entity2 and suddenly you ’re there , seeing nature			1
i even saw deer the other day			2
i could n’t believe it : a wild safari and yet so close to town			2
@entity52 ’s a very international city and the more i come back , the more i like it			2
who knows , maybe one day i ’ll live here ! i drive a sports car right now but i think i ’m going to have to give it up in a couple of months because i ’m going to become a father			2
my days of driving two - seater cars are over although i rarely get to drive it because i ’m travelling all the time			1
between matches at @entity2 i eat a lot of carbohydrates : pasta , rice , potatoes and vegetables and maybe some kind of protein , like fish , chicken or turkey			1
i just keep it simple to avoid any problems with digestion			0
big year : @entity20 ( left ) pictured with fiancee @entity98 at a dinner for his foundation in @entity52 last year @entity101 , 10 players have won the men ’s singles title after losing the final the year before			1
@entity105 – lost 1957/won 58 @entity106 – 1960/61 @entity107 – 1969/70 @entity108 – 1971/72 @entity109 – 1980/81 , 1982/83 @entity110 – 1988/89 @entity111 – 1989/90 @entity33 – 2007/08 @entity112 – 2008/09 @entity113 – 2012/2013 i like being in the kitchen , but i like to be the consumer rather than the cook			1
my parents still have a restaurant in the mountains back in @entity121 , which the family has had for 20 years			0
we serve mainly @entity125 food and i spent a lot of time in the restaurant so i know how to prepare the most basic things , but if i see there is somebody who has more expertise then i leave it to them			0
the beauty of @entity2 is you have so many houses around the @entity136 for the players to use			1
i ’m staying in a house with my fiancee @entity139 and the rest of my team			0
we have a chef and fresh , organic food every day , which is great			0
i ’ve stayed in the same house for the past five years but we ’ve changed this time			0
when we have free time we ’ll take a walk			0
i also like listening to @entity121 music , and songs from the 1980s and 1990s			0
i ’m a bit old school when it comes to that			0
but before a match i listen to djs ’ remixes of commercial sounds to get the adrenaline flowing			0
on the court : @entity20 speaks with his coach @entity110 ( left ) as they prepare for @entity2 over the years you gain the experience to deal with the stress of playing , particularly at @entity2			1
after all , it ’s the most important tournament we have and the pinnacle of the sport			0
as the tournament progresses and the matches get tougher the tension rises and you feel that			0
mentally , it drains you			0
you have to conserve energy off the court and be around people that you care about and make you feel relaxed			0
it ’s very important when you ’re in the middle of a @entity180			0
i practise yoga , although not every day			0
each day i do certain types of breathing exercises to help me relax and focus			0
the matches at @entity2 are so important that you can easily get carried away , so you have to constantly work on yourself and try to get yourself in the best positive shape , physically and mentally			1
new wheels : @entity20 pictured with the new @entity190 at a launch in @entity52 last week i like the tradition of @entity2 and @entity193 in general ; the way culture and history is nurtured			1
not many countries have succeeded in maintaining that sense of tradition			0
you feel it here the most			0
we still have to wear all - white on the court and it gives @entity2 that special sensation and flavour of being the oldest tournament we have			1
@entity20 is the brand ambassador for @entity190 and unveiled the new @entity190 model in @entity52 last week .			1

@entity20 and his fiance @entity98 are *expecting* their first child this year
the world no 2 finished runner - up to @entity113 in the 2013 @entity2 final
