@entity0 with his pet cockerel fudge who was found dead on saturday following complaints from neighbours about its crowing a schoolboy 's beloved pet cockerel has been found dead in its pen following a dispute with neighbours over his early morning crowing			1
@entity13 nursed the bird named @entity15 back to health after he found it wandering around injured			1
the two became so inseparable that the cockerel would watch tv on the 11 - year - old 's knee			0
@entity23 began complaining when @entity15 crowed each morning at 5am when @entity13 's courier driver father , @entity24 , 38 , left for work			2
when he switched on the lights @entity15 would cocka - doodle - do thinking that it was sunrise			2
the housing association who own the @entity13 's house in @entity31 , @entity32 , told the family that @entity15 had to go by january 2 as they were breaking their tenancy agreement			1
the family then set about finding a new home for the cockerel , as the @entity38 warned them they could be prosecuted for releasing @entity15 back into the wild			1
but on saturday , before @entity13 had a chance to re-home his pet , he found fudge dead			1
he had been set to give the cockerel to a new owner after @entity46			1
mr @entity13 said someone had cut the chain on @entity15 's pen and snapped its neck			2
the father - of - three said : ' it ca n't have been a fox as there was no blood and the other chicken we own was fine			0
' the chain on the pen was broken and his neck had clearly been snapped so we think one of the neighbours who complained killed him			2
' the police have been informed , but mr @entity24 said they had no evidence to suggest who killed @entity15			0
he added : ' @entity13 was really really upset			0
i have been left with three absolutely devastated children who have been left without their pet just before @entity46			2
' i really hope we find who did it			0
' a @entity74 spokeswoman said police had not been able to establish exactly how @entity15 had died and had told the @entity13 family to take their pet to find out			1
@entity0 's father @entity24 , above , said his son and his two other children had been left ' absolutely devastated ' following the death , just days before @entity46 @entity0 had found a new home for his pet and was going to give @entity15 to a new owner next week ms @entity0 said the family could n't afford to do that , and he believed the cause of death was obvious			1
an @entity38 spokeswoman said : ' we are alarmed and concerned to hear reports that someone may have killed this cockerel because of the noise he made			0
' if it is true , this sounds like a completely pointless and callous act			0
we can only hope that the cockerel was killed by someone experienced in a quick , effective and humane way			0
' the @entity38 said anyone with information about the death should contact them .			0

@entity0 took the cockerel in after finding it *walking* about injured
the family had been told to re-house @entity15 by january 2 by their *landlord*
a new owner had been arranged to take the pet after @entity46
but on saturday @entity0 found @entity15 dead in its pen with a broken neck
