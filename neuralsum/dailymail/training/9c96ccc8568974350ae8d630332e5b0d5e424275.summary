in an unusual example of vigilante justice , the retailer , whose store had been hit by a spate of thefts over the previous two weeks , pinned shoplifter @entity9 to the ground , took a pair of scissors and hacked off her long dark hair			1
@entity2 , 32 , had lost hundreds of pounds worth of goods from thefts at her store at a shopping centre in @entity33 , @entity4 , so decided to keep a close watch on @entity9 when she saw her acting suspiciously			1
she said : ' i watch so many people everyday , so i can tell thieves from others easily			2
' when i noticed the woman sneaking around in the shopping mall , i knew she was up to no good			2
' so , when she came into my shop , i was alert and finally caught her in the act			2
' miss @entity2 was helped by a neighbouring shop owner who held @entity46 down while she cut off chunks of her hair			1
the pair then called the police and had the shoplifter arrested			0
miss @entity2 added : ' i decided to do it to teach her a lesson and to send a message to other thieves in the area to stay away from my shop			1
' miss @entity2 is by no means the first shopkeeper to dish out a painful lesson to thieves			1
last year @entity61 retailer @entity59 became an internet sensation when @entity64 footage of him apprehending a thief went viral			0
the thief tried to steal Â£ 2.30 worth of milkshake - but did n't bargain on shopkeeper mr @entity59 being a former @entity67 champion			0
he was hailed the internet 's next ' @entity68 ' after he posted the @entity64 footage on @entity71			0
@entity81 thief @entity80 managed to escape the clutches of the security guards at the store he was trying to rob after they spotted him acting suspiciously and gave chase			2
but @entity87 's bizarre practice of dancing while he stole came back to haunt him			0
@entity64 footage of him showing off his moves while stuffing his waistband with products he had n't paid for back in 2011 became an internet hit and he was arrested after someone recognised him			0
