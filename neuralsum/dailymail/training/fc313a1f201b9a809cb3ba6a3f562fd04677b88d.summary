in reaching a verdict , following a six - day inquest at @entity37 , mrs @entity33 said ms @entity1 had ' died of natural causes to which neglect contributed '			1
she added : ' the failures i found are gross because they were so terribly simple			0
' without one or more of these gross failures , @entity1 would have survived			2
' she was at risk of the very thing she died of and that risk had been told to staff by a social worker			0
' it should have been obvious she was not drinking sufficiently for at least the last two weeks			0
it does not require medical training			0
' most of the errors catalogued centred around the staff 's failure to call a doctor , despite repeated requests from mrs @entity21 , and to properly investigate ms @entity1 's worrying weight loss			2

' i 'm disgusted with them and hope it affects them for the rest of their lives			0
' @entity92 's legal advisor , @entity91 , said the coroner should feel comforted the home closed in 2011 and that the authority had replaced a large number of its care homes with four care centres			2
he said an internal review of how paperwork was updated and stored had taken place and that the @entity102 had carried out subsequent inspections			0
