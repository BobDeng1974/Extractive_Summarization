the five - year - old has never had his hair cut , and his golden locks tumble past his waist			2
but after being mistaken for a girl , he is demanding a trip to the barber – and any tears on the day are more likely to come from his reluctant mother			2
golden locks : @entity1 , five , has to tie his hair back in school because it is a health and safety risk			1
his two - year - old brother @entity17 has also never been to the barbers @entity19 , 30 , said : ‘ when @entity1 was born he had a lovely little curl of golden hair at the back of his head			1
‘ i just could never bear to get it cut , not even his fringe			0
‘ now it flows all the way down his back to his bottom and is very beautiful and soft			2
when we go out he is often mistaken for a little girl			0
people say , “ is n’t she gorgeous ” , but it has never bothered him			0
hair today , gone tomorrow : @entity1 , five , will finally have his hair cut during his @entity41 holidays ‘ it was only when he joined school and had to have it tied back in a ponytail , for health and safety , that some of the other little boys began to make fun			1
‘ they said he could not play with them because he looked like a girl			0
‘ i ’ve already cried at the thought of him having it cut , and will cry again when it actually happens			0
’ miss @entity19 , from @entity57 , @entity58 , said her son inherited his curls from her partner @entity61 , 48 , a painter and decorator			0
she added : ‘ @entity1 said he wants it shorter , and spiky on top			1
the barber will be under strict instructions not to take too much off			2
there will be no use of clippers			0
’ cut it out ! the schoolboy from @entity58 has been teased by classmates for looking like a girl and has asked his mother @entity76 to get his hair trimmed the youngster is raising money for charity by having his hair cut , and has already collected £ 82 from relatives , friends and classmates at @entity85 primary school			1
the money will be donated to @entity89 children ’s unit , where @entity1 spent a week and a half in 2010 , suffering from skin infection impetigo			1
