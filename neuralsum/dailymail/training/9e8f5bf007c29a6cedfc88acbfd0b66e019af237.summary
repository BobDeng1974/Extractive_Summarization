@entity0 inspired relegation - threatened @entity1 as they made a mockery of current @entity4 form with their most comprehensive win of the season			1
the @entity8 club came into the contest with just one victory in 15 matches and engulfed by local chit - chat that their manager @entity13 was under pressure			0
but they played with a freedom of expression that belied their status a place above the drop zone as @entity23 ’s wanderers came crashing down to earth 72 hours after negating @entity24 at @entity25			0
@entity0 ( second right ) watches on as his blistering strike puts @entity1 four - nil up against @entity27 @entity28 ( left ) wheels away in celebration after scoring his side 's fourth goal on 57 minutes @entity1 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity33 6 ; @entity34 7 , @entity35 7 , @entity36 7 , @entity37 6 ; @entity38 6 , @entity39 7 , @entity40 7 , @entity41 7 ( @entity42 90 mins ) ; @entity28 8 ( @entity43 82 mins ) , @entity44 7 ( @entity45 90 ) subs not used : @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 goals : @entity41 2 , @entity44 23 , @entity39 44 , @entity28 57 booked : @entity41 @entity27 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity52 ; @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ; @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 6 ( @entity61 51 , 6 ) ; @entity62 5 ( @entity63 74 ) , @entity64 5 ( @entity65 65 , 6 ) subs not used : @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 goals : @entity61 77 , @entity53 79 booked : @entity63 referee : @entity72 ( @entity73 ) indeed , @entity27 were plunging towards only their second defeat in any competition since october as early as the second minute when former @entity76 midfielder @entity38 marked his full @entity1 debut by picking out @entity78 , who connected with an unstoppable far - post volley			1
it was one of three goals before the interval as @entity23 was left seething on the touchline			0
the home team ’s second midway through the half , like the first , was created down the right as @entity28 exploited the space behind wing - back @entity60 to fire in a cross-shot from the edge of the box – @entity27 goalkeeper @entity52 could only parry and @entity44 tapped in his first goal of a loan spell from @entity95			1
@entity27 dominated the rest of the period after @entity23 re-shaped to a 4 - 4 - 2 formation but were left fuming when referee @entity72 dismissed claims for a penalty when @entity56 was tripped			1
in fact , the water bottle booted by @entity23 was still in motion when @entity28 completed a stunning counter-attack by clipping onto the head of @entity39 , whose glanced finish went in off the post			2
although it was all over bar the shouting , @entity1 saved their best for a dozen minutes after the re-start as @entity28 skirted the fringe of the area before arrowing a left - footed drive beyond @entity52			2
@entity78 opened the scoring for @entity1 inside the opening two minutes with a left - footed finish @entity41 ( right ) celebrates his goal that gives the hosts a great start to the match at @entity122 @entity44 ( centre ) celebrates his strike with his @entity1 team - mates which puts them 2 - 0 ahead @entity39 ( right ) added a third just before half - time as the @entity126 took a commanding lead into the interval @entity39 holds aloft both arms in delight after scoring @entity1 's third against @entity27 on tuesday night further tinkering by @entity23 followed and @entity27 played the final stages with their captain @entity133 employed as a makeshift striker			1
his physicality made an impression too as wanderers struck twice inside the final quarter hour			0
first , substitute @entity61 burst from midfield to prod past @entity33			0
then , @entity53 popped up to force a close - range header past @entity33 to offer the travelling support brief hope of a dramatic conclusion			0
but @entity1 held on for their first win at the @entity122 for more than three months to open up a five - point buffer between them and the @entity4 drop zone			1
@entity27 boss @entity23 would have been far from impressed at his side 's showing at @entity1			2

@entity78 opened the scoring for the hosts on two minutes
@entity44 and @entity39 put @entity1 3 - 0 before half - time
@entity0 made it 4 - 0 just before the hour mark
@entity61 and @entity133 scored late *consolations* for the *vi*sit*ors*
@entity1 *sit* 21st in the @entity4 , while @entity27 are 16th
