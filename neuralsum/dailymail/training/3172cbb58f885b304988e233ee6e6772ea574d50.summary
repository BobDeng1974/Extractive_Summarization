@entity11 used the investor loans to buy distribution and production rights to films including the 2010 re-make of the 1980s tv series @entity42			1
investors could make significant profits if the films prospered at the box office			0
however , @entity46 , which ran the partnership , admitted in 2011 that ‘ box office performance had not met expectations ’ and was unlikely to deliver ‘ significant upside ’			0
regardless of the poor returns , investors were able to claim tax relief worth about half the cash they put in			1

he added : ‘ it seems from reports in the media that @entity25 does have reservations about some of these types of investments			0
' i always want to be transparent about and indeed comfortable with my investments and my tax affairs , so earlier this year i resigned my subscription to this particular investment and handed back all the tax gain i had made , plus interest , to @entity25			0
‘ any earlier correspondence with @entity25 was handled by my financial advisors at the time			0
i now have a new accountancy firm and financial advisor for my affairs			0
’ mr @entity88 said he was advised that @entity11 ‘ had been submitted to @entity25 and had met with no objection or query ’ and he had instructed his financial advisers that he ‘ did not wish to be involved in aggressive tax avoidance ’			1
@entity6 said : ‘ i did not regard this as tax avoidance			0
i would n’t have done it if it had n’t been @entity25 - approved			0
’ @entity46 denied that @entity11 , or any of its other film and music investment schemes , are tax - avoidance structures			1
a spokesman said @entity11 was a ‘ bona fide film partnership ’ that traded for ‘ under six months before the capital was returned to partners in march 2009 ’			2
@entity11 is one of more than 1,200 alleged avoidance schemes identified by @entity25 where investors are being forced to hand over unpaid tax before their disputes are settled by a tribunal .			1
