by @entity0 published : 05:53 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 04:35 est , 11 october 2013 @entity2 fans of one red headed blogger were left bemused as @entity4 linked her posts to a ‘ similar ’ page – that of a flame - haired porn star			1
@entity8 , an author , marketing expert and former @entity11 speaker , who blogs at @entity12 , realised when the social media giant gets it wrong , they get it very wrong			0
the site ’s targeted advertising algorithms , used to tailor the ads a person sees on their page , suggested fans of @entity12 might also be interested in @entity22 ’s page			0
mix up : blogger and marketing executive @entity8 was bombarded with messages to say @entity4 's targeted advertising was linking her blog page with that of @entity29 porn star @entity28 there @entity28 , a @entity29 model , web developer and editor , says ‘ i write on my blog about sexy things , ’ describing herself as a ‘ geeky redhead b * * * job devotee ’			1
the social networking site linked miss @entity22 ’s pages , which have 15,000 likes , ‘ the art of b * * * job ’ and ‘ @entity43 * * * job ’ with miss @entity8 ’s blog page , which has 11,000 likes			1
writing her @entity12 blog , ms @entity8 , from @entity50 , @entity51 , said : ‘ for the past few weeks , i ’ve gotten a flood ( a metric f * * kton , if you will ) of emails , @entity4 messages , and wall posts from readers informing me of the following : ' @entity59 : speaking of branding , this “ similar to @entity63 writing … @entity22 ” , was posted immediately under this post in my news feed			1
‘ two thoughts , # 1 , @entity4 is sentient and knows what i want			2
# 2 , @entity4 is drunk			2
’ but days later , taking the mix up in good spirits , she took to her @entity4 page posting : ‘ since @entity4 thinks i ’m a porn star , i decided to rebrand			1
’ seductive : flame - haired porn star @entity28 blasted the ' @entity75 ' the red head then added a gallery of seductive shots of her posing on a bed , topless and covering her modesty with her arm			0
she said : ‘ now , @entity28 ’s a pretty hot sandwich and i ’m flattered that @entity4 thinks we ’re similar			2
‘ after all we are both redheads			0
might i also say that we both respectively have a nice set of boobs ? and we ’re both industry professionals			0
’ initially miss @entity8 assumed her fellow red head must have launched an advertising campaign targeting keywords and interest , including red hair or redhead			1
but she added : ‘ @entity28 ( a very lovely lady ) contacted me and said she ’s not running @entity4 ads. so yeah – this is all the work of @entity4 ’s awesome algorithms			2
how awesome is that ? ! ’ taking to her @entity4 page , @entity28 added : ‘ @entity4 decided that this ( non-porn ) red head , @entity102 and i have similar pages			1
‘ she wrote a great piece about our common trait : our hair ! ' plus , she took some beautiful photos to highlight our potential similarities , ( to clarify , i did n't buy any @entity4 ads. @entity75 )			1
’ a @entity4 spokesperson said : ' at @entity4 we 're always trying to help people discover things that might be interesting to them			2
' we use some pretty smart , complex technology that gets it right most of the time			0
in this case , the technology made an unfortunate comparison			0
' it 's definitely not a reflection on @entity8 and we 're glad she took it in good humour			0
we 're satisfied that this is a pretty rare case			0

adult *actress* 's page linked to blog
both women *unaware* of association until followers commented
@entity4 's *automated* process linked pages ' because of women 's red hair '
