@entity0 , 39 , from @entity1 , @entity2 , has lost a staggering 6st to go on to compete professionally as a body builder			1
at his heaviest @entity0 weighed 18st 9lb , and a 40in waist			1
unable to climb stairs without becoming breathless and embarrassed of his body , @entity0 still struggled to curb his addiction to junk food			1
@entity0 went from an unfit 18st 9lb ( left ) to a nationally comepetative body builder at 12st 9lb ( left ) junk food addict @entity0 would sometimes eat several take - aways in a single day he commented ; ' i knew my eating was getting out of control when , to my shame , i once called the local chip shop three times in one night , firstly to order a steak pie supper , second to order a black pudding supper and then again to order a fish supper			1
' i knew i was gaining a lot of weight but i could n't stop eating and drinking			2
some nights i would go to @entity26 at 2am in the morning for a @entity27 , nuggets and a @entity29 ! i was out of control			2
' i could barely climb the stairs , i would get so breathless and the sweating was something else			1
i would n't go swimming or ever change in front of anyone			0
people stare at you when you 're bigger			0
' the moment of realisation came for @entity0 when he went shopping for a new pair of jeans			2
he believed he was a size 36in waist but after trying a few pairs on he noticed that he had fluctuated to a size 40in waist			0
from that moment on , @entity0 cut out all sugar from his diet , stopped drinking and joined his local football team			2
@entity0 's size was taking a toll and he was shocked that he had gone up four sizes before he began his diet ( left )			1
now he eats a strict six meals a day of low fat , high protein foods to achieve his physique ( right ) as a result he lost 6st in the first 5 months and started regularly going to the gym			1
it was here that he met some advanced bodybuilders who inspired him to start weight training			0
since then he has undergone a complete body transformation and has started competing professionally as a middleweight body builder			0
adopting a regimented diet plan of six small meals a day @entity0 now starts his day with rolled oats and phd chocolate protein , followed by five meals of either rice or sweet potatoes with grilled chicken and vegetables			1
' the guys at the gym recommended i start taking protein supplements to help me gain muscle mass , so i tried the phd pharma whey shake and loved it ! from being too embarrassed of his body to go swimming , @entity0 is now confident posing in front of thousands in just a tiny pair of pants ' i add it to my porridge first thing in the morning , and use their protein chocolate bars as a treat in between workouts			1
' the meal plan is strict but you get used to it			0
i get up and make all my meals for the day so i 'm ready			0
' now @entity0 , who recently won the title @entity100 middleweight champion in the @entity103 competition , not only has a new body but a new passion in life which has changed his outlook completely			2
' i love everything i 'm doing now			0
' i can stand on stage in front of thousands of people in a tiny pair of pants and feel confident			0
it is so different to how i felt before			0
