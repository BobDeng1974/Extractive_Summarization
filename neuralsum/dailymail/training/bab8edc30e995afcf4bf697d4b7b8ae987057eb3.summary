by @entity1 reporter published : 07:54 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 08:29 est , 12 november 2013 a @entity3 boy is fighting for his life after his mother forced him to drink petrol and then set him on fire			1
authorities said the four - year - old was abused then torched in a grotesque plot by his mother to get revenge on her husband who she felt was not treating her with the ' proper respect '			1
the tragedy happened in the city of @entity17 in @entity18 in the east of @entity3			0
the woman , 40 - year - old @entity35 , and the man , 48 - year - old @entity36 , were both divorced and had then married each other			1
before their marriage , @entity36 lived with her daughter , @entity40 , who is a college student now			2
after they were married @entity36 and @entity35 had their own son , a boy called @entity44			1
but the two were always rowing about money			0
at the start of this month the woman - after a particularly heated argument - had left the apartment to return with a can of petrol			1
she had then tried to force her son to drink it but had only been partially successful as the boy had tried to fight once the first sip had gone into his mouth			2
getting a divorce : the boy 's father @entity36 ( pictured ) was also badly burnt after he tried to intervene when the mother reportedly dragged his son towards a naked flame on the stove ' i hope i never have to see her again ' : @entity36 suffered 15 per cent burns over his body as his father tried to intervene , she dragged the boy towards the naked flame on the gas stove , spilling petrol over all three of them - and they then all caught fire			1
despite the burns , the father rushed with the boy into the living room where he wrapped his head in a blanket to extinguish the flames			2
the boy is now in intensive care			0
doctors say the boy has 35 per cent burns mainly over his head , but also that his lungs had been badly damaged from the petrol and the flames			1
even if he survives they say he will almost certainly not be able to speak and will most likely be blind			2
the woman and her husband were also hospitalised with 15 per cent burns over their body			0
the woman faces criminal charges once the police investigation is complete - but for @entity36 his world has ended			0
he said : ' i just ca n't understand it , she had disputes with me about money and she was so furious and angry that she felt the need to lash out by injuring that which was most important to me - my darling son			0
he 's her son too , i just do n't understand it			0
' i hope i never have to see her again - i will certainly be getting a divorce soon as i can get out of here and find a lawyer			0

@entity35 ' *hatched* sick plot to get revenge on husband @entity36 '
she returned to flat with can of petrol after heated argument about money
' forced fuel down son 's throat then dragged towards a flame on the stove '
when his father intervened ' she spilled petrol and all three caught fire '
