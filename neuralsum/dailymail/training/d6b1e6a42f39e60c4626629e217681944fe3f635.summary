by @entity0 president @entity1 announced today that he would again go around @entity2 to enact immigration reform measures			1
in a hastily scheduled statement this afternoon from the @entity5 , @entity1 said he would ' greatly prefer ' @entity2 pass its own legislation , rather than having to take matters into his own hands , but @entity10 @entity9 have given him no choice			1
' i do n’t prefer taking administrative action , ' he said			2
' i take executive action only when we have a serious problem , a serious issue , and @entity2 chooses to do nothing			1
' the president said he had directed his administration to ' refocus ' is efforts on border security and said it would use its ' existing legal authorities ' to do ' what @entity2 refuses to do ' and fix the broken immigration system			1
it will still taken an act of @entity2 , however , @entity1 said , to truly reform the system , and @entity1 indicated that he had recently told house speaker @entity48 as much			1
' i ’m going to continue to reach out to @entity10 @entity9 in the hope that they deliver a more permanent solution with a comprehensive bill , ' @entity1 said			1
' maybe it will be after the midterms , when they ’re less worried about politics			0
maybe it will be next year			0
whenever it is , they will find me a willing partner			0
' the president said he 'd be willing to look at legislation other than the version he supports that is stalled in the @entity66			2
' the only thing i ca n’t do , ' @entity1 said , ' is stand by and do nothing while waiting for [ @entity10 @entity9 ] to get their act together			1
' ' i believe speaker @entity48 when he says he wants to pass an immigration bill			2
i think he genuinely wants to get something done , ' @entity1 said at another point in his remarks			2
after @entity1 's announcement @entity48 released a statement saying ' it is sad and disappointing ' that the president ' wo n't work with us , but is instead intent on going it alone with executive orders that ca n't and wo n't fix these problems			1
' in our conversation last week , i told the president what i have been telling him for months : the @entity85 people and their elected officials do n't trust him to enforce the law as written			0
' until that changes , it is going to be difficult to make progress on this issue , ' @entity48 said			0
president @entity1 said he expects recommendations from his administration by the end of the summer on what it can do without @entity2 ' approval the president 's announcement comes two years after he went around @entity2 to change how the administration handles deporting young people who have lived in the @entity85 since they were children			1
the president 's 2012 @entity104 executive order instructed immigration officials to stop deporting anyone under the age of 31 who had arrived in the @entity85 before the age of 16 , lived in the @entity85 continuously since 2007 and had no criminal record			1
that policy , @entity9 claim , led to the current humanitarian crisis on @entity85 's border with @entity114			2
unaccompanied minors have poured into the border since @entity104 went into effect			0
many are coming from @entity114 , but the majority are coming from @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122			0
the @entity39 agency expects 100,000 children to illegally immigrate to the @entity125 by the end of the year			0
neither @entity1 's @entity104 directive nor his immigration reform legislation that is currently stalled in the @entity66 would apply to them , but more than 200 a day are coming to the @entity85 anyway under the false assumption they will receive amnesty when they arrive			1
' they are principally motivated by a disinformation campaign that ’s being propagated by criminal syndicates that are preying on vulnerable populations of people who are living in pretty desperate situations , ' @entity10 press secretary @entity134 told reporters today			2
border enforcement officials have been overwhelmed by the flood of children , and detention facilities in the @entity147 area in @entity41 are overflowing with teens and small kids awaiting deportation or other government action			0
' the @entity10 claims it will move to return these children to their families in their home countries , yet additional executive action from this president is n't going to stem the tide of illegal crossings , it ’s only going to make them worse , ' @entity48 said today			1
@entity48 accused the president was ' giving false hope to children and their families that if they enter the country illegally they will be allowed to stay			0
' two female detainees sleep in a holding cell at the @entity167 in @entity168 , @entity169 in his remarks @entity1 said today that crisis on the border ' underscores ' the need for immigration reform and called on @entity175 saying otherwise to stop coming up with excuses not to pass reforms			1
' it makes no sense			0
it 's not on the level			0
it 's just politics , plain and simple , ' he said			0
@entity1 denied that his past actions had provided encouragement for the mass migration of children , saying , ' i 've sent a clear message to parents in these countries , not to put their kids through this			2
' ' but the problem is , is that our system is so broken , so unclear that folks do n’t know what the rules are , ' @entity1 said			1
so while i will continue to push @entity10 @entity9 to drop the excuses and act , ' the president said , ' @entity85 can not wait forever for them to act , ' which is why he directing his administration to act on its own			1
and if @entity10 @entity9 do n't like it , they should pass their own legislation instead of trying to sue him , he said			1
@entity1 was referring to @entity48 's announcement last week that the @entity10 would bring a lawsuit against the president for repeatedly going around @entity2 to amend the law as he sees fit			1
' pass a bill ; solve a problem			1
do n't just say no on something that everybody agrees needs to be done , ' the president said of @entity10 republicans			2
' with the @entity219 filing a lawsuit to curb @entity1 ’s presidential overreach , you 'd think this administration would get the message , ' @entity217 chairman @entity216 said in a statement harshly rebuking the president			2
' our constitution is not a list of suggestions			0
our founders were not mistaken when they created three separate branches of government , ' @entity216 argued , citing recent @entity233 decisions rolling back @entity235 - supported legislation			0
' [ the president ] wants a comprehensive immigration overhaul that 's his way or the highway			0
but that does n't give him the power to rewrite the @entity225 or the law			0
' @entity169 senator @entity242 , a member of the @entity244 senators leading the way for immigration reform , said @entity1 's decision to go rogue today was a poor choice			2
' we 're all frustrated that @entity250 has n't moved in the @entity10 , ' the @entity9 senator tweeted , ' but @entity251 dismissing genuine concern about unilateral executive action does n't help			1
' anxious for action on immigration reform , president @entity1 instructed his administration to stop deporting young , illegal immigrants in a june 2012 memo			1
to qualify for the president 's @entity262 program , immigrants were required to : be under the age of 31 ; in school , graduated or be a member or veteran of the armed services ; have no criminal record ; arrived in the @entity85 under the age of 16 ; and been living in the @entity85 continuously since june of 2007			0
since the president announced @entity104 , the number of young , illegal immigrants coming to the @entity85 via @entity114 has skyrocketed			0
since last october , 52,000 minors , many of whom are unaccompanied by their parents , have made the dangerous journey to the @entity85 ' southern border			0
the president 's policy does not apply to new illegal immigrants but smugglers are purposefully telling families of foreign children that it does			0
the executive branch is working with the governments of the countries where most of the children are migrating from - @entity121 , @entity120 , @entity122 and @entity114 - to correct the record , but so far their efforts have been limited to meetings , phone calls , op - eds in @entity296 language newspapers and new aid to those countries			0
the administration has taken no real action to stop the children from getting into the @entity85 and has instead encouraged children to flee to the @entity85 , republicans say , by focusing on making detention centers along the border more cozy for children held in custody			2
@entity1 has ignored calls from @entity10 speaker @entity48 and other @entity9 to send the @entity310 to the border to handle the humanitarian crisis so that @entity314 officials can focusing on shutting down the criminal networks that profit off of the child immigrants .			1

president @entity1 announced today that his administration would use its ' existing legal authorities ' to do ' what @entity2 refuses to do ' and fix the broken immigration system
@entity1 said he would ' greatly prefer ' that @entity2 pass legislation addressing the issue , but in the absence of action , he said he would take matters into his own hands
if @entity10 @entity9 want him to stop governing through executive orders , @entity1 said , they should , ' pass a bill ; solve a problem '
' i take executive action only when we have a serious problem , a serious issue , and @entity2 chooses to do nothing '
