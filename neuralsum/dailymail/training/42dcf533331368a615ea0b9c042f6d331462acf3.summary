they are one of the deadliest creatures in the water but you would n't expect them to turn on their own			2
a large alligator measuring an estimated 14ft was spotted ripping a smaller gator in half at the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10			1
the fearsome creature caught the alligator in the swamp and slammed it on to the surface of the water - at one stage flipping it vertically into the air			1
@entity27 , a 51 - year - old sheet metal worker from @entity10 said : ‘ i heard a tremendous splash and what to me sounded like squeals			1
‘ i could see the head of the alligator but i could not see what it had in its mouth			0
’ the alligator disappeared into the water with its prize firmly between its jaws and @entity27 had to wait an agonising ten minutes for it to emerge again			2
the fearsome creature caught the alligator in the swamp and slammed it on to the surface of the water no match : during the fierce fight the predator then managed to sever the 8ft gator in two he added : ‘ it began to raise and i went into continuous shooting mode			1
i still did not know at that point what he had in his mouth			0
‘ it was only until i stepped back and checked the images on the lcd screen that i saw it was another alligator			0
’ @entity27 believes the larger alligator attacked the other over territory - and it was n’t a fair fight			2
he added : ‘ this whole thing has been an awesome experience to have happened to me , i feel blessed to have witnessed this and to have documented it with photos			0
‘ i was just in the right place and the right time			0
