@entity0 , a finance executive , was diagnosed with bowel cancer after doctors diagnosed anaemia @entity4 had given blood every six months for nearly two decades			1
then two years ago , when he went to donate as usual , he was told he could n't - because his iron levels were too low			1
' it came completely out of the blue , ' says @entity0 , 58 , a financier who lives with his wife , @entity10 , and their two dogs in @entity13 , @entity14			1
' i felt very healthy			2
i sail and i cycle - i 've done the @entity18 - to - @entity19 bike ride more than 25 times			2
' at first , he was n't too concerned			2
' the nurse at the donor session said it was nothing to worry about , that i was probably a bit run - down , and i should try taking iron pills - which i did			2
' about a month later , @entity0 had a routine appointment with his gp and mentioned that his iron levels were low			2
' he was pretty reassuring - but just in case , he said he 'd measure them again , ' says @entity0 , a director of @entity34 financial planners			2
' but 36 hours later the doctor rang to say my iron levels were so low - about 35 per cent below minimum - i should n't even have the energy to stand up			2
' a lack of iron - anaemia - typically causes fatigue , weakness and shortness of breath ; it can also lead to headaches , cold hands or feet , and pale skin			1
' but i had no symptoms at all , ' says @entity0			2
his gp thought this was likely to be because he was so fit and his rigorous fitness regimen had helped his body to compensate			2
at this point the doctor suggested that bleeding from a stomach ulcer might be to blame , and sent @entity0 for tests			1
these revealed the true cause was far more sinister : a tumour in his colon			1
anaemia is often thought of as purely a woman 's problem , with about three million women affected			1
but 3 per cent of men , roughly one million , also suffer from it , according to a report last year in the @entity67			0
the danger is that - as in @entity0 's case - anaemia can be a sign of an underlying problem , but men are n't seeking help			1
' men may not realise they are at risk , and are generally more hesitant to see doctors , ' says dr @entity75 , a consultant gastroenterologist at @entity76			0
the body needs iron to produce red blood cells			0
without sufficient iron , not only are there fewer red blood cells , those that are produced lack haemoglobin , an iron - rich protein that transports oxygen around the body			0
his iron levels were so low - about a third below minimum - he should n't even have had the energy to stand the lack of oxygen affects almost every function in the body , such as the immune system - which is why frequent infections can be a warning sign			0
@entity96 is also vital for the hair , skin and nails			0
often a lack of iron can simply be down to not getting enough from the food we eat			0
it is found in many foods , including red meat , fish and dark green leafy vegetables			0
otherwise , in women the usual cause is heavy periods			0
in men , however , anaemia is typically a result of bleeding in the gastro - intestinal tract ( the stomach and intestines )			1
this can happen for many reasons , but most often it occurs when taking aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( @entity123 )			0
this is the single largest cause of gastro - intestinal blood loss in both men and women , responsible in 10 to 15 per cent of cases , according to the @entity129			0
@entity131 aspirin is taken for a number of reasons , including lowering the risk of heart disease and stroke			0
it works by interfering with platelets , the blood cells that help blood to clot			0
a side - effect of anti-clotting action is that it can result in an increased risk of gastro - intestinal bleeding			0
' @entity146 is a significant cause of bleeding , especially in older people , who may also not get enough iron because of poor diets , ' says dr @entity75			0
other nsaids work by blocking enzymes involved in pain and inflammation , but this also stops production of another type of chemical that protects the stomach lining from stomach acid			0
this means that @entity123 increase the risk of developing an ulcer - and thus of anaemia			1
as well as stomach ulcers , other causes of anaemia in men are bleeding from abnormal blood vessels ( angiodysplasia ) ; non-cancerous growths in the colon ( polyps ) ; and infection with the stomach bug @entity176			1
treatment for anaemia depends on the cause			1
anaemia is typically a result of bleeding in the gastro - intestinal tract ( the stomach and intestines ) where it is due to a chronic disease causing bleeding , such as ulcerative colitis ( an inflammatory bowel condition ) , treatment of the underlying disease should stop the bleeding and the anaemia			1
in about 5 per cent to 10 per cent of cases of gastro - intestinal bleeding , the cause is cancer in the colon or stomach			1
a fortnight after his anaemia was diagnosed , @entity0 went for tests			1
' i had an endoscope or tube and cameras stuck into my backside about two weeks after anaemia was diagnosed			1
and they found a tumour in the colon			1
they found several smaller ones , too			0
' cancers can cause bleeding because either the tumour itself bleeds or surrounding tissue bleeds as a result of damage caused by the growth			0
' i ended up having 17 inches of my large and small colons taken out , as well as lymph glands and stomach muscles , ' says @entity0			1
' the muscles went in a sort of belt - and - braces approach to make sure everything was got			0
because i was pretty healthy , i was discharged after 40 hours , rather than the expected four to five days			0
' i did not have any chemotherapy or drugs			0
bowel cancer can be cured quickly and efficiently if caught early			1
' where no underlying cause for the anaemia can be found - thought to be the case for about one in four people - iron supplements or diet changes may be effective			1
treating the problem , even when there is no apparent cause , is important because untreated anaemia can put a strain on the heart as it needs to work harder to pump more blood around to make up for the lack of oxygen in the red blood cells			2
for people who already have heart disease , this could cause angina ( chest pain as the heart is deprived of blood ) , which is a risk factor for heart attack and stroke			0
as dr @entity75 explains : ' anaemia makes the heart work harder and brings out angina , in the same way as running for a bus can bring it out			2
' the importance of diagnosing anaemia was brought home to @entity0 , who now campaigns to raise awareness of the signs of bowel cancer and has raised funds for @entity272 @entity271 with a sponsored trek to the @entity274			1
' the frightening thing is that the first sign of my bowel cancer was low iron levels , ' he says			1
' looking back , there were other tell - tale signs , ' he adds , recalling a change in stool colour ( ' pretty black ' ) and odour , ' which i discovered can be symptoms of cancer , but i did n't know at the time '			2
' had i known , i would have seen a doctor			0
but there was no apparent blood , and i felt so well			0
' if the anaemia had n't been diagnosed when it was - and it was only by chance - who knows what would have happened			1

@entity4 , 58 , from @entity14 was diagnosed with anaemia 2 years ago
a fortnight later he *underwent* tests with an endoscope and cameras
he had bowel cancer and had to have 17 inches his colon taken out
