by @entity0 published : 09:21 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 09:25 est , 7 june 2013 a gay couple is pursuing a discrimination complaint against a @entity4 bakery , saying the business refused them a wedding cake to honor their @entity9 ceremony			1
the couple are alleging the owners have a history of turning away same - sex couples			2
as more states move to legalize same - sex marriage and civil unions , the case highlights a growing tension between gay rights advocates and supporters of religious freedom			1
' we are all entitled to our religious beliefs and we fight for that			0
but someone 's personal religious beliefs do n't justify breaking the law by discriminating against others in the public sphere			0
' the attorney for @entity53 , one of the owners of @entity55 , sees it differently			0
' we do n't believe that this is a case about commerce			0
at its heart , this is a case about conscience , ' said @entity62			0
she said the matter is important because it will serve as an example for future cases across the country as more gay couples gain legal recognitions for their relationships			1
' it brings it to the forefront			0
i just do n't think that we should heighten one person 's beliefs over and above another person 's beliefs , ' she said			0
owner : @entity79 says that he believes in @entity80 and because of his religion does not wish to make cakes for same - sex couples habit : the couple say they are not the only gay couple to have had their order refused on the grounds of their sexuality the @entity4 attorney general 's office filed a formal complaint last week after the @entity39 initiated the process last year on behalf of @entity24 and @entity25			1
the case is scheduled for a hearing in september before @entity4 's @entity98			2
nationwide , 12 states now allow gay marriage , with @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 doing so this year			1
and in a year that @entity4 lawmakers approved civil unions , they also elected the first gay @entity107			1
but @entity4 's civil union law does not provide religious protections for businesses despite the urging of @entity113 lawmakers			1
democrats argued that such a provision would give businesses cover to discriminate			0
priorities : in another instance a gay couple had their order refused but when told the order was for a dog , the bakery happily agreed to proceed tensions : as more states move to legalize same - sex marriage and civil unions , the case highlights a growing tension between gay rights advocates and supporters of religious freedom @entity24 , 28 , and @entity25 , 33 , filed the discrimination complaint against @entity53 after visiting his business in suburban @entity135 last summer			1
after a few minutes looking at pictures of different cakes , the couple said @entity53 told them he would n't make one for them when he found out it was to celebrate their wedding in @entity4 after they got married in @entity9			2
@entity53 has said making a wedding cake for gay couples would violate his @entity148 religious beliefs , according to the complaint			1
' we were all very upset , but i was angry and i felt dehumanized and mortified , ' @entity24 said			0
he said he vented his frustration on @entity153 and was surprised at how ' the story ended up catching fire , ' with responses from local media and bloggers in other countries posting about it			0
' we felt that the best way to honor the support that they had given us was to follow this complaint through , ' he said			0
in the process , the @entity39 said they found out about two other gay couples who had been refused a wedding cake from the same shop			1
both have written affidavits in support of the discrimination claim			0
recent advances on gay rights only underscore @entity4 's difficult past on the issue			2
in 2006 , voters banned gay marriage			1
now what ? @entity4 law says it Â¿ s illegal to discriminate based on sexual orientation in employment and housing			1
but when it comes to things like selling cakes , the law is less than clear more notably , in 1992 , voters approved a ban on municipal antidiscrimination laws to protect gays , leading some to brand @entity4 a ' hate state			1
' four years later , the @entity37 @entity193 said the law , known as @entity195 , was unconstitutional			2
the complaint seeks to force @entity55 to ' cease and desist ' the practice of refusing wedding cakes for gay couples , and to tell the public that their business is open to everyone			2
if @entity53 loses the case and refuses to comply with the order , he would face fines of $ 500 per case and up to a year in jail , his attorney said ' it would force him to choose between his conscience and a paycheck			0
i just think that 's an intolerable choice , ' @entity214 said .			0

cake shop refused to bake a cake for gay couple *specifically* because of their sexual orientation
bakery now being taken to court for not serving gay couples
illegal under @entity4 law to discriminate on employment or housing but less clear on cake
12 @entity37 states allow gay marriage but @entity4 only allows for civil unions
