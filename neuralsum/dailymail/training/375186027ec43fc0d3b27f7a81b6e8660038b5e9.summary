@entity2 lingerie line @entity0 sparked controversy last week with its latest campaign , which has a line - up of super-skinny models next to the slogan ‘ the perfect body ’			1
does it promote an unrealistic body shape , fuelling low self - esteem and eating disorders ? probably – but it ’s just a drop in the ocean of airbrushed images of doll - like perfection that bombard us every day			1
the fact is , not even the @entity18 are born like that			1
their fashion show comes to the @entity22 next month , and models such as @entity24 and @entity25 will follow a gruelling diet and workout schedule to prepare			1
@entity30 's @entity29 models train intensely for five hours a day before catwalk shows , pictured in @entity32 they ’ve been open about the extremes they go to , dispelling any notion they just flop out of bed and into a pair of diamante knickers			1
@entity24 admitted to living on meal replacement shakes for nine days before she hits the catwalk			1
there ’s even a training camp for them in @entity46 , @entity47 , led by @entity48 , the former boxer behind the 1,000 - calorie workout			1
it involves up to five hours of exercise a day			1
no wonder these girls are known as the athletes of the modelling world			1
the fashion ‘ diet ’ of cigarettes and coffee seems to have been replaced , thankfully – but is this new version any healthier ? models such as @entity24 and @entity61 ( pictured ) follow a gruelling diet and workout regime why i 've fallen for park runs no wonder they choose this time of year for the @entity68 , which takes place today			1
i usually hate running , but the fall weather is so nice in @entity32 that i ’ve been inspired to get outside and jog around my local park			1
not only does it feel refreshing to mix up my usual routine with something different , but there are all sorts of benefits to exercising outdoors			2
you increase your workload by up to ten per cent by running outside compared to on the treadmill , and the constantly changing environment maximises the co-ordination between your muscles and your nervous system			2
as most of us are @entity86 - deficient , any activity that means more exposure to sunlight is surely a good thing			2
fuel up before hitting the gym q : i ’m always starving after exercise and find myself craving chips , chocolate and everything i know i should n’t be eating			2
do you have any tips for helping me avoid this ? a : feeling hungry right after you work out could be a sign that you ’re not fuelling up properly before you hit the gym			2
sports dietician @entity102 recommends a small carb - based snack about 45 to 60 minutes before your workout : ‘ try eating half a piece of pita bread with a teaspoon of peanut butter , or a small banana and a few nuts			2
’ you could also be mistaking thirst for hunger – especially if you ’re craving salty foods such as chips			0
if you do work out on a regular basis , you need to up your overall water intake to reflect this and could also experiment with a home - made electrolyte drink to sip in the gym – simply add a pinch of sea salt and a squeeze of fresh lime to your regular water bottle			0
before hitting the gum you should drink plenty of water and eat a small , carb - based snack , says sports dietician @entity102 drinking coconut water after your workout will also help replace the electrolytes you lose in your sweat , and satisfy your sweet tooth for very few calories , too			0
most importantly , though , you should n’t try to fight these cravings as ignoring your hunger is a sure - fire way to set yourself up for a binge later in the day			1
but instead of reaching for the nearest chocolate bar , my nutritionist @entity140 suggests seeking out natural sources of sugar and salt			0
‘ for a sweet post-workout treat , i love to have two pitted @entity148 dates stuffed with almond butter			0
and if you ’re craving something salty , how about some chickpeas roasted in coconut oil , sea salt and pepper			0
this snack is a fabulous source of protein , fat , sodium , and complex carbohydrates , ’ she says			0
taking a little more effort to have these kinds of snacks on hand after your workout is well worth the effort			0
but remember you can also time your workout so that it ’s time for one of your proper meals when you finish			0
exercising right before lunch or dinner means you can tuck in to your heart ’s content			0
you might have seen enough of pumpkins for one year , but the word in the wellness world is that pumpkin seed oil ( @entity176 ) is acquiring superfood status			0
packed with @entity178 and @entity179 , zinc , omega - 3 and 6 , fatty acids and antioxidants , @entity176 has benefits for hair , skin and diet – and it ’s showing up on menus and in beauty products everywhere			0
the juicing backlash has begun on my side of the pond , over sugar content			0
latest government guidelines recommend fewer than 25g of sugar per day , while the famous doctor @entity197 at cult outlet @entity200 contains 38g – one gram less than a can of @entity202 here			1
next big thing ? @entity205 smoothies , which are higher in fibre .			0
