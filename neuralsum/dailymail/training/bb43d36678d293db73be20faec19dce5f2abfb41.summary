the blonde star - who was recently diagnosed with @entity10 's disease - told sister @entity9 and friends @entity13 and @entity12 that she needed to take some time away from the show to concentrate on her rekindled relationship with former @entity4 star @entity16			1
but that does n't mean @entity1 's success outside of the show is going to be slowing down anytime soon - the 23 - year - old has just been snapped up by @entity20 to be the ambassador of its @entity23 range			1
@entity24 caught up with @entity1 to find out her beauty secrets , summer style tips and plans for the future - which is most certainly looking bright			1
@entity1 : @entity1 , who last night announced her departure from @entity4 , has just been unveiled as the face of @entity20 's @entity23 range so @entity24 caught up with her to chat all things beauty the blonde reality tv star is using her fake tan expertise to act as a brand ambassador and educate young girls about the dangers of sun beds			1
' i 've always used @entity20 , it 's my number one tan and my mum would buy it me for @entity42 every year , ' she said			1
' this range is targetted at a younger audience to steer them away from sunbeds			2
' i will be going around some schools in the @entity48 and teaching youngsters to look after their skin by using fake tan			0
pastures new : @entity1 confirmed wednesday night 's episode will be her last on @entity4 ' we 're thinking of going away and having some spray tan and spray champagne parties			1
instead of being a face of it , i 'm more like an ambassador and i 've always used fake tan so it 's a nice job for me to talk about			1
' while @entity1 sports a golden glow as we meet her in the @entity65 , she admits she has n't always got it right			1
' when i first started @entity4 i was rather dark , i used to ott it ! i always think you have to prep your skin , i used to whack it on and wake up streaky , ' she said			1
beauty aficionado : @entity1 , pictured with the new range , says she is a real ' girl 's girl ' and is obsessed with buying make - up after much trial and error , @entity1 says she 's finally got it right and crams her make - up bag with plenty of products to keep her looking red carpet - ready			1
opening up her make - up bag , she said : ' i am such a girl 's girl , my make - up bag is endless			2
everytime i 'm at the airport , i 'm at the @entity88 counter stocking up , it 's ridiculous really			2
' my mum always asks if i 've got enough but there 's never enough ! ' @entity1 's hero products include @entity93 brows , @entity88 eyeshadow and lipsticks , @entity97 blusher and its @entity99 bronzer , which she says is be a summer must - have			1

' i researched @entity118 and she swears by it so i bought some and i love it			2
i put it on my face and eyes before bed and wake up and my skin feels so soft			2
' while she 's keen to copy @entity118 's beauty regime , you wo n't catch @entity1 slurping on a green juice like the supermodel anytime soon			1
' @entity118 loves juices and supplements			2
in @entity138 it 's so easy to grab gluten - free food and smoothies at every corner but in @entity142 it 's not really like that , you 've got nice restaurants to indulge in and i do try but i do n't drive myself mad			2

' i 've been working with a lovely stylist called @entity174 and it 's working out so well			2

my fans love affordable fast fashion and i do as well			0
do n't get me wrong , i love my statement designer pieces like bags and shoes but i love brands like @entity189 , too			0
