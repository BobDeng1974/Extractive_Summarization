by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter @entity3 : 23:15 est , 14 december 2013 @entity4 : 12:45 est , 15 december 2013 @entity6 quarterback @entity5 won the @entity7 saturday only nine days after being cleared in a sex assault case			1
he earned college football 's most prestigious individual award despite being left completely off a substantial number of ballots - likely in response to the allegations that were made against him by a female @entity17 student			1
the charges were dropped december 5 , only a handful of days before votes for the @entity7 ballot were due			1
moving on : @entity6 quarterback @entity5 hoists the @entity7 after being named college football 's best player ' i can not explain the feeling that i have inside right now , ' mr @entity5 said			1
' i 'm so overwhelmed			0
' when his name was announced , he popped from his seat and quickly made his way to his mom and dad for hugs and kisses			0
he smiled and laughed through most of his acceptance speech , but got a little choked up when he talked about his parents			0
' so many people instilled in me , trust the process â € “ from there , know the truth , ' said mr @entity5			0
' when you see your mom and your dad and they 've been struggling through this whole process it was nice to see a smile on their faces , ' he added			0
mr @entity5 received 668 first - place votes and 2,205 points			0
he finished 1,501 points ahead of @entity57 quarterback @entity56 for the seventh - largest margin of victory in @entity7 history , despite being left off 115 of the 900 ballots that were returned			1
@entity63 quarterback @entity62 was third , followed by @entity65 's @entity64 , @entity67 's @entity66 and @entity69 's @entity68			2
mr @entity66 - who won the honor last year - was the first freshman to win the @entity7 , and was trying to join @entity72 's @entity71 as a two - time winner			1
instead , mr @entity5 made it two freshman winners in the 79 - year history of the @entity7			1
he also became the youngest winner at 23 days short of 20			2
the 19 - year - old also was investigated last month for a year - old sexual assault complaint , but no charges were filed and the case was closed four days before @entity7 votes were due			1
' people trusted me and saw us play , ' @entity5 said			0
mr @entity5 is the nation 's top - rated passer and has led the top - ranked @entity87 to a spot in the @entity90 championship game against no. 2 @entity69 on jan. 6 , his birthday			2
famous @entity93 : mr @entity5 won the award despite being left off 115 ballots he made college football look easy from his very first game			1
on @entity99 night , on national television , @entity5 completed 25 of 27 passes for 356 yards and four touchdowns in a victory at @entity103			0
it was a brilliant debut that lived up to the offseason hype , when mr @entity5 wowed @entity6 fans in the @entity87 ' spring football game and on the baseball diamond as a hard - throwing reliever and clutch - hitting outfielder			2
he had already earned the nickname @entity112 before he ever played a college football game			1
he quickly became one of the most beloved @entity87 since @entity115 , the 1993 @entity7 winner			2
mr @entity5 is the third @entity87 quarterback to win the award , along with @entity118 in 2000			0
he and @entity6 were cruising toward an undefeated season when news broke of an unresolved sexual assault complaint against him made to the @entity122 last december			2
the dormant case was handed over to the state attorney 's office for a full investigation			0
a female student at @entity6 accused @entity5 of rape			0
mr @entity5 's attorney said the sex was consensual			2
controversial winner : mr @entity5 kisses the @entity7 while posing for photographers after the award ceremony during three weeks of uncertainty , the footballer continued to play sensationally , especially in @entity6 's big games against @entity136 and @entity137 , while other contenders stumbled or failed to distinguish themselves			1
if voters were looking to mr @entity66 or mr @entity56 or mr @entity62 or mr @entity64 or even @entity142 of @entity143 to give them a good alternative , it did n't happen			0
mr @entity68 made a late surge and ended up in @entity147 because of the lack of serious challengers to mr @entity5			0
the @entity151 mission statement says : ' @entity152 annually recognizes the outstanding college football player whose performance best exhibits the pursuit of excellence with integrity			1
' it 's a statement that has put the @entity7 in awkward situations before			1
in 2010 , @entity160 played the season under the cloud of an @entity164 investigation			0
he had also had legal troubles while in college			0
but like mr @entity5 , there was no doubt he was the best player and he won the award			1
before last season , mr @entity66 was arrested after being involved in a fight and providing police fake @entity173			0
it did n't stop @entity66 from winning the @entity7			2
@entity175 , the 1972 winner from @entity176 , pleaded guilty to a felony after helping to hold up a gas station as a freshman in 1970			0
he was pardoned earlier this year			0
@entity180 had his 2005 @entity7 stripped after the @entity164 determined he had violated its rules during that season			1
but the @entity7 trust did not ask @entity184 and @entity185 to return their heismans after serving jail time			2
no contest : despite his off - field issues , mr @entity5 was a cut above the rest of the @entity7 candidates the accusations against mr @entity5 were serious and documents released by the police with the accuser 's allegations were not flattering to him			1
it probably explains why so many voters left him out of their top three			1
last year mr @entity66 appeared on 92 percent of the ballots			0
mr @entity5 appeared on 87 percent this year			0
there was no doubting his on - the - field credentials			0
@entity5 is on pace ( 190.1 ) to break @entity207 's record for best passer efficiency rating in a season and set @entity211 freshman records for yards passing ( 3,820 ) and touchdown passes ( 38 )			2
@entity6 's average margin of victory is 42 points , and the star quarterback has spent most of the @entity87 ' fourth quarters resting			1
the investigation has taken some of the shine off mr @entity5 's @entity7 coronation , at least for some			1
but if the question is simply who was college football 's best player in 2013 , @entity112 was the clear answer .			1

the star player won the award as college football 's best player during the 2013 season
he was cleared from sex assault allegations only four days before @entity7 ballots were due
voters left him off a significant number of ballots , but he still won by a historic margin
