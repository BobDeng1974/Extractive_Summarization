by @entity0 published : 12:27 est , 4 july 2013 updated : 12:27 est , 4 july 2013 a plastic surgeon has launched a brand of lingerie designed especially for women with mastectomies			1
so far , @entity7 - based dr @entity6 , who had reconstructive surgery herself after a lymphoma diagnosis at 13 , has released two intimate sleepwear bras and one bikini top for @entity12			1
the items are designed to accommodate various weights of prosthetics , scarring and other issues associated with mastectomies			0
bras for a cause : @entity7 - based plastic surgeon @entity20 has launched @entity12 , a lingerie brand for women who have had mastectomies or reconstructive surgery ' i hope that one of my bikini designs will be featured in @entity29 and be worn by a model that has had a mastectomy , ' she told @entity32 , adding : ' she can be every bit as sexy as the next woman			1
' earlier this year , a @entity36 petition was launched petitioning @entity37 to design a similar line of lingerie for women who have had mastectomies			2
despite the petition amassing over 120,000 signatures , in the end the brand opted not to go through with the line , claiming that the creation of mastectomy bras is ' complicated and truly a science '			2
but dr @entity6 said that she does n't understand why @entity37 opted out of the opportunity , especially since it would have involved just a slight tweak to the designs they already have			0
' i do n't think brands have a responsibility to help women with mastectomies , but i would think they 'd want to ' ' [ @entity37 's ] statement does not make any sense to me , ' she said			0
' they have the funding , facilities , designers and consultants to produce anything they want to produce			0
' she added that the brand 's @entity69 lace bralette is ' three quarters of the way there ' anyway			0
@entity12 lingerie , which costs $ 85 an item , is made from an elastic fabric which helps accommodate for different weights of prosthetics			1
inspiration : dr @entity6 has used her own expertise as a plastic surgeon , as well as her experience having had reconstructive surgery after a lymphoma diagnosis at the age of 13 special design : @entity12 lingerie , which costs $ 85 an item , is made from an elastic fabric which helps accommodate for the different weights of prosthetics the bras and bikini also feature an adjustable bust , so that women with scars can choose how much or how little cleavage they want to show			1
' the line was designed to allow woman to reveal more if they wanted to , ' says the @entity12 website			1
' a woman with a mastectomy can be every bit as sexy as the next woman ' ' after all , our breasts may be altered but the rest of our body is the same as every other woman			0
' the bras are also aimed at women who have uneven breasts - either from birth or from surgery			1
while she is baffled by @entity37 's decision not to launch a collection for women with mastectomies , dr @entity6 says she is happy to step in			2
' i do not think mass brands have a responsibility to help fill the needs of women with mastectomies , ' she said			0
' [ but ] i would think they would want to			0

@entity7 - based dr @entity125 used her expertise as a plastic surgeon to launch @entity12 lingerie
she also has *undergone* a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery herself , after being diagnosed with lymphoma at 13
