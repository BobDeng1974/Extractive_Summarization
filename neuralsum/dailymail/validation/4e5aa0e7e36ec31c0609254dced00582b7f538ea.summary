it would be lovely to think that @entity1 will wake up soon to be told of the compassion and humility shown by a growing army of football supporters			1
at the time of writing he is in a coma , fighting for his life after being ambushed by a group of @entity12 fans as he made his way to the railway station after @entity16 's 2 - 2 draw at @entity17 on saturday			1
a group of @entity12 supporters were so ashamed of the incident that they set up a website , a page dedicated to raising money to pay for @entity26 's travel and tickets to future matches			1
@entity16 fan @entity1 ( left ) is currently in a coma after being ambushed by a group of @entity12 fans as he made his way to the station following the 2 - 2 draw in the @entity35 ( right ) at @entity17 on saturday over £ 22,000 has been raised for @entity1 via a football fund set up by group of @entity12 supporters @entity16 fan @entity1 lies on the ground as he is attacked following his side 's draw with @entity12 @entity26 is currently in an induced coma and fighting for his life in hospital @entity1 was heading to @entity46 train station when he was subjected to an ' unprovoked attack ' the initial target was £ 1,000 but by tuesday evening 1,672 people had raised £ 22,089			1
@entity50 can respond in the most remarkable ways , but these supporters know that society 's fragile truce with the game ended when this vicious and unprovoked attack took place			2
we have a tendency to move on so quickly , to switch on the television set , to sit down to watch @entity61 against @entity62 and then look forward to a mouth - watering @entity64 tie between @entity66 and @entity67			2
always looking forward , leaving the bad bits of the weekend behind and hoping for a better result for our team on saturday			0
nothing wrong with that , nothing at all			0
but sometimes we must pause for thought , to return to the scene of the crime for a few salutary moments and think about this poor guy in a hospital bed , fighting for his life			0
to wonder what it must be like for a family member to receive a call from the police telling them that their husband , their dad , their son , is lying in a hospital , in a coma , may never wake up			0
@entity26 was making his way to the train station after the 2 - 2 draw between the sides at @entity17 ( pictured ) @entity95 ( left ) stretches out top convert the equaliser for @entity16 who took a point in a 2 - 2 draw @entity95 celebrates after his goal prevented rivals @entity12 from taking all three points in the promotion race or to consider his friends , the people who witnessed this horrific attack as they made their way through that intimidating underpass near the stadium and headed for the railway station			1
or the innocent bystanders , the people who are frozen in time when these injudicious attacks take place			1
they , too , will be traumatised			0
then there are the perpetrators , the thugs who are responsible for this attack			0
are they proud men today , or hiding like cowards ? @entity26 is a football fan like me or you , following his team - @entity16 , in this case - around the country on a saturday afternoon			1
there is a rising tide in the sport , the ' @entity126 - some ? ' culture creating waves again after more raw footage emerged from @entity132 last weekend			1
what is the motivation for this ? please do n't say a 5.30pm kick - off meaning lads full of ale , because that is no excuse either			0
we can not put a news value on someone 's existence either , just because the team @entity26 follows do not play to the bells and whistles of the @entity147 each weekend			2
this is someone 's life and we have a moral obligation to address these perplexing issues			0
@entity153 fans storm on to the @entity132 pitch after their 2 - 0 win against @entity156 in the @entity64 the 5.30pm kick - off in the @entity159 derby on saturday was no excuse for the behaviour of the fans @entity163 are making some progress in the hunt for the thugs who did this and an appeal for witnesses was retweeted 82 times over the past few days			1
there is a desire to do more , to create an environment where tribal passion is not overwhelmed by people , however small their number , throwing punches , even in isolated incidents			0
for @entity26 and his friends , who were among the 2,239 @entity16 supporters who made the trip to @entity12 , the game was a real nail - biter			1
leaving the ground they would have been pleased to get a point			0
the @entity16 great @entity189 , a long - serving player and former manager at @entity191 , is now manager of @entity12			2
he remains a popular figure with their fans			0
towards the end of a riveting 2 - 2 draw , @entity12 defender @entity195 was sent off when @entity16 substitute @entity198 went down clutching his face			1
that incident is not to be interpreted as a causal link because nothing that happened on a football pitch can ever justify what happened next			0
@entity12 boss @entity189 is a former @entity16 player and manager and remains a popular figure with fans @entity195 was sent off after @entity198 went down clutching his face following an altercation to think @entity26 's day ended with his family being informed that he is in a coma takes us into unforgiving territory			1
this is the unacceptable face of the game , a severe reminder that the sport must meet the needs of the supporters inside and outside stadiums			0
according to @entity222 statistics there were only 2,273 football - related arrests last year , which includes all four divisions , plus @entity226 competitions and internationals			1
it is the lowest since records began			0
last season 33 million people attended matches and less than 0.01 per cent of those in attendance were arrested			1
the numbers look good on paper , but the @entity222 also makes it clear that the police do not always have the manpower to make arrests			2
if 5,000 fans stormed the pitch at @entity132 - theoretically every one of them should be arrested and banned fans charge towards @entity242 and his team - mates after his goal against @entity156 on saturday for example , let 's say around 5,000 @entity153 supporters invaded the pitch at the end of their 2 - 0 victory over @entity156 in the @entity64 quarter - final on saturday			1
theoretically , every one of them could be arrested and banned from @entity132 for life			2
it will never happen , which is why those @entity222 statistics can easily be distorted			2
there is certainly some grim reading in the @entity159 at the moment , with the police force making further appeals on monday to jog the memory of anyone who witnessed the incident in @entity46			0
wrong place , wrong time ? do n't give me that			0
the police force made further appeals for witnesses on monday ( pictured - a post on @entity26 ' funding page )			2

@entity1 is fighting for his life after ambush by a group of @entity12 fans
website set up by @entity12 supporters , dedicated to raising money to pay for @entity26 ' travel and tickets to future matches has reached £ 22,000
@entity16 fan was *walking* to station after 2 - 2 draw at @entity17 on saturday
family , friends , and innocent bystanders will all be traumatised
' @entity126 - some ' culture is a rising tide in the sport - as @entity132 pitch *invasion* in last weekend 's @entity64 quarter - final proved
according to figures included in @entity222 statistics there were only 2,273 football - related arrests last year
*33m* people attended matches last season and less than 0.01 per cent of those in attendance were arrested
