by @entity0 the reality of jet - powered travel grows ever closer - and now a @entity5 - based company has demonstrated its small jet - pack inside a large government building packed with spectators			1
the ‘ @entity11 ’ has a maximum speed of 77mph ( 124km/h ) and can reach heights of 250ft ( 76 metres )			1
and unlike other jet - packs , this one is small and does not need a large frame , wings or a pressurised jets of water to allow pilots to fly			2
the ' @entity11 ' has a maximum speed of 77mph ( 124km/h ) and can reach heights of 250ft ( 76metres ) it is fuelled by a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and nitrogen			1
the nitrogen provides a ‘ push ’ for the hydrogen peroxide through the motor , which converts it to high temperature and high pressure steam inside rocket nozzles that allows the machine to fly			0
the jet - pack provides 300lbs of thrust or 800 horsepower for 33 seconds , but in the future , pilots may be able to embark upon longer trips using the technology			1
currently they can only cover distance of up to 2,500ft ( 760metres )			0
the ' @entity11 ' may not be a sleek as @entity49 's ( pictured ) but it allows people to fly after 100 hours of lessons , much like the fictional super hero			2
unlike other jet - packs , this one is small and does not need a large frame , wings or a water spout to allow pilots to fly the jet - pack provides 300lbs of thrust or 800 horsepower for 33 seconds , but in the future , pilots may be able to embark upon longer trips using the technology while the fuel is non-explosive and non-flammable , the jet - pack still dangerous compared to other modes of transport and requires at least 100 hours of training to operate it			1
the vehicle is currently not available commercially			0
the demonstration of the jet - pack , which its makers claim is a ‘ green eco-friendly machine , ’ took place in @entity73 at @entity75 's future is here festival which was hosted at the @entity77 and international trade center			2
it was driven by performance pilot @entity80 , who works for the firm behind the technology			0
@entity83 built the machine based upon an old model developed built by @entity86 in the 1960s , but made it lighter , faster , long - flying and economical			0
it claims to be building the ‘ world ’s most advanced personal flying machines			0
another jet - pack designed and piloted by @entity94 inventor @entity93 uses jet engines for propulsion			2
up and away ! the jet - pack ( pictured ) is fuelled by a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and nitrogen			2
the nitrogen provides a ' push ' for the hydrogen peroxide through the motor , which converts it to high temperature and high pressure steam inside rocket nozzles that allows the machine to fly free as a bird : @entity93 's amazing jet wing , pictured , blurs the line between a plane and a jetpack and while it can not take off vertically , it uses jet engines its wings offer stability while it is easily manoeuvrable , the pack features a cumbersome carbon fibre wing , measuring just over 6.6ft ( 2.2m ) across			0
because of its frame , the @entity94 jet - pack also has to be deployed from a helicopter and can not take off from the ground			0
the @entity125 jet - pack , however , can take off vertically and is possibly the most similar in appearance to the ‘ @entity11 ’ jet - pack , despite being quite a bit larger			1
it relies on twin - ducted fans to generate lift			0
the petrol - powered jet - pack is less environmentally friendly than @entity83 ’s but can travel much further – up to 19miles ( 30km ) on a single tank of fuel			1
the @entity125 model has a top speed of 46mph ( 74km ) and can stay airborne for half an hour			0

@entity83 in @entity145 , @entity5 , demonstrated the technology inside the @entity148 building and @entity149
the ' @entity11 ' has a top speed of 77mph ( 124km/h ) and can reach heights of 250ft ( 76 metres )
it is smaller , faster and greener than other *prototype* jet - packs but can only remain airborne for 33 seconds
over 100 hours of lessons are needed to fly the jet - pack , which is currently not commercially available
