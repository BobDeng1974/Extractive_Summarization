@entity0 feels he now has a responsibility to help @entity2 mature into a full @entity3 international after he finally committed his future to @entity6			1
the 21 - year - old put an end to speculation that he could be set to quit the @entity10 in the summer after signing a new deal until 2019 earlier this week			1
@entity2 was just 18 when he joined the @entity6 in an £ 8million move from @entity13			1
but only this season has he won a regular starting place and spent much of last year on loan in the @entity17 before returning to score the goals which kept the club in the @entity20			2
@entity2 has signed a new contract to keep him at the @entity10 until 2019 @entity6 boss @entity0 believes the striker can progress to the senior @entity3 side the @entity6 striker has won 17 caps for @entity3 's under 21 side without moving up to the seniors @entity0 regrets not spending more time with the forward upon his arrival on @entity31 just over a year ago			1
but the @entity32 believes that @entity2 ’s new contract gives them both a platform from which to move forward			1
‘ it 's important for me that @entity2 's signed his contract			1
too many things have been out in the open , ’ he said ahead of saturday 's visit of @entity37			2
‘ in the summer it was the aim to get him tied down but things happen			0
decisions are not easy and everything needed to come together - him being happy , wanting to be here and being part of the team			1
‘ to be honest , not having a chat with him when i arrived was something i did n't do that i regret			0
‘ i 'm delighted ( now ) because it 's not easy to find players like @entity2 - and you never know how much he can cost			1
we can talk different prices but for sure we 're talking about millions			0
’ the 21 - year - old opens the scoring against champions @entity60 earlier this season @entity2 fires in a shot during the goalless draw with @entity63 in december @entity2 has been capped 17 times by @entity65 and @entity0 believes progression to the senior ranks should now be his aim			1
‘ there are not too many young @entity71 players with that power , ’ he said			0
‘ maybe the people who worked with him at @entity74 would be surprised if they got the chance to see him again now			0
‘ they 'd be surprised at how much he 's improved and how mature he is			2
now it depends on us making him better and him scoring goals			0
’ he added : ‘ i forget sometimes he 's 21			2
because you 've been with him for a while , you think he 's 24			2
he 's more mature , he knows his game better and what he can do for us			0
he keeps improving and there 's more to come , i 'm sure there 's more			0
’ @entity2 was named @entity87 before his move to @entity6			1
@entity0 , though , feels the big - money transfer came too soon in his development			1
‘ i 'm not going to blame anyone , but sometimes when you pay a lot of money for a player , we all think that player 's ready , it does n't matter if he 's 18 or 28 , ’ he said			0
‘ unfortunately , or fortunately , there 's always room for improvement , so maybe he did n't finish his football education in that natural way			0
@entity2 's goals towards the end of last season kept the @entity31 club in the @entity20 @entity2 's big money move from @entity13 possibly came too early , suggests @entity0 ‘ when you saw him at @entity13 at that age and you sign him for that money , naturally everyone thinks he has to play immediately			1
‘ he found himself in and out and coming back to the club with different managers and never in a position to play			0
‘ but it 's been good for him so far ( this season ) , he feels part of the team which is important and he 's playing at the highest level , which is what he was looking for			2
you need to play against the very best to get better			0
