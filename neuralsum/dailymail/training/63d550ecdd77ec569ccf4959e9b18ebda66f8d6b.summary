by @entity0 published : 17:28 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 07:29 est , 26 june 2012 the flawed computer programme that led to a week of chaos for millions of @entity5 customers was being supervised by an it support team in @entity7 , it was revealed last night			1
last february , @entity5 advertised for a series of key jobs , paying between £ 9,000 and £ 11,000 a year , in the @entity7 city of @entity11			1
that is way below what an equivalent worker would be paid in @entity15			2
the banking giant was urgently seeking computer graduates with several years ' experience of using @entity19 , the programme which the bank uses to run its vast network of transactions and accounts			0
no link : @entity11 , @entity7 , where @entity26 parent @entity5 employs it support staff on a yearly wage of between £ 9,000 and £ 11,000 the job advertisement said : ‘ looking for candidates having 4 - 7 years of experience in @entity32 using ca - 7 tool			1
’ but last night technology website @entity36 claimed that this software needed to be updated and overseen from @entity7 by staff who are employed to work around the clock to solve any faults			1
but the fiasco has brought calls for the bank 's bosses to be subject to a ' detailed investigation ' from @entity47 governor sir @entity46 said today			1
he said there need to be answers as to what went wrong and why it has taken so long to sort the issues out			0
his comments came as @entity55 said it was finally getting on top of the crisis after it successfully updated all but 1 per cent of @entity26 and @entity5 account balances overnight			1
@entity5 has had less success sorting out the delays experienced by @entity63 customers , but it hopes to restore a full service for the start of next week			2
@entity5 has been swift to deny that its controversial job out - sourcing programme has been responsible for the fiasco			1
it merely says that the ‘ software error occurred on a @entity15 - based piece of software ’ but has declined to say where the staff overseeing the software are based			1
it is a fact that the vast computer servers are based in @entity15			2
but insiders confirmed last night that many of their support team are based in @entity7			1
useless : a woman passes an out of order @entity26 cashpoint in the town of @entity83 , @entity84			2
the it fiasco at the bank has now entered its seventh day , with many customers still unable to access their cash since being rescued by the taxpayer @entity5 has shed about 30,000 jobs , including more than 20,000 @entity15 - based roles , and has outsourced work abroad			1
some of its it support teams are now said to be based in @entity7 , even though the under - fire banking group ’s headquarters remain in @entity97			1
the buck stops here ? @entity5 chief administrative officer @entity99 is the executive directly responsible for the bank 's it systems the unite union questioned whether the ‘ off - shoring ’ job cuts had left the bank unable to cope after the software failure			1
last night insiders said problems began on tuesday night when @entity19 was updated			0
on a normal evening , this should allow all the cashpoint withdrawals , salary transfers and direct debits to be updated			0
the nightly update is the reason why internet banking transactions made by so many customers are not updated if they are made after a certain time of the day			0
but what appears to have happened is that crucial files were deleted			0
the error was spotted but – incredibly – was repeated on wednesday and again on thursday			0
it was only on friday morning that staff realised the full scale of the crisis			2
urgent calls to @entity7 followed and troubleshooters were drafted in			2
the problem was that every single transaction that was waiting in the queue had to be reprocessed in strict order of arrival , causing further delays over last weekend			0
@entity5 has consistently denied that the decision to relocate jobs to @entity7 has made any difference to its handling of the situation			1
but critics said that if the number of @entity15 - based support staff had been run down , it would always run the risk of problems if there was a major fault			1
last night @entity144 , which owns @entity19 , declined to comment on what had caused the problem			0
the fiasco is believed to be the longest and most widespread problem of its kind since the advent of computer banking			0
which ? said it raised questions about how robust systems were at other banks			0
@entity15 ’s major banks have all faced criticism that they are reliant on constantly grafting software updates on to their complex computer systems rather than replacing the systems themselves			2
@entity162 , the editor of @entity164 magazine , told @entity165 : ‘ what should have been a minor glitch has led to a pretty disastrous cock - up			0
’ he questioned why a back - up system did not appear to have been in place to protect the bank against a software failure			0
the executive directly responsible for the bank ’s it systems is chief administrative officer @entity99			0
his pay and bonus are not disclosed because he does not sit on the main board , but he is understood to receive a six - figure package .			0

@entity26 has shed 30,000 jobs since taxpayer rescue in 2007 , including 20,000 @entity15 positions , and has outsourced work overseas
insiders say many of the bank 's support teams are now based in @entity7 , where they earn between £ 9,000 and £ 11,000 a year
bank staff union @entity192 questions whether ' off - shoring ' job cuts have left @entity26 unable to cope with the current crisis
