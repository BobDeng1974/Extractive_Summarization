@entity0 ! while this sentence might puzzle many , fans of the hit @entity4 show @entity6 , the fifth season of which had its @entity9 premiere last night , will understand the reference			1
@entity0 is the brawny , simple - minded stableboy of the @entity12 family in @entity13			2
his defining characteristic , of course , is that he only speaks a single word : ' @entity0			1
' @entity0 , a character in @entity6 , earned his name because he says only the word ' @entity0 ' over and over again			1
he may have expressive aphasia , according to @entity20 , of @entity21 but those who read the @entity24 book series by @entity25 may know something that the tv fans do n't : his name is n't actually @entity0			1
according to his great - grandmother @entity29 , his real name is @entity31			0
' no one knew where ' @entity0 ' had come from , ' she says , ' but when he started saying it , they started calling him by it			2
it was the only word he had			0
' whether he intended it or not , @entity25 created a character who is a textbook example of someone with a neurological condition called expressive aphasia			1
losing the ability to speak in 1861 , @entity47 physician @entity46 was introduced to a man named @entity50 - @entity49			0
while his comprehension and mental functioning remained relatively normal , mr @entity49 progressively lost the ability to produce meaningful speech over a period of 20 years			0
like @entity0 , the man was nicknamed @entity57 because he only spoke a single word : ' @entity57			1
' just a few days after meeting dr @entity46 , @entity49 passed away			0
dr @entity46 's autopsy determined tissue damage , or a ' lesion ' , in the frontal lobe of mr @entity49 's left brain hemisphere , just next to a brain fold called the lateral sulcus			2
in 1861 , a @entity47 physician called dr @entity46 found a particular part of the brain is involved in language			2
it became known as @entity46 's area ( pictured in red )			0
damage to @entity46 's area causes language problems over the next two years , dr @entity46 acquired brains from 12 more patients with mr @entity49 's symptoms – all of the autopsy evidence was strikingly consistent			0
neuroscientists are still examining this small region of the brain , now often referred to as ' @entity84 ' to work out its many functions			0
most research has focused on a patient 's inability to form syntactically complex sentences when this area is damaged			0
more recent work using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity93 ) has also reported that @entity46 's area is active during language comprehension tasks , interpretation of movement and comprehending various gestures also associated with speech , such as waving goodbye			0
how brain damage affects speech in collaboration with @entity47 scientists in 2007 , a group at the @entity101 revisited the brains of mr @entity49 and mr @entity105 ( another of mr @entity46 's patients who could only speak five words ) using mri scans			2
one of their most interesting findings was that their lesions extended much deeper than @entity46 had reported , suggesting that multiple brain regions were probably contributing to their speech deficits			2
this evidence of widespread damage is unsurprising			0
mr @entity49 , mr @entity105 – and even @entity0 – are actually more extreme examples of individuals with expressive aphasia			1
the new series of @entity6 , featuring @entity0 , played by @entity122 , aired yesterday more commonly , a person with the disorder will express themselves in ' telegraphic speech ' , which usually comprises three or so words , including a noun and a verb			1
for example , someone may say , ' @entity133 , dog , walk ' to mean ' i walked the dog with @entity133 today			0
' the most common cause of expressive aphasia is stroke , which occurs when a blood clot blocks a vessel in the brain , resulting in tissue damage due to lack of oxygen			1
it 's estimated that expressive aphasia occurs in 12 per cent of stroke patients , while roughly 35 per cent of stroke patients suffer from a language aphasia of some form			1
expressive aphasia can also be caused by a tumour , haemorrhage , a haematoma in the membrane covering of the brain , or trauma to the head			1
it has been reported that mr @entity49 suffered from epileptic seizures as a child – some have speculated that he may have experienced head trauma during one such episode			0
so what 's @entity0 's story ? did he sustain a blow to the head , suffer a stroke , or was he simply a giant baby dropped by his mother ? he may only speak one word , but like the other characters in the show , @entity0 too may have a quite an interesting backstory .			1

@entity0 is a character in @entity6 who only speaks a single word
expert says he may have the neurological condition expressive aphasia
this is where there is a lesion in the part of the brain that controls speech
condition usually caused by a blow to the head , stroke or a tumour
