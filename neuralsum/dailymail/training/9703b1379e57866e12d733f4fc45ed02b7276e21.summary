it is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words			0
and an exhibition designed to show the beauty of data demonstrates that some of the most important scientific theories , from evolution to genetics can be summed up in diagrams and charts			1
from an early representation of an ordered universe in @entity18 ’s @entity17 work ‘ @entity19 ’ to a rainbow of circles showing the generic similarities between humans and animals , the ‘ beautiful science ’ exhibition at the @entity13 explores the work of scientists and statisticians through the ages			1
as striking as a @entity32 painting , this beautiful @entity30 map visualises the flow of ocean surface currents around the world during the period from 2005 to 2007			1
today 's scientists have access to data collected by satellites and monitoring stations and the supercomputing power to analyse and render it usefully it is organised into three themes – public health , weather and evolution			1
in the 19th century scientists were obsessed with finding out about the spread of disease and infection			2
@entity54 ’s seminal diagram demonstrated that far more soldiers perished due to preventable epidemic than died from wounds inflicted on the battlefield during the @entity59			0
the famous nurse was also a keen statistician who understood the power of conveying her ideas about preventing the spread of disease visually and her work resulted in a drop in deaths from preventable diseases in 1858			0
@entity68 , a friend of @entity54 , also has an intriguing diagram made up of circles on show at the exhibition , showing the cholera deaths between 1840 and 1850			1
this map by @entity75 in 1675 represents early attempts to produce semi-scientific illustrations of the ebb and flow of the ocean currents as understood at the time from mariner 's and explorers ' observations he plotted cycles of temperature and deaths from the disease as he ( wrongly ) believed that cholera was spread by miasma or ‘ bad air ’ but said the circles and use of colours make ‘ the diagram represent the facts in a striking manner to the eye , ’ and later set up the first national system for collecting vital statistics			0
a collection of maps and charts prove that people have always been fascinated by the weather			1
an unusual map by @entity75 in 1675 , represents early attempts to produce semi-scientific illustrations of the ebb and flow of the ocean currents as understood at the time from mariner and explorers ’ observations			0
a later map from 1863 shows the tropical and polar air currents over the @entity114 and was created by the captain of @entity117 ’s @entity116			1
@entity54 's diagram of the causes of mortality in the @entity121 from 1858			0
in this diagram , she demonstrates that far more soldiers perished due to preventable ' zymotic ' ( epidemic ) diseases ( shown in blue ) than died from wounds inflicted on the battlefield ( red ) or other causes ( black ) during the @entity59 @entity130 , who is thought of as the grandfather of the modern weather service , was concerned about the weather as he had survived many storms as a mariner and became the first weather forecaster to use wind and temperature data to predict storms			2
modern maps showing weather patterns sit alongside early interpretations in the exhibition and one animation by @entity30 visualises the flow of ocean surface currents around the world between 2005 and 2007 – and bears some resemblance to a @entity32 painting			1
today ’s scientists have access to mass amounts of data collected by satellites and monitoring stations and the supercomputing power to analyse and render it usefully			2
displaying this flow data visually allows scientists and the public to better understand how ocean circulation impacts weather around the globe			1
here are two of the @entity164 of @entity165 , which use colourful to circles to compare the human genome with that of certain animals , such as monkeys and dogs , pictured left and right this famous diagram - the only illustration in on the @entity174 - depicts the diversification of life from one or more common ancestors			0
the letters across the bottom of the diagram represent potential species , which gradually evolve into new species , some of which survive and others which go extinct another modern creation is a chart by showing social media weather sentiment and visualises daily temperature , precipitation , wind , and sunshine levels in a rainbow of colour			2
a large section of the exhibition is dedicated to the theory of evolution , which has itself evolved over the years			1
a beautiful representation of ‘ the @entity19 ’ created by @entity17 alchemist @entity18 in 1617 shows the @entity200 concept that classifies life on earth into a hierarchical order with respect to the rest of the universe			2
in this diagram @entity68 plotted cycles of temperature and deaths from @entity211 as he ( wrongly ) believed that the disease was spread by miasma or ' bad air ' but said the circles and use of colours make ' the diagram represent the facts in a striking manner to the eye ' a great ladder links @entity223 and other divine beings to astronomical bodies , man , animals , plants and minerals			0
each animal is fixed on a rung in order of perfection ( upwards towards man ) , providing a hierarchical organisation of life that laid the groundwork for the development of taxonomies and ultimately evolutionary trees			0
@entity117 ’s famous diagram – the only one from his book on the @entity174 – is also no show and depicts the diversification of life from one or more common ancestors			1
a map from 1863 shows the tropical and polar air currents over the @entity114 and was created by the captain of @entity117 's @entity116			1
@entity130 is thought of as the grandfather of the modern weather service and became the first weather forecaster to use wind and temperature data to predict storms this weather chart visualises daily temperature , precipitation , wind , and sunshine levels over the course of a year using social network data			2
it also compares 714,843 sentiment - analysed online messages captured about the weather throughout 2011			2
the size of the grey bubbles indicates the amount of messages remarking about the weather @entity269 , who was inspired by @entity117 , used evolutionary ideas to create elaborate tree diagrams organising all life on @entity273 and the genealogical history of man			1
the trunk of the tree in his diagram ‘ on the @entity279 ’ represents the ancestral history of man , as his ancestors moved through various stages , such as primitive worms , amphibians and apes			0
this tree reflects @entity269 ’s belief that evolution was a process of perfecting and that man represented the pinnacle of evolution			0
modern charts show scientists ’ continuing interest to unravel the mysteries of life and evolution			1
brightly coloured @entity164 diagrams compare the human genome with four other animals , while a molecular ‘ tree of life ’ that is also circular in shape , shows the changing global diversity of birds over space and time			2
@entity18 's @entity19 ( 1617 ) classifies life on earth into a hierarchical order with respect to the rest of the universe			0
a great ladder links @entity223 and other divine beings to astronomical bodies , man , animals , plants and minerals			0
each animal is fixed on a rung in order of perfection ( upwards towards man )			0
from the goddess @entity329 , the chain extends down to animals , plants and minerals the exhibition , which is on display at @entity336 at the @entity13 , until 26 may , shows the challenge of presenting big data in interesting ways is nothing new and shows how scientific and technological breakthroughs have allowed us to visually interpret masses of information			1
dr @entity345 , lead curator of @entity346 , said : ‘ the @entity13 is home to the nation ’s science collection and we ’re thrilled to be opening up our fantastic collections in the @entity13 ’s first science exhibition			1
‘ as big data is becoming a topic of such huge interest , we particularly wanted to show the important connections between the past and the present			2
data that is centuries old from collections like ours is now being used to inform cutting edge science			0
’ this is the @entity362 , which was published in @entity363			0
the @entity365 tree shows the changing global diversity of birds over space and time			0
it shows that since millions years ago , birds have undergone considerable diversification @entity269 , who was inspired by @entity117 , used evolutionary ideas to create elaborate tree diagrams organising all life on @entity273 and the genealogical history of man			1
the trunk of the tree in his diagram ' on the @entity279 ' represents the ancestral history of man , as his ancestors moved through various stages , such as primitive worms , amphibians and apes			0
