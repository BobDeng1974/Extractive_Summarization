death rates in @entity3 hospitals are among the highest in the western world , shock figures revealed yesterday			1
@entity6 patients were found to be almost 50 per cent more likely to die from poor care than those in @entity9			1
they have five times the chance of dying from pneumonia and twice the chance of being killed by blood poisoning			1
experts say that , despite recent improvements , @entity3 death rates still outstrip those in many other @entity18 countries			1
@entity6 patients were found to be almost 50 per cent more likely to die from poor care than those in @entity9			1
pictured is a tribute wall in memory of patients who have died at @entity25 figures obtained by professor @entity27 , in an exclusive report for @entity29 , show that the death rates in @entity31 hospitals last year were 45 per cent higher than in @entity9			1
sir @entity27 , a globally - recognised expert on hospital performance , also calculated that in 2004 death rates for hospitals in @entity31 were 22.5 per cent higher than in six others in the western world including @entity37 and @entity38			1
the latest figures are not yet available although professor @entity27 suspects death rates in @entity31 have fallen because care has substantially improved			1
‘ what i found was that the adjusted death rate in @entity31 was about 22 per cent higher than for the average of all the seven countries that i looked at and it was about 58 per cent higher than the best of the countries , ’ he said			1
an investigation was launched following concerns about high death rates and poor care at the hospital run by @entity54 ‘ i expected us to do well and was very surprised we did n’t do well – but there is no means of denying the results as they are absolutely clear			1
’ ‘ we should take notice of it and say there is a problem in the provision of health care in @entity31			2
’ earlier this year a report warned that hundreds of patients had died needlessly due to poor care at @entity54			2
but this was not an isolated case and a subsequent review led by the sir @entity70 , medical director of the @entity3 , found that thousands of patients had died unnecessarily at 14 other trusts through neglect			2
ministers have since put 11 of these trusts into special measures including @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 and @entity82			0
hit squads have been sent in to make urgent improvements			0
yesterday sir @entity70 said he would be holding urgent discussions with other officials about the data			0
‘ i want our @entity3 to be based on evidence			2
i do n’t want to disregard stuff that might be inconvenient or embarrassing , ’ he said			0
‘ i want to use this kind of data to help inform how we can improve our @entity3			2
‘ so what we need to do as clinical professionals in our @entity3 is concentrate on how we can improve that and i will be the first to bring this data to the attention of clinical leaders in this country to see how we can tackle this problem			2
‘ the fact is we have a health service that is admired around the world , founded on the cradle to grave principle			0
but the other fact is we still have too many patients dying in our hospitals when their relatives were expecting them to come home			0
’ health secretary @entity113 said : ‘ this government has shone an unprecedented spotlight on poor care through the @entity70 review of 14 hospitals with persistently high rates , and taken tough action to tackle these problems by placing 11 hospitals in special measures			2
‘ sadly , warnings about high death rates were ignored too frequently in the past			1
‘ following the horrors of @entity128 , we have established a new rigorous inspection regime led by the chief inspector of @entity131			0
‘ he will look at mortality data as well as issues of leadership and culture , and we will act quickly where problems are uncovered			0
’ figures show that the death rates in @entity31 hospitals last year were 45 per cent higher than in @entity9			1
file picture sir @entity27 pioneered the use of hospital standardised mortality ratios ( @entity146 ) as a way of measuring whether death rates are higher or lower than expected			1
they are adjusted for factors such as age and the severity of the patient ’s illness			0
it was by using @entity146 that professor @entity27 was able to identify the high mortality rates at the @entity54 trust			0
he said one of the reasons that @entity9 hospitals do much better is because staff are actively encouraged to report mistakes – and whistleblowers are not persecuted as they sometimes are in the @entity3			1
he said : ‘ if you go to the @entity168 doctors can talk about problems , nurses can raise problems and listen to patient complaints			0
hospitals were urged yesterday to ensure consultants work seven days a week			0
the @entity174 , which issued the call , also wants specialist doctors to travel to see elderly patients on wards			0
a patient with several illnesses such as angina , diabetes and dementia often has to travel to clinics dotted around their hospital			0
the @entity174 also wants a chief of medicine to be appointed in every hospital to oversee the care of the elderly .			0

clinical care trails the rest of the @entity194 , it has emerged
@entity6 have five times the chance of dying from pneumonia than @entity9
@entity3 death rates are much higher than many western @entity18 countries
