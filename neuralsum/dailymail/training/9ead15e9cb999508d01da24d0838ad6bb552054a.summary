by @entity0 published : 06:30 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 20:26 est , 10 may 2013 the @entity1 was mired in a sex abuse scandal yesterday after a former choirboy alleged he was groomed and drawn into a sexual relationship by a senior cleric			1
@entity6 said he was first singled out by the @entity7 , the very reverend @entity8 , at the age of 11 and was then a close companion of his over a five - year period			1
the allegations made in public by mr @entity6 for the first time yesterday led to suggestions of a cover - up over the @entity1 ’s response following complaints to bishops in 2003			1
victim : @entity6 was repeatedly molested by @entity21 while a choirboy at @entity23 but the former archbishop of @entity25 , @entity24 , who at the time oversaw the @entity23 diocese , said he did not tell police and social services because @entity1 rules then did not require it and because the @entity31 was dying of cancer			1
mr @entity6 , now 40 , said he was sleeping in the @entity31 ’s bed by the time he was 13 and by his mid-teens was spending almost every weekend and many nights at the cleric ’s house			2
he went with him on holidays to @entity40 , the @entity41 , @entity42 and the @entity43			0
the abuse started when mr @entity8 began the grooming process in 1984 and ended after suspicions were raised in the @entity23 diocese in 1989 , mr @entity6 told the @entity48 newspaper			1
in 2004 , @entity49 , who had by then retired , was stripped of his right to lead @entity1 services by @entity24 but no information was passed on to police or social services			1
the @entity31 died in 2007			0
yesterday @entity24 said : ‘ i strenuously deny , and am obviously disappointed at , the suggestion that myself or my team at the time would have acted negligently in this or any other safeguarding matter			2
‘ there is no automatic legal obligation on the @entity1 to refer allegations by adults to the police or social services			1
scandal : former archbishop of york @entity24 , left , was told of child sex abuse allegations against @entity7 @entity8 , right , but did not report them to the police ‘ in considering whether children would be at risk from @entity8 i decided under these guidelines that this would not be the case given his serious ill health following cancer surgery			1
the following year i revoked @entity8 ’s permission to officiate			2
’ @entity24 added : ‘ i am deeply aware of the pain caused to any victim of child abuse , especially at the hands of a trustworthy person within the @entity1			1
’ mr @entity6 ’s lawyers have now made a personal injury compensation claim against the @entity31 of @entity23			2
he said that until last year he thought he could deal with the memories but then he felt ‘ there ’s something drastically wrong with me and i then started to scream very loudly that i needed help			0
’ mr @entity6 said he came from a poor background in @entity90 and joined the cathedral choir in @entity23 at the age of seven			2
four years later @entity49 , a former headmaster and then the most senior education official working for the @entity1 ’s parliament , the @entity94 , arrived in the city			0
he said the @entity31 showed him special favour , helping him with his homework , picking him up in his car to take him to choir practice , asking him out to tea and taking him for days out			0
he asked mr @entity6 ’s mother if the boy could stay with him overnight			0
the room in which the boy slept had a large poster of a horrifying painting by 16th century artist @entity108 , which gave him nightmares			0
cathedral : @entity8 targeted @entity23 choirboys as well as pupils at an @entity115 boarding school mr @entity6 said : ‘ he turned round to me one day and said , “ would you rather stay in my room ? is that painting too scary for you ? ” and of course i said yes			1
’ mr @entity6 began sleeping in the @entity31 ’s bed , where eventually hugs became kissing			0
he said that sexual contact began after he was distressed over a break - up with a girlfriend			0
he said he felt obliged to perform sexual acts when the @entity31 asked : ‘ do you love me this much ? ’ mr @entity6 told the @entity48 he had now broken off contact with his own family			1
he said : ‘ i have no relationship with my family now because i asked severe , strong questions of my family : why did you let it happen ? i was the boyfriend of a monster – so what does that make me ? ’ mr @entity6 said that he was told by the @entity31 that if questioned by the @entity140 he should lie about what was going on			2
after a senior cathedral official did begin to inquire about the relationship , the @entity31 told mr @entity6 to quit the choir in 1989 and he did so			2
he last saw the @entity31 on his wedding day , when the @entity31 conducted the ceremony			0
mr @entity6 later told his wife about the abuse			1
‘ as soon as i told her , our relationship split like an axe , ’ he added			0
