by @entity0 published : 07:19 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 12:05 est , 12 april 2013 for the adult who 's never outgrown a childhood love of @entity5 , this could be the home of their dreams			0
because while @entity9 , which is for sale in north @entity13 's exclusive @entity12 is undoubtedly sophisticated , it also bears more than a passing resemblance to the plastic construction bricks we all remember from our youth			1
inside , however , the £ 34m house offers the ultimate in grown - up luxury , with wall - to - wall mirrors , steam - room , and a ballroom with polished floor the size of a normal house			0
no expense has been spared in the refurbishment of this 1930s @entity30 - style home on the @entity12 - you just need £ 34m ( and then some ) to afford it built in @entity30 style in 1925 , it is one of the largest houses on a street that boasts some of the @entity39 's most impressive - and expensive - properties			1
the @entity12 , also known as @entity41 ' row , is home to oil barons , oligarchs and royalty from @entity45 , the @entity46 and @entity47			1
@entity50 and @entity51 , the agents who are selling the vast home , are sure the house 's features and high - end specification will ensure finding a buyer for @entity9 will be no trouble			0
the ambassadorial style house boasts nine bedrooms , eight bathrooms , five reception rooms and - despite being located only a short drive from the centre of @entity13 - almost one acre of land			1
one of the stand - out features of the mansion , which was recently rebuilt and has a look of ( albeit very expensive ) @entity5 about its exterior , is the ballroom which takes up a staggering 2,700sq/ft - making it perfect for entertaining guests			2
the room , which could also double up as an art gallery , has the same floor - space as an average family home			0
the mirrored ballroom has roughly the floorspace of a family 's average - sized house - but the buyer of @entity81 probably wo n't have to vacuum it themselves with polished marble floor , contemporary artwork and dramatic staircase , guests at the newly - refurbished house will enjoy making quite an entrance no expense spared : @entity9 has nine bedrooms , eight bathrooms , and an impressive - particularly for @entity13 - one - acre garden you would need to have put in some hard work in @entity9 's gym before you could feel totally confident having a bath in this hall of mirrors @entity81 , which will attract a stamp duty bill of £ 2.4m if it sells for the asking price , also has a 12 - metre indoor swimming pool with separate gym , steam and sauna rooms , and a massage / hairdressing / spa room			1
there is also a champagne bar , complete with glitzy silver seating and mirrored bar , where the new owner will be able to toast his or her purchase			1
@entity113 , director of @entity114 , has sold £ 3 billion worth of properties on @entity12 over the past 35 years			2
he said : ' @entity81 has @entity30 and this is unique in the area			0
that is why the local authority has listed the building and , as such , preserved its architectural heritage			0
the dirty plasters and stray hairs of public swimming pools will not trouble the new owner of @entity81 - it boasts its own indoor 12 - metre pool , plus separate gym @entity9 has a jacuzzi and relaxation area beside the pool , which enjoys natural light and @entity133 windows onto the one - acre garden for those wanting to unwind after a hard session in the gym or pool , the mansion has a marble and polished - wood floored champagne bar , complete with silver banquette seating and mirrored bar there is a subterranean cinema with luxurious burgundy velvet walls where the buyer will be able to relax and forget about their mortgage repayments for a while this dramatic bathroom is one of eight in the mansion , although if the lady of the house does not feel like washing her own hair , she could pop into the hairdressing salon ' the pool and leisure area is absolutely stunning and what can one say when you have your own bespoke art gallery / ballroom area and champagne bar , how decadent			1
' this is a home for the family that has everything except a home of this quality			0
you just have to bring your food and clothes and you are ready to rock and roll			0
' the property is spread over four floors with the leisure complex which includes a cinema based on the subterranean level			2
outside , there is a huge drive at the front while the rear boasts an @entity181 sunken garden , raised garden , water features and a two - bedroom cottage for staff			2
@entity9 has one acre of garden , which has been landscaped to provide a relatively easy - to maintain space complete with box hedges and small trees this high - spec kitchen may not be the house 's strong spot ( and looks like it 'd be tricky to keep clean ) but the buyer of the house probably wo n't use it themselves this pretty bedroom has expensive carpet , sloped ceiling and an attractive round window dating back to the house 's origins in the @entity202 period @entity9 's garden is impressively large for a house so near central @entity13 , and water features , pergolas , and a grass lawn that would be perfect for croquet the @entity209 is already home to oligarchs , royalty and oil barons , but @entity9 is still one of the biggest houses on the street the dining table comfortably seats 14 and boasts polished wood parquet flooring , handpainted panels , and a high - spec lighting system parquet floors , polished marble and mirrored walls are features of the vast mansion in @entity12 the nine - bedroom house looks dramatic at night with its state of the art lighting system and landscaped garden with corridors lined with gleaming marble and abstract art , the £ 34m house looks more like an expensive hotel than a home at the moment to afford a house like this you probably have a business or two - @entity81 comes with a smart office where the new owner will be able to work in peace the £ 34m house boasts a stunning , aquamarine tiled steam room where the residents and their guests can sweat away their worries in some style this kitchen is rather more attractive than the other one , and boasts natural light as well , so perhaps the family of the house might find themselves tempted to cook the odd thing in here - in one of the four ovens ... you would n't want to have a ' fat day ' in here , no matter how rich you are - the heavily - mirrored dressing room would be a nightmare if you were n't feeling confident about how you looked the in - house hairdressing salon has more mirrors , plus leather - padded walls , as well as a bed for massage treatments this spare room has a built - in flat - screen tv and plenty of room for guests at @entity81 in north @entity13 to sprawl out in the super king - size bed whoever designed the house for its recent refurbishment was fond of geometrically - framed vistas : the marble staircase and the garden 's pergolas are both stunning natural light pours in through the cupola , highlighting the expensively polished wooden floor - and acres of space ( plus more mirrors ) an in - house sauna is de rigueur for the mega-rich these days , so @entity9 is fitted with a large one as standard this ensuite bathroom offers views onto the garden , a large bath with marble surround , and modern sink and high - pressure shower luxury fittings in the house include smart polished wood wardrobes , left , and a breath - taking shower lined with astonishingly beautiful polished stone , right			1
