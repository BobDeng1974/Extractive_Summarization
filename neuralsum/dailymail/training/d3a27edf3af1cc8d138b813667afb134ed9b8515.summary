a group of businessmen are to trawl a lake near @entity3 in search of almost £ 1billion worth of @entity6 gold allegedly dumped by @entity7			1
the @entity9 chief is said to have disposed of the treasure in the spring of 1945 to stop the @entity12 @entity11 getting their hands on it as they closed in on the @entity16 capital			1
up to 18 boxes of gold were apparently thrown in @entity19 , about an hour ’s drive north of @entity3 in the former communist @entity21			2
@entity19 lies in north - west @entity21 , close to the former home of @entity7 and was trawled unsuccessfully by the @entity21 in 1986 @entity25 slave workers ordered to dump it were allegedly machine - gunned on the shore afterwards , their bodies following the gold into the @entity32 1986 @entity31 chief @entity30 ordered a trawl of the water but nothing was found			1
now the search has been reignited after claims by a local priest			2
the lake will be searched by submarines from october in a hunt financed by a group of unidentified businessmen			2
the priest , @entity44 , 77 , who has researched the legend of the treasure , said : ‘ they did n’t have the technology in the @entity49 to properly examine the lake			2
‘ but there are enough local people still around to know that the gold is there – and the bodies of the poor souls forced to dump it into the water			0
' @entity7 emptied his country home , @entity60 , of its loot and art treasures shortly before ordering it to be dynamited in the closing weeks of the war as the @entity11 marched on @entity3			1
@entity65 : a formal portrait of @entity7 , who amassed astonishing wealth from lands under the @entity6 jackboot according to authorities , the documents @entity30 worked from still lie undiscovered in the millions of papers that make up the @entity3 archive of the @entity31 secret police			0
@entity7 garnered astonishing wealth from lands conquered by the @entity77 in the @entity78 , including dozens of rare masterpieces from galleries across @entity81			0
each weekend the ruins of @entity60 attract dozens of treasure hunters who believe that some of his wealth still lies in the grounds of the old mansion			0
the consortium have been bolstered in their confidence of finding treasure from papers found in the @entity93 in @entity94			0
@entity96 documents together with post-war eye witness statements to the events on the lake in march 1945 , give credence to the theory that precious material was indeed dumped into the 400 - feet deep lake			1
one witness , @entity104 , told a post-war allied commission : ' i remember well the night that lorries with slit headlights drove up to the lakeshore and i saw about 20 to 30 skeletal figures dressed in striped concentration camp uniforms being forced to unload heavy boxes			0
' these were put into two rowing boats which made six separate trips to the centre of the lake			0
' when the last case had been thrown overboard , the men returned to shore , were lined up and the last thing i saw were the flashes of the machine guns of the guards as they were killed			1
' he said the bodies were then loaded back onto the rowing boats which were then taken out by the @entity96 to the centre of the lake and sunk			0
a third boat brought back the @entity96 men to the shore			0
@entity7 is alleged to have personally taken charge of numerous amounts of bullion from the national bank of @entity25 following the @entity6 invasion in 1939			1
