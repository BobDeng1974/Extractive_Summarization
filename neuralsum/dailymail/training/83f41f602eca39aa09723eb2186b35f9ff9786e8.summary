a group calling itself ' @entity1 ' is making robocalls across the @entity3 in an attempt to link @entity6 members of the @entity7 to ' the war on women led by @entity10 '			1
the automated calls are illegal because they do not state who they are from ( there is no known group called @entity1 ) or provide a callback number , as required under the @entity3 @entity16			2
they appear to be the most aggressive attempt yet by @entity19 to exploit politically the recent furore over comments by the controversial conservative radio talk show host			2
scroll down to hear the call controversy : @entity10 kicked off a national firestorm with his comments @entity10 apologised last sunday for his ' insulting word choices ' when speaking about @entity28 , a student activist campaigning for contraception to be paid for by @entity30 , a @entity31 institution , under president @entity33 's healthcare reform			1
the radio host had said she was a ' slut ' because she was asking to be paid for having sex and then commented that she should repay the public by releasing videos of her sexual activities ' so we can all watch '			0
@entity10 's comments had been widely denounced , including by @entity42 , @entity6 @entity43 , and @entity33 , in what @entity6 branded an attempt to make political capital , telephoned @entity28 to commiserate			1
democrats have been taking republicans to task over the comments			0
@entity51 , the @entity33 campaign 's top strategist , said that @entity53 , the @entity6 frontrunner , had failed ' a test of leadership ' over ' the @entity10 thing '			1
he ask how if a candidate could n't stand up to ' the most strident voices in your party , how can he stand up to @entity60 ? ' activist : the radio host called @entity28 a ' slut ' after she spoke out in favour of easy access to contraception a call left on the answering machine of @entity69 of @entity70 , @entity71 yesterday stated : ' hello , this is a message from @entity1			1
congressman @entity72 is condoning the war on women led by @entity10 , who has become the de facto leader of the @entity6			1
' call congressman @entity72 at 330 - 489 - 4414 and ask him why he remains silent while @entity6 spokesman @entity10 insults , degrades , and verbally abuses women			1
tell congressman @entity72 that it ’s just plain shameful that he that he allows @entity10 ’s behaviour to continue			1
we are the @entity1 and we wo n’t be silent anymore			0
' as well mrs @entity69 's @entity71 - 16 district of representative @entity72 , there were similar calls in rep. @entity86 's @entity85 - 6 , rep. @entity87 's @entity88 - 1 , rep. @entity89 's @entity90 - 13 , rep. @entity91 's @entity90 - 15 , rep. @entity94 's @entity90 - 17 and rep. @entity93 's @entity92 - 2			2
the robocalls prompted hundreds of angry calls to @entity6 congressional offices			0
@entity98 : constituents of @entity71 @entity6 @entity72 have been contacted by a robocall focussed around mr @entity10 mrs @entity69 sent out a tweet about the call and then posted an audio file of it on the @entity106 website after being contacted by @entity107			1
in a blog post , she wrote : ' apparently , unless you are throwing a public temper tantrum about @entity10 ’s inappropriate and malicious comments , you are " condoning " them			1
by this standard , 99 per cent of the country is guilty			0
' she added : ' we should all feel great compassion for the poor souls who had to answer the phones and listen to the angry rants that resulted from these robocalls			0
' a blogger called ' @entity124 ' from @entity88 wrote that the claim against rep @entity87 was ' one wildly outrageous accusation to make by an unidentified " group " who , by the way , is now intruding into the privacy of my home			2
' hmmm ... no number shows on the caller id , and * 69 only prompts the phone company 's recorded message that they are unable to determine the phone number used			0
' criticism : @entity42 , speaker of the @entity139 , is one of many republicans to have spoken out against mr @entity10 last week , the @entity141 ( @entity141 ) organised a petition accusing @entity6 of having ' launched an all - out war on women '			1
the petition said that @entity6 were ' trying to silence women who stand against their radical agenda ' and @entity3 had witnessed ' top @entity6 leaders squirm at denouncing or even criticising @entity10 after he called women 's health care advocate @entity28 a " slut " and a " prostitute " on his radio show			1
' @entity152 , spokesman for rep. @entity91 , said that some people calling as a result of the robocalls were not even in the congressman 's district but part of a new district created after boundary changes he will be running for in november - a sign the calls are linked to this year 's elections			2
he said : ' how do we not " allow " @entity10 to say what he wants ? we believe in free speech			2
at the same time , we do n’t condone name - calling or caustic language from either the @entity171 or @entity172			0
that is why representative @entity91 formed the @entity174 in 2005 and continually advocates civility			0
' @entity176 , spokeswoman for @entity177 , said : ' we were surprised to hear this since @entity179 spoke out about this days ago			0
' he stated mr @entity10 ’s comments on the religious freedom issue are deplorable and wrong , just as he also feels that the @entity183 is wrong to violate the religious conscience rights of others			2
we hope the organisation spreading these inaccurate statements will issue a retraction			0
' telephone calls and emails to the @entity141 and the @entity191 asking whether either organisation was connected to the robocalls were not returned			0
