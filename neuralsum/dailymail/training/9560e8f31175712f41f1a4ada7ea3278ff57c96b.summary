@entity0 insists he has no issue with the @entity2 booing @entity4 duo @entity3 and @entity5 — as long as it is on purely footballing grounds			1
both players were born in @entity9 but opted to use family ties to represent the @entity11			1
while playing in @entity12 with @entity13 and @entity14 , respectively , they suffered abuse at the hands of rival fans			1
@entity5 ( left ) in action for @entity19 on saturday afternoon , pictured alongside @entity20 now @entity19 team - mates in the @entity22 , however , @entity0 has seen the duo attract huge transfer fees since and believes any abuse from the @entity12 support in next week ’s @entity28 qualifier at @entity29 will be a testament to their footballing abilities			1
asked if @entity32 fans should lay off the pair , @entity0 — who named @entity36 youngster @entity35 in a 27 - man squad yesterday — said : ‘ no , they can do what they want			1
‘ are you going to ask them to pay 60 quid and then tell them they ca n’t say something ? ‘ as long as you do n’t have that nastiness about it , then that is fine			2
but we have all been booed			2
i used to come here ( to @entity29 ) regularly and get booed			1
it did n’t bother me			0
and that was when i was the manager			0
‘ it is part of football			0
it is like pantomime stuff			0
as long as it is pantomime humour , then we do n’t mind that			2
if it goes beyond that , then that ’s not fine			0
’ addressing claims that previous abuse of @entity3 and @entity5 might have betrayed a strain of anti-irish sentiment in @entity32 football , @entity0 believes it might now happen for a different reason			1
@entity3 also played in the match on saturday , he is pictured ( left ) vying for the ball with @entity69 ‘ do you know why they ’ll get booed ? it is because they are good players , ’ he said			1
‘ if they were useless , they would not boo them			0
‘ as long as you keep it to the boos and leave it like that , so it is pantomime booing , that is what i like			2
they are getting booed because they are terrific players			0
’ @entity5 ’s grandfather hailed from @entity91 and was a strong influence on his career , while @entity3 also qualified for @entity94 via the grandparent rule and played for @entity94 up to under - 17 level before the @entity97 fully appreciated his ability			1
@entity101 on the decision both players made , @entity0 insisted : ‘ listen , you play for whatever country you feel you are			1
if you feel @entity4 , then you play for @entity94 and , if you feel you are @entity32 , then you play for @entity12			1
‘ my boys are as @entity32 as anyone but have lived most of their time in @entity106			2
‘ whatever you feel you are , wherever you feel you come from , where your family come from , you do that			0
i do n’t have a problem with that			0
’ @entity0 says he is happy for @entity12 fans to boo the pair , but if it is in the right spirit as @entity13 manager , @entity0 ’s relationship with @entity3 was occasionally strained			1
the @entity19 player has admitted that abuse from @entity32 fans irritated him in the past but the @entity12 manager believes booing will have no impact on his former charge			1
‘ absolutely not , ’ he said			0
‘ it will not bother him			0
he is a terrific player , so it will not bother him , and it will not bother @entity5			2
despite widespread criticism of ticket prices , the @entity97 are close to a 60,000 sell - out for the encounter with the @entity11 — with travelling supporters allocated just over 3,000 briefs			2
@entity0 , meanwhile , said there was no question of @entity134 quitting the @entity12 set - up , following his resignation as @entity138 manager			1
‘ no , we did n’t even think about that , ’ he said			0
‘ i think he is fine			0
’ @entity143 full - back @entity142 has been recalled to the squad in the absence of the injured @entity146 .			0

@entity3 and @entity5 were both born in @entity9
they *elected* to play for the @entity11 through family ties
the pair have been booed by @entity32 fans on a number of occasions
@entity94 play @entity12 at @entity29 on *november* 14
@entity0 says he is happy for the pair to be booed as long as it is purely based on footballing ability
