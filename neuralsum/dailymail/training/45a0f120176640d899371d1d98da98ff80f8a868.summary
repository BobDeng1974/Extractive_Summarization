by @entity1 - potter to a tea : new research claims the optimum length of time to leave tea to stew is just 25 seconds it 's a debate that ’s been brewing almost as long as there ’s been tea : just how long should you leave the bag to stew ? now at last one expert has what he says is the definitive answer – and it is a result that goes against everything the manufacturers say			1
the optimum length of time to leave in the bag , according to professional food and drink taster @entity21 , is exactly 25 seconds			1
‘ any less , and there ’s not enough flavour , any longer , and there ’s too much tannin , giving your tea a horrible stewed taste , ’ said mr @entity21 , who tested bags from @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 – which together account for 81 per cent of the @entity31 tea market			1
running his trial with strict controls , the 59 - year - old tested the bags in the same teacup throughout , using freshly boiled bottled water and stirring each cup just once			0
his findings contradict the advice on the boxes , which ranges from @entity26 ’ suggested 40 seconds to four to five minutes for @entity49			0
mr @entity21 drank 400 cups in 48 hours to draw his conclusion and believes the demands of impatient consumers are behind the brewing speed			1
he said : ‘ @entity55 , smaller tea leaf particles are used because they release flavour quickly			2
' bags have to be filled with tiny particles of broken leaves that have lost the wonderful flavour nuances associated with full - leaf @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity65 teas			0
’ the connoisseur , who prefers first - flush @entity67 at £ 700 for 100g , claims @entity49 offered the best taste			0
‘ with @entity49 , you can get away with a 30 - second brew time but no more , ’ he said			1
as to why manufacturers recommend lengthy brewing times , mr @entity21 , who runs the website @entity72 , said : ‘ perhaps they ’re trying to suggest that they sell a better product than they really are			2
three to five minutes is only appropriate for the very best teas			0
’ the results have divided industry opinion			0
tea master @entity83 , of maker @entity82 , agreed			0
he said : ‘ @entity85 with tiny tea particles will deliver a very quick infusion in around 25 seconds , but the downside is that they compromise on clear regional and varietal flavour			1
’ but @entity90 , chairman of @entity31 - based tea farm owner @entity91 , which supplies the main five brands except @entity24 , dismissed the claims			0
he said : ‘ i ’m not convinced by the research – 25 seconds is nowhere near enough time to release those important antioxidants			1
’ professional taster @entity21 drank 400 cups of tea in 48 hours to draw his conclusion ( file picture ) tea brewing time has long been a hot topic , and in 2011 a team of academics devised a mathematical formula claiming to prove the perfect cuppa is best drunk exactly six minutes after being made			1
the optimum brew time , they found , was two minutes			1
and last week , the @entity110 backed claims by @entity26 that their pyramid - shaped bags released more flavour than @entity24 ’s round bags			0
a @entity25 spokesman said : ‘ we would recommend that the tea is brewed for two to three minutes to get the maximum flavour and depth of colour from the tea			2
’ a spokesman for @entity49 said : ‘ we recommend brewing for four to five minutes in order to get a proper brew with a rich , full flavour			2
’ @entity24 said customers should brew in whichever way gives them their perfect cup			2
a spokesman added : ‘ we say two to three minutes more as a guideline which will let the flavour of the tea infuse			0
’ a @entity27 spokesman said : ‘ we generally suggest a brew time of three - and - a - half minutes			1
’ and a spokesman for @entity26 added : ‘ while we recommend an optimum brewing time ( 40 seconds ) , it should always come down to personal preference			0

professional food and drink taster believes 25 seconds is perfect brew time
@entity21 , 59 , drank 400 cups of tea in 48 hours to come to the conclusion
@entity148 if left longer there is stewed taste , but any quicker and it has no flavour
