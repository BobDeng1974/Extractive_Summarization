good bacteria : gut microbes are being linked to mental health issues people suffering from anxiety , might just need to eat more ' healthy ' bacteria			1
some scientists think there may be a link between our digestive tract microbes and disorders such as anxiety , schizophrenia and autism			0
they are beginning to recognise the power of healthy gut bacteria , especially seeing that the average adult carries up to five pounds of bacteria - trillions of microbes - in their digestive tract			1
probiotics are commonly consumed as part of fermented foods with specially added active live cultures , such as in yogurt , soy yogurt or as dietary supplements			1
probiotics are also delivered in fecal transplants , in which stool from a healthy donor is delivered like a suppository to an infected patient			1
a study published in @entity34 from the @entity35 , has shown that @entity37 levels - the chemical byproduct of the clostridia bacteria - are much higher in the urine of autistic children			1
those treated with antibiotics effective against clostridia show a decrease in symptoms of autism			0
dr @entity48 , a @entity49 - area psychiatrist , treated a teenager with severe obsessive – compulsive disorder ( @entity52 ) , as well as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( @entity54 ) and an array of digestive problems			1
@entity48 first did a simple urine test for the metabolite @entity37 and found that it was elevated			0
he put the patient , @entity59 , on a course of high - powered probiotics to boost her good bacteria , followed by antibiotics , and her levels began to ‘ dramatically ’ go down , he told @entity65			1
after six months , @entity59 's symptoms began to disappear			0
and by a year , they were gone			0
today , three years later , @entity59 is a senior in high school and has no sign of either mental disorder			0
autism : @entity37 levels - the chemical byproduct of the clostridia bacteria - are much higher in the urine of autistic children dr @entity48 , a @entity49 - area psychiatrist , says all doctors should make organic acid urine testing for @entity37 levels a standard practice in some patients , the strep bacterium has been linked to @entity52 in a condition known as @entity83 - an acronym for @entity85 with streptococcal infections			1
@entity83 , which is a rare disease that usually appears in children , is hypothesised to be an autoimmune disorder that results in a variable combination of tics , obsessions , compulsions , and other symptoms that may be severe enough to qualify for diagnoses such as chronic tic disorder , @entity52 and @entity98 syndrome			2
a 10 - year - old from @entity100 was treated with probiotics after being incorrectly diagnosed with @entity83 after he developed compulsive symptoms following a strep infection and a lengthy course on antibiotics			1
‘ he had no gut flora , ’ said his mother , @entity106 , who did not want to use her last name			2
‘ he had been healthy and athletically coordinated and then developed these compulsive behavior and tics			2
it did n't seem like it was in his control			0
’ after probiotics , ‘ it was like night and day ’ , she told @entity65			2
‘ his symptoms went away and he was totally fine			0
’ a recent study in the journal @entity120 shows that thin and fat people have different bacteria -- a discovery that could lead to weight - loss programmes			2
babies are born with a sterile digestive tract and first acquire their bacteria while traveling through the birth canal and get more in breast milk and in the world outside the womb through contact with other people			0
sterile : babies are born with zero microbes in their digestive tract and first acquire their bacteria while traveling through the birth canal and then through breast milk scientists are so far unable to identify every strain of bacteria , but they can test for the chemical byproducts that they produce , according to @entity48			0
he said he checks every patient for @entity37 with a simple organic acid urine test before moving ahead with medications to treat symptoms			0
' eight out of 10 people are fine , ' he said			0
' but in the two patients where it 's elevated , it can have profound effects on the nervous system			1
' ' i do n't know why this test is n't done on every psychiatric patient , ' he said			0
' i question that every day			0
' @entity37 causes deactivation of an enzyme so that dopamine can not be converted to the neurotransmitter neuroepinephrine , @entity48 said , and that causes a build - up of dopamine			1
' we know elevated levels in the dopamine gene cause agitation , ' he told @entity65			1
in one 2010 study at @entity171 in @entity172 , published in the journal @entity174 and @entity175 , scientists found a link between intestinal microbiota and anxiety - like behaviour			2
researchers compared the behaviours of normal 8 - week - old mice and those whose guts were stripped of microbes			0
those without bacteria showed higher levels of risk - taking and the stress hormone cortisol			1
they also had altered levels of the brain chemical @entity192 , which has been linked to anxiety and depression in humans			2
lab mice : a test showed that those without bacteria showed higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol and altered levels of the brain chemical @entity192 , which has been linked to anxiety and depression in humans @entity208 , associate professor of neuroscience and behavioral science and part of the @entity171 & @entity212 , says gut bacteria ‘ talk to the brain in multiple ways through either the immune system or the enteric nervous system ’			1
however , while using probiotics may help a ‘ subset of patients ’ , she said			2
it 's not a ‘ magic bullet ’			0
early life stresses , nutrition and building a strong immune system all play an important role in a person 's mental health , she said .			1

gut bacteria ‘ talk to the brain ' through the immune system or parts of the nervous system
