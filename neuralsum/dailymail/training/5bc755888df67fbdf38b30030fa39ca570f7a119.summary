by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ samcunningham hundreds of millions are once again being spent in the transfer market this summer , but there is still no greater feeling of satisfaction for a club than to bring through a youngster and see them flourish in the first team			1
it is a huge challenge for young stars with bags of potential to earn the chance to make the step up and go on to become a regular in the senior side			1
here , @entity19 takes a look at the best young players in the country to watch out for who could be set to make that breakthrough this season			2
club : @entity27 : @entity28 @entity29 was raving about @entity30 after he set up all three goals in their 3 - 2 pre-season friendly win against @entity33			1
the 19 - year - old scored 17 goals for the @entity37 side last season			0
he is known for his deadly set piece delivery and can produce moments of magic from nowhere			0
moments of magic : @entity30 celebrates scoring for @entity27 in the under 21 final at @entity45 club : @entity47 : striker / winger the @entity50 forward has dad @entity51 to call on if he ever needs tips on scoring goals			1
@entity54 has worked his way through @entity50 's academy and @entity57 called him up to the squad for their pre-season tour of @entity60 last summer			1
the @entity61 is known to be a fan			0
family affair : @entity54 , son of @entity45 legend @entity51 , will hope to emulate his father 's success club : @entity47 : centre back his ability on the ball and reading of the game have drawn comparison to @entity73 – and surely also the fact he is a @entity76 centre half			1
recently called up to the @entity76 under 21 side			0
captain material ? @entity79 has been compared to @entity50 first - team skipper @entity73 club : @entity81 : attacking midfielder it will be tough for the @entity84 to break through with the wealth of players in a similar position available to @entity88 , but he is highly rated by the club			0
@entity90 has played for the first team in the @entity92 already			0
in action : @entity90 has already tasted life in @entity81 's first - team having played in the @entity92 club : @entity97 : defender / midfielder he is on the verge of a move to @entity102 after handing in a transfer request at @entity97			2
the @entity105 - born player has been capped by @entity106 up to under 19 level			0
those who have watched him play regularly say he is in the mould of @entity112			0
was the youngest player ever to take to the field for @entity97 , aged just 15 , when he came on as a substitute in 2011			0
high praise : @entity118 ( right ) has been compared to former @entity106 defender @entity112 club : @entity120 : winger / attacking midfielder the @entity123 under 21 midfielder has spent time on loan at @entity127 and played a part in the @entity130 side who won the @entity133 last season			1
he made the bench of the senior @entity130 team aged just 16			0
winning feeling : @entity137 played a part in the @entity130 side that won the @entity133 last season club : @entity142 : winger @entity144 has played a couple of first team games for @entity142 already but this looks like his season to really break through			1
the 5ft 7in flyer has looked the part in pre-season so far , setting up both goals in their 2 - 1 win against @entity155			0
he 's a fast , direct winger and it is understood @entity158 is a huge admirer			2
star in the making : winger @entity144 ( right ) has impressed in @entity142 's two pre-season friendlies to date club : @entity164 : central midfielder he was captain of the @entity106 under 17 team who won the @entity169 in may and even scored a penalty in the decisive final shootout against @entity172			1
considers himself to be similar to @entity174 in his playing style			0
still very young , but that did n't stop @entity177 or @entity178 getting a chance at @entity180			2
box - to - box starlet : @entity182 captained @entity183 to @entity169 glory in may club : @entity186 : winger joined @entity186 's famed academy aged eight and has been with the club since			2
the predominantly left - sided player has featured once for the first team , in the @entity193			2
recently signed a new four - year deal			0
tied down : @entity195 ( right ) has recently penned a new four - year deal at @entity186 club : @entity198 : attacking midfielder another who was part of the @entity106 under 17 side to lift the @entity169 trophy			0
new @entity204 manager @entity203 is known for bringing youth players into the first team , increasing his chances this season			0
some at the club believe this could be his year			0
opportune moment : @entity211 will be hoping new @entity204 boss @entity203 gives youth a chance club : @entity215 : @entity28 / striker the @entity216 under 21 star has scored in each of @entity142 's opening friendlies against @entity219 and @entity155			1
those goals earned him a place in the squad for their pre-season tour of @entity225 , having previously not made the cut			0
things are looking up : @entity228 has scored in both of @entity142 's pre-season fixtures so far club : @entity186 : midfielder @entity232 has already been around @entity186 's first team , making seven appearances for the seniors			1
with the departures of key players this summer he could become a more regular figure in the side this campaign			0
chance : @entity232 ( left ) could feature often for @entity186 next season following the sale of key players club : @entity47 : centre - back @entity246 , born in @entity172 but of @entity248 descent , has already been capped by the senior @entity249			0
he has only made one brief appearance for @entity50 's first team but his loan spell at @entity254 last season , where he made 25 league appearances , earned him a place in @entity259 's provisional squad for the @entity260			2
he did not make the final cut			0
international pedigree : @entity246 ( right ) was included in @entity172 's provisional @entity260 squad club : @entity265 : second striker / @entity28 @entity266 can play on the right wing , but he is devastating through the middle			1
at 5ft 5in he is smaller than most of his peers but his low centre of gravity has seen him compared to @entity272			0
scored twice on the way to winning the @entity274 with the @entity183 and has netted seven goals in 14 internationals for them			0
after @entity265 's relegation it is expected he will get plenty more playing time for their senior team next season			2
little gem : at 5ft 5in @entity266 ( right ) has been compared to @entity272 due to his low centre of gravity club : @entity287 : midfielder @entity289 has likened him to @entity290 already , even though he is just 17			1
@entity291 has got a bit of filling out to do but passes the ball well and is fearless			1
yet to play for @entity142 in a competitive fixture but this could be his season			1
eyes on the prize : @entity291 has been compared to @entity142 hero @entity290 by @entity289 club : @entity300 : left - back @entity302 is being lined up as the long - term replacement for @entity304 following his move to @entity45			1
another who has been at @entity186 's academy since he was eight			2
some expect him to follow in the footsteps of the two most famous left - sided players to come through at the south coast club			1
bright future : promising full - back @entity302 ( left ) will hope to emulate @entity304 's rise at @entity186 club : @entity316 : @entity28 / @entity317 the @entity318 joined @entity81 from @entity319 in 2011 and quickly caught the eye by scoring five times in seven appearances for their under 18 side			1
he was included in training with the senior squad last season			0
@entity318 : playmaker @entity327 ( left ) scored five times in seven appearances for @entity81 's under 18s club : @entity331 : striker announced himself on the scene with two goals in his first start for @entity45 in a 3 - 1 win against @entity339 , but that is his only appearance for the senior side			1
it was a surprise call - up by @entity344 while he was in charge at the club – and he predicted @entity347 would go on to become a new @entity349 star			1
dream start : @entity347 ( left ) scored twice in his @entity45 debut against @entity339 last season club : @entity354 : central midfielder made the bench for @entity198 's @entity358 quarter - final against @entity359 last season , so has had a taste of first - team action			1
again , with @entity203 at the helm , expect more @entity204 youngsters to be popping up in the senior squad			0
in pursuit : @entity198 's @entity366 ( left ) got a taste of first - team action last year on the bench against @entity359 club : @entity370 : @entity371 a former coach said that ' he dribbles like @entity373 and he passes like @entity374			2
' @entity375 has also hailed the player 's ability			2
@entity378 made his first - team debut in the @entity193 as a 16 - year - old , making him the first player born after @entity88 joined @entity81 to play for the first - team			1
history : @entity378 ( right ) is the first player born after @entity88 joined @entity81 to play for them			1

@entity142 's @entity144 and @entity45 's @entity347 have already featured in the @entity385
