by @entity1 reporter published : 12:59 est , 30 march 2013 updated : 13:02 est , 30 march 2013 a @entity3 battle flag hanging inside the old @entity4 to mark the sesquicentennial of the @entity6 last week is being taken down after upset by civil rights leaders			1
the decision was announced hours after a story ran about the flag that explained it as part of an historical display intended to replicate how the antebellum building appeared in 1863			2
the flag had been planned to hang in the @entity17 chamber until april 2015 , the 150th anniversary of the arrival of federal troops in @entity21 before its forced removal			2
removed : a @entity3 flag is seen on display at the @entity25 , which houses the governor 's office and still hosts numerous government events , making it therefore inappropriate for its hanging according to some ' this is a temporary exhibit in an historic site , but i 've learned the governor 's administration is going to use the old @entity17 chamber as working space , ' cultural resources secretary @entity31 said on friday night			1
' given that information , this display will end this weekend rather than april of 2015			0
' @entity41 , the spokeswoman for gov. @entity42 , said the exhibit that includes the @entity3 battle flag will be relocated , possibly across the street to the @entity46			1
the decision was a quick about - face for the @entity42 administration , which initially defended the display			0
but many people see the flag as a potent reminder of racial discrimination and bigotry , calling it a flag of white supremacy			1
state historic sites director @entity58 had said on thursday the flag should be viewed in what he called the proper historical context			0
' our goal is not to create issues , ' said @entity58 , a @entity6 re-enactor and history buff			2
' our goal is to help people understand issues of the past			0
... if you refuse to put something that someone might object to or have a concern with in the exhibit , then you are basically censoring history			0
' reflection : the flag is being taken down one week after its placement inside the capitol as part of a historical display intended to replicate how the antebellum building appeared in 1863 @entity4 @entity83 president rev. @entity82 was shocked on friday when he was shown a photo of the flag by the @entity86 ' he is right that it has a historical context , ' @entity82 said			1
' but what is that history ? the history of racism			0
if you say that should n't be offensive , then either you do n't know the history , or you are denying the history			0
' sessions of the @entity104 moved to a newer building a half - century ago , but the old @entity4 building is still routinely used as a venue for official state government events			2
@entity42 's office is on the first floor , as are the offices of his chief of staff and communications staff			0
the @entity115 governor was in the @entity17 chamber where the @entity3 flag hangs as recently as thursday , when he presided over the swearing - in ceremony of his new @entity120 commander			1
the presentation of the @entity3 battle flag at state government buildings has long been an issue of debate throughout the @entity126			1
for more than a decade , the @entity83 has urged its members to boycott @entity128 because of that state 's display of the flag on the @entity17 grounds			2
battle flag : many people see the flag , the @entity3 's battle flag seen waving below the @entity137 ' , as a potent reminder of racial discrimination and bigotry , calling it a flag of white supremacy prior to taking his current job in @entity4 in 2006 , @entity58 worked as director at the @entity146 home of @entity3 president @entity147 , which is operated as a museum and library owned by the @entity151			1
the group has led the fight in the @entity126 for the proud display of the @entity3 flag , which it contends is a symbol of heritage , not hate			1
@entity58 said the battle flag was displayed with other flags described in the diary of a @entity4 woman who visited the @entity4 in 1863			1
a large @entity137 flag displayed in the @entity165 chamber is reminiscent of a trophy of war captured from @entity169 troops at the @entity170			0
' i thought , would n't it be wonderful to recreate this ? ' @entity58 said			0
' i think we were all thinking along the same vein			0
... the @entity4 is both a working seat of government , in that the governor and his staff has his office there			2
but it is also a museum			0
' @entity58 pointed out that the national flag used by the @entity3 government , with its circle of white stars and red and white stripes , is still flown over the @entity4 dome each year on @entity189			1
the more familiar blood - red battle flag , featuring a blue ' x '' studded with white stars , was used by the rebel military			1
national flag : the @entity195 flag of the @entity3 , pictured , is annually flown over @entity4 's capitol to commemorate @entity189 in may @entity197 , a history professor at the @entity198 at @entity199 and author of the book ' still fighting the @entity6 , ' said the battle flag can hold starkly different meanings depending on a person 's social perspective			1
' the history of the @entity3 battle flag , how it was designed and formulated , how it has been used through the years , clearly states that it is a flag of white supremacy , ' @entity197 said			1
' i know current @entity151 would dispute that , saying “ hey , i 'm not a racist			0
” but the fact remains that the battle flag was used by a country that had as its foundation the protection and extension of human bondage			1
' the @entity83 's @entity82 said the @entity42 administration eventually made the right call , but questioned how the decision to hang the flag was made in the first place			2
' a flag should represent a banner of unity , not division , ' @entity82 said			0
' a substantive symbol and sign of our best history , not our worse			0
we can not deny history but neither can we attempt to revision it in a way that glorifies the shameful and attempts to make noble that which is ignoble			0

@entity3 battle flag was hanging inside the old @entity4 this week to mark the sesquicentennial of the @entity6
historians *backing* the flag 's placement say it is a symbol of heritage , not hate
