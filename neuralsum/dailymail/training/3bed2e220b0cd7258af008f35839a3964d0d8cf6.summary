@entity0 today insisted every country in the @entity2 has agreed that if the royal baby is a girl she will become @entity5			1
the prime minister said news the @entity8 has gone into labour is ‘ a very exciting occasion ’ and the whole country ‘ is hoping for the best ’			1
and he said a 300 - year law change will be enacted to ensure a first - born daughter will become monarch even if she has younger brothers			2
promise : @entity0 insisted that all 16 @entity2 countries had agreed to change the law to ensure a baby girl will become queen keeping watch : @entity23 police officers guard the entrance of @entity25 exclusive @entity26 of @entity27 has been admitted in the early stages of labour the historic change was approved by the @entity5 just four months ago to ensure it was on the statute book ahead of the birth			1
the leaders of all 16 @entity2 agreed to change gender discrimination laws before she was born			1
but yesterday it emerged just three outside @entity23 – @entity38 and @entity39 , @entity40 and the @entity41 and @entity42 - have changed their laws to enact the change			1
it was suggested that a first - born daughter would only become queen in countries which have changed the law , while a younger brother would in theory become king in those who had not			2
but today mr @entity0 insisted the deal he reached in october 2011 was binding			0
he told @entity55 ’s @entity56 : ‘ i ca n’t claim any role in this one , except for as prime minister i have one small thing , well it ’s a big thing actually which is to get all of the heads of the realms over which our @entity5 is @entity5 to agree that whatever the sex of the baby that @entity68 and @entity8 have , if it ’s a girl it will be our @entity5			1
‘ changing the succession is i think a big achievement , very important for our country and for all those realms over which our monarch governs			0
‘ and something we will find out quite soon whether it ’s going to kick into action or not			0
‘ everyone has agreed they ’ve agreed that even if the legislation has n’t gone through their parliament it will retrospectively apply to the child , so it ’s pretty much a done deal			0
’ guarantee : the law change means prince @entity90 and @entity8 's baby is certain to be monarch , whether it is a boy or a girl change : the @entity5 gave the new law @entity95 in april , to ensure it was passed before the birth			1
it means the change pushed prince @entity99 to fourth in line to the throne the law change means prince @entity99 will be pushed into fourth place in the line of succession to the throne			1
mr @entity0 led the call for the law to be over-turned to ensure the princess would not be leap - frogged if a younger brother was born later			0
it had been feared there could be a constitutional crisis if the royal couple had a baby girl before the law was changed			2
but the @entity5 approved the historic change by giving royal assent to the @entity119 in april			0
under the ancient rules of male primogeniture , first born royal daughters in direct line to the throne were over taken by younger male siblings			1
but the law was criticised and widely viewed as outdated and discriminatory			0
the scrapped law of male primogeniture only allowed @entity5 to become queen because she did not have any brothers			0
but the major constitutional change was accelerated after the @entity133 and @entity8 ’s wedding in april 2011			0
in october that year mr @entity0 announced that the 16 @entity2 countries where the @entity5 is head of state had agreed to give female royals the same rights of succession as their brothers			1
it meant amending some of @entity23 ’s key constitutional documents , including the @entity141 of 1688 , the 1701 @entity142 and the 1706 @entity143 with @entity144			2
the change in rules is not retrospective , so the princess royal will not jump ahead of her younger brothers the @entity133 and the @entity150			2
to take full effect it has to be legislated for in all of the @entity2 nations of the @entity23 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity42 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 , the @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity38 and @entity39 , @entity163 , the @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity40 and the @entity41 and @entity166			1
had the rule been in force before , @entity23 history would have been very different			0
part of the family : the royal baby will join future balcony line - ups in the months and years to come constitutional experts say that in 1509 @entity175 would have taken the throne instead of @entity177 , and as a result @entity178 would never have been @entity5			1
it would also have meant @entity5 @entity181 would have been succeeded by her daughter , princess @entity181 , the princess royal , in 1901 , and not @entity182 when she died just a few months later , her son @entity183 would have ascended the throne – something which could have prevented the @entity186			2
it is said the @entity5 now would have been the completely unknown princess @entity188			0
most @entity190 monarchies have already established an equal law of succession - it is in force in @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , the @entity199 and @entity200			0
now only @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203 are left with the old system .			0

@entity2 countries all agreed changes to line of succession rules
but only three outside @entity23 have passed new laws to enact it
prime minister insists change will be made and back - dated
the law of primogeniture meant boys *leapfrogged* older sisters
royal baby will be third in line to the throne , *higher* than @entity99
