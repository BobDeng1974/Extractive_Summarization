by @entity0 watching the neighbours stroll past my house always makes me smile			1
why ? because i can tell how jealous they are			2
for i know they will be observing the latest costly improvements to our four - bedroom , three - storey property and furiously calculating how much it would take to do the same to their far more inferior homes			1
the answer ? not far off £ 200,000			1
my husband @entity14 , 32 , a sports sponsorship manager , and i have spent the past four years pouring all of our savings into making sure ours is the best house on our street — because i wanted ours to be one that people stopped , stared and pointed at , for all the right reasons			1
pride : @entity0 outside her home ( on the left ) on which she spent £ 200,000 in home improvements improvement : the value of @entity0 's house has increased by £ 350,000 following the extensive renovation work we live in @entity34 , @entity35 , and our home — with its superior size , beautifully manicured garden and gleaming cream exterior — is head and shoulders above any others on our suburban street			1
the improvements may have cost us £ 189,000 in the end , but it ’s been worth it just to see the look on our neighbours ’ faces			1
last week , a survey revealed that 31 per cent of @entity52 admit , like us , to carrying out home improvements just to ensure their property is the envy of the neighbourhood			1
even when we bought our home for £ 305,000 in 2009 , i made sure we invested in the shabby corner plot because i knew that it had the most potential			1
we had inherited some money and were keen to buy somewhere that would be a good long - term investment — at least , that was my husband ’s main motivation			1
secretly , i could n’t bear to be the anonymous owner of a distinctly average property , indistinguishable from the rest			2
i wanted to live in the most talked - about house in the area			1
but it was n’t going to be easy on our relatively small budget			0
at first , all we could find were formulaic cottages which would be impossible to improve and enlarge			0
then finally , after scouring property websites for months , i found the perfect project			0
before : the old - fashioned kitchen needed to be ripped out and completely remodelled after : @entity0 's kitchen now includes state - of - the - art fittings and the latest , most expensive appliances it was , at the time , a scruffy - looking three - bedroom semi on a noisy main road			1
there had been so little interest in it that the asking price had dropped by £ 100,000 in just six months			1
clearly , the other buyers had been underwhelmed by the worn @entity87 carpets , nicotine stains on the once - cream walls and faded flock wallpaper			1
plus the only toilet was in the kitchen			1
but i had my eye on bigger things			0
i had dreams of property grandeur			0
for a start , this house was on a corner plot , which meant there would be scope for a double - storey side extension			1
there was a 60sq ft garden which could easily take it and the roof was the perfect height to add a loft conversion			1
subject of course to planning permission , this unloved property could be transformed from an ugly duckling of a house into a beautiful swan - like home			1
maybe not quite a mansion of @entity120 proportions , but certainly something to be proud of			0
old fashioned : the house was in a dingy state and was full of retro furniture when the old owner lived there chic : the kitchen and sitting room have been totally revamped with modern furniture and pale walls so we set the wheels in motion and offered even less than the much - reduced asking price			1
' it ’s not really what we were after , ' i told the seller			0
' it needs a total refurb and the damp is horrendous			0
' the seller caved and our offer of £ 305,000 was accepted			1
we moved in and lived in squalor for 12 months while we sorted out all the paperwork			0
during this time i could sense the local sniggers			0
our house was shabby and unloved — just what were we thinking , buying something that nobody wanted ? ' you ’ll need a lot of paint to make that look nice , ' nodded one neighbour as he strolled past to collect his morning paper			1
but i knew i ’d prove him wrong			0
i had n’t spent the last year watching back - to - back episodes of @entity159 and @entity160 for nothing			2
it took three months for our house to be almost demolished and re-built			2
builders stripped the house back to the brickwork , took the roof off , the windows and doors came out and the side and back of the house were knocked off			1
by now i was three months pregnant with our son @entity171 , now two , so we moved into a friend ’s flat round the corner to escape the dust , dirt and constant drilling			0
as new foundations were dug and reams of scaffolding erected the neighbours started to gawp			0
even the roof tiles were removed leaving the wooden beams exposed to the sky			0
elegant : once a poky boxroom , the master bedroom , which has its own ensuite bathroom , is now a pretty , soothing place to sleep @entity189 : the exterior needed a serious paint job but not as much as the dingy interior ' it ’s going to be big , ' speculated one neighbour as she walked past , stopping at my gate to admire the building site			0
' huge , ' i confirmed , enjoying her obvious envy			0
as well as the double - storey extension to the back of the house , brand new walls , windows and roof , we extended our tiny galley kitchen to over 300sq ft of bespoke @entity208 - designed sleek modernity			1
i exploded with pride every time i looked at my luxury @entity212 and freestanding @entity214 double - door refrigerator			2
our tiny box room became the master bedroom with over £ 3,000 worth of fitted wardrobes and a luxury en - suite bathroom			1
no expense was spared on our walk - in @entity222 shower with a monsoon showerhead and @entity225 bathroom suite			2
we had real £ 2,000 oak flooring laid that covered the ground floor and a plush wool striped carpet up the stairs and in each of the three huge bedrooms			2
spacious : the huge garden was one of the reasons why @entity0 and @entity14 thought the house had potential suddenly , we were the talk of the street			1
whenever i opened the door to put the rubbish out , passers - by would crane their necks to get a glimpse inside			2
@entity245 would stop us on the street and make hints about how nice it would be to come round so they could ‘ admire ’ the work			0
and we were always happy to oblige			0
what would be the point of doing £ 150,000 worth of renovation if we were n’t going to show it off ? i ’d even turn on the lights and leave the curtains open at night just so our neighbours could get a glimpse into our fabulous home			1
at @entity260 we were invited to an exclusive drinks soiree held by the most established residents on the street			0
only a chosen few locals were invited and there was no guessing why we had been awarded our place			0
the neighbours could n’t stop themselves asking for every detail of our house renovation			2
' did n’t you go crazy having to deal with all those builders ? ' one of them asked pointedly			0
' your house has been the talk of the playground , ' another commented			2
' we all thought you were mad buying that house , but now			2
' well , if anyone doubted me , they ’re now eating their words , ' i replied haughtily			0
of @entity283 , it ’s not been without sacrifices			0
we ’ve blown all our savings on the house and forgone luxury holidays for wet and windy trips to the @entity289			2
not to mention builders , plumbers and electricians stampeding through our house			2
plus it was n’t easy being pregnant throughout the renovations — my swirling hormones would get in the way of choosing the best bathroom tiles			0
but still i was n’t happy			0
i wanted to do a loft extension , so persuaded my husband to take out a £ 40,000 loan at the beginning of this year			1
the neighbours were incredulous when the second lot of scaffolding went up			0
' more work ? ' they asked			0
' surely there ’s nothing left to do ? ' the bitter tone in their voices rather pleased me			0
i loved the fact we were keeping tongues wagging.now we own the only four - bedroom house on the street and the other properties — a mixture of semi-detached houses and terraced railway properties — are shabby and poky in comparison			1
plus we ’ve increased our house price by £ 350,000			1
one of our neighbours has just put their house up for sale and i could n’t help but wonder whether it was because they were upset about being overshadowed by us			2
one of my friends went to look around and came away saying : ' of course , we could never buy it because any improvements we made would never be as good as yours			2
' i smiled silently , knowing she was absolutely right .			0

@entity0 bought her house in a run - down , near *derelict* state
today , it 's worth £ 350,000 more than they paid for it
improvements include side extension , 300sq ft kitchen and loft conversion
