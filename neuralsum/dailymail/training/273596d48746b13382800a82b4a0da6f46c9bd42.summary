by @entity0 errors in hospital waiting list times have undermined public confidence in the data , claims a public spending watchdog			0
the @entity7 called for independent audits in future after spot checks found one in four hospitals recording false waiting list times			1
it said hospital trusts were ' struggling with a hotchpotch ' of it and paper - based systems that made it difficult to compare their performance			0
one in four hospitals checked were found to be misrecording data on waiting times @entity24 , chair of the @entity7 , said patients are being deprived of choice for example , there were variations on how many cancellations patients were allowed to make of planned surgery before having to go back to their gp which affected when the waiting time ' clock ' was re-started			1
@entity7 chairman @entity24 mp , said ' if patients can not be confident of accurate comparable data on the performance of hospitals they can not exercise choice			1
' both gps and their patients need reliable and comparable information about the waiting time performance of individual trusts so that they can make an informed choice about where to be treated			1
' the committee 's report published today says the @entity50 found records of waiting times riddled with errors			2
spot checks carried out by the @entity50 showed in more than half of cases , hospital trusts were either wrongly recording data about waiting lists or keeping incomplete records			0
dr @entity61 : ' it 's vitally important that information on waiting times is accurate and reliable ' the @entity50 found details were falsely recorded in 26 per cent of the cases examined - most often because @entity69 administrators were ' starting the clock ' at the wrong times , or routinely pausing official waiting times			1
@entity69 targets , introduced by @entity73 in 2008 , state that 90 per cent of patients who need inpatient care and 95 per cent who require outpatient treatment should wait no longer than 18 weeks			1
mrs @entity24 said ' public confidence in the success hospital trusts have had in meeting the 18 week waiting time target is inevitably undermined by errors in trusts ' recording of waiting time information			2
' waiting list data needs to be independently audited			0
' she said the committee was ' sceptical ' about the chances of the new @entity90 - due to replace online @entity91 - being any better used			0
dr @entity61 , chair of the @entity93 council , said ' waiting for an operation or treatment can be a worrying and stressful time for patients , so it 's vitally important that information on waiting times is accurate and reliable			2
' it is also essential so that @entity41 can provide patients with the right information on waiting times , as this can affect where they decide to seek treatment			2
' ministers need to ensure data collection is consistent and reliable			0
however a rise in the number of private providers and the fragmentation of services , resulting from the government 's top down reorganisation , has made this harder , not easier to achieve			0
