an experimental drug given to a seriously ill @entity2 boy after his parents ' high - profile plea to a drugs company is starting to take effect			1
just last week seven - year - old @entity7 was fighting for his life after contracting a virus that was causing internal bleeding , and heart and kidney failure			1
but , after just three doses of @entity14 , which is not yet available on the market , @entity7 is starting to make progress and the virus is leaving his body			1
on the mend : the virus attacking @entity7 's body has nearly gone after just three doses of the new drug relief : @entity7 's family posted this picture of him getting his first dose of the experimental drug as well as the levels of adenovirus falling , the bleeding in the cancer survivor 's stomach and intestines has stopped			1
it is a long way from where he was a week ago , when the seven - year - old could barely speak and was vomiting blood , while his family kept a desperate vigil at his bedside in a @entity44 hospital			0
campaign : @entity47 chief executive @entity46 agreed to make the drug available after a campaign his mother , @entity50 , who campaigned to get drug company @entity47 to give her son their new drug , said : ' i 'm beside myself with how effective this drug was so quickly			1
' she told @entity56 they expect the virus to have left his system by tuesday			0
@entity7 's body , weakened by chemotherapy after he had cancer for the fourth time , was struggling to fight of the adenovirus			1
the only available drugs were not working and @entity47 has refused to give the family access to experimental medication @entity14			1
but , after his family launched a high - profile media campaign , @entity68 relented			1
the company , in return , has been allowed to use data from @entity7 to help its @entity74 application , which could bring the drug on the market earlier			1
@entity47 chief @entity77 announced on tuesday last week that his firm will begin a pilot trial for the drug immediately - with @entity7 as the program 's first patient			1
@entity46 had faced huge criticism for denying the @entity84 boy @entity14 to fight off an infection he developed after a bone marrow transplant			2
in a statement , @entity46 said that after much careful consideration @entity47 would offer @entity7 the medicine			1
' this 20 - patient open - label study underscores @entity47 's mission to develop innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need - for everyone , ' @entity46 said according to @entity95			1
' being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating , and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make			0
' it is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value , a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of @entity14 that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious @entity110 viral infections			2
' survivor : @entity7 has survived four bouts of kidney cancer , heart failure and a bone marrow transplant @entity115 : before getting the drug @entity7 was in intensive care , with his heart and kidneys failing although physically @entity7 's condition has improved , his mom says he appears to have lost his motivation after months of ill health			1
she told @entity56 his once - positive attitude appears to have gone and he appears exhausted			0
' i have n't seen him smile lately , ' she said			0
and , although the virus appears to be going , @entity7 has suffered severe kidney damage after being given other drugs to try to halt the virus			1
he has to have dialysis three times a week and could need it for the rest of his life - something that haunts mrs @entity134			2
' if he could have gotten the @entity14 earlier , it could have been avoided			2
that will always bother me , ' she said			0
the drug has not been approved by the @entity74 , but has previously been administered to hundreds of other patients under a prior ' compassionate use ' allowance			0
fight : @entity134 , pictured with @entity7 , second left , and her other children , campaigned to get access to the experimental treatment hope : @entity7 's family say the virus that was killing him could be gone by next week previously @entity46 said that saying yes to @entity7 would mean saying yes to many more patients , draining the company 's resources and delaying the time it will take for the drug to progress through the formal studies required before it can be given @entity74 approval and help many more future patients			1
however , the company received $ 72 million in federal funding to develop @entity14			2
before she was able to secure the drug for her son , mrs @entity134 said the situation was devastating , especially for a boy who has fought so hard to live			0
' there ’s no good excuse for us , ' she said			0
' there ’s nothing they can say that will really keep us from asking			0
we ’re begging them to give it to us			0
' @entity7 's doctors also contacted @entity174 requesting their patient be allowed to have the drug			2
@entity7 was diagnosed with cancer of the kidneys in 2007			2
since then , he has battled the disease four times			0
he had been in remission for two years when a bone scan in november of 2013 revealed he had developed a bone marrow disorder due to earlier cancer treatments			0
in january of this year he had a bone marrow transplant and endured another round of chemotherapy at @entity189 's @entity188 in @entity44			0
following the successful surgery he developed adenovirus , an infection that can be deadly in people with weakened immune systems			0
exhausted : although the virus looks like it is going away , @entity7 's mom says the seven - year - old has lost his spark ' normally , @entity7 ’s immune system would be able to handle the adenovirus if his immune system was set free , ' mrs @entity134 wrote on her son ’s @entity203 page			1
' the challenge is his immune system ca n’t be set free yet because his body is still trying to adapt to the new bone marrow cells			0
so to keep the body from killing the new cells , they have to suppress the immune system , thus creating ideal conditions for adenovirus to advance			0
' @entity14 has been shown to clear up adenovirus in children in two weeks , reports @entity216 .			2
