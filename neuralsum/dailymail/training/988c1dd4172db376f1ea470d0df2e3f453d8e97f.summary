by @entity0 published : 12:06 est , 31 march 2013 updated : 12:06 est , 31 march 2013 this is the first view inside the most gruesome building at a notorious boys reform school in @entity4			1
the mausoleum - like building known as the ' @entity7 ' at the @entity8 housed nine barren cubicles where boys accused of rule breaking were held			1
cameras were briefly given access before the whole site is declared a crime scene and they captured a series of chilling and eerie images			2
@entity39 showed disturbing footage from inside the prison - like building			1
one room has a bloody handprint smeared on the painted walls and a number of other stains			2
another room has haunting graffiti with the names of boys who were interred in the school			1
one marking has the name @entity53 and an unexplained note of ' 19 times ' the school was legend among adolescents for about 100 years in @entity4 , as the state 's major reform school , until it was closed in 2011			1
abuse : former students spoke out several years ago with horror stories of sexual abuse and frequent beatings in cells at the @entity7 reminders : one room has several stains from earlier times victims : boys that were held at the @entity73 school left their mark behind bodies discovered in a once - secret graveyard at the reform school could be now be dug up after calls for federal funding for a forensic investigation into the site			1
dozens of unmarked graves have been found on the property after years of allegations of abuse and children dying in mysterious circumstances			1
soon investigators could digging up that past			0
investigators are trying to determine the circumstances surrounding the deaths , which experts say probably occurred between 1914 and 1952			0
state officials have for years insisted that 31 boys were interred in a tiny cemetery on the grounds of the notorious reform school			1
horrors : crosses mark graves at a cemetery at @entity8 for boys in @entity38 , @entity4			1
investigators have said they had found at least 50 graves on the grounds scene : former students spoke out several years ago with horror stories of sexual abuse and frequent beatings in this mausoleum - like building dubbed the ' @entity7 ' investigation : researchers believe that 96 boys died at the school and expect to find more burial sites but now , using high - tech search equipment , forensic scientists have already found evidence of at least another 19 bodies buried under the site - and fear there could be many more			1
' we really do n't know exactly how many , or who they are , ' said @entity128 , a forensic anthropologist at the @entity129			1
she has a scroll - like map of spots around the school 's grounds where her ground - piercing radar has spotted evidence of human remains			1
some boys died under unknown circumstances , according to relatives			2
institution : @entity73 was opened as a state reform school in january 1900 for misbehaving boys treatment : the boys were allegedly forced into hard labour , while others were beaten , raped or killed culture : a memorial or burial service around 1950			1
more than 20 students ' burials were undocumented in december , researchers from the @entity129 in @entity154 said they found evidence of at least 50 graves on the school 's property			1
in 2009 , writer @entity159 published the @entity160 detailing the horrors he experienced while incarcerated at @entity8			2
he was sent to the reform school in 1959 when he was 12 , and suffered brutal , bloody beatings in the infamous @entity7 building			1
' little did i know that @entity166 had its own concentration camp for little boys right here in the good ole @entity166 , ' he wrote			2
' a devil was hiding behind every tree , every building and even behind every blade of manicured grass			2
' he writes on his website : ' the terrible screams i heard and the brutal beatings i witnessed as a 12 year old will remain in my memory forever			0
' the beatings i suffered are not my horrors today			0
my horrors are the beatings of crying boys that i had to witness before my own beatings			2
the horror of knowing that i was next			0
' the thick concrete walls and the loud industrial fan easily muffled the horrible screams of the boys as they were beaten bloody			2
some were carried to the hospital in wheelbarrows and some had to have their underwear or pajamas surgically removed from the buttocks			0
' for almost thirty minutes , at age sixty - two , i stood alone in the exact room where i was almost beaten to death			0
with my heart racing and the side of my neck pulsating , i lit a cigarette and i cried without feeling shame			0
' they also found more grave shafts in and around an area called ' @entity206 ' , which rises across a major highway from the high , razor - wire - topped fences of the closed school			1
there could be even more victims , but researchers do not have access to records after 1960 because of privacy laws , and overgrowth on the grounds has hindered them from full searches			0
dr @entity128 said : ' all the focus on exact numbers is not really the issue			0
' whether it 's one or 20 or 40 or 60 , we are talking about a child and families that are asking for information			0
' @entity8 was closed in june 2011 by the @entity228 after a years - long controversy over widespread physical and sexual abuse			1
previous investigations and lawsuits have been brought by the ' @entity8 ' - so called because of the name of the squat , whitewashed building where much of the abuse took place			1
a group of former students sued the state in 2010 , but their case was dismissed as the statute of limitations had expired			0
other students have written books about their experiences			0
following the claims , researchers at the @entity129 in @entity154 used ground - penetrating radar and soil samples and now believe there are many more bodies buried there than previously reported			1
the largest gravesite is on the northside of the campus , where @entity258 boys were buried			0
it is at this site where the 31 graves are marked with white crosses , but researchers believe they do not correspond with actual burial sites			1
' we anticipated finding about 25 to 30 grave shafts , ' said @entity266 , an assistant professor of anthropology who led the anthropological work at the site			0
' but in fact we found a minimum of 50			0
' discovery : @entity129 radar research shows burial sites do not correspond with the crosses @entity73 's own records show that more than 50 children were buried on the grounds , while more than 30 other bodies were sent elsewhere to be buried			2
but the school failed to record burial locations for 22 other children who researchers learned died on the site , the @entity279 reported in december			2
some of the children - and two adults - died in a fire and influenza outbreak in the early 1900s , while others were reported to have suffered from ill health or physical traumas @entity4 attorney general @entity293 and other state officials are now seeking a court order to allow the remains to be exhumed			1
the @entity166 @entity297 has a programme that could provide up to $ 3million for a thorough forensic sifting of the burial areas , said @entity166 senator @entity301 , a @entity302 , who toured the site yesterday			2
a $ 200,000 appropriation is already pending in the state legislature			0
school grounds : scientists believe there are bodies buried in wooded areas and unmarked graves ongoing : the @entity166 @entity297 has a programme that could provide up to $ 3million for a thorough forensic sifting of the burial areas , said @entity166 senator @entity301 , a @entity302 mr @entity301 said he wants to find out as much as possible and let relatives know the truth			1
he noted that ' the statute of limitation on murder never runs out , ' but added there is little chance of prosecuting anyone			0
state attorney @entity323 said only one or two employees from the era are known to be alive , and it 's unlikely a trial could prove how a boy died or who was responsible			0
' the question is , can we establish probable cause that a crime has been committed , and who did it ? ' he said			0
' that 's the hard part			0
' families could ask their legislators to file ' claims ' bills for civil compensation , if identity could be established from remains and if negligence might be established on the part of the state			0

@entity8 opened as a reform school in 1900 but was closed in 2011 amid decades - long allegations of physical and sexual abuse
