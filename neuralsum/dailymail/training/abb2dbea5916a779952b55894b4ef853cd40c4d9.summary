the @entity1 tv tender sent out to broadcasters on friday - which includes some friday night games - is set to take the cost of a live @entity1 fixture to the stratospheric height of £ 10million a match from the start of 2016 - 17			1
the addition of 14 extra live games per season - stripped from the ‘ protected ’ saturday 3pm kick - offs - will bring in another £ 140m , taking the monies from the @entity1 ’s domestic contract over three years close to £ 5billion			1
the current deal values a @entity1 match at £ 6.7m			1
even with a 50 per cent increase compared to the 72 per cent rise at the last auction , the £ 10m - per - match figure is easily attainable - especially as arch rivals @entity22 and @entity23 will both break the bank for the rights to 168 games			1
@entity1 matches could soon be shown on a friday night - 168 matches will be available to be shown live from 2016 - 14 more than currently			1
- up to 10 of those matches will be shown live on friday evenings			1
- the 168 games will be split into seven packages - five of 28 matches and two packages of 14 matches			1
no single buyer will be allowed to acquire more than five packages or 126 matches			2
- the @entity37 will include an auction for a free - to - air highlights package , held by the @entity41 's @entity40 since 2004			2
- the current total value of the domestic broadcast rights deals is £ 3.018billion over three years			1
- an announcement on the 2016 - 19 rights is expected by early march			1
- a later auction will take place for 212 ' near - live ' matches to be accessed on - demand , and for internet - based clips			2
- the @entity37 will protect the saturday 3pm ' closed period ' where games kicking off then are not shown live			1
most of the 14 extra games - though fewer than 10 - will be played on friday nights			1
and the matches will be offered for sale in a beefed - up 28 - game package with monday night football			2
the four other 28 - game sets are for saturday and sunday tv slots , while there are two 14 - game packages consisting of midweek and @entity64 fixtures			2
but even the smaller packages remain way beyond terrestrial tv ’s reach			1
@entity22 , having seen @entity23 grab their @entity69 portfolio , need to win at least four of the five super packages to retain their dominant position			0
@entity72 are sure to bid for the highlights contract , even though that format seems to have a much better fit on @entity40			0
as the @entity41 will prioritise retaining their @entity40 content , the @entity1 can anticipate another huge rise on the current £ 180m deal			1
@entity79 have the rights to 116 games this season , and than number could go up with the new deal @entity23 caused a shock with the previous deal when they paid almost £ 6.5m per game in 2013 @entity88 , chairman of the @entity1 nominations panel , is understood to be the influential voice most in favour of promoting ceo @entity92 to executive chairman			1
and @entity88 will have a good sixth sense as to when best to bring that recommendation to the 20 clubs			0
@entity88 ( right ) is understood to be in favour of promoting ceo @entity92 @entity98 's @entity97 is a virtual certainty to be elected by @entity100 as the @entity102 vice-president of @entity103 , having made a u-turn to stand following pressure from @entity100 president @entity106			0
but he is still expected to face competition from @entity108 and @entity109			0
@entity108 @entity111 president @entity110 has yet to decide but is highly likely to put his name forward , while @entity113 , president of the @entity111 , is already writing an election manifesto stressing his grass - roots football background			0
but certainly when @entity116 ( above ) takes his inevitable place on the @entity103 executive , he will have to start dealing with the media , which currently he prefers to ignore			0
@entity98 's @entity97 is a virtual certainty to be elected by @entity100 as the @entity102 vice-president of @entity103 @entity122 , deputy general secretary of the crisis - hit @entity123 , has bizarrely hit out at journalists for writing stories about his beleaguered organisation rather than sort out a mess that includes legal adviser @entity129 - apparently implicated by @entity131 tv in the cover - up of serial @entity134 doping - refusing to stand down as a consultant despite being told to do so			2
@entity122 , rather than return calls , chose to write a letter to little - known @entity139 website @entity140 in which he complained about the newspaper reports that a well - known @entity102 star was on a list of 150 athletes with suspiciously high blood count levels who were said not to have been target tested			0
but @entity122 wrote himself : ‘ athletes with a red flag reading may well be guilty of doping			0
’ @entity151 spat with @entity23 former @entity152 manager @entity151 wanted to return his broadcast fee to @entity23 and asked for their interview with him to be taken out of the network ’s @entity156 documentary			0
@entity151 has led protests about the @entity23 programme , to be aired on @entity160 , since being shown a preview last week			2
@entity151 ( right ) wanted to return his broadcast fee to @entity23 and asked for their interview with him to be taken out of the network ’s @entity156 documentary he took @entity152 through the divisions to the top flight , yet @entity23 , who have focused on the 1988 @entity167 - winning side managed by @entity168 , believe that @entity151 is upset at not being one of the central figures in the film			0
station chiefs say the terms and conditions @entity151 signed allow them to use all the footage he was involved in			0
@entity151 said : ‘ i did n’t want anything to do with the documentary , having seen it			0
but i ’m told i signed a disclaimer so i can do nothing about it			0
they certainly paid me in record time			0
