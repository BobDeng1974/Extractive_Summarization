@entity0 , the authority responsible for determining what hue will prove most popular in the coming year , has announced its color of 2015 : @entity4			1
and while the @entity8 - based company has been happily singing the praises of the ' hardy , robust ' red shade , the wine - inspired tone has already come under some serious fire from critics who have described it as ' boring ' , ' horrendous ' and ' just plain awful '			1
' really , @entity0 ? that color looks like the vomit you might have after eating a bad chicken @entity4 , ' @entity18 user @entity17 proclaimed , while @entity20 said : ' @entity4 just is n't exciting			1
' @entity42 , robust , satisfying , fulfilling , ' she said of the shade			1
' at the same time there 's a certain glamour that 's attached to this color			1
' @entity0 's yearly color pick often serves as a good indication of what shades to expect in the coming year from fashion , beauty , housewares , home and industrial design and consumer packaging , though some years the influence is stronger than others			2
the 2014 color of the year from the forecasters and industry consultants was @entity21 , a deep tropical purple			2
the year before that it was emerald green , while @entity66 was the pick of 2012			0
the idea , @entity37 explained in a recent interview , is not to choose a color that will necessarily ' overtake the world ' , but rather one that will leave a lasting impression on a wide variety of industries			2
@entity37 and her team travel the world to observe color at play			2
they see @entity4 being used in any number of ways , be it an accent wall in a living room or office , a swipe of eye shadow mixed with bronze for a metallic look , a throw pillow , the exterior of a car , or a bit of jewelry evoking the 1950s			0
beauty trends : @entity98 announced that it will be releasing a make - up collection inspired by @entity4 from cars to carpets : @entity0 's yearly color picks influence all manner of industry , from fashion and beauty to industrial design and homewares ' it really does embody a certain amount of confidence and stability , ' @entity37 added			1
the hue is n't a risky one and the @entity0 team believe it will work , whether in a nail polish , a frock on a runway or a pattern of stripes in a men 's tie or florals for table placemats or bedding			0
@entity37 noted the versatile shade was among colors @entity0 flagged as spring / summer trends for 2015 earlier this year , as evidenced on the runways of @entity129 by @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 , among other designers			1
as they did with @entity21 , cosmetics favorite @entity98 has already announced the launch of a limited - edition collection of beauty products based on @entity0 and its latest pick			1
@entity37 added that @entity4 has been widely used in lipstick and hair color for years			0
one of the color 's strengths , she said , is the ease in combining it with gray , black , beige and other neutrals			0
' it 's a color that you can mix with what you already own , ' she explained			0
' you can add just a touch of it			0
that 's the intent and purpose			0
it is not the color that swallows the world			0

the color authority announced the debut of the red - brown hue earlier today
while the company insists the shade is ' hardy , robust ' and even glamorous , many *people* have taken to @entity18 to blast it as ' boring '
