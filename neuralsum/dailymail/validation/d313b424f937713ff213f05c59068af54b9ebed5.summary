a woman who described herself as a ' good girl ' and had been married to the same man for 17 years has spoken about her ' year off ' trying an open marriage			1
writer @entity4 , now 50 , slept with ten men and two women during her year of promiscuity in 2008 , but is now divorced from her husband			1
appearing on @entity10 's @entity9 , @entity4 opened up about her unorthodox decision , which she says was triggered by her husband 's vasectomy			1
' i would say before the year i was in a somewhat inhibited but satisfied , normal loving relationship , ' she said of her 17 year marriage to @entity29 , a brewer and wine - maker			1
' but when i got into my early 40s my husband got a vasectomy and i knew the discussion of having a baby was over , which kick - started this experience , ' she explained			2
' i looked forward to my death bed and thought			0
" what will i have ? " i wo n’t have children and grandchildren			0
will i at least have lived fully ? " ' ' if i could n’t have one i wanted the other , ' she explained			0
' like a lot of women at that age i was hitting my confidence and sexual peak and suddenly realised very dramatically that i was n’t going to have children			0
it was the perfect storm			0
@entity51 said having ' very little sexual variety ' in her youth was a motivating factor , as the fact that she was living in @entity56 , which she described as ' a very liberal city ' ' wild oats ' : @entity4 , 50 , negotiated an open marriage with her husband of 17 years , which allowed her to bed 12 strangers in 12 months - which ultimately broke her relationship ' i have had lots of people telling me i should have travelled the world , tried painting classes or cooking – but i already know how to cook ! ' she also said having ' very little sexual variety ' in her youth was a motivating factor , as the fact that she was living in @entity56 , which she described as ' a very liberal city '			1
' i was also at a marital crisis and was thinking about trying a partial separation , ' she said			0
' so i thought ok whilst we do that i need to sow some wild oats and let him do the same			0
' under the terms of her new deal , @entity4 took out an apartment , where she lived from monday to friday and would bed her conquests			1
but over the weekend she would go back to @entity81 , and the two would live as a married couple , without asking what the other had been doing while they were apart			2
' the ground rules were safe sex , not to get seriously involved with anyone and to refrain from mutual acquaintances , ' she explained			2
' but at the end of the year , we each broke two rules			2
' to find willing participants in her project @entity4 decided not to pick up men at bars , but to be more strategic in her search			1
' i was a very busy magazine editor working long hours and never in my life had i picked up a man at a bar or had a one night stand , ' she explains			0
' so i felt like going about it in a more clear - headed , conscious way			0
' @entity4 posted an online ad , entitled @entity105			1
in the post , she wrote : ' i 'm a 44 - year - old professional , educated , attractive woman in an open marriage , seeking single men age 35 - 50 to help me explore my sexuality			1
' ' i said i wanted to meet in public for dinner and drinks			0
i explained that if it led to sex then great , but that i could n’t get seriously involved or see them more than a few times			2
' the next day , @entity4 had 23 offers and over the course of the year had 12 sexual partners , including two women			1
struggle : @entity4 said her husband , @entity29 , right , was loving and dependable - but did not share her desire to have children , driving her to want lovers instead so would she advise it ? ‘ not if you want to stay married , ' she told @entity9 hosts @entity130 and @entity131			1
' read my book instead and have an armchair adventure			0
' ' i was well aware it would be very risky – but i did n’t think we had that much to lose			0
' this 5:2 idea of weekends together and weekdays apart was to put a bit of distance between us to see each other in a new light and add some sparkle			0
' that happened at first , ' she said , but admitted their sexual exploits ended up pushing them apart			0
account : @entity4 describes every step of the ' project ' in intimate detail in her newly - released book , @entity154 ' it was hard to put it all back in the box , ' she exlained			1
@entity4 , who made the life - changing decision to pursue sex with other people in 2008 , has written a book about her exploits called @entity154			1
in the book she describes her relationship with @entity81 , a brewer and wine - maker , as ' stuck in a rut ' , adding that ' our once - a - week sex life was loving , but lacked spontaneity and passion '			2
recounting her exploits in her book , @entity4 described her first encounter with a 40 - year - old lawyer , whom she bedded in her apartment on the second date : ' we stumbled to the bed , where he turned me onto my hands and knees and took me from behind			1
' we had intercourse twice and , after he left , i felt satiated			0
' she later moved on to much younger men , and described texting her husband goodnight from a @entity188 hotel room moments after a 23 - year - old paramour left the room			1
two of her 12 encounters were with women , one of which was a threesome			2
describing another encounter , she writes explicitly about taking a new - found pleasure in fellatio			0
however , after the raucous year , @entity4 admitted , she could not turn back			1
attempts to rekindle their marriage after the year failed - and @entity4 began sleeping with one of the men from the past year , whom she refers to by a pseudonym			1
she wrote : ' the turning point was hearing from @entity207			0
he sent me an e-mail , out of the blue , several months after the project had come to an end			2
' before long , we were having sex again			2
being with him was exquisite			0
after reconnecting with @entity207 and falling deeply in love with him , there was no going back			2
' @entity219 : after @entity4 's year of uninhibited encounters , she was unable to rekindle her loving marriage with @entity81 , and the two now have different partners @entity4 has now lived with ' @entity207 ' for five years in a monogamous relationship , while @entity81 has also moved on			1
the former couple now consider themselves at peace - and @entity81 was even happy with her writing the book , detailing every aspect of their sex lives and her previously secret exploits with other men			1
speaking to the @entity233 about how he responded to the book , she said : ' his response was , " you have to write it			0
if you write it well , it wo n’t really be about us , it will be about lots of marriages			0
