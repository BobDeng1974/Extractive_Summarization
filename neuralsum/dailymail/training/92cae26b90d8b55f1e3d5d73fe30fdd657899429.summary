by @entity0 fossils of a 410 million - year - old arachnid - one of the first predators on land - have been used to recreate what the animal might have looked like when walking			1
researchers used exceptionally preserved fossils from the @entity9 in @entity10 to create the animation			2
and in so doing they managed to show the most likely walking gait of the animal , which was thought to be only a few millimetres long			2
scroll down for animation more than 400 million years after it became extinct , scientists have recreated one of the planet 's earliest predators			1
researchers at the @entity20 and the @entity21 in @entity22 used @entity23 to recreate the walk of a now extinct ancestor of the spider			1
illustration pictured the study was published in the @entity29 and carried out by @entity20 and the @entity21 in @entity22			1
the scientists used the fossils - thin slices of rock showing the animal 's cross-section - to work out the range of motion in the limbs of this ancient , extinct early relative of the spiders			1
this arachnid , @entity41 , was part of a spider - like group known as @entity47 ( type ) @entity45			0
these were spider - like animals that roamed @entity50 and @entity51 , as well as @entity52 , from around 419 and 290 million years ago			1
they ranged in size from a few millimetres to a few centimetres in body length			0
most were predators , and later species were heavily armoured			0
from this , and comparisons to living arachnids , the researchers used an open source computer graphic program called @entity64 to create the video showing the animals walking			2
this particular arachnid was known as @entity68 of the extinct @entity45 that roamed from around 419 and 290 million years ago			1
' when it comes to early life on land , long before our ancestors came out of the sea , these early arachnids were top dog of the food chain , ' said author dr @entity78 , a palaeontologist in the @entity20 's @entity79			2
' they are now extinct but , from about 300 to 400 million years ago , seem to have been more widespread than spiders			1
' now we can use the tools of computer graphics to better understand and recreate how they might have moved - all from thin slivers of rock , showing the joints in their legs			0
' the scientists used the fossils to work out the range of motion in the limbs of this ancient , extinct early relative of the spiders			2
from this , and comparisons to living arachnids , the researchers used an open source computer graphic program called @entity64 to create the video showing the animals walking in the animation above these eight - legged creatures were one of the earliest to walk the land , dominating the food chain while the ancestors of humans were still swimming in the primeval swamp			1
pictured is an x-ray of the 410 million - year - old arachnid fossil from @entity10 's @entity9 co-author dr @entity115 , a curator at the @entity21 , @entity22 , said : ' these fossils - from a rock called the @entity118 - are unusually well - preserved			1
' during my phd i could build up a pretty good idea of their appearance in life			0
this new study has gone further and shows us how they probably walked			0
' for me , what 's really exciting here is that scientists themselves can make these animations now , without needing the technical wizardry - and immense costs - of a @entity136 - style film			0
' when i started working on fossil arachnids we were happy if we could manage a sketch of what they used to look like ; now we can view them running across our computer screens			0
' this work is part of a special collection of papers on three - dimensional visualisation and analysis of fossils published			0
dr @entity78 added : ' using open - source software means that this is something anyone could do at home , while allowing us to understand these early land animals better than ever before			0
' pictured here are a sequence of images from the video showing how the arachnid walked			2

researchers from @entity20 and @entity22 have brought an arachnid to ' life '
the extinct animal was one of the first predators to walk on land
a video was recreated from fossils of the 410 million - year - old creature called @entity68 , which was a few millimetres in length
this shows how the *critter* was *believed* to have walked on the ground
around 300 to 400 million years ago , the creatures were thought to have been more widespread than spiders
