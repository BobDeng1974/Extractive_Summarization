by @entity1 reporter published : 03:00 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 05:52 est , 14 march 2013 @entity2 was today officially appointed as president of @entity4 , sealing his position as the most powerful man in the world 's largest country			1
the new leader , who has taken over from @entity10 , will be charged with promoting the ' @entity11 ' which will propel hundreds of millions of @entity4 's citizens into the middle class over the coming decades			1
the ruling @entity14 hopes that @entity4 's growing economic will help it become more powerful than the @entity15 , with some analysts predicting that the country will overtake the @entity18 and @entity19 by 2030			1
since coming to prominence last year , @entity2 has made a point of spending time with poor @entity4 in an attempt to reassure them that they will share in the country 's growth and enter the middle class			1
' i 'm very happy			0
with president @entity2 leading us , @entity4 will be more prosperous and more powerful , ' said @entity49 , one of the 3,000 delegates to the @entity51 in @entity52			1
though @entity2 , 59 , is now formally in charge , big challenges remain for him within the party 's top ranks - in which powerful people are often divided by patronage , ideology or financial interests			1
he has pledged to tackle the endemic graft which he says is detrimental to the party 's survival , according to @entity65 , a @entity4 politics watcher at the @entity67			1
new president : @entity2 , right , has taken over as @entity4 's top leader from @entity10 , left take a bow : the new president acknowledges delegates to the congress after his election handover : @entity2 is taking power at a crucial period for the global superpower new boss : @entity2 walks to the stage to cast his vote in the presidential election which he won @entity2 , the most powerful man in @entity4 , is a 59 - year - old @entity14 loyalist and son of a famous revolutionary leader			1
he was born in 1953 to @entity84 , a political leader who helped overthrow @entity4 's government in 1949 and later held a number of senior positions			1
@entity2 grew up in @entity52 and studied chemical engineering at @entity89 , joining the @entity14 at the age of 21			2
as is customary , he spent many years as a party official in various provincial areas - but also visited a small town in @entity94 to research @entity18 agriculture			0
@entity2 's big breakthrough came in 2000 when he was appointed governor of @entity99 province , subsequently becoming party chief in @entity101 and then @entity102			0
in 2007 he was appointed to the all - powerful @entity103 , and became vice-president the next year , putting him first in line to take the top job during the handover of power to the next generation which took place last november			2
graft is deeply ingrained in the party 's patronage - based culture and those at the top - many of whose families have benefited from their political connections - are believed to be most resistant to anti-corruption measures that diminish their prerogatives			2
' he has to walk a fine line , ' @entity65 said			0
' if he were really serious about going after senior cadres , he might establish his authority within the rank and file			0
however , that would also jeopardize his relationship with the power blocs and with the holders of vested interests			0
' @entity2 's accession marks only the second orderly transfer of power in more than six decades of @entity14 rule			1
he was the only candidate for president in thursday 's ballot in the country 's figurehead parliament			2
the delegates voted 2,952 - to - 1 for @entity2 in a political ritual designed to echo the views of the party leadership			0
after the result was announced , @entity2 bowed to delegates and turned to @entity10 , seated next to him			2
the two of them shook hands and posed for photos			0
@entity2 , the son of a veteran political leader instrumental in the progress of @entity4 's revolution , was also appointed chairman of the government commission that oversees the military			1
@entity156 , a liberal - minded reformer and a close ally of @entity10 , was named vice-president			2
controversially , @entity35 is not in the party 's seven - member ruling inner sanctum			0
@entity2 takes charge at a time when the public is looking for leadership to address sputtering economic growth and mounting anger over widespread graft , high - handed officialdom and increasing unfairness			0
a growth - at - all - costs model that defined the outgoing administration 's era has polluted the country 's air , waterways and soil , adding another serious threat to social stability			2
spectacle : the handover of power came at a meeting of the @entity51 in @entity52 spectacle : but the @entity51 largely exists to rubber - stamp leaders ' decisions voting : delegates examine their ballot papers , an unusual sight in the undemocratic state setting the scene : a hostess arranges @entity2 's seat before the start of thursday 's session ' at present , the party and the government have very little public credibility , ' said @entity199 , a @entity4 politics expert at the prestigious @entity200 in @entity52			1
' the way to regain credibility is to at least show some results , but at this point that ca n't be seen and i predict there wo n't be any real results later			0
' ahead of the votes on the government 's top slots , legislators approved a government restructuring plan only four days after it was introduced			0
among other things , the plan abolishes the @entity215 and combines two agencies that regulate newspapers and broadcasters into a super media regulator			0
it also merges the @entity221 with the commission that oversees the one - child law			0
in a reflection of @entity4 's growing international engagement , the role of president has evolved since the 1990s from being purely ceremonial to a position which lends legitimacy to the government and draws attention away from the @entity14			1
' as @entity4 opens up and becomes more engaged in the international community , it 's just impractical , it 's not convenient , for a party head to meet a foreign head of state , ' said @entity236 , an expert on @entity14 history at @entity238 in @entity239			1
colourful : an ethnic minority delegate in traditional dress casts her vote for president standing out : ethnic minorities are invited to the congress in large numbers to emphasise @entity4 's diversity arriving : female delegates from @entity250 as they entered the @entity251 on thursday @entity2 effectively became the country 's top leader in mid-november after ascending to the helm of the ruling @entity14 , which holds ultimate power in @entity4			1
the son of a revolutionary veteran , @entity2 cuts an authoritative figure with a confidence and congeniality that was lacking in his predecessor , the aloof and stiff @entity10			0
he quickly moved to court the military after taking over from @entity10 as head of the party 's @entity264 , making high - profile visits to naval , air force and infantry bases			1
@entity2 has also sought to please other constituencies			0
he made a trip to the south to show he 's interested in economic reforms , repeatedly stated his staunch belief in party power to appeal to hardliners , visited the poor to burnish his common - man credentials and espoused the ' @entity11 ' to tap into middle class aspirations			2
but for @entity2 to consolidate his power within the party , he will come up against various interest groups such as the sons and daughters of communist @entity4 's founding fathers who want to keep benefiting from their connections , or those with links to banks and state industries who do n't want their privileged positions threatened			1
ideologically , there are those who believe @entity4 needs an even stronger , more authoritarian government that promotes more egalitarian economic and social policies			0
others want a transition to more democratic government .			0

59 - year - old takes over from @entity10 as @entity4 's head of state
elected by delegates at rubber - stamp parliament with only one vote against
already held *supreme* power over country as head of @entity14
