a disabled pensioner claims she has been banned from using the @entity2 ’s home delivery service after describing one of their drivers as a ‘ coloured gentleman ’			1
@entity7 , 73 , says she used the term entirely innocently to refer to a ‘ lovely ’ deliveryman who works for the supermarket			1
but she says a manager at @entity2 ’s immediately branded her a racist for saying the word and said her custom was no longer welcome			2
osteoporosis sufferer @entity7 , 73 , claims she has been banned from using the @entity2 's home delivery service after describing one of their drivers as a ' coloured gentleman ' last night the supermarket insisted the ban was justified and accused mrs @entity7 of using a ‘ racial slur ’ on three separate occasions while being aggressive towards staff			1
but wheelchair - bound mrs @entity7 , who has a @entity25 carer , strenuously denied the charge and said @entity2 ’s should be ashamed of its actions			1
mrs @entity7 , who suffers from osteoporosis and can not leave the house , says she is completely dependent on the delivery service for her £ 80 weekly shop			1
being unfamiliar with computers means online delivery is not an option , so for the last ten years she has phoned the supermarket with her shopping list of food and household goods			0
after a string of mistakes in recent weeks with deliveries arriving without several essentials , she called the shop to inform them of their error			0
she recalled : ‘ when the manager asked me what the name of the delivery driver was , i had to tell him that i did n’t know			0
i said to him , “ i do n’t know his name , but he was a lovely coloured gentleman ”			0
’ she continued : ‘ then all hell broke loose			0
the man on the other end of the phone called me a racist , and said they would never again take an order from me			0
’ last night a @entity2 ’s spokesman claimed the company ’s ban came after mrs @entity7 had been ‘ aggressive ’ and used ‘ racial slurs ’			1
he said : ' mrs @entity7 's version of events does not reflect our experience of her			1
she was not solely banned for the use of the word ' coloured ' but for a range of racial slurs on three separate occasions , used in an aggressive manner against our colleagues			2
mrs @entity7 says she is completely dependent on the delivery service from the @entity78 branch ( above ) for her £ 80 weekly shop ' as you would expect we do n't take action like this lightly but have a duty of care to protect our colleagues from racial and abusive language and any form of aggression			1
' but mrs @entity7 denied the firm ’s version of events , saying : ‘ that ’s absolute lies			2
how dare they call me a racist ? they should be ashamed			0
’ last night one of mrs @entity7 ’s two carers said : ‘ i heard the phone call			1
she was not rude and she was not racist at all			0
’ the @entity2 ’s telephone ordering service – which is not offered by her other local supermarkets – had previously been a lifeline for mrs @entity7 , who is separated and does not have children			1
she says she wept after the staff member ’s outburst earlier this month and is now relying on a friend who lives nearby for her shopping needs			0
she said : ‘ there ’s not a racist bone in my body			0
what ’s wrong with referring to someone as coloured ? it ’s political correctness gone mad			0
’ the retired secretary , who lives in @entity113 , @entity114 , was dependent on her weekly delivery from the nearby @entity78 branch which processed her order from a call centre – although not always correctly			1
‘ they were always forgetting things , and it ’s so hard for me to get out , ’ said mrs @entity7			1
‘ also , the delivery costs me nearly £ 10 , so i felt that i was n’t getting the service i deserved			2
’ she went on : ‘ as a loyal customer , i had had enough , so i rang my local store , not to shout at them or anything , but because i wanted to tell them that i ’m very frail and if they could try to remember everything i order , i ’d be very grateful			0
‘ @entity2 ’s was my lifeline , and now it ’s been taken away from me			2
’ using the term ‘ coloured ’ to refer to black people is considered to be offensive because it dismisses everyone who is not white as the same			2
the term was in widespread use in @entity137 in the 1960s but is now viewed by many to be racist .			0
