in its heyday the @entity9 reservoir had stored up to 300,000 gallons of water and by the time it was decommissioned in 1992 was one of last surviving examples of its type of construction			1
but despite the site 's history and a failed campaign to raise £ 400,000 to keep it open the @entity23 reservoir is drying out for good and is facing demolition to make way for 14 new homes			1
decommissioned : the undergound @entity28 reservoir at @entity29 , @entity30 provided drinking water to the public for 108 years but will now be demolished to make way for new homes battle : campaigners have not been able to raise money to preserve the reservoir and have failed in applications for it to be made a listed building last chance : developers @entity43 have opened up the reservoir for guided tours so that members of the public can see the site before it disappears developers are currently holding guided tours of the reservoir at @entity29 near @entity53 , @entity30 , so that enthusiasts can marvel at its history before it disappears forever			1
historian @entity58 , who has written a commemorative booklet on the reservoir , described its hauntingly beautiful tunnels as ' like being in the hall of the mountain king '			0
he said : ' this is a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity and i ’m sure people will be interested in a unique underground experience and say goodbye to the reservoir which began supplying pure drinking water to the community in 1884			2

when work at the site began a special ceremony was held to lay the foundation stone but there was little above ground to show that it even existed industrial : the reservoir originally used a steam pump to lift water from a large diameter well , approximately 25 meters deep , and pumped it into the reservoir where it fed drinking water to @entity92 through a cast iron pipe unknown quantity : until now few people have stepped inside the reservoir , which was decommissioned 21 years ago ' few people have seen inside			1

the reservoir originally used a steam pump to lift water from a large diameter well , approximately 25 meters deep , and pumped it into the reservoir where it then fed drinking water to @entity92 through a cast iron waterpipe			2
subsequently a much deeper bore hole was sunk below the bottom of the well , and a submersible electric pump used to extract water - making the steam pump redundant			0
the bore hole was used occasionally as an emergency backup and to prevent the brickwork from drying out			0

the body , which advises of the care of historical sites , said it does not fulfil the criteria for national recognition as it is ' neither a rare nor an exceptional example of its type '			0
@entity132 and @entity133 tried unsuccessfully to save parts of the reservoir for posterity			0
the society said that as a piece of industrial archaeology , the site was a ' unique piece of our heritage as it is the oldest and last surviving example of a brick vaulted underground reservoir construction in the area '			1

@entity200 , a member of the @entity201 and @entity133 , said : ' at first we were very disappointed because we could n’t get the funding , but we ’re very pleased it ’s being made available for the community to see , especially the children			0
' @entity183 , from developers @entity43 , said it would be open for guided tours for two weeks			1
he said : ' we felt it was important to open it to the local community to give them the opportunity to come and have a look at the archaeology and the history			0
' a spokesman for @entity43 added : ' @entity43 have been working closely with the local archaeological society to develop a commercially viable option to retain the reservoir at @entity29			0
' due to a lack of funding this was unfortunately unsuccessful			0
before any redevelopment @entity43 would like to open the reservoir to the local community and schools to give people the opportunity to view it and appreciate the @entity23 architecture			1
