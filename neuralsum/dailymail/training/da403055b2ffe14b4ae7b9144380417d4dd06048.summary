sales spike : @entity27 's revelation that she chose to have a double mastectomy because she had a genetic risk of breast cancer increased interest in testing kits however , scientists have raised serious questions about the accuracy and value of such testing			1
dna testing also has a more sordid side as seen on controversial tv programmes like @entity89 ’s controversial @entity88 show , which uses dna paternity tests as the main tool to settle family disputes			1

it is the brainchild of biology scholar and online marketing expert , @entity129 , who highlighted the fact that the government supports the idea of creating an anonymised @entity84 genetic database of the nation to understand what the @entity136 should be spending its money on			2
mr @entity129 said : ‘ our dna is a map of our family history and in particular a key to understanding our risk of predisposition to certain diseases			2
‘ i share the health secretary @entity146 ’s view that @entity9 should become the first country in the world to routinely sequence people ’s genomes to help the @entity136 plan for our futures			1
‘ this information is invaluable for helpings a new industry of genetic counsellors , which i believe is required , to recommend lifestyle changes and treatments to enable patients to stay healthy for longer			0
