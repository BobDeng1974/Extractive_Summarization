it 's a scene most parents will hope they never have to see - the sight of their child self - harming			2
but this nightmare scenario became a reality for @entity6 , 40 , who walked into the kitchen in her @entity9 home one day to find her seven - year - old daughter , @entity11 , clutching a knife			1
' i walked into the kitchen and found @entity11 with a knife against her wrists , it was horrific , ' the mother recalled on today 's @entity18			1
presenter @entity24 , a mother - of - one , said it sounded like something from a horror movie and asked @entity6 how she dealt with the situation			2
' i had to remain calm for her but i wanted to cry and scream , ' @entity6 said			2
' i had to calm her down and took her outside and we sat on her swing set and talked about she she felt			0
she kept saying she felt different , that something was wrong and she did n't fit in			1
' @entity6 and her husband @entity42 , 42 , had noticed that their daughter had become more withdrawn but they had no idea why - or how serious the situation had become			2
' it started when she as about six , she started to say she did n't like herself , and often had emotional outbursts			0
@entity11 said she used to feel different and like she did n't fit in but with the support of her family and medical intervention , she now ' likes being who i am ' ' she found social settings were bewildering as she often misread people 's expressions			1
this made her withdrawn and she started wanting to miss school			0
' @entity6 could n't understand why her daughter was feeling like such an outsider as she had attended the same , small private school since she was 18 - months - old so knew all her classmates well			1
' i could n't blame myself , i knew something was going on with @entity11 , ' @entity6 said			1
after the terrifying incident in the kitchen , @entity6 took her daughter to see a doctor who prescribed anti-depressants			1
she was also referred to a specialist who diagnosed her with @entity27 's syndrome , an autistic spectrum disorder			1
the condition affects social interaction , communication , interests and behaviour and can lead to sufferers feeling anxious and depressed			0
@entity11 told parents watching if their children are self - harming : ' one day they will come round and it will be better but it will take a while ' ( file photo ) thanks to the medication she was given , the support of her family and being transferred to a specialist school where they have expert counsellors , @entity11 , now 11 , said she 's now feeling much better			1
she joined her mother on the @entity18 sofa to tell @entity24 and @entity23 : ' i 'm at a much better school now , i 'm enjoying school and have lots of friends			1
the teachers are supportive and i get a lot of attention			0
' for any parents of children who have been self - harming , @entity11 had the following advice : ' one day they will come round and it will be much better but it will take a while			2
' her mother added that it helps if the child can find something they ' love and are passionate about			0
' for @entity11 , it was discovering a love of beauty pageants which she now enjoys competing in and supporting charities by taking part in fundraising events			2
@entity11 , who appeared on the @entity119 show in a colourful , pretty party dress , said she 's now realised : ' i like being who i am			1
' she was invited to share her story on the show after it has been revealed that the number of children ending up in @entity128 after suffering a mental health crisis has almost doubled since 2010			0
this week is @entity130 , which aims to raise awareness of these troubled children and how they can be helped			0
earlier this week , the @entity133 recorded a video message showing her support			0
@entity133 , 33 , said that she and her husband the @entity137 have seen how many children struggle to cope with bullying , bereavement , family breakdown and other issues , which can lead to depression , anxiety , addiction and self - harm			0
the pregnant mother - of - one said the stigma around mental health means that many children do not get the help they so badly need , and this needs to change			0
she said : ' both @entity153 and i sincerely believe that early action can prevent problems in childhood from turning into larger ones later in life			0
