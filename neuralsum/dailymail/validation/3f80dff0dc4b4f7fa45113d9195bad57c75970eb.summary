@entity0 has revealed how he scrapped the exit strategy drawn up for @entity2 after a rapid mid-season transformation by the @entity5 midfielder			1
in less than three months , @entity2 has gone from an @entity7 outcast on loan at @entity9 to a player of such vital importance that he has been equipped with a protective mask which will enable him to play despite a broken nose against @entity14 on wednesday			1
' it has been a surprise to everybody , ' said @entity0			1
' i told him at the start of the season to give absolutely everything until @entity21 and then we would sit down together and see where we were			2
@entity2 stretches prior to @entity7 's training session ahead of their match against @entity14 @entity2 almost went on loan to @entity14 at the beginning of the season but the deal collapsed late on ' in myself , i thought if he does n't play at all until @entity21 , there was only six months contract to go and i would let him go somewhere else			1
you let the boy go			2
you do n't leave him completely out of the squad for six more months			2
' @entity2 almost joined @entity14 in august but a proposed one - year loan collapsed on deadline day and two months later he was loaned to @entity9 in the championship , only to be recalled early because @entity38 and @entity39 were struggling with injuries and poor form			1
' he was n't happy when i called him back , ' said @entity0			1
' he thought i had just called him back as cover			2
' @entity2 made his first @entity7 start for nearly two years at @entity43 on december 28 and has been ever - present in the @entity44 since			1
last month , the 23 - year - old signed a new contract tying him to @entity7 until 2018			1
@entity2 has gone from being a reserve to a player that may be encouraged to play even though he 's injured @entity0 admitted he had expected to release @entity2 at the end of the season @entity0 is criticised for his loyalty and patience with developing players , but this is a triumph for that policy and a reminder that some players take longer than others to mature			1
' he has analysed well what he is good at , ' said @entity0			1
he was in between the playmaking position and the box - to - box player and he is not that			2
he is a sitting player who can win the ball			2
' he has restricted his game to that and you make success in life with what you 're good at			0
you do n't have all the qualities but you have to express what you 're good at and he 's good at that			0
i think he can do that job			0
he is doing it now			0
' he is respectful , focused and open			0
he has a strong personality , he speaks his mind but does n't complain			0
let 's not forget , he has been world champion with the @entity81			0
but you have to climb from a youth prospect to a regular player in a top team and that 's not easy			2
he 's doing it now			0
' @entity2 broke his nose against @entity89 on sunday but trained on tuesday and has the mask ready if required at @entity91			1
@entity2 's stint in the first team has earned him a new long - term contract with the @entity95 the @entity5 midfielder has propelled himself above compatriot @entity39 in the pecking order ' he knows it 's an opportunity for him , ' said @entity0			1
' sometimes when you wait for such a long time to get your chance and you get it , the more you have suffered , the more you enjoy it			0
the human being is a strange animal			0
' he has gone through a lot of doubt , questioning himself , at many times being discouraged that he does n't get a chance			0
now that he has a chance he does n't want to let it slip away			0
he is a winner and he wants to win			0
that 's why he is so committed			0
' @entity38 , despite nagging injury problems , will extend his contract for one more year and @entity39 has another year on his deal , while @entity7 remain linked with @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120			1
' you can not want to play at a big club and have no competition , ' said @entity0			1
competition is part of our job			0
