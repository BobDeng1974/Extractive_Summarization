@entity0 , pictured , has vowed to bring the @entity2 party ' back from the dead ' embattled @entity4 faced a dramatic leadership challenge last night after a top @entity2 mp vowed to bring the party ‘ back from the dead ’			1
former @entity2 president @entity0 savaged deputy prime minister @entity4 ’s u-turn on university tuition fees and said the party had been ‘ tarnished ’ by the @entity11 with @entity12			1
@entity0 , a bitter @entity2 foe of @entity4 , said the party needed a tough new leader like ex-marine @entity16 who rescued it from a similar crisis in the 1980s			1
he said he had the ‘ vision and never say die ’ spirit needed to repair the slump in @entity2 fortunes under @entity4			1
left - winger @entity0 , hot favourite to succeed @entity4 if , as expected , the @entity2 flop in the election , threw down the gauntlet in an interview with @entity29			1
@entity4 ’s panicking allies have launched a ‘ stop @entity0 ’ campaign in a last - ditch attempt to stop him taking over after the election			1
but speaking ahead of the party ’s spring conference in @entity35 this weekend , @entity0 made it clear he is determined to replace @entity4			1
he brushed aside claims by the @entity4 camp that he is a ‘ sanctimonious , @entity39 - bothering , treacherous little s * * * ’ , compared @entity4 ’s leadership to the @entity2 ’ ‘ near death ’ in the 1980s and said voters would never forgive him for his tuition fees somersault			1
for a committed @entity45 , it is surprising how much hatred @entity0 generates among fellow top @entity2			1
there is no love lost between @entity0 and his main leadership rival , minister and @entity4 ally @entity50			1
@entity4 , @entity51 and co swallowed their @entity2 pride and principles , at least on occasion , for ministerial jobs and limos in the @entity58 , @entity0 , refused a government post by @entity4 , could grandstand from the sidelines , voting against the bedroom tax and tuition fees			1
@entity0 ’s supporters in the @entity2 sandal - wearing brigade say he is ‘ untainted ’ and see ‘ @entity68 ’ as a saviour			1
he became a @entity45 at 18 , when marooned in a house in rainy @entity70 on a trip with his mum			2
‘ there was nothing to blinkin ’ read and i read this weird - looking book on @entity39			2
it was life - changing , ’ he explains			0
@entity0 ’s conversation is peppered with ‘ blinkins ’ and ‘ bloomins ’ , adding to a boyish , @entity83 cartoon air of wide - eyed enthusiasm			1
the book he stumbled on said the @entity86 was true			0
and from that moment , @entity87 believed every word			0
he thinks @entity39 knows everything			0
‘ every hair on your head is numbered , ’ he says , without blinking			0
@entity39 knows every hair on his head ? ‘ yeah			0
’ @entity0 believes that @entity4 , pictured , blew the trust of the voters by his u-turn on tuition fees mr @entity0 , pictured , said neither of the two main parties should assume the @entity2 will prop them up he scoffs at the idea of a ‘ half - baked distant @entity39 – either he created every bloomin ’ atom in the entire universe or he did n’t ’			1
he derides those who believe in ‘ some kind of part - time , low - wattage @entity39 ’			0
similarly , he believes @entity107 really exist			0
@entity108 is ‘ a place where there ’s no more tears , no more crying , no more pain , no more suffering , no more death ’			0
it exists as a physical entity ? ‘ yeah			0
it ’s what the @entity86 tells me			0
’ his @entity45 beliefs made him agonise before dropping his opposition to gay marriage			0
@entity2 cynics are less generous : they say voting against it would have been fatal to his leadership hopes in a party known for its strong pro-gay rights stance			1
state - educated northerner @entity0 , 44 , has none of the expensive suits and modulated vowels of private schoolboy @entity4			1
it is hard to see him laughing and joking in the @entity131 @entity130 with @entity12			0
it ’s hard to see him in @entity133 at all			0
@entity0 dismisses @entity4 ’s claim that he had to back tuition fees to save the @entity11			1
you must not only keep your word but be seen to keep your word			0
you can say no , ’ he says emphatically			0
it was ‘ obvious ’ the @entity2 would be ‘ tarnished ’ by it and voters would not forgive them			1
‘ in 2010 , many people said : i am not voting for you because of the @entity144 ( in the 1970s ) when i was seven years old			0
just think what going into coalition with the @entity147 will do to our brand over the next generation			2
’ @entity4 allies are quick to point out @entity0 voted for the @entity11 deal			1
he insists he has been ‘ loyal ’ to his ‘ friend @entity153 ’			0
far from knifing @entity4 , he says he ‘ rode to the rescue ’ in several key party conference votes			1
‘ it sounds really up myself but … the day was saved			0
’ @entity0 , pictured , said he regrets signing a letter with fellow @entity2 mps to force former leader @entity159 's resignation claiming he was acting on the advice of an un-named senior party politician but in a clear dig at @entity4 , @entity0 makes it clear if there is another hung @entity168 after the election , and he is in charge , it will take more than a swanky limo to make him jump into bed with the @entity147 or @entity173			1
‘ if you believe what really matters is that ministerial car , you will give way to the other side more than you should			0
we are curating the party of @entity181 , ’ he declares grandly			2
‘ we must not crash it by making short - term decisions in any coalition agreement			2
’ if the party makes too many concessions in the crucial few days after the election , ‘ whoever ’s leader , whether it ’s @entity153 or somebody else … we ’re dead ’			2
@entity0 portrays himself as a heroic , visionary @entity16 - style @entity2 leader - in - waiting , name - checking him a dozen times during the interview			1
when @entity16 led the party it was the third force in politics			2
now it trails behind @entity197 and the @entity198 with up to half its 57 mps in danger of losing their seats in may			0
@entity0 says he will rebuild the @entity2 with the same ‘ absolute bloody - minded refusal to lie down and die ’ spirit displayed by @entity16 , a square - jawed @entity204 trained to kill with his bare hands			1
it is hard to see slight ‘ @entity208 ’ in the same vein			0
‘ i ’ve been paint - balling a couple of times , ’ he quips with a gap - toothed grin			0
he is not the only @entity0 preparing for the limelight : ‘ @entity215 ’ marvellous ’ wife @entity214 is ready to help him			2
the couple have four children and live in @entity218 in the @entity219 , where @entity0 is a local mp			2
‘ @entity214 might have to do some telly at some point			0
she gave a @entity222 talk last week – her first - ever public speech			0
’ @entity0 confesses he is ashamed of signing a letter with fellow @entity226 in 2006 which forced @entity159 to resign as leader			2
he claims he was ‘ persuaded ’ to do it by unnamed ‘ older mps ’			0
@entity0 was too discreet to mention it , but it is a matter of record that @entity4 , four years his senior , was among the signatories			1
for all his claims of loyalty , those who know @entity0 say he will have no regrets if @entity4 resigns			1
and @entity0 ’s sandal - wearing fans will be happy			2
does @entity0 own any sandals ? ‘ only for pratting around on holiday – and never in the @entity241 , ’ he laughs .			2

@entity0 said @entity4 should not have u-turned on tuition fees
he said the @entity2 will be hit by that decision at the next election
mr @entity0 said the party will not simply prop up another coalition after may
