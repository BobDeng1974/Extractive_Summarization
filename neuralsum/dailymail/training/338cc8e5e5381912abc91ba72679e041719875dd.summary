it 's that time of year again when i realise that @entity2 has crept up on me before i 'm ready			2
of course i know it 's coming - but those final few weeks of november go by so fast , do n't they ? one minute it was october and i was cursing the shops for daring to mention the c word			1
the next , it was the first week of december and i had not a gift to my name , and not a free weekend to shop before the @entity11			1
which is how i found myself hurtling round @entity14 's @entity13 at breakneck speed , doing my entire @entity2 shop in two hours			1
quick gifts : the @entity19 shopper , left , and the @entity21 coin purse , right , were no brainers for the girls in the family			1
@entity19 foldaway lips tote : @entity27 price : £ 29.17 , high street price : £ 23.25 ; @entity29 large cosmetic pouch : @entity27 price : £ 45.83 , high street price : £ 55 easy buy : i snapped up these children 's @entity34 at @entity36 for £ 23 ( same price as high street as children 's items are not taxed ) it was last friday ahead of a weekend away to @entity42 when i realised i had left myself with precisely no @entity2 shopping days			1
a combination of family gatherings , children 's parties and work conspired to ensure this year it would be impossible to hit the shops for a clear day			1
so when i arrived , child - and baggage - free , two hours early for my flight to @entity52 and was faced with a load of glossy new shops at @entity14 ( they 've just spent £ 21m doing up the @entity13 departure lounge ) , i had the bright idea of squeezing it all into the time i had before i flew			1
if i could nail the 20 - something - and - counting presents i needed to buy for my family before i boarded , @entity2 would be saved ... this optimistic notion was fuelled not only by the shiny new shops , but also the 20 % discount on @entity65 prices generally offered ( who does n't love a bargain ? ) and the fact that they offer a @entity71 , collect service , so i did n't have to lug around a single bag			1
i hate lugging bags , so this was very much good news			2
also , it would all be waiting for me in arrivals when i returned from my holiday			2
with my game face well and truly on , i scanned the @entity13 and spied an @entity21 ( the first to be located in an airport ) , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity36 , @entity83 and @entity84 , along with @entity86 jewellers ( another airport first ) and various smaller shops selling quirky bits and pieces			1
fun and functional : children 's @entity94 headphones from @entity83 for my three - year - old son ; touchscreen running gloves from @entity36 for the brother - in - law			0
@entity100 running gloves : @entity27 price : £ 18.33 , high street price : £ 23.00 @entity21 - think super luxe leather goods at a genuinely surprisingly affordable price - proved most fruitful , bearing a @entity105 flag purse , orange leather passport holder , croc diary , gorgeous leather keyring and snakeskin cuff that will keep the females in the family happy			1
it was also the most lethal : i self - gifted myself more than once and could have kept on going			0
@entity36 let me nail three children and a brother - in - law at once , with mini @entity34 trainers at £ 23 , a mini @entity116 kit for £ 33 , @entity117 running gloves with @entity120 touchscreen capability for £ 18 and a @entity100 football for £ 7			1
in @entity83 i found child - safe headphones by @entity94 , £ 13 , for my three - year - old son , plus one of the brilliant @entity126 yo - yo speakers for a friend , priced under £ 25 , which is the same price you could get it for online ( but with no delivery cost )			1
i take them everywhere and recommend them to everyone i know ; the sound for the size is epic			0
@entity138 got lucky with a long - sleeved @entity139 , while mother and auntie were sorted with @entity143 perfume for £ 53 instead of £ 66 and a @entity145 bangle for £ 34			1
what i liked best about the shopping , apart from the obvious money - saving aspect , was the number of unusual or unexpected ( and actually also useful ) gifts i could buy that i actually had n't seen on the @entity65 - and the selection that meant i could get people things they would really want , rather than the host of emergency books and booze you 'd expect from last minute airport shopping			0
case luggage travel accessories shop yielded some really cute @entity19 folding shopping bags , with a black nylon tote that folded up into a pair of shiny red or pink lips - and they only cost £ 29 ( @entity165 £ 36 )			1
a handy @entity168 speaker makes the perfect present for frequent travellers - the sound is truly epic for the size of the speaker			0
i recommend these to everyone			0
right , a @entity175 travel adapter made a perfect bargain stocking filler luxe for less : i solved a few tricky customers with @entity179 candles for £ 31.20 instead of £ 39 i found a very handy little gizmo that plugs into the car lighter to provide an adapter for two usb cables , so both front - seat passengers of the car can charge their phones at once ( genius )			2
the booze selection was excellent too			0
my cousin is a collector of unusual vodka bottles and has pretty much seen ' em all			0
but i found at least six to eight vodkas i suspect he wo n't have seen - from artisan @entity195 brand @entity194 to premium versions of big brands like @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200			0
i managed to narrow it down to a very enticing - looking bottle of @entity203 that i know he will love			0
i picked up a bottle of the @entity207 amaretto for a friend too ( i could n't resist the heart - motif wrap - it 's going to be hard to part with that one ) , and a bottle of @entity211 for a pal who has been known to smuggle her own bottle into more than one pub in her time			0
a tricky uncle and discerning colleague were ticked off with @entity179 candles for £ 31.20 instead of £ 39			2
i know many people deem the scented candle a lazy , cliched gift ... but i absolutely disagree			0
if it 's the right one , it 's a joy to receive - and with the beautiful @entity179 wrapping , it 's a joy to give as well			0
@entity2 spirit : @entity207 made a lovely gift for a girlfriend , while @entity229 goes to one of my wilder pals by now the flight was showing boarding and my previous gentle stroll around the shops turned into a frantic dash as i vowed to finish the job i 'd started			2
a last minute whizz round @entity84 ( actually a very , very nice 6,500sq ft version of the store , with clothes , food and trinkets ) yielded the rest of my gifts			1
chocolate coffee beans topped up @entity247 , ground coffee in an attractive printed tin did @entity138 , biscuits for @entity251 , cocoa - covered almonds for another auntie			0
it felt utterly surreal having just dropped a few hundred quid in a series of shops yet finding myself walking empty handed to my gate to board my flight - but let me tell you , it felt frickin ' brilliant to have got the @entity2 shop out the way - and in such a fuss - free fashion			1
knowing that passengers have an average of 30 minutes to browse the shops , the stores are staffed to the hilt			2
all tills are open at all times and assistants are dotted around to make sure no one is left unattended			0
it makes for a very slick and pain - free experience - which is the opposite of the feeling you get when battling the crowds on @entity277 or in a busy shopping centre			0
and the best bit ? you get to go on holiday as well			0
now if only they would wrap it for me too ... @entity284 : @entity27 price : £ 45.83 , high - street price : £ @entity287 : @entity288 : £ 14.95 - @entity289 : @entity288 : £ 5.95 - @entity289 : @entity288 : £ 10.95 - @entity2 decoration : @entity288 : £ @entity291 : @entity27 price : £ 53.55 , high - street price : £ 66.95 - @entity179 candles : @entity27 price : £ 31.20 each , high - street price : £ 39jd sports - converse red : @entity27 price : £ 23 , high street price : same price as children 's item ( no tax ) - @entity100 running gloves : @entity27 price : £ 18.33 , high street price : £ 23.00 - small ball : @entity27 price : £ 7.49 , high street price : £ 9.00 - @entity116 outfit : @entity27 price : £ 33 , high street price : same price as children @entity311 car charger : @entity27 price : £ 6.99 , high street price : same price - @entity316 @entity315 foldaway lips tote : @entity27 price : £ 29.17 , high street price : £ @entity319 - @entity318 speaker : @entity27 price : £ 24.99 , internet price : same price - @entity324 earplugs : @entity27 price : £ 24.96 , internet price : £ 25 - @entity94 headphones kids headphones with volume limiter : @entity27 price : £ 13.42 , internet price : £ 13.49			2
