sir @entity0 has revealed that @entity1 kept thanking him for selling @entity2 to @entity3 during the @entity4			1
the former @entity6 manager gave a 30 - minute talk to @entity9 ’s team at @entity10 before answering questions from @entity1 , @entity12 @entity0 is keeping what he said a secret but insists @entity3 fan @entity1 was delighted with @entity6 ’s decisions to sell @entity2 to the @entity17 giants for £ 80million in 2009			1
sir @entity0 gave a motivational talk to the @entity9 team ahead of the @entity4 earlier this year @entity0 , speaking to world no 1 @entity21 at this year 's @entity4 in @entity22 @entity1 , in action at the @entity24 , thanked @entity0 for selling @entity2 @entity0 's full interview appears in the @entity26 speaking to the @entity26 , @entity0 said : ‘ when @entity28 first approached me about going up to @entity10 , we agreed that what was said in the dressing room stayed in the dressing room			1
that ’s the way i ’ve always operated			2
' but it ’s ok for me to tell you that i talked mainly about how to cope with being a favourite , just like we usually were at @entity6			2
i also spoke with the caddies and with the players ’ wives about different things			2
‘ but the banter was great			2
i mean , @entity21 and @entity42 are season - ticket holders at @entity44 but @entity45 supports @entity46 , @entity47 supports @entity48 , @entity49 supports @entity50 and @entity1 is a huge @entity3 fan			1
he kept thanking me for transferring @entity2 ! ‘ but really my main contribution was to encourage everyone to be calm over the seven days			2
when @entity6 were involved in big games , i always tried to help the team think it was just another day until we got right down to business			2
outside of football , the @entity4 at @entity10 was the greatest sporting challenge in which i ’ve been involved			1
’ @entity2 has starred at @entity3 since he signed for the @entity17 giants five years ago since retiring from football at the end of the 2012 - 2013 campaign , @entity0 has also been lecturing at @entity63 and revealed his concerns over whether @entity65 would make it as a footballer due to his small stature			1
he said : ‘ we talked a bit about how you pick the stars of the future and nurture them , something i ’ve done all my life in football			0
i was very aware that the first time i clapped eyes on @entity65 , i thought , ‘ too small ’			0
' but that ’s when nurturing talent comes in			0
and you ’re rewarded hugely			0
it ’s a fantastic challenge but i ’m speaking mostly about leadership and i ’m comfortable doing that			0
’ @entity0 is still involved in football as chairman of the @entity86 and as a member of the @entity88 and @entity90 technical study group – meaning he remains instrumental in the future direction of the game			1
he added : ‘ right now we ’re looking at the possibility of introducing sin - bins like they have in rugby ; a ten - minute suspension during the match			1
but we want to be careful that somehow it is n’t exploited if it ’s introduced			0
' we ’re also looking at wiping out bookings when teams reach the latter stages of a cup competition			0
we lost @entity105 from the @entity106 against @entity107 and also missed @entity108 and @entity65 for picking up cards in the 1999 @entity110 against @entity111			0
' now , they ’d all played in all the previous rounds so it was n’t fair that they missed out			0
we ’ll see on that one			0
we ’re also looking at allowing eleven substitutes on the bench for big finals in @entity9			1
that way you can recognise the contribution the squad ’s made and allow a wider range of substitutions			0
' the full interview with sir @entity0 appears in the current @entity26 , out now .			1
