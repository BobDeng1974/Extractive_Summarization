@entity0 has likened the situation between @entity2 and @entity3 at @entity4 to the rift he had with @entity6 at @entity7 more than 15 years ago			1
former @entity7 striker @entity0 was dropped by @entity6 in 1999 for their @entity9 derby against @entity11 at @entity12 , which turned out to be the @entity15 manager 's final match as he resigned three days after the 2 - 1 defeat			1
@entity2 was left on the substitutes ' bench for 75 minutes of saturday 's scrappy 1 - 0 win over @entity20 at @entity21 amid reports of a rift developing between the club captain and manager @entity3			2
' something has gone wrong between the manager who nearly guided the club to a first @entity38 title and one of the club 's greatest - ever players , ' @entity0 wrote in his column @entity43 ' have no doubt about it - @entity2 was unceremoniously dropped at @entity21 on saturday			2
forget about his age or being rested , or not being able to play every game ... he was axed , plain and simple			0
@entity3 revealed @entity2 , pictured gesturing to the crowd at @entity21 , has been offered a new deal @entity2 came on in the 75th minute as the crowd applaud during the 1 - 0 @entity38 win over @entity20 ' i remember being in a situation at @entity7 when @entity6 dropped me for our biggest game of the season at home to @entity11			1
he did not even have the courtesy to tell me , i just read it on the board in the dressing room			0
' he was obviously flexing his muscles as manager and maybe @entity3 is doing the same			0
' mind you , it did prove to be the last game @entity6 had as @entity7 manager			0
' that is certainly not the case with @entity3 at @entity4 and nor should it be			0
but surely if @entity4 have a big game , the first name on the team - sheet has still got to be @entity2 - not ( @entity73 ) @entity72 , ( @entity74 ) @entity75 or ( @entity77 ) @entity76 , but @entity2			2
' @entity0 ( left , in the white ) looks on from the bench behind then - @entity7 manager @entity6 in 1999 @entity0 and @entity6 shook hands during the @entity82 's @entity81 coverage in @entity83 after the disagreements @entity6 dropped @entity85 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) for the biggest game of the season in 1999			1

@entity0 says @entity6 was ' flexing his muscles ' by dropping him for @entity7 's @entity9 derby defeat against @entity11 in 1999
the former @entity7 striker *suspects* @entity3 is doing the same
@entity0 feels @entity2 should be ' the first name on the team - sheet '
@entity2 , 34 , was dropped to the substitutes ' bench against @entity20
