by @entity0 published : 06:19 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 07:21 est , 4 june 2013 a 23 - year - old woman who binged on party drugs including ketamine and ' meow meow ' during her teenage years - at one point snorting as many as 100 lines a day - has spoken out about how the substances left her body in tatters , and revealed she will now be having her bladder removed as a result of the damage inflicted upon it			1
@entity13 , now clean , says she ' loved ' taking horse tranquiliser ketamine and mephedrone , commonly known as ' meow meow ' , at parties , and quickly fell into a pattern of taking 5g - 50 lines - of each drug every day			1
both substances cost £ 10 per gram			0
speaking to closer magazine in the wake of a report revealing deaths by party drugs have quadrupled over the last five years , the young administrator from @entity25 - whose mother is a horse trainer and father a bus driver - said she ' fell in with the wrong crowd ' after leaving home to live in a hostel aged 16			1
@entity13 was taking 100 lines of ketamine and miow miow during her lowest point , and as a result she is now having her ruined bladder removed entirely @entity13 says she was a rebellious teenager but did n't realise the drugs were as dangerous as @entity44 substances such as cocaine and heroin - which she says she would never take - because mephedrone was still legal , and ketamine had been banned only the previous year			1
when a friend offered her the party drugs she was told they were harmless			2
but soon her habit spiraled out of control , and eventually @entity13 began finding blood in her urine			1
@entity13 and friends at one of the parties where they regularly did hundreds of pounds of party drugs despite taking the drugs during the day , @entity13 still managed to complete her @entity64 college course and work full - time at a call centre			1
but after collapsing at a party she was admitted to hospital where doctors revealed her bladder was so badly damaged - infected and covered with ulcers and scars - that she was going to have to have a catheter fitted			2
she was forced to carry it around in her handbag , being able to drink only half a can of @entity77 before having to empty her bladder			2
deaths by party drugs such as ketamine and mephedrone have quadrupled in the last five years she said : ' other girls have to pack their lipstick - but i have to carry a catheter in my handbag			1
i 'm a totally different person now - my confidence has gone			0
read more in this month 's closer , out now ' i feel so unattractive			2
i have n't been intimate with anyone , let alone admitted the truth to a man			0
' recently , tests revealed that the damage has worsened			0
and later this month @entity13 will be having her bladder completely removed and a new one fashioned out of part of her bowel			1
she will ' urinate ' through a hole next to her belly button			1
she is horrified at the damage she has done to herself , and can not believe that the drugs she was taking recreationally were ever legal to begin with			0
she said : ' i 'm so ashamed , but i want people to know about my condition because they need to realise how dangerous these drugs are			1
' i did n't take the risks seriously because meow meow was legal back then and ketamine had only recently been made illegal			0
' i do n't know if i will find a boyfriend or have a family - i ca n't bring myself to get intimate with a man			0
i feel ashamed and dirty			0
' @entity110 , spokesperson for drugs charity @entity111 , said : ' young people do n't realise how dangerous party drugs can be - the health risks must not be underestimated			1
' for help surrounding substance abuse issues visit @entity117 or @entity118 read more in @entity119 , out now , or online at @entity120 it ’s a powerful general anaesthetic that ’s used for operations on humans and animals			0
the effects do n’t last long , but until they wear off , ketamine can cause a loss of feelings in the body and paralysis of the muscles			0
it can also lead to users experiencing a distortion of @entity135 , a @entity44 drug , can : @entity136 ( often called ‘ meow meow ’ ) is a powerful stimulant and is part of the cathinone family , a group of drugs that are closely related to the amphetamines - including amphetamine itself ( often called ‘ speed ’ ) , methamphetamine and ecstasy			2
there is very little evidence about mephedrone and what long - term effects it has , but there have reports of people hospitalised due to the short - term effects			0
also , you can never be entirely sure that what you ’re buying is actually mephedrone and not something else.the main effects and risks of mephedrone , a @entity44 drug , include : extracted from @entity118			0
