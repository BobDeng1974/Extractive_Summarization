not many people were more excited for the first day of spring - weather in sync or not - than @entity3			2
the 29 - year - old events planner moved to @entity5 from @entity6 two years ago and does n't have any family in town			2
when the first of many record - breaking snowfalls dumped down on the city in january , @entity3 was sick with the flu , and did n't dig out her 2007 @entity13			1
only the snow did n't stop , and the street plows only pushed more mounds in and around where her car was parked in @entity19			2
by the time @entity3 got her shovel out , it was all - but too late			1
' i 'm 5 ' 2 , ' and it was all ice , an iceberg on top of my car , ' @entity3 told the @entity25			2
' i could n't reach it			0
i could n't lift it			0
and even if i could , there was nowhere to put it			0
i just did n't know what to do			0
' after a few laughs , quite a lot of tears , and at lease one breakdown , @entity3 realized she had no choice but to abandon her car until winter passed			1
it 's under the iceberg : @entity3 was sick with the flu during the first big snow of winter in @entity5 in winter , and after failing to dig out her car , it ended up under this mountain of snow on @entity45 in the @entity19 neighborhood there it is : recently , some of the ' iceberg ' began to clear and the car - or at least its shape - became a little more clear not again : but with this winter being @entity5 's snowiest ever , the heavens kept opening and the car kept getting buried bleak : @entity3 's car is seen parked on @entity45 in @entity5 on february 23 , 2015			1
winter 2015 yielded the largest record snowfall in the city of @entity5 's history clearing up : @entity3 's car went through weeks of storms and melting snow , staying frozen in place at the same on - street parking spot almost there : by last week - march 12 - and after two months almost , the @entity13 was almost ready to escape its cave finally ! : on march 16 , @entity3 's was finally back on the road , seven weeks after it was first snowed in yay ! all - smiles , @entity3 finally got behind the wheel of her car on march 18 , and was shocked that it started right away but after seven weeks , and a heap of chipping , the car has finally freed from its icy cave			1
sadly not much could be done about the damage			0
the windscreen buckled under the weight of the snow and is all smashed up			0
there were also deep dents in the roof			0
but , surprisingly , the car started on the first go after it had thawed			0
@entity3 said her insurance company will now assess the damage			2
while she hopes that future winters wo n't be so severe , and will plow her car diligently from now on , she learnt a valuable lesson			0
' if i had to do it again , i would definitely do one thing differently , ' she told @entity93			0
' i would not park on the corner			0
' although the storm did n't cripple @entity5 as previous storms have , it still created a nuisance for snow - weary residents damage : the weight of the snow and ice smashed the windscreen and dented the roof quite badly , but @entity3 is filing an insurance claim many people in the northeastern @entity107 had to put on winter boots as @entity109 hijacked the first official day of spring the @entity110 was coated with snow as @entity112 was hit with yet another snowstorm on friday , march 20 @entity110 residents had to bundle up and deal with the cold even though friday was the first day of spring @entity116 arrived on friday , but @entity109 ensured that winter would have at least one more go around with snow @entity119 will continue to fall in some parts of the country throughout the weekend @entity109 may have cause more issues for @entity3 and her car on friday			1
although the storm did n't cripple the city as previous storms have , it still created a nuisance for snow - weary @entity5			1
in the city , it 's par for the course to pick up another 3 to 4 inches of snow after march 20 , @entity128 reported			1
during the @entity133 of 1997 , 25.4 inches of snow in just 24 hours paralyzed @entity5			2
on friday , @entity134 led to some travel advisories and early school dismissals @entity128 meteorologist @entity137 said : ' while late march surface temperatures and @entity109 's quick movement wo n't make this a blockbuster , some fairly impressive snowfall rates today will likely lead to at least a slushy afternoon commute in parts of the @entity112 and @entity145 metros			1
the storm dumped 7.3 inches of snow in @entity148 , @entity149 , 6.7 inches at @entity150 in @entity151 and six inches in @entity152 , @entity153 .			1

winter 2015 yielded the largest record snowfall in the city of @entity5 's history
