her family believe monday night ’s tragedy came from reading and writing on websites where girls idealise slim celebrities such as @entity20 , while describing how they cut themselves and contemplate taking their own lives			1
in a blog , @entity3 , a talented ballet dancer , spoke of her struggles with bulimia , her compulsion to slash herself with a razor blade and plans to kill herself			1
callous strangers responded by telling the clearly underweight girl she was fat and urging her to commit suicide			2

i do n’t even know what to do			0
i ’m sitting here crying my eyes out , praying that the people around me will be okay			0
‘ praying that i wo n’t pick up a blade			0
i just do n’t understand how someone could say that , say that to someone who has been planning their suicide for almost 3 weeks			2
’ on monday night – a couple of hours after writing on her blog ‘ i ’m so f * * * * * * sorry ’ – the teenager appears to have carried out her plan to end her life			2
she was pronounced dead on the rail line close to her home in @entity50 , south - east @entity5 , after being hit by the @entity51 to @entity53 train			1
the tragedy , and @entity3 ’s family ’s planned campaign against the offending websites , will add to concern about online communities that encourage vulnerable youngsters to starve themselves and take their own lives			1

tributes : friends of @entity3 left flowers and notes at @entity86 in tribute to the schoolgirl you 'll never be forgotten : one of @entity3 's friends left a note expressing her sadness at the schoolgirl 's death ‘ however , during a period of stress brought on by the pressures of conforming to her peer group and studying hard for @entity101 exams , it appears she was , unfortunately , heavily influenced by websites and online communities promoting self - harm and suicide			1
‘ we hope her tragic death serves as a warning to other impressionable youngsters and their parents that such sites pose grave risks			1

according to her blog , @entity3 , who was an army cadet , had been plagued by thoughts of death , and false beliefs that she was fat and unattractive			1
it appears she had given up her habit of obsessively cutting herself with a razor blade , but an apparent relationship break - up seems to have tipped her over the edge			0
she also repeatedly referred to her weight and starvation attempts			0
@entity3 posted numerous photographs of excessively thin models – some distorted to make the women even more skeletal than in reality – and others of arms slashed by a razor blade			2
she spoke of having obvious wounds she had to hide from her mother			0
in the heading of her blog are the words ‘ and then she broke ’ , beneath which she declared : ‘ @entity3 , 15 , @entity5			2
