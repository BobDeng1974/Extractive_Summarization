by @entity0 it 's only natural to fear being upstaged on your wedding day , so imagine competing with 2,499 other brides			0
but that did not deter these couples - some of whom met just days ago - when they married today in the romantic surroundings of a 25,000 - seat sports stadium			1
dressed in gleaming white with the men in sharp black suits , they were part of only the second ' cosmic blessing ' by @entity17 's famous @entity16 since the death of its leader , divisive self - proclaimed messiah @entity19 , in september 2012			1
we do ! some 2,500 couples took part in a mass ' cosmic blessing ' today by @entity17 's @entity25 , founded by self - proclaimed messiah @entity19 with this ring i thee wed.			1
. and what 's your name again ? some of the couples met just days ago and not all spoke the same language , as part of the faith 's tradition blessing : @entity17 's @entity25 is famous for its cosmic blessing ceremonies , often held in sports stadiums			1
more than 40 of the couples met just days ago love ( with an earpiece ) : one newlywed couple make the heart shape with their hands			2
they will have to abstain from sex for at least 40 days and nights scale : the church was founded in 1954 by self - proclaimed messiah @entity19 and its first blessing had 33 couples			1
today 's ceremony was held by his widow need a private moment , dear ? while some of the couples were reaffirming their vows , others did not even speak the same language and were united by ' @entity62 ' after confirming under oath that they are virgins the couples sprinkle holy water , recite vows pledging themselves to be fathful to each other and exchange rings and prayers			2
but the tradition then steers wildly away from @entity73 marriage - as the newlyweds must then go for at least 40 days without having sex			1
the period of abstinence is supposed to be an echo of @entity79 's 40 days and nights wandering the desert , where the @entity82 says he remained in the wilderness as the devil appeared to him and offered him a string of temptations , all of which he ignored			1
a highly controversial figure accused of leading a cult , @entity19 founded his church in 1954 and began holding the mass ' blessings ' soon afterwards , which grew to global prominence as he gained followers around the world			1
the first ceremony in 1961 attracted just 33 couples , but they soon expanded			0
in one such mass blessing in 1997 , 30,000 couples tied the knot in @entity102 two years later 21,000 filled the @entity103 in @entity104			1
@entity19 died in september 2012 at the age of 92 of complications from pneumonia , and today 's ceremony - as with another with 3,500 couples this time last year - was overseen by his 71 - year - old widow @entity112			2
are you sitting comfortably ? seats were laid out in neat rows in the stadium , a vast sports and cultural complex on the outskirts of @entity17 capital @entity104 identical : standing from plastic chairs , the couples were dressed the same with women in white dresses and veils and the men in black suits with white shawls devotion : newlyweds bow to @entity19 's 71 - year - old widow @entity112 , described by followers who flock from around the world as ' @entity62 ' @entity134 ceremony : though taking place in a free and democratic country , the mass spectacle is reminiscent of displays by @entity17 's dictatorship neighbour to the north it was held at the @entity142 , a vast sports and cultural stadium with a full roof buried in the countryside on the outskirts of the @entity17 capital @entity104			1
as the second - largest arena of its kind in @entity153 , it is the same venue where the religious leader 's opulent funeral was held in 2012			2
confetti was hurled into the air today as the identically - dressed couples exchanged their vows , with women dressed in traditional white dresses and veils while the men wore sharp black suits with white shawls			0
some of the couples were already married and were reaffirming their vows , while others had been engaged for some time			0
for some , however , cold feet would be a real danger - as they would have met their partners just days before			0
some 140 people from 10 countries who were born into the church - 43 men and 97 women - gathered at a camp near the venue last week for a ' matching ceremony ' to meet their new partners for the first time			2
the newlyweds - to - be , five of whom were from @entity185 , went to classes and lectures alongside each other before putting on their wedding clothes after lunch and waiting for the ' @entity192 's widow - to appear and match them up with each other			0
@entity112 began matching the oldest candidates , working her way down to the youngest			0
the church 's @entity185 website said : ' after the matches were confirmed , it was a joy to watch the new couples converse happily with one another , many of them with the help of a translator			0
' confetti : the blessing was just one step in a long a complex process which ends in the formal unification between man and woman in a three - day ceremony sharing a prayer : but the insistence that leader @entity19 was the second coming of @entity79 led him to be regarded with wide suspicion as a cult figure stadium : the ceremonies have taken place regularly			1
the church claims to have three million members but most people say that number is far smaller it 's time to party ! there were so many couples that they and their guests filled the arena , which is the second - largest of its kind in @entity153 spectacle : a bride and groom to be take a minute to absorb the view in the stadium - or are they taking a cheeky pair of selfies ? here come the brides : a woman complete with a bridal veil and white glove takes a moment to take a photo			2
today 's ceremony was the second since @entity19 died devotion : the mass blessings have become a world - famous ritual , with couples who are already married reaffirming vows alongside those joining for the first time say cheese : although many people may find the ritual unusual , it was a happy affair for the thousands of couples who posed for photos together afterwards one of the @entity185 participants who got married today added : ' it 's weird to think that any one of these women who i am sitting next to during lectures , or eating lunch at the same table with , could be my future spouse			1
' @entity19 was famous for personally pairing up couples who could not even speak the same language because he preferred marriages to be across cultures and nations			2
his teachings included that more earthy romantic love ruined society by leading to sexual promiscuity and badly - matched couples			0
after the 40 - day period of separation , couples join together for the ' three day ceremony ' , the last step in the unusual process			2
according to the church 's @entity185 website : ' over a three - day period , the wife gives rebirth to her husband from the position of mother and then receives him in the position of wife			0
' then in the position of father , the husband gives rebirth to his wife and receives her in the position of husband			0
through this process , @entity298 breathes into the couple a new conjugal life			0
' despite gaining a huge following around the world , the insistence that @entity19 was the second coming of @entity79 led him to be regarded with wide suspicion as a cult leader			1
in 1982 , he was jailed for 13 months in the @entity185 for filing false federal income tax returns			0
his church insisted he had been pursued by the authorities because of his religious activities			0
the church claims to have three million members worldwide , though most sources say that number is likely to be far smaller			0
cult - like : the @entity19 , pictured left in 1998 with his wife who oversaw today 's ceremony , said he had a vision in which @entity298 told him to do the messiah 's work history : the ceremonies have happened for several decades , such as this one at the @entity322 in the south @entity17 capital @entity104 on october 14 , 1982 cult of personality : mourners gather beneath a gigantic depiction of @entity19 at the same stadium as today 's ceremony during a memorial service in august last year leader : wearing a crown , @entity19 wedded 4,200 ' @entity332 ' at @entity334 's @entity333 during a 1982 ceremony in which he picked couples himself			1

wedding by @entity25 was second since the death of leader and self - declared messiah @entity19
he founded the church in @entity17 in 1954 and it since became famous for its mass ' blessing ' ceremonies
participants have to refrain from sex for 40 days and nights after getting married to echo @entity79 in the desert
huge ceremony held at the @entity355 , a 25,000 - seat stadium in @entity357 - *gun* , @entity17
