will @entity0 win the @entity1 without @entity2 ? at times it was like watching a @entity4 - ‘ @entity6 arcade game instead of @entity0			1
they can be a team of bruisers when they need to be			0
@entity9 was on the carousel in @entity11 last night , kicked to death as @entity0 ’s players took it in turns to nobble him			1
@entity16 ’s @entity15 was the danger - man , the @entity1 ’s leading goalscorer after hitting the target five times on their journey to the quarter - finals			1
@entity0 did a number on him			2
after that , this bruising @entity1 quarter - final was a free - for - all			1
there were 54 fouls in all and that ’s plain daft at this level			2
in fact , that 's the most fouls committed than in any match at this tournament so far			2
the previous most was 51 from @entity0 vs @entity47			1
by the finish , when @entity16 substitute @entity64 just bundled over @entity65 by the touchline , @entity63 had completely lost control of the match			2
@entity16 got their revenge of sorts when @entity2 was stretcher off in the final minutes of this incredible quarter - final tie in @entity11			1
set aside the brilliance of his delivery for @entity77 ’s seventh minute strike and @entity79 ’s belting free - kick , this game belonged to another era			2
a regular sight : @entity9 lies on the ground clutching his knee while @entity16 's team approach the referee friends or foes : @entity0 's @entity79 comforts @entity9 after a bruising performance that ended in defeat our emotional attachment to the 1970 @entity0 team , when @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 ruled the world , will not be eclipsed by this team			1
instead they can be remembered for this wild night in the @entity100 for bullying their way past @entity16 and a referee who let them get away with it			2
to think that @entity63 is one of the best referees in @entity107 and yet he let @entity0 get away with ambush tactics on @entity9 , @entity110 and @entity111			1
all three were smashed to bits			0
short of grabbing @entity9 by his testicles , @entity0 ’s players went through the card when it came to finding ways to stop the @entity16 forward			1
at least he got a goal , his sixth of the tournament			0
@entity26 ’s challenge was ‘ a reducer ’ as @entity121 used to love calling the first , brutal tackle of any match			0
@entity40 , @entity79 , @entity37 and @entity0 ’s captain @entity77 all had a crack at him after that			2
the poor kid is n’t streetwise enough just yet to shake them off and he knew that every time he took a touch then someone in one of those yellow shirts was about to snap him in half			0
by the time he headed for the tunnel at the break , he had been fouled four times			0
@entity137 ( three ) and @entity111 ( three ) were not far behind			0
until @entity9 slipped the ball through for @entity139 to earn @entity16 a penalty , he was a passenger in this passionate arena			1
busy night : referee @entity142 is confronted by @entity16 's players after another decision one of the best : @entity63 is considered to be among @entity107 's elite referees but let @entity0 's ambush continue finally ! @entity77 is shown a yellow card by @entity50 , who let @entity0 rough @entity16 up throughout 6 - @entity9 ( @entity16 ) 4 - @entity150 ( @entity151 ) , @entity152 ( @entity153 ) , @entity2 ( @entity0 ) 3 - @entity154 ( @entity155 ) , @entity156 ( @entity157 ) , @entity158 ( @entity157 ) , @entity159 ( @entity160 ) , @entity161 ( @entity162 ) those in italic are out of the @entity1			1
he scored from the spot , his sixth goal of this incredible tournament , but it felt like it was too late to change the direction of the game			0
we are watching a 21st century @entity0 at this @entity1 , a team who can play a bit and kick a bit			1
it ’s not always easy to watch			0
when @entity2 is on the ball , teasing his way through opposition defences with those mesmerising runs , they are still a joy			0
then there is the nasty side , the predatory attacks when defenders jump out of darkened alleys and take out the main men			0
this is the way they have to play , particularly with so many of @entity192 ’s key personnel playing their football at the highest level in @entity107			0
@entity79 , @entity37 , @entity77 , @entity195 , @entity40 , @entity26 , @entity2 , @entity65 and @entity38 have all played @entity197 football			0
it feels barbaric at times and yet they have found a way to out - muscle their opponents			0
when the going gets rough , @entity0 get going			1
opposites : @entity0 can be easy on the eyes but their win over @entity16 was tough to watch rough : @entity79 chases the ball as @entity16 's @entity210 goes to ground after being fouled do n't mess with him : @entity79 ( pictured ) , @entity37 , @entity77 , @entity195 , @entity40 and @entity26 were rough two - footed challenge : @entity79 celebrates his spectacular free - kick by kicking the corner flag afterwards			1

@entity28 vs @entity16 sees most fouls of the tournament with 54
@entity9 given rough treatment and is fouled six times during loss
previous most fouls in 2014 @entity1 was @entity28 vs @entity47 with 51
@entity0 beat @entity16 2 - 1 to set up *semi-final* *showdown* with @entity151
