@entity0 has played down his insults of @entity2 and @entity3 as ' x-rated trash ' , insisting he believes ' she is an amazing talent '			1
in his new memoirs , the potential @entity7 presidential contender slams the married hip - hop duo for their explicit lyrics - and brand president @entity11 irresponsible for letting his daughters listen to their music			1
' how can it be that the @entity19 let @entity20 and @entity19 listen to that trash ? ' the onetime @entity17 governor - turned - @entity15 host asks			1
' ' @entity3 is a very shrewd businessman , ' @entity0 adds , ' but i wonder : does it occur to him that he is arguably crossing the line from husband to pimp by exploiting his wife as a sex object ? ' the exact revealed on january 9 sparked uproar			1
on sunday , the former baptist minister back - pedaled , insisting ' you have to read the whole chapter '			1
" ' my point is , she does n't have to do some of the things that she does in the lyrics because it 's not necessary			2
she has nothing to make up for			0
she 's an amazing talent			2
' in his book , @entity0 writes : ' @entity2 ... has an exceptional set of pipes and can actually sing			1
she is a terrific dancer – without the explicit moves best left for the privacy of her bedroom			0
' but that 's where the love-fest ends in the book @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70			1
the book hits shelves on january 20 and is seen as a vehicle for @entity0 to take a second bite at the presidential campaign apple in 2016			2
he last ran in 2008 , winning the @entity77 caucuses and five super tuesday primaries before conceding the @entity7 nomination to @entity81 sen. @entity80			0
@entity0 's weekend @entity15 show has positioned him as a conservative culture warrior who may find it difficult to attract an audience in an increasingly secular @entity86			1
and nowhere in his book is the culture war between the coasts and ' flyover country ' more present than in his backhand dismissals of @entity3 and @entity2			1
the music video for ' @entity93 , ' the song @entity0 criticizes in his book , includes explicit lyrics and images of a sultry @entity2 strutting on a beach ' from husband to @entity100 ' : @entity3 makes an appearance in the ' drunk in @entity104 ' video , rapping ' slip the panties right to the side / @entity106 n't got the time to take drawers off ' as his wife dances seductively the pair headlined the @entity111 , opening the broadcast with a performance of their hit ' drunk in @entity104			1
' @entity0 calls it a ' song ' – air quotes included			0
' @entity2 must have been confused , ' he writes , ' when she agreed to humiliate herself by performing in a way that prompted this comment from author @entity122 ( whose book when did ' @entity124 ? ' says it all ) : ' honestly , i did n't want to watch @entity3 and @entity2 's foreplay '			1
' ' the song contains words and imagery so graphic that they would never make it through the editing process of this book			2
( not that i would want them to ! ) ' but the onstage gyrations , bare flesh , and ( most of ) the lyrics did make it onto @entity139 , again during the smoldering remnants of what used to be the ' family hour '			0
' @entity0 's latest culture - war book hits shelves on january 20 @entity2 's rap lyrics in @entity93 include ' i get filthy when that liquor get into me			1
' her husband enters the song halfway through , intoning about ' foreplay in the foyer / f * * * ed up my @entity152			0
' ' slip the panties right to the side , ' @entity3 continues in the wildly popular track			2
' @entity106 n't got the time to take drawers off			0
' the song 's video has been played a stunning 245 million times on @entity161 , treating viewers to repeated shots of @entity2 gyrating in a swimsuit and swapping lines with @entity3 about their sex life			1
@entity2 , @entity0 reflects , ' was a huge , breakout star before going x-rated			2
she proved she does n't need to lower herself to this type of crude exploitation to be a megastar			0
' ' she must know that millions of young girls look up to her as a role model to emulate			0
and she even has a daughter herself now			0
so why has she done this ? ' first lady @entity175 is a close @entity2 friend , taking @entity20 , her younger daughter , to a concert in july			2
the singer serenaded the first couple as they danced at their first inaugural ball , and performed @entity86 's national anthem at president @entity11 's second inauguration			0
she later admitted she had lip - synched the patriotic song			0
but @entity2 has been to the @entity186 numerous times with @entity3 and remains close to the @entity19			1
she was the star attraction at the first lady 's 50th birthday party a year ago , and the a-listers hosted a fundraiser for the president in 2012			0
in a december 2013 @entity195 interview , the president said that both of his daughters have ' gotten to know @entity2 , and she has always been very sweet to them			1
' ' that trash ' : @entity2 performed onstage at the 2014 @entity199 at @entity200 in @entity201 , @entity202 former @entity17 gov. @entity0 was a force to be reckoned with in 2008 , winning the @entity204 and five super tuesday primaries before conceding the @entity7 presidential nomination to sen. @entity80 he told @entity208 in a softball 2012 interview that he and the first lady ' do n't constrain ' the music elder daughter @entity19 listens to			1
' we expect her to show some good judgment			0
' ' we actually share tastes in hip - hop and rap music , ' the president added , ' but we do n't listen to it together , because some of the language in there would embarrass me – at least while i 'm listening to it with her			1
' ' folks like @entity3 , @entity227 , we both like them , but when it comes on and i 'm sitting with her and @entity20 , then i fast - forward because it would make me blush			1
the important thing is for him not to be embarrassed , ' he snarks in the book			0
' it 's no small wonder why the culture has become so crude when fathers and mothers allow and even encourage their children to devour vulgar , misogynistic , and violent material when it 's performed by ' cool ' people like @entity3 and @entity2			1
' ' with the first lady so concerned about making sure her daughters ' bellies do n't ingest unhealthy food , how can she let their brains ingest obnoxious and toxic mental poison in the form of song lyrics ? if lived out , those lyrics would be far more devastating to someone 's health than a cupcake			2
' @entity257 ? an image apparently showing @entity19 , 16 , wearing a t - shirt for hip hop collective @entity260 was shared on @entity262 by the group , which claimed a ' mutual friend ' gave them the image @entity267 : @entity0 writes that @entity2 ' does n't need to lower herself to this type of crude exploitation to be a megastar ' @entity2 is close to the first family , performing at inaugurations and headlining @entity175 's 50th birthday party in january 2014 @entity19 attracted attention this month when the hip - hop collective @entity260 posted a photo on @entity262 in which she appeared to be wearing a $ 40 t - shirt emblazoned with their logo			1
the first daughter 's picture was shared online just days after one of @entity260 's founding members was arrested for breaking a security guard 's nose at a concert in @entity287			0
the @entity186 is investigating how the photo of the elder @entity11 daughter found its way to the group			0
@entity0 signed off from his eponymous @entity15 news show on january 3 , announcing that it would be the last episode			2
he is expected to make a final decision about whether or not to join the presidential race in the coming months			0
his first stop will be in the state where he first cruised to victory eight years ago : @entity0 is scheduled to speak at the @entity300 on january 23			0
' @entity68 , @entity301 ' also includes a chapter about the indignities of airport searches at the hands of the @entity306 – titled ' @entity307 and take it like a @entity308 ! ' ' where else would i be ordered to stand still , put up my hands , and have my personal belongings taken and searched without a warrant or probable cause ? ' he asks , referring to his frequent commercial airline flights			2
' after years of this indignity , much of the flying public thinks little of it , and they usually do n't complain			0
they just dutifully stand there , bend over , and take it like a prisoner			0
