by @entity1 reporter @entity3 surgeons have successfully rebuilt the noses of five skin cancer patients using their own tissue			1
the team rebuilt patients ’ nostrils using a revolutionary technique in which cells were taken from their nasal septum			1
one year later , all recipients were satisfied with their ability to breathe as well as the cosmetic appearance , and did not report any side effects			1
growing noses : the @entity3 team grew white , glossy cartilage in the laboratory after taking cells from the patients ' nasal septum , and were able to build new nostrils for five skin cancer patients the nose is the most common place for skin cancers other than melanoma , because of its exposure to sunlight			1
surgeons are often forced to cut away parts of cartilage from the nasal septum , ear or rib as grafts to functionally reconstruct the area from where the tumour has been removed			2
but this painful and invasive procedure involves major additional surgery , and has been associated with complications at the site from which cartilage has been removed			0
the @entity3 researchers attempted an alternative method by extracting the cartilage cells , called chondrocytes , from the nasal septum of each patient			1
success : none of the five patients suffered any side effects from their new noses one year later ( stock image ) after multiplying the cells using growth factors for two weeks , they were seeded onto collagen membranes that act as a framework or scaffold for new tissue and cultured in the lab for a further fortnight			1
this generated cartilage 40 times larger than the original biopsy			0
when the engineered grafts were ready they were shaped according to the defect and implanted , reports @entity76			0
professor @entity77 , from the @entity78 in @entity3 , said : ‘ the engineered cartilage had clinical results comparable to the current standard surgery			2
' this new technique could help the body to accept the new tissue better and to improve the stability and functionality of the nostril			0
' our success is based on the long - standing , effective integration in @entity90 between our experimental group at the @entity92 and the surgical disciplines at the @entity94			0
’ he said the breakthrough opens the way to using engineered cartilage for more challenging reconstructions in facial surgery such as the complete nose , eyelid or ear			0
the same engineered grafts are currently being tested in a parallel study for articular cartilage repair in the knee			0
however , prof @entity77 added : ‘ despite this optimism , the use of these procedures in the routine clinical practice is still rather distant , as it requires rigorous assessment of efficacy on larger cohorts of patients , and the development of business models and manufacturing paradigms that will guarantee cost effectiveness			2

@entity3 surgeons successfully rebuild five skin cancer *victim* *'s* noses
doctors used skin cells from the patients ' septum to build nostrils
one year later no patient had any side effects and could breathe normally
