by @entity0 published : 12:40 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 07:12 est , 11 march 2013 a young cancer patient whose plight touched the hearts of the nation is well on the way to completing her final wishes , which included meeting her idol @entity7			1
@entity8 , 21 , has been bravely battling bone cancer since she was 17 - years - old but learned on @entity10 this year that her condition is now terminal			1
so she drew up a list of things she would like to do both for herself and her family in the months before she dies			1
they varied from having a fake hen night and visiting the seaside with her nearest and dearest			1
crossed off the list : @entity8 with @entity7 who dropped in for a cup of tea and a sing song her story inspired @entity27 readers and hundreds got in touch to offer their support and offer what help they could			1
now , just one month on , the nursery nurse from @entity34 has achieved more than she ever thought was possible			1
' it has been really overwhelming , ' she told @entity27			1
' sometimes i 'm afraid to smile because i know i will just cry with happiness ! ' a fortnight ago she had the rather surreal experience of having @entity7 singing in her living room in @entity41 , @entity34			1
the pop star had dropped in for a cup of tea and an impromptu sing song after hearing about @entity8 's story from his friend @entity48			1
@entity50 's sister , @entity49 , 31 , told @entity27 : ' it was amazing			1
@entity7 was so normal and down to earth			1
he asked @entity50 what she had been up to and gave her baby nephew a cuddle			1
' we told him that he needed to sing otherwise we would n't let him leave ! he agreed but only after we said we 'd sing the chorus of @entity58 to @entity59 with him			2
' he had a cuppa and stayed for just under an hour			2
@entity50 was so happy , especially as she knew both her big sisters were such massive @entity63 fans ! ' his kind - hearted bandmate @entity64 is currently in @entity65 , but he sent a special note and photo to @entity50 after he was contacted by @entity68			2
rite of passage : @entity50 with two of the ' @entity71 ' who made cocktails at her fake hen do @entity50 with the magician @entity75 ( l ) who showed her some card tricks , and a message from @entity64 @entity79 also sent a big basket of goodies for @entity50 's ' fake ' hen night at the local pub , as well as a framed photo of a sunset she had taken in @entity86			1
her office is helping @entity50 's family to set up their own charity			2
' she 's been so good to me , ' @entity50 said			2
' we 're hoping to meet up soon and i owe her some big thank yous			2
' one of @entity50 's favourite days was enjoying a ' typical drunken night out ' at the @entity94 in @entity95			2
they were treated like @entity97 by the manager with free cocktails and a photographer on hand			2
' it was a really great experience			2
i felt well that day , which was unusual as i often have to escape to have a rest , ' @entity50 said			2
another experience she enjoyed was meeting the @entity108 football team - because she loves being able to treat her family			2
' my brother @entity110 has been a @entity108 fan since he was little			2
he 's 25 but he turned into a hormonal teenager when he met them ! ' she said			2
' i loved watching his reactions			2
we got to see the team training and then speak to them afterwards			2
' @entity117 ( the manager @entity117 ) gave @entity110 his jacket and whistle , which was a huge deal			0
' footballer @entity120 said : ' it was great for us to meet @entity8			1
she is an inspirational person and , when we saw that meeting us was on her wish list , we were determined to make that happen			1
' support from @entity108 : @entity50 pictured with ( from right to left ) @entity120 and @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 messages of support from @entity68 , @entity68 , who is hoping to meet @entity50 soon @entity50 on her 18th birthday with her brother @entity110 ( left ) and in remission in 2011 at her niece 's christening @entity8 has remained positive despite having trouble breathing and having to rely on a wheelchair after having a leg amputated due to the cancer			1
she is on a medication drip and is in nearly constant pain			0
' it is difficult , for instance trying to get around the shops and having people who wo n't move for you , ' @entity50 admitted			0
' but now so many people have been coming up to me and saying they 've read about my story and how inspirational i am			0
' her mother @entity154 , 58 , told @entity27 : ' @entity50 has been overwhelmed with the attention			0
some days she will cry when she receives a kind message			0
she says : " i 'm just the luckiest girl in the world			0
" and i say to her : " but @entity50 , you have cancer and you 're going to die			1
" and she replies : " yes , but look at my life right now			0
" ' she has always wanted very little and likes to help others			0
she has been emailing a girl in @entity165 , who sent her a thoughtful gift despite going through a tough time herself			0
this girl says @entity50 has taught her so much			0
' @entity50 has also ticked off other wishes including meeting the magician @entity75 who amazed her with his card tricks and completing her childcare qualifications			1
favourite day out : @entity50 , pictured with her parents , loved visiting the @entity175 in @entity95 for a ' drunken night out ' it 's magic : @entity75 showed off a number of card tricks and managed to guess which card @entity50 was thinking of mrs @entity8 said : ' @entity50 has been teaching as a nursery nurse nearby			1
it 's what she 's wanted to do from the age of 11			0
' she does one - to - ones helping them with their reading and writing			0
she is often given the more challenging ones as she has a way with her that they really respond to			0
spending time in the school makes her feel normal			0
' another rite of passage @entity50 has now experienced was her own fake hen night , replete with 44 female friends and family and some topless waiters			1
mrs @entity8 said : ' it went really well and everyone was saying the next day that it was the best one they had ever been to			1
' the @entity71 were fabulous , they sent two lovely guys who looked after us all night long and served us cocktails and did a show			0
we had special t - shirts printed and played lots of silly games			0
' @entity50 wrote on @entity209 : ' i would like to thank @entity211 and all her staff that put on a great night and for everyone that came to my no hen hen do i had a fantastic time and without crying i love you all so much and i do n't know what i 'd do without you x x x. ' @entity50 receives a manicure from former @entity222 star @entity221 @entity50 and two friends with a basket of hen do goodies @entity50 is currently receiving chemotherapy at @entity228 , @entity229			1

they are also planning a trip to @entity245 with a personal shopper and a family holiday to @entity248 thanks to an anonymous gift from a premiership footballer			0
mrs @entity8 said : ' it 's important for us that no matter how long @entity50 has left she fills each day with things that make her happy			1
' but i am a parent and when i go to bed i do think about how one day our life will be so different without her			0
' i 'm so very proud of her			0
she is remarkable in every way			0
' @entity50 met @entity7 and received a special message from @entity64 @entity50 is now setting up a charity , called @entity50 's wishes , after receiving so many donations via her website			1
it will help 18 to 24 - year - olds who have cancer , especially those who have relapsed			1
' the first time you have cancer who go in so positive , ' @entity50 said			1
' but the second time you know what 's coming and you start to question whether the treatment will work as it did n't the first time			0
' i want the charity to fund bucket list wishes whether it 's a day out or to meet someone special			1
' the wishes yet to be fulfilled on her list include meeting the @entity283 football team with her father @entity284 and prince @entity129 and @entity286			1
