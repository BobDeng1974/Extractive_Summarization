@entity1 , 21 , had no insurance when she reversed her @entity11 into another vehicle while performing a three - point - turn			1
a court heard how she fled the scene after the owner came out of his house to investigate , but returned the next day and tried to bully him into not reporting the crash			2
@entity19 heard that @entity1 , who has a four - year - old son , told the owner she would deny causing the damage and would trick police into believing her by acting ' girly and all dippy '			1
she then tried to convince the man to lie to police by saying that a neighbour caused the damage because she had eight points on her licence and had no insurance			2
unbeknown to her , however , the owner had secretly recorded @entity1 making the threats after the accident in october 2011			1
he went to police , and she was arrested			2
@entity1 , of @entity36 , @entity19 , admitting perverting the course of justice and leaving the scene of the accident			1
@entity41 , defending , told the court : ' she is young , very young and she has serious responsibilities			0
' i can see that this crossed the custody threshold but i would argue in her case that a chance can be taken with her			0
' she 's 21 , she was 19 at the time and the reality is that she lives as a single parent in her own accommodation			0
' she has full care of her young son			0
she is not a bad youngster , but clearly behaves in a thoughtless way on occasions			0
' she is not stupid but by her own behaviour she has demonstrated some poor thinking skills			0
' @entity1 's solicitor told @entity19 the defendant had ' demonstrated some poor thinking skills ' @entity1 , who lists herself as an estate agent on her @entity65 page , was handed a four - month jail term , suspended for two years , for perverting the course of justice and 14 days in prison , suspended for the same period , for the driving offences			1
judge @entity71 told @entity1 the only reason she was not imposing an immediate custodial sentence was for the welfare of her four - year - old son			1
she said : ' i think you 've been utterly manipulative , arrogant and stupid , and if you come back before this court you can expect very different treatment			2
' the picture i 'm getting here is somebody who seems to think it 's perfectly all right to drive without insurance and pretend she is just dippy			0
' judge @entity71 said @entity1 had been ' utterly manipulative , arrogant , and stupid ' judge @entity71 also drew parallels with the case of disgraced @entity89 mp @entity88 and his ex-wife @entity90 who were both jailed for eight months for perverting the course of justice			1
she told @entity94 : ' you have seen the news the sentences imposed for this type of offence			0

she refused to comment outside court last thursday .			0
