by @entity0 president @entity1 has asked @entity2 for $ 500million to arm moderate @entity4 rebels in the latest effort to tackle @entity7 militants president @entity1 has asked @entity2 for $ 500million to arm and equip moderate rebel groups in @entity4 in the latest effort to combat the sudden rise of @entity7			1
@entity1 has previously been reluctant to arm rebel groups amid fears that weapons could fall into the wrong hands , but gains by @entity7 militants in the past weeks now appear to trump those concerns			1
a lighting - fast offensive by @entity7 saw the fundamentalist @entity19 group seize huge swathes of territory in @entity22 to add to the land it already controlled in @entity4			1
the group now controls most of the country 's northwest , including all border crossings with @entity4 , and is fighting in @entity29 , just 40 miles from capital @entity30 , prompting fears the country 's security forces could be overrun			1
the train - and - equip mission would be overseen by the @entity35 and would mark a significant expansion of previous covert efforts to arm moderate rebels fighting both the extremists and forces loyal to @entity4 president @entity41			1
moderate groups fighting in @entity4 include the @entity43 of the @entity44 , the @entity45 , and the @entity46 - though it is feared this group could collaborate with more extreme groups			1
officials say the @entity50 has grown increasingly confident in recent months about its ability to distinguish the moderate rebels from the more extremist elements that include the @entity53 - inspired @entity7 , or @entity7			2
@entity55 spokeswoman @entity54 said the military assistance ' marks another step toward helping the @entity4 people defend themselves against regime attacks , push back against the growing number of extremists like @entity7 who find safe haven in the chaos , and take their future into their own hands by enhancing security and stability at local levels			1
' @entity1 has previously warned against arming rebel groups amid fears that weapons could fall into the wrong hands - however the security threat from @entity7 now appears to trump those concerns the president 's cautious approach to @entity4 has come under increased criticism as the civil war , now in its fourth year , spills across the border into @entity22 , with @entity55 opponents arguing that @entity1 's reluctance to arm the rebels gave @entity7 space to operate			1
like the more moderate @entity4 rebels , @entity7 is seeking to push @entity41 from power , aiming to carve out a purist @entity19 enclave across both sides of the @entity4 - @entity22 border			1
with @entity7 gaining strength , @entity50 officials say @entity41 's forces launched airstrikes on extremist targets inside @entity22 on monday			2
@entity1 has ruled out sending @entity50 troops back into combat in @entity22			2
but he has dispatched nearly 600 @entity50 forces in and around @entity22 to train local forces and secure the @entity97 in @entity30			0
officials said the administration would coordinate with @entity2 and regional players on the specific types of training and assistance the @entity50 would provide the opposition			0
one potential option would be to base @entity50 personnel in @entity107 and conduct the training exercise there			0
in addition to the covert train - and - equip mission , the @entity50 has also provided nearly $ 287million in nonlethal assistance to the moderate opposition			0
the military program would be supplemented by $ 1 billion in assistance to @entity4 's neighbors — @entity107 , @entity116 , @entity117 , and @entity22 — to help them deal with an influx of refugees and the threat of extremists spilling over their borders			2
the @entity4 program is part of a broader $ 65.8 billion overseas operations request that the administration sent to @entity128 on thursday			2
this week : @entity7 has now seized every border crossing between @entity22 and @entity4 , allowing tanks and troops to pass across unimpeded , and controls much of @entity22 's north the package includes $ 1 billion to help stabilize nations bordering @entity4 that are struggling with the effects of the civil war			1
it also formalizes a request for a previously announced $ 1 billion to strengthen the @entity50 military presence in @entity140 and @entity141 amid @entity143 's threatening moves in @entity144			0
the @entity143 ambassador to the @entity146 criticized @entity1 's announcement , saying it would just drag out the conflict and that it was ' moving things in the wrong direction			1
' ' i think that this is an extremely big risk , and frankly a waste , ' ambassador @entity152 told reporters at the @entity146 , saying weapons and money could fall into the hands of the @entity7			1
he said the @entity50 and @entity143 , which has been @entity41 's most powerful international backer during the war , should be focusing on restarting political negotiations to end the conflict			0
the instability in @entity22 comes as @entity1 continues to grapple with a crisis in @entity144 , with @entity143 widely believed to be backing @entity167 insurgents in eastern @entity144 cities			1
@entity143 's threats have stoked anxiety among @entity50 allies in the region , who are seeking deeper military assistance from the @entity50 @entity1 has previously cautioned against arming rebels in @entity4 amid fears that weapons could fall into the wrong hands , but the threat of @entity7 now appears to have changed his mind			1
according to reports , the @entity50 is increasingly confident in its ability to tell the more moderate groups from the fundamentalists - so who is likely to get the weapons and who will they be used against ? moderates @entity190 the @entity43 was created as an umbrella group to unite the various elements of the @entity193 as the @entity194 called for united leadership among @entity4 's rebels at the end of last year			2
fighters for the @entity43 come largely from army deserters based in @entity117 , led by @entity200			0
the group has backing from @entity203 powers such as the @entity50 , as well as @entity117 and @entity206 @entity205 countries , but has never been able to shake the impression that it is being lead from abroad			0
while still functioning nominally , the @entity43 was dealt a heavy blow by the formation of the @entity46 alliance in november 2013 , which deprived it of some of its largest members and allies			0
fighters from the @entity44 - now the @entity190 - pictured in @entity218 in 2012 @entity4 @entity219 this alliance of rebel units helped to launch the @entity4 campaign against hardline @entity7 fighters			1
the backbone of the group is the @entity226 , a once powerful group from the northern province of @entity228 led by @entity229			0
unlike most other rebel formations , the group does not appear to have strong ideological leanings			0
the @entity233 is believed to receive funding from large @entity206 countries like @entity236			0
it has poor relations with the @entity46 but has expressed support for the @entity43			0
@entity240 this recent formation of eight @entity4 militant groups was announced early in january and almost immediately launched a campaign against @entity7 , leading many observers to believe it may have been formed by @entity206 backers to challenging the radical @entity247 group			1
the @entity240 , which claims to have 5,000 members , is seen as moderately @entity247			0
this relatively new group , along with the @entity250 , spearheaded the campaign against @entity7			0
@entity251 islamic front an amalgam of six major @entity247 groups , this alliance is believed to be the biggest rebel army working in @entity4			2
its formation last november gutted the @entity203 - backed @entity259 , depriving it of some of its main members			0
analysts say the number of fighters brought together by the front is between 40,000 to 50,000			0
the @entity46 has been involved in fighting with @entity7 , making it a possible target for @entity50 weapons , but many of its members are hardline @entity271 who want @entity4 to become an @entity19 state			2
fundamentalists @entity7 @entity7 was formed by breakaway elements from the @entity275 , @entity53 's official affiliate in @entity4 , which joined with @entity53 's @entity22 branch			2
the group is headed by the @entity22 branch 's leader , known as @entity280			0
@entity7 is the most hardline of all the @entity247 forces in @entity4 and has made enemies of several rebel groups since it seized many towns and checkpoints in opposition areas			1
it aims to create an @entity19 @entity289 state stretching from the @entity290 to @entity291 , and stepped closer to that objective this week after seizing all border crossing between @entity4 and @entity22			0
@entity7 militants launched a bloody offensive on @entity22 from @entity4 attempting to establish a @entity289 state spanning both countries @entity275 this powerful rebel group is comprised of both @entity4 and foreign militants and has been formally recognized by the central leadership of @entity53 as its franchise in @entity4			1
the group was one of the first to use techniques such as suicide attacks and car bombings in urban areas			0
despite this , it is seen as more tolerant and less heavy handed in its dealings with civilians and other rebel groups in comparison with @entity7			1
the @entity275 , estimated at around 7,000 to 8,000 members , has worked with most rebel factions fighting in @entity4 but follows an austere version of @entity19 and calls for the creation of an @entity19 state .			2
