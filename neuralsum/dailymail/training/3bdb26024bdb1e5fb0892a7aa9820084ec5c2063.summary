by @entity0 when it comes to personal assistant apps , @entity1 and @entity2 lead the way with their @entity7 and @entity8 services			1
but @entity1 may be trying to establish itself even further in the market , and steal an edge on its rival , following the purchase of @entity14			2
@entity14 is similar to @entity7 because it predicts what users want to do next , and offers relevant help - but it goes one step further			1
the firm claims the @entity14 app uses artificial intelligence to learn behaviours and fine tune suggestions in real time			1

for example , @entity1 now alerts people to an upcoming flight , and informs them of traffic or public transport conditions before they leave			0
it can also remind people to take an umbrella , if it looks like it ’s going to rain			0
the software in prediction apps is based on an algorithm that combines various snippets of information to form a prediction			2
in the case of personal - assistant apps , the software scans calendar entries to work out where a user is , or should be			1
it combines this with location data , taken from the device 's gps unit , as well as posts on social networks , email information and more			2
it will then present the user with the help it thinks they need			0
for example , if a calendar on an @entity68 phone contains a diary invite , @entity7 will create a reminder			1
it will then check to see whether the user is en route to the meeting and add directions to this reminder , or work out how long it will take them to get there based on current traffic			0
@entity14 is slightly more advanced because it additionally scans and monitors conversations , in real time , to offer these suggestions automatically , and with context			1
if a friend asks a user where they are , @entity14 can send the location on a map , or if a friend asks to meet up on a particular day , @entity14 will check the user ’s calendar to see if they ’re free automatically			1

@entity14 was founded in 2012 by @entity117 - based ex-google and @entity2 employee @entity118			1
its ‘ machine learning ’ capabilities could provide @entity7 with added context and faster response times , across different devices			1
the @entity14 team confirmed the acquisition in a blog post on wednesday : ‘ hey , did you hear ? we ’re joining @entity1 ! ‘ that ’s right ! and we ’re super-excited			2
but to focus on our next chapter , we have to close the last one			0
‘ as of august 25 , 2014 , we ’ll be shutting down the @entity14 app. ‘ it will no longer be available in the @entity131 , and existing users wo n’t be able to send , receive , or download messages			1
we know it ’s an inconvenience , and we regret that			0
‘ to our friends , advisors , and users : we ’ve learned so much with your help , and we ’re grateful for all your support			2

the acquistion was confirmed in a blog post on wednesday , but details of the deal have not been revealed it is not known how much @entity1 paid for @entity14 , and @entity148 has contacted the company for more information			2
this is n’t @entity1 ’s first foray into artificial intelligence			0
in january , the firm bought artificial intelligence firm @entity154			0
its @entity156 search update last year was created to make @entity1 ' more human ' , and searches can now understand context , like a human brain , for example			0
@entity1 also hired futurist @entity161 as engineering director in 2012			0
@entity161 has famously claimed that in just over 30 years , humans will be able to upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - an event called singularity			0
he also claimed the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100 .			0

@entity14 was founded by @entity174 and @entity2 employee @entity118
it works in a similar way to personal assistant apps @entity7 and @entity8
but , @entity14 claims it is different because the app relies on ‘ machine learning ’
this means it can learn behaviours and fine tune suggestions for users
it works by monitoring conversations for contextual data , in real time
if someone asks to meet up , it automatically checks a calendar , for example
