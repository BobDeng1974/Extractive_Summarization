' inhuman ' : @entity58 claims he is not being treated like a human by being held in @entity4 ' pain ' : the prisoner claims he is painfully forcibly fed twice a day - tied down for hours at a time and attended to by nurses how are too busy to give each patient proper attention @entity58 ’s opinion piece appeared in the @entity32 after he spoke to his lawyers at legal charity reprieve			1
he writes : ‘ the only reason i am still here is that president @entity33 refuses to send any detainees back to @entity1			1
‘ this makes no sense			2
i am a human being , not a passport , and i deserve to be treated like one			2
‘ i do not want to die here , but until president @entity33 and @entity1 ’s president do something , that is what i risk every day			1
' on march 15 al @entity0 was sick in the prison hospital when a team from the @entity81 , which was eight military officers in riot gear , came into his room			1
he writes : ‘ they tied my hands and feet to the bed			2
‘ they forcibly inserted an iv into my hand			2
i spent 26 hours in this state , tied to the bed			2
during this time i was not permitted to go to the toilet			2
' agony ' : the inmate claims he has ' never experienced such pain before ' and says he would n't wish it on anybody undignified : the inmate claims he is forced to stay in soiled clothes because food is spilled by nurses ‘ they inserted a catheter , which was painful , degrading and unnecessary			2
i was not even permitted to pray			0
‘ i will never forget the first time they passed the feeding tube up my nose			0
i ca n’t describe how painful it is to be force - fed this way			1
as it was thrust in , it made me feel like throwing up			0

‘ there was agony in my chest , throat and stomach			0
i had never experienced such pain before			0
i would not wish this cruel punishment upon anyone			0
’ @entity58 writes that he is still being force fed two times a day and that his arms , legs and head are strapped down each time they come , which can be as late as 11pm when he is asleep			0
he also claims that because there are so many on hunger strike there are not enough medical personnel to keep up			0
' the situation is desperate now			0
all of the detainees here are suffering deeply			0
at least 40 people here are on a hunger strike			0
people are fainting with exhaustion every day			0
i have vomited blood , ' he writes			0
as a result @entity143 says that the few nurses available are so rushed they spill the ‘ food ’ onto the prisoners ’ clothes which he claims denies him ‘ last shred of my dignity ’ he writes : ‘ during one force - feeding the nurse pushed the tube about 18 inches into my stomach , hurting me more than usual , because she was doing things so hastily			2
‘ i called the interpreter to ask the doctor if the procedure was being done correctly or not			0
it was so painful that i begged them to stop feeding me			0
the nurse refused to stop feeding me			0
‘ @entity58 is one of the more obscure of the 166 detainees still being held at @entity4			1
the @entity52 alleges he worked security for @entity3 but he denies knowing the former terror leader			1
he claims that he is not a terrorist and that he only traveled from @entity1 to @entity7 in 2000 when a childhood friend told him he could earn more than the $ 50 a month he was earning in a factory			1
when he got there there was no work and after the @entity52 invaded in 2001 he left for @entity6 where he was arrested and sent to @entity4			1
he writes : ‘ i could have been home years ago - no one seriously thinks i am a threat - but still i am here			1
‘ years ago the military said i was a ' guard ' for @entity3 , but this was nonsense , like something out of the @entity52 movies i used to watch			1
‘ they do n’t even seem to believe it anymore			0
but they do n’t seem to care how long i sit here , either			0
