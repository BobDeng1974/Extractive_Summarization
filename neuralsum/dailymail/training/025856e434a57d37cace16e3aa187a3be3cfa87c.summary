by @entity0 , @entity2 correspondent and @entity3 published : 18:01 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 11:52 est , 16 october 2013 these pictures show police officers interrupting a sham wedding between a @entity8 man living illegally in the @entity9 and a @entity11 woman			1
@entity13 immigration officers swooped on the ceremony , which was held at a registry office in @entity16 , @entity17			1
the man , 32 , has now been sent back to @entity8 , and the woman , 22 , is on bail until november 7			1
she is on bail until november 7 broadcast on @entity31 this morning , immigration officers said the woman may have married for cash on three separate occasions			1
police interrupted the marriage in front of guests and took the bride and groom for questioning separately			1
it emerged that they knew little about each other and that the man was working in the @entity9 illegally			1
@entity46 leader @entity45 said : ' it is appalling to see the lengths some people go to in dressing up and organising guests for a sham marriage			0
' a marriage is supposed to be the happiest day in your life			0
well , in this case , the couple certainly got a day they wo n’t forget			0
' immigration officers question the @entity8 man , 32 , after interrupting his sham marriage ceremony according to police , the 22 - year - old woman may have married for cash on three separate occasions questioning by police revealed the couple knew little about each other and that the man was in the illegally the photographs and footage come after it emerged yesterday that one in five civil marriages in parts of @entity9 may be bogus			1
some 15,000 such ceremonies a year are taking place simply to get around immigration law , estimates one of the country ’s most senior registrars , @entity78			1
last year the @entity13 received nearly 1,900 warnings about potentially bogus unions			1
but mr @entity78 , the chairman of the @entity83 , said that figure represented ‘ the tip of a very large iceberg ’			1
he said that in urban areas , up to 20 per cent of marriages are ‘ suspicious ’			2
he estimated that overall , 15,000 of the 173,000 civil weddings each year in @entity90 and @entity91 could be fake unions designed to evade immigration laws			2
registrars were powerless to prevent couples they suspected of faking their relationships from marrying and were forced to conduct the ceremonies ‘ through gritted teeth ’ , he said			0
@entity78 , chairman of the @entity83 , said official figures are the ' tip of a very large iceberg ' mr @entity78 said the problem was worse than at its high point in 2004 because laws drawn up since then to deal with the problem had been watered down by a series of human rights judgments to the point where they were ‘ meaningless ’			1
last week ministers announced a major crackdown on sham weddings , with laws designed to ensure every potential sham wedding is reported and investigated before it happens			1
it also gives officials more power to delay the ceremony taking place by up to 70 days			0
official figures show that the number of reported cases has tripled in the last three years			0
in 2009 some 561 reports were lodged with officials , a figure which nearly doubled in a year to 934 in 2010			0
by 2011 it stood at 1,741 and last year 1,891			0
@entity13 officials admit that the figure is likely to severely underestimate the scale of the problem			2
they put the likely number of sham weddings at between four and ten thousand a year			2
but mr @entity78 says the problem is even worse than that			1
he claims only the most blatant cases are flagged up and ‘ borderline ’ weddings which are slightly suspicious go unreported			0
‘ we have seen huge increases in potential sham marriages presenting themselves to us , we now have more reports from registrars going to the @entity13 , but i think that is the tip of a very large iceberg , and effectively the real scale of the problem is far greater than that reported to the @entity13 officially , ’ he told a @entity31 investigation			1
‘ most registration officers are not immigration officers , they came into this business to facilitate marriage			0
immigration minister @entity149 said extending the notice period for marriages there will be more time to investigate and prosecute those involved in sham marriages pugh page 8.jpg ‘ so therefore they do n’t want to be cynical , unfortunately therefore what happens is , the ones that are absolutely blatant get reported and there are some that are borderline that slip through without being reported – and that is the iceberg under the water and that ’s huge – it is absolutely huge			2
‘ in an area like anywhere in @entity17 it is multiple times per week			2
it would not be unreasonable to say that 20 per cent of all our marriages are suspicious , have some elements of suspicion about them			2
very often the ceremony is done through gritted teeth			0
’ @entity180 weddings became a major problem in the early 2000s and @entity182 passed a law in 2004 requiring couples including one foreign national to get an approval certificate from the @entity13 before they could wed. but this was watered down by a series of legal judgments on challenges under @entity191 of the @entity192			2
as a result , mr @entity78 said , the law became ‘ meaningless ’			1
ministers say new measures announced will provide registrars better powers to deal with sham weddings			0
when the @entity203 becomes law , every proposed marriage in which a @entity200 national will gain rights to be in @entity9 will be reported to the @entity13			1
@entity206 , 22 , has been jailed for 12 months for plotting a sham wedding a @entity209 student and a @entity11 woman were sent to prison for 12 months after they were found guilty of plotting a sham wedding so he could remain in the @entity9			1
@entity206 , 22 , admitted to police that she had agreed to marry @entity216 , 23 , for £ 1,340			0
@entity217 arrived in the @entity9 a few weeks before the wedding was due to take place and visited a register office with @entity216 to give notice to marry			2
despite only being in the @entity9 for 24 hours , she opened a bank account and received a national insurance number			0
the pair were arrested in april this year at a register office in @entity16 , north @entity17 , and confessed to conspiracy to facilitate a breach of immigration rules			1
the notice period for marriages and civil partnerships will be increased from 15 days to 28 days for all couples , and officials will be able to increase that to 70 days in suspicious cases			0
foreign nationals from outside the @entity237 wanting to get married in a church will first have to go to the register office and get approval – ensuring the authorities are made aware of the planned wedding			0
immigration minister @entity149 said : ‘ @entity180 marriages have for too long been an easy target for migrants seeking to circumvent our immigration rules , often assisted by organised criminals			0
‘ by extending the marriage and civil partnership notice period to 28 days and allowing this to be increased to 70 days in some circumstances , we will make time to investigate , prosecute and remove those involved in sham marriages			0
