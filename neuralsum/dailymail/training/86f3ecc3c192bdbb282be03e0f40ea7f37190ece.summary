by @entity1 reporter published : 06:19 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 19:13 est , 31 january 2014 a woman who called the @entity5 helpline died while waiting for a doctor to ring her back			1
the service is supposed to cater for ‘ urgent healthcare needs ’ , but when the 33 - year - old felt unwell and dialled the number , she was simply told to wait for a return call			0
by the time it came , it appears she was already dead			0
the woman contacted the phone line for people in need of ‘ fast medical help ’ , on december 22 after feeling unwell and was told to wait for a doctor			1
rapid deterioration : the 33 - year - old woman , who has not been named , became seriously ill while she waited for a doctor to call her back after dialling the @entity5 's non-emergency 111 phone number ( @entity26 picture ) by the time she was called back - around two hours later - she did not answer and an ambulance was sent to her home , but it was too late			1
now @entity5 managers have told @entity32 , the private company operating the 111 call centre , to carry out an inquiry to see if the tragedy in @entity37 , south @entity38 , could have been prevented			1
board papers presented to the @entity40 said the woman 's condition had deteriorated rapidly in the two - hour gap			1
the 111 helpline was roundly criticised after it was launched last year , with some claiming they had to wait 11 hours for a call back			2
the @entity40 , the @entity5 body which pays @entity32 to run the helpline for the area , admitted this week : ‘ a serious incident occurred where … the patient ’s condition deteriorated prior to the gp returning the call within the two - hour timeframe			1
’ emergency : by the time an ambulance arrived at the woman 's home she was critically ill and died moments later , an initial investigation said ( @entity26 picture ) the controversial helpline was launched in april 2013 to replace a previous non-emergency service and enable people to contact a doctor without the need to going to overcrowded @entity71 units			1
staff shortages have made the @entity5 helpline unsafe at weekends , say its own managers			0
some call centres have no nurses at all overnight , leaving unqualified workers to make snap decisions about the critically ill. an undercover investigation also found patients can wait hours to speak to a nurse			2
dr @entity82 of @entity32 said : ‘ early findings suggest that this was a complex case assessed through @entity5 , including input from a clinician , and that there was unexpected and rapid deterioration in the patient			2
’ he also told local paper the @entity91 : ' we would like to offer our sincerest condolences to the family for their tragic loss			0
' we notified the @entity96 of the incident and , as is the case with any unexpected death , a multi-agency investigation was immediately launched			2
' ' early findings suggest that this was a complex case assessed through @entity5 111 , including input from a clinician , and that there was an unexpected and rapid deterioration in the patient			0
' however , while the investigation remains ongoing and until all the facts are known , we can not comment further			0
' dr @entity109 , assistant clinical chairman of @entity96 said : ' we are taking this matter seriously , and our sympathies are with their friends and family at what must be a very difficult time			0
' a detailed investigation is already under way to find out what happened and we will be able to say more once that investigation has been completed			0
