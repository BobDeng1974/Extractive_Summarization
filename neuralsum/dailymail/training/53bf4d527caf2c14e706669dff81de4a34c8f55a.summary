but when @entity4 decided to burn some pine needles to clear his lawn , this was the disastrous result			1
after starting an incinerator to burn the waste , the 88 - year - old checked twice that it was ‘ smoking nicely ’ before heading indoors , believing the fire was under control			1
just moments later , a spark shot from the burner on to a wooden fence , turning his small garden fire into a huge blaze which caused thousands of pounds worth of damage			1
blaze : the inferno destroyed four garden sheds and their contents , a neighbour 's £ 4,000 summerhouse , a children 's trampoline and sections of fencing separating four houses hot spot : the retired engineer only realised something was wrong when wife @entity33 , 85 , told him their back garden was on fire			2
by that stage his neighbours had already alerted the fire brigade and officers quickly extinguished the blaze feeling the heat : pensioner @entity4 was shocked as he looked at the damage the fire in the garden of his bungalow home in @entity48 had caused with flames shooting 25ft into the air , the fire spread to the gardens of four neighbouring houses , destroying four garden sheds as well as fencing , and seriously damaging a £ 4,000 summerhouse and a trampoline			1
while a neighbour tried to kill the flames using his garden hose , mr @entity4 was oblivious – until his wife @entity33 , 85 , told him she could see flames			1
by that stage his neighbours had already alerted the fire brigade and officers quickly extinguished the blaze			0
today , surveying the damage in his garden of his bungalow home in @entity48 , @entity70 , @entity4 said : ' i ’m sorry it happened			2
' he added : ' i thought it was a good day to get the incinerator out			0
i wanted to burn some of the pine needles that had fallen from the tree			0
' i looked out of the window twice in the space of half an hour and it was smoking nicely			0
i thought i had it under control			2
' when i looked for a third time a few minutes later there were flames shooting upwards and spreading to the branches of my pine tree and my neighbour ’s fence			0
shock : mr @entity4 said ' when i looked for a third time a few minutes later there were flames shooting upwards and spreading to the branches of my pine tree and my neighbour 's fence ' mr @entity4 looked shocked as he surveyed the damage to his garden and his neighbours			1
' a spark must have flown onto the wooden fence next to it and set everything ablaze			1
somebody had already called the fire brigade and they were here before i could get outside			0
' they told me to keep away from it			0
the fire had spread to my two garden sheds			0
once it set fire to my fence the flames quickly spread to my neighbours ’ fences that back on to my garden , ' mr @entity4 added			1
ruined : neighbour @entity115 , whose home backs onto mr @entity4 's property , lost his beloved summerhouse in the fire			1
