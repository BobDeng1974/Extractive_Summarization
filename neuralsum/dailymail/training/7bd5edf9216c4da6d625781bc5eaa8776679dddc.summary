a cemetery containing more than a million mummified human bodies has been unearthed in central @entity2 , according to archaeologists			1
scientists have already excavated more than 1,700 mummies , preserved by the hot dry desert in the @entity8 region of @entity2 about 60 miles ( 96km ) south of @entity9			1
but those leading the work believe their could be up to a million similar bodies buried in shafts cut into the limestone rock that are at times up to 75ft ( 22.9 metres ) deep			1
unlike many famous mummified remains discovered in @entity2 , these were found in mass graves and appear to be ordinary citizens rather than royalty or other important figures			1
prehistoric @entity2 pre – 3100 bc @entity2 early dynastic period 3100 – 2686 bc @entity33 2686 – 2181 bc @entity34 2181 – 2055 bc @entity35 2055 – 1650 bc 2nd intermediate period 1650 – 1550 bc @entity37 * 1550 – 1069 bc 3rd intermediate period 1069 – 664 bc late period 664 – 332 bc @entity39 @entity40 @entity2 525 – 332 bc @entity41 332 – 30 bc @entity42 30 bc – 641 ad @entity43 @entity2 621 – 629 @entity44 @entity45 641 – 969 @entity46 @entity2 969 – 1171 ayyubid @entity2 1171 – 1250 @entity48 1250 – 1517 early modern @entity50 1517 – 1867 @entity52 occupation 1798 – 1801 @entity2 under @entity53 1805 – 1882 @entity54 1867 – 1914 @entity55 @entity57 occupation 1882 – 1953 @entity58 1914 – 1922 @entity59 1922 – 1953 republic 1953 – present * @entity62 period from which tomb @entity63 is believed to originate			1
yet scientists are baffled about where the huge numbers of mummies came from - the remains of a nearby village is too small to warrant such a large cemetery and the nearest town , named @entity73 after @entity74 , has its own burial sites			1
archaeologists have also uncovered a bizarre range of mummies , including one man who is more than seven feet ( 213 cm ) tall			1
they have also discovered that the mummies appear to be clustered together by hair colour , with those with blond hair in one area and all of those with red hair in another			1
professor @entity88 , project director of the excavation at @entity90 , in @entity91 , said : ' the cemetery is densely populated			2
' in a square that is 5 x 5 meters across and usually just over 2 meters deep , we will typically find about 40 burials			2
' the cemetery is very large , and so far seems to maintain that kind of burial density throughout			0
' thus the maths suggests that there are over a million mummies in the cemetery , though we can not be certain of this without further exploration and a thorough academic review process			2
' although the @entity20 necropolis , which is named after a nearby road that translates as ' way of the @entity110 ' , was first discovered nearly 30 years ago , archaeologists are still trying to piece together what they have found there			1
annual excavations at the site , on the eastern edge of the @entity8 region , near the city of @entity118 , regularly unearth mummified remains and professor @entity88 presented the latest discoveries at the @entity122 at the @entity123 last month			1
among the recent discoveries made last year were the mummified remains of a little girl aged around 18 months old , still with two bracelets on each arm			1
unlike royal @entity132 mummies , the people buried at @entity130 had few goods buried with them and were laid in the ground without coffins			2
their internal organs were also rarely removed , an important part of the mummification process , so it is the arid environment of the desert that is largely thought to have preserved the bodies			2
however , with the latest discovery of the little girl , professor @entity88 said there appears to have also been some attempt by those who buried her to use the full mummification process			2
writing on the team 's @entity148 page , which professor @entity88 only recently updated in an attempt to keep the discoveries secret , said : ' this mummy was beautifully wrapped in a tunic and with other nice wrappings			0
many bodies were found in clusters , like these wrapped remains of two children and two adults bodies tended to be clustered by hair colour , like this one with long blonde hair that is thought to be female ' there was some evidence that they tried much of the full mummification process			1
the toes and toenails and brain and tongue were amazingly preserved			0
' we found a wonderful necklace and two bracelets on each arm			0
the jewellery makes us think it was a girl , but we can not tell			0
' she was buried with great care as someone who obviously loved her very much did all they could to take care of this little girl in burial			2
' but they succeeded , it was a beautiful burial			0
she had been buried with several other mummies , so we are interested in examining them			2
' another woman , with long blonde hair , was found buried among a group of other bodies that all had healthy sets of teeth			1
professor @entity88 said : ' quite a few of our mummies had excellent teeth , something that is unusual			0
scientists have already excavated more than 1,700 mummies , preserved by the hot dry desert in the @entity8 region of @entity2 about 60 miles ( 96km ) south of @entity9			1
they believe there are around a million to be found the mummies were found in deep shafts hacked into the limestone bedrock beneath the surface of the desert more than 1,700 bodies have been recovered from the 300 acre site since it was discovered 30 years ago ' one wonders if it is genetics that caused a group that may be related to each other to have better teeth than the norm			1
' of course we do n't know that they are related just because they are buried near each other , but throughout the history of the world it is common for families to be buried near each other			0
' it seems likely , but we can not assume			0
' he added : ' the cemetery is largely a @entity42 period cemetery , located in the @entity8 area of @entity2			1
' the burials are not in tombs , but rather in a field of sand			0
the people in the cemetery represent the common man			2
' they are the average people who are usually hard to learn about because they are not very visible in written sources			0
' they were poor , yet they put a tremendous amount of their resources into providing beautiful burials			0
' with the cemetery stretching over 300 acres , professor @entity88 believes there are many more secrets to be uncovered in its burial shafts			1
a small pyramid built nearby to the cemetery more than 4,500 years ago - two millennia before the cemetery was first used - may also hold some more clues as to what these people were doing here			0
' it 's hard to know where all these people were coming from , ' professor @entity88 told @entity261			0
many of the best preserved bodies have been wrapped in linen or reeds , which together with the dry desert climate has helped to mummify the remains , although some bodies had also had their organs removed researchers conduct annual excavations at the site but believe there could be a million bodies buried there while some of the discoveries at @entity20 show a surprising degree of good health , such as having full sets of teeth , mummies from ancient @entity2 have shown that @entity283 had quite unhealthy lifestyles			1
scans of 4,000 - year - old mummies have revealed evidence of hardening of the arteries – a condition which can lead to heart attacks and strokes			0
earlier studies had revealed fatty arteries in a large number of @entity132 mummies but critics had dismissed the find as related to their luxurious , fatty diets			0
much of the discoveries have yet to be properly published as the archaeologists have been reluctant to reveal the exact location of the cementery			0
professor @entity88 described how one mummy was found folded in half in order to fit him into the burial shaft			1
he believes that the man , who was over 7ft tall ( 213cm ) may have suffered from a medical condition caused by an excess of growth hormone , but said more research needs to be done to prove this			2
he also believes that some of the clusters by hair colour may actually be due to people being buried in family groups and so are related			0
he hopes that genetic testing may be possible to help show how some of the mummies were related to each other			0
together with the bodies , archaeologists have also discovered glass beads , linen , jewelry and even colourful children 's boots			1
' a lot of their wealth , as little as they had , was poured into these burials , ' said professor @entity88			0
this skeleton was found entombed inside an unusual triangle shaped vault at the bottom of a burial shaft			0

the @entity20 cemetery stretches over 300 acres in @entity8 , @entity2
mummified human bodies found in shafts up to 75 feet deep in the desert
remains date from when @entity2 was under @entity24 and @entity25 control
an 18 month old girl is among the most recent mummies to be discovered
mummified body of a seven feet tall man also found folded into one grave
@entity356 is providing archaeologists with an insight into ordinary citizens
but the reason for so many bodies being buried at site remains a mystery
