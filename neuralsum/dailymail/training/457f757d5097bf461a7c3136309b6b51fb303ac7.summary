@entity1 's fantastic free - kick denied @entity2 their second win in a week as @entity2 were held to a 1 - 1 draw in their international friendly against @entity7 in @entity8			1
the @entity11 defender 's 25 - yard strike flew past helpless @entity2 goalkeeper @entity12 10 minutes from time as the hosts warmed up for their @entity15 qualifying campaign with a fine result against the competition hosts			2
@entity19 's men took an early lead through @entity22 's strike but could not follow up victory against @entity24 on thursday with another win at @entity26			1
celebration : a scorching free kick from defender @entity1 earned @entity7 a 1 - 1 friendly draw tough : @entity1 put in a strong display for @entity7 despite @entity32 's unconvincing 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation down : @entity33 sits on the pitch crestfallen after @entity2 lost their 1 - 0 advantage over @entity7 @entity37 : @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity1 , @entity42 ( @entity43 61 ) , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 ( @entity47 61 ) , @entity48 ( @entity49 82 ) , @entity50 ( @entity51 75 ) subs : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 bookings : @entity61 , @entity47 goals : @entity1 80 @entity2 xi : @entity12 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 ( @entity69 82 ) , @entity22 ( @entity70 74 ) , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 ( @entity74 60 ) , @entity33 ( @entity75 60 ) subs : @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 bookings : @entity71 , @entity22 goals : @entity22 13 @entity22 's strike from close range punctuated a slow opening , with the @entity91 midfielder finding space at the back post to smash high into the net from @entity96 's corner			1
the visitors continued to control the tempo but were given a let - off when @entity45 curled wide from just outside the area following a fluid @entity7 counter-attack			0
@entity7 came even closer in the lead up to half - time as @entity103 defender @entity39 crashed a header against the bar from @entity45 's free - kick , while @entity46 fired inches wide after @entity2 had failed to clear a corner			1
however , having been under pressure , @entity2 nearly doubled their advantage as @entity96 saw his strike on the edge of the box palmed away by @entity7 goalkeeper @entity38			2
@entity7 thought they had levelled proceedings when @entity1 fired past @entity12 but the effort was quickly chalked off for offside , while at the other end @entity22 saw his effort punched away by @entity38 , who then denied @entity33 's poor finish from close range			2
@entity123 saw two long range efforts kept out by @entity12 but he would not be denied by his @entity126 compatriot a third time as his stunning left - footed effort levelled matters			0
@entity72 upended @entity45 25 yards from goal and @entity123 , following a lay - off , stepped up to fire low into the corner past @entity134 goalkeeper @entity12			0
@entity2 desperately tried to get back into the ascendancy but found themselves lacking a decisive touch , with substitute @entity75 just as ineffective as @entity33 had been in the opening hour of the contest			0
indeed , it was @entity7 who nearly nicked a winner at the death as @entity39 was once again denied by the woodwork			0
the defender was once again in the thick of the action from a set - piece as he headed against a post from @entity45 's inswinging corner as both sides settled for a draw			0
good start : @entity2 took an early lead in the 13th minute via former @entity154 player @entity22 strike : the goal fired the @entity15 hosts ahead on sunday but @entity2 could do little to hold on to their lead race : having beaten @entity24 1 - 0 in @entity161 on thursday , @entity2 dominated long spells of the match on sunday			1

an @entity1 free - kick earned @entity7 a 1 - 1 draw against @entity2
@entity22 's early goal fired the @entity15 hosts ahead on sunday night
@entity2 beat @entity24 1 - 0 in @entity161 on thursday and dominated long spells
@entity32 will have drawn *positives* from his debut as @entity7 's coach but his 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation *ultimately* looked unconvincing
