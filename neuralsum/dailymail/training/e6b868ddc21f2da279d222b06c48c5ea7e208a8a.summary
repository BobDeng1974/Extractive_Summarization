for nearly 20 years , @entity7 knew nothing of the whereabouts of her son , @entity10 , after his grandparents vanished from their trailer in @entity13 , @entity14 with the young boy			1
they had been raising the child at their home and are believed to have taken off with him as they were unhappy with the court granting mrs @entity7 custody for a trial period			1
but now detectives have tracked him down through his social security number and discovered the 24 - year - old living 680 miles away in @entity24 , @entity25 under the name @entity27			1
' it 's such a relief that he 's been found and that he 's alive and that he 's healthy , ' she said			2

' i know he 's married and he has a child on the way			0
i 've seen pictures of him			0

missed : the boy was taken amid a custody battle between his mother and paternal grandparents when @entity10 was tracked down this past fall , he admitted to police that he knew his real name , though he had been living under a different alias almost his entire life			1
@entity25 officials say the grandparents , now using the names @entity73 and @entity74 , verified @entity10 ' identity			1
authorities said they do not know what they had told him about their swift departure from @entity14 18 years ago			2
but when he was five and caught in the middle of the custody battle , he said he wanted to live with his grandparents , the @entity33 reported			2
' he appears to be well adjusted , there was no indication or signs of any kind of abuse over the years , ' @entity85 sgt @entity84 told @entity91			0
' it just appears on its face that his grandparents raised him as their own child over these last 18 years			0
' before the abduction , @entity10 ' paternal grandparents , then known as @entity10 and @entity96 , were raising the young boy as his mother had had a troubled relationship with their son			1
child welfare services stepped in after she ended up in a homeless shelter and because she has some developmental disabilities , @entity7 's attorney @entity104 told the @entity33			1
but in 1994 , when she was living in her own home , working and remarried , she began fighting to regain custody of her son			1
however , the grandparents were upset about the court proceedings			0
just days before @entity10 ' mother was due to take him for a one week visitation in july 1994 , he disappeared without a trace			1
' the grandparents went to the bank , drew $ 5,000 out of a home equity line and stopped for breakfast at a local restaurant , ' @entity104 said			2
that was the last time they were seen in the town			0
detectives followed his grandparents ' bank account , tracked down family members as far away as @entity128 and monitored a cabin in @entity130 that the grandparents owned , but there was no sign of little @entity10			2
the break in the case came in september 2012 , when the boy 's step - father , @entity55 , came to @entity85 with the missing child 's social security card - asking if they could run the numbers again , he told the @entity33			1
long way from home : @entity10 was found 680 miles from the trailer where he disappeared the search turned up a man with the same number and date of birth living in @entity25			1
police then found that a driver 's license photo for the man appeared to resemble @entity10			2
when local @entity25 police tracked down the man , he admitted that he was @entity10			1
his grandparents were living in another small @entity25 town eight miles north of @entity24			1
after the abduction in the 1990s , arrest warrants were issued for both grandparents , charging them with interference with custody , a @entity159			2
in 1999 , the charges were boosted to a @entity161 , but in 2008 , with neither the child nor the grandparents being located , the charges were dropped			0
and now , despite tearing @entity10 away from his biological parents 18 years ago , the grandparents have not been charged , @entity84 said			2
however , authorities in @entity25 are still investigating the case , and it will eventually be passed on to the @entity170 's office			2
police said they did not know whether @entity10 was planning a reunion with his biological mother , and he has been unable to travel to their home so far			1
' to get this dropped in his lap at age 24 , after all these years , @entity175 knows that it 's something he 'll have work out for himself , ' @entity84 said .			0
