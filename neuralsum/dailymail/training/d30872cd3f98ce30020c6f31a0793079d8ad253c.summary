he dodged @entity2 bullets on @entity3 , then was shot in the leg and was unable to move for 48 hours before being rescued			1
but despite risking his life for his country , 90 - year - old @entity5 is left with just £ 10 a week from his war pension because the council takes the rest to pay for his care			1
yesterday the proud great - grandfather , who was 19 when he landed on @entity13 in 1944 , said : ' i think it stinks			1
i 'm not being nasty and i 'm not being funny , but i 've got injuries , and they want to take it away from me			0
' @entity3 veteran @entity5 , 90 , is left with just £ 10 a week from his war pension - the rest pays for his care he is among thousands of injured former servicemen and women forced to pay for social care because they were injured on or before april 5 , 2005			1
veterans on the @entity24 , which was introduced for those injured after april 6 , 2005 , do not have to pay towards their care			2
the @entity27 is campaigning for an end to the ' profoundly unfair ' system , and is calling on the government to set aside funding so all injured veterans receive the social care they need			2
mr @entity5 , of the @entity32 , @entity33 , was seriously injured when he and his company came under @entity36 attack two weeks into the @entity38 assault on occupied @entity39 after the @entity41 landings			1
he was left lying where he was until eventually being picked up by an @entity38 tank two days later – and was the only member of his platoon to return home alive			2
the injury left him with one leg shorter than the other , which has affected his mobility			0
twenty years ago , he was assessed as being 50 per cent disabled as a result of his service and was awarded a war pension as compensation			1
the pension is now worth £ 105 per week , plus a £ 54 mobility supplement			1
outraged : mr @entity5 's family , pictured together on his 90th birthday , are campaigning for a rule change so free care applies to all injured soldiers , not just those hurt after 2005 under current rules , veterans injured before april 6 , 2005 , must hand over most of their weekly war pension payments should they need social care			1
this applies to veterans of the @entity67 , @entity68 , the @entity69 , @entity70 and the first @entity71			0
it is possible for councils to exempt the war pension from means testing for care costs – but only 12 per cent of authorities do so			1
servicemen wounded after april 2005 are entitled to keep all their payments because they are paid out of a different scheme – the @entity24			0
councils are instructed to fully exempt payments made under this programme from any means testing for social care			2
veterans injured in service on or before april 2005 receive a @entity88 and are known as @entity89			2
an estimated 4,000 injured former servicemen and women across the @entity92 are currently being forced to use war pensions to pay carers			2
the @entity27 said some veterans are so concerned at losing their pensions if they need care they have considered moving to areas which will not take it			0
the @entity100 is looking at the policy and how it should be applied in the future			0
the former caretaker then moved into a nursing home in @entity105 , @entity106 after a series of falls			2
however his family and the @entity27 say the council takes all but £ 10 of the £ 105 to pay for the nursing home costs			1
he keeps the mobility payout and the council also leaves him £ 24.50 a week personal spending allowance , which comes from his other pensions			2
daughter - in - law @entity116 , 55 , a primary school teacher from @entity105 , said : ' i understand care needs to be paid for but the war pension is something we feel is compensation for how he suffered while fighting for our country			1
' although his heating and food is paid for at the home the extra money could be put towards him coming home for sunday lunch in a taxi which caters to wheelchairs ... [ or ] a specially adapted hotel for our yearly holiday to the @entity136			0
he deserves one holiday a year while he still can			0
' mr @entity5 's wife @entity138 , a switchboard worker at an insurance company , died of cancer in 1996 at the age of 65			1
but his sons @entity143 , 58 , a teacher , and @entity145 , 62 , who is in insurance , are also angry about the money			0
@entity27 director general @entity148 said : ' not only is it unfair that war pensioners such as mr @entity5 are treated less favourably than a veteran injured at a later date , but it 's also unfair that their compensation is seen as normal income in means tests for care			1
' hero : mr @entity5 was part of the force that stormed @entity162 beach in 1944 , pictured , but was shot and injured and left for two days surrounded by his dead platoon until he was rescued last night mps and other veterans ' campaigners also called for an end to the loophole			1
mp @entity169 , a member of the defence select committee , said : ' we owe our lives and our freedom to men like @entity5 , and the nation must show it values that while the @entity3 veterans are still with us			0
' @entity69 veteran @entity177 said : ' the importance of people serving their country did n't begin in 2005			0
everyone is entitled to fair play but the older generation of veterans is not getting that – they are being discriminated against			0
' brigadier ( ret 'd ) @entity186 , from @entity187 , said : ' the government has recognised that injured veterans will sometimes need a lifetime of care , and this should extend to protecting their war pensions			1
' a @entity195 spokesman said : ' we follow @entity188 guidance when assessing people who receive war pensions and need social care			0
this includes the ability to exercise discretion based on individual circumstances			0
' while we can not comment in detail on mr @entity5 's circumstances , following representation by his family the council has exercised significant discretion in his case , with effect from january 2014			1
' the claim that he is left with just £ 10 a week from his war pension is incorrect			1
' a government spokesman said : ' as part of the @entity220 , this government has committed to ensuring veterans get special treatment and are not disadvantaged by their service			0
we have been working with the @entity27 to see how we can support all veterans			0
' @entity195 employs 21 senior managers earning more than £ 100,000 but does not cover the care costs of injured veterans like @entity5			1
@entity233 , below right , the council 's head of adult social care , the department raiding mr @entity5 's war pension , earns £ 178,166 - a - year plus expenses			1
the highest paid member of staff is @entity237 , corporate director of strategic and corporate services , who is paid £ 189,575 by the taxpayer			0
the council was heavily criticised when its former chief executive @entity241 , below left , walked away with the £ 420,000 pay - off after just 20 months in charge			0
she left after axing 1,000 jobs at a cost of almost £ 11million			0
the council 's accounts revealed she had received a final year package of £ 589,165 , including a £ 420,000 pay - off , £ 139,806 in salary and a £ 29,359 pension contribution			2
within months she was made the @entity254 's director - general for civil service reform on a salary of £ 142,000 a year – just £ 500 less than the prime minister .			0

@entity5 , says it ' stinks ' that £ 95 of his £ 105 weekly pension is taken
aged 19 he stormed @entity13 but was shot in the leg by the enemy
he lay for two days surrounded by his dead platoon until he was rescued
after his *recovery* he served in @entity269 before working in the docks until 1990
mr @entity5 moved to his care home so he was ' not a burden ' on family
but *decision* means that his local council pays for care from war pension
government only offers free care to those injured in service after 2005
