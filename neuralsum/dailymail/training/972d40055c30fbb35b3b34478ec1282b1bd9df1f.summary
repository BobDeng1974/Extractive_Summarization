the secret to happiness could lie in something as simple as a tuna sandwich or cod and chips			0
eating fish can keep the blues at bay , according to a new study - but only in women the paper – published in the @entity31 – speculates that high levels of omega - 3 fatty acids may combine with the female sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone to keep the brain functioning properly			1
a team from the @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity41 , tracked more than 1,400 men and women aged between 26 and 36 for a period of five years			0
the participants kept diaries of their diet – including various types of seafood including fish , prawns and mussels - while details about their mental health were also collated			1
even after taking into account lifestyle factors such as smoking , weight , exercise , alcohol consumption , education and employment status , a strong link was found between eating fish and incidence of depression			2
the study states : ‘ for women , there was a trend for each additional weekly serving of fish to reduce the risk of having depression during follow - up by six per cent			1
‘ women who ate fish more than two times per week at baseline had a 25 per cent lower risk of having depression during follow - up than those who ate fish less than two times per week			1
‘ for men , baseline fish consumption was not associated with the risk of depression			2
’ it adds : ‘ the observed protective association for women but not for men may have been due to men consuming more omega - 3 fatty acids from other dietary sources , particularly from meat			1
researchers discovered that having seafood on the menu at least twice a week reduces the risk of depression among females by 25 per cent ‘ alternatively , interactions between sex hormones and omega - 3 fatty acids might provide another explanation			1
‘ these findings add to the growing evidence that fish consumption may be beneficial for women ’s mental health			0
’ dr @entity105 , chief executive of the @entity106 , said : “ part of the brain is formed from omega 3 long chain fatty acids commonly found in oily fish			1
‘ there have been other studies that indicate that eating oily fish might have an impact on mood			0
‘ this study has reached an interesting conclusion that the benefits are seen purely in women , however , it remains unclear what factors are at play here and further research would be necessary to confirm this result			0
‘ what is beyond argument , though , is that the human body , including the brain , requires appropriate nutrition to function properly and that , in some instances , deficiencies can and do manifest themselves in conditions such as depression			2
‘ consumption of oily fish can promote good health in many ways as part of a balanced diet			0
’ around five million @entity141 are living with depression at any one time with up to one in five people affected at some point in their lives			1
research shows women are more than twice as likely to fall victim , mostly between the ages of 16 and 42 as they try to balance work and family life			0
rates have soared since the 1970s and depression is now recognised as a predictor of risk for diseases such as @entity158 ’s and @entity159 ’s			2
@entity161 dr @entity160 said : ‘ the fatty acids in fish are long chain so can be readily used by the body whereas they are short chain in meat so have to be adapted			1
‘ if men consume more food but are more reliant on meat for their fatty acids than women , it would perhaps explain why the positive effects of fish on depression are seen only in women in this study			1
‘ long chain fatty acids have been proven to be good for brain health			1
‘ it ’s recommended that people eat two portions of fish a week , one of them oily , such as mackerel , fresh tuna , salmon or sardines			2
‘ but shellfish and white fish are also nutrient - rich and can stop deficiencies in key minerals such as zinc and iodine			2
‘ this study shows again why people should stop looking at food simply as fuel and think more broadly			0
‘ it does n’t take much to tweak your diet and reap considerable health benefits			0
