the depraved , sadistic horror of the latest videos and photographs posted on the internet by @entity4 is almost impossible to contemplate			2
they show two men bound and blindfolded as they are manhandled to the edge of a rooftop parapet			1
their only ‘ crime ’ ? to be gay			2
a masked is fighter announces into a microphone that the two prisoners have ‘ engaged in homosexual activities ’ and must be punished in accordance with @entity17 , @entity19 law			1
in the square about 100 feet below , a large , all - male mob has gathered			1
then the grisly carnival proceeds as , one by one , the men are thrown from the roof			1
a still shows one victim in a sitting position , mid-flight			2
in another , both lie on the ground motionless , presumably dead			2
the same ‘ release ’ from @entity5 on friday shows two more victims , supposedly ‘ bandits ’ , hanging by their wrists from rough , iron crucifixes while masked gunmen , dressed in military fatigues , brandish pistols			1
the next photo reveals the puffs of gunsmoke as both men are shot through the head			1
then there is a video sequence which , if possible , is more shocking			2
a woman shrouded in a black burka is dragged across a sandy area , pulled by a white cord tied round her waist			2
her voice , punctuated by terrified , breathless gasps , can be heard pleading with her captors			2
then , in a grove of dusty trees , the fighters hurl large rocks at her			2
the final image shows her body covered by a tarpaulin			0
her supposed ‘ crime ’ is said to have been adultery			0
execution : a masked is fighter manhandles a bound and blindfolded prisoner towards the edge of the rooftop @entity5 , which controls sizeable portions of @entity78 and @entity39 , is by no means alone in its resort to execution , although few countries exact capital punishment with the same stomach - churning brutality			1
yet my new book reveals that across the world , the use of capital punishment is in retreat , with the spread of human rights standards even to countries such as @entity93			1
since 1988 , the number of countries which have abolished capital punishment has tripled from 35 to 100			1
only 39 of the world ’s 198 nations have executed anyone in the past ten years			0
there has also been a steep decline in the use of the death penalty in most countries that retain it			0
the 35 executions in the @entity106 last year were the fewest for 20 years			0
there have been steep falls in @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 , while @entity93 has introduced much stricter legal safeguards and rights of appeal			0
it is still the world ’s most frequent user , but although the total of prisoners executed remains a state secret , local experts believe it has halved in less than a decade			0
the worrying exception , however , is the @entity17 world , where many countries continue to impose the death penalty for ‘ offences ’ which in most jurisdictions would never be considered as crimes – such as homosexuality and adultery			0
sickening : the prisoner stays in the sitting position as he plummets to what can only be his death here there has been a surge in the number of executions and the continuing application of the death penalty for ‘ crimes ’ far less serious than murder or terrorism			0
in fact , some @entity17 scholars believe use of capital punishment in countries like @entity149 goes far beyond the requirements of @entity152 teaching			1
in @entity149 , and some other states where @entity19 law is embedded in the legal system , the fundamentalists are in control			1
the @entity152 says the death penalty should be reserved for the most heinous offences			0
executions in @entity161 have roughly quintupled to just under 1,000 a year since 2005 , and show no sign of diminishing , despite the election of the so - called ‘ liberal ’ @entity164 as president			1
here the death penalty is imposed for crimes including embezzlement , burglary and robbery , as well as religious ‘ crimes ’ such as adultery			0
grisly : two @entity4 fighters lead the second prisoner to the rooftop edge homosexuality is a capital crime in @entity17 countries including @entity161 , @entity178 , @entity149 , and @entity179			1
capital punishment can be applied for adultery in @entity182 , @entity161 , @entity178 , @entity183 , @entity149 , @entity179 and the @entity184			1
as an abolitionist , i find it depressing that while @entity190 soldiers died in part to defend human rights in @entity39 and @entity182 , both countries have seen big increases in the use of the death penalty			1
in @entity39 , capital punishment was abolished in 2003 , but reintroduced two years later			1
it now covers not only murder but crimes such as the theft of electricity			0
@entity39 executes about 150 people a year			1
by the end of 2013 , there were 300 prisoners on death row in @entity182 , many convicted only on the evidence of confessions obtained under torture			0
there have been executions for ‘ immoral behaviours ’ such as infidelity , and of children			0
horror : the two prisoners lie motionless on the ground , both men presumed dead even @entity17 countries where executions had wholly or largely ceased are now seeing a new surge			1
following the terrorist attack on the school in @entity222 last year , @entity183 has carried out its first for eight years			0
and last week , @entity223 announced it intended to execute the 64 people on its death row for drug crimes as soon as possible , and issued six immediate death warrants			0
the theatrical is atrocities are monstrous , yet of course there is a context – and that is the handful of regimes where the brutal application of capital punishment is the norm , not the exception			2
it is all too easy for western governments to condemn is while still maintaining relationships with countries such as @entity149 , @entity178 and increasingly @entity161			0
it is not consistent – and if we are serious about human rights it must be addressed .			0
