@entity0 , an entertainment site which used photos of a former anorexic 's recovery from her @entity5 page without her permission , claiming they were an example of an ' amazing weight loss transformation ' , has issued her a public apology			1
' we obviously had no idea @entity14 had anorexia , but that does n’t excuse the action at all			2
it was a mistake , completely unintentional , ' the website stated , having left @entity19 , 27 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , ' sickened ' to see her photos used , in her words , ' as inspiration for a disorder that nearly killed me '			1
the @entity27 added : ' we had previously discovered the photo somewhere out there in the internet echo chamber , which contained no frame of reference whatsoever ... the photo was removed the second we found out about it			1
' wrong message : the chive has apologized for using photos @entity19 , 27 , had posted of herself before anorexia struck ( left ) and at her sickest ( right ) for an ' amazing weight loss ' slideshow the @entity27 used two photos @entity14 had uploaded to @entity5 , under the thread : ' my recovery from an eating disorder , updated ' - and added them to a slideshow featuring 27 other similar snaps under the heading : ' these weight loss transformations are amazing			1
' the photo @entity14 posted to her @entity5 thread of herself dangerously thin at 90lbs was used as the ' after ' snap in @entity0 's weight loss slideshow , and the photo she posted of herself prior to her developing anorexia was used as the ' before ' snap			1
as part of its apology , @entity0 made sure to bring light to the intended nature of @entity14 's photos			1
' a few days ago , @entity14 took the time to put together an inspirational gallery about how she overcame the disorder , even after relapsing , ' it reads			2
' there is an amazing positive in all this and we ’re proud to share her story with the @entity70 and we hope it helps others who might be suffering from the disorder			0
' apology : ' we obviously had no idea @entity14 had anorexia , but that does n’t excuse the action at all , ' the website wrote as part of the above statement doing better : ' for them to put my disordered weight as " ideal " was a punch to the stomach for me , ' said @entity14 yesterday , pictured during her recovery , after posting the photos to @entity5 to chart her progress speaking to @entity88 about the publication 's response , @entity14 said : ' i am so pleased that they apologized and featured my story			1
' i have no bad blood with them anymore and so happy that they owned up to the mistake ! it takes a very strong person to admit when they are wrong , and even stronger when they admit it to a very popular site			0
' yesterday , after @entity104 was originally sent @entity0 's article by a concerned @entity5 member , and prior to its apology , she told @entity88 : ' for them to put my disordered weight as " ideal " was a punch to the stomach for me			1
' this disease left me bankrupt and almost killed me			0
i posted my photos to give hope to others who may have body image issues			2
the least i could get from the chive is an apology			0
' @entity116 took the best years of my life			0
to wake up to that image [ on the chive ] - i can not even begin to explain			0
' yesterday , we posted a 28 - photo gallery called these transformations are amazing on @entity0			1
one of the photos depicted a girl named @entity14 in a dress who had lost weight , the photo had no text accompaniment whatsoever			1
as it turns out @entity14 used to suffer from anorexia			2
we had previously discovered the photo somewhere out there in the internet echo chamber which contained no frame of reference whatsoever			0
we obviously had no idea @entity14 had anorexia but that does n’t excuse the action at all			2
it was a mistake , completely unintentional , and the photo was removed the second we found out about it			2
we usually do n’t air these issues out in public , because i think the true apology belongs to @entity14 personally , which we have also sent			2
we are deeply sorry for having posted this photo , but i ’m posting this out here on @entity0 because i think you should know about @entity14 ’s story			1
a few days ago , @entity14 took the time to put together an inspirational gallery about how she overcame the disorder , even after relapsing			0

deleted : the @entity27 removed @entity14 's snaps from their slideshow ( pictured ) ' the second ' it realized its mistake as it appeared : the @entity27 's post , was titled , ' these weight loss transformations are amazing ' and featured 27 other people 's ' before and after ' snaps ( pictured ) , the origin of which are unknown @entity14 weighed 150lbs in 2006 , just before her disorder started to develop			1
a ' crash diet ' sent her down a ' dark ' path , however , and by 2007 , she weighed just 70lbs - having lost more than half of her body weight			0
' my dad died , and other c * * p snowballed my weight loss into some monster of a thing , ' she wrote on @entity5 , explaining her worsening mental health			1
' it started out innocently enough , but became a five - hour - a - day workout and 500 calories a day			0
' @entity14 then shared photos of her recovery , as well as several relapses , and reveals that she was finally sent to a treatment center after a suicide attempt in 2013			1
her progress since then has been up and down , and her treatment currently means she ca n't work , and is in $ 50,000 of medical debt			0
road to recovery : @entity14 , pictured ( left ) during a relapse and ( right ) at a healthier weight , says her disorder almost killed her , and left her $ 50,000 in debt over medical expenses @entity14 finds it extremely frustrating that she ca n't work , so this year , she started shoveling snow from sidewalks and driveways in her neighborhood - an act which earned her a spot on a @entity208 segment			1
' i feel really bad taking taxpayers ' money , ' she says			0
' i know i really need it to keep a roof over my head , but it does n't make me feel any better about taking it			0
' doing things like shoveling my town makes me feel like i earned the money i have taken from my neighbors			0
' @entity14 has launched a @entity222 campaign to help raise funds to pay off her medical bills , which has so far gained $ 865 in donations .			0

the @entity27 added photos it had found of @entity229 , 27 , from @entity230 , @entity21 , to an ' amazing weight loss transformation ' slideshow
upon realizing @entity14 was a former anorexic who had posted the snaps to @entity5 to chart her recovery , it removed them and apologized
@entity14 , who was ' sickened ' when she saw her photos had been *misused* , told @entity88 that she has accepted @entity0 's apology
