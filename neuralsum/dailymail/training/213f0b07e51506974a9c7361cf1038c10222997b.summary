by @entity0 they have been the sites of bitter battles and inspired one of @entity5 ’s most famous poets , and now some of @entity8 ’ regal castles have been captured by drone			1
aerial perspectives show off the ruined castles ' striking features and interesting layouts , which were built for battles and were then adapted over the centuries - sometimes for parties			1
the @entity8 government used the unmanned crafts to show off the country ’s history from a unique perspective			1
they are all examples of medieval fortifications and feature elaborate defences , such as @entity33 ’s network of moats and lakes to keep warring factions outside of its walls			1
@entity33 's lakes have been described as ‘ the most elaborate water defences in all of @entity5 ’			2
an inspiration : @entity32 use to visit @entity31 ( pictured ) to pen poems when he had writer 's block and his granddaughter said it was the view from there that ' would have inspired him most ' @entity55 was built more with entertainment in mind as its great hall was designed by @entity59 to be the perfect backdrop for banquets			1
and while millions of people visit the sites every year , very few will have been able to see the magnificent castles from above			2
that is why @entity67 , the @entity69 ’s historic environment service , took to the skies using drones to make the high resolution videos			1
a historical spy : the @entity8 government used drones ( like the one pictured ) to show off the country 's history from a unique perspective @entity55 ( pictured ) conveys the affluence and power of the medieval church when religion was the order of the day ' we ’re always looking at new and exciting ways to bring @entity8 ’s history to life and these videos are a good way of showcasing our incredible heritage sites from a different angle , ’ said @entity93 , minister for culture and @entity94			1
‘ more than two and a half million people visit @entity67 sites every year but few people will ever have had the opportunity to see them like this			2
‘ @entity8 ’s historic environment gives character to our communities and strengthens a sense of belonging and identity , and we hope that these innovative videos will inspire people to explore their local heritage sites this summer			1
’ the @entity8 government used the unmanned crafts to record the four castles , shown on the map @entity31 : the medieval castle turned @entity112 mansion was built in the 13th century			1
its grounds provided inspiration to both @entity32 and @entity116 who put pen to paper in the castle ’s garden summerhouse			1

@entity128 : the earliest castle on this site was @entity131 and built around 1115 ad it was rebuilt in stone in the 13th century			0
the aerial video shows how @entity135 benefited from the latest thinking in castle design			2

@entity55 : the palace conveys the affluence and power of the medieval church when religion was the order of the day			0
