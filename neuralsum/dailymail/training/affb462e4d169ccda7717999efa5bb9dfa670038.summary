by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ marthakelner @entity2 became the oldest @entity4 champion in history on tuesday night , just one month shy of her 41st birthday and less than a year after giving birth to her second baby			1
@entity2 cradled 11 - month - old daughter @entity10 as she did a sprightly lap of honour at the @entity13 after winning 10,000m gold just 10 days after taking a bronze medal in the 5,000m at the @entity16			1
demonstrating remarkable powers of recovery , @entity2 went ahead with one lap to go and accelerated down the home straight , resisting the challenge of silver medallist @entity22 of @entity24 , who is 16 years her junior			1
champion : @entity2 crosses the line to win her first career title at the age of 40 it is a first major title for @entity2 , who replaces @entity31 ’s @entity30 as the oldest gold medallist in the 80 - year history of these championships			1
@entity30 won the 4x100m relay title in 2006 aged 40 years and 27 days			1
@entity2 said of her new record : ‘ that ’s a really nice statistic to have			1
it is quite an honour			2
’ the @entity40 painted an unconventional but touching picture of family training sessions , with her husband and coach , @entity45 , instructing drills with @entity10 strapped to his chest in a baby carrier , while four - year - old son @entity49 mimics his mother by running down the long jump runway			1
‘ we decided to bring them both along ( to @entity54 ) , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ it made me really emotional to have her watch it , its the first time she ’s seen me run in a major championships			2
my little boy , too , of course			0
i ca n’t believe it , i really enjoyed it but i ’m really surprised			0
’ a model of consistency , @entity2 has never finished lower than fifth in her three previous @entity67			1
she won silver in @entity69 two years ago behind @entity71 ’s @entity70 and on paper was the fifth fastest athlete this year on the start line			2
final push : @entity2 hangs on the shoulders of the leaders before making her move late on to take gold she made things difficult for herself , running wide in lane two for much of the race			2
after hovering in eighth place in the middle of the leading pack , she moved into third with two laps to go before taking the lead on the 25th and final lap. @entity89 looked assured 80 metres from the line			2
she appeared overwhelmed , looking at the clock before raising her tired arms in a deliriously happy daze			0
‘ i bet people are criticising me for running wide so much , ’ she said			0
‘ but every time i tried to tuck in i got spiked			0
i got a bit worried about it , thinking , “ this feels a really long way , maybe i should have just done the 5k ” but then i thought maybe everyone else was thinking it ’s a long way too ! ‘ i tried to do a controlled last lap because i did n’t want to blow up on the home straight , then i did n’t know how close the other girls were , so i thought , “ just give it all you ’ve got and you ca n’t regret anything ”			0
’ it was a poignant moment for @entity2 , a prodigious junior athlete who set a @entity112 under 15 record for the 1500m in 1988 but spent most of the following decade blighted by injury			1
making it hard : @entity2 ran most of the race on the outside of lane two before taking a final - lap lead celebration : the athlete celebrates her second medal at a major championship in just 10 days she added : ‘ it ’s quite funny really , to try for so many years and now do it when i ’m 40			1
’ the @entity127 team will expect to add more medals on wednesday when @entity129 is favourite to emulate @entity2 ’s success in the men ’s 10,000m			2
the 100m trio of @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 thrived on the speedy @entity138 track			0
all won their heats with @entity141 , the second fastest @entity4 in history behind @entity143 , the slowest of the three but the most comfortable			0
the 26 - year - old has struggled with a hamstring injury since running 9.91sec last year but he claims to be in better shape than ever			1
‘ i was n’t really pushing myself , ’ said @entity135			0
‘ i ’m expecting a medal , hopefully			0
’ hopeful : @entity127 will expect more medals in the coming days with @entity135 and @entity129 in contention @entity134 , competing in his sixth @entity4 championships at 36 , also eased up in 10.18sec and admitted he was in a race against time to win another medal			2
‘ the door is closing on me , ’ he said			0
‘ i want to hear the national anthem again			0
’ @entity157 , who originally planned 2014 as a year off from athletics , set a season ’s best of 51.42sec to win her heat and qualify second fastest for this evening ’s 400m semi-final			0
the reigning world champion was contesting only her third race of the year and eased up with 70m to run			0
