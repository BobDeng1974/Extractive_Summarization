the world ’s biggest accountancy firm @entity0 , powerfulbanks @entity2 and @entity3 , and giant law firm @entity4 , now part of @entity4 – which represented @entity6 at the @entity7 – are all on a secret list belonging to a corrupt private detective			1
a mail on sunday investigation has also established the rogue investigators jailed last year for illegally accessing information by ‘ blagging ’ appeared to be linked to international solicitors ’ firms @entity15 – which represented former @entity18 boss @entity17 – and @entity19 last night a senior @entity21 source indicated that all six firms are on the classified @entity24 list currently locked away in a safe opposite @entity25			1
‘ @entity28 ’ is defined as obtaining information without consent			2
but @entity29 has also uncovered new @entity24 evidence often further blue - chip firms – whose names were recorded by one of the detectives – including @entity39 sponsor and insurance giant @entity40 , and @entity41 , a @entity32 bank			1
the evidence we have seen shows that @entity24 were aware of the names of the companies five years ago			2
@entity46 have demanded that the companies ’ names are made public			0
there is no evidence that those named knowingly employed the rogue detectives in criminal activity on their behalf			0
it is unclear whether the other names also appear on the list passed to mps			0
we can also reveal that @entity60 , a construction company with multi-million - pound government contracts and @entity62 , a bespoke security firm specialising in work for celebrities , were both linked to the detectives in cases which resulted in prosecutions			1
the list came to light two months ago			0
@entity24 handed the secret list of 102 over to mps on the @entity72 our revelations last night led to calls for the second stage of the @entity7 to be widened beyond the media so that it includes the use of private eyes to perform illegal acts by any clients			1
the controversial @entity24 list of 102 customers was handed over amid great secrecy to mps on the @entity72 last month			1
the existence of the clandestine list emerged two months ago			0
since then there have been repeated calls for the agency dubbed ‘ @entity93 ’s @entity92 ’ to name the companies			2
but @entity24 ’s former chairman sir @entity94 – who resigned over a conflict of interest last month – prevented publication of the names as it could ‘ substantially undermine the financial viability of major organisations by tainting them with public association with criminality ’			1
last week @entity103 , @entity24 director general , said : ‘ i repeat the point we are not alleging that the individuals or companies named on the list have or even may have committed a criminal offence			1
’ today this newspaper is listing the names of companies and individuals who are linked to the convicted detectives			2
our enquiries into the @entity24 files revealed : there is no evidence that the company was aware of the illegal activity			2
@entity24 ’s investigation into private eyes , called @entity124 , began in 2008 when infamous blagger @entity125 , 34 – already under surveillance – advertised an @entity129 computer for sale from his home in @entity132			1
undercover officers bought the computer for £ 590 and , after forensic examination , retrieved a number of files which @entity125 had sought to destroy			0
this led police to four other private investigators , three of whom , along with @entity125 , were convicted of fraud for their part in the blagging of information on a number of victims in 2007 and 2008			1
when arrested in may 2009 , @entity125 told officers : ‘ i know why you are here , this is massive			1
i ’m in the biggest s * * t imaginable			0
‘ do you want me to talk now ? i ’ll sing like a canary			0
’ @entity125 , described as the ‘ lynchpin ’ along with former policeman @entity153 , @entity154 and one other man who can not be named for legal reasons , were all jailed at @entity157 last year			1
after the case , @entity24 tried to justify why they had only investigated the private eyes rather than any third parties by saying : ‘ in recognition of the fact the operation might also uncover information relevant to other authorities , @entity24 worked in partnership with a number of bodies including [ data protection watchdog ] the @entity171 ( @entity171 )			1
@entity24 will now hand over any such information to its partners to determine whether further action is appropriate			0
’ but the @entity171 has still not been handed the information discovered during the @entity124 investigation			2
@entity24 said they decided to make it available first to the @entity181 ’s @entity180 team , an ongoing investigation into computer hacking , primarily by journalists			2
but last week it emerged that while some evidence on the @entity187 had been passed over to the @entity189 team , it was not until three weeks ago that @entity181 commander @entity190 was handed an official list showing customers organised into business sectors			2
@entity24 ’s decision to block publication came as the newspaper industry was targeted in the phone - hacking inquiry , which led to widespread public revulsion and the largest criminal investigation in @entity93 history over practices which include the hiring of corrupt private eyes			1
in light of the revelations , there have been calls for @entity209 's hacking inquiry to look beyond the media even lawyer @entity216 , representing the family of hacked murder victim @entity212 and a scourge of the tabloids , has said : ‘ consistency demands that the same rules apply to all , whether you run a newspaper , a pharmaceutical company or a law firm			2
’ documents uncovered in our investigations suggest that in 2008 major tunnelling contractor @entity60 investigated three of its own employees suspected of taking ‘ kickbacks			1
’ some of the work was carried out by @entity230			0
as with many of the cases , there was a complicated chain of command involving companies hiring private detectives who might subcontract work to other private detectives who may not be so scrupulous in their methods			2
last year a private investigator who was arrested and later cleared in the ‘ blagging ’ case took @entity60 to an employment tribunal claiming he had been promised a job in return for keeping the company ’s name out of the inquiry			1
his case was thrown out , but during the hearing the company ’s lawyers revealed that around september 2009 the firm was ‘ advised by solicitors that it faced no charges and indeed that at no stage did it fear criminal prosecution ’			1
a spokesperson said : ‘ @entity60 takes issues of fraud and misconduct very seriously and operates a whistleblowing system through which individuals can register any concerns			0
all such investigations are conducted properly and within the confines of the law			0
’ @entity270 , now called @entity271 , is one of the companies mentioned in @entity153 ’s files			0
@entity270 specialises in handling problems and security issues for celebrities and wealthy individuals discreetly			2
founded by @entity280 veteran and @entity281 , 56 , it was formed in 1993 and boasts of clients including multinationals , finance houses and law firms			0
our files show that the company used the services of the corrupt detectives on numerous occasions , and a trail of emails prove it often directly engaged @entity125 – usually through its former financial controller , @entity295 , who died of alcohol poisoning in 2011			1
mr @entity281 failed to answer our calls or emails last week , but former operations director and @entity302 officer @entity301 , who left the firm three years ago , yesterday denied that @entity62 had engaged @entity125			0
another company linked to the case is @entity306 the large rail contractor does not appear on the @entity24 list itself , but it is closely linked to a firm which does : @entity310			1
@entity0 - the world 's biggest accountancy firm - was one of the names on the top secret list @entity315 is a specialist demolition and civil engineering contractor recently awarded a £ 46 million contract to build power infrastructure alongside the @entity320 for @entity321			1
since 2008 , @entity315 has donated £ 63,500 to the @entity322 and a further £ 20,000 to dr @entity323 mp , according to the @entity324			0
we have seen a fax sent in july 2008 , by chartered accountant @entity327 , 59 , a director of @entity310 , giving the bank account numbers of a business rival he wanted to be examined and ended with : ‘ requirement : special investigation on his personal and business bank accounts			1
’ in 2009 @entity335 went into liquidation and was taken over by @entity315 , and @entity327 became finance director at one of the group ’s companies , @entity341			0
contacted by @entity29 , @entity327 said he had never been asked about the fax by @entity24 or any other police officers , but admitted sending it			0
‘ it ’s not something i ’ve ever done before or since			0
at that time , i was n’t asking anything illegal to be done			0
i did n’t know what someone could or could n’t get through legal means , ’ he said			0
when we asked him , as a chartered accountant , whether he knew of any legal means to investigate an individual ’s personal bank account without his consent , he replied : ‘ i assumed – obviously wrongly – that it would be done by fair means , not foul means			1
i just had n’t thought it through			0
’ a spokesman for @entity315 said : ‘ we would , of course , prefer if you did not refer to @entity315 in your article , given that the events you refer to date back to 2008 when mr @entity327 was not employed by @entity315			2
he was employed by us from 2009 to 2012 , and as a director of the rail division only in the last two of these years – from 2010 until 2012			0

controversial @entity24 list that had been kept top secret was handed over to mps last month
investigation into @entity373 started in 2008 when blagger @entity125 was caught
@entity0 , @entity2 and @entity4 appear on the list of companies
a security company run by a former @entity381 officer appears to have *commissioned* corrupt detectives on hush - hush jobs for celebrities and wealthy clients .
a chartered accountant at a rail contractor asked private eyes to spy on a business rival , obtaining bank statements .
a construction company was advised by its lawyers as far back as 2009 they ‘ need not fear ’ prosecution after blaggers spied on three of their employees in a ‘ kickbacks ’ probe .
