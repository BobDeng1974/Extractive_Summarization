to an almost audible sound of thousands of hearts breaking in two , @entity0 has announced that he is off the market			1
the man widely seen as the most desired thespian in the world — despite looks that he himself compares to both an otter and @entity9 the racehorse — has made it known that he is engaged to his girlfriend , @entity12			1
in a bare , if momentous , paragraph in the @entity16 section of @entity17 , the dreaded news was delivered : ‘ mr @entity18 and miss @entity19			2
the engagement is announced between @entity0 , son of @entity21 and @entity22 of @entity23 and @entity12 , daughter of @entity25 of @entity26 and @entity27 of @entity23			1
‘ i think [ that name ] sets feminism back so many notches , ’ he once said			2
one fan offered : ‘ on one hand i ’m so happy for him and for her			2
she gets to have this wonderful man , she can wake up next to him , kiss him and see his beautiful smile every day			2
on the other hand i ’m crying my eyes out			2
’ ‘ is it normal to be so happy and yet so heartbroken ? ’ asked another			2
there was a common theme in the messages from the 172,000 followers of the ‘ @entity36 ’ @entity56 page and the 117,000 fans of his @entity59 page : surprise			2
‘ she moves fast , ’ observed one @entity63 - fan			2
@entity0 and @entity12 have known each other for five years , but have been dating for only five months @entity0 and @entity12 have known each other for five years , but have been dating for only five months — perhaps even less			1
‘ it ’s wonderful news and we are all thrilled for him , ’ said a friend of the actor			2
‘ i ’ve never known him happier , and she is a wonderful woman — very intelligent			2
‘ they have known each other a long time , but the romance is recent			2
it really only took off over the summer , maybe even late summer			0
‘ it has moved fast , but when something works , it works			0
they are very good for each other and are very much in love			0
they have mutual friends and mutual interests in the theatre			0
’ when @entity0 first met @entity12 in 2009 , he was dating actress @entity88 , whom he met at university in recent years , @entity0 has been linked to an array of beautiful women			1
when he first met @entity12 in 2009 , he was dating actress @entity88 , whom he met at university			1
they split after 12 years in 2011			1
he has also been linked to @entity96 model @entity94 , @entity98 co-star @entity97 , daughter of celebrated actor @entity99 , and actress @entity100			1
@entity0 was also rumoured to be in a relationship with socialite @entity102 , 30 , daughter of newspaper heiress @entity103 , who was kidnapped in the 1970s by left - wing urban guerilla group the @entity105			1
she is the granddaughter of newspaper magnate @entity107			0
@entity0 has been linked to an array of beautiful women including @entity96 model @entity94 @entity0 ’s last serious girlfriend before @entity12 was the fashion designer @entity110 , from whom he separated in 2012 , after a romance lasting not quite a year			1
though he has been linked to a number of women over the years , people who know @entity0 insist he has not dated even half of them			1
one said : ‘ he ’s not a “ player ” , although he does go to lots of parties and talks to lots of girls			0
’ so how did @entity12 manage to bag this most eligible — yet elusive — bachelor ? in fact , the pair met while working together on set in 2009			1
they remained friends , but their romantic relationship only took off this summer			0
the pair were first spotted watching the @entity29 tennis together in @entity131 in june			0
since then , they have been seen having dinner together in @entity23 — entering and leaving the restaurant separately			0
they also attended the wedding of one of @entity0 ’s schoolfriends in september			1
he has also previously been linked to actress @entity100 , the daughter of @entity140 's @entity139 and last month the actor was seen in @entity26 , where miss @entity12 ’s mother lives			1
the young couple were seen strolling in the unseasonal sunshine around the city ’s @entity145			0
some speculated he had gone to the city to ask mrs @entity12 for permission to make @entity12 his wife			1
however , a close friend of the star told me last night this was not the case : ‘ they just got engaged this week			2
he did n’t go up to @entity26 to ask her mum first			0
he asked her , i think , on monday , then they rang to put the advert in on tuesday			0
’ friends say @entity0 , 38 , is now trying to work out when he will be able to tie the knot — between filming @entity162 in january , attending the @entity163 in march ( he ’s a hot tip for best actor this year for his role as gay computer genius @entity167 in @entity169 ) and a three - month spell as @entity171 at the barbican next autumn			1
cue mourning from millions of adoring women around the world — the ‘ @entity36 ’ have been left distraught by the news of the actor 's impending nuptials apparently his every moment is accounted for until well into 2016 , so perhaps there will be a long engagement — although pals are saying they think he will manage to find a slot over the next 12 months			1
so , who is the woman who has won @entity162 ’s heart ? like @entity0 — who went to @entity186 on an art scholarship — she is both artistic and well - connected			1
indeed , in this she is a perfect partner for @entity0 , the son of two actors , who was raised in @entity191 , @entity23			1
although he can get cross if anyone says he is posh , his grandfather was a @entity195 submarine commander and had his wedding covered at length in @entity17			0
( meaning , rather sweetly , that this engagement announcement was part of family tradition			0
) @entity0 was also rumoured to be in a relationship with socialite @entity102 , 30 , daughter of newspaper heiress @entity103 his great - grandfather , @entity202 , was the @entity203 consul general in @entity204 , @entity205 , and received a @entity206 — an honour sometimes known as ‘ @entity208 ’ — or @entity209			1
@entity12 , meanwhile , has royal and military ties			1
her uncle is sir @entity212 , an @entity213 and @entity214 - educated member of the @entity215			2
sir @entity212 , married to @entity12 ’s aunt , @entity217 , was knighted in 1999			1
he was in the household of the @entity219 between 2006 and 2008 , and has served as an equerry to the @entity221			0
he was responsible for organising the funerals of @entity223 , @entity223 , and the @entity224 , and was put in charge of preparations for @entity228 ’s funeral			0
meanwhile , @entity12 ’s grandfather was general sir @entity230 , a high - ranking figure known for his witty portraits of @entity105 life			1
sir @entity230 , who died last year , was general officer commanding @entity235 from 1979 , and one of the first @entity203 officers to enter the @entity239 in 1945			0
@entity12 was raised by her mother , her parents having separated when she was young			1
her father , @entity242 , is a professional cards player , but started out in insurance			0
she has two brothers , @entity246 and @entity22			0
while studying modern languages at @entity248 , she began dating artist @entity249 — once named by @entity250 as one of the ‘ @entity252 ’ — the son of @entity253 , the @entity224 ’s biographer , and art critic @entity255			0
@entity12 moves , then , in very similar circles to @entity0 , whose friends include actress @entity258 and @entity260 ’s @entity259 , who plays @entity261 , and @entity262 , who famously left the show			1
@entity0 and @entity12 even have matching porcelain complexions , prominent cheekbones and @entity267 blue eyes			1
while he launched his acting career straight out of @entity270 , his fiancee reached academic heights			0
after @entity248 , she went to theatre school @entity272 in @entity131 — meaning she is fluent in @entity273			0
in 2005 , she worked with songwriter @entity274 on album @entity276 , in which she sings in @entity273			0
she is a talented pianist , too			0
@entity0 ’s last serious girlfriend before @entity12 was the fashion designer @entity110 , from whom he separated in 2012 but it is in acting and the theatre that she has made her way			1
she was awarded the prestigious @entity282 in 2007 for writing and directing a play called @entity284 at @entity285			0
she co-founded the @entity286 , and has directed plays and operas , including the 2010 revival of @entity291 ’s ghosts on @entity292			0
her highest - profile acting work was a minor role in 2004 film @entity296			2
and she and @entity0 met while acting in the obscure movie @entity298 in 2009			1
now , it seems , he is ready for marriage			0
last night , his pr , @entity302 , told me : ‘ @entity0 and @entity12 are old friends — they have worked together in the past and they just share many of the same friends			1
’ in a magazine interview last year , @entity0 said : ‘ without using words like marriage , children and family			2
put it this way , i hope i ’ve got other people to look back with me [ when i ’m older ]			0
i hope i ’m surrounded by family			0
’ it was his broadest hint yet that he was finally ready to settle down and take on the role of his life : as a bridegroom .			0
