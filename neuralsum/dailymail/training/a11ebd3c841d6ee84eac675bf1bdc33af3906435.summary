she said she was allowed to meet him alone at the @entity8 , where during the third visit he gave her champagne before having sex with her in his dressing room			1

she said : ' i was convinced i could n’t have been the only one and i felt it was my duty to report it , in case there was someone out there who dare n’t			0
someone who ’d suffered more than me			0
