by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:54 est , 23 may 2012 updated : 05:15 est , 24 may 2012 is it a bird ? is it a plane ? er , no. it ’s 42 - year - old @entity7 , plunging to earth at something like 60mph on a wing and a prayer			1
he has just jumped out of a helicopter at 2,400ft and is travelling rapidly towards us over the @entity15 countryside			1
parachute ? they are for sissies			2
mr @entity7 prefers his sail - like ‘ @entity23 ’ suit , which , everyone hopes , will allow him to steer towards a ( relatively ) soft landing on a bed of cardboard boxes			1
he admits that ’s the tricky @entity36 as we wait for him in a sunlit field in @entity39 , @entity40 , all eyes are skyward			2
standing nearby is his loyal wife @entity42 , who has spent the last couple of days helping her husband and an army of volunteers arrange a 12ft - deep layer of 18,600 boxes in a 40ft wide strip , about the length of a football pitch			1
yesterday , as he clambered into the helicopter from which he was to make his leap of faith , the ex-paratrooper and veteran film stunt expert was confident he had left nothing to chance in his campaign to become the first man to pull off this death - defying stunt			2
through binoculars , we can see him standing on the skids wearing helmet and neck brace			0
then he steps into fresh air			0
like a distant speck on a canvas of blue , he comes gradually into view			0
he looks like a cross between @entity75 and a flying squirrel , arms outstretched with the suit spreading out to his fingertips			2
to one side , a circling red kite gives him a suspicious glance			0
suddenly , we can make out his face			0
then , with the rather satisfying but seldom - heard percussion of man against cardboard , he cannonballs into the boxes at 50mph – and into the record books			1
he calls @entity42 on a walkie - talkie before emerging triumphant			2
although he had an emergency parachute ( the @entity91 insisted on it ) it would never open in time to save him once he passed a certain altitude			1
@entity94 : mr @entity7 gazes at the rectangular strip of cardboard boxes in a field way below view from the other side : mr @entity7 looks like a superhero as he is milliseconds away from flattening the cardboard cartons easy does it : this stunning image shows the split second before mr @entity7 hits the cardboard boxes to achieve his dream he 's alive ! the daredevil clambers out of his cardboard crash - pad to ecstatic cheers from onlookers thus , the critical point – no one dares call it ground - breaking – came 200ft up and 400ft from the boxes			1
‘ essentially it ’s a controlled crash , ’ he tells me rather perkily			0
‘ once i got six or seven seconds away , i was totally committed			0
’ first question : why ? ‘ why not ? ’ he replies			0
‘ ask an artist why he paints a picture or stands all day at a block of rock with a hammer and chisel			0
this is my art. ’ what does it feel like to fly ? ‘ it ’s beautiful , ’ he says dreamily ‘ it ’s a very emotional experience – so serene , so surreal			0
’ and landing ? ‘ amazing			2
’ the birdman , who flew under sponsorship from the @entity137 watch company , based in his home town of @entity28 , admits there was a risk involved but does not accept it was foolhardy , or even dangerous			1
on the brink : mr @entity7 prepares to take a leap of faith from the side of a helicopter above the @entity15 countryside do n't look down ! helmet and sunglasses in place , the stuntman focuses on the job in hand and prepares to jump precarious : mr @entity7 ( right ) sits in the front of the helicopter moments before he steps on to the rail below ahead of his jump on target : the adrenaline junkie is directed towards his landing zone of boxes by a giant ' go gary ' sign and an arrow he has , after all , come close to death in a jump from the @entity166 , ridden a bicycle over @entity168 and parachuted from the top of the @entity170			1
he once leaped from @entity171 into a moving boat , and plunged off a cliff after setting himself ablaze			0
@entity174 ? ‘ he is planning to become a human firework , ’ @entity42 casually discloses			0
final question : does anyone need £ 22,000 worth of slightly used cardboard boxes ? coming in to land : the daredevil prepares to crash into the middle of the mountain of cardboard boxes pretty fly : the wingman hones in on his target as bystanders hold their breath soft landing : mr @entity7 prepares for the impact into the cardboard boxes to become the first person in the world to complete a jump without the aid of a chute stunt : @entity7 takes off from a field in his home town of @entity28 today			1
moments later he jumped out at 2,400ft and landed on the thousands of cardboard boxes set up to break his fall free - falling : mr @entity7 ' flew ' in a specially - designed wing suit for nearly a mile moment of truth : mr @entity7 and his wingman @entity203 leap from the helicopter ( left ) mr @entity203 accompanied mr @entity7 for most of the way down before deploying his parachute			1
right , mr @entity7 celebrates his remarkable jump with his wife @entity42 you 'll believe a man can fly : mr @entity7 ( right ) and fellow stuntman @entity203 pose in their specially - designed wing suits ahead of the stunt yesterday touchdown : high winds during a practice run yesterday saw mr @entity7 land in a hedge family man : mr @entity7 and his wife @entity42 with their children @entity223 ( left ) and @entity224 ( right ) landmark : mr @entity7 's stunt marked the first time anyone has jumped from such a height without deploying a parachute and lived @entity230 : rcuinto			1

@entity26 @entity7 ' flew ' in a specially - designed wing suit for nearly a mile before landing on a pile of cardboard boxes
father - of - two made his *terrifying* skydive above @entity28 - @entity28
it marked the first time anyone has jumped from such a height without deploying a parachute and lived
