more than a third of @entity5 have not exercised or played sport in the past year , although 38 per cent would like to be more active ( file picture ) @entity104 , senior leisure analyst at @entity23 , said : ' not feeling fit enough to play with others could be one expression of a more general lack of physical confidence that stems from unfamiliarity with sport more widely			1
' he added it was significant this attitude was most common among older people , who are least likely to take part in sport either individually or with others			0
' however , the fact that it is also more common among people who play sport with other family members suggests promoting this type of play could be a useful means of breaking down these wider barriers			0
