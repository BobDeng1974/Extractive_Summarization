by @entity0 the partner of a woman who was stabbed to death alongside her two - year - old son yesterday condemned a serious case review which concluded that the tragedy could not have ‘ reasonably predicted ’			1
@entity7 was pregnant with @entity9 ’s child when she was knifed to death with 23 - month - old son @entity11 in full view of a neighbour at her home			1
in october , an inquest jury ruled the deaths were ‘ more than minimally contributed to by a [ police ] failure to impress upon ’ miss slack the conclusion of a police risk assessment which placed the victims at high risk of death or serious injury at the hands of @entity11 ’s unstable father , @entity27			1
tragedy : @entity7 and her son @entity11 were murdered by his father who made repeated threats to kill her - but experts said today her death could not have been predicted anger : pictured on @entity36 's @entity35 , @entity9 said the report had not gone far enough but the serious case review by @entity39 ( @entity39 ) makes no mention of the inquest jury ’s findings and concludes that the tragedy could not have been foreseen with information known at the time			1
@entity46 , 44 , a former golf tutor , killed the pair at @entity50 ’s cottage in @entity51 , @entity52 , in june 2010 , after she had told him she was having a baby with mr @entity9 - the childhood sweetheart she had resumed contact with via @entity55			1
killer : @entity27 told @entity7 he would attack her , and was even arrested , only to be released and hack her to death after the killings @entity46 , originally from @entity59 , took his own life and was found slumped over the other bodies			1
@entity46 had been arrested for threatening to kill ex-lover @entity50 , 38 , less than a week before the bloodbath			2
but while police called the human resources manager the next day to advise her that a decision had been taken to bail @entity46 while inquiries continued - officers failed to impress upon her the conclusions of a risk assessment they had conducted on @entity46 while he was being held			2
@entity72 then compounded their blunder that evening when @entity46 ’ neighbour reported that he was considering abducting @entity11			2
an officer was despatched to carry out a ‘ safe and well ’ check on @entity46 , but despite initially discovering the golf tutor ’s home empty , merely telephoned miss @entity7 to check she was ok			1
yesterday mr @entity9 , 42 , a joinery company boss , was backed by @entity50 ’s family and a domestic abuse charity in criticising the @entity82 ’s findings			2
‘ i do n’t agree with it at all ’ , he said			0
‘ there was so much information that was scattered over so many professional agencies , ( yet ) they could n’t put it all together to make a professional judgement call , that could have made a difference to @entity7 and @entity11 ’s life			1
new partner : @entity9 says @entity7 and @entity11 were failed and ' could have been alive today ' but police ignored the threats to kill in danger : @entity95 was bailed with conditions not to contact @entity50 or @entity11 and an assessment placed @entity7 at a ' high risk of homicide ' ‘ @entity72 should be damned for not telling her she was at risk of homicide			1
these things ca n’t just fall to the wayside			0
‘ the ( agencies ) just did n’t share the information with us or one another			0
the left hand did n’t know what the right was doing			0
’ miss @entity7 ’s family said they would write to the chair of the @entity114 to express their concerns			1
her mother and brother , @entity118 and @entity117 , said in a statement : ‘ we can not understand why the @entity120 omitted from its description of the inquest jury ’s verdict the finding that failings by the police contributed to the unlawful killing of @entity11			2
‘ it makes us wonder whether the authorities who were party to this report , including @entity52 police , are serious about improving the service they give to women and children facing domestic violence			0
’ @entity46 had been receiving treatment for depression with @entity139 for over two years before the tragedy and had come into contact with police on a number of occasions			0
he was detained by police under the @entity145 on may 26 , 2010 - a week before the killings - after miss @entity7 could not get him to leave her car			1
he was assessed by mental health workers and released after he was found to have no major mental illness			0
new life : @entity46 began threatening @entity7 when she told him she was expecting another child with her new partner @entity9 signs : @entity46 had been known to the authorities since 1999 after he attempted suicide the following day @entity46 was arrested after warning miss @entity7 : ‘ you ’ve no idea what i ’m capable of			1
i ’ll kill you and take him with me			0
’ the 76 page @entity82 , published yesterday , said @entity72 received about 150 to 160 reports of threats to kill each year			0
this was the only one where the threat was ‘ followed by enactment ’ in the last three years			0
the report criticised the way agencies shared information about @entity46 and said they focussed on his needs rather than the those of the mother and child , and failed to consider adequately the danger he could have posed to them			0
so far no one involved has lost their job or been disciplined over the deaths			0
the independent chair of the @entity187 , @entity188 , said the report highlighted the importance of ‘ making sure agencies understand that they must think about the entire family ’ , regardless of ‘ the person they ’re working with primarily ’			0
@entity195 , chief executive of the @entity197 national domestic violence charity , said she was concerned that the report had described incidents of murder or suicide involving a family with a child as ‘ incredibly rare ’ , when ‘ two women each week are killed in @entity205 and @entity206 by current or former partners			2

@entity27 twice threatened the life of @entity7 , report says
he killed himself after stabbing her and their son @entity11 *48* times
golf tutor , 44 , was arrested but later released a week before murders
police placed miss @entity7 at ' high risk of homicide ' - but did not tell her
@entity120 says murders could not be ' reasonably predicted '
but her partner @entity9 said : ' [ they ] could have made a difference '
