' @entity21 is a very compassionate nurse who normally provides great care to babies on the unit			0
' i do not know what went wrong that day			0
but you can not say that @entity21 is entirely responsible			0
' as the senior nurse , @entity1 should have ensured that the hospital 's procedure was adhered to and that instruction was given to the junior nurse			1
' a controlled drug error had taken place and @entity1 should take some responsibility			2
' despite being the senior nurse on duty at the time of the deaths , ms @entity1 was back on duty two days later on november 2nd , before an investigation had began while miss @entity21 remained suspended			1

it is well known doctors do not get involved in administrating drugs as this is done by nursing staff			0
' mrs @entity1 should have ensured that this policy was complied with			2
the junior doctor had very limited experience and should not have been involved in administering the drugs			0
' mrs @entity1 would have been well aware of this			2

' @entity1 is also accused of not keeping adequate records by scribbling out her signature on the morphine prescription charts without explanation , the court heard			1
miss @entity122 added : ' she scribbled out her signature on the chart but never explained why she did this			0
' @entity148 - the law firm representing the twins ’ parents - said last may that @entity152 coroner @entity151 had described the babies ’ treatment after birth as ' suboptimal ' , adding that ' there were failings in the care the twins received '			0
