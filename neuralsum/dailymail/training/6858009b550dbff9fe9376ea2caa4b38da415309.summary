@entity20 , @entity9 director of enforcement and financial crime , said : ' @entity4 ’s systems and controls were seriously defective			1
' she said : ' as a result , @entity0 , a relatively junior trader , was allowed to take vast and risky market positions , and @entity4 failed to manage the risks around that properly			1
' we know from past experience that failures to manage risk properly can cause firms to fail and cause systemic harm			0
' @entity4 became aware that unauthorised trading had taken place on the @entity37 in @entity14 on september 14 last year			2

@entity54 told jurors that he was ' a gamble or two away from destroying @entity5 's largest bank for his own gain '			1
the £ 1.4billion loss he caused - revealed when @entity0 sent a bombshell email to colleagues - wiped around 10 % - £ 2.8billion - off @entity4 's share price			1
the @entity9 , in an investigation with the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) , uncovered several ' particularly serious ' failings which put wider market confidence at risk and allowed @entity0 to commit financial crime			1

regulators said @entity4 's computerised system had ' significant deficiencies ' - allowing @entity0 's excessive trades inadequate front office supervision was discovered including poorly executed and ineffective supervision arrangements within the @entity82 division			1
@entity0 was at one point on the verge of causing losses of $ 12billion ( £ 7.5billion ) , and the hole he eventually left was the largest trading loss ever in @entity89 banking history			2

@entity101 , a partner specialising in areas of business crime and regulation at @entity105 , said : ' this case illustrates that @entity0 , while " rogue " , could not have achieved what he did without there being significant failings within the overall trading operations and @entity4 clearly accepts a degree of corporate culpability for this			1
' this case continues to underline the need for all financial institutions to have in place , and to continually monitor , highly comprehensive control systems which effectively balance the conflicting needs between regulatory compliance and corporate profit			0
' after being educated at the £ 26,000 - a - year @entity121 in @entity122 , @entity0 toyed with becoming a chemical engineer			0
but he accepted an offer from the @entity125 to study a degree in e-commerce and digital business			0

he has been jailed for seven years the banker used his salary to fund the freewheeling lifestyle typical of a brash @entity7 trader , holding raucous parties at his £ 1,000 - a - week loft apartment			1
but it was there that his ‘ naked gambling ’ ran out of control			0
he wiped £ 2.8billion off the bank ’s share price and threatened the jobs of many of his colleagues as the @entity7 struggled to recover from the recession			0
a police officer who investigated the fraud said @entity0 ’s actions were ‘ felt in financial centres around the world ’			0
his losses would have been enough to pay a year ’s salary for 70,000 nurses or build six hospitals			0
they also dwarf the £ 827million lost by rogue trader @entity172 , who brought down @entity173 in the early 1990s .			0
