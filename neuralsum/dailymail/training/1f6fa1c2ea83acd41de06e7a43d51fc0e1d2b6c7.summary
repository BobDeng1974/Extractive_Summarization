by @entity0 from flying transport planes to preparing torpedoes , life for women on the @entity3 during @entity4 was n't all about cooking with coupons and dealing with the effects of relentless @entity10 bombing raids			1
while many did join the @entity13 [ @entity13 ] and work on the land , others became an integral part of the armed forces as these incredible snapshots from the 1940 's demonstrate			0
others joined @entity19 's secret services , including those who worked on the world 's first electronic programmable computer , @entity23 , at @entity24 , where they also contributed to cracking the @entity26 and enigma codes - one of @entity19 intelligence 's greatest wartime triumphs			2
brave : women in the @entity32 ( @entity33 ) including this radio mechanic , flew test missions in planes such as the @entity38 dive bomber ( behind ) essential : trainee pilot @entity40 , pictured in her @entity42 training plane at @entity43 , later joined the @entity44 jobs for the girls : other naval roles available to women included working as transport drivers , although as this image shows , that included doing repairs deadly : @entity32 based at the enormous @entity19 naval base at @entity54 move a torpedo towards a loading bay used by one of the @entity33 's @entity59 submarines hard at work : @entity61 , an officer of the @entity63 's @entity62 , was based at @entity64 in @entity65 during the war years camaraderie : @entity61 ( centre ) , pictured with fellow pilots of the @entity63 's @entity69 in 1940 but while the role of @entity19 's female code - breakers was shrouded in secrecy at the time , those who joined the @entity32 , or @entity32 , were celebrated for their bravery			1
among the jobs performed by women were ferrying munitions and men to @entity33 ships at @entity54 and @entity80 [ @entity81 ] , providing mechanical back - up and even testing planes and equipment , including the @entity85 - an early carrier - borne dive bomber used by @entity19 forces			2
others took roles as armourers , loading torpedos and other munitions into @entity33 submarines , as engineers and as ferry pilots in the @entity96 's @entity63			0
away from the armed forces , women became @entity99 [ @entity99 ] spotters - an incredibly dangerous job that involved scanning the sky for hours on end in search of enemy planes - and even manned anti-aircraft guns such as the @entity106 40mm or @entity107			1
but @entity19 women were n't the only ones to play their part in the @entity112 victory of 1945			1
the @entity113 too had women 's army and navy units , most notably the @entity117 or waves programme			0
leading the line : a @entity32 officer examines her rifle while training to become an armourer at a @entity125 @entity124 in 1940 trainee pilot : @entity127 , a recent recruit to the women 's @entity128 , writes up a report during training at @entity43 dangerous work : @entity99 spotters scan the skies for any sign of hostile aircraft at a @entity137 anti-aircraft battery , equipped with a range finder a pair of spotters using a @entity140 - an instrument which records the bursts of anti-aircraft shells - to check the accuracy of firing at an @entity144 at @entity145 duty : an @entity99 spotter scans the skies with binoculars at an anti-aircraft command post in december 1942 with a 3.7 inch anti-aircraft gun in the background @entity154 's army : a sergeant drilling civilian members of the @entity157 , in the use of rifles during the @entity160 in 1940 action stations : members of the @entity163 are put through their paces during a training course in the early years of the war working on the land : a pair of @entity42 girls sporting straw hats return from the fields accompanied by their @entity173 horse in september 1939 @entity175 cutter : @entity177 of @entity176 at work in a timber camp in @entity180 as part of the war effort in 1942 backbreaking : a group of @entity184 shovel sugarbeet in the @entity187 beet fields in october 1940 top secret : women work on the @entity23 at @entity24 in @entity190 , which was used to help crack the @entity191 and enigma codes women in the waves really did face the same dangers as male colleagues as the haunting photo of five @entity113 @entity199 officers , including colonel @entity200 , sitting with fellow survivors onboard a rescue destroyer after their transport ship was torpedoed off the @entity205 coast in february 1943			1
others joined the women 's @entity207 or @entity199 , and spent the war years working as @entity44 ferrying new planes and other supplies to @entity113 airforce bases all over the @entity113			2
back in @entity216 , stars of the era such as @entity10 - born @entity215 did their bit by touring armed forces bases to help boost the morale of troops , while more prosaically , @entity184 spent the war years providing food for the @entity19 population as well as timber , coal and other essential supplies			0
among them was @entity177 , who spent the war years working with the @entity176 in @entity180			0
others , such as the pair of @entity184 photographed carrying straw hats through the fields , did their duty by helping to grow beetroot in @entity187			0
but whether pilot , @entity184 , timber cutter or munitions worker , what these photos make clear is that without the efforts of these brave @entity19 and @entity113 women , defeating @entity241 could have taken far longer than it did			1
