by @entity0 published : 06:07 est , 12 october 2012 updated : 08:24 est , 12 october 2012 the submarine that sank @entity4 warship the @entity5 during the @entity7 war was involved in a top secret raid to steal a state - of - the - art listening device from the @entity10 just weeks later , it has emerged			2
details of the daring mission in the @entity13 , involving the notorious @entity14 , have remained under - wraps for almost 30 years - until now			1
the nuclear - powered attack submarine famously sank the @entity5 on may 2 1982 , killing 323 men , the day the @entity16 began			2
daring mission : @entity14 , a nuclear - powered attack submarine , ( pictured ) was tasked with stealing a two - mile string of hydrophones , known as a towedarray sonar , from a @entity25 - flagged spy trawler but just eight weeks later , the submarine was tasked with stealing a two - mile string of hydrophones , known as a towedarray sonar , from a @entity25 - flagged spy trawler , close to @entity10 waters			1
these trawlers , known as @entity33 , or @entity34 , were dedicated to gathering intelligence and were common during the @entity36 , often masquerading as fishing trawlers			0
the device attached to this particular trawler was wanted by the @entity41 and the @entity42 as it was regarded as the most up - to - date device in @entity45 submarine detection technology , the @entity38 said			1
it was designed to subtly listen to enemy submarines and the @entity42 wanted to find out how the enemy had managed to develop it			1
during the 1970s they had begun to notice that @entity10 submarines were becoming quieter and faster , and had started to fear that they were n't making as much progress in naval technology as they should be			2
sunk : @entity14 famously sank the @entity5 ( pictured ) on may 2 1982 , killing 323 men , the day the @entity16 began - but it was involved in another daring mission two months later going under : footage of the @entity5 in flames as it sinks after being hit by @entity14 known as @entity58 , the crew , captained by @entity59 , had been ordered to cut through a three - inch - thick steel cable in order to release it from the trawler , without being seen			1
they used special pincers , designed by the @entity42 to do this , in a bid to make it look like it had snagged accidentally and been torn off			1
after hauling the cable on board the plan was to send it to the @entity73 for analysis			2
the operation required skillful seamanship as the @entity14 had to emerge from below into the ship 's blind spot and cut the cable just yards from the vessel and its propeller			1
@entity81 revealed the operation 's details in his book @entity85 and said just one minor miscalculation could have spelled disaster for the whole operation			0
one of the crew said : ' everyone in the control room was tense			0
we were expecting at any time that we would be discovered and were ready to run , if necessary			0
' captain : commander @entity59 , @entity95 , outside @entity96 with his son , @entity98 , aged 10 , after being presented with the @entity99 the @entity14 , based on the @entity100 , had tried twice before to severe the cable from the boat before her final , successful attempt in august 1982			1
after releasing the cable the vessel sank into the depths of the freezing @entity107 water without being seen			0
had they been caught the crew would have risked immediate attack			0
none of the crew interviewed for mr @entity81 's book have revealed the location of the operation , but it is believed to have occurred in @entity10 waters just three miles from the coast			0
he wanted the @entity120 to release the details under the 30 - year rule but they refused			2
however , they said they would n't stop him writing about it			0
mr @entity81 said : ' this was a quite remarkable feat , a daring exploit that carried with it immense risk ' .			0

@entity14 was tasked with stealing a two - mile string of hydrophones from a @entity25 - flagged spy trawler
it did n't emit a signal and was designed to subtly listen to enemy submarines
the @entity42 wanted to find out how the enemy had managed to develop it
the crew got *perilously* close to the trawler to cut through a three - inch - thick steel cable without being seen
