@entity0 has urged @entity1 to create a ' destructive force ' by pairing @entity3 with captain @entity4 for their assault on this year 's @entity7			1
former @entity1 number eight @entity8 believes head coach @entity10 must ' go down that route ' and end @entity13 exile to boost the host nation 's hopes of glory			2
@entity1 have continued to overlook @entity3 since his 2011 move to @entity18 , sticking to their rule of not selecting overseas - based stars			1
@entity18 's flanker @entity3 ( right ) runs with the ball against @entity23 , with the back - rower in line to be given special dispensation to feature for @entity1 at the @entity7 despite playing in @entity27 the @entity28 is understood to be ready to invoke the exceptional circumstances clause in that ruling to hand 29 - year - old @entity3 a @entity7 call at number eight			1
the five - cap back - rower could then operate alongside flanker @entity4 , leaving the @entity1 captain 's @entity35 team - mate easter predicting a mouth - watering combination			2
' that would be a real destructive force to have not one but two of that type of player in the back - row , ' @entity8 told @entity44			0
' i think you 've got to go down that route , you 've got a great opportunity in @entity1			2
and yeah it might be frowned upon , but @entity50 had to succumb to it and bring players back			0
and it is a one off for the @entity7 , and it 's a great opportunity			0
@entity3 could be paired alongside captain @entity4 , with former @entity1 no 8 @entity0 believing the pair would form a ' destructive force ' at the upcoming @entity7 ' it certainly suggests that if you 're going to bring someone like that in then they are more than likely going to be in the squad			1
' @entity4 is expected back shortly after a month on the sidelines with shoulder trouble , after managing to avoid surgery that would have threatened his @entity67 participation			0
@entity18 's @entity3 will not be considered for @entity67 selection , but @entity1 coach @entity10 is still considering drafting him into the summer 's @entity7 training squad			1
@entity3 's long - mooted return had initially hinted at a straight fight for the openside flanker berth with captain @entity4 , but his club switch to number eight raises the prospect of the two working in tandem			0
@entity3 's move to @entity27 to play his club rugby means he has won just five caps for @entity1 since 2009 ' you 've got to have your best players available , and if other guys are upset by it then their mental mindset is not right , ' said @entity0			1
' they should be thinking ' bring on the challenge and the competition ' and just hope they 've got enough to prove themselves worthy of a place in the squad			0
' @entity3 has obviously played the majority of his rugby at flanker , but has performed very well at number eight at @entity18 this season			2
' he 's one of the best breakdown exponents in the world and i think @entity1 would certainly benefit from having him and @entity4 ( @entity101 ) in there together			0

@entity3 could feature for @entity1 at 2015 @entity7
@entity18 star could be given special dispensation by @entity28 to feature
@entity3 set to be given *international* chance with may call up
