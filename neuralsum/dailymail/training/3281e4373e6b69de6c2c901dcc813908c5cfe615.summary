the cities of the future will be covered in ' glow - in - the - dark dust ' and fed by ' urban farms ' growing both on and inside buildings , according to a new report			1
spray - on light absorbing dust would give public buildings , roads and pathways a phosphorescent shine at night , helping to improve the safety of parks and alleyways			1
even trees could be made to glow in the dark by splicing bioluminescent genes into their trunks and branches , say experts at @entity19 , the engineering and design consultancy behind @entity23 's @entity22 project - which hopes to build a new footbridge and public garden spanning the @entity26 linking @entity27 to @entity28 engineering firm @entity19 thinks spray - on light absorbing dust would give public buildings , roads and pathways a phosphorescent shine at night , as pictured in this artist 's impression the spray - on dust and glowing trees would make street lighting less necessary , thus reducing the carbon footprint of urban centres , making them more environmentally friendly			1
designers and engineers at @entity19 looked at ways of protecting urban areas and improving the lives of city dwellers in a world transformed by global warming and growing populations			2
the report highlights natural solutions such as preventing flooding by replacing hard concrete and tarmac with permeable surfaces , and increasing tree cover			2
to meet the increasing demand for food , vertical ' urban farms ' are also forecast with crops being grown in and on city buildings			1
glowing : trees could be made to glow in the dark by splicing bioluminescent genes into their trunks and branches , say experts at engineering and design consultancy @entity19 @entity69 could also contribute to food supplies by providing places where people can forage for fruits , edible greenery and even insects			1
' by 2050 , it is predicted that the human population will have reached nine billion with 75per cent of people living in cities , ' said @entity19 's landscape architecture group leader @entity80			2
' adaptations to existing city spaces , enabled by rapid technological innovation , will serve as major catalysts in the shift toward increasing sustainability , resilience and adaptability in dense urban environments			0
' increasing the number of green spaces in cities was expected to increase life expectancy by up to five years by encouraging people to take more exercise			0
absence from work through sickness was also likely to be reduced			0
research has shown that people who work in buildings overlooking parkland took almost a quarter less time off than those with no green views			0
growing green : plant - covered high - rise city blocks could help increase life expectancy and reduce absences at work through sickness , according to the report by @entity19 increased demand : vertical urban farms would help provide food for the growing city populations @entity116 , a @entity117 company based in @entity118 , @entity119 , already produces a product called @entity121 that can be sprayed on any solid surface to make it glow in the dark			1
the coating contains particles that harvest the sun 's rays during the day and emit a soft blue light at night			0
' @entity121 has the potential to reduce the need for complex lighting installations in parks and alleyways while allowing for the introduction of lighting and the safety and security that brings , ' said the @entity19 report			2
' another benefit is that since it 's non-reflective and relatively low intensity , it does n't add to light pollution			0
' a public footpath constructed with @entity121 is currently being tested in @entity144 's @entity143 in @entity145 .			0

spray - on light absorbing dust would make roads and pathways glow at night
phosphorescent shine would reduce the need for street lighting
trees could glow in the dark if bioluminescent genes were spliced into them
report is the work of engineering and design consultancy @entity19
replace concrete with permeable substances to reduce flooding , say experts
vertical urban farms would also help meet the growing demand for food
