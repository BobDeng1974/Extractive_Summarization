the @entity13 researchers hope that the finding may lead to the creation of new painkillers that work by blocking pain signals			2
the scientists compared the gene sequence of the girl , who has congenital insensitivity to pain , with the gene sequences of her parents who do not have the condition			1
the girl 's condition means that she can feel touch but not pain and , as a result , is liable to burn herself - because she can not tell if something is too hot to touch - and suffer frequent injuries			2
this comparison allowed dr @entity36 , at @entity37 in @entity13 , to find a mutation in the @entity40 gene , @entity34 reports			1
the gene influences the creation of channels on pain - sensing neurones			1
ions pass along these channels causing the development of electrical nerve impulses that go to the brain			1
these nerve impulses cause the brain to register pain			1
the mutation in the girl ’s @entity40 gene means that the charge neurones need to transmit an electrical impulse can not build up			1
as a result , the body can not detect pain			0
to ensure that their suspicions were correct , the researchers bred mice with the mutated @entity40 gene and then tested their ability to detect pain			1
they found that these animals were much more likely to suffer injuries than ordinary mice are , suggesting that they are also unable to feel pain			0
these mice were also much slower to react to pain when their tails were exposed to a hot light			0
the scientists have already begun work on a drug that blocks the @entity40 channel			2
the @entity13 researchers hope that the finding may lead to the creation of new painkillers that work by blocking pain signals ‘ this is a cracking paper , and great science , ’ professor @entity81 of the @entity82 told @entity34			0
‘ it 's completely unexpected and not what people had been looking for , ’ he added			0
congenital insensitivity to pain ( @entity89 ) is a rare condition that means a person can not feel pain			1
people with the condition are able to feel touch but can not feel pain			0
they often suffer unnoticed infections and injuries which can become serious as they are not treated			0
the condition can be caused by a gene mutation but it can also be caused by the brain over-producing endorphins			2
congenital insensitivity to pain ( @entity89 ) is a rare condition that means a person can not feel pain			1
people with the condition are able to feel touch and temperature but can not feel pain			0
they often suffer unnoticed infections and injuries which can become serious as they are not treated			0
the condition can be caused by a gene mutation but it can also be caused by the brain over-producing endorphins			2
@entity89 is so rare that only about 20 cases have been reported in scientific literature .			0

girl has congenital insensitivity to pain , which means she ca *n't* perceive pain
scientists looked at her gene sequence and compared it to those of her parents who do not have the condition - found mutation in @entity40 gene
this influences the creation of channels on pain - sensing neurones
ions pass along these channels causing development of electrical nerve impulses that go to the brain - these cause the brain to register pain
new painkillers could block this channel
