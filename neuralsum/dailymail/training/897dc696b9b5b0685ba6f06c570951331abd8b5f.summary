the use of the image on 200,000 promotional postcards which say ‘ should have used @entity9 ’ has attracted criticism - but the company insists it merely shows a woman caught out by the weather			1
@entity14 , manager of @entity9 in @entity15 , south - east @entity16 , said his inspiration for the campaign came from seeing his teenage daughters coming home from a night out looking drenched			1
controversial : the use of the image on 200,000 promotional postcards which say ' should have used @entity9 ' has attracted criticism - but the company insists it merely shows a woman caught out by the weather postcard : the firm 's message signed off with the mock address : ' @entity30 , 5 @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 ' but @entity34 said the advertising was ‘ a really unfortunate and misguided piece of advertising ’			1
@entity38 from the charity said : ‘ the best case scenario , giving the company the benefit of the doubt , is that they 're not aware of the associations that the image on this postcard conjures			0
‘ the worst case scenario is that they 've knowingly used scare - mongering , sexist and victim - blaming imagery and messaging in a cynical marketing ploy			0
’ when the postcard was sent out it started a wave of outrage , with angry comments left on the @entity59 feed and complaints to the @entity61 and @entity62			0
defence : @entity14 , manager of @entity9 in @entity15 , south - east @entity16 , said his inspiration for the campaign came from seeing his teenage daughters coming home from a night out looking drenched complaint : one @entity59 user said shadows on the girl 's body resembled bruising and she looked in distress however mr @entity14 said : ‘ the way we viewed the image , it is simply a girl who has gone out on a hot summer evening and the predicable @entity81 weather has opened the heavens and she got soaking wet			1
' the worst case scenario is that they 've knowingly used scare - mongering , sexist and victim - blaming imagery and messaging in a cynical marketing ploy ' @entity38 , @entity89 ‘ this is something we see every year and this year we decided to place an advertising campaign with this in mind			2
’ he said the wording on the back of the postcard makes it clear , saying : ‘ you should look just as great coming home as you did going out , so do n't gamble on the weather ... get a @entity9 minicab			2
’ but one commenter on @entity59 said shadows on the girl 's body resembled bruising and she looked in some distress , likening it to adverts for @entity62 ’s minicab safety campaign @entity110			2
headquarters : @entity9 is based at the @entity113 of @entity16 office in @entity15 , south - east @entity16 @entity115 said : ‘ check the bruises on her arms			1
that 's what bothered me			0
' use our cabs - or u gon na get raped ! ’ ' it is simply a girl who has gone out on a hot summer evening and the predicable @entity81 weather has opened the heavens and she got soaking wet ' @entity128 , @entity9 however mr @entity14 added : ‘ i think in life people see everything in different ways			2
most people who have looked at it , i 'd say 99.5 per cent , have seen it exactly for what it is			0
‘ the comments can be frustrating as we promote safety more than any other minicab company in @entity16 and would obviously apologise if we have offending anyone			0
’ he said : ‘ data cars have always been at the forefront with safety ideas and were the first local company to introduce drivers ' id badges way back in the 1990s as well as the first to text the vehicle details of the customer nearly 10 years ago			0
