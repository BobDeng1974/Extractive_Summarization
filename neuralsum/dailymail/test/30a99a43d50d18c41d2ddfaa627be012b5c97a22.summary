@entity0 may have been dead for 90 years , but his corpse looks better than the day he passed			1
this is the claim made by his embalmers , who have developed experimental techniques to maintain the look and feel of the communist revolutionary 's body			1
they brag that their technique has been the result of almost a century of fine - tuning , creating a science that has benefited real - world medical applications			0
this is the claim made by his embalmers , who have developed experimental techniques to maintain the look and feel of the communist revolutionary 's body			1
pictured is his body in 1997 the gruesome job is the responsibility of a team known as the ' @entity25 ' which , at its peak , involved 200 scientists working in a lab dedicated to the former leader 's corpse			1
according to a detailed report by @entity33 in @entity34 , the @entity31 prefer to preserve the body 's shape , weight , colour and flexibility , rather than biological tissue			1
' they have to substitute occasional parts of skin and flesh with plastics and other materials , ' @entity42 , professor of social anthropology at the @entity44 , @entity41 told mr @entity33			1
' that makes it dramatically different from everything in the past , such as mummification			0
' @entity42 has published a paper on this project in the journal @entity57 , along with a book , ' everything was forever , until it was no more : the last @entity61 generation			0
' the @entity64 leader 's remains were embalmed on @entity66 's orders when he died aged 53 in 1924 and kept on display in @entity68 apart from a period in the @entity70 the revolutionary 's body is on public display in a mausoleum on @entity68 's @entity75 more than two decades after the break - up of the former @entity61			1
@entity0 was behind the @entity64 take - over of power in @entity31 in 1917			2
he was also the architect and first head of the @entity61			0
born in @entity80 , he was expelled from university for his radical policies while studying law			0
this prompted him to move to @entity85 , where he became a revolutionary			0
he was arrested and exiled to @entity87			0
he later spent most of his time in western @entity89 , where he became the leader of the ' @entity64 ' faction of the @entity31 @entity92			2
in 1917 , @entity0 returned to @entity31 where he led what was to be known as the @entity94			2
around three years of civil war followed in which millions died			2
in 1918 , @entity0 survived an assassination attempt , but was severely wounded			2
in 1922 he suffered a stroke from which he never fully recovered			0
but this year @entity31 officials closed @entity75 so that scientists could prepare the body for public display during @entity0 's 145th birthday anniversary – which took place yesterday			1
in his book , @entity42 describes how a mild bleach is often used to deal with occasional fungus stains on @entity0 's face			1
one such stain that appeared on @entity0 's cheek had the embalmers worried for their lives when they were unable to remove it			1
' they might have even killed us , ' @entity114 , who managed to bleach away the mould , told @entity118			0
' the atmosphere of fear and terror was there for us scientists , just as it was for everyone in the society			0
' the skin is studied each week using precision instruments that can measure moisture , colour and contour to look for signs of dehydration			0
every two years and the body is immersed in a bath of glycerol and potassium acetate for 30 days – a technique which scientists say could make the body last for centuries			1
while @entity0 's blood , bodily fluids and internal organs were removed , his eyebrows , moustache and goatee are his own			1
a material made of paraffin , glycerin and carotene is used to replace most of @entity0 's skin			1
@entity0 was behind the @entity64 take - over of power in @entity31 in 1917			2
he was also the architect and first head of the @entity61			0
he is pictured here in 1918 , six years before his death some of the techniques have had real - world medical applications , according to @entity34			0
for instance , one technique inspired technology used to keeping the blood moving through donor kidneys during transplantation			0
the @entity64 leader 's remains were embalmed on @entity66 's orders when he died aged 53 in 1924 and kept on display in @entity68 apart from a period in the @entity70			0
in 2012 , @entity31 was edging towards a historic decision to bury the embalmed corpse of the founder of the @entity61			0
the former culture minister @entity174 said it was ' absurd ' that @entity0 had not been laid to rest 88 years after his death			1
calling for him to be buried in a normal grave , as @entity0 himself had requested , @entity174 said : ' maybe something would change for the better in our lives then			2
' @entity181 has repeatedly postponed a decision on burial , arguing that @entity0 remained an icon for many elderly @entity31			2
the revolutionary 's body is on public display in a mausoleum on @entity68 's @entity75 more than two decades after the break - up of the former @entity61			1
