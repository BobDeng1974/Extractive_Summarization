only a brilliant late save from @entity1 's debutant goalkeeper @entity0 prevented @entity1 dropping two points at the @entity3 against @entity4			1
the club 's relentless production line of young players ticked off another couple of teenage debuts as @entity10 gave 19 - year - olds @entity11 and @entity13 their first @entity14 starts but the understrength team selection made for a nervy 1 - 0 win sealed only by @entity18 's first half header			1
coach @entity10 marked his first game in charge in @entity21 by blooding the two teenagers and by giving goalkeeper @entity0 his first start and he was the later hero saving from @entity24			0
@entity1 's @entity18 ( second right ) finds a small gap in the @entity4 defence to head in the opener at the @entity3 @entity18 's header makes it 1 - 0 for @entity1 against the @entity32 champions in their opening @entity35 match @entity1 : @entity0 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity18 , @entity38 , @entity11 ( @entity39 do @entity40 ' ) , @entity41 , @entity42 ( @entity43 61 ' ) , @entity44 , @entity45 ( @entity46 68 ' ) , @entity47 subs not used : @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 goal : @entity18 @entity4 : @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 ( @entity24 62 ' ) , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 ( @entity64 79 ' ) , @entity65 ( @entity66 75 ' ) subs not used : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 booked : @entity55 , @entity59 @entity13 has now debuted for @entity1 , @entity72 and in the @entity14 in the last month and for @entity41 it was a @entity21 start before he has even played a league game			1
there were seven products of the youth academy @entity1 will have to rely on more than ever if the @entity78 in @entity79 upholds the @entity81 ban on them making transfers for a year , on the pitch , and there was even a former @entity1 youth player on the @entity4 side with @entity54			1
he said before the game that he had grown accustomed to saving @entity47 shots coming up through @entity89 and he was tested on 11 minutes palming the @entity90 ’s free - kick away for a corner			1
@entity47 then dribbled across the face of the @entity4 penalty area before setting up @entity44 who shot wide			0
on 28 minutes the breakthrough came when @entity47 whipped in a free - kick from the right - hand channel and @entity18 got in front of @entity98 , much to the defender ’s visible fury , to head past @entity54			1
@entity47 looks back to his sonic best and he played the pass of the night to @entity44 five minutes before the break			0
@entity44 returned the favour but @entity47 ’s shot was blocked by @entity54			0
with @entity1 in total control they started the second half parked in the @entity4 half and with goalkeeper @entity0 at times situated 10 yards outside of his penalty area			1
he had already headed one long ball forward away from outside the penalty box			0
but there was a dangerous complacency to the ease with which they were dictating play and @entity4 grew in confidence			0
@entity18 gestures to the crowd after he scored the opening goal of @entity1 's 2014 - 15 @entity14 campaign @entity1 players celebrate @entity18 's goal after 28 minutes @entity47 troubles @entity4 early on in the match with a sweetly struck free - kick @entity1 manager @entity10 gave 19 - year - olds @entity11 and @entity13 their @entity21 debuts against the run of play they created their first real opening when @entity134 forward @entity133 beat @entity18 in the air and nodded the ball down to @entity137 whose shot was blocked by @entity36			1
then they broke down the right and only the intervention of @entity37 prevented a yellow - shirted forward getting on the end of @entity24 ’s cross			0
@entity10 brought @entity144 on for @entity13 in an attempt to find the second goal			0
the 20 - year - old has already netted once this season in a 1 - 0 win over @entity150 but was another @entity14 debutant			2
@entity13 almost scored with his last touch before being taken off , heading home from an offside position			0
@entity1 's @entity47 gets caught late by @entity4 's @entity98 and @entity155 @entity47 finds space against the @entity32 champions as they kick off their @entity14 campaign with a win @entity1 teenager @entity160 attempts to hold off a physical challenge @entity4 's @entity56 @entity162 star @entity44 shows his frustration against a spirited if outclassed @entity32 side @entity166 goalkeeper @entity0 , making his first start for @entity1 , was called upon to make a key save that preserved maximum points for his side there was still time for @entity57 to save @entity47 's goalbound shot and @entity4 to so nearly steal a point only for @entity0 to deny them			1
it had also been a night for anniversaries with @entity47 marking 14 years at @entity1 and @entity1 supporters remembering former coach @entity177 , who would have been 46 on wednesday			2
both are in their own way symbols of @entity1 ’s youth system and it was @entity89 that had benefited most from this victory			2
beating the @entity32 champions 1 - 0 will not reverberate around the rest of @entity21 but @entity10 will count the debuts to his young stars as victories and be satisfied to have seem them take all three points			0
@entity4 @entity90 striker @entity137 ( left ) went close when his shot was blocked by @entity36 @entity4 keeper @entity54 , a product of the @entity1 youth academy , embraces @entity47 at the end of their surprisingly tight @entity14 clash @entity47 and @entity44 leave the field with a sense of relief having escaped a potentially embarassing draw against much less fancied opponents			2

@entity18 's header from @entity203 's free - kick opened the scoring after 28 minutes
@entity1 *dominated* proceedings at the @entity3 in their @entity35 opener
