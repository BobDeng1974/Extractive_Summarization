any @entity1 fans hoping their @entity3 neighbours might provide a pick - me - up of sorts by succumbing to @entity6 were simply placed in a deeper state of disillusion after @entity9 produced a ferocious performance that suggested they may remain in @entity11 for a good while longer			1
goals from @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 saw @entity19 ’s team destroyed in @entity20 and promoted @entity9 to genuine title contenders			1
it certainly seems a lifetime since @entity25 ’s side were 2 - 0 down to @entity26 in the play - offs for this @entity28 and on the verge of missing the tournament altogether			1
this time everything is clicking and they will win @entity88 , thus likely avoiding @entity89 in the second round , unless something dramatic occurs			0
the only other time @entity9 won both their opening games at a @entity28 was in 1998 , and we know what happened after that			1
@entity6 have long boasted a fine defensive record at @entity99 but @entity9 tore them apart with a first half of pace , pressure and poise that left @entity19 ’s players looking bewildered			2
how much of that was down to @entity108 ’s departure after just eight minutes with a suspected fractured cheekbone is open to speculation			0
what is clear is that after he was forced off to hospital , following a brutal connection with @entity13 ’s high boot , @entity6 developed more holes than one of their famous cheeses			2
new @entity120 defender @entity69 arrived to join his @entity121 team - mate @entity67 and both showed why they are no longer in @entity124 ’s ranks			0
at a corner in the 17th minute a current resident of @entity126 put @entity9 ahead			1
@entity61 swung across an out - swinging corner and @entity13 rose unchallenged to power a header at goal			1
@entity45 got fingers to the ball but only succeeded in diverting it over the man on the line			2
racing away : @entity14 wheels away after his slick finish for @entity9 's second goal taking chances : @entity14 picks up the ball on the break from @entity16 and finishes with aplomb beaten : @entity46 keeper @entity45 is too late as @entity14 's shot beats him at his near post down and out : @entity46 star @entity75 's face tells the story as his side go 2 - 0 down after 18 minutes it was @entity9 's 100th goal at a @entity28 finals and reward for @entity25 in restoring @entity13 to the starting line - up			1
within 13 seconds of the restart @entity9 went had their 101st			2
@entity71 played a blind pass and @entity16 pounced , advancing quickly and releasing @entity14 down the left channel			1
the @entity157 midfielder whipped a left - foot shot that beat @entity45 at his near post when it really should n’t have			2
it was two goals conceded by @entity6 in 66 seconds , the same amount as they had allowed in the previous 750 minutes of @entity28 action spread over eight years			0
in 2006 they were knocked out without letting in one			0
@entity19 ’s team did respond for a brief flicker when @entity73 ran through midfield and unleashed a low shot that @entity55 could only palm to @entity75			0
the @entity171 target was denied only by the slenderest touch by the @entity174 goalkeeper that went undetected by the officials			0
stacks on : @entity14 ( centre ) is swamped by his team - mates as they double their lead within a minute tripped : @entity181 front man @entity16 is brought down by @entity66 in the corner of the penalty area picked it : @entity45 goes the right way to save @entity16 's spot - kick rebound : @entity61 is first there after the save but his jumping volley only clatters into the crossbar @entity192 referee @entity191 was more alert in the 31st minute when he correctly awarded @entity9 a penalty for a clumsy challenge by @entity195 on @entity16			1
the @entity181 striker , who bagged two in the opening game , stepped up to take the spot - kick but was denied by @entity45			1
it seemed certain @entity61 would put the rebound in as he advanced onto the falling ball but the @entity204 man curiously chose to volley rather than head and crashed it against the bar			0
no matter , nine minutes later @entity9 would have their third in breath - taking fashion			1
@entity6 had a corner but 14 seconds and four passes later the ball was in their net			0
@entity16 fed @entity57 , who produced a sublime pass to the @entity218			0
the @entity220 striker squared it to @entity15 at the far post and the diminutive midfielder applied a finish			0
@entity16 progress his golden boot chances by scoring midway through the second half			2
@entity64 , on as a substitute , sliced a lovely ball forward , @entity69 hacked horribly and @entity16 fired in his ninth goal in nine internationals			0
body behind it : @entity45 got his whole torso behind the spot kick to avoid going down 3 - 0 , momentarilly blood bin : defender @entity108 ( left ) goes off bleeding from a wound near his eye nightmare start : @entity68 goes down in the opening minutes of the group e clash after a collision piggy - back to last - 16 ? : @entity15 ( left ) jumps on @entity13 after extending the lead to 3 - 0 put away : @entity15 latched onto a low cross from @entity13 following a slick counter-attack gratefully received : @entity45 scrambles but has no chance as @entity9 's lead becomes a mountain for the @entity46 on the money : @entity16 scored @entity9 's fourth with this finish between @entity45 's legs another lovely move 20 minutes from time made it five			1
@entity16 fed @entity17 , whose first time hit across goal whistled in			1
saves from @entity45 and last - ditch clearances prevented an even bigger rout and @entity6 got two of their own late on as the @entity81 switched off			2
nine minutes from time @entity262 fired a low free - kick through a pathetic @entity81 wall to defeat @entity55 and then @entity74 got another back with a superb volley			1
this group could come down to goal difference and those strikes could prove important			0
@entity16 thought he had scored a superb second with the last kick of the game after curling in from the edge of the area			2
he ran off celebrating but @entity191 had already blown up			0
it is far from the final whistle for this exciting @entity81 side however .			0

@entity9 scored three first - half goals against the @entity46 in @entity20
@entity13 's header from a corner opened the scoring
@entity14 scored a minute later on the counter attack
@entity16 's penalty was saved had a penalty saved by @entity45
@entity15 made it 3 - 0 with a tap - in on *40* minutes
@entity16 and @entity17 's second - half goals made it 5 - 0
@entity46 goals came late through @entity262 and @entity74
@entity9 move to six points and the top of group e
they next play @entity304 , who lost 2 - 1 to @entity306 , on june 25
@entity9 now have eight goals from their opening two games
@entity16 scored at the death but the full - time whistle had blown
