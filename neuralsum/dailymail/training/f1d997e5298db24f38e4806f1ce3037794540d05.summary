with probably the most expensive fuel in the @entity3 and not even showing the price on their board outside , the @entity1 petrol station is likely to serve only wealthy customers			1
the garage in @entity10 's swanky @entity9 is currently selling its @entity12 fuel at an extortionate 174.9p per litre			1
even those wanting to fill up on traditionally cheaper diesel will find they have to pay 173.9 p per litre			0
fuel - ish prices : the @entity1 garage under @entity19 in @entity9 where the cost per litre has risen to 174.9p high end : the petrol station looks out of place in its premium location close to pricey boutiques and prime property its premium unleaded fuel is only marginally cheaper at 169.9 pence per litre			1
the petrol station has no rivals in the leafy street extending from the boutiques of @entity33 to a flagship @entity35 store on @entity36			2
so it may come as no surprise to well dressed passers - by that the fact @entity10 houses some of the @entity3 's pricier fuel pumps appears to come with the territory			2
multi-millionaire property owner , @entity43 who has been a generous donor to the @entity45 defended the petrol station 's prices when it was charging 1.59.9p a litre for standard unleaded fuel earlier this year			1
' they do pay an enormous amount of rent , ' he said in january , ' if you ’re stuck on @entity9 — the highest - valued real estate in @entity56 - you ’ve got to deal with the real world			0
' i have no personal say in pricing , but i will defend their right to charge it because of the cost of the premises			0
’ expensive : the prices at the @entity1 petrol station appear to be the highest in the @entity3 the petrol station looks slightly out of place on the street designer boutiques and stores such as @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			1
but it will no doubt have a steady stream of customers who drive the @entity78 , @entity79 and bmws that stretch along pavements nearby			0
as petrol prices rise in the wake of pressure on oil production , the government plans to increase fuel duty by 3p a litre in january - meaning an extra £ 1.50 to fill an average car			1
chancellor @entity90 is under pressure to scrap that as part of his autumn statement on the economy later this month			0
petrol prices have tripled in the past two decades , but ministers say prices would be even higher had they not scrapped automatic fuel - tax increases imposed by @entity98			0
mr @entity90 scrapped the annual fuel tax escalator - a mechanism under which duty rose by 1p above inflation every year - and cut fuel duty by 1p in @entity104			2
however , he has only postponed the planned inflation - linked part of the duty rise from april 2011 to january 2012 , and from april 2012 to august 2012 .			0
