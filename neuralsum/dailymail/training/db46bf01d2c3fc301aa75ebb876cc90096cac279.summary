these beautiful long - exposure photographs offer a novel twist on the too - often shamelessly narcissistic trend for ' selfie ' pictures which is sweeping the internet			1
@entity5 , 34 , has put his own slant on the celebrity - led photographic genre , made popular by photo - sharing website @entity9 , by including his silhouette in these dramatic shots of the @entity13 wilderness			1
rather that a vainglorious attempt to propel himself to 15 minutes of internet fame , his inclusion of himself in the shots is an attempt to show the relationship between a mere man and the awesome natural world surrounding him			0
communion : @entity13 photographer @entity5 stands waist - deep in @entity23 , in @entity25 's @entity24 , in this twist on the trend for ' selfie ' photographs clinging to @entity29 : a long - exposure renders this cascade of ice in an ethereal blue as mr @entity5 holds on , at @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 @entity37 : the awesome magnitude of the wilderness surrounding @entity24 's @entity40 is emphasised by mr @entity42 's profile in the centre of the frame @entity45 above : mr @entity5 is seen left at @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity36 , in a work titled @entity49			1
in the right - hand image , he stands at the end of a jetty on @entity40 in @entity24 , @entity25 , the stars of the @entity54 arrayed before him , in a photograph he has dubbed @entity57 pillars in the @entity59 : the stunning glow of the reflection of the @entity62 in @entity23 is emphasised in this long - exposure photo taken at @entity24 at one : mr @entity5 is seen in meditative pose , again at @entity24 's @entity23 , as day breaks over the dramatic horizon starstruck : in this shot the photographer is lying on the frozen waters of @entity23 , his flashlight pointing towards the incredible night sky midnight at @entity73 : a long - exposure captures in detail the @entity76 as they rise above and are reflected in the titular lake in @entity24 mr @entity5 , from @entity25 , one of @entity13 's three so - called @entity79 , began experimenting with night photography just two years ago			1
captivated by the spectacular scenes of his home region , he nevertheless decided that to create photographs which were more unique he add the context of the human form into the shot			2
using long exposures , allowing the night 's sky illuminating the mountains around him , he has sought to create a relationship between the central figure in the image and the nature around him			2
mr @entity5 's photographs showcase breathtaking sights from the the @entity24 and @entity35 , both in the @entity96			1
usually venturing out into the wilderness alone , his project is on - going as he gets new ideas every day for how to record himself in remarkable locations			2
@entity101 : an incredible photograph peers up at the millions of stars visible over the lonely landscape of @entity34 , in @entity35 , @entity36 wizardry : his arms aloft like some kind of celestial conductor , mr @entity5 appears to be directing the very movement of the @entity110 over @entity23 @entity111 - inspiring : the ethereal blue - green light of the @entity110 again features prominently in these two photographs , left titled @entity114 and right dubbed @entity115 , both taken in an area called @entity118 in @entity25 's @entity24 witness : another of mr @entity5 's photos which captures the dramatic lighting of the @entity62 , this time over @entity122 in @entity24 mr @entity5 said : ' i was introduced to the magic of night photography somewhat accidentally on mountaineering trips that required very early starts			1
' i was amazed by the quiet and beauty of a night spent high in the mountains			0
' eventually , i ended up shooting more at night than during the day and i still take great pleasure in trying to document the magic that the stars , the moon and the aurora bring to a scene			0
' i find that a photograph can sometimes convey so much more , or at least a very different feel if a person is included in the scene			0
' i like the relationship between man and mountain that it instantly creates			0
so i think including myself in the images helps people relate to a photograph , even though some have never been anywhere near the location			0
' blown away ; mr @entity5 lies along the road markings of @entity151 in @entity24 , as the heavens are arrayed above him			0
