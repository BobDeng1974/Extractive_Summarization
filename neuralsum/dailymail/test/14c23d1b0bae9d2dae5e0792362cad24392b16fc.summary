if you want to stay healthy , try saying ' thank you ' more often			0
feeling grateful can improve the health of our hearts , according to a new study			0
researchers found that heart patients who expressed gratitude for the positive things in their life had improved mental , and ultimately physical , health			1
the study involved men and women who had been diagnosed with @entity15 heart failure			2
@entity18 patients who expressed gratitude for the positive things in their life had better mental and physical health , a study found stage b is where patients have developed structural heart disease - they may , for example , have had a heart attack that damaged the heart - but do not show symptoms of heart failure , such as shortness of breath or fatigue			1
it is important to make beneficial lifestyle changes at this stage because patients are at a high risk of progressing to stage c heart failure - where risk of death is five times higher - the researchers said			1
the 186 patients were assessed for their levels of gratitude using standard psychological tests			0
these scores were then compared with the patients ’ scores for depressive symptoms , sleep quality , fatigue , self - efficacy ( belief in our ability to deal with a situation ) and inflammatory markers			2
inflammation can often worsen heart failure			1
‘ we found that more gratitude in these patients was associated with better mood , better sleep , less fatigue and lower levels of inflammatory biomarkers related to cardiac health , ’ said professor @entity58 , from the @entity59			1
patients who were more grateful had lower markers of inflammation , which can worsen heart failure to further test their findings , the researchers asked some of the patients to write down three things for which they were thankful most days of the week for eight weeks			1
both groups continued to receive their normal clinical care during that time			0
‘ we found that those patients who kept gratitude journals for those eight weeks showed reductions in circulating levels of several important inflammatory biomarkers , as well as an increase in heart rate variability while they wrote , ’ said professor @entity79			2
‘ improved heart rate variability is considered a measure of reduced cardiac risk			0
‘ it seems that a more grateful heart is indeed a more healthy heart , and that gratitude journaling is an easy way to support cardiac health			0
’ the research was published in the journal @entity98 in @entity99 .			0
