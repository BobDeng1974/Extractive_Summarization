by @entity0 ' there 's pot and there 's pot ' : @entity5 said that the decision on whether or not to legalise marijuana should be left to individual states @entity5 says individual states should decide whether to legalise pot without interference from the federal government			1
the former president , who famously said he smoked the drug but ' did n't inhale ' , said he thought there was ' a lot of evidence to argue for the medicinal marijuana thing '			1
but he added there were ' unresolved questions ' and it was up to states to to decide whether legalisation was in the public interest			0
his remarks on medicinal marijuana appeared to contradict comments made by his wife , @entity27 - the former secretary of state who is now mooted as a future @entity29 presidential candidate - earlier this month			1
' i think we should leave it to the states , ' said mr @entity5 in an interview with @entity36 's @entity35 , recorded in @entity37 - where weed is legal - and broadcast yesterday			1
' this really is a time when there should be laboratories of democracy , because nobody really knows where this is going			0
' are there adequate quality controls ? there 's pot and there 's pot ; what 's in it ? what 's going to happen ? there are all these questions			2
' federal law currently classifies marijuana as a schedule 1 drug - the most dangerous kind - but both @entity37 and @entity62 have nevertheless legalised it for recreational use			1
a further 22 states and the @entity62 have either legalised weed for medicinal use or decriminalised its possession , or both			1
@entity5 's opinion chimes with @entity71 's changing attitudes towards the use of marijuana			2
a @entity75 poll conducted last year found 52 per cent backed legalisation , against 45 per cent who do not			0
the @entity78 estimates one in eight @entity71 smokes dope regularly , far more than the @entity80 , where just more than one in 20 uses the drug , and even @entity83 , where nearly 10 per cent smoke it			0
@entity86 view : in an interview with @entity36 's @entity35 , left , mr @entity5 , who famously said he smoked weed but ' did n't inhale ' , said he thought there was ' a lot of evidence to argue for the medicinal marijuana thing ' mr @entity5 added : ' i like where it is now			1
if the state wants to try it , they can			0
and then they will be able to see what happens			0
' last month mrs @entity27 told a @entity102 ' @entity101 ' event that there were n't enough facts to decide on whether marijuana could be an effective medicine			1
' i do n’t think we ’ve done enough research yet , ' she said			0
' although i think for people who are in extreme medical conditions and have anecdotal evidence that it works , there should be availability under appropriate circumstances			0
' but i do think we need more research , because we do n't know how it interacts with other drugs			2
' a spokesman from the @entity121 - a pro-legalisation group - welcomed mr @entity5 's comments and hoped his wife would follow his stance			2
the spokesman said : ' president @entity5 's comments illustrate just how far the issue of marijuana legalization has come since the 1990s			1
' during his tenure in office , @entity5 oversaw one of the largest increases of @entity71 's prison population in @entity71 history - one largely fuelled by drug arrests - and also lead a rather severe crackdown on states that were moving towards implementation of medical marijuana programs			2
' his embrace of federalism on this issue is a welcome evolution and denotes the power overwhelming public support , and the political pressure that comes with it , has on the topic of marijuana law reform			1
' hopefully this signifies the type of rhetoric we will also see coming from a @entity27 presidential campaign			0
' @entity154 contacted the @entity155 for the opposing view , but has not yet received a reply .			0
