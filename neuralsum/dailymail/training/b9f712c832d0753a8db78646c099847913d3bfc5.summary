by @entity1 reporter published : 04:45 est , 15 may 2012 updated : 05:18 est , 15 may 2012 patients are suffering because @entity5 prescription medicines meant for the @entity6 are being sold abroad for profit , a parliamentary group has warned			1
medicine shortages are having an ' adverse ' impact on patients , including vulnerable groups such as those with mental health problems , the @entity8 said			1
in a report detailing its inquiry into medicine shortages , the group said the shortages had been mainly caused by the export of medicines intended for the @entity6 market to other @entity24 countries			1
they said the issue had now reached urgent proportions			0
shortages : highly qualified pharmacists are having to spend time locating medicines in short supply , the @entity29 noted this exporting is conducted by speculators and is legal under @entity24 and @entity6 law , the report noted			1
highly qualified pharmacists are having to spend time locating medicines in short supply , the @entity29 noted			0
but in spite of the best efforts of pharmacists , the group said it had been told of cases involving vulnerable patients not receiving the medicine they need because of shortages			1
these included patients with mental health problems , epilepsy sufferers , diabetics , and even pregnant women in need of medicine to stabilise their pregnancy			1
' evidence we received highlights the stress , anxiety and sometimes harm that patients suffer , ' the @entity29 said in their report			1
the group warned that the @entity6 has been experiencing shortages of @entity5 prescription medicines for four years			1
' we have no objection to the export of medicines in principle , so long as this practice does not harm patients , ' they said			1
' however , throughout this inquiry , we have seen evidence that patients are suffering and that pharmacists ' time and resources are being diverted away from patient care as a result of medicines being in short supply			2
' @entity83 , head of professional and external relations at @entity85 said 80 per cent of their pharmacists had been unable to fill four or more prescriptions a week			0
in its report , the group calls for a ' renewed sense of urgency ' to deal with the problem by those organisations involved in the supply of medicine			0
the government must ' unequivocally ' state that the interests of @entity6 patients must come first and not provisions concerning the free movement of goods , it said			1
@entity105 , chief executive of the @entity106 , said patients were being put at risk @entity105 , chief executive of the @entity106 , said : ' the very least patients should be able to expect is for prescribed medicines to be available to them when required			2
' however , all too often this simple expectation is not being met and as a result patients , some of whom have serious medical conditions that require medicine to remain stable , are being put at risk			2
' the government needs to investigate this problem as a matter of urgency , using the findings of this report as a starting point			0
' a @entity126 spokeswoman said : ' it is vital that patients get the medicines they need			2
in the vast majority of cases they do			0
' there are nearly 900 million prescriptions dispensed a year , almost 11,000 community pharmacies and some 16,000 medicines so some shortages and delivery delays are inevitable			2
' we monitor medicines supply closely and we continue to work closely with representatives of the medicines supply chain to ensure that @entity5 patients receive the medicines they need			2
' we have well established arrangements for dealing with supply issues , to minimise any potential impact on patients			2
' much of this work goes unseen , as difficulties are prevented before they happen			0
' we will carefully consider the recommendations the @entity8 make in their report			0
' @entity153 , chief executive of @entity154 , which represents community pharmacy owners , said : ' pharmacists up and down the country are making extraordinary efforts to get medicines to their patients promptly , and in most cases succeeding			0
' but there is a long - standing problem with medicines delays which must not be allowed to continue indefinitely			0
' @entity126 guidance states that pharmacies should wait no more than 24 hours for supplies of medicines - patients have a right to expect that this very reasonable commitment is met every time			1
' this needs to be treated as a firm and enforceable obligation , not just guidance which can be ignored when convenient			0
' mr @entity83 , at @entity85 said : ' this report does the important job of drawing attention to the significant problem of medicines shortages , which is having a real impact on patient health			1
' our pharmacists have made it clear to us that they are finding it increasingly difficult to get hold of standard , widely prescribed medicines ; 80 per cent have been unable to dispense items for four or more prescriptions a week			0
' this is particularly concerning when it impacts patients with serious or long term conditions , and in particular vulnerable older patients			0

speculators can legally export drugs from @entity6 to @entity24 - even if it causes shortages in @entity6
affected patients include those with mental health problems , diabetes , epilepsy and difficult pregnancies
