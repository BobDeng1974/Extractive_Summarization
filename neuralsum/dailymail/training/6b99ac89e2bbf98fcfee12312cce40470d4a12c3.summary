by @entity0 last updated at 3:34 pm on 6th february 2012 the main @entity2 political rivals today took a major step towards healing their bitter rift by agreeing that president @entity5 will head an interim unity government to prepare for general elections in the @entity8 and @entity9			1
mr @entity5 and @entity10 , head of the @entity12 militant group @entity11 , said they would move forward without delay , although it appears unlikely elections can be held in may , as initially envisioned			1
the agreement , brokered by @entity18 , seemed to bring reconciliation within reach for the first time since the rivals established separate governments , following @entity11 ' violent takeover of @entity9 , in 2007			1
making history ? @entity2 president @entity5 ( left ) shakes hands with @entity11 leader @entity10 ( right ) as the emir of @entity18 , @entity28 , looks on , after signing an agreement today @entity30 is mightier than the sword : president @entity5 will head an interim unity government to prepare for general elections in the @entity8 and @entity9 previous deals have collapsed amid deep suspicions and intervention by the sides ' rival foreign patrons			1
mr @entity5 is backed by the @entity8 while @entity11 has been supported by @entity40			1
mr @entity5 and mr @entity10 had reached a reconciliation deal last year , but disagreement over who was to head an interim government had delayed implementation			1
@entity11 strongly opposed mr @entity5 ' choice of @entity47 , the head of his @entity48 in the @entity8			1
it remains unclear whether an @entity5 - led interim government that is supported by @entity11 would be acceptable to the @entity8 , which gives hundreds of millions of dollars of aid to the @entity2 each year			2
the @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 consider @entity11 a terror organisation , and said they would shun any government that includes members of an unreformed @entity11			2
mr @entity5 has international backing and monday 's agreement said all cabinet ministers would be politically independent technocrats			1
mr @entity47 , who would have to step down if a transitional government is formed , said he welcomed the agreement			0
it was not announced when the caretaker government would take office			0
monday 's breakthrough came after two days of meetings between mr @entity5 and mr @entity10 , hosted by @entity18 's emir , @entity28			1
the two @entity2 leaders signed the agreement in a small ceremony at the emir 's diwan - or meeting hall - in @entity74			0
compromise : mr @entity5 ( left ) and mr @entity76 ( right ) arrive to sign the agreement in @entity74 after the signing , mr @entity5 said : ' we promise our people to implement this agreement as soon as possible			1
' mr @entity10 added : ' we inform our people that we are serious about healing the wounds ... to reunite our people on the foundation of a political partnership , in order to devote our effort to resisting the ( @entity53 ) occupation			2
' the agreement also calls for rebuilding @entity9 , which has been largely cut off from the world as part of an @entity53 - @entity93 border blockade , imposed after the @entity11 takeover in 2007			0
the blockade was eased in the past year , but not enough to revive the @entity9 economy , including the vital construction industry , and many large - scale projects remain on hold			0
the @entity18 leader urged the @entity102 world to stand behind the @entity2 ' ' historical rights ' , in an apparent reference for full statehood and return of lands occupied by @entity53 in the 1967 war			2
the @entity102 world may have to step in if the @entity8 refuses to work with an @entity5 - led interim government			0
the @entity48 currently receives about $ 1billion a year for its budget in foreign aid , and that money could be halted if the international community deems a new @entity2 government unacceptable			0
with the @entity2 moving toward unity , the fate of low - level border talks with @entity53 also remains uncertain			0
mediator : mr @entity5 ( left ) and mr @entity10 ( right ) meet the @entity119 of @entity120 mr @entity5 has said that the talks have run their course , as far as he is concerned , and that he would only resume them if @entity53 made a better offer on where to draw the border with a @entity2 state			1
it is not clear whether @entity53 would negotiate with mr @entity5 as head of a @entity2 unity government			2
@entity53 officials had no immediate comment today			0
mr @entity5 and @entity11 have had bitter ideological differences , with mr @entity5 pursuing a deal with @entity53 on the terms of @entity2 statehood and the violently anti-israel @entity11 dismissing such talks as a waste of time			1
in recent months , those differences seem to have narrowed			0
mr @entity5 has lost faith in reaching a deal , at least with the current hardline @entity53 government , while mr @entity10 has been prodding @entity11 towards a more pragmatic stance that is closer to that of the group 's parent movement , the @entity145			1
however , mr @entity10 represents @entity11 in exile and appears to have had differences with the movement 's local leadership in @entity9			2
some of the @entity9 leaders have resisted his push for reconciliation with mr @entity5 and moving closer to the @entity145 , @entity11 officials have said privately			1
still , @entity11 ' prime minister in @entity9 , @entity155 , welcomed the @entity74 deal , and a delegation from @entity9 was present during monday 's signing			0
analysts said they believed this deal stood a chance where others had failed			0
@entity163 , a political analyst in the @entity8 , said : ' there are several indications that this agreement is a serious one , and can be implemented			0
' the president at the helm of the government means it will be accepted by the @entity8			0
the @entity18 sponsorship means it 's accepted by the @entity173 and will be funded by this wealthy @entity175 state			0
' president @entity5 is very interested in ending the split , particularly with the failure of the peace talks , and @entity10 is getting closer to the @entity181 position , in harmony with the changes of the @entity184 in the region			2

brokered by @entity18 , mr @entity5 and @entity11 leader @entity10 now plan to move towards staging general elections within months
