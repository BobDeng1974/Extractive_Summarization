by @entity0 published : 18:45 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 18:45 est , 15 january 2014 middle - aged men risk a faster mental decline as they age if they 've been drinking heavily for years , new research suggests			1
the study of about 5,000 @entity7 civil servants found that over a decade , the added decline was the equivalent of about two extra years of aging for a combined measure of mental abilities like reasoning , and about six years for memory			1
the heavy drinkers ' abilities were compared to those of men who drank moderately or abstained			0
the study of about 5,000 @entity7 civil servants found that over a decade , the added decline was the equivalent of about two extra years of aging for a combined measure of mental abilities like reasoning , and about six years for memory the study is one of the first to focus on middle aged drinkers			1
the work was published online wednesday by the journal @entity28			0
researchers found no such effect in women , but the study included too few female heavy drinkers to test the effect of drinking the same amount as in men , said @entity37 , a study author from @entity38			1
in an email , she said it was not possible to identify a specific minimum level of consumption at which the risk begins in men			0
her study used data from over 20 years			0
using questionnaires , researchers calculated the men 's average daily intake of alcohol for the decade up to when they were an average of 56 years old			1
then , they tracked decline in mental abilities over the following decade from tests administered every five years			2
accelerated decline was seen for the heaviest - drinking group , which included 469 men with a wide range of alcohol intake			2
the minimum amount was the equivalent of about 13 ounces of wine a day or about 30 ounces of beer			0
the maximum was about three times that			0
experts say the study ' does suggest that middle - aged to young - old individuals do need to pay attention to what their drinking habits have been , and are			1
' men drinking that minimum amount are not necessarily at risk for accelerated mental decline , since the results pertain to the category overall , said @entity80 , a substance abuse researcher at the @entity82 in @entity83 , who did not participate in the work			2
she also said that the study shows a link between drinking and faster mental decline but not proof that alcohol intake was responsible			2
and she said that because of the sensitive mental tests used in the study , the extra declines in performance may be too subtle to make a difference in daily life			0
@entity37 said she believed the difference would eventually be noticeable			0
still , @entity98 said , the study ' does suggest that middle - aged to young - old individuals do need to pay attention to what their drinking habits have been , and are			1

over a decade , the added decline was the equivalent of about two extra years of aging
study looked at 5,000 @entity7 civil servants drinking habits
experts say middle aged men ' need to pay attention ' to how much they drink
