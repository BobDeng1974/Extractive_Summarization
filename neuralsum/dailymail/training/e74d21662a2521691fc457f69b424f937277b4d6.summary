a £ 15 million @entity2 military base will be established in @entity3 marking @entity2 's clear commitment to a ' sustained presence east of @entity6 ' , the foreign secretary has said			1
@entity7 told a security summit that bolstering the @entity10 's presence in the @entity11 would allow the @entity2 and its allies in the region to ' tackle the threats we face together '			1
@entity2 already has four minehunters permanently based at the @entity17 , but the plans will allow for an increase in the number and size of warships sent to the area			1
although military chiefs are understood to have been working towards the move for around two years , the threat from @entity35 has heightened the focus on @entity2 's presence in the region			1
' to our partners in the @entity11 my message is this : your security concerns are our security concerns , ' mr @entity7 said in a speech in @entity48 , @entity3			1
' so our strategic priority for the @entity11 and for the wider region is to build partnerships			2
partnerships for security ; partnerships for prosperity ; partnerships for stability			0
' he added : ' the expansion of our footprint that this arrangement will now allow means we will have the capability to send more and bigger ships , and to sustain them and their crews in permanent facilities			0
@entity7 said the new base would accommodate ships including @entity70 destroyers , such as the @entity71 , above ' a clear statement of our commitment to our sustained presence east of @entity6			1
' a reminder of our historic and close relationship with @entity3 and one example of our growing partnership with @entity11 allies to tackle the threats we face together			1
' and those threats have taken on a new and insidious form : in @entity82 and in @entity83 , in @entity84 and in @entity85 , we face a common but shadowy enemy : extremists who seek to hijack @entity88 to impose their own perverted agenda by fear and by the sword ; who reject all norms of civilised behaviour ; who challenge all structures of established order			0
' the move was described as ' symbolic ' by @entity31 general sir @entity30 and reverses a 1960s ' decision to withdraw @entity2 forces stationed ' east of @entity6 '			2
under the deal , existing facilities at the port will be expanded and a forward operating base established , with @entity3 paying most of the £ 15 million infrastructure costs			0
defence secretary @entity106 said : ' this will enable @entity2 to send more and larger ships to reinforce stability in the @entity11			1
' @entity2 already has four minehunters naval ships permanently based at the @entity17 , above foreign secretary @entity7 ( left ) said the plans would help ' tackle the threats we face together ' while defence secretary @entity106 ( right ) said more ships will be sent to the @entity11 ' this new base is a permanent expansion of the @entity10 's footprint and will enable @entity2 to send more and larger ships to reinforce stability			1
we will now be based again in the @entity11 for the long term			0
' mr @entity7 signed the deal with @entity3 's foreign minister @entity123			0
sheikh @entity124 said : ' it reaffirms our joint determination to maintain regional security and stability in the face of challenging circumstances , and gives further strength to our multifaceted partnership			0
' @entity3 looks forward to the early implementation of today 's arrangement and to continuing to work with the @entity2 and other partners to address threats to regional security			1
' a string of human rights groups , including @entity139 , have criticised the state 's human rights record , and anti-arms campaigners protested outside a this is @entity3 conference in @entity143 earlier this year , demanding the @entity144 and royal family sever all ties with the regime			0
general @entity30 told @entity150 's today programme : ' it 's the strategic importance of this			0
rather than just being seen as a temporary deployment to an area for a specific operational purpose , this is more symbolic of the fact that @entity2 does enjoy interests in the stability of this region			2
the £ 15million expansion of @entity17 means more ships and larger ships will be sent to the @entity11			1
above , the @entity164 arriving in @entity165 earlier this year ' and the fact that the @entity3 authorities and government agreed to fund infrastructure within the country to base our maritime capability forward , both is a recognition from their perspective of the quality of the relationship with the @entity2 , but also of our interest over time in maintaining the stability of this very important area			0
' shadow defence secretary @entity180 said : ' @entity181 supports the @entity10 having a strong international footprint with the ability to respond quickly to events in a uncertain global environment			2
' @entity2 defence policy must be strategically - led			2
the @entity187 and a @entity188 are due to take place next year , and it was expected long term issues like this would be assessed and decided then			0
' the government should therefore clearly set out its reasons for making this particular decision at this time			0
