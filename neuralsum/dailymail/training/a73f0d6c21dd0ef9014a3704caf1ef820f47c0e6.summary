it is every wannabe astronaut 's dream - the chance to pilot a rover across the lunar surface			1
now , it could be a reality for thousands thanks to a plan to put a groundbreaing virtual reality rover on the moon			2
the project would allow anyone to experience the lunar surface by donning an @entity12 virtual reality headset			1
it is a telepresence robot that can be controlled by an operator 's head			1
using an @entity12 , the researchers put two screens in front of the user 's eyes to create a stereo image			2
they also track the user 's head here on earth			2
by sending those mappings back to @entity17 's camera head over on the moon , they have it turn to match where the user was looking , giving a real sense the users is ' there '			1
scientists at @entity48 say their robot already has the backing of @entity52 astronaut @entity51 , and is vying for a $ 30m prize from @entity54 offered to a team that can send video back from the moon			1
' the vision for the demo was simple : let anyone on @entity63 experience the moon live through the eyes of a robot , ' engineering graduate student , @entity14 , 22 , who is part of the three man team , told @entity69			1
' put the headset on and you look to your left , you see the vast expanse of the moon			2
' you look right and you see home			0
you 're looking to to see what it 's really like on the moon			0
' the scientists from @entity48 have teamed up with space firm @entity82 to compete for the @entity84 , which requires a team to land a robot on the @entity87 , move it 500m and send back video to @entity63			1
@entity82 , which is a spin - off from @entity48 , has signed a deal with @entity92 - the private space company set up by @entity93 - to use its falcon 9 rocket to launch the robot in 2016			1
' imagine the feeling of looking out and seeing rocks and craters billions of years old			0
' right now its almost impossible to go to the moo , ' said @entity99			0
' we make it so you can drop an @entity103 on , take a look around and feel as if you 're really there			0
' people have to feel like they are there on the moon with us - there 's something tangible about moving your head and knowing that 240,000 miles away our rover is moving its head as well			2
' the robot is named @entity17 , after @entity22 , founder of @entity48 , and the initial demo was put together in just three weeks			0
the team hopes the project , and the chance to virtually visit the moon , will reinvigorate public interest in space			0
' it 's time to go back , ' said @entity14 ' we left our last footprint on the moon on december 14 , 1972			0
' unfortunately , that passion , that amazing enthusiasm that gripped the world throughout the entire @entity129 just is n't there anymore .			0

robot set to land on the moon in 2016
contains stereo cameras which beam images to oculus rift headset on @entity63
cameras adjust to allow user to move their head and look around the lunar surface as if they were there
will compete for $ 30m @entity84
