by @entity0 @entity1 has warned that plans for a wind farm of @entity5 's @entity4 could compromise its status as a @entity7			1
the organisation has waded into the row over a controversial wind farm , writing an explosive letter to @entity12 outlining serious concerns about the project			1
@entity1 also stressed that @entity15 could be in breach of the @entity7 , which dictates that individual countries have a duty to ensure the ' identification , protection , conservation and presentation ' of their @entity7			2
controversy : the @entity4 is famed for its lack of man - made buildings , keeping it as a natural attraction the director of @entity1 ends the letter by urging the relevant authorities to take the comments into account when deciding to grant the wind farm permission			1
while it was n't outlined in the letter , some experts claim that if the wind farm goes ahead , the @entity4 could be placed on @entity1 's endangered list , meaning its status is in serious jeopardy			1
the letter has been sent to the @entity42 , which is responsible for managing @entity45 's only natural world heritage site			2
earlier this year the department wrote to @entity1 , claiming the government - backed wind farm , called @entity49 , wo n't impact on the @entity4			1
the body then commissioned its own advisory body , the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) , to look further into the matter and the letter is the result of the report			0
proposal : the plan is to build 194 wind turbines at sea , which would affect the view from the coast in his strongly - worded letter , @entity63 , the director of @entity1 , wrote : ' @entity52 considers the project will have a significant impact on the natural setting of the property , in that it would adversely impact on important views			1
' the project would replace the @entity71 as the dominant feature on the horizon			2
' this is likely to significantly impact on visitors ' experience and appreciation of the property which could compromise the long term sustainability of the management of the property through loss of revenue			0
' any potential impacts on this natural property are in contradiction to the overarching principal of the @entity7 as the completion of the project would result in the property being presented to future generations in a form significantly different from what was there at the time of inscription until today			0
' the property will change from being located in a natural setting largely free from human - made structures to one where its setting is dominated by human - made structures			0
' warning : experts claim that building the wind farm could put @entity5 's @entity4 on @entity1 's endangered list @entity49 would cover an area of 59 square miles , consist of 194 , 600ft tall turbines and be positioned 8.8 miles off @entity105 , near @entity106 , @entity5 , from where it will cover 45 per cent of the horizon			1
the turbines will generate enough energy to power 710,000 homes			0
@entity112 @entity15 and the @entity114 company @entity113 are behind @entity49 and they have recently submitted an application to the @entity116			0
local tourism chiefs have predicted a 14 per cent drop in tourism , equating to one billion pounds , as a result of the presence of the wind farm			1
at a recent public meeting held to discuss the proposed development there was overwhelming opposition to it			0
fears : locals have been campaigning against the wind farm and tourism chiefs have predicted a 14 per cent drop in visitors if it goes ahead dr @entity134 , of campaign group @entity135 , has welcomed @entity1 's intervention			1
he said : ' we think this letter is a very significant step in the whole process			2
' we have been stating the impact @entity49 will have on the @entity4 for over two years now and this letter confirms that our concerns are real			2
' the government will be under pressure to respond accordingly			0
' @entity146 was the lead officer for @entity147 for the @entity7 bid in 2001			0
he said : ' the @entity52 is n't mincing its words on what they believe the impact will be			0
' their report really focuses on the significant impact on the natural setting of the site which is what we have been saying for a long time			1

proposed wind farm would place 194 turbines off the @entity4
letter warns turbines will *obscure* view of the @entity71
@entity1 review found project would have a ' significant impact ' on the site
