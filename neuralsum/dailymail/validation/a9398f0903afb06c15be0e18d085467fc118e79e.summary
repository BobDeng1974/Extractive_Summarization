taking over : @entity0 is to fill in while @entity1 and @entity2 find new household staff the @entity4 and @entity2 can finally breathe a sigh of relief after finding new housekeepers to run their @entity9 estate – @entity2 ’s mum and dad			1
last month i revealed that @entity1 and @entity2 had lost the services of @entity14 and @entity15 , their valuable husband - and - wife team			1
now i understand that @entity0 and @entity18 are personally filling the void while they help @entity2 look for some new hired help to maintain elegant @entity22			1
though @entity0 has stopped short of scrubbing floors , she is said to be organising every detail of running the household from her own quarters in an annexe of the 100 - room @entity29 manor			2
@entity2 ’s father @entity30 is thought to be overseeing the gardening , and has been involved in making arrangements to clear a mole infestation which has ruined a pretty lawn overlooking the @entity36 estate			2
it is believed that @entity0 , 60 , and her 65 - year - old husband have now committed themselves to staying in @entity9 until @entity2 ’s second child arrives next month			1
mr and @entity42 started working for the @entity4 and @entity2 in september last year when restoration work was being completed on the @entity29 mansion			1
the property was given to the @entity46 couple by the @entity47 after they got married			0
the @entity49 lived at the site with their five - year - old son , with mrs @entity42 looking after the ten - bedroom property and her husband in charge of landscaping and the garden			0
the couple had previously been trusted employees at the @entity36 estate and it is thought they will return to work there after five months with the @entity4 and @entity2 and their son , @entity63			1
sources say that @entity2 , who has endured another difficult pregnancy , has been ‘ tetchy ’ and can only be truly placated by her mother – one of the many reasons why @entity1 is happily encouraging the arrangement			2
mrs @entity0 has previously been said to be a frequent visitor to @entity22			1
but news of the @entity72 ’ involvement in running the @entity74 family home comes at a time when reports suggest that prince @entity77 is growing anxious about how little he sees his grandchild			1
a family friend tells me : ‘ when @entity79 arrived , @entity2 and @entity1 moved into @entity2 ’s parents ’ house			2
this time the @entity72 are moving in to @entity84 with @entity1 and @entity2			2
there is plenty of space and @entity2 really wants her mother around			2
at the moment @entity0 is getting everything in place because the baby is due around april 25			1
’ the couple have been left in the lurch since @entity14 and @entity15 , their valuable husband - and - wife team , quit last month the @entity72 were the first to meet @entity63 after his birth in 2013 – ahead of @entity77 and his wife @entity97 – and it seems they are set to be favourites when it comes to getting access to @entity79 ’s brother or sister too			1
another source added : ‘ @entity1 is very happy to sit back and let @entity0 take up the reins			0
she is ensuring that @entity84 runs like clockwork			0
the nursery and staff will be an oasis of calm and evenings will be sacrosanct for relaxation , sleep and recovery			0
’ the @entity115 spent @entity116 at @entity22 - with the @entity4 and @entity2 flouting royal tradition by being absent from the normal get together at the @entity47 's lunch at @entity36			1
there have also been rumours that the @entity121 are considering buying a house in @entity9 to be close to the @entity4 and @entity2 and their young family			1
this could be a great help for the @entity2 because @entity1 will be starting his new job as a helicopter pilot with @entity128 in the summer			0
the family home in @entity130 is a frequent bolthole for @entity2 , who also retreated there for a week in october last year as she again struggled with the extreme morning sickness that marked her first pregnancy			2
@entity2 's mother is thought to be running every inch of the household from her quarters at @entity22 ( above ) despite the presence of @entity141 nanny @entity140 , mrs @entity0 was seen taking @entity63 off her daughter 's hands as he dealt with her morning sickness			1
she is said to prefer being there than @entity147 because she can retreat from the public eye			0
officials were forced to announce the duchess of @entity74 's pregnancy in september , which was earlier than planned , because her acute morning sickness meant she was forced to cancel a number of public engagements			1
@entity150 was hospitalised with hyperemesis gravidarum and severe dehydration during her first pregnancy with @entity63			0
but doctors have been better prepared this time and it has been suggested she may even have been treated with a drip at home			0
might we be seeing a bit more of @entity167 actress @entity166 in @entity168 ? i gather that the @entity171 actress , has rekindled her romance with @entity174 founder @entity173 five years after they split up			0
the 44 - year - old actress first dated the millionaire hotelier in 2007 following her divorce from actor @entity179			0
their affair later fizzled out and in 2010 she met multi-millionaire financier @entity182 , 52 , and the couple went on to have daughter , @entity184 , now aged two			0
after their breakup last april , i hear @entity173 , 58 , is back on the scene			0
the @entity171 actress is rumoured to have rekindled her romance with @entity174 founder @entity189			0

@entity14 and @entity15 left @entity22 , @entity9 , last month
the @entity4 and @entity2 have been looking for new staff
@entity0 and @entity18 moved in to their daughter 's home to help
duchess of @entity74 is due to give birth to her second child in april
