by @entity0 published : 09:09 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 12:36 est , 12 december 2012 photographer and artist @entity1 was walking around an art show in @entity4 when he found a series of paintings that looked more than a little bit familiar			1
two of the paintings , on sale for around $ 4,000 , had more than a passing resemblance to a pair of stills he had taken , while a third looked an awful lot like an image captured by his close friend @entity17			0
an outraged @entity1 took to @entity18 and exposed @entity19 , the artist behind the three paintings on display			1
uncanny : this painting of a woman with smeared lipstick and bunny ears is clearly inspired by @entity1 's photo ( below ) exposed : the online art world reacted angrily to @entity19 copying the photographer 's work and that of his friend mirror image : @entity1 posted the original images alongside @entity19 's on @entity18 to expose the similarities he posted his original pictures alongside @entity19 's work , and wrote : ' what @entity19 has done here reveals a total disrespect for photography as an art form			1
' he ’s quickly and with very little creative altercation , harvesting the yield of someone else ’s hard work			2
' what makes a painting strong , is n’t just the brush strokes and the rendering method , more , much more , than that is the composition , the subject matter and the hundreds of creative decisions that go into making an original piece of art. ' @entity19 ’s @entity18 page has since been taken offline and he told the @entity58 the accusations have ruined his reputation and exposed him to a barrage of online threats and insults			1
consequence : @entity19 says he has been ruined financially and professionally by the whole incident he said : ' i did n’t steal these images			1
my only mistake was not giving the original artists @entity70 ’ve now spoken to them and apologised to them			0
' we came to the agreement that i have to take everything down and destroy it , which is exactly what i ’m going to do			0
' now everything is all f * * * * d up			0
i do n’t have a gallery			0
i do n’t have a job			0
i do n’t have any way to make money			0
' a @entity84 - based gallery has since pulled all of his work , cancelled his pending sales , pulled his work from the gallery 's website and apologised to @entity1			1
victim : @entity1 ( left ) was angry about his work being used , but has still urged the painter to continue creating art. ( @entity95 ) fellow artist @entity17 @entity19 's paintings were on sale for roughly $ 4,000 before they were pulled by a gallery concerned by their similarity to @entity1 and @entity102 's work ' it 's a crushing blow to an artist			1
i 'm in no way mean or vindictive or wanting to see that happen , ' he said			0
@entity1 said @entity19 did send him an apology and called his work a ' tribute ' but @entity1 says he should not have kept the source a secret			1
the one positive from the affair , @entity1 said , is it shows how the art world has a way of policing itself			2
however , he does feel @entity19 has talent and should keep painting			2
he urged him to pick up a camera and capture his own inspiration for his art. @entity17 , who also appears in many of the images , also found one of her photos had been recreated @entity19 has now agreed to destroy any artwork he created using @entity128 and @entity17 's work for inspiration			2

@entity1 finds painted copies of his photographs at @entity4 gallery
he posted original and copies online to expose painter @entity19
@entity19 says his reputation is now ruined after gallery drops his work
