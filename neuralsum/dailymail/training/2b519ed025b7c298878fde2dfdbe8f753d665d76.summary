how much you can really learn from putting numbers on something as complex and complicated as sexual behaviour is debatable			1
but it still does n’t stop us wanting to do it - and as a point of interest and for rough comparison , sex research stats are definitely worth a browse			1
check out how well you score ( though do n’t make yourself paranoid ) by seeing how you stack up against the average … @entity13 reveals the average statistics behind our sexual habits , and the results will surprise you how much sex do married couples have ? this is a ‘ how long is a piece of string ? ’ question because statistics vary wildly depending on your age and whether or not you have children			1
accuracy also is n’t helped by the fact that nearly all research focuses on intercourse , rather than other activities like oral sex			1
we do know , the amount of sex you have falls with age and the length of the relationship			2
and as a broad ( and i mean broad ) generalisation of what most long - term couples get up to , this study ( based on intercourse ) gets it about right			2
couples in the age bracket aged 40 to 49 are having sex just as much as partners ten years their junior the results will surprise you : 18 - 24 years old - 35 per cent have sex two to three times a week , 24 per cent four or more times a week 25 - 29 - 48 per cent do it a few times a month , 35 per cent a few times a week			1
30 - 39 - 50 per cent do it a few times a month , 21 per cent do it two to three times week			1
40 - 49 - 47 per cent do it a few times a month , 20 per cent two to three times a week			1
50 - 59 - 36 per cent do it a few times a month			1
60 - 69 - 35 per cent do it a few times a month			1
is there a way to predict how much sex you ’ll have as a couple ? you can predict how often you ’ll have sex later on by how much sex you have in the first year of your relationship			1
nearly all couples experience a drop off point two years in			0
when are people most likely to have an affair ? when life circumstances change dramatically ( new job , death of a parent ) and also when you ’re just about to reach a milestone birthday			0
if you ’re 29 , 39 , 49 - just about to enter a new decade - you ’re highly likely to reflect on your life and identify what ’s missing			2
@entity13 says that these facts are a very broad generalisation and may not apply to everyone if that ’s sex , you might well decide to have an affair , according to results of a study of more than eight million men			2
the researchers also surveyed women and found similar patterns , though not quite as pronounced			0
is it normal to fantasise about people other than your partner ? a @entity94 study of nearly 20,000 people found 96 per cent of men and 90 percent of women fantasise but 95 per cent of us do n’t share them because most of them revolve around people other than our partner			1
how long does it take men to climax ? once he ’s penetrated , most men ejaculate within four to ten minutes			2
how many men have problems getting an erection ? erectile dysfunction affects more than half of all men aged between 50 and 70 but recent stats indicate one in four men under 40 also frequently have erection problems			0
how many women orgasm from intercourse alone ? pretty impressive research that analysed 33 studies spanning the last 80 years found only a quarter of women consistently orgasm during intercourse			0
recent research suggests the size and placement of the clitoris influence who can and ca n't			0
the bigger and closer it is to the vaginal opening , the more likely you are to orgasm from penetration alone			0
what ’s the easiest way to make a woman orgasm ? the most reliable is through using a vibrator			0
men , rather sensibly , appear to be no longer threatened by this , with 70 per cent of 3,000 men surveyed saying they do n’t find them intimidating			0
how often do people masturbate ? studies vary dramatically but , according to research , a good estimate would be around 75 per cent of men and 45 per cent of women regularly masturbate			0
in reality , i ’d put it higher for both - as would most of the sex therapists and people i know			1
it ’s entirely normal to continue to masturbate , even if you ’re having regular sex			2
if you ’re having sex less than ten times a year , you ’re officially in a ‘ no sex ’ marriage			1
this is the criteria @entity160 sex therapists use			2
around 20 percent of @entity94 marriages are believed to be ‘ no sex ’			1
you ’re in a ‘ low sex ’ marriage if you have sex less than 25 times a year			1
how many positions do the average couple enjoy ? most couples alternate between two to three favourites			0
one @entity160 study of 10,000 people found 40 per cent of men prefer doggy style , 30 per cent of women like missionary			0
how many couples have tried anal sex ? around 20 to 35 percent , compared with about five to 10 per cent a decade earlier			2
does everyone give oral sex ? in one @entity160 study , 91 percent of women did , compared to 79 percent of men			0
how many partners does the average person have in their lifetime ? according to 2013 @entity94 @entity189 research , men have 11.7 and women have 7.7			1
if there was a prize awarded to @entity194 , this wins hands down			0
more than a few young people of this generation have clocked up 20 partners by the time they reach 25			0

@entity206 reveals the statistics behind @entity94 *'s* sexual behaviour
