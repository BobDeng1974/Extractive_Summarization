airlines must take action to prevent passenger deaths from toxic fumes inside aircraft cabins , a coroner has warned			1
pressurised air tainted with jet fuel is risking the lives of everyone travelling on planes , sheriff @entity6 said			1
demanding an urgent response from airline bosses , the @entity13 coroner said : ‘ in my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken			1
his family are convinced that he was the victim of ' aerotoxic syndrome ' and was poisoned to death by toxic fumes from plane cabins the warning – which comes after saturday ’s @entity30 revealed the poisoning fears over air in holiday planes – sparked accusations that airlines had been ignoring safety concerns for 15 years			1
the coroner ’s intervention is the first official recognition of @entity40 , thought to be linked to memory loss , tremors , lethargy and even death			2
he issued the warning after initial investigations into the death of @entity23 pilot @entity22 in 2012			1
the 43 - year - old , from @entity49 , @entity50 , had suffered years of persistent headaches , nausea and chronic fatigue , which he long suspected was caused by toxic fumes in cockpits			1
the coroner said inquiries into mr @entity22 ’s death were not yet completed , but he was concerned by his initial findings			1
mr @entity22 ’s parents @entity61 and @entity62 , who are awaiting an inquest into his death , last night claimed airlines and regulators had failed to act on evidence of poisoning			1
mrs @entity69 , 74 , said : ‘ @entity22 would complain about his aircraft being smelly			2
he would go away and come back from work trips feeling worse			0
it is hard not to believe there has been some sort of cover - up			2
’ sheriff @entity6 , the senior coroner for @entity13 who is currently investigating @entity23 pilot @entity22 's death , has warned that those who are regularly exposed to plane fumes face ' consequential damage to their health '			1
he has now prepared a report which calls for urgent changes to prevent future deaths since 1999 , the air industry has denied a link between so - called ‘ fume events ’ and medical problems			2
but a growing number of experts warn prolonged exposure is hazardous and can lead to long - term neurological and respiratory conditions , and brain tumours			2
the problems are thought to arise when cabin air is drawn from the hot engines			0
passengers are usually isolated from this ‘ bleed air ’ – but airlines accept that sometimes there is a leak and jet fuel contaminates the air with compounds called ‘ organophosphates ’			0
@entity108 ( pictured ) , a former airline captain , believes the only long - term safe solution is ' for all aircraft to be built with the unique bleed free architecture currently flying on the @entity112 ' in small quantities , these compounds may not be harmful – campaigners say it is most likely to create problems for frequent fliers and airline staff			0
but the @entity13 coroner said that if a pilot ’s judgment is altered , every person on the plane may be at risk of death			1
mr @entity6 has written to @entity23 boss @entity126 and @entity127 , head of the @entity128 , saying : ‘ in my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and i believe your organisation has the power to take such action			1
’ he said he is concerned cabin occupants are being exposed to organophosphates , causing ‘ damage to their health ’			1
@entity40 was first suggested as a medical term in 1999			0
two government inquiries have dismissed the risk as minimal			0
but @entity144 of @entity145 , who is representing mr @entity22 ’s family , said he has been approached by more than 50 former airline staff and two frequent fliers , and is preparing legal claims against a number of airlines			1
‘ it seems there is a mixture of crass ignorance and a cover - up , ’ he said last night			0
‘ the airlines have known about this for a long time – we have seen staff who have been reporting this since 2000			0
’ mr @entity144 said some people are genetically protected , because they can break down the toxic compounds , but claimed others are vulnerable			0
he urged frequent fliers and crew to take dna tests to see whether they are at risk			0
former @entity169 @entity23 captain @entity108 , who flew for 19 years , said the problem was airlines ’ ‘ dirty little secret ’			2
' @entity40 ' is the term given to the ' illness ' caused by exposure to contaminated air in jet aircraft			0
many former pilots , co-pilots and aircrew staff believe they have been subjected to long - term illnesses due to the amount of time they have spent exposed to cabin air and ' toxic fumes '			1
numerous scientific studies have been carried out since the late 1970s to try and determine whether contaminated cabin air is the cause of chronic health problems			2
symptoms of ' aerotoxic syndrome ' are said to include : fatigue , blurred or tunnel vision , loss of balance , seizures , memory impairment , headaches , tinnitus , confusion , nausea , diarrhoea , breathing difficulties and irritation of the eyes , nose and upper airways			0
if sheriff @entity6 , the senior coroner for @entity13 , rules in the inquest into the death of @entity23 co-pilot @entity22 that cabin air was partly to blame for his death , then it will be the first time an independent judge in the @entity169 has put this on record			1
for years he suffered numb fingers and feet , nausea and a chemical blister on his nose			0
he was forced to retire in 2006 after becoming disorientated during flights , a problem his doctors have linked to fumes in the aircraft			0
‘ like everyone else i trusted the industry … some of my symptoms could be put down to just flying a lot and jetlag , ’ he said			0
‘ the company doctors , whom i often saw , did n’t have any answers			0
’ a @entity23 spokesman said it would ‘ respond to the coroner in due course ’			2
last week the airline said it saw ‘ no trends in sickness rates which would indicate a link with cabin air issues ’ and said studies had shown ‘ no increase in overall cancer or mortality rates ’ among crew			0
a @entity128 spokesman said government - funded research had found that ‘ any link to ill health is unlikely ’ but said it would look at the coroner ’s report .			1
