' @entity3 is currently in recess , and lawmakers are not scheduled to return to work until september			0
both the @entity27 and the @entity78 left town without agreeing to legislation to provide emergency funding to the @entity82 and other government agencies for illegal immigration efforts			0
@entity27 backed legislation died in the @entity78 on thursday night and the @entity27 did not pass a bill until friday night after senators had already returned home			0
the @entity61 - led @entity27 's bill would only have kept the agencies funded for the next several months			1

' if they take control of the @entity78 and all they want to do is investigate and go off on these witch hunts like @entity129 , it 's bad for the @entity61 and the country , ' he said			2
speaking about @entity61 ' odds at retaking the @entity27 in 2016 , the 2008 @entity91 campaign manager said @entity102 governor @entity101 and former @entity134 governor @entity133 are among the most viable general election candidates , though he does n't thank any 2016 hopefuls on the right have what he thinks it takes to win			1
' this process just destroys you , ' he said , talking about the toll presidential campaigns take on politicians			0
the @entity61 needs to nominate someone who is not part of the ' @entity14 - @entity7 - @entity61 crowd , ' he said and is n't someone who ' basically pledges allegiance to all of that hard right nonsense			1
' the only way that @entity101 and @entity133 could win if they are ' faithful to who they are , ' @entity1 said			0
