but @entity0 failed to show at a press conference , forcing @entity2 to issue an ultimatum which the @entity16 middleweight later revealed on @entity17 had not been met			1
@entity2 offered an ultimatum which @entity19 has failed to meet at the press conference on thursday morning , @entity2 said : ' he ’s had the contract since the first week in september , i ’m the champion here and the only reason he ’s got a shot here and a chance is because of his big mouth and everybody wants to see him get knocked out , and that ’s what i will do to him			1
' i ’ve booked flights to go away , i ’m going away on a training camp , spending a lot of money to bring people in , nutritionists , everything i need to prepare 100 per cent for this fight , and you ’ve got him keeping messing around with contracts , changing money , changing loads of stuff			0
' he ’s had loads of time for it , the way i look at it i ’m going to move on after today ; if he ’s not willing today to sign the contract , by 5pm tonight , i ’m going to move on to something different			1
@entity51 ( right ) has had his contract since the first week of september , according to @entity2 @entity53 , boxing promoter , appeared with @entity2 at a press conference on thursday afternoon ' i have n’t got time to be waiting around for bums , that ’s all he is			1
he has n’t boxed anybody yet he still talks like he ’s a world champion			0
' he has n’t got a name , he has n’t got a belt , he has n’t done a 10 - rounder , he refused a @entity61 eliminator , and now he ’s had his chance to fight me and he ’s ducking and diving			0
' promoter @entity53 , meanwhile , insisted he had agreed a deal in principle			0
he said : ' i thought i had an agreement with his manager , and his father @entity68 ; every time we ’ve spoken things have changed , it ’s not got to the stage where the contracts which we forwarded have been signed			0
' @entity0 later tweeted : ' @entity53 has tried to force me into signing a contract without my lawyers being able to look at it entirely and agree on it			2
' he scheduled a press conference before the contract was even looked at properly to try and rush us into signing and agreeing on terms we do n't want			0
' there 's no deadline or rushing when it comes to my career			0
i 'll sign once my management team has gone through and ok 'd the contract completely			2
