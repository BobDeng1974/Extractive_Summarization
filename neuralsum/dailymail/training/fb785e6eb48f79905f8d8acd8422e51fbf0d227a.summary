by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 13:33 est , 17 december 2013 @entity3 : 05:28 est , 18 december 2013 a woman who ground her teeth so badly that she could no longer open her mouth , has had part of her jaw bone replaced with titanium implants to allow her to speak and eat again			1
@entity10 , 50 , lost both her sandwich shop businesses after the recession hit , which caused her to grind her teeth from stress in her sleep			0
at first , the grinding was only occasional , but soon the condition worsened and she developed muscle dystonia - a neurological movement disorder , in which sustained muscle contractions cause twisting and repetitive movements - which left her jaw jammed shut			1
@entity10 , 50 , who ground her teeth so badly she could no longer open her mouth , has had part of her jaw bone replaced with titanium implants to allow her to speak and eat again dystonia is a medical term that describes a range of movement disorders that cause muscle spasms and contractions			1
the spasms and contractions may either be sustained or may come and go			0
movements are often repetitive and cause unusual , awkward and sometimes painful postures			0
dystonia can affect one muscle , a muscle group , or the entire body			1

she was left unable to eat , drink or even talk for months and needed to be given fluids through a tube			1
but thanks to a rare type of surgery , ms @entity10 , from @entity65 , had £ 16,000 titanium plates inserted into her jaw in an operation performed only around 75 times a year			1
despite a successful fitting of the implants , her troubles continued , as the dystonia dislocated the new jaw			2
she was again forced to feed through a straw for four weeks after surgeons took the decision to wire her new mouth shut until the muscle contractions stopped			2
ms @entity10 has now credited her surgeon @entity80 with turning her life around , allowing her to enjoy food and drink again as well as talk to her friends and family			2
mr @entity80 said : ' the only way to stop this [ the dislocation ] from happening was by wiring her jaw shut for a long enough amount of time the muscles would heal			2
