one key to the success of the reverse sting operation has been a seductive , shadowy female informant who has brought the police 63 cases that have resulted in more than $ 5million in property seizures since 2007			1
and she has been paid handsomely for her work - taking home $ 800,000 from the city of @entity7			1

' we ’re not talking about a few hours overtime			2
we ’re talking about police officers who are now making hundreds of thousands of dollars			2
in my view , it ’s all about the money			0

' son of a b * * * *			0
' unlike most police narcotics squads , which try to drive drug dealers out of the community , the undercover officers in @entity7 are actively recruiting drug dealers to travel to their middle - class city of 84,000			1

in 2011 and 2012 alone , the department received more than $ 5.8million from drug seizures			1
@entity3 's laws allow the police to take any money and property used in drug trafficking operations			1
