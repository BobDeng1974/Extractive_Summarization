by @entity0 published : 07:42 est , 14 june 2012 updated : 07:50 est , 14 june 2012 seventy - six suspected paedophiles , including a @entity3 leader , a retired teacher and @entity6 employees , have been arrested across the @entity7 in a major police investigation into sickening child sex images on the internet			1
members of the armed forces , a pathologist and a firefighter were also among those detained in the 48 - hour operation , which involved more than 40 police forces nationwide			1
about 80 children have been taken to safety as part of the investigation , including 20 who were found to be living at the properties searched by officers			1
raids : police led by the @entity28 executed at least 141 search warrants and arrested 76 suspects police led by the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) executed at least 141 search warrants , as experts warned that images being downloaded by paedophiles are becoming more extreme , sadistic and violent			1
most of the warrants related to image offences , including the possession and distribution of indecent images of children , @entity28 said			1
others arrested include a referee , an outdoor activities instructor , a computer programmer and known offenders who had breached the conditions of the @entity46			0
@entity28 today published a report warning that anyone caught downloading child abuse images online poses a risk of committing physical sex attacks on children			1
the report said that one analysis showed 55 per cent of paedophiles who possess indecent images also commit sexual offences against children			1
the report also warned that detectives investigating online indecent images of children faced an ' unprecedented caseload ' at a time when police budgets are being cut			1
@entity66 , a principal analyst at @entity28 , said : ' the images being downloaded are increasingly becoming more extreme , sadistic and violent and feature increasingly younger children			1
' however , the severity and number of images held by offenders are not enough alone to assess the risk they pose or the sentence they should receive , the report said			2
@entity28 urged police forces to prioritise the investigation of anyone caught with child abuse images who has easy access to children			1
@entity85 , deputy chief executive at @entity28 , said : ' it is clear that those who possess indecent images also pose a significant risk to children and understanding and managing that risk is not an easy undertaking			1
disturbing : experts warned that images of children on the internet were becoming more extreme , sadistic and violent			1
( file photograph ) ' however , when we bring together the latest intelligence picture , nationally co-ordinated police action and operational support from our colleagues in the @entity104 , we are making the @entity7 a more hostile place for those who are seeking to exploit our children			2
' @entity28 called for the authorities to look beyond the quantity and severity of the images , adding that a full risk assessment should be considered before a judge hands down any sentence			1
ms @entity66 said the dramatic increase in images being downloaded , and the cuts to police resources , meant officers struggled with the workload but stressed that the notion that any case may result in the identification of a victim should be at the forefront of every investigation			2
she added : ' the levels of austerity and the caseload of indecent images of children is unprecedented			1
' a quick and timely investigation for each case is increasingly unrealistic			0
victim identification is the key element			0
' almost 100 case studies from 34 forces found offenders who both possessed child abuse images and attacked children were ' almost exclusively white males ' , most aged between 19 and 45			1
one offender was found with 2.5million still and moving images			0
mr @entity85 said : ' this is an exceptional number of images but it does not necessarily mean that person will go on to commit contact offences			0
' those not in work , and possibly therefore those with high levels of internet usage , those working in schools or care work , and those in manual and manufacturing jobs made up most of the sample , the report said			0
in 85 per cent of cases , offenders looking at indecent images of children did so at home , with the rest looking at images mainly at work			2
the majority lived with a spouse or partner and of that group , more than half were living with children			2
from the 97 offenders in the study , 246 victims of contact abuse were identified			0
referrals to @entity28 increased by 181 per cent between april last year and march , figures showed			2
the report said : ' this point in time has the potential to be a golden age for child protection , but the evolution of technology is likely to make the internet an increasingly difficult place to investigate			0
' the predicted dramatic rise in work volumes will require a fresh look at policing priorities and the resources allocated to this area of policing			0
' under pressure : a report warned that detectives investigating indecent images of children faced an ' unprecedented caseload ' at a time when police budgets are being cut @entity206 said it raided six addresses over the past two days as part of the nationwide sting operation			1
three people were arrested and four children ' safeguarded ' after 35 officers executed warrants across the force area in @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219			0
a 47 - year - old man was arrested in @entity215 , a 37 - year - old man was arrested in @entity219 and a 38 - year - old man was arrested in @entity218 , all on suspicion of downloading indecent images of children			0
all three have been released on police bail with strict conditions pending further enquiries , a spokesman said , and computers were seized from all addresses			0
the raids related to suspected offences involving images , including the possession and distribution of indecent images of children , a spokesman said			2
the force said @entity240 was a joint operation between 42 police forces and officers from the @entity104 ( @entity104 ) , targeting people thought to be in possession of child abuse images			1
suspects in the @entity248 were identified through local investigations as well as intelligence received directly from @entity28			0
detective inspector @entity251 , from the force ’s @entity252 , said : ' this type of work is going on every day across the @entity248 as we seek to tackle those who use the internet as a vehicle to offend against children be it grooming for sexual activity or making , possessing or distributing indecent images			0
' we are committed to arresting suspects , seizing images and ensuring our children are protected from abuse			2
' @entity268 confirmed that its officers also took part in the raids			0
a 68 - year - old man , from @entity273 , near @entity274 , was arrested on suspicion of the making , possession and distribution of indecent images of children			0
a force spokesman said the man was released on bail to attend @entity274 police station on september 4			0
@entity284 , head of the @entity286 ’s sexual abuse programme , said : ' this supports research the @entity286 carried out last year which revealed one in three of those convicted of possessing child abuse images has also committed other serious sexual offences against children			1
' he added : ' it ’s a very worrying situation and more research is needed on the most effective punishment and treatment of offenders caught viewing child abuse pictures			1
' trying to stop the terrible trade in these images is obviously a huge task			0
' but it must n’t be seen in isolation			0
it ’s part of a much bigger sexual abuse problem			0
' and we must never forget that these images are abuse in themselves and often very young children , including babies , are being assaulted and raped so these pictures can be produced			2

some 80 children were taken to safety as part of the sting operation , which was led by the @entity28
more than 40 police forces carried out at least *143* raids between them in the space of 48 hours
