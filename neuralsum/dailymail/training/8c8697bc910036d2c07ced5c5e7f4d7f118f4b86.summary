by @entity0 president @entity1 has two important jobs - leading the country , and being father to two teenage girls			1
now he has opened up about the latter and what it takes to raise kids in the @entity10			2
in an interview with former first daughter @entity13 on the today show , the president tells her that 15 - year - old @entity15 and 13 - year - old @entity16 think of him as ' a good , fun dad who teeters on the edge of being embarrassing sometimes			1
' as @entity15 put it , i 'm right on the edge , ' he said			2
' but i usually stay on the right side of the edge of being funny rather than totally humiliating to them			2
' the one thing the girls know about me is i love ' em to death , ' he said			2
' younger parents … ask me why it is that @entity15 and @entity16 turned out so well			1
i say , " well , first of all , you know - marry somebody who 's going to be a great mom , " which i did			0
but second of all , unconditional love sure makes a difference			0
' as the daughter of former president @entity52 , @entity13 - who gave birth to her her first child , a daughter named @entity50 , in april 2013 - has a unique firsthand perspective on families in the @entity10			2
and while she told @entity1 that she and her twin sister @entity58 sometimes struggled with overhearing criticism of their father , it seems @entity15 and @entity16 are relatively indifferent			1
' up until recently they have shown absolutely no interest in what i did , ' he confessed , explaining that it helps resolve any issues when they discuss his political decisions during dinnertime			0
appreciation : ' it goes by quick , ' said the father of 15 - year - old @entity15 and 13 - year - old @entity16			1
' understand that there 's nothing that 's going to be more precious in your life , and you are going to savor every memory ' political families : as the daughter of @entity52 , @entity13 - who gave birth to her her first child , a daughter named @entity50 , in april 2013 - has a firsthand perspective on growing up in the @entity10 ' i explain to them , " here 's why i made a decision that i made , " ' he said			0
' and so in some ways , they 're getting a sense of how i think through problems			0
' balancing fatherhood with presidential duties is undoubtedly a challenge , especially with two teen girls			0
' the one thing the girls know is i love ' em to death - unconditional love sure makes a difference ' to get his take on it , @entity13 asked @entity1 : ' what is harder , being a protective father of teenagers or @entity106 ? ' smiling as he considered his answer , the president joked that living in the @entity10 actually makes fatherhood easier , to an extent			1
' well , as you know , and you may have chafed under this a little bit , they do have a @entity116 detail , ' he said			1
savor the moments : ' when you 're on your death bed , that 's the stuff you 're going to remember - you holding hands with your daughter , ' @entity1 told @entity13 ( pictured together in an @entity123 snap ) ' i 've joked that the main reason i ran for reelection was to sustain that all the way through their high school years			1
' on a more serious note , however , the father - of - two added that the most important part of parenthood is appreciating every moment of it			0
' it goes by quick , ' he said , advising : ' do n't just spend time with your kids because it 's good for the kids ; understand that there 's nothing that 's going to be more precious in your life , and you are going to savor every memory			0
' and when you 're on your death bed , that 's the stuff you 're going to remember - you holding hands with your daughter and taking them to the park and pushing them on a swing and hearing them laugh … you just want to make sure you do n't miss out on that			0
' extra protection : president @entity1 ( pictured with his daughters in january ) joked that the main reason he ran for reelection was so that the @entity116 detail would keep an eye on the girls @entity10 living : although @entity13 ( middle ) and her twin sister @entity58 were 20 when their father was sworn in , making them quite a bit older than the @entity1 girls , they undoubtedly shared some of the same experiences @entity13 and her sister @entity58 were 20 when their father was sworn in as president , making them quite a bit older than the @entity1 girls			1
' when you 're on your death bed , that 's the stuff you 're going to remember - you holding hands with your daughter ' still , they undoubtedly shared some of the same experiences growing up with such a prominent father			0
and in an @entity123 post shared yesterday , @entity13 wrote that her dad and president @entity1 have more in common than just the @entity10			1
' one thing i learned from my dear dad is that family is more important than politics , ' she said			0
' tune into @ todayshow to hear @entity1 talk about his most important role : fatherhood			2
