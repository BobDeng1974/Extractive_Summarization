hearing the scurry of tiny claws across the kitchen worktop can produce feelings of disgust and despair in home owners			1
now an animal welfare charity claims to have a solution to help households rid themselves of mouse infestations - lending them a cat for the day			1
@entity13 animal charity has teamed up with a cleaning and @entity16 app to offer customers a cat fostering service			1
@entity13 animal charity has teamed up with cleaning and @entity16 app @entity20 to offer customers a cat fostering service			1
cats will not just catch mice but the scent they leave behind can also discourage rodents from returning the north @entity29 - based charity say that the presence of a cat and the scent it leaves behind will often be enough to scare away unwanted rodents			1
@entity36 , animal welfare consultant at @entity13 , said : ' we have more than 200 cats in need of good homes , some of which will benefit from being cared for temporarily in a home environment , until they find their forever homes			1
cutting the lawn can be a hassle - you need to get out the mower , trim the edges and then there is what you do with the cuttings			0
but @entity52 is now apparently offering a solution - by allowing you to rent a goat			0
the @entity56 service allows homeowners to keep your lawn trim			0
it also offers goats as a way of keeping all manner of other unruly vegetation under control			0
according to @entity52 's website : ' goats can eat tons of stuff ! ' they 're curious little creatures that like to at least taste almost anything resembling a plant			0
' they actually love to munch away at many types of vegetation that we find invasive , ugly , or harmful to humans			0
' goats can eat thistle , blackberry , @entity81 , kudzu , poison ivy , poison sumac , poison oak , wisteria , various grasses , and more			0
your pro will be able to let you know for sure ' sadly the service is only available in the @entity92 at the moment			0
it is also not the first company to offer goats as a way of mowing the lawn			0
@entity100 based @entity99 say its hooved ' grass guzzling machines ' are 50 % cheaper than hiring a human to do the job			0
' we hope this unique service will open people 's minds to the positive impact - both practical and emotional - of having a loveable feline in residence			0
' the service is being provided through the @entity113 smartphone app , which allows users to book cleaners and handymen for home repairs			1
the app allows householders to choose the cat they want to visit their home and offers photos and background for each member of the feline mousing team			1
those looking to borrow a cat to help rid their homes of a mouse infestation are asked to be ' flexible , patient and caring towards the animals '			1
the charity provides litter trays , feed and bedding to help foster families look after their pet			1
the service is only available in @entity29 within driving distance of @entity13 for now			1
rodent infestations are a particular problem in the winter months when mice move inside to escape the colder weather			0
however , once established , a mice colony will often stay in a home for generations and can be difficult to be rid of			2
they are not only considered to be unhygienic but also can cause damage by chewing through wires and furniture to make bedding			0
few insurance companies will cover damage caused by pests			0
the most common way to tackle a rodent problem is with traps , but home improvement shops also sell electronic deterrents			2
natural plants such as mint and basil are also said to keep rodents away			2
@entity36 said that cats were an effective and natural alternative			2
she said : ' the cats have this desired effect because they are constantly giving off invisible signals around the place			2
' when a cat rubs his or herself against your leg unfortunately he is not showing affection			2
instead he or she is marking their territory and sending a message to other animals , in particular mice			0
' the reason why a ‘ mouser ’ is the best way to get rid of pesky vermin is that it is humane			0
the cats do n’t need to do any mouse catching - their sheer presence alone will have any mice leaving the premises , repelled by the cat ’s pheromones			1
' because of this , homeowners need not worry about finding dead mice about the house , nor that they might have any mousey blood on their hands			0
' @entity200 , @entity20 's @entity201 manager , said the new scheme had been created as a result of an increasing number of requests from @entity113 customers for cleaners to bring in cats with them in order to help scare away mice			1
@entity211 ( above ) is one of the cats who is being offered for free as part of a cleaning service to tackle mice			1
those looking to borrow a cat to help rid their homes of a mouse infestation are asked to be ' flexible , patient and caring towards the animals '			2
the charity provides litter trays , feed and bedding photos of the cats , like @entity229 ( left ) and @entity230 ( right ) , appear on the @entity113 cleaning and @entity16 service app along with details about the animals ' life stories			1
homeowners can then book them to foster them for a few days ' mice are unwelcome residents in homes across the capital			2
' in the past , our cleaners have been asked to bring in moggies to scare rodents , so we were delighted to take the unusual step of being able to offer ' foster - able ' felines from @entity13 alongside our more typical cleaning and diy services			1
' naturally , this is all about the cats , and we hope that @entity251 will fall in love with some of the attractive mousers that come to stay : potentially turning temporary residences into permanent ones as a result			2
' rodent infestations are a particular problem in the winter months when mice move inside to escape the colder weather			0
the smell of the cats , such as @entity263 ( left ) and @entity264 ( right ) is said to scare rodents away but is hard for humans to detect			1
