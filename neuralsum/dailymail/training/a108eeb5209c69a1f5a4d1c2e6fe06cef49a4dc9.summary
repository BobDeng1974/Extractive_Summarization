have you ever been uncomfortably constipated , unable to go to the loo even though you desperately need to ? if so , you 're not alone , as it 's estimated that around one in every seven adults and up to one in every three children has constipation at any one time			2
now , one expert advises that a hot drink could solve the problem			2
this is because hot beverages such as coffee , tea - or even a cup of hot water - stimulate the bowel , easing constipation			1
dr @entity17 , a gastroenterologist at the @entity18 , @entity19 , said hot drinks widen blood vessels , aiding digestion			1
hot beverages such as coffee , tea - or even a cup of hot water - stimulate the bowel , easing constipation			1
her advice is backed up by a study which found hot drinks do indeed induce a ' desire to defecate '			1
' the warm liquid acts as a vasodilator , ' she told @entity32 , while giving advice to marathon runners who want to avoid being constipated during a big race			0
' it widens blood vessels in the digestive system and helps increase blood flow and @entity41 activity			1
' but caffeine is n't responsible , as even decaffeinated coffee brings on the desire to go to the loo , she said			1
drinking a cup of coffee and then sitting on the loo should help stimulate a bowel movement , she added			2
' just the act of sitting there for few minutes can bring on the urge to go , even if you do n't feel like you have to right away , ' she said			0
physical activity can also induce a trip to the loo , she advised			0
massaging the perineum – the area between the anus and the genitals – can help ease constipation , a study found			1
in a trial , 72 per cent of people taking part found self - acupressure helped them have a bowel movement			0
researchers advised that all doctors should consider this technique as the first thing constipated people could try – along with conventional treatment like eating more fibre , drinking more fluid and taking more exercise			0
the study ’s author dr. @entity77 , @entity79 for @entity80 , @entity19 , said : “ constipation is very common and can have debilitating symptoms			1
‘ but patients can perform this simple intervention themselves to treat their own constipation and improve their quality of life			0
it can also help to limit health care costs and excessive medication use			0
” the research was published in the @entity91			0
therefore , people with constipation should consider jogging up and down stairs , or doing star jumps or stretches to stimulate the bowel			0
and last year @entity19 researchers found massaging can help pass a stool			1
researchers found applying gentle pressure to the perineum – the area between the anus and genitals – helped constipated people have a bowel movement			1
this ' self - acupressure ' broke up hard stools , relaxed muscles and stimulated nerves responsible for bowel movements , easing constipation , they found			2
they said doctors should consider this technique as the first thing to try – along with conventional treatments like drinking more fluid , eating more fibre , taking more exercise , or taking laxatives			0
the @entity121 defines constipation as people who pass fewer than three bowel movements a week ; feel a quarter of their stools are hard or feel a sense of incomplete evacuation in more than a quarter of their movements			0
doctors advise most cases of constipation can be treated with diet and lifestyle changes , as it can be caused by not eating enough fibre , changing eating habits and ignoring the urge to go to the loo			0
sometimes , constipation is a side - effect of certain medications such as codeine , or supplements such as iron , or can be caused by anxiety or depression			2
@entity19 researchers found massaging the perineum - the area between the anus and genitals - can also help constipated people pass a stool			1

dr @entity17 is a gastroenterologist at @entity18
says hot drinks ease constipation by widening blood vessels in the bowels
caffeine is n't responsible , as even decaffeinated coffee has the same effect
@entity19 researchers found massaging the area near the anus can also help
