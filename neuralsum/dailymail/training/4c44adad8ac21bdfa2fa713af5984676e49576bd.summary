the way millions of households are being ripped off by the big energy firms is laid bare today			0

@entity45 , of consumer group which ? , said : ‘ energy companies should be passing on any savings from falling wholesale and network costs			1
‘ it ’s no wonder that consumers are n’t confident that the price they pay for their energy is fair , especially when @entity55 has reported that supplier profit margins are set to double			0
‘ with energy costs the top consumer concern , the competition authority must leave no stone unturned in its investigation of the market and must establish the truth behind our energy prices			2
’ @entity14 , which supplies around 40 per cent of homes , is under fire for its costs , which comes despite an ongoing investigation by the @entity24 into the energy supply business he suggested that customers shop around , as small suppliers can be considerably cheaper			1
for example , @entity74 is offering a tariff that is almost 25 per cent cheaper than @entity14 ’s increased rate			1
energy suppliers say the wholesale price of gas is only part of the cost of providing their services – and that prices are not cut automatically if it falls			2
