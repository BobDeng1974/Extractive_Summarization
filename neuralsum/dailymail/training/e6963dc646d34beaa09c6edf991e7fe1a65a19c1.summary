@entity8 – tipped to be a future prime minister – said he had offered his resignation because he had failed to carry out checks that would have established she was in the @entity13 unlawfully			1
he now faces a fine for not keeping copies of the immigration papers shown to him by the cleaner			2
commons records show that the unidentified cleaner , who is now subject to ‘ enforcement action ’ by border officials , received at least £ 2,000 from mr @entity8 ’s @entity25 expenses before second home allowances were tightened up			1
immigration minister @entity8 has been forced to resign after illegally employing a cleaner the resignation triggered a @entity30 reshuffle , with a key promotion for @entity32 @entity33 said @entity34 had accepted mr @entity8 ’s resignation ‘ with regret ’ – adding that there was ‘ no suggestion ’ the @entity40 mp had ‘ knowingly employed an illegal immigrant ’			1
mr @entity8 ’s resignation triggered a @entity30 reshuffle , with a key promotion for @entity32 , one of @entity46 ’s key allies			1
mrs @entity32 , 53 , becomes an assistant whip			0
fellow conservative @entity48 was appointed as the new immigration minister			1
mr @entity8 , 43 , who was ranked second only to home secretary @entity50 in the @entity52 pecking order , first employed the cleaner at his @entity54 second home in april 2007			1
at the time , he had been the mp for @entity55 for two years			0
in his resignation letter to the prime minister , mr @entity8 said he had been ‘ mindful ’ of his obligation to make checks including ‘ her right to work in the @entity13 ’			1
he made a copy of both her passport , to establish her identity , and a @entity52 letter she handed him which stated that she had leave to remain indefinitely in the country			0
government sources said yesterday that as it was a ‘ live operational matter ’ they could not say about how the cleaner came to be in possession of a letter that gave false details about her right to be in the country			2
controversial : mr @entity8 was behind the @entity52 's ' go home ' vans , which were later deemed distasteful and withdrawn however , previous @entity52 investigations have shown that illegal immigrants can obtain fake passports – and supporting documentation – with relative ease			1
when mr @entity8 was appointed as a cabinet office minister after the 2010 election he ‘ considered the issue ’ of his cleaner ’s immigration status , and concluded that he had performed sufficient checks , he wrote in his resignation letter			1
after his promotion to immigration minister in september 2012 , mr @entity8 said , he ‘ went through a similar consideration process ’ and decided against carrying out any further checks			1
given the obvious sensitivity of his new position , mr @entity8 said he now accepted that he ‘ should have checked more thoroughly ’			1
he told mr @entity34 that he only became aware of his cleaner ’s illegal status after he began piloting the @entity99 through @entity100 and became acutely aware of the need for employers to carry out ‘ reasonable checks ’ on the status of their employees			1
even though ‘ we do not require them to be experts or spot anything other than an obvious forgery ’ , he told mr @entity34 that he ‘ thought it prudent to check that all my documents were in order for my cleaner ’			1
the unidentified @entity4 woman provided new copies of the documents on tuesday			2
but when mr @entity8 asked his private office to check the details with immigration officials , he was told that she did not have indefinite leave to remain in the @entity13			1
home secretary @entity50 and prime minister @entity34 both praised mr @entity8 's contribution to @entity123 ‘ although i complied with the law at all times , i consider that as immigration minister , who is taking legislation through @entity100 which will toughen up our immigration laws , i should hold myself to a higher standard than expected of others , ’ he said in a letter to the pm			1
in his response , mr @entity34 wrote : ‘ i am very sorry indeed to see you leave the government , but i understand your reasons for doing so			1
i hope very much that you will be able to return to service on the @entity137 before too long			0
’ clean - cut mr @entity8 , a prominent @entity139 , has been tipped for swift advancement since entering the government			1
he caused controversy last year when he rounded on a five times - failed asylum seeker live on tv and demanded he go home , saying : ‘ we do n’t believe you and neither did the judge , ’ going on to say : ‘ with the greatest respect , when you were here claiming asylum , taxpayers supported you			2
you now have no right to be in the @entity13 and you should return			0
’ he faced anger for defending the controversial vans that toured @entity54 bearing posters with the warning to illegal immigrants : ‘ go home or face arrest			2
’ mr @entity8 insisted he had done nothing illegal but that he ' had fallen below the standards expected of him '			1
he apologised to the prime minister for any ' embarrassment ' caused mr @entity8 's resignation sees a cabinet reshuffle in which junior home office minister @entity48 becomes minister of state , while @entity166 moves from the whips office to fill his role			1
@entity169 is promoted within the whips office to replace ms @entity166 and @entity32 is brought into the government ranks as a junior whip			0
in response to the shake - up , @entity50 said : ' @entity48 's well - deserved promotion is a testament to the ability and diligence he has shown in the @entity52 since 2010			2
' i also want to welcome @entity166 to the department			0
she has demonstrated great promise since her election and i look forward to working with her			0
' @entity182 ’s shadow immigration minister , @entity181 , described mr @entity8 as ‘ decent ’ for stepping down but added : ‘ perhaps once again the government need to think very carefully about how they approach this issue as it is clear there are limits to the effectiveness of relying on employer and landlord checks to address illegal immigration			1
’ taxpayers paid thousands of pounds for the services of mr @entity8 ’s cleaner			1
in 2007 - 08 , he claimed £ 946 on his parliamentary expenses for cleaning and ironing , with the bill rising to £ 1,262 the following year			2
he submitted dozens of printed receipts for weekly cleaning bills , which totalled £ 30 a week for three hours ’ worth of work			2
last night it was unclear whether the @entity200 would have to pay a fine			0
@entity203 sources insist he would avoid one because his cleaner was self - employed			2
but legal experts say this is not an automatic defence			0
under @entity209 , employers are liable for civil penalties of up to £ 10,000 if they do not ‘ verify , retain , copy or record the content ’ of a worker ’s documents			2
in 2009 , @entity182 ’s attorney general @entity214 was fined £ 5,000 for employing a @entity216 housekeeper who was in the @entity13 illegally – because she failed to keep copies of her papers			1
new assistant whip @entity32 was educated at £ 31,000 - a - year @entity219 , the @entity220 school attended by @entity221			0
she spent two decades at investment bank @entity223 , before winning the safe @entity40 seat of @entity225 in 2010			2
another beneficiary of the reshuffle is comprehensive - educated @entity40 @entity166 , who becomes a junior minister at the @entity52			1
in april 2007 i took on a cleaner for my @entity54 flat			2
in doing so , i was very mindful of my legal and financial obligations and undertook a number of checks beforehand			0
this included consideration of the @entity238 tests as to whether the cleaner was performing her work under a contract for services on a self - employed basis which i concluded she was			0
however , even though there was no legal requirement for me to check her right to work in the @entity13 , i felt that it was appropriate to do so			0
i therefore took a copy of her passport to verify her identity and also a copy of a @entity52 letter , dated 26 january 2006 , which stated that she had leave to remain indefinitely in the @entity13 , including the right to work and engage in a business			0
i considered the issue again when you appointed me as a minister in the @entity264 in may 2010 and concluded that as i had performed a right to work check in 2007 and that my cleaner had indefinite leave to remain in the @entity13 no further check was necessary			1
when you then appointed me as immigration minister in september 2012 i went through a similar consideration process and once again concluded that no further check was necessary			1
in retrospect , i should have checked more thoroughly			0
as i took the @entity99 through @entity100 in autumn 2013 i talked a lot about these matters in the context both of employers and landlords			0
what we do , and will , require of both is that they carry out reasonable checks and take copies of documents			2
we do not require them to be experts or spot anything other than an obvious forgery			0
given this focus on these matters , i thought it prudent to check that all my documents were in order for my cleaner			2
i undertook an extensive search to locate the copies of documents i had taken but unfortunately i was unable to locate them			0
as a result , in the week commencing 20 january 2014 i asked my cleaner for further copies of these documents which she provided on 4 february			1
on 5 february , i asked my private office to check the details with immigration officials to confirm that all was in order			0
i was informed on the morning of 6 february that my cleaner did not in fact have indefinite leave to remain in the @entity13			0
i immediately notified the home secretary and my permanent secretary			0
this is now a matter for @entity312			0
although i complied with the law at all times , i consider that as immigration minister , who is taking legislation through @entity100 which will toughen up our immigration laws , i should hold myself to a higher standard than expected of others			1
i have also considered the impact on my parliamentary colleagues , the government and you			0
i have always believed that politics is a team game , not an individual sport			0
under the circumstances , i have therefore decided that the right course is for me to return to the @entity330			0
i am sorry for any embarrassment caused			0
i am grateful for the opportunities you have given me since you became @entity334 , first in @entity335 and then in @entity123			0
i will continue to support you as prime minister , the @entity40 and this government in whatever way i can from the backbenches			2
i will also continue to serve my constituents in the @entity55 to the best of my ability .			0
