by @entity0 published : 08:45 est , 19 october 2013 updated : 10:38 est , 19 october 2013 back in the game : 17 - year - old @entity1 played her first volleyball game since being suspended for trying to give a drunken friend a ride home from a party @entity1 , 17 , played her first volleyball game last night since being benched for five games and stripped of her title as team captain for trying to give a drunken friend a ride home			1
@entity1 's return to the court was triumphant , contributing 16 assists in @entity18 's the 3 - 0 victory over @entity19			1
but her parent 's legal battle against the school district for the harsh discipline of their daughter is ongoing			2
it was earlier reported that a police officer actually vouched for @entity1 's sobriety at the party , but that school administrators decided to punish @entity1 anyway because of a zero tolerance for underage drinking			1
as @entity1 's parents attempt to sue the school in federal court , their lawyer @entity33 released the content of that email to the @entity39			1
in the email , officer @entity40 of the @entity41 describes breaking up the party and speaking with @entity1 while she waited for her mother to arrive			1
' @entity1 did not have the slightest odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from her person , ' he wrote			0
' she was polite , articulate , steady on her feet , and very remorseful for her decision to go into the residence but was only helping out a friend that had called her for a ride			0
' earlier that night , @entity1 was finishing up her shift at a local restaurant when she got a text message from a friend asking her to pick her up at a party because she was too drunk to drive home			1
shortly after arriving at the house to help her friend , police arrived and cited the 15 @entity63 students inside			2
despite officer @entity40 's vouch for her innocence , the school suspended @entity1 from volleyball for five games and took away her title of team captain			1
no excuse : one of the police officers who broke up the party sent an email to school administrators , vouching for @entity1 's sobriety but that did n't stop them from punishing her			1
above , @entity1 ( # 12 ) with her @entity63 team this prompted @entity1 's outraged parents to file a lawsuit against the school			1
while a state judge ruled that he did n't have jurisdiction in the case , the @entity1 family are continuing to seek legal damages from the school through federal court			2
the lawsuit has made @entity1 's story national news , and many are blaming the school for seemingly discouraging students from being sober drivers			1
the @entity96 published an editorial today , condemning the school administration 's behavior			0
' @entity63 - and all other communities - should make clear that sober students who provide rides for intoxicated friends wo n't be subject to punishment , ' the editorial board wrote			0
' the toll of drunken driving is simply too high to discourage this form of safe transportation			0
' but so far , the school administration has defended their position			0
right and wrong : so far , the school has refused to back down on their decision to punish @entity1 ' while some may decry the @entity117 's actions as unfair or inconsistent with the principles of due process , our @entity117 wholeheartedly disagrees , ' superintendent @entity114 told @entity121			2
' to be clear , the @entity122 has ruled that participation in interscholastic athletics is a privilege			0
rather than simply revoking the privilege , our @entity117 has consistently afforded its student - athletes a reasonable opportunity to be heard before a disciplinary decision is made , ' @entity114 said			0
however , the administration 's decision to punish @entity1 may have consequences far beyond the walls of @entity63			2
her parents are worried the suspension may have impact on @entity1 's ability to play volleyball in college			1
legal action : @entity1 's parents are in the middle of trying to sue the school through the federal courts ' they are n't sure and have gotten mixed answers , ' ms @entity33 said			1
while @entity1 told the @entity147 on sunday that she felt ' defeated ' for trying to do the right thing - she also said she would still make the same decision if she could do it all over			0
but @entity1 is being rewarded for her good deed - just not through the school			0
33 - year - old @entity152 , a one - time high school athlete himself , started ' the @entity154 ' on the web site @entity156			0
mr @entity152 's original goal was to raise $ 1,000 in a scholarship fund for @entity1 , but it seems the fund got more donations than he expected and was more recently changed to $ 6,500			0
as over saturday morning , @entity1 's scholarship fund had gathered $ 5,875 .			2

@entity1 , 17 , was demoted from team captain and benched for five volleyball games after being caught at an underage drinking party
according to a police officer who broke up the party , @entity1 had not been drinking and was only there to give a drunken friend a ride home
@entity1 's school , @entity63 , continued to discipline her despite the officer 's email
@entity1 played her first game since getting suspended last night , contributing 16 assists in @entity63 's win over @entity19
