by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 1 august 2012 updated : 12:02 est , 1 august 2012 it was one man ’s job to show @entity3 at its worst			1
he spent years photographing the city ’s many dilapidated buildings to show the seedy side of @entity3 and how it changed over time			1
for 22 years , @entity8 captured on film a collection of derelict buildings seized from bankrupt , unconcerned or criminally negligent landlords as the staff photographer for the @entity14			1
before and after : photographer @entity8 took photographs of dilapidated buildings like this one on east 126th street ( left ) before it was renovated ( right ) his work was part of an ambitious project to renovate and rejuvenate the city by mayor @entity22			1
the 64 - year - old photographer ’s work has since been exhibited in many museums as a reminder of what used to be			2
since his retirement he has launched his own website to showcase his work			0
he told the @entity30 : ‘ we had to be able to photograph what was really there , and not to sugarcoat anything			0
‘ the commissioners never told me to hide anything			0
a reminder of what used to be : an empty building and abandoned block was one of the many spots mr @entity8 captured on film as a spot that needed renovating now : the spot is now unrecognisable after it was rebuilt as part of the ambitious plan to rejuvenate the city if there were bad conditions , they wanted to be able to change that			1
if conditions were horrible , they could get resources allocated so my photographs were a wonderful tool			0
’ what was once considered outdated and ugly is now trendy he said of how the city had changed			2
mr @entity8 said : ‘ a lot of young people ask “ what was so bad ? why was it such a problem ? ” ‘ they came here in 2005 when brownstones in @entity66 were easily going for more than a million dollars			2
people do n’t remember when you could n’t give those places away 20 years ago			0
’ no sugar coating : as a staff photographer for the @entity14 , mr @entity8 was told not to hide anything like this unattractive street corner in @entity74 useful : mr @entity8 said his photographs were ' a wonderful tool ' for city officials to identify places that needed refurbishment resulting in much more appealing buildings such as the improved block in @entity82 growing up in @entity83 and working as a volunteer with impoverished teenagers in @entity86 in @entity87 , mr @entity8 saw the darker side of poverty			1
he said : ‘ i never held being poor against anybody			0
‘ in any building , all it takes is one or two bad families with serious problems to make it bad for everybody			0
’ changing times : this lot had been left vacant for years and was widely viewed as being unusable transformation : two decades on the desolate spot had become prime real estate and now houses the @entity102			2
