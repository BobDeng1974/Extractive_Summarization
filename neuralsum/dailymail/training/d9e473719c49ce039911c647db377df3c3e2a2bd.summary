by @entity0 published : 11:53 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 13:30 est , 23 august 2013 every child ’s first word is special , but when @entity3 called out ' mam ' it was a momentous milestone			1
because just 14 months ago , the youngster was unable to hear or speak and preparing to have an operation which would give @entity3 the gift of hearing and speech			1
he and his parents travelled to @entity11 where he underwent a pioneering brainstem implant , becoming what was believed to be then the youngest person to have the treatment in the world			1
@entity3 pictured playing at home with his parents @entity18 and @entity20 within a month of the surgery , the youngster was able to hear his parents ’ voice for the first time and he has now spoken his first word			1
his grateful mother @entity27 , 24 , said : ' @entity3 is doing really well now			2
he ’s just said his first word ‘ mam ’ and we ’ve videoed it ! it ’s wonderful			0
' @entity3 was born in january 2011 , and was quickly diagnosed as being profoundly deaf			1
brain scans revealed he lacked important hearing and balance nerves			1
@entity3 is thought to be the youngest person in the world to have pioneering brainstem implant surgery he was diagnosed at @entity39 ’s @entity38 with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder - which means his hearing organ , hearing nerve and brain are not synched together , so any hearing is distorted or absent			1
the family found the only chance of an auditory brain stem surgery was in @entity11 and had to raise money to pay for the £ 40,000 operation			1
thanks to the generosity of @entity52 and donors , the youngster from @entity55 underwent the surgery , but fundraising is continuing to pay for follow - up treatment			2
@entity3 , now two - and - a - half , attends @entity59 in @entity60 where staff and children held a charity event raising £ 1,000 for the ongoing fight for @entity3 campaign			1
@entity18 said : ' we ’re so grateful for all the people who have contributed to his fund			0
we now intend to use funds to take @entity3 to the @entity70 in @entity71 - possibly next year , or the year after - for intensive speech therapy in their summer programme			2
' @entity75 , 25 , added : ' our family and supporters are so grateful for this continuing help			0
'' at the nursery , the children took part in different activities each day , including making and selling cakes and painting portraits of themselves to sell to their parents			0
manager @entity86 said : ' @entity3 is a very popular boy who ’s a delight to have at the nursery and we would like to thank all those who supported such a worthwhile cause			2
' @entity3 still needs more funds to cover therapy which is not covered on the @entity94 , after his private operation			2
visit the website : @entity97 making progress : fundraising continues so @entity3 can go on an intensive speech therapy course in @entity71 next year around 1,000 people in the world have auditory brain stem implants , which were first used in humans in 1979			1
only a handful of surgeons around the world perform the complex neurological procedure			0
it involves surgeons implanting a microchip into the patient 's brain stem so they can recognise and process sound			0
the technology is similar to that of a cochlear implant - using electrical stimulation - the brain stem implant uses electrical impulses to stimulate the brain , rather than the cochlea			0
most recipients of the implant only have an awareness of sound			0
it 's described as being able to hear the beat , but not the melody			0
after being implanted , the device needs to be reprogrammed by specialists regularly as electrodes can overlap with other parts of the brain stem , causing tingling in other parts of the body .			0

@entity3 was born with no auditory or balance nerves between his brain and ear
profoundly deaf , the *condition* can also affect speech and *development*
tot given *lifeline* in form of pioneering brainstem implant surgery in @entity11 after local fundraising campaign
