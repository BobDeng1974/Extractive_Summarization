surveillance footage caught the bear ambling in through a back door and walking ever closer to a room full of drinking patrons			0
oddly enough , none of them reacted			0
’ bears are n’t uncommon in @entity5 , which abuts @entity33			1
but the beasts do n’t often walk into bars			0
@entity27 , who estimates the bear was over 6 feet long , had followed the bear in from the street			0
the 300 pound , 6 - foot beast came in through a back door and looked around for a while , but seemed as uninterested as the oblivious patrons he 's got a tail : @entity27 saw the bear enter the bar from the street and followed it inside initially , he caught it rummaging through a dumpster behind the place			2
nobody may have noticed the bear before it apparently became bored and walked out the way it came , but @entity55 ’s owner @entity54 would n’t have been fazed one bit if he ’d seen his unusual patron			1
‘ we are in the @entity59 , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s their territory not ours			2
’ their world : @entity5 , @entity6 , where @entity55 's ( pictured ) is located , abuts @entity33 - prime bear habitat thirsty ? @entity27 says the bear entered the bar after gorging on trash from this @entity49 too literal ? a bear carved out of wood welcomes patrons to @entity4 's			1

@entity4 's in @entity5 is next to @entity33
' it ’s their territory not ours ' : pub owner says he would *n't* have been *surprised* if he had seen it
