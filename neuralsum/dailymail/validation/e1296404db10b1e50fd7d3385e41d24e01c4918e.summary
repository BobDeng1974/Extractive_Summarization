children whose ears stick out may be self - conscious			2
but a new study shows that while large ears may catch the eye , the trait does n’t carry a social stigma			1
in fact , an experiment showed that adults tended to rate children with larger ears as being more intelligent and likeable upon first impressions			1
a desirable attribute : an experiment showed that adults tended to rate children with larger ears as being more intelligent and likeable upon first impressions			1
a stock image is shown dr @entity18 , lead author of the study published in the journal @entity21 , told @entity22 : ‘ protruding ears catch the eye , but not necessarily the imagination in a negative way			1
’ the facial plastic surgeon at @entity28 in @entity29 said that protruding ears may make children seem particularly cute			1
it ’s thought that around five per cent of people have large ears			1
in an experiment , scientists photographed 20 children between the ages of five and 19 who were considering surgery to stop their ears protruding as much			2
they made a copy of each photograph and used @entity44 to show how the children would look after surgery and showed the pairs of images to 20 volunteers			0
the experts used an eye - tracking device to measure which facial features caught the attention of the volunteers and asked them to guess each child ’s personality			1
the study showed that protruding ears do n't carry a social stigma and it 's unknown why it 's been thought that they may lead to a biased perception of personality			1
dr @entity18 said : up to today , popular comic cartoons with prominent ears represent the less - intelligent , immature , oddball character , like @entity68			2
' a stock image is shown our ears and nose keep growing as we age , but it 's not due to cartilage continuing to grow , as often thought			0
in fact , it 's down to gravity , which enables them to elongate by 0.22 millimetres every year			0
as we age , the collagen and elastic fibres that make up cartilage , begin to disintegrate , causing them to stretch and sag - and appear longer , @entity80 reported			0
the same problem occurs in our skin , which compounds noses and ears getting longer			0
and because faces become less plump with time , this acts to emphasise the sagging of the ears and nose			0
the results revealed that the observers spent an average of seven seconds looking at each child ’s face			0
they spent an average of 10 per cent of that time looking at protruding ears , compared to six per cent for the ears in the photoshopped images , demonstrating that the over-sized features did catch their attention			2
the experts said this is because people tend to focus on what is different and novel in a face , as it helps us to recognise others			0
dr @entity18 said they were surprised to find that the volunteers did not see the protruding ears as an undesirable feature			1
previous studies have shown that beauty influences people ’s perception of personality and the volunteers said that the children in the study all looked cute and smart			2
it ’s unknown why it has been thought that protruding ears may lead to a biased perception of a person ’s personality , but it could hark back to a 1876 study by an @entity133 criminologist called @entity134 , who identified criminals by unusual facial features , such as their ears			1
this work suggested that unusual ears went hand - in - hand with crime			0
dr @entity18 added : ‘ up to today , popular comic cartoons with prominent ears represent the less - intelligent , immature , oddball character , like @entity68			0
he noted that the results of the study may vary depending on the culture of the volunteers , as , for example , big ears are seen as a sign of good fortune in @entity153 .			0

plastic surgeon from @entity28 , @entity29 found adults tended to rate children with larger ears as being more intelligent and cute
using eye - tracking *technology* they found people 's eyes were drawn to larger and protruding ears , but they did see the feature as undesirable
it ’s thought that around five per cent of people have large ears
