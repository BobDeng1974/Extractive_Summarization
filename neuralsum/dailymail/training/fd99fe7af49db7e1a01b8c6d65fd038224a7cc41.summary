by @entity0 click here for the latest leaderboard from @entity3 @entity4 scored two birdies on the par four ninth at @entity7 - as he managed to negotiate the hole in just three shots despite the presence of a local pheasant			1
the @entity3 leader holed his third consecutive birdie to move to eight under par and further extend his overnight lead during the second round			0
but before he could take his putt a wild pheasant roamed on to the green at the ninth and darted towards the @entity22 's ball , then exited at the other side			0
two for the price of one : @entity4 looks on as a pheasant runs across the putting surface on the ninth green during the second round of @entity3 at @entity7 double birdie : @entity4 lines up to take his putt on the ninth hole at the @entity33 as a pheasant runs across the green bemused : @entity4 looks on slightly confused but is undeterred by the presence of the wild pheasant on the green and continues to study his putting line circling : @entity4 walks around to check the green surface on the other side while the pheasant begins to move around the hole and towards his ball looking on : @entity4 chuckles as the pheasant continues to make its way across the putting surface and towards the far side of the green flying away : the pheasant exits the putting surface at the far side of the hole as @entity4 continues to concentrate on his putt and not on the bird itself and the double major winner was unperturbed as he laughed off the incident and was ice cool as he rolled in a 10 - footer for birdie			2
@entity4 is looking to move three - quarters of the way towards a career @entity60 of majors at the @entity33 in @entity7			2
he won the @entity62 and the @entity63 but is yet to win the @entity64 or the @entity3			0
@entity65 : @entity4 is all smiles as he watches the pheasant plod across the green and before he moves on to sink his third birdie in as many holes to reach eight under par three - quarters of a career @entity60 ? @entity4 is looking to win his third @entity74 at @entity3 at the @entity33 @entity75			1

@entity4 went into the second round of @entity3 as the overnight leader on six under par
he extended his lead to eight under par with a run of three consecutive birdies from the *seventh* to the ninth
on the ninth hole a pheasant ran across the green before @entity4 stood up and *drained* the putt
@entity4 is looking to complete three - quarters of a career @entity60 by winning @entity3 at @entity33
