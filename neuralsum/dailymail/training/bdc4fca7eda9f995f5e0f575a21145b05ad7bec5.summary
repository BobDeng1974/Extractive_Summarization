by @entity0 published : 09:21 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 04:08 est , 14 march 2013 somewhere inside @entity2 and @entity3 ’s neatly kept bungalow , you might find mrs @entity3 relaxing in two pairs of socks and a woolly hat			1
she is wearing three knitted jumpers , sometimes a dressing gown as well , and beneath it all she is embracing a hot water bottle			0
in an armchair beside her is her husband , similarly dressed			0
tonight , if he ’s lucky , he may also be in possession of the @entity3 family ’s secret weapon against these unseasonably chilly evenings : @entity19 , the black miniature poodle , snuggled cosily on his lap. wrapping up : @entity3 and @entity22 , pictured , took the drastic decision to turn off all the heating at their home in protest over rising energy costs @entity29 outside : mr and mrs @entity3 at the their home , in @entity33 , with pet dogs @entity35 and @entity36 saving money : for the last year the couple have not been using any heating in their home yes , it ’s pretty darn cold here since the @entity43 turned off the heating a year ago – and it ’s not going to get much warmer			1
because for the last 12 months , through one of the nastiest , drawn - out winters for years , the couple have survived on the deliciously warm feeling they get from knowing their money is no longer going to a greedy , profit - obsessed energy company			2
other more elderly and vulnerable individuals have no choice but to turn up the gas , but in a courageously defiant stand against spiralling bills , mr @entity22 , 64 , and his wife , 67 , have sacrificed the modern day comfort of central heating for the kind of conditions their grannies took as the norm			1
and actually , they ’ve quite come to like it			0
the couple 's dog @entity36 ( pictured with @entity22 and mrs @entity3 , left ) even wears a coat to keep him warm as the boiler ( right ) is no longer used to heat their home scared : mrs @entity3 said she was afraid to put the heating on because of the frightening rise in energy bills ‘ it ’s really not that bad , ’ mrs @entity3 told me from the comfort of her warm outfit ( s )			1
‘ i have to laugh sometimes when i go into the bathroom and it ’s absolutely freezing , but i enjoy the challenge			0
i despise the power companies so much it soon cheers me up			0
’ mr and mrs @entity3 reckon they have saved £ 800 in bills since adopting the no - heat strategy , not including the price hike @entity87 imposed to help towards its whopping jump in profits			1
the direct debit for @entity93 heating was gradually reduced from £ 60 a month , until they cancelled it altogether			2
the last letter they got from @entity87 showed a balance of £ 98.21 in credit			0
money : mr @entity22 said the couple had received a £ 300 rebate from @entity87 on their dual fuel bill in the last 12 months turned off : the couple have no intention of putting the heating back on , despite the freezing temperatures this winter protest : the @entity43 said their protest of principle on behalf of hard - up families all over @entity111 was ' a kick in the teeth ' to energy giants who had hiked their prices over the winter according to mrs @entity3 , it took a little while to convince her husband that abandoning central heating was the right way to go			1
‘ we had a bit of a face - off , ’ she said			0
‘ i turned it off , he turned it on , i turned it off			0
eventually we agreed it was only like living in a house with no central heating , which we all used to do at one time			2
we do vie a bit over who gets the poodle in the evenings			0
’ the bells still use electricity to heat the water at their home in @entity141 , @entity33 , but are adamant they ’ll never go back to central heating			1
‘ it ’s been a bit nippy at times , ’ mr @entity22 , a retired mechanical engineer , says			1
‘ yesterday it was freezing – minus five or six outside with the wind chill factor – but inside we were fine			0
’ the couple plan to use the money they save to buy some ‘ slightly more glamorous ’ warm clothing , as mrs @entity3 described it ; then to take their grandchildren on holiday			1
where ? ‘ somewhere hot , ’ said mr @entity22			2
the @entity43 turned off their heating a year ago and have survived one of the most drawn - out winters in years			2

@entity3 and @entity22 decided to turn off all the heating at their home
they were left *furious* over rising @entity111 gas *payments*
couple have saved *hundreds* of *pounds* on bills since taking the decision
@entity171 said : ' it 's been pretty cold but you get used to it '
