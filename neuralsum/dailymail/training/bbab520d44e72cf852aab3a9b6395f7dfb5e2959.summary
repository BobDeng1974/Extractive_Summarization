@entity0 produced a classic display of hard - nosed and controlled tennis to set up a version of @entity4 in the semi-finals of the @entity6			1
the 27 - year - old @entity7 defused the power of @entity10 tyro @entity9 to come through 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) , 6 - 3 to clear the path to a fascinating contest against @entity13 , now coached by @entity0 's long - time friend and chief lieutenant @entity14			1
@entity0 was like an expert football team playing away from home â€“ soaking up the pressure and coming with a solid , skilfull , tactical game to defy the home crowd and get the right result			2
@entity0 celebrates after taking the second set tiebreak en route to victory against @entity9 @entity9 covers himself as @entity0 bears down on him at the net during a dominant display in @entity26 @entity0 looks to the sky and points his fingers upwards after reaching the @entity6 semi-finals the no 6 seed performs a typical fist pumping celebration after winning a decisive point in the match the former @entity35 champion stretches for a return during his 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 3 defeat of the 19 - year - old @entity10 @entity38 no 1 @entity0 celebrates a first break of serve as he wins the opening set 6 - 3 he will need to show the same kind of composure against world no 7 @entity13 , who is already blossoming under the tutelage of @entity45 , who learned so much from his time with @entity48 helping @entity0 win grand slams			1
@entity13 earlier defeated @entity50 6 - 2 , 6 - 0 , 7 - 6 , and will be full of confidence after not dropping a set in his five matches here			1
but then so should @entity0 , after coming through a much - hyped contest against the 19 - year - old @entity10 whose time looks sure to come			1
this was an awkward assignment for him against someone with partisan backing from the 15,000 crowd , although the @entity7 will have felt at home in temperatures somewhat reminiscent of @entity63			0
he gave a masterclass in difficult conditions on how to pick apart an opponent , who should have learned plenty from it			0
@entity0 has come into a rich vein of form this early in the season at a tournament where he has reached the semi-final or better five times now			1
' it was a tricky match and very windy , i tried to start as quickly as possible because i know how dangerous @entity9 can be and what he is capable of , ' said @entity0			1
' he is a huge hitter and so i tried to keep it out of his strike zone			0
' it 's understandable that he had great support , to play in front of a packed crowd like this was a privilege			1
' @entity0 has a steel - eyed determination about him as @entity9 passes with his head bowed during a changeover @entity9 screams in frustration while @entity0 hits a backhand return winner down the line the 27 - year - old waves as he enters the @entity94 , where most of the 15,000 crowd were supporting @entity96 @entity9 bounces his racquet on the court as @entity0 dominates early proceedings in @entity26 @entity0 has a fine record at the @entity6 and will play @entity50 's conqueror @entity13 in the semi-finals thew 19 - year - old @entity96 played in front of his home crowd , experiencing some of the same pressure @entity0 feels at @entity35 @entity107 supporters group were out in force to cheer their homegrown player on @entity9 protects himself with his racket as @entity0 fires a passing shot almost through him before apologising ( right ) @entity0 will come up against his long time friend @entity14 , who now coaches @entity13 , in the semi-finals @entity0 , who now has a 11 - 0 record against @entity10 , knows that a colossal task awaits him now against @entity13			1
he said : ' it 's going to be a tough match , he is a big hitter and so far he has played extremely well this tournament			0
' the world no 6 had been phlegmatic under pressure , with his serve the bedrock of an excellent performance , winning two thirds of the points on his second delivery			0
he also teased @entity9 with a tantalising mixture of angles , slices and pace , so often giving him the kind of ball he did not want to hit			2
such was his consistency that the teenager never really got momentum going			0
@entity0 took the opener in 32 minutes and might have ended the second sooner than he did , although @entity96 's booming serve was coming into its own			1
in the tiebreak @entity0 hit two exquisite lobs to turn it his way , the second of them clnching the set			2
@entity9 again came back at him from 2 - 4 down in the third , gaining his one break of serve , but @entity0 's response was exemplary and he skilfully conunter attacked at the end			1
now he has a massive test against @entity13 , and with @entity151 suddenly in the opposite corner he will know there is nobody better equipped on how to give inside information on how to beat him			2
@entity0 's girlfriend @entity155 takes her seat for one of the more comfortable afternoons of watching her boyfriend @entity160 celebrates wildly as @entity0 takes control of the match in blustery conditions in @entity26 in - form @entity0 has reached the semi-finals having dropped only one set in five matches , despite the challenging conditions @entity168 ( right ) of @entity38 pop band @entity169 was one of several famous faces in the crowd @entity0 towels down in between points as he dictates the tempo against his younger opponent @entity9 correctly appeals a line call during the second set but eventually loses the tie break @entity0 was afterwards reluctant to get into the subject of facing his former colleague @entity14 , with whom he split in late november , but it clearly a live issue : ' i do n't really want to talk about what @entity14 's strengths and weaknesses are			1
i 'm happy to talk about @entity13 and what his strengths and weaknesses are but i do n't want to discuss what @entity14 does well and does n't do well , ' he said			0
' i 'm not playing against him			0
i do n't think in loads of sports people talk about other players ' coaches and managers and whatnot			0
' we 'll see how the match plays out and what the tactics are			0
but i also know what @entity14 thinks of @entity13 's game because he 's told me , so it works both ways			2
i do n't know what it will be like , maybe i 'll find it weird on the day			0
my goal is n't to beat @entity14 , it 's to beat @entity13			2
' the @entity10 , who played a five setter against @entity212 in the previous round , looked drained towards the end of the match by contrast , @entity0 looked fitter than ever after an intense winter training regime @entity0 and @entity96 shake hands at the end of the match , which say control and tactics overcome power the @entity10 leaves the court to rapturous applause from home fans despite his defeat the double @entity228 winner signs autographs for fans as he leaves the after another impressive performance			0

@entity0 defeated @entity9 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 3 in the *quarter* - finals of the @entity6 in @entity26
the @entity38 no 1 was in dominant form despite overwhelming support for the 19 - year - old local *favourite*
