@entity9 , 25 , died by misadventure as a result of ' cocaine induced excited delirium ' , an inquest jury agreed , but also found that a catalogue of police failures may have contributed to his death			1
speaking after the inquest , mr @entity9 ’s mother , @entity27 , said she was ' disappointed ' by the verdict and said she still held the police responsible			1
the coroner listed a number of police failures , including : failures in police training , ' serious gaps ' in the knowledge of operational officers , lessons were not learned as it was the second death in a relatively short period of time after a person was arrested and they had not recognised @entity9 needed urgent medical attention			2
@entity46 said lessons had been learned and that a range of improvements had already been put into action			2
the inquest was told that mr @entity9 called police on august 22 last year after he believed somebody had pulled a gun on him			1
he then locked himself in his bedroom in @entity56 , @entity57 , and was restrained by police officers after a struggle			1
police officers said mr @entity9 threatened them with a hammer , which led them to incapacitate him with pepper spray			1
mrs @entity27 , who wept in court on hearing the jury ’s verdict , said : ' i ’m very disappointed , but we did n’t have much faith in getting a good result			0
he dialled 999 , he had n’t done anything wrong			0
he should have been left alone for us to deal with			0
it was an abandoned phone call , they should have just left and left @entity9 and he ’d be alive today			0
' mr @entity9 was arrested for alleged affray and taken by police van to a custody suite with his hands cuffed and his legs in restraints			1
footage taken from the police van and the custody office was shown to the inquest in which mr @entity9 , who was known as @entity91 , can be heard repeatedly saying ' please ' and ' sorry '			1
the footage shows mr @entity9 face down in the cell with his hands cuffed and his legs restrained - moments before police realised he was unwell			1
tributes : a man leaves flowers where mr @entity9 was arrested in august last year in @entity57 , @entity4 two police officers can be seen with their feet on his leg			1
the four - week inquest heard that mr @entity9 was a cocaine user who would occasionally ' binge ' on the drug , and had been taking it on the weekend prior to his arrest			1
he had also been warned by doctors about the adverse effects cocaine could have on his heart			0
the jury of eight women and one man at @entity113 , sitting at @entity114 , reached its verdict after more than two days of deliberations			0
reading their narrative verdict , @entity119 , the coroner for @entity4 , said : ' partying and his heart ’s susceptibility to cocaine probably contributed to the death			2
' the ' fear , flight and fight ' response caused during the arrest ' may have also contributed to the death ' , the jury found			0
message : a note left at the scene showed the level of feeling the in community after he died the jury also ruled that ' ineffective ' police training , procedural failures , failures to carry out a ' timely assessment ' and a lack of communication may have also contributed to the death			2
in a statement delivered through the family solicitor , @entity148 , mrs @entity27 added : ' we believe that if the police had not stormed into @entity9 ’s bedroom then he would still be alive			2
instead he died on the floor of @entity155 custody suite while handcuffed , face down and with police officers treading on his legs			2
' a spokeswoman for @entity46 said the constabulary has already acted on information from the findings after a review by the @entity163 into its processes , procedures and training			0
new systems include : improved training around the condition of excited delirium ; redesign of transport vans to improve the ability of drivers and escorting officers to monitor detainees ; an ongoing roll - out of the issue of “ long ” handcuff keys to assist in the speedy removal of handcuffs			0
deputy chief constable @entity182 expressed the ' sincere sorrow ' of the police that mr @entity9 died in their care			1
she added : ' we are fully committed to ensuring we very carefully consider the findings we have just heard and we will diligently put in place those further steps that will help safeguard all who are dealt with by the police			0
' @entity192 , co-director of campaign group @entity193 , said : ' this was a shocking death			0
yet again , another inquest into a death following use of force has found failures at an individual and senior management level , and those responsible must be held to account			0

@entity9 died of ' cocaine induced delirium ' but @entity46 may also have contributed to his death , inquest hears
he called police saying someone pulled a gun on him then locked himself in his room in @entity57
police said they had to restrain mr @entity9 after he threatened them with a hammer before using pepper spray on him
he later died after falling ill in custody
