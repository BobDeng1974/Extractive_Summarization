@entity1 - based criminals have mastered the ability to manufacture almost perfect bi-metallic coins , stoking fears the £ 2 coin is vulnerable to a new wave of forgeries			1
while the £ 1 coin remains heavily faked , the £ 2 has remained almost untouched because of the difficulty criminals have connecting the inner and outer pieces of the coin together			1
but a shipment of fake euro coins intercepted in @entity15 , @entity16 , three months ago , has revealed forgers are now producing bi-metallic coins in massive quantities			1
the seizure - the largest of its kind in the history of the @entity22 - is likely to cause concern among @entity25 investigators given its ramifications for the £ 2 coin			1
the comparison reveals most fake coins lack detail and the colouring of the originals a shipment of fake euro coins worth £ 390,000 was intercepted in @entity16 in september			1
pictured is a pile of euros during the legitimate production process a @entity25 investigator told the @entity54 counterfeiters had historically struggled to make convincing £ 2 coins			1
he said : ' you 've always been able to tell a fake by dropping it on a table - they rattle because the two bits have not been stuck together properly			0
' another investigator told the paper that the @entity1 to @entity16 counterfeit route was ' entirely feasible ' and it should ring alarms bells if @entity1 gangs were exporting to the country			0
@entity68 said the leader of the criminal group responsible for the influx of fake euro coins was thought to be operating from @entity73 , @entity1 , where he has links to a clandestine manufacturing facility and people to organise the shipping of the counterfeit money to @entity15 , @entity16			1
a spokesperson for the @entity80 said £ 2 coins have a large number of features that make them difficult to forge			1
' a bi-colour coin is much harder to counterfeit because replicating the two metal components , the inner and outer , is significantly more difficult than a single component coin			0
' forgers would also require a highly sophisticated press to produce bi-colour coins			0
' the coin detector mechanism of vending machines and self - service check outs can detect the two different metal components , in addition to the conductivity , thickness and diameter of the coin			0
' the addition of edge lettering is also very hard to counterfeit , and some circulating £ 2 coin designs also include a latent feature in their elements which is difficult to replicate			2
' ' on arrival in @entity16 , the coins are distributed throughout @entity111 by other members of the criminal group , led by the main suspect in @entity115 , who is a @entity117 national			2
' twelve people were arrested this month after an investigation was launched following september 's seizure			0
investigators said : ' from this first seizure , investigators realised that the criminal group had the capability to produce a vast quantity of good quality fake coins , as the criminals were using sophisticated manufacturing techniques , very similar to those used to produce authentic coins			0
' it was the largest such seizure in the history of the currency , and were so perfect they would work in vending machines across @entity111			2
@entity115 prosecutor @entity137 said : ' they were high - quality fakes produced at a clandestine @entity1 mint and ready to be put on the @entity16 market just before the @entity142 spending rush			0
' a spokesperson for the @entity80 said a recent @entity25 - wide survey unearthed only one fake £ 2 coin and it worked closely with @entity146 , the @entity147 and the cash - handling industry			2
' together we ensure that every effort is made to maximise opportunities to identify and withdraw counterfeit coins from circulation			0

@entity1 criminals have developed ability to forge perfect bi-metallic coins
a shipment of fake euro coins , similar to the £ 2 coin , seized in @entity15 , @entity16
it was the largest seizure of its kind in the history of the @entity111 currency
historically counterfeiters have been unable to make convincing £ 2 coins
this was *due* to difficultly connecting the separate pieces of metal together
