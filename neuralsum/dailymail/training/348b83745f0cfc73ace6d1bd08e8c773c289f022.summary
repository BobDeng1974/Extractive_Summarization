former @entity1 and @entity2 striker @entity0 insists the concept of ' burnout ' is a myth and believes @entity6 will think twice about complaining of tiredness after this week 's furore			1
teenage forward @entity6 has come under fire this week for telling @entity10 he felt tired ahead of @entity2 's @entity12 qualifying win over @entity13 , with the national boss subsequently dropping him from the starting line - up in @entity16 last sunday			1
that has sparked a public debate over whether one of the nation 's most promising talents needed a break just three months into the new campaign			0
@entity6 has been criticised for complaining of tiredness just two months into the season @entity6 was benched for @entity2 's euro 2016 qualifier in @entity13 after alerting boss @entity10 @entity0 can certainly relate to @entity6 's dilemma having broken into the senior @entity2 set - up himself as a teenager , yet the 34 - year - old insists he did not dare tell either his club or national manager he could do with a rest			1
' we 're surmising how he was feeling but i never felt like telling the manager i was tired because i never felt particularly that i needed a rest , ' said @entity0 , who was speaking at the @entity38 in @entity39 where he was being inducted into the @entity40			1
' i know people will say , ' well , we do n't want anyone having burnout '			0
but i 'll ask you now - can you name one player who has ever been burned out ? i do n't know of anyone			0
' @entity6 played 45 minutes against @entity47 before being withdrawn at the break the @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 striker was plagued with injuries throughout his illustrious career but does not attribute those problems to ' burnout '			1
@entity0 added : ' people will point the finger at me but i would just say i had muscle injuries because it was hereditary			2
' my dad played football for 15 years and he had loads of muscle injuries , my brothers were both older than me - they were real quick sprinters - and they both had muscle injuries and i had muscle injuries			2
' i do n't think it was anything to do with how much i played			0
i do n't know of any player that 's been burned out , but i might be wrong			0
' @entity0 has rubbished the idea that players can suffer from burnout @entity0 concedes that @entity75 , who was in charge at @entity77 for the bulk of his @entity1 career , would ask his players if they were fatigued but the response was always a unanimous ' no '			1
and @entity0 believes the fallout after @entity6 's comments were made public by @entity10 will make the player consider whether he wants to express his feelings in future			1
' it 's difficult to know what to make of @entity6 's individual case , ' @entity0 said			1
' i can only speak from experience of me being in that situation and we always used to have a bit of a joke at @entity1 because the manager @entity75 would always come around and ask everyone if they 're fine , if they 're tired			2
@entity0 was inducted to the @entity99 on thursday evening ' you 'd always be saying , ' no , no , no , i 'm totally fine ' because you did n't want to get rested			2
' but if @entity6 has asked to be rested because he felt tired than you 've got to commend him for that because that 's putting the team first or he could have injured himself			0
' and then on the flip side you think to yourself well maybe he was just being honest with the manager , thinking he was just a little more tired than he was but still wanting to play			0
' then all of a sudden he 's been put on the bench and he 's thinking i do n't think i 'll be so honest next time			0
