by @entity0 it has famously been said that when a man is tired of @entity4 , he is tired of life			1
and now an online walking tour has launched a map that charts the scientific history of the fascinating city - taking in the sites where the most revolutionary scientific experiments were conducted			0
the map covers five centuries of innovation , from alchemy to the exact site that the atomic bomb is thought to have been conceived			1
scroll down for interactive map discoveries mapped : the map covers five centuries of innovation , from alchemy in @entity23 , suburban @entity4 to the exact site that the atomic bomb is believed to have been conceived in @entity25 it was created by @entity28 - based @entity27 , using data from the @entity30			1
in around 1550 in @entity23 , @entity4 , the theological adviser to queen elizabeth i , @entity31 reportedly communicated with an angel			1
he also tried to create the @entity35 , dabbled with the occult and published a number of mathematical theories			0
@entity41 electricity pioneer @entity39 conducted many dangerous experiments at his lodgings in @entity44 on @entity45 near the @entity46			0
the map says that it was there that he designed a lightning rod to minimise damage to buildings including @entity52 , which earned him a @entity54 at the @entity55 in 1756			0
making medical history : at @entity58 on the @entity59 ( marked on the map left ) , renowned surgeon @entity57 ( pictured right ) manually closed off the aorta to prevent an aneurysm in 1817			2
while it was the first time the theory was put into practice , the patient dies just 40 hours after the operation at @entity58 on the @entity59 , renowned surgeon @entity57 manually closed off the aorta to prevent an aneurysm in 1817			1
he cut into a dying man 's abdomen without anaesthetic and found his aorta by feel alone , before tying it off in front of onlookers and saving the man 's life - albeit for just 40 hours			2
@entity80 in @entity4 was the setting for a couple of railway experiments			2
in 1840 brothers @entity84 and @entity86 rented half a mile of the unopened @entity87 and demonstrated the world 's first atmospheric railway , which used differential air pressure to provide power for propulsion			0
while the applications of the technology were short lived , their innovation preceded the opening of the @entity98 two decades later , which used steam locomotives			0
the site of an explosive idea : this peaceful park is the final stop of the walking tour			0
leafy @entity105 in @entity25 was where the bomb that has changed the nature of war forever , was conceived by @entity111 when he was crossing the street in 1933 full steam ahead : @entity80 in west @entity4 ( mapped ) was the setting for a couple of railway experiments and had one of the earliest @entity98 lines using steam locomotives in 1840 brothers @entity84 and @entity86 rented half a mile of the unopened @entity87 and demonstrated the world 's first atmospheric railway ( illustrated ) , which used differential air pressure to provide power for propulsion it was in a shed in @entity127 in @entity128 in 1823 that the ' father of the computer ' , @entity129 , invented his difference engine - a type of calculator			1
while the first one was never finished , his theory and the creation of the @entity131 mark 2 , led to the development of other early computers			0
the first television was demonstrated at 22 @entity140 , @entity141 when in 1926 @entity142 transmitted live images of his assistant and a ventriloquist ’s dummy to 50 people			0
one year later , he sent pictures between @entity4 and @entity149 by telephone cable			2
and on the final stop of the walking tour , the bomb that has changed the nature of war forever , was conceived by @entity111 when crossing the street in leafy @entity105 , @entity25 in 1933			1
the @entity158 mathematics prodigy came up with the idea of the atomic bomb and ' as he crossed the street , time cracked open before him and he saw a way to the future , death into the world and all our woes - the shape of things to come , ' his biographer , @entity161 wrote			1
it was in a shed in @entity127 in north west @entity4 , that the ' father of the computer ' @entity129 invented his @entity131 - a type of calculator			1
while the first one was never finished , his theory and the creation of the @entity131 @entity179 ( pictured ) , led to the development of other early computers			0

tour starts in @entity23 , west @entity4 where at mathematician ' communicated with an angel ' and ends in @entity25 and the atomic bomb
@entity30 includes discoveries by @entity189 , @entity129 and @entity57 , who performed a *grisly* operation on a man without anaesthetic
