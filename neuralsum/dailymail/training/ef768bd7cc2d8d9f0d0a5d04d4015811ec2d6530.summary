' a little soft ' : president @entity0 said he believed @entity1 had lost some of its ' competitive edge ' @entity0 claims the @entity1 had ' gotten a little soft ' in the last couple decades and needs to ' get back on track '			1
the president was talking about the state of the economy during an interview with a local tv station from @entity9 , @entity10 , when he made the comments			1
he told @entity14 ’s @entity13 : ' the way i think about it is , this is a great , great country that had gotten a little soft and we did n’t have that same competitive edge that we needed over the last couple of decades			1
' we need to get back on track			2
' mr. @entity0 has faced heavy criticism for his handling of the economy , and the current unemployment rate of 9.1 per cent is threatening his re-election bid			2
he acknowledged that with the current economic climate it is a particularly ' challenging ' time for young people			0
he said : ' even before the financial crisis hit , one of the reasons that i ran for president was that wages - incomes had flat - lined at the same time that costs were going up			1
' i think people felt that opportunities were becoming more constricted for the next generation			0
' ' and that ’s why making sure that we ’re revamping our education system , making sure we ’ve got world class infrastructure , investing in basic science , research and technology , making sure that we are moving manufacturing to the @entity1 , and that we are being tough with our trading partners , making sure that they ’re not taking advantage of us			1
the current national unemployment rate of 9.1 per cent is threatening the president 's re-election bid ' there are a lot of things we can do			1
' however the president said he still would n’t trade the position of the @entity1 with any country on earth			1
he explained : ' we still have the best universities , the best scientists , and best workers in the world ; we still have the most dynamic economic system in the world			0
so we just need to bring all those things together			0
' the president has been trying to gather support for his $ 447 billion jobs plan , which has faced stiff resistance from @entity79 , and some democrats , who say it would be paid for by ending a series of tax cuts			1
he criticized @entity10 governor @entity84 claiming it was a ' mistake ' to cancel a planned high - speed rail line linking @entity87 to @entity9			0
the @entity0 administration had offered $ 2 billion to @entity10 to help build the railway , as part of the president 's high - speed rail initiative			2
however governor @entity84 rejected the funds claiming the plan may not be viable and there was a strong likelihood of it going over budget but @entity0 said : ' @entity10 stood to make big gains and to create a lot of jobs down there … it was a mistake to turn that money down			0
with the ending of the @entity108 programme meaning many of @entity10 's @entity111 workers have lost their jobs , @entity0 said he remained committed to manned space flight			2

the president said he was committed to manned space flight and that there would be a ' huge amount ' invested in the area he said : ' even with the shuttle program suspended , what we 're trying to do is figure out how we can move as many of the folks - the engineers , the scientists , the technicians – into these new projects to develop that next stage of human space flight			2
' ' we 've said let 's emphasize human space flight			0
that 's part of what makes @entity1 great			1
' to do that we must take the time to transition , to develop technology , more effective rockets , making sure that as humans are in space longer , we figure out how to maintain environments for them			0
' there will be a huge amount invested in that area			0
