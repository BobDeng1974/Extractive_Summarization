research suggests that balling up the right hand and squeezing it tightly makes it easier to memorise lists clenching your fist could be enough to help you get a grip on your memory			1
research suggests that balling up the right hand and squeezing it tightly actually makes it easier to memorise lists			1
later , when it is time to retrieve the information , it is the left hand that should be clenched			0
it is thought the movements activate brain regions key to the storing and recall of memories			1
the @entity20 researchers suggest those who are short of a pen and paper should try the trick when attempting to commit a shopping list or phone number to memory			1
in the study , volunteers were given a rubber ball and asked to squeeze it as hard as possible before trying to memorise a list of 72 words			2
they squeezed the ball again a couple of minutes later , ahead of recollecting as many of the words as possible			0
one group used their right hand on both occasions , another their left			0
a third group clenched their right fist ahead of memorising and their left ahead of recall and a fourth did the reverse			0
a fifth group held the ball but did not squeeze it			0
those who squeezed with their right hand , followed by their left , remembered the most words			0
the next best were the volunteers who made a fist with their right hand both times , while those who did n’t squeeze at all did better than those who led with their left			0
it is thought that the movement of clenching the right fist activates a brain region that is involved in storing memories , while squeezing the left hand triggers an area that is key to retrieving information			1
lead researcher dr @entity61 said : ‘ the findings suggest that simple body movements – by temporarily changing the way the brain functions – can improve memory			2
’ more research is needed to see if other types of memory can be boosted – and if left - handers also benefit from the trick			2
