@entity7 said that the wonderwall singer will get fined again by a judge as he blamed his ' lack of focus ' for the failure to make a @entity13 said that @entity3 's divorce in @entity15 to @entity17 singer @entity16 had been ' far more taxing ' than his child custody battle in @entity5 , which was not apparently a priority			1
mr @entity7 spoke out after a stormy week in @entity3 's bitter maintenance battle with @entity2 journalist @entity21 over their daughter @entity22 , 21 months			1
her mother is involved in a bitter legal case over how much maintenance @entity34 should pay criticised : former @entity36 singer @entity3 was described as ' foolish ' by the lawyer for @entity21 if he failed to turn up again to a @entity5 court to give evidence over the maintenance dispute however that weekend he was seen walking hand in hand in @entity43 with his new girlfriend , @entity44			1
a judge fined mr @entity3 $ 5,000 and he will likely be reprimanded again if he fails to show up at his deposition next month said mr @entity7 , whose previous clients include @entity48 said : ' i assume he will come over			1
' the judge will sanction him again if he does n't come			0
to not come over would be foolish			0
' @entity7 said that he believed a deal was not far off and hoped it would emerge in the coming months			0
@entity53 are ' nitpicking issues ' like how the ensure @entity3 pays and what to do if he stops paying			0
the main problem however ' seems to be the accountants '			0
referring to @entity3 's divorce lawyer , @entity7 said : ' i think the cause is that everything is going through the accountants and @entity64 's office ' trying to explain why there was no deal with @entity3 , he said : ' it might be for want of a lack of a better word , a lack of focus			1
' if you have lengthy financial matters in if there 's a child support case it 's far more taxing than the child support issue which is basically coming to a number and how it 's going to be paid			1
' @entity3 , 42 , had @entity22 with @entity21 , 40 , in 2013 after she profiled him for the @entity80			1
since then the two have been slogging it out in the courts about child support			2

@entity3 is currently paying her $ 5,000 a month until a final decision about child maintenance can be agreed			1
arr said that unless a deal is reached then the monthly payment could be reviewed every three years , and mr @entity3 could end up being the loser			2
@entity5 child custody laws state that @entity3 could be forced to pay more if his income goes up by 15 per cent in that time , not to mention the inconvenience of regular renegotiation			1
@entity7 said : ' @entity3 's band [ @entity36 ] has disbanded			2
let 's say he and his brother work it out and get back together			0
' if they did do they would make a zillion dollars			0
when [ bands ] do n't perform in years and they go back on tour they make a fortune			0
' why would someone subject themselves to coming back [ to @entity5 ] every three years ? ' when you do an agreement it 's done			0
' @entity3 is currently fighting a war on two fronts as the financial arrangements from his divorce to ex-wife @entity16 , with whom he has a son , @entity125 , 13 , have not been resolved			0
until then his case against @entity21 can not be dealt with , he claims.gallagher also has a daughter @entity127 , 16 , and son @entity128 , 15 , from previous relationships			2

he said : ' mr @entity3 has been given every opportunity to do the right thing by my granddaughter			0
he has had plenty of time to do so voluntarily but unfortunately he 's failed			0
' instead , mr @entity3 's adviser continues to spread misinformation , blaming our side for the lack of settlement while knowing full well that they are the ones who are continually delaying			2

former @entity36 singer has a 21 - month - old daughter , @entity22 , with @entity2 journalist @entity21 , who is suing him over child support
@entity3 , who has three other children by three different women , has never seen daughter , conceived when he was being profiled for @entity80
@entity21 is suing him for child maintenance , currently set at $ 5,000 a month before settlement , but he has repeatedly failed to give evidence in @entity5
