by @entity0 published : 17:03 est , 13 october 2013 updated : 03:35 est , 14 october 2013 long ago , when i was a schoolboy , an older cousin showed me round his office and introduced me to a strange piece of apparatus that he said could photograph a document and send an instant reproduction anywhere in the world , as long as there was a similar machine to receive it			2
i was agog , especially when he demonstrated it , for the accompanying beeps and whirrs made its remarkable capabilities seem even more like wizardry			2
but yesterday i had a contraption delivered that makes the dear old fax machine look like something from the @entity20			2
price of progress : @entity0 poses with the expensive fruit of his labour it was a 3d printer , called a @entity26 , and its @entity28 manufacturers claim it can print anything from tools to teacups			1
not images , you understand , but actual objects			1
tools for the toolbox and teacups for the crockery cupboard			2
i imagined all kinds of things beamed before my eyes , as if from @entity43 ’s teleporter			2
could this be the most exciting invention ever ? the company , @entity45 , clearly thinks so , although it is understandably more reticent about the alarming , widely reported capacity of a 3d printer to produce fully functioning firearms			1
but i did n’t want to jump the gun			2
i did n’t want a gun at all			2
i wanted to start by printing something simple			2
if , that is , i could get the thing to work			2
i am not what you would call technologically adept			2
hooking up a £ 49.99 @entity58 printer takes me to the very limit of my technical know - how , and i have often have to call downstairs to my wife , @entity61 , who is much better at following diagrams			1
unlike me , she can assemble an @entity65 wardrobe in less than a fortnight			1
but do n’t get me wrong			2
i like gadgets , as long as someone else can make them work for me			0
more than once i ’ve used the red button on my telly			0
in motion : the cube can build plastic objects , like this fledgling chess piece , layer by layer and when i heard the cube was being launched in the @entity80 this month , following its successful introduction in the @entity28 earlier in the year , i knew i wanted one			1
after all , it ’s said that 3d printers could transform the way we live , enabling us to make , rather than buy , the things we need			1
the solid imaging process known as @entity89 — or stereolithography — was invented more than 25 years ago by a clever man called @entity92 , now in his mid- 70s			0
but it has taken until now to refine his @entity94 , titled ‘ @entity96 ’ , into a commercially viable product			0
my @entity98 cost £ 1,195 , which is n’t chicken - feed , but it ’s not much more than the price of a swanky laptop			1
gradual : the chess piece , built from a pre-loaded template , rose slowly but surely from the glass plate when i told my son @entity108 , 15 , there was a cube on the way , he was properly excited			1
and , as every parent of teenagers knows , you need a teenage boy onside whenever you ’re trying to do anything that involves software			0
you ’ll be pleased to hear that getting the @entity79 out of its box posed me no difficulties whatsoever			1
then i opened its manual			0
by page four , i was stumped			0
i had to recruit both teenage sons to help me activate my cube ‘ by entering your @entity79 ’s serial number in the designated bar under the @entity127 ’ — the sort of instruction that transports me back to the @entity131 ’ physics lessons which had me frozen in fear			1
@entity79 comes with ten pre-programmed designs , carried on a memory stick that slots into the back			1
write caption here from the options available , we chose to print a plastic fluorescent green teacup			1
not that we needed one — who does ? — but we thought it might be nice to have something from which we could toast our first successful 3d printing venture			1
there are 15 other colours of plastic to choose from			0
cartridges cost £ 52.80 each , and contain enough plastic to make 53 mobile phone covers — should you wish to			1
then came the grown - up bit : prepping the @entity79 for action			1
first , we had to load the cartridge			0
this is full of plastic resin , a fine filament of which is forced through a nozzle , heated up , then directed onto a glass plate below			0
success : @entity0 printed out two of the luminous chess pieces the process from there is effectively that of a high - tech potter ’s wheel , with layers of heated plastic building up and then cooling , until the object is complete			1
we did everything by the book , and then pressed the start button			0
with what my @entity173 , 18 , called ‘ @entity177 - y noises ’ , the @entity79 whirred into action			1
our teacup would be ready in three hours			0
but after 20 minutes of watching , engrossed , there came an unsettling ‘ tkkk , tkkk , tkkk ’ sound , and the horribly portentous words ‘ @entity183 ’ appeared on the little screen at the base			1
the operation had ‘ aborted ’			1
this happened three times , and while i ’m quite used to technology malfunctioning , the children were befuddled			0
‘ how , how , is it a filament flow fail ... how ? ’ lamented @entity173			0
‘ stop saying how ! ’ barked @entity108			0
‘ do n’t get shirty , ’ snapped @entity61 , getting shirty			0
after almost four hours , all that the @entity79 had produced was a family row			1
well , that and a disc of green plastic , the aborted base of a teacup			1
we needed external help , so i called customer service support			1
i was told someone would call back , and a little while later , someone did			0
not from @entity208 in nearby @entity209 — oh no ! — but from suite 400 in @entity211 , on the outskirts of @entity213 , @entity214 , no less			0
this was @entity216 , senior project manager with @entity217 , which operates @entity218			0
@entity216 assured me there were already cubes in every country in the world and he certainly did n’t think it odd to be ringing someone in north @entity224			0
@entity216 stayed on the phone for 83 minutes , resolving our difficulties in the sympathetic but authoritative manner of an air traffic controller explaining to a passenger , forced to take control after the collapse of the pilot , how to land a plane			1
intricate : the pieces have precise battlements and even a spiral staircase inside after a long consultation , he told us we probably had an issue with our @entity242			1
being @entity28 , he pronounced z as zee			1
‘ our c - gap ? ’ i asked him			0
‘ no , ’ he replied , in the kindly way of someone dealing with a small child , ‘ your @entity242			1
’ this , it transpired , is the name for the space between the nozzle of the print jet and the glass plate , or print pad , on which a circle of glue must first be smeared so the molten plastic @entity260 , @entity216 reckoned , was probably too small , inhibiting the filament flow			1
‘ ah , the filament flow , ’ i exclaimed			0
now that was something i knew about			0
it is funny , when dealing with technology , how words or phrases that were completely unknown to you a few hours earlier begin to take on the comforting familiarity of a relative ’s name			0
@entity61 , the boys and i had already been bandying ‘ filament flow ’ around as we might talk about @entity276 or cousin @entity277 , and now we started discussing our @entity278 as though it , too , were part of the family			1
we widened the setting , and with @entity216 still on the phone so he could check that the @entity177 - y noises were as they should be , we started the printing process again			0
this time , we decided to use another of the basic templates that the @entity79 offers : a chess piece			1
i have a handsome wooden chess set in conventional black and white that certainly does n’t need two vibrant green rooks , or castles			1
yet creating them was something that i urgently , profoundly wanted to do			0
contrast : however , the new additions to @entity0 's chess set were not exactly inconspicuous this time , mercifully , there was no failure of the filament flow			1
our z - gap was perfect			0
the rook rose slowly and noisily , yet rather majestically from the plate , a small domestic triumph which felt like a giant leap for mankind			2
i ’m suddenly struck by the horror that printing off a gun might not be that much more difficult an operation			0
a 25 - year - old @entity311 called @entity312 , who describes himself as a crypto - anarchist , has developed a 3d printable ‘ wiki weapon ’ , called @entity316			2
he posted instructions for making @entity316 online , and they were downloaded 100,000 times in two days , before the @entity319 had them removed			0
worryingly , metal detectors can not detect a plastic gun			0
to the alarm of security services all round the world , @entity323 tv reporters built the gun and tested it successfully using 9mm cartridges , then smuggled it into the country ’s parliament building , just to see if they could			0
pointless ? @entity0 's sons were not entirely convinced by the usefulness of their father 's latest purchase a more sophisticated printer than the @entity79 is required to do this , but the principle is just the same as my innocent chess pieces : layers of molten plastic building each of the components of a gun			1
i got back to the job in hand and watched my rookie rook growing			0
it took almost two hours to complete , but was a delightful little thing , with precise battlements and even a tiny spiral staircase inside			0
it has to be said they stand out on my chessboard like alien invaders			0
but one day we ’ll get round to printing the other pieces to keep them company			2
in the meantime , we ’re determined to print a whole teacup			2
but to get more sophisticated with our designs , we need to download @entity79 software , which is the only way we ’ll hold the interest of @entity173 , in whom the second rook seemed to awaken a certain cynicism			1
‘ it ’s good , ’ he said , ‘ but what ’s the point of just creating these things for the sake of it ? it ’s like a high - tech @entity377 press			2
’ i had 1,195 good reasons to disagree with him , but i could see his point .			2

@entity79 is now available for £ 1,195 and can ' print ' small objects
but the 3d printer proved tricky to assemble and prone to errors
83 minutes on the line to tech support in the @entity28 had the problem solved
the result was two green chess pieces and part of an ' aborted ' tea cup
