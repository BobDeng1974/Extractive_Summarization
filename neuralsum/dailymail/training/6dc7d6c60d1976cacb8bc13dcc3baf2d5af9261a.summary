a rare @entity1 butterfly called the continental swallowtail has succeeded in breeding in @entity4 for the first time a rare @entity1 butterfly has succeeded in breeding in @entity4 for the first time			1
the continental swallowtail - a large yellow and black butterfly with a long streamer - shaped tail - has been spotted 12 times in @entity13 in recent days			1
the butterfly is thought to have migrated from @entity14 during last summer ’s heatwave , when it was seen several times along the south coast			1
but wildlife experts are amazed the insect has managed to survive the winter , and even breed and produce young			2
@entity21 , of the @entity24 charity ’s @entity22 , has been monitoring the butterflies since they arrived last summer			2
he said : ‘ so far there have been 12 sightings of swallowtails in @entity13 this spring			1
‘ six of these have been seen to emerge from pupae we were monitoring , others have been seen in @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			0
‘ there are still more to emerge and no doubt many other swallowtails that we do n’t know about are roaming the country , so there has never been a more exciting to me to head out looking for butterflies			0
‘ this current invasion could be the start of the colonisation of @entity46 by the swallowtail			1
in 20 years this butterfly could be a regular visitor to our gardens			2
’ the @entity4 boasts its own subspecies of swallowtail - papilio machaon britannicus ( pictured as a caterpillar ) - which is @entity4 's largest native species but is smaller and darker than the continental butterfly sightings have been made in @entity32 ( marked at a ) , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 in @entity13			1
the @entity4 's own subspecies of swallowtail - papilio machaon britannicus - is smaller and darker than the continental butterfly , and typically found in the @entity58 ( marked at b ) the continental swallowtail , which has a wingspan of up to three and a half inches ( 9cm ) , is common across the warmer parts of @entity1 , but previously it was considered unable to survive @entity4 ’s cold winters			1
last summer ’s sightings were the first in the @entity4 since 1945			1
the hot weather , followed by an unusually mild winter and spring , may have provided the conditions suitable for breeding			0
the continental swallowtail ( pictured ) - a large yellow and black butterfly with a long streamer - shaped tail - has been spotted 12 times in @entity13 the @entity4 boasts its own subspecies of swallowtail - papilio machaon britannicus - which is @entity4 ’s largest native species , but is smaller and darker than the continental butterfly			1
it only lives in the @entity58 , where it feeds on milk parsley alone , a plant that is confined to the fenlands			1
its continental cousin - @entity84 machaon gorganus - is less fussy and can feed on related umbellifer plants , such as fennel , cow parsley , hogweed and the leaves of carrots			0
the emergence of the swallowtail is a welcome boost for butterfly conservationists , after a steady decline in the number of @entity4 butterflies			1
the loss of wildflower meadows , use of chemicals in farming and the growth of cities has meant the insects have struggled to survive			2
a string of damp and cool summers have also hit butterfly populations , which thrive in sunny and warm conditions			2
last year ’s hot weather was excellent for butterflies , with numbers up significantly compared to the washout summer of 2012 , according to the @entity4 @entity114			1
but despite the 2013 population boost , numbers last year were still only half of the population seen when the scheme started in 1976			0
@entity24 has asked that anyone who spots swallowtails in @entity46 send details to www.sussex-butterflies.org.uk			1
the @entity4 's subspecies of swallowtail only lives in the @entity58 ( pictured ) , where it feeds on milk parsley alone , a plant that is confined to the fenlands			1
however , its continental counterpart is a less fussy eater gritting the roads with salt increases wing power in butterflies and boosts their brain size , according to a study released earlier this week			0
research by @entity137 found male insects that fed on plants rich in sodium that had run off from nearby roads had bigger muscles - while the females had larger eyes			0
scientists claim that this suggests humans are having a previously unknown effect on wildlife			2
butterflies do not eat but suck up fluids containing nectar and other nutrients			0
they are particularly fond of salt , which is why they often land on people to feast on their sweat			0
now , researchers have found salt run - off from roads - such as when it is used to clear snow - altered development of their brain and flight muscles			0
they compared levels of sodium in grass , mustard , oak and milkweed growing in ditches within 16 feet ( five metres ) of a county road , and in prairies at least 330 feet ( 100 metres ) from a paved road in a nature reserve near @entity180			0
the roadside milkweed and oak had 1.5 to 30 times higher concentrations of sodium in its leaves , compared with those further away			2
when monarch butterflies ( pictured above ) were reared on roadside milkweed containing 16 times more salt , males had an increased amount of thoracic protein - an indicator for wing power that is crucial to the insects ’ migration			0
female monarchs had larger eyes relative to those reared on prairie milkweed , while cabbage white butterflies raised on an artificial diet with medium ( 3,000 parts per million ) or low ( 400 parts per million ) sodium levels showed developmental differences			0
males on the medium sodium diet had greater thoracic protein , whereas females had greater brain volume .			0

the large yellow and black butterfly has been spotted 12 times in @entity13
it 's thought to have migrated from @entity14 during last summer 's heatwave
current invasion could be the start of the colonisation of @entity46
@entity226 swallowtail is common across the warmer parts of @entity1 but it was previously thought it could *n't* survive @entity4 's cold winters
the @entity4 's subspecies of swallowtail is smaller , darker and lives in @entity58
