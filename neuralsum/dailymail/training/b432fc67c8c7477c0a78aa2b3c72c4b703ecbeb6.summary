by @entity0 concern : sir @entity2 has warned that the criminal justice system is not adapting quickly enough to cope with the impact of immigration more than half of all foreign criminals caught in the @entity7 have a right to stay that prevents them being deported , @entity7 ’s top police officer said yesterday			1
sir @entity2 warned that the criminal justice system is not adapting quickly enough to cope with the impact of immigration			1
a third of crimes in @entity19 are committed by foreign offenders , the @entity16 chief said			1
but the majority are @entity23 citizens who may have the freedom to travel between and live in all member states			2
sir @entity2 said police must do more to stop those banned from @entity7 getting in and to kick out those who should no longer be here			1
speaking at a conference on foreign offenders , he said : ‘ over the course of 12 months , approximately 80,000 foreign nationals will enter our custody suites			1
‘ a large proportion of them – in fact more than half – are from the @entity23 and have a right of entry and a right of abode			2
so any suggestion of deporting foreign nationals who we arrest is more complicated than it appears			1
’ police still struggle to obtain fast and accurate information on foreign suspects that have been arrested			1
they fear dangerous criminals and persistent offenders are slipping through the net as a result , he said			2
the @entity16 has been running a pilot scheme to bridge the information gap which has seen more than 2,000 migrants kicked out , at least 100 of them from @entity60 and @entity61			2
sir @entity2 said : ‘ we can not accept the risk of a foreign national wanted or suspected of serious crime , be it rape , robbery or murder , walking from our custody suite unidentified			1
the systems , partnerships and processes that we secure must provide not only accurate information and intelligence – but must do so at the speed with which we need them			0
’ earlier this year the government pledged that arrested foreign nationals – including @entity23 citizens – will face deportation even if they are not convicted of any crime			1
the crackdown will use a @entity84 law that states those wanting to remain here must be exercising their right to work or be self - sufficient			0
this could be used to tackle groups such as the capital ’s notorious @entity92 beggars , a group largely from @entity84 countries such as @entity61			0
in @entity19 , border guards have recently removed 44 @entity60 nationals , 64 @entity61 and two @entity97 , all either suspected offenders or criminals			1
a further 142 @entity23 nationals , or those with @entity23 rights , are being investigated with a view to removing them			2
a foreign criminal allowed to stay in the @entity7 despite a history of violent offences brutally assaulted a woman while his deportation case was being heard			2
@entity110 , 31 , was cleared of raping his victim who is in her 20s and can not be named			0
but the jury was unaware the @entity114 had admitted a three - month campaign of terror against her last autumn			0
judge @entity118 adjourned sentence for reports but told @entity110 : ‘ it must be obvious to you that you can expect nothing but a custodial sentence			0
’ @entity110 had been jailed three times for previous offences and had faced automatic deportation			0
but his lawyers successfully argued last august that his human rights would be violated if he was returned to @entity114 as he would be separated from his parents , who are also in @entity7 – even though he still has an extended family in his homeland			0
a relative of the victim criticised the decision to allow him to remain in the @entity7 , saying : ‘ if he had n’t been here he would n’t have been able to attack her			0
’ @entity110 , 31 , was cleared of raping his victim who is in her 20s and can not be named			0
but the jury was unaware the @entity114 had admitted a three - month campaign of terror against her last autumn			0

sir @entity2 says justice system is not adapting to immigration
a third of crimes in @entity19 are committed by foreign offenders
he added that 80,000 foreign nationals will enter custody suites next year
