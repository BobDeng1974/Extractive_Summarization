by @entity0 experts say ' exciting ' research on a drug to combat brain plaques could lead to a generally available pill within five years a new @entity7 ’s drug that could reduce a crucial component of the disease by 90 per cent is to be tested on thousands of patients			1
experts say ‘ exciting ’ research on a drug to combat brain plaques could lead to a generally available pill within five years			1
if the trials are successful , the drug would help around 400,000 - 500,000 @entity17 deemed at ‘ high risk ’ of developing @entity7 ’s because they have memory problems in late middle age			1
in patients with @entity7 ’s , clumps or plaques of a substance called amyloid beta protein stick to brain cells , leading to changes in memory , mood and behaviour			1
results from a previous three - month study of 200 patients , and earlier studies , show the drug reduces these amyloid plaques by up to 90 per cent			1
both healthy volunteers and @entity7 ’s patients took the drug without any serious side effects.the new trials will involve more than 3,000 patients in 21 countries , including the @entity17			1
the first 18 - month phase of the study will enrol 1,960 patients with mild to moderate @entity7 ’s , a group that already has significant plaque build - up			1
the second study , lasting two years , will be carried out on 1,500 patients who are at an earlier stage , with memory difficulties			2
dr @entity53 of @entity54 , one of the international team of researchers , said the drug – presently called @entity59 – is being developed as a pill so that it will be easy to take			2
‘ if the trials prove it works , it will have to go through licensing procedures , so it will probably take about five years to become available			2
‘ around 80 per cent of those developing @entity7 would be eligible , getting on for 400,000 to half a million people , ’ he said			1
the drug , known as a @entity70 inhibitor ( beta amyloid precursor protein site - @entity71 ) , is an enzyme that removes the sticky amyloid			2
the trials must show the anti-amyloid effect actually makes a difference to patients with the disease and prevents it from developing in those who merely have memory problems			2
there have been fears that amyloid might be a by - product of the disease rather than its cause			0
dr @entity53 , who is honorary consultant at the @entity89 , said the strategy adopted by this drug is completely new			0
he explained : ‘ the aim is to intervene before symptoms take hold			0
if the trials are successful , the drug would help around 400,000 - 500,000 @entity17 deemed at ' high risk ' of developing @entity7 's ‘ people with memory problems are n’t definitely going to get @entity7 ’s but there ’s a high likelihood it will affect two - thirds to three - quarters			1
‘ other @entity70 inhibitors have not got far in development			0
‘ stopping the formation of plaque early on , when the clumps are small and most toxic , is a fresh approach			0
‘ there is a great deal of excitement around this in the academic and medical community but there is a huge amount of work to do			0
’ @entity119 , head of research at the @entity121 , said : ‘ previous @entity70 inhibitors have failed at this hurdle before , though there are important differences between this latest drug and the one that entered previous trials			1
’ dr @entity129 , director of research at @entity130 , said : ‘ we know @entity7 ’s starts long before symptoms appear , and it ’s likely treatments will have more chance of success if given early , so it ’s positive to see this drug will be tested in people with early signs of the disease			1
‘ we await the results of these trials with great interest			0
’ a blow to the head knocking you out for an instant may be associated with @entity7 's , researchers say a blow to the head knocking you out for an instant may be associated with @entity7 ’s , researchers say			1
they found that older people who have been concussed , and also have memory and thinking problems , have a build - up of amyloid brain plaques linked with dementia			0
the study , published in the journal @entity161 , said plaque levels were 18 per cent higher in individuals who had at some point suffered a concussion resulting in at least a momentary loss of consciousness			0
this only applied to people who also had mild cognitive impairment , a minor age - related reduction of memory and thinking skills			0
the @entity175 researchers conducted brain scans on 448 people without memory problems and 141 with mild cognitive impairment			0
the participants , all aged 70 or older , were asked if they had ever suffered a brain injury that involved loss of consciousness or memory			0
study leader dr @entity184 , from the @entity185 in @entity186 , @entity187 , said : ‘ our results add merit to the idea that concussion and @entity7 may be related			2
’ but dr @entity192 , of @entity130 , said : ‘ it would be important to see this group followed up for a longer period to better understand the links between head injury and the disease			0

' exciting ' research could lead to generally available pill within five years
if trials are successful , drug would help around 400,000 - 500,000 @entity17 who are deemed at ' high risk ' of developing @entity7 's
