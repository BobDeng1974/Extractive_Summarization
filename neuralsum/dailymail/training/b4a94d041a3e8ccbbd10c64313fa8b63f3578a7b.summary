as the @entity3 siege unfolded in the @entity5 cafe , a @entity1 cameraman was watching it all through his camera lens and providing vital information and vision for police snipers			1
veteran cameraman @entity11 remained in the network 's newsroom as his colleagues were all evacuated around him			1
he was accompanied by a member of the force 's crack shooting squad , who asked him to keep filming as authorities assessed the movements of the crazed gunman and his treatment of the 18 hostages			1
usually , in any critical situation , the media would be ushered well away from the scene but this time the two worked hand in hand			0
what he saw and relayed back to the police command was as harrowing as it was stunning			2
in an interview with @entity1 , @entity11 said : ' one of the hardest things to see was there was three women forced to hold that flag up against the glass , and then another image of a poor guy in obvious distress with the muzzle of a shotgun , you know , in frame being pointed at his head			1
' ' it was the first time we 'd seen a clear threatening pose , that the gun was pointed at a bloke 's head who was in a very passive stance up against the glass			0
as the drama began to unfold , @entity11 had three cameras pointed across @entity75 into the @entity5 cafe , which would provide the closest possible , and clearest , view for authorities			1
' i knew we were getting something pretty remarkable in what we could see with our lens on the camera and the sniper concurred and then said could we stay there and keep sweeping and giving him continual information of what we were seeing behind the glass , ' @entity11 said			1

' the veteran news cameraman saw first hand , the manic behaviour inside the cafe by @entity36 , his mistreatment of those held captive and their sheer terror ' it was genuinely horrible , in 20 years , it 's very rare to come across such upsetting footage , there 's nothing you can do , ' @entity11 said ' the longer it went on , the lights went off , signs were n't looking good and the scene was sort of getting worse by the hour , ' said @entity11 who assisted police by capturing images inside the cafe throughout the ordeal ' the guys back in the police command were then asking for specific shots , so we put on @entity128 vests and came down and relocated cameras as they needed them to be			1
specifically , that window that they called " @entity132 " , where the flag was being sort of held up , was where the gunman was continually sort of positioning himself and putting hostages between himself and the window and himself and the door , " he said			0
he saw first hand , the manic stomping around the cafe by @entity36 , his mistreatment of those held captive and their sheer terror			0
' it was genuinely horrible , in 20 years , it 's very rare to come across such upsetting footage , there 's nothing you can do , ' @entity11 added			2
' for a real long time it was just him ( the sniper ) and i , i think for five or six hours , making small talk and , you know , to be honest , the situation kept us pretty busy because we were both looking for any opportunity that was going to affect a positive outcome , and then we continually were sort of blown away at just how sad the situation was as it went on and on , we both just were sort of praying that these families , these people were going to get out			2
' the longer it went on , the lights went off , signs were n't looking good and the scene was sort of getting worse by the hour			0
' for someone who has covered countless confronting news stories , this experience shook @entity11 like no other			2
' we continually saw him moving , almost shoving them , walking behind , really intimidating , angry kind of threatening manner , it was horrible to see			0
especially after those guys escaped he became quite agitated , ' he added			0
' we heard a shot , he confirmed " hostage down , window two "			0
six seconds later , we saw the special forces guys breach			0
it was ... it was pretty loud , pretty frightening , it 's like nothing i 've ever seen before , ever			0
' endless lines of mourners in the heart of @entity3 bring flowers to the makeshift shrine in @entity75 the floral tributes continue to pile up just a short distance from the ill - fated cafe in @entity3 's @entity191 chalk messages have been added to the tributes dotted around @entity3 's @entity75 for the 18 hostages taken and two killed during the @entity196 siege bouquets have been placed at the makeshift shrine by young and old and those of all backgrounds from @entity3 's diverse culture make - up			1

the veteran cameraman who was a police sniper 's eyes for the duration of the @entity3 siege for more than 16 hours
@entity11 was asked to stay behind by authorities as the rest of the @entity1 building was evacuated
his ability to zoom in on the cafe provided a harrowing but vital insight for police as they assessed the gunman 's moves
harrowing new images have *revealed* the tension and fear inside the cafe followed by the fire - fight
