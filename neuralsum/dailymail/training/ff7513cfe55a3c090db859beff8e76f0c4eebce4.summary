in the past decade , cases of the disease have increased by over 50 per cent			0
experts blame the rise on the explosion in package holidays by sun - seekers starting in the 1960s , as well as young people spending more time than ever before in pursuit of a tan that often leads to cancer - causing sunburn			0
the drug , which is also known as @entity47 , targets a specific type of melanoma which tests positive for the @entity51 mutation			1
this mutation causes skin cells to multiply more rapidly , speeding up the spread of skin cancer			2
@entity47 works by causing cancer cells with the mutation to die , which can slow or stop the growth of the cancer			2
the guidance says it should be made available for patients who tested positive for the mutation and whose cancer had spread or could not be completely removed by surgery			1
professor @entity62 , director for the @entity63 at @entity9 , said : ' for a long time , the treatments available for skin cancer which has spread have been very limited			1
' however , in recent years , a number of breakthrough treatments that can potentially significantly improve the prognosis for some people with malignant melanoma have become available			0
' @entity9 has already recommended vemurafenib and ipilimumab and we hope to add dabrafenib to the list of options available			2
' the information provided by @entity11 , who market the drug , suggested that dabrafenib works just as well as vemurafenib which also targets melanoma with the @entity51 mutation			1
' drugs like dabrafenib are also thought to have very rapid positive effect for patients , even in those who are very unwell or bed - ridden			2

he said : ' it 's great news that @entity8 has given the green light to use of dabrafenib on the @entity3			0
' its approval underlines the importance of a new generation of cancer drugs targeted at specific molecular features of tumours - drugs which after years of painstaking development are now making their way to patients			0
' the discovery of dabrafenib was underpinned by research done here at @entity91 , and its approval increases the treatment options available on the @entity3 for patients with metastatic melanoma			0
' cases of melanoma have increased by over 50 per cent in the past decade , with experts blaming the rise in package holidays in the 1960s as well as young people burning in their quest for a tan			0
