@entity0 announced the departure of their president @entity2 , marking the end of a glorious but faded era			0
in two spells , @entity5 won 19 world titles , the last of them the constructors ’ championship in 2008			1
but the wait for fresh glory — and the politics of @entity0 — cost him the job he carried off with conspicuous urbanity for 23 years			1
the 67 - year - old will officially leave with an eye - watering £ 23million pay - off on october 13 to be replaced by @entity19 chief executive @entity18 , who seems to have forced @entity5 ’s exit primarily because they disagreed over the direction of the business			1
for too long , @entity41 ’s consistent and fabulous driving has masked the essential limitations of their cars			0
this year ’s engine is deficient in comparison with that of @entity48			1
that was especially disappointing because the major change to hybrid power offered them a chance to turn the corner			0
poor results have led to flux within the team			0
@entity57 left as principal in april			0
his record was mixed rather than terrible			0
he led @entity0 to the last of @entity5 ’s titles			1
but , as @entity5 noted as long ago as 1992 , @entity0 carries with it ‘ the burden of false assumption , a public belief that we should win because we have so much money			1
’ on @entity57 ’s departure , high - flying @entity0 executive @entity68 was parachuted in from car sales in @entity71			1
the competent way he has gone about his work has belatedly answered some of the early doubts , but he is still a greenhorn			0
after @entity5 ’s departure was announced , @entity68 and @entity18 met at the team ’s @entity79 factory			1
afterwards , a spokesman dismissed the pair ’s combined lack of pit - lane experience , saying : ‘ there are many experienced people at @entity0 — the people here are our strength			0
‘ mr @entity18 ’s chairmanship has galvanised the clear , common objective to get back to the top			2
’ @entity35 supremo @entity94 paid tribute to one of his oldest friends and adversaries , saying : ‘ his leaving is , for me , the same as mr @entity101 dying			2
you see him , you see @entity0			0
you do n’t see anything else			0
you do n’t see @entity2			0
’ @entity2 congratulates @entity30 after winning for @entity0 at @entity29 in 2000 @entity2 talks with @entity106 during practice at the @entity109 racetrack in 2000 @entity2 and @entity19 ceo @entity110 celebrate at the @entity112 racetrack in 2003 how ? it is possible they will entice @entity115 , their legendary technical leader , out of a sabbatical - cum - retirement , but will he be willing to return to such a fierce glare while in his 60th year and with millions in the bank ? perhaps they do n’t need him			1
@entity68 , who talked before @entity5 ’s departure of needing to ‘ turn the page culturally ’ , is a big supporter of @entity122 , the 46 - year - old technical director , an @entity124 and putatively the new @entity125			1
next year @entity0 are likely to retain this season ’s driver line - up — a @entity126 in @entity41 and a @entity128 in @entity129			2
indeed , @entity41 is unlikely to be upset by the news after @entity5 upbraided him last year for making ‘ rash statements ’			1
some of @entity5 ’s theatrics looked hackneyed by the end and his semi-detached management style possibly acted as a brake on progress			2
but he undoubtedly fought hard for @entity0 since , as a 20 - something @entity138 aristocrat , he became a protégé of the ‘ @entity140 ’ @entity0			0
a law graduate , @entity5 began as @entity101 ’s assistant in 1973 , taking over as the @entity144 ’s manager the following year			1
in that stint , he won three constructors ’ titles and , through his signing of @entity149 , two drivers ’ championships			2
rescuers gather around the car of @entity0 's @entity41 who had to stop during the @entity156 @entity155 @entity0 team manager @entity32 ( right ) and technical director @entity115 watch @entity30 in 2001 @entity41 ( left ) looks on next to @entity2 after the third practice session of the @entity156 gp he took up various posts at the parent company @entity19 before organising @entity160			1
that @entity161 ran like clockwork , and so hard did @entity5 work that his weight plummeted from a slim 11st to a skeletal 8st			2
he was called back by @entity19 boss @entity165 in 1991 to shake up @entity0 , which was then shorn of success on the track and deep in debt off it			2
he produced huge profits and laid the groundwork for unprecedented @entity35 success by bringing in the perfectionist team boss @entity32 , @entity125 star designer @entity175 and , to cap it all , @entity30			2
more recently he formed @entity177 , the teams ’ association , which brought an end to @entity181 ’s reign as @entity183 president			0
after the meeting in @entity185 , he stood on @entity181 ’s office balcony at @entity187 , two friends and enemies of 40 years , looking down at where the revolutionary guillotine once stood			0
the coup , it seems , happened because @entity5 and @entity18 could not co-exist within @entity19 , which is soon to be floated on the stock exchange			1
last sunday ’s dismal result at the @entity156 @entity155 — two points — was the final cut for @entity0 ’s own @entity198 .			0

@entity5 won 19 titles in 23 years with the @entity201
he will be replaced by @entity19 chief executive @entity18
@entity204 will leave with a £ 23million pay - off
this year 's @entity35 car is again limited with a poorer engine than its peers
