@entity0 is facing years of freezing winters because of the dramatic decline in @entity4 sea ice , say scientists			1
global warming means autumn levels of sea ice have dropped by almost 30 per cent since 1979 - but this is likely to trigger more frequent cold snaps such as those that brought blizzards to the @entity0 earlier this month			2
and @entity4 sea ice could be to blame			1
cold facts : a reduction in @entity4 ice is being blamed for increasingly severe winters in the @entity16 dr @entity17 and colleagues studied the extensive retreat of the ice in the summer and its slow recovery focusing on the impacts of this phenomenon on weather in the @entity16			2
information about snow cover , sea level pressure , surface air temperature and humidity was used to generate model simulations for the years 1979 to 2010			0
the researchers say dramatic loss of ice may alter atmospheric circulation patterns and weaken the westerly winds that blow across the @entity36 from @entity37 to @entity38			0
@entity39 train station : scenes like this could become increasingly common in @entity0 this will encourage regular incursions of cold air from the @entity4 into @entity16 continents - increasing heavy snowfall in the @entity0			0
dr @entity17 said : ‘ the results of this study add to an increasing body of both observational and modeling evidence that indicates diminishing @entity4 sea ice plays a critical role in driving recent cold and snowy winters over large parts of @entity58 , @entity38 and east @entity59			1
’ while the @entity4 region has been warming strongly in recent decades there has been abnormally large snowfall in these areas			0
changes : a satellite image taken in september 2010 shows the level of ice extending around the @entity68 was the third lowest ever recorded			0
the image on the right from september 1979 shows a far greater ice coverage			0
the purple outline shows the median ice edge dr @entity17 , of @entity74 in @entity75 , said : ‘ here we demonstrate the decrease in autumn @entity4 sea ice area is linked to changes in the winter @entity16 atmospheric circulation			1
‘ this circulation change results in more frequent episodes of blocking patterns that lead to increased cold surges over large parts of northern continents			0
‘ moreover , the increase in atmospheric water vapour content in the @entity89 during late autumn and winter driven locally by the reduction of sea ice provides enhanced moisture sources , supporting increased heavy snowfall in @entity38 during early winter and the northeastern and midwestern @entity94 during winter			2
‘ we conclude the recent decline of @entity4 sea ice has played a critical role in recent cold and snowy winters			1
’ in november research showed there is less @entity4 sea ice now than there has been at any time in the last 1,450 years .			1

there is less @entity4 sea ice now than there has been at any time in the past 1,450 years
