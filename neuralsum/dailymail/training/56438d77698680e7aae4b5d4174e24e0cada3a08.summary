by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:28 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 17:30 est , 14 march 2013 @entity2 with @entity3 , head of the @entity4 , responsible for the death , disappearance and torture of tens of thousands of @entity8 in its so - called @entity9 pope @entity2 has been accused of turning his back on a family who lost five relatives to the military junta during @entity8 's @entity9			1
the @entity15 family appealed to the @entity17 leader in @entity18 for help when the relatives disappeared , including pregnant @entity21 who was kidnapped and killed in 1977			1
the leader urged then head of the @entity8 @entity23 and now @entity2 , @entity24 , to help them and in turn he appointed a monsignor , @entity27 , to investigate			1
after several months the monsignor passed a written note from a military colonel to the family informing them that @entity21 had given birth in captivity but the baby girl had been adopted			1
according to the family , the note allegedly said that the girl , who the family named @entity38 , had been given to a family that was ' too important ' for the adoption to be reversed			1
despite the existence of the note in a case he was said to be personally involved in , @entity24 testified in 2010 that he was unaware that any babies had been ' stolen ' until well after the end of the dictatorship			1
it is unclear whether the note was ever seen by the now @entity2			1
@entity48 , whose mother @entity49 co-founded the @entity51 in 1977 in hopes of identifying the stolen babies , said : ' @entity24 has a very cowardly attitude when it comes to something so terrible as the theft of babies			2
' he says he did n’t know anything about it until 1985			0
' he does n’t face this reality and it does n’t bother him			0
' the question is how to save his name , save himself			0
but he ca n’t keep these allegations from reaching the public			0
the people know how he is			0
' she told @entity69 newspaper @entity68 : ' the @entity70 has chosen a person who for us , families of the victims of repression exercised by the military , was complicit in a genocidal government			2
' the new @entity2 has already been accused in some quarters of failing to stand up to the junta with critics claiming that @entity2 did little to help those who disappeared when the country was under right - wing military rule – and too much to criticise the left - wing opponents of the generals			1
he has even been accused of turning a blind eye to the rounding up and torturing of his own @entity88 priests , something he strongly denies			1
accusations : human rights activist @entity91 has claimed that the @entity2 turned his back on her family when five of her relatives went missing during the @entity8 ' @entity9 ' ' disappeared ' : @entity96 who set up a campaign group to find babies ' stolen ' in the @entity9 lost her daughter @entity99 and her son in law @entity101 newly elected pope @entity2 appears on the balcony of @entity105 after being elected by the conclave of cardinals , at the @entity108 the family of a priest kidnapped and tortured with the alleged complicity of the new @entity2 also described his election as ' a black day ' in an emotional tweet			1
pope @entity2 has been accused of failing to prevent the five - month ordeal priests @entity116 and @entity117 underwent in 1976			1
the two priests were kidnapped and tortured at a military prison in @entity120 before being drugged , blindfolded and dumped in a field			1
@entity122 , an @entity8 journalist and relative of father @entity124 , described the election of @entity2 as ' a black day ' for her family in a tweet			1
ms @entity122 , who is married to father @entity124 's nephew , added : ' there is a family who have been waiting for 35 years for justice			2
today i spoke in their name			0
' the two priests were seized after being branded dissidents for their work with the poor in @entity120			2
investigative journalist @entity139 has published a book called @entity141 accusing @entity24 of being complicit in the kidnappings			0
it claims he withdrew support for the two priests ' work , effectively handing them over to the death squads			1
then and now : pope @entity2 as a young priest in @entity120 , left , and performing a mass as a @entity150 before becoming @entity2 , right father @entity124 died from natural causes in 2000 and father @entity117 has refused to speak about his ordeal since moving to a @entity154 monastery			1
but father @entity124 's brother @entity156 and sister @entity157 have both accused the new pope of failing to stop the torture			2
@entity156 said in a 2010 interview : ' as the person in charge he should have protected them from the rumours , from the false charges that ended with their illegal arrests			0
' @entity24 was called to give evidence at a 2010 hearing into the atrocities carried out at the military prison			2
he had reportedly refused to testify on two previous occasions , and lawyers said he was evasive while eventually giving his account			0
but he has since vigorously denied the accusations , describing them as ' an old slander '			0
he claims he instructed the two priests to give up their work in the slums for their own safety , and that he worked behind - the - scenes to ensure their release			1
he recently told @entity184 newspaper : ' i did what i could with the age and little influence i had			0
' @entity8 human rights lawyer @entity189 said that church leaders knew what was happening in the @entity9 , yet backed the regime			0
‘ the dictatorship could not have operated this way without this key support , ’ she said			2
@entity3 now commonly known as the @entity9 , or the @entity9 in @entity196 , the @entity197 saw the country under the rule of a harsh military junta between 1976 and 1983			1
after the death of the controversial president @entity205 in 1974 , his wife and vice president , @entity203 , took power			0
she was not very strong politically and a military junta led a coup against her and removed her from office			1
the junta maintained its grip on power by cracking down on anybody whom they believed was challenging their authority led for much of the period by @entity3 , the junta oversaw a period of state terrorism and counter guerrilla warfare which saw between 10,000 and 30,000 people killed or ' disappear '			2
many of them are said to have been taken to secret government detention centres where they were tortured and killed			0
the ' war ' was the junta 's attempt to quash leftist activists who called for a socialist government			2
among the most harrowing aspects of the so - called war was the disappearance of an estimated 500 babies			0
during the period , the @entity70 was largely seen to support the military led government			2
basic civil liberties were restored and a ban on political parties lifted after @entity8 lost the war with @entity241 over the @entity242 in 1982 and @entity244 's civilian government eventually took over in december 1983			0
but the new @entity2 is said by supporters to have worked regularly and at some danger to himself to curb the excesses of the military			1
they say that he does not speak out against the allegation because of his humility and the fact that he does not want to sink to his critics ' level			0
they claim that @entity2 took major risks to save so - called ' subversives ' during the 1976 - 1983 dictatorship , but never spoke about it publicly before his 2010 biography @entity17			1
in the book , @entity24 explained that he did n’t want to stoop to his critics ’ level - and then shared some of his stories			0
he said he once passed his @entity8 identity papers to a wanted man with a similar appearance , enabling him to escape over the border to @entity69 , and added that many times he sheltered people inside church properties before they were safely delivered into exile			0
under @entity24 ’s leadership , @entity8 ’s bishops also issued a collective apology in october 2012 for the church ’s failures to protect its flock during the dictatorship , but the statement blamed the era ’s violence in roughly equal measure on both the junta and its enemies			2
the period became a by - word for brutality , with thousands of families suffering the disappearance of loved ones and the adoption by the armed forces of murder methods such as throwing detainees out of aeroplanes			0
@entity299 critics point to @entity24 ’s refusal to give evidence in open court on the events of the 1970s until 2010 , when his answers were considered evasive by some .			0

the @entity15 family asked the @entity23 to help find missing relatives
a note is alleged to have claimed that a kidnapped relative gave birth
@entity2 accused of not standing up to junta during dictatorship
denies claims he turned blind eye to torturing of @entity88 priests
