@entity6 suffered terrible injuries in a motorbike accident 18 months ago , fracturing his skull and breaking both cheek bones , his jaw , eye socket and nose			1
after early operations the 29 - year - old still had a lopsided face and collapsed cheek – and feared he would never have the confidence to appear in public again			2
before : @entity6 sustained fractured cheek bones and eye sockets , while his upper jaw and skull were smashed after a motorbike accident after : he has now made surgical history after having his skull reconstructed by groundbreaking 3d technology in a world - first operation however surgeons were too worried to carry out any further procedures in case his eyesight was damaged			1
now revolutions in surgical technology have allowed them to reconstruct mr @entity6 ’s face with 3d - printed titanium implants – thought to be the first operation of its kind anywhere in the world			1
despite wearing a crash helmet , mr @entity6 , from @entity42 , spent four months in hospital after the accident			2
after preliminary operations , doctors at @entity46 , @entity47 , decided they had to break his cheekbones again before rebuilding his face			0
painstaking : the facial models , guides and implants which were all @entity54 printed by the team at @entity47 's @entity46 design engineers at @entity57 used ct scans to create and print a 3d plastic model of mr @entity6 ’s skull and the section of his cheek to be repaired			1
a series of @entity54 - printed cutting guides allowed the surgeons to accurately cut and reposition broken bones			2
in the final stage of the eight - hour operation , two printed titanium implants were slotted into mr @entity6 ’s broken eye socket and cheek , and the cutting guides were removed			1
pioneering : mr @entity6 's skull after the operation with temporary staples his surgeon said : ' @entity6 had a very complex injury and correcting it involved bones having to be re-cut into several fragments ' dr @entity81 , head of surgical design at the university ’s @entity83 for @entity85 , said : ‘ it was like solving a jigsaw puzzle			1
the pieces of bone had been displaced in the accident and had reset in the wrong place			0
the aim was to cut them apart and then pull them back into place			0
’ surgeon @entity96 says the 3d printing made the reconstruction far more accurate than previous methods			0
‘ the results are in a different league from anything we ’ve done before , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity6 had a very complex injury and correcting it involved bones having to be re-cut into several fragments			1
it made sense to plan it in three dimensions and that is why 3d printing came in , and successive 3d printing , because at every different stage we had a model			1
’ mr @entity6 's surgeon said he was pleased with the results of the operation , adding : ' @entity6 's eye is now a little bit raised , but that might settle over the next few months ' mr @entity6 , who worked in a bar before his accident , said his face is now almost back to normal			1
‘ it is totally life changing , ’ he said			0
‘ i could see the difference straight away the day i woke up from the surgery			0
’ mr @entity6 , who used a hat and glasses to mask his injuries before the operation , added : ‘ i ’m hoping i wo n’t have to disguise myself			2
i ’ll be able to do day - to - day things , go and see people , walk in the street			0
‘ it has just made me look a lot better			0
i take my hat off to them			0

@entity6 was involved in a motorbike crash in *september* 2012
he suffered two broken arms and a badly damaged right leg
he also sustained fractured cheek bones and eye sockets
his upper jaw and skull were also smashed in the crash
he has just had an eight - hour operation to repair his skull and face
*medics* scanned his face and used 3d printer to produce model of his head
this made it easier for them to plan the surgery and to repair his face
