by @entity0 last updated at 7:59 am on 30th september 2011 a rare white humpback whale calf has been spotted near @entity3 's @entity2			1
believed to be just a few weeks old , the 12ft calf was seen at @entity5 in the famous reef 's @entity7 area by a family out in the bay in their boat			2
white whales are highly unusual , with only 10 to 15 believed to exist among up to 15,000 living along @entity3 's east coast			1
a white spectacle : a rare pure white humpback whale has been spotted off the @entity2 in @entity3			1
there are only 10 to 15 in the 15,000 - strong humpback population along the east coast of @entity3 @entity21 was diving in the harbour when he spotted the animal surfacing and described the sighting as a ' once in a lifetime experience '			1
he said : ' we were just drifting when i noticed the smaller whale in the pod was white			0
i could n't believe my eyes			0
' then the white calf approached my boat , seeming to want to check us out			0
i was just so amazed at seeing this animal , it made me think how truly astounding the @entity2 is			0
' the calf 's parents may both have been dark humpbacks carrying a recessive white whale gene , but @entity2 official @entity40 said one may also have been white themselves			1
that raises speculation that the calf could be the offspring of famous white humpback @entity46			1
@entity46 - the name is an @entity50 word meaning ' whitefella ' - is the world 's best - known all - white humpback and has built up a loyal following in @entity3 since first being sighted in 1991			1
has he got a famous dad ? this picture shows @entity58 for ' whitefella ' - another pure white whale that been spotted off @entity3 since 1991			1
the calf may be related mr @entity40 said it was impossible to speculate on the baby humpback 's parentage without genetic tests to compare with samples taken from @entity46			0
' there is another couple of purely white whales and then there 's a very , very low number of animals that are a sort of blotchy colour , ' he said			2
' it is pretty unusual , but we 'd be purely speculating in terms of relationships to @entity46			0
' humpback whales are currently on their southern migration , and the baby will be feeding heavily from its mother as it lays down fat stores for the ' cold @entity87 waters '			2
its sex was unknown and mr @entity40 said there were no plans to give the young mammal a name of its own			0
@entity3 's @entity97 humpback population has been brought back from the brink of extinction following the halting of whaling in the early 1960s			2
@entity46 was last officially sighted by a cargo ship crew on august 10 around 6 miles north of @entity103 , in far north @entity104 , according to the @entity105 .			0

only 10 to 15 believed to exist among 15,000 humpback whales living along @entity3 's east coast
@entity111 's parents may both carry recessive white whale gene or could be offspring of two white whales
