just two days after an investigation revealed how much personal information public @entity2 networks can ‘ suck ’ from phones , a child has shown how easy the hotspots are to hack			1
a seven - year - old broke into a @entity9 in just 10 minutes and 54 seconds after watching an online video tutorial			1
the ethical hacking demo was carried out under the supervision of an online security expert to highlight just how vulnerable the networks are			1
it took the seven - year - old 11 minutes to infiltrate the network by setting up a rogue access point - frequently used by attackers to activate a ‘ man in the middle ’ attack , and begin eavesdropping on - or ‘ sniffing ’ - traffic experts predict that attacks on free , public @entity2 networks will rise in 2015			1
an investigation by 5 news earlier this week found that hackers can force customers in a café to switch their phones from a legitimate @entity2 to a fake one , without them knowing			1
this made it possible for thieves to access phones , hack email accounts , steal login details , track people 's movements and access online bank accounts			1
to put these dangers into perspective , virtual private network ( @entity46 ) provider @entity45 ( @entity48 ) recruited a child to attack a public network			1
@entity16 from @entity53 in @entity54 hacked a willing participant ’s laptop while they were connected to an open @entity2			1
sniffing / eavesdropping : the method of passively listening to data on the network without the users knowledge by tricking the network into passing all data through the hacker ’s computer first			2
man in the middle attack : a method used to intercept traffic between a user ’s device and the destination system , such as the café offering the @entity2 , making a victim ’s machine think the hacker ’s machine is the access point to the @entity79			1
@entity81 cache poisoning : a method of attack whereby ‘ updated ’ data is used to enable the hacker to divert the traffic to the hacker ’s destination of choice			1
@entity90 : wireless access points installed on a company ’s network without the company ’s knowledge			2
these access points override the legitimate network thereby allowing the hacker to perform a man in the middle attack and intercept data			2
unsecured @entity2 network : an unsecured @entity2 network is a wireless network that does n’t request the user to log into it via the use of a username and password			1
these are usually displayed as @entity112 networks			0
@entity113 - @entity113 : the first wireless security scheme developed , it was designed to provide security that was essentially equivalent to the privacy that was enjoyed in a wired environment			2
this is the least secure type of wireless network available			2
@entity121 - used @entity120 ( @entity120 ) : this protocol further improves the security of @entity113 without the need to buy new hardware			2
it still uses @entity113 for encryption , but it makes the attacks used to crack @entity113 a bit more difficult and time - consuming			2
@entity132 - @entity131 : this is the next level up from @entity121 and was designed for the home and small businesses			0
as the name implies , the new version uses a pre-shared key ( @entity131 )			0
this has become standard that is now used by most households today			0
@entity132 - @entity142 : this is a version of @entity132 used by businesses			0
it uses the @entity142 , or @entity142 , to encrypt data and is the most secure			0
it 's often coupled with a @entity149 server that is dedicated for authentication			0
@entity149 - @entity149 ( @entity149 ) : a networking protocol that provides centralised authentication , authorisation , and accounting management for users who connect and use a network service within a business			1
these users are authenticated against the company systems for added protection			0
channels : wireless networks use channels which are separated out so that various communication streams do n't interfere with each other			0
the 802.11 wireless standard allows for channels ranging from 1 thru 14			0
brute - force attack : a method in which a hacker will try and break the password by continuously attempting to log in with different credentials until they find one that works			0
it could take hours , days or months depending upon the complexity of the password being used			0
dictionary attack : a method used to ry and break the password of a user or wireless device by going through all the words in a dictionary , trying each one in turn until it finds a password which works			0
virtual private network ( @entity46 ) : a vpn is a way of using the public internet like a secure private network			1
it encrypts data and routes it through remote servers , keeping the activity and location private and secure			0
@entity90 are wireless access points , installed on a company ’s network without the company ’s knowledge			0
ms @entity16 began by searching for , and watching , a freely available video tutorial detailing how to hack a network - a @entity205 search returns over 11 million results , and @entity207 lists 14,000 tutorials ( pictured ) she began by searching for , and watching , a freely available video tutorial detailing how to hack a network - a @entity205 search returns over 11 million results , and @entity207 lists almost 14,000 tutorials			1
the schoolgirl then set up a @entity213 - frequently used by attackers to activate what is known as a ‘ man in the middle ’ attack , and began eavesdropping on , or ‘ sniffing ’ traffic			1
@entity90 are wireless access points , installed on a company ’s network without the company ’s knowledge			0
according to follow - up research , nearly two thirds ( 59 per cent ) of people regularly use unsecure , or ‘ open ’ @entity2 hotspots with one in five ( 20 per cent ) doing so weekly or more			1
among those who use these unsecured networks , 19 per cent log on to online banking and 31 per cent send emails and personal documents these access points override the legitimate network , allowing the hacker to launch an attack and intercept data			1
during this hack , ms @entity16 was effectively sitting between the legitimate @entity2 network and the customer ’s laptop , which is why it is dubbed a ‘ man in the middle ’ attack			1
ensure a network is genuine : check the name of the network with a shop worker			0
check the lock : secure websites display a green padlock symbol , also known as @entity252			0
make sure this is present when using a site that handles personal data and avoid accessing sensitive documents or pages using public @entity2			2
use a @entity46 ( @entity46 ) : not all sites display the @entity252 lock symbol , but a vpn will act as an intermediary between the device and the internet server			0
downloading an app ? check permissions : before installing , make sure apps ca n't access unnecessary information			0
for example , a drawing app should n't need a contacts list			0
forget the network : when leaving a publich network , do n’t just log off , ask the device to forget the network so it does n’t automatically log on when in range later			0
the experiment was overseen by independent online security expert @entity276			0
he is hired by companies to check the robustness of their network systems			0
‘ the results of this experiment are worrying but not entirely surprising , ’ said mr @entity276			2
‘ i know just how easily a layman can gain access to a stranger ’s device , and in an age where children are often more tech - literate than adults , hacking can literally be child ’s play			1
’ ‘ adults need to get their heads around online security basics - and stick to them whenever they connect to an unsecure network			1
‘ as for children , while it ’s admirable educators are focusing on skills like coding , it ’s important to teach them about the dangers that lurk online , as well instilling a clear sense of the ethics – just as we did with the child that participated in this experiment			1
‘ after all , as easily as one can now code a computer game , so one can fall into the dark world of hacking			2
’ a recent @entity314 report revealed more than half of people in the @entity317 have fallen victim to cybercriminals			0
according to follow - up research by @entity48 , nearly two thirds ( 59 per cent ) of people regularly use unsecure , or ‘ open ’ @entity2 hotspots with one in five ( 20 per cent ) doing so weekly or more			1
an investigation by 5 news earlier this week found that hackers can force customers in a café to switch their phones from a legitimate @entity2 to a fake one , without them knowing			2
this made is possible for thieves to access phones , hack emails , steal login details , track people 's movements and access bank accounts among those who use these unsecured networks , 19 per cent log on to online banking and 31 per cent send emails and personal documents			2
@entity345 - @entity344 , marketing director at @entity48 added : ‘ the image of cyber criminals hiding in a dark room in some far - flung part of the world is antiquated - they are just as likely to be sitting next to you in a coffee shop or public library			1
‘ and if a child can perform a basic hack on a @entity2 in minutes , imagine the damage a professional criminal hacker could do			1

experts predict a rise in criminals hacking ‘ free @entity2 ’ in 2015
to highlight the dangers , a virtual private network provider asked a seven - year - old to hack a network
the child watched an online tutorial before hacking into the @entity2 hotspot
it took her just 10 minutes and 54 seconds to infiltrate the network
