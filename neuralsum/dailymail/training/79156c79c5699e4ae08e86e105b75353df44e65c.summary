a @entity1 police officer has been charged in the death of a 95 - year - old @entity4 veteran who was shot repeatedly with a bean - bag gun at a nursing home last year			1
@entity8 police officer @entity7 , 43 , was charged last wednesday with a felony count of reckless conduct in the death of @entity12			1
@entity7 was released on his own recognizance monday after a brief hearing			2
according to a court document filed by the @entity18 prosecutors , @entity7 and other officers were called to @entity19 where @entity12 lived on july 26 , 2013 , after a staff member reported @entity21 was threatening other residents and was combative with emergency workers attempting to take him to the hospital			1
@entity39 reported @entity12 , who was about a week off his 96th birthday , had become belligerent and combative after refusing medical treatment for a urinary tract infection			1
when officers entered @entity21 's room they saw him holding a long metal object that they thought looked like a knife or machete			0
it was actually a metal shoe horn			0
a short time later , @entity12 grabbed a knife , according to prosecutors , and threatened to throw the knife at them and then ' cut ' them , refusing their orders to drop the knife			1
one officer fired a taser at @entity21 , but the prongs of the weapon did not strike @entity12 and when @entity21 , still holding the knife , moved toward the officers , prosecutors contend that @entity7 fired once with the bean - bag gun , paused and fired four more times			1
charged : prosecutors say @entity7 ( center ) was needlessly violent and did n't try to calm @entity12 before shooting him the @entity18 medical examiner 's office said @entity12 died of internal bleeding and blunt force trauma and ruled his death a homicide			1
in the court document , prosecutors criticized the officers for even entering the room the second time because @entity12 was alone and ' posed no threat to others ' , and said officers ' ignored ' other options , including leaving the room and trying to ' calm him down through the closed door '			1
all the shots , according to prosecutors , were fired from no more than eight feet away , far closer than what prosecutors said the ' optimum distance ' of 15 to 60 feet that are spelled out in training standards			0
@entity7 , prosecutors said in the document , failed to consider , as he was trained to , what effects firing the bean bags at close range at a 95 - year - old man might have			1
scene : @entity12 was shot at @entity91 , an assisted living facility in @entity1 ( pictured ) in a statement , @entity18 state 's attorney @entity95 , while acknowledging the difficult job that police officers have , said that in light of the ' other viable options to resolve this matter and the number of shots fired at this senior citizen at close range in rapid succession , we believe this officer 's conduct to be reckless '			1
@entity7 's attorney did not immediately return a call for comment			2
@entity111 , an attorney representing @entity12 's family , said no decision has been made about whether to file a lawsuit , but suggested the family has a strong case against @entity7 and the other officers involved			2
' i do n't understand how anybody could say they could n't have done anything they considered less lethal to a man 11 days shy of his 96th birthday sitting in his nursing home room , ' he said			2
@entity8 police , who have said the officers acted as they did because they had no choice , did not immediately return a call for comment			0
