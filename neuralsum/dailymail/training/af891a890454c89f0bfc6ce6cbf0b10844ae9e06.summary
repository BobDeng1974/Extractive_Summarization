families will be forced to pay tax on jewellery and other heirlooms under controversial new plans drawn up by the @entity5			1
under the scheme , tax inspectors would get unprecedented new powers to go into homes and value rings , necklaces , paintings , furniture and other family treasures			1
householders would be forced to pay a new ‘ wealth ’ levy on the assets – with the threat of fines for those who refused to let snoops value their possessions			0
a policy document seen by @entity24 spells out how the taxman ‘ may have to visit homes to test values of jewellery , paintings , etc ’			0
controversial : @entity5 plans to tax all assets including jewellery formed part of a policy document commissioned by the party 's @entity34 , which includes @entity36 - pictured at home with wife @entity38 last night , @entity5 mp @entity39 said that the jewellery tax was ‘ an interesting idea ’			1
another plan to extend the proposed mansion tax to include those with ‘ buy to let ’ and holiday homes is also being considered by @entity36 ’s party			1
both the @entity5 and @entity47 are already committed to introducing a mansion tax on individual properties worth over £ 2 million			1
however , the document reveals the deputy prime minister ’s party is now looking to go much further and levy the tax if anyone ’s total property holdings are worth more than £ 2 million			0
that would mean those who had invested in buy - to - let flats or a holiday home could be caught by the tax , even if none of those properties was worth over £ 2 million on their own			0
last night , both the jewellery and mansion tax moves were condemned by the @entity5 ’ @entity67 partners as ‘ the politics of envy at their worst ’			1
the plans come in a policy document drawn up by party tax experts – including ms @entity39 and key @entity36 ally @entity73 – as groundwork for the @entity5 ’ next @entity76 manifesto			1
commissioned by the party ’s @entity34 , which includes mr @entity36 and other senior @entity5 , the report makes clear the party ’s determination to force the better - off to pay more tax			1
it lists , among a catalogue of proposals , a new ‘ net wealth tax ’ on personal assets , which would require taxpayers ‘ to self - assess their net worth ’ – which could then be checked by inspectors			0
plot : under the scheme , tax inspectors would get unprecedented powers to go into homes and value rings , necklaces , paintings , furniture and other family treasures the report says : ‘ @entity102 , in policing the system , may have to visit homes to test whether asset values of jewellery , paintings etc , were correct			1
’ @entity102 last night confirmed that they currently had no routine powers to enter people ’s homes , with tax inspectors needing a court order for that level of access			1
the document , to be discussed at next month ’s @entity5 conference , gives no details on what the rates would be for the wealth tax			0
a similar scheme is already in place in @entity121 , with the levy paid on all ‘ global assets ’ including cars , jewellery and investments – with @entity121 tax inspectors having the right to enter homes			1
after his election last year , new @entity131 president @entity130 more than doubled the main wealth tax rate from 0.25 per cent to 0.55 per cent for anyone with a ‘ global fortune ’ of between £ 690,000 and £ 1.1 million			0
the @entity5 blueprint also set out plans to expand the scope of the proposed mansion tax to cover an entire property portfolio , as an alternative to the ‘ jewellery ’ tax			1
the document said : ‘ if successfully designed , this would ensure taxpayers with multiple properties would be liable for the mansion tax on the cumulative value of their holding above £ 2 million			2
’ one senior party member last night said the so - called ‘ mansion tax - plus ’ would be hugely popular among party activists in their @entity154 heartland , where people resent well - off outsiders buying up second homes and putting up property prices for local residents			1
but tax experts forecast that the change would end up bringing many more people into the mansion tax net			2
@entity165 , tax director at accountants @entity167 , said : ‘ a hell of a lot more people would be caught by a cumulative mansion tax			2
’ he also condemned the proposal to extend the mansion tax as a ‘ double taxation ’ on owners of buy - to - let properties , who already pay tax on the rent they receive			1
revealed : how the @entity24 broke plans to target the wealthy last year			0
tories have warned that a @entity184 ' jewellery ' tax would end up driving wealth out of the country in a further move , the @entity5 are also looking to boost the income from inheritance tax by changing the current gift exemption rules			0
currently , any items given away in the seven years before death are subject to inheritance tax but the party wants to extend that to 15 years			2
separately , @entity47 confirmed that it would force a vote in the @entity197 to bring in a mansion tax and appealed to @entity5 mps to join them in forcing the measure through against @entity67 opposition			2
last night , the @entity5 tax agenda met with a scathing response from the @entity181 who warned that a @entity206 ‘ jewellery ’ tax would end up driving wealth out of the country			0
and the revised mansion tax scheme was condemned as a ‘ direct attack ’ on people investing for their retirement			2
@entity215 mp @entity214 said : ‘ this is the politics of envy at its worst			0
not content with taxing people ’s homes , the @entity5 want to send tax inspectors to root through possessions – from your car to your jewellery			1
this is invasive , it ’s punitive and it ’s anti-aspiration – and people wo n’t stand for it			0
’ a @entity5 spokesman last night said the tax ideas would be discussed by the party , but insisted they were not yet approved policy			2
he said : ‘ this consultation is part of the process of asking for ideas on how to ensure a fairer tax system			0
‘ it is up to @entity5 party members as to whether these eventually become party policy			0
’ privately , one party insider said the @entity5 would be ‘ mad ’ to go with the @entity121 - style wealth tax			2
last night , an opinion poll showed @entity47 maintained a five point lead over the @entity181 during the past month			0
the @entity249 survey put @entity47 on 36 per cent , @entity181 31 , @entity250 14 and @entity5 down three points on just eight .			0
