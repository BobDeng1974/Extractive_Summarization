relative to millions : @entity2 warlord @entity1 hundreds of millions of people are descended to tyrants and despots , according to a study			1
@entity7 , an evolutionary anthropologist from @entity8 , has discovered that rulers such as @entity1 , @entity10 and @entity11 , the 6th - century sui dynasty emperor systematically impregnated women , the latter fathering around 100,000 babies			1
it means that there are millions of people alive today with genetic traits associated with seeking power and oppressing people			2
@entity7 explains that mass impregnations began around eight to nine thousand years ago when emperors and elites took over from hunter - gatherers			2
@entity7 told @entity24 : ‘ in evolutionary terms this period of human existence created an enormous selective pressure , with the guys at the top who had the least desirable traits passing on their genes to huge numbers of offspring			2
’ her research covered the rulers of the first six great civilisations - @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 – but it was in @entity41 that mass impregnations was carried out the most systematically			0

and @entity10 , who ruled @entity39 3,200 years ago , fathered 200 children			0
some @entity65 lords also passed on their genes in a similar manner , with some having sex with hundreds of serfs , according to @entity7			0
