by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail @entity1 insists @entity2 can challenge the sprinting powerhouses of @entity4 and the @entity5 and win 4x100metre gold on the global stage			1
the men 's sprint relay team has struggled to get the baton round in recent championships , but the @entity14 women 's quartet won world bronze last year and @entity16 believes the exciting crop of current talent is capable of achieving even more			0
upbeat : @entity1 believes @entity2 can challenge @entity4 and the @entity5 the 20 - year - old , one of nine @entity14 men to have dipped under 10.2secs for 100m already this season , said : ' everyone in @entity14 sprinting is running ridiculously quick at the moment			1
' if we get the four fastest guys in there with good hand - offs i do n't see any reason why we ca n't challenge the @entity4 and the @entity5 for a gold medal at the future championships			1
' the @entity4 have @entity35 and @entity36 , and the @entity5 have @entity37 , but i think we can do it			2
' @entity39 : @entity35 's @entity4 and the @entity5 are sprinting powerhouses @entity1 , who will run in the relay at this weekend 's @entity42 in @entity43 , also revealed he plans to contest only the 200m at the @entity46 's @entity14 championships from june 27 to 29			1
the 100m promises to be one of the highlights of the weekend , with the likes of sub- 10 men @entity52 and @entity53 and world 60m indoor @entity55 vying for just three spots for august 's @entity45 , but @entity1 said he is likely to concentrate on the longer sprint			2
he said : ' at the trials and @entity60 i 'll probably do the 200m as i 'm already selected for the 100m at the @entity63			0
it 's a long season as there are only eight days between the @entity66 and @entity67			0
if there was only championship i may have gone to double up			0
