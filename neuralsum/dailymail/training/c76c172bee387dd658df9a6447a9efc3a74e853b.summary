by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter a family lifted from a disabled sailboat hundreds of miles off the @entity6 coast with their sick 1 - year - old thanked rescuers and defended their ' maritime life ' in their first public comments since returning to land			1
@entity13 and @entity14 said in a blog posting that their children have been sailing on boats for a long time and that the ' modern cruising family ' dates back several decades			1
the @entity21 were on a round - the - world cruise with their 3 - and 1 - year - old daughters when the vomiting , feverish younger girl forced them to call for help			1
without elaborating , they said there were many inaccuracies reported in the news media about their daughter 's health , their vessel 's condition and the ' overall maritime situation			0
' @entity54 , the 36 - foot sailboat that had been their home for seven years , is at the bottom of the ocean 900 miles off @entity6 , sunk by rescuers because it was taking on water after losing its steering and most of its communications			1
' we have been happy with the maritime life we have been able to share with our daughters			0
even as we write this , several other boats are crossing the same stretch of water that @entity54 was on , with families who seek to show their children the world , ' the couple wrote in a posting dated thursday and titled , ' twenty four hours back in @entity40			2
' the couple thanked the @entity76 of the @entity77 and the crew aboard the @entity79 , saying , ' we will remember them forever			2
' in response to unsolicited offers of support , they asked that donations be sent instead to that others may live foundation , a nonprofit group that assists families of @entity90 rescuers who die on duty			0
sailors from the frigate @entity32 assist in the rescue of the @entity14 family with a sick infant on the ship 's small boat a satellite phone ping from the sailboat on april 3 set off a huge rescue effort that involved skydiving @entity102 , three federal agencies , a plane , a frigate and scores of personnel			1
when the family and their rescuers returned to @entity112 on wednesday , sailors said poor visibility , winds of 10 knots and rough seas kept them from sending a rescue boat to the @entity118 for hours			1
when they reached the family 's sailboat , 5 - to 8 - foot waves forced them to offload one person at a time			1
the effort took two hours			0
the ocean rescue set off a serious debate over parenting , and the propriety of hitting the high seas with two kids young enough to be in diapers			0
in a photo released by the @entity31 , the family looked like typical vacationers , with father @entity13 dressed in shorts and a baseball cap while lugging bags , and his wife , @entity139 , walking behind him , holding the toddler in a strap - on carrier and grasping the hand of her 3 - year - old daughter			1
the happy scene was a far cry from the miserable conditions described by @entity31 sailors who spoke to reporters after the ship moved to the @entity40 mainland later in the day without the @entity21			2
the @entity54 sailboat , carrying the @entity14 family , became the site of a @entity31 rescue sunday it was scheduled to move on to the @entity40 mainland later in the day but without the @entity21 , who said they want to tend to their 1 - year - old daughter , @entity38 , first and get some rest before talking publicly , @entity14 's sister , @entity154 , said			1
the @entity21 ' decision to sail around the world with @entity38 and her 3 - year - old sister @entity39 drew accusations of reckless foolishness from some observers and praise from others for their courageous spirit			1
' they 'll probably go on the ' today ' show to talk about this , and write a book about it , do a miniseries and get 15 minutes of fame because that 's how our country tends to reward people who choose recklessly to put themselves and their children in danger , ' said @entity178 , a @entity40 novelist who has three children			2
@entity180 does n't question the decision of her sister 's family			2
she said sailing is their passion			0
it 's what defines them			0
' @entity139 and @entity13 raise their children how they see fit , ' @entity154 said			2
' they are very concerned about child safety			2
that 's their no. 1 concern , and they did not do this blindly			0
they are responsible , good parents			0
' but they are aware of the criticism			0
@entity200 , a @entity202 - licensed captain , and his wife sent a statement from the ship defending their actions , saying ' when we departed on this journey more than a year ago , we were then and remain today confident that we prepared as well as any sailing crew could			1
' others said children benefit in many intangible ways from parents who show them the world , even when they 're too young to remember it			0
@entity218 said the @entity21 should be commended			0
' i think it 's a great thing , their decision to sail around the world , and just because their children are 1 and 3 years old does n't mean they ca n't be on a boat , ' said @entity225 , of @entity40 , who is also planning a world trip with his wife and two daughters , 8 and 10			1
' it 's just too bad what happened , but that 's also life			0
anything can happen , anywhere			0
' four @entity77 members parachuted to the sailboat thursday and stabilized @entity38 , who responded well to medication for @entity240 - like symptoms until the warship arrived sunday			1
she had previously had salmonella in @entity6 , where the family had stopped their voyage for her birth , but her pediatrician assured them she was recovered and could travel , @entity154 said			1
but shortly into the trip , the child started showing symptoms and did not respond to antibiotics .			0

@entity139 and @entity200 deny they put their 1 - year - old girl @entity38 in danger by taking her on their round - the - world trip
@entity32 was sent in to help airlift @entity38 to safety after she fell ill hundreds of miles off the coast of @entity6
sailors helped the family onto an *inflatable* raft and then took them aboard the warship around 8 am local time sunday
@entity38 is now recovering nicely . family believe she had a *relapse* of salmonella *poisoning*
