by @entity0 published : 03:34 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 03:34 est , 20 august 2013 toddler diarrhoea is a common cause of chronic diarrhoea in children aged between one and five when her two - year - old son , @entity6 , developed diarrhoea , @entity5 assumed it was a stomach bug			1
@entity6 seemed perfectly well and ate normally , but the problem did n't improve			1
so four weeks later she took him to the gp and received a diagnosis she 'd never heard of - toddler diarrhoea ( @entity1 )			1
this is a common cause of chronic diarrhoea in children aged between one and five , but unlike the type caused by a stomach bug , which tends to last for a few days , it lasts for months or even years			1
' the gp was confident @entity6 had it , but we were sent for tests to be sure there was no other cause , such as an allergy , ' says @entity5 , 36 , a web designer from @entity25			1
' but the results all came back clear and we were told that he would eventually grow out of @entity1			1
' the condition usually starts around the age of one and resolves itself around the age of four , never to be seen again			0
' it 's extremely common , ' says dr @entity35 , a consultant paediatric gastroenterologist at @entity36 and @entity25 's @entity37			0
' i see children with it almost every week			0
' after taking a thorough clinical history , it is usually obvious when @entity1 is the cause because , despite having several episodes of diarrhoea a day , the child is otherwise completely well and growing normally			1
' that 's the defining symptom			0
most nutrients are absorbed in the top 10 per cent of the gut , so they still get enough			0
many parents come along concerned that it 's caused by an allergy or intolerance			0
occasionally , i see parents who have tried eliminating numerous food groups unsupervised , which is not advisable because it can make a child ill. ' if there is a history of being atopic ( having allergies ) in the family or the child has recently had a bout of gastroenteritis , we 'd rule out things such as dairy allergy or intolerance with a two - to four - week elimination diet , followed by reintroducing these foods			1
' if it 's a food allergy , though , there tends to be blood and mucus in the stools , and this is not present in toddler diarrhoea			1
' another possible cause is coeliac disease - where the body reacts to gluten , a protein found in wheat			1
' if this is suspected , we can do a blood test for that , ' dr @entity35 says			0
while there is no drug treatment for toddler diarrhoea , dietary changes can help			1
' the first change is to cut out fruit juices , especially clear apple juice , ' says @entity94 , a paediatric dietitian			0
this is hugely popular with children , but , in fact , it 's one of the main culprits in toddler diarrhoea			1
the problem is the fructose it contains , which is poorly absorbed by some children			0
cutting down on fructose and increasing fat in your toddler 's diet could help alleviate symptoms ' if a sugar is not absorbed properly in the upper gut , it goes through to the large bowel unchanged , ' says dr @entity35			0
' the bacteria there then digest it and it ferments , causing gas and diarrhoea			1
for unknown reasons , some toddlers have a lower threshold of tolerating fructose than others			0
' a second and often effective change is to increase the level of fats in your child 's diet			0
' this may seem at odds with advice on combating obesity , but fats can slow gut transit time and ease diarrhoea , ' says ms more			2
' of course , we 're not talking about extra biscuits and doughnuts , but foods such as full - fat yoghurt , whole milk , cheese and a little more cream , butter and oil			2
' also it can help to reduce the amount of fibre in the diet , as it may be making gut transit time faster			0
' do n't cut it out altogether , but limit it , and keep an eye out for fibrous foods that make the diarrhoea worse , ' says ms more			1
' this can differ according to the child			0
for example , grapes and dried fruit might be fine for one child , but bother another			0
' all of these dietary changes can have an impact , but not always			0
children do eventually grow out of toddler diarrhoea , ' which is probably due to the gut maturing with age ' , says dr @entity35			2
he says children with toddler diarrhoea should never be given anti-diarrhoea medicines such as loperamide - which is found in many over-the - counter remedies			1
on the whole , children are not distressed by the condition , as it does n't usually cause any pain			2
' it 's more often the parents who are suffering because of its social impact and the increased laundry , ' says ms more			0
' having constantly to change clothes and deal with diarrhoea accidents can be very stressful			2
' @entity5 also found that sending her child to nursery was a battle			1
' the nursery 's handbook says that a child has to stay away for 24 hours after a bout of diarrhoea , so they kept ringing me at work to come and collect him every time he had an accident			2
' i tried to explain that he did n't have anything infectious , but it took a letter from the gp for them finally to understand			1
' it 's not pleasant for them to have to change him when he ca n't make it to the loo in time , but there 's nothing we can do until he grows out of it			2
' @entity222 's children , @entity223 , four , and @entity224 , 22 months , have the condition			0
' our gp referred us to an allergy specialist when @entity223 started having chronic diarrhoea at ten months , ' says the 31 - year - old financial adviser from @entity230			1
' there is a history of allergy in our family , so we tried cutting out foods such as dairy , but it did n't make any difference			2
' we were n't given any other advice apart from that , so we 've just soldiered on			2
' but like all children with toddler diarrhoea , the boys are strapping and healthy			2
' they 're huge and growing well and they do n't know any different so they 're quite happy ! ' says @entity222			2
' it 's not so bad now that @entity223 is toilet - trained			0
i think he is starting to grow out of it			0
' dr @entity35 adds : the most important thing to remember is that if you think your child has toddler diarrhoea , do n't be tempted to cut foods out of their diet without specialist help			1
' food groups such as dairy are vital for a child 's growth and health			0
' if the suggested dietary changes - cutting out fruit juice and increasing fats - do n't make a difference , i 'm afraid it 's a case of sit tight and wait for them to grow out of the condition			1

@entity5 assumed her two - year - old son had a stomach bug
four weeks after diarrhoea had n't improved , she took him to the gp
received @entity277 ( @entity1 ) diagnosis she 'd never heard of
