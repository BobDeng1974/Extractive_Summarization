@entity1 manager @entity0 could hand @entity2 a @entity4 debut after acknowledging why the @entity6 starlet has been compared to @entity7			1
@entity2 joined @entity1 on a season - long loan last friday but did not figure in the matchday squad for the @entity11 victory over @entity12 the following day as it was considered too soon for him to play a part			1
but @entity2 and @entity15 defender @entity14 , who has received international clearance to play after his Â£ 8million move from @entity18 , could both make their @entity1 debuts against @entity21 outfit @entity20 on tuesday night			1
' he 's a very good footballer who will very much suit us , ' @entity0 said ahead of the second - round tie at the @entity37			2
' we 've watched him , done our analysis over the years , seen him at @entity6 and a lot of him at @entity40			0
' i 've spoken to a lot of people who have trained with him and coached him and they speak very highly of him ' he can show that good side of football we need because he 's good with the ball			0
' he can pass and move and get himself in good positions and i think he 'll offer us another option			0
' @entity2 and @entity7 were @entity6 team - mates before the @entity52 playmaker joined @entity25 in 2012 and their styles as creative midfielders has often been compared			1
@entity56 curve : @entity2 and @entity7 ( left ) were @entity6 team - mates before the @entity52 joined @entity25 but @entity2 , who has made 23 @entity6 appearances since making his debut in 2011 , has had to leave @entity60 to gain more first - team experience , first at @entity62 and then in the @entity21 at @entity63 and @entity40			1
' i can see why people say that about him and @entity7 , ' @entity0 said			2
' a lot of people will talk about the strength side of the game but it 's something we believe in here			0
' we 've shown over the years with @entity31 and @entity71 that if you pass the ball quickly and move quickly it does n't matter about the physical side of the game			0
new boy : @entity78 ( right ) signed @entity2 on a season - long loan last friday , but the midfielder is yet to feature ' he can improve on that side , but he suits our philosophy and i think he can show what a good footballer he is and we believe he is			1
' @entity1 won the @entity4 two seasons ago when @entity88 was in charge and @entity78 would relish another run in the competition after making a flying start to the @entity11 campaign			2
@entity78 is expected to rotate his squad ahead of saturday 's league visit from @entity96 but he wants to keep the momentum going after opening top - flight wins against @entity99 and @entity12			2
points : @entity78 's @entity1 side have enjoyed a bright start to the season , winning both of their first two games ' it 's been a great cup for us and i want us to do well again , ' @entity0 said			1
' when you 've won two games in a row you want to keep that momentum going and this is the next game for us			0
' a cup run gives everyone confidence and we do n't want to give anything up easily			0
' we want to fight for everything , every cup game , every league game			0
