social workers have been accused of ' misguided political correctness ' after they considered sending a boy in their care to the @entity4 for a ' deeply traumatising ' exorcism			1
bosses at @entity7 in north @entity8 considered sending the @entity10 boy to the @entity4 because his mother claimed he was possessed by evil spirits and needed ' deliverance '			1
an expert has claimed that @entity16 council officials were ' mindful to agree to the request ' for exorcism , which it is claimed involved starving children and sometimes beating them			1
traumatising : dr @entity21 claimed @entity10 exorcisms on children can be ' disturbing and violent ' ( file picture ) the boy 's family , who were from @entity10 , had claimed an exorcism was necessary because he was possessed by ' kindoki ' or evil spirits			1
the child 's mother no longer has responsibility for him , and he had been taken into care by @entity7			2
the local authority paid an expert over £ 4,000 to travel to @entity10 to investigate the possibility of an exorcism as they were worried the family 's ' sensibilities might be affected '			1
dr @entity21 , an expert in @entity10 religion , completed the trip and advised the council the boy should not be exorcised as the rituals can be ' violent ... deeply disturbing and traumatising '			1
dr @entity21 has since told how the case - which @entity7 later dropped on his advice - highlights how @entity48 officials do not tackle abuse when it is ' masked behind multiculturalism '			1
african religion expert dr @entity21 said @entity7 were ' mindful to agree to the request ' for the child to be exorcised according to the @entity53 , dr @entity21 told a conference yesterday : ' we fear to trend where sensibilities might apparently be affected			1
' ' this problem is about the underlying failure to tackle abuse when it is masked behind multiculturalism			0
' dr @entity21 added that officials do not challenge the mistreatment of children when it is committed under the guise of ' religious or cultural practices '			2
dr @entity21 visited @entity67 , the capital of @entity4 , in 2005 , where he met the grandparents of the child			0
the grandparents claimed the boy had been ' infected by sorcery ' in the @entity48 which would ' destroy them all '			1
church officials in @entity4 also claimed that the evil spirits would lead to ' strife , illness , divorce , hardship , poverty and death ' if not dealt with			2
the ritual would have involved depriving the boy of food or fluids for three days in order to ' cast out ' the evil spirit			2
although dr @entity21 was assured the boy would not be beaten , his investigation found evidence that other children who had been exorcised suffered violence and were left ' scared and traumatised '			2
he concluded his work , for which the council paid £ 4,372 , by telling the authority the ' child should not be be allowed to go through a deliverance service such as that envisaged '			0
dr @entity21 added : ' from my research i think this might be deeply disturbing and traumatising for him			0
' @entity7 acknowledged to the @entity53 that they had paid dr @entity21 to go to @entity10 , but said they did so on the recommendations of a judge			1
a spokesperson said : ' it is a normal process in care proceedings to assess the extended family when a child has been removed from parental care , ' a spokesman said			0
' dr @entity21 was instructed to meet with extended family members to assess their belief that a child of the family was possessed by spirits			0
this was on the instruction of the @entity118 during care proceedings			0
' a spokesman for the @entity121 echoed the findings of dr @entity21 , adding : ' it is not acceptable for councils to be considering this			0
these services can be extremely traumatic			0
' we are tackling all forms of child abuse linked to belief , including belief in witchcraft or spirit possession			0
' such abuse is rightly condemned by people of all cultures , communities and faiths			0

@entity7 considered agreeing to parents ' request for boy to undergo ' disturbing and violent ' ritual
expert claims @entity48 officials investigated possibility because they were worried about their ' sensibilities might be affected '
