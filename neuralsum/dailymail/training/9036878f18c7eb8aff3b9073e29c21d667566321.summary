by @entity0 published : 18:01 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 07:57 est , 15 august 2013 @entity2 staff infected with the @entity4 virus will be allowed to carry out operations and other invasive procedures for the first time			1
a ban which has been in place for more than 20 years is to be lifted by the government , which says it will not put patient safety at risk			1
the ban was imposed because of fears that if an hiv positive surgeon or dentist cut themselves during certain types of operation , it could result in the patient becoming infected			1
in another move , from next year , people will be able to buy @entity15 self - testing kits that are currently illegal for home use			1
@entity44 ’s chief medical officer , professor dame @entity43 , said science had moved on and it was time to scrap ‘ outdated rules ’			1
she said lifting the operating ban on healthcare staff would bring the @entity50 into line with most other @entity53 countries			0
an estimated 110 staff working in the @entity2 would be affected by the change , based on the numbers of @entity50 with @entity15			0
from next april , anyone with @entity15 wanting to carry out surgical and dental procedures would have to go on a confidential register and have three - monthly testing to ensure they were complying with treatment			2
prof @entity63 said : ‘ we ’ve got outdated rules			1
at the moment we bar totally safe healthcare workers who are on treatment with @entity15 from performing many surgical treatments , and that includes dentists			0
’ she said modern anti-retroviral drugs enabled people with @entity15 to lead normal lives , adding : ‘ with effective treatment , they are not infectious			0
’ the risk to patients was ‘ absolutely negligible ’			0
about 100,000 people in the @entity50 are living with @entity15 , although experts say a quarter of those infected do not know it			2
in 2011 , there were 6,000 new diagnoses of @entity15 in the @entity50			0
prof @entity63 said changing the rules would help remove some of the stigma of the disease and encourage healthcare workers who believed they could be at risk to get tested because their careers would no longer be on the line			2
although they are under a professional obligation to get tested in such circumstances , she admitted ‘ a few ’ might not do so for fear of the consequences			0
lifting the ban : @entity44 's chief medical officer , professor dame @entity43 , said science had moved on and it was time to scrap ' outdated rules ' under the new rules , healthcare workers with @entity15 will be allowed to undertake all procedures if they are on effective combination of anti-retroviral drug therapy			1
they must also have an undetectable viral load of @entity15 in their system , and must be regularly monitored			0
@entity44 will set up a confidential register holding data on infected workers			1
there have been four cases worldwide of health workers infecting patients since 1992 , with no cases in the @entity50			0
none of the workers was on drug treatment at the time			2
@entity15 was no longer a killer disease , prof @entity63 said			0
' we ’ve got outdated rules			1
at the moment we bar totally safe healthcare workers who are on treatment with @entity15 from performing many surgical treatments , and that includes dentists ' professor dame @entity43 , @entity44 's chief medical officer she added : ‘ what we need is a simpler system that continues to protect the public through encouraging people to get tested for @entity15 as early as possible and that does not hold back some of our best healthcare workers because of a risk that is more remote than being struck by lightning			1
’ @entity139 , chief executive of the @entity140 , said : ‘ allowing healthcare workers living with @entity15 to undertake exposure - prone procedures corrects the current guidance which offers no more protection for the general public but keeps qualified and skilled people from working in the career they had spent many years training for			1
’ @entity150 scientific adviser professor @entity149 added : ‘ dentists in the @entity50 comply with rigorous infection control procedures to protect both patients and the dental team against the risk of transmission of blood - borne infections			2
’ sir @entity158 , chief executive at @entity15 charity @entity159 , said : ‘ advances in medication have transformed what it means to live with @entity15 , and it ’s great to see regulations starting to catch up			2
‘ people diagnosed in good time can have full , healthy lives , and effective treatment dramatically reduces the risk of the virus being passed on			0
‘ so long as the right safeguards are in place , there is now no reason why a dentist or a midwife with @entity15 should be barred from treating patients , or why people who would prefer to test at home should be denied that chance			0

@entity182 in place for more than 20 years to be lifted by the government
had been fears that a cut @entity4 - infected surgeon could infect patient
@entity44 's chief medical officer says it 's time to scrap ' outdated rules '
