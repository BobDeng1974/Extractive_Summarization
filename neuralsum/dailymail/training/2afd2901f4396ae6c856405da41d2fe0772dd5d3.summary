@entity13 is paid to give his opinion as a pundit but it is not as black and white as that			1
' @entity13 was a player himself			2
no player plays well in every game and every month and @entity13 should know that			2
they have good spells and bad spells			0
' if @entity3 is not at his best at the minute then the next game or the week or two weeks after he will be at his best			1
' @entity3 has played a lot of games for us where he has dictated the tempo of the game at both ends of the pitch			2
if you can do that you have got to be a good player			0
' for me i am just glad he is playing			0
and i know @entity3 , he needs to keep playing and playing regularly , that is when we see the best of him			2
' @entity3 in action for @entity4 against @entity11 - the @entity14 threw away a three - goal lead to draw @entity3 grimaces in pain on the ground during the @entity12 match at the @entity65 @entity3 is one of eight players heading to @entity67 having recovered from injury , a list that also includes defenders @entity70 , @entity72 and @entity73			1

' we 've rarely had @entity84 and @entity3 together , ' @entity0 said			1
' it is nice to have @entity3 back and @entity84 had a good game against @entity88 and did very well			1
two players of that calibre are going to improve any squad , we know that , so it is very good to have them back			2
' i thought @entity94 played fantastically and @entity84 was at the heart of it so that was pleasing to see			0

' he does n't want to not be here , he wants to carry on			0
he spoke with the @entity103 chairman ( @entity115 ) , who has been very supportive , so it is very positive			0
' the one area where @entity0 's 25 - man group looks particular light is up front			2
@entity102 is set to continue with his @entity1 duties despite being appointed manager of @entity103 they may have the world 's most expensive player of all time in @entity126 , but he is joined by four forwards with just 28 caps between them due to injuries to @entity130 , who started all three previous @entity26 qualifiers , and @entity133 's @entity132			1
