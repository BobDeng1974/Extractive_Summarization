by @entity0 guardrails at the side of the nation 's road which are supposed to offer protection in the event of a car crash could be making things worse according to an industry whistleblower			2
a guardrail meant to save you in a crash could instead end up slicing through a car			0
according to @entity15 a ' design change ' may be the cause of the problem on some 600,000 guardrails around the country			1
lawsuit : @entity21 is suing @entity22 and its @entity24 - based owner , @entity25 , alleging that it made a quiet design change that transformed guardrail systems across the @entity28 into potentially deadly hazards whistleblower : @entity15 says one particular model of guardrail is failing at an alarming rate @entity15 , a guardrail engineer from @entity34			1
he is the plaintiff in a federal ' @entity36 ' lawsuit against @entity37 - based @entity25 , maker of a popular model of guardrail end terminals the guardrail end terminals ¿ or ¿ heads ¿ as they ¿ re called by engineers ¿ are designed to absorb the energy of a crash if you look closely at guardrails you may have seen rectangles that are called ' guardrail end terminals ' or ' heads '			2
in a collision , the the force of the crash feeds the w - shaped guardrail into the head , where it gets flattened into a ribbon of steel , curling off to the side			0
the process absorbs the energy of the crash and slows down the vehicle			0
but @entity15 who is a manufacturer of guardrails and owns a company that installs and repairs the terminals says one of the biggest competitors has modified its end terminals without telling the government -- shrinking the length , the height and the width -- to save money			1
one of many examples : firefighters in @entity76 , @entity77 , extricate a 22 - year - old man who was impaled by a guardrail on june 9 , 2013 crashed out : @entity15 has gone around the country taking photos of accidents where the guardrails failed on - message : @entity86 s lawsuit alleges that @entity25 changed the dimensions of the @entity89 guardrail some time between 2002 and 2005 without telling federal authorities			1
he says that he will not stop spreading his message until the designs are altered another example : @entity21 points to @entity96 ' @entity95 in the junkyard			1
a length of guardrail pierced his door , according to the police report , driving the 24 - year - old ¿ s body into the opposite back seat in his whistleblower lawsuit , @entity15 says the new model ' causes the guardrail to double over on itself or protrude through the crashing vehicle			1
' in a rather gruesome description , @entity15 says that during a crash the vehicle can flip around thje @entity111 shaped beam can cut through the metal of a car and slice of legs - even cut people in half			1
@entity15 says he found this information while defending himself against a patent infringement lawsuit filed by @entity120 ; it ended with a confidential settlement			0
@entity25 claims that @entity15 is simply a sore loser and that he was forced to stop producing an end - terminal to the guardrail that was similar to theirs			2
@entity15 told @entity127 , ' that is something that is per se , a red herring , they 're trying to distract from it			0
whether i 'm trying to sell the company or whether i 'm trying to stay in business has no bearing on the fact that they 're failing , people are getting injured , killed			0
' slight change : the guardrails have not been altered substantially but the suit alleges the end terminal piece has been reduced in width to four inches from five on a mission : @entity15 ( right ) goes from state to state and city to city telling anyone who will listen about the supposedly deadly guardrails @entity15 claims to have identified more than 100 accidents in which the head of the guardrail failed to function properly			1
in 2008 , a crash in @entity155 killed a 38 - year - old paramedic died when a guardrail entered the passenger compartment of her @entity159			0
@entity25 has filed defamation lawsuits against @entity15 in several states			0
the company claims that @entity15 ' has published false and malicious statements about its highway safety products , falsely claiming that @entity89 heads are killing people ... and are failing completely			2
' the suit claims ' @entity15 hopes to financially benefit from ... a class action lawsuit against the plaintiffs			0
' the @entity170 approved the guardrail head design by @entity25 , however @entity15 points out that changes were made after a crash test in may 2005			1
he alleges that the federal government were not notified about the changes			0
@entity15 has made his position clear that he will not withdraw his whistleblower lawsuit , unless the deal includes a recall of the redesigned guardrail heads .			2

@entity21 claims a redesign of guardrails have made then *unsafe* should drivers crash into them
@entity15 worked for a guardrail design company , but the ones he says are at fault are made by a competitor
the company , @entity22 states its designs were approved by the government
@entity15 points out the redesign , although only minor , can do serious *damage* to the *occupants* of a vehicle
