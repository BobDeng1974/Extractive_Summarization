the latest unsavoury incident involving @entity5 ’s wild child has heightened fears that someone soon will break cricket ’s last great taboo and spark a punch - up during a high profile game , possibly even during the forthcoming @entity25			1
if it does happen then there is a fair chance it will involve @entity0 , who found himself accused by some of racism when he clashed with @entity3 during @entity5 ’s tri-series victory over @entity6 and implored him to ‘ speak @entity2			1
’ @entity0 and @entity3 exchange words during @entity5 's clash with @entity6 in @entity35 @entity3 and @entity0 were separated by the umpires after tempers flared between the pair on the crease @entity0 was unhappy after @entity6 took a single when when he felt the ball deflected off @entity3 's pads it was @entity10 who was thumped by @entity0 in the incident at the @entity45 in @entity46 that unsettled @entity5 ’s @entity48 preparations in 2013 and revealed the @entity49 to be something more than a fresh - faced newcomer			1
almost two years on @entity10 is still baby - faced with a smile that suggests butter would not melt in his mouth but opponents know him to be much more street-wise than he looks and @entity58 in particular hit him hard verbally last summer			1
‘ i ca n’t see it to be honest , ’ said @entity10 when asked whether we will soon see cricket ’s first real bout of fisticuffs			1
‘ someone will have to be in a really bad place to do that			0
there have been a few things that have happened over the last few months that have n’t been good for the game but i ca n’t see it leading to a punch - up			1
it ’s not ice hockey			1
’ maybe so but while @entity0 in particular is around there is always a chance something worse than the ugly scenes which marred sunday ’s match in @entity35 , which led to @entity0 being pulled away from @entity3 , could happen			1
@entity79 , the @entity80 cricket correspondent , tried to make the point in a piece in the @entity83 that an opportunity is in danger of being wasted if players do not clean up their act in the wake of the tragic death of @entity90			2
@entity91 's @entity10 ( left ) was thumped by @entity0 in the incident at the @entity45 in @entity46 @entity91 batsman @entity10 is still baby - faced but was on the receiving end of a punch from @entity5 's @entity0 @entity10 feels cricket 's last taboo will remain intact because it ' is not ice hockey ' where punch - ups are regular @entity79 ’s comments went down badly here because , understandably , emotions on the subject of @entity90 are still very raw but the point he was making is valid , particularly as @entity0 in particular has been quick to forget his own pledge to think twice before indulging in confrontations on the field			1
@entity107 , the former @entity108 captain , accused @entity0 of being a thug and insisted that cricket needs to do more to stop the trouble - makers			1
‘ there is a growing concern that @entity0 ’s thuggish behaviour has gone too far , ’ wrote @entity107 in an eloquent piece for @entity113			2
’ soon one day it will lead to an incident that will sully the game for good			2
‘ soon enough someone is going to get king - hit on a cricket field			2
and if it is him who gets hammered it will be overdue – if wrong			0
fining these serial offenders is not going to work			0
you have to take them out of the game for extended periods			0
two yellow cards should result in a red card , which would ban any player for six months			0
’ the idea of red and yellow cards in cricket has long been a proposal of @entity136 ’s @entity135 but his pleadings to the @entity138 have so far fallen on deaf ears			0
@entity10 thinks the suggestion has its merits			2
‘ why not ? @entity142 at the suggestion of football - type cards			0
‘ it seems there ’s a lot of people who are not happy with the way players are conducting themselves on the field so if that will sort it out then why not			0
’ @entity0 of @entity5 kisses the ground after scoring 63 runs in memory of late cricketer @entity90 but he feels the bulk of players are fully aware of their responsibilities			2
‘ when you ’re out there your job is to score runs or take wickets and if your focus is elsewhere then you ’re not doing your best for the team			0
you just instinctively know where the line is			0
it ’s about showing respect for each other			0
’ @entity0 , who has been fined 50 per cent of his match fee , attempted to defend himself over an incident which was sparked when @entity5 , wrongly , felt @entity6 had run for an overthrow despite the ball deflecting off @entity3			1
‘ in cricket etiquette when you throw a ball to the keeper and it hits a player you do n’t run , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ when i went over to him he said something in their language and i said ‘ speak @entity2 ’ because if you ’re going to say something for me to understand i can not speak @entity185			1
‘ so i did the polite thing and asked him to speak @entity2 and i thought that was okay			1
i got slapped on the wrist and i should n’t have engaged him			0
he told me what he had said in @entity2 and i ca n’t repeat it but i was in the wrong			2

@entity194 reached his hundred off 31 balls , the fastest in a one - day international , and went on to 149 off 44 balls			0
it is an extraordinary display that frankly it is near impossible to imagine an @entity91 player emulating			0
@entity10 insists that what this young @entity91 side , who face @entity6 here at the @entity213 on tuesday in what is already a must - win game , are aiming for			1
‘ he is a bit of a freak , he ’s a very good player , but as a side that ’s what we ’re aiming to do , to get those big scores , said @entity10			2
‘ okay , it would be a serious effort to get anywhere near that but as a side that ’s our aim moving forward			0
' i think we ’re not far away from doing that now			0
