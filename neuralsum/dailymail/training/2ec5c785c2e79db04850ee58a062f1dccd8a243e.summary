by @entity0 published : 19:29 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 19:29 est , 28 november 2013 more than 80 per cent of patients on some hospital wards would not want their loved ones treated there , according to the government ’s own figures			1
they show there are 19 wards across @entity9 where at least half of patients there last month would not recommend the care to their friends and family			1
the worst is @entity16 ’s ward 12 , which specialises in illnesses of the stomach and intestine and which none of the patients said they would recommend			1
no - go : @entity16 's ward 12 which no patients said they would recommend in @entity27 ’s @entity26 , only six of 41 patients who took part in the survey last month would be happy for loved ones to receive treatment there			1
the government launched its flagship ‘ friends and family ’ test in april to measure levels of care and give patients and relatives more information about standards in hospitals			1
it can be filled in by any patient going to casualty or staying overnight on a ward and consists of a simple question : ‘ how likely are you to recommend our ward / @entity49 department to friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment ? ’ patients tick one of six boxes – extremely likely , likely , neither , unlikely , extremely unlikely or do n’t know			1
each hospital , @entity49 unit and ward is then given a score of between -100 and 100 , which is the number of ‘ positive ’ patients minus the ‘ negative ’ patients			1
in @entity27 ¿ s @entity26 , only six of 41 patients who took part in the survey last month would be happy for loved ones to receive treatment there any score above 0 is regarded as good , while above 50 is seen as excellent			0
the latest results show the average @entity49 score is 50 , while the average for hospital wards is 72			0
the test has been described as the @entity77 ’s equivalent of ‘ @entity78 ’ – the website where the public can recommend restaurants and hotels			1
the public can see the scores on the @entity86 website along with comments from other patients			0
the government has told hospitals to ensure that at least 15 per cent of patients complete the surveys			2
but the latest monthly figures show that in one @entity49 unit , at @entity95 , in @entity96 , @entity97 , just four out of the 3,547 patients who appeared last month did so			0
latest monthly figures show that in one @entity49 unit , at @entity95 just four out of the 3,547 patients filled out the survey only six of the 3,367 patients who arrived at @entity104 last month completed the poll – fewer than 0.2 per cent			0
these figures will fuel concerns that staff are handing forms only to patients they know are pleased with their care			0
but @entity9 said response rates have steadily improved since the surveys were launched six months ago			2
patients are also asked whether there is anything they would change on the ward			2
@entity118 in @entity119 has rolled out quietly - closing bins and dimmer lights after patients complained that it was too noisy and too bright at night			0
health secretary @entity123 said the surveys represented ‘ real patient power ’ and were ‘ driving hospitals to raise their game ’			2
hospitals with consistently low scores are referred to the @entity130 .			0

at least half of patients would not recommend 19 wards in @entity9
the worst is @entity16 's ward 12
