we know all about her friday night suppers			2
she ’s even told us about her father ’s @entity10 costumes ( one year , a sumo outfit )			2
as if that was n’t enough information , now socialite - turned - columnist @entity13 has regaled us with tales of her schoolgirl crush on her hockey coach – and how her ‘ derriere ’ helped her out on the netball pitch			1
alas , the ‘ undeniably fanciable ’ object of her affections may be less than delighted to find himself the subject of her latest column , ‘ confessions of a sporty schoolgirl ’ – he has just started a new job as the head of a prestigious school			1
crush : @entity13 , pictured in @entity32 earlier this week , has described her old pe teacher as ' undeniably fanciable ' miss @entity13 , 29 , wrote the article for this week ’s spectator			1
she describes how she was the proud captain of the hockey team at @entity37 in @entity38 , which her sister @entity39 , now the @entity39 , also attended			1
she writes : ‘ when i close my eyes and think about school sports , i envisage myself on the hockey pitch , stick in hand , a luminous gumshield locked on to my chops and a bandana across my forehead			1
( bandanas were all the rage back then )			0
@entity13 's old @entity52 teacher mr @entity51 ‘ boys are watching			1
i can also hear the booming voice of mr @entity51 , our fierce but undeniably fanciable coach , urging us all on			0
’ she adds later : ‘ did i mention the boys watching ? ’ last night the @entity58 tracked down the object of her teenage crush , @entity51 , 41 , himself a one - time @entity62 international hockey star			1
he has just started a new job as head of a top private school in @entity67 , where his efforts to establish himself with his pupils are unlikely to be aided by miss @entity13 ’s happy memories			1
twelve years older than miss @entity13 , he would have been in his early twenties and newly on the staff of @entity37 when she became a pupil			1
mr @entity51 , from @entity74 , read history at @entity76 and represented @entity62 at hockey at the 1998 @entity78			1

he said : ‘ i think he will be abashed by the description			0
but @entity39 [ his wife ] will think it is quite funny			0
’ he added : ‘ i would not say he was “ fierce ” but he does have what i would call a traditional school teacher look – he can look at you in a way that gets your attention			0
’ he said mr @entity51 ’s mother , @entity97 , who died a few years ago , would have agreed with the description			0
‘ she was a schoolteacher and she had that same look as well , ’ he said			0

he lives with his wife and their two children in a large detached house that comes with the job			0
last night he said : ‘ i taught at @entity37 for 20 years and we categorically never comment on pupils or former pupils			1
’ but despite her fondness for mr @entity51 , he was not the man @entity13 was most worried about			1
she recalls : ‘ the other mr m in my life ( father and also coach ) is on the sidelines , and i ’m desperate to impress him most of all			0
’ elsewhere in the column she reveals she also played netball , which she describes as ‘ like basketball with all the fun bits taken out ’			0
but she said the shoulder - barging , though brutal , ‘ turns out to have been very useful practice for handling the media in later life ’			2
cheered on : @entity13 , pictured ( right ) at @entity140 with her parents , says that the man she most wanted to impress with her hockey skills however , was the ' other mr m in her life ' - her father @entity145 ( centre ) she wrote : ‘ you spend most of the time playing a complex version of piggy - in - the - middle , except the piggies are a pack of vicious girls			1
my petite physique enabled me to nip and tuck my way past the bigger - chested girls			2
‘ elbows always helped ; as did the derriere for defence ( my “ chest ” had n’t developed back then ) and a bit of shoulder - barging here or there			2
’ she said her ‘ piano legs ’ helped her do well at cross country , adding : ‘ we @entity13 girls were always at the starting line – albeit reluctantly – fuelled by @entity169 tablets and bananas			1
‘ @entity173 was inevitable and we ’d get caked in mud from head to toe , in our tiny athletic shorts , white @entity178 and all			0
’ she said the worst horror of all was the swimming gala , and in particular the changing rooms where ‘ everyone had to walk around sheepishly in tight @entity185 bathing suits ’			0
