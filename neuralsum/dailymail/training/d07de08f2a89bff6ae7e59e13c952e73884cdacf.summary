by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:35 est , 11 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:36 est , 11 december 2013 a combination of two drugs is highly effective at keeping some women with breast cancer free of the disease , say researchers			2
almost 99 per cent of women given the @entity13 - @entity12 combination remained cancer - free for at least three years after treatment , a study found			1
the trial looked at the effect of the two drugs in patients with a specific type of breast cancer that responds to @entity13			2
almost 99 per cent of women given a combination of the drugs herceptin and @entity12 combination remained cancer - free for at least three years after treatment all had lower - grade tumours that had not spread to the lymph nodes			1
around one in four women with breast cancer have tumours characterised by the @entity32 protein			1
here , there is too much of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( @entity32 ) on the surface of their cells			0
the extra @entity32 receptors stimulate the cancer cells to divide and grow			0
herceptin locks on to the @entity32 protein			2
this blocks the receptor and stops the cells from dividing and growing			0
however the drug is normally reserved for those at higher risk			0
the new study showed that giving lower - risk women with @entity32 breast cancer herceptin plus the chemotherapy drug @entity12 was highly effective with few adverse side effects			1
the drug could help the one in four women with breast cancer tumours characterised by the @entity32 protein of the 406 patients studied , fewer than 4 per cent experienced serious complications in the form of nerve damage and temporary heart failure			1
' this is great news for patients and their physicians , ' said professor @entity64 , from @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67 , who presented the findings at the @entity71 @entity70			0
' this study identifies a new treatment option for this population of patients that is highly effective and has minimal side effects			0

almost 99 per cent of women given the @entity13 - @entity12 combination remained cancer - free for at least three years after treatment
around *25* per cent of women have tumours characterised by the @entity32 protein - and they could *benefit* from this treatment
