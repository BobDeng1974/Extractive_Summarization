in tests , it took just minutes to home in on bowel tumours before dramatically shrinking them			0
in some cases , mice whose cancer was thought to be terminal were cured			1
the drugs also act by ‘ stealth ’ , sneaking into cancerous areas without causing damage to the surrounding healthy cells			0
in standard cancer treatments , such as chemotherapy , drugs attack anywhere in the body , meaning healthy cells as well as cancerous ones are damaged			2
this indiscriminate attack on the body ’s cells leads to side effects including hair loss and nausea			2
but using the new technique , normal cells should not be affected , meaning that patients are spared the usual side effects			2
excitingly , the @entity43 researchers believe the same technique could be used to combat other cancers , such as those of the breast , prostate , lung and skin			1
bowel cancer is @entity53 ’s second biggest cancer killer , after lung cancer , and claims more than 16,000 lives a year			1
the @entity57 researchers began by searching for a compound that targets tumours rather than healthy tissue			2
they settled on one called @entity61 , a small protein that seeks out the blood vessels that tumours need to grow and spread around the body			0
they attached @entity67 to a fluorescent probe and injected it into mice with bowel tumours			0
within minutes , the tumours lit up			0
bowel cancer is @entity53 's second biggest cancer killer , after lung cancer			1
it claims more than 16,000 lives a year they then linked @entity61 to a powerful cancer drug , gave the two - in - one compound to diseased mice , and watched the tumours shrink			1
the results were dramatic , with many treated tumours disappearing completely within a fortnight , even at low doses			0
writing in the journal @entity86 , the researchers said that @entity61 targets tumours with ‘ unprecedented ’ speed .			0
