for @entity3 the latest chapter in their remarkable story featured not one , but two , plot - changing twists			1
one featured penalty @entity7 did n't get for 2 - 0 in which @entity9 handball should have also led to a sending off			1
the other the spot kick they did , followed by a red card for @entity14			1
' i 've not seen it yet , but going by the reaction of the @entity7 players we got away with a penalty and a sending off and that was probably the turning point in the game , ' acknowledged @entity25 manager @entity24 after			1
@entity3 's @entity9 appears to get away with a handball on the line in their win over @entity7 @entity25 boss @entity24 says the break , which could have meant a penalty and red card , was a turning point ' i 've not spoken to @entity9			1
i have n't seen it - but going by the media it was definitely a hand ball			1
we look at the referee behind the line and all that and i know @entity40 will feel aggrieved - because i certainly would			1
' but it 's part and parcel of football and you need a wee bit of luck to beat @entity7			1
' this was their biggest game of the season because they will go on and win the league and if they had beaten us today there was a good chance they would have gone on and won the @entity56			1
' but when @entity58 was clipped by @entity14 and they were down to 10 men that was advantage @entity3			1
' we were n't going to give @entity7 the ball back , they had to come and get it and we had to be patient			1
' when big @entity65 put us into the lead we thought it was going to be our day on the back of things that had happened			2
' @entity7 equalised with another free kick but it 's typical of @entity3 that we do n't do anything easy			1
' we do it the hard way and we came up with the winner through @entity75			2
' @entity24 hauled @entity76 , his @entity78 defender , from his backside as extra-time beckoned			1
offended by the sight of one of his players resting he had a message to impart			2
@entity87 players celebrate after upsetting @entity7 in a @entity56 semi-final 3 - 2 thriller @entity7 , depleted by games and absentees , were virtually on their knees after a relentless programme of midweek games			1
in last season 's @entity3 had been passive and unambitious prior to losing on penalties			1
this was no time to repeat the mistake			2
' i tried to emphasise to the players they would never have a better time to go on and beat @entity7 , down to 10 men in the semi final of a cup			1
we needed to go for it , ' @entity24 said			1
' before @entity76 scored at the back post i was looking to change it			1
i was going to bring on another winger , @entity108 , and put him in the full - back position over on the right , but more advanced so he could take their left back on			2
thankfully i did n't do that and @entity75 came up with the goal			0
@entity114 ( centre ) fired @entity7 into an early lead with a superb free - kick in the 18th minute ' i did n't realise this is the first time the club have been in the final of the @entity56 and that 's a remarkable achievement given it was only formed 20 years ago			1
' it is a great story is n't it ? it 's an absolutely fantastic story			2
it is 20 odd years since the amalgamation			0
we are a small provincial club up there in the @entity129			0
' we have lost a real inspirational skipper in @entity131 right from the start of the season			0
we have had to adjust to that			0
' we had to sell @entity135 , our top goalscorer , at @entity136			0
we have had to go again and adjust			0
i am a very humble guy and i am grateful and thankful that injuries have never caught up with us			0
' there is remarkable irony in the fact @entity142 will be the opponents for the final			0
a former @entity147 captain , he was manager of the club in 2009 when they lost to @entity150 at @entity151			2
former @entity142 captain and manager @entity24 will take on his former club in the final ' i had a lot of great times at @entity142			1
so much so that it is possibly my favourite time in my playing career			0
i am still friendly with an awful lot of the characters who were in that dressing room			0
@entity164 is a good friend of mine from my @entity142 days			0
he comes along and sits on the bench and gives me a wee hand out			0
' that is the spirit that we had at that club			0
i have met some great guys			0
@entity172 , my ex-coach , @entity174 , @entity175 , the list is endless			0
i was just talking the other day about that day at @entity142			0
there are times even now when i see			0
' i have a real special , special feel for the place			0
i am not kidded @entity142 is a right good side , trust me on that			2
no side goes to @entity184 and beats @entity185 without being a good side			2
no side beats @entity188 the way they were playing without being a good side			2
you might say we are favourites i say it is even stevens and i am just looking forward to when the days comes			0
' @entity75 ( second right ) celebrates with his @entity3 team - mates following his extra-time winner an @entity3 and @entity142 final would not have been the choice of sponsors @entity199 , you suspect			2
vast swathes of @entity151 's west stand were empty , a 12.15 kick - off for the benefit of broadcasters proving unhelpful there will be no ticket rows this time			1
not over a final unlikely to raise a crowd much higher than 35,000 in a stadium of 52,000			0
the contract with @entity151 plc is signed , with no question of moving it			0
if the bitter amalgamation of 21 years ago produced a fine football club it also disenfranchised many of those who followed the old ones			0
' i hope this encourages the next generation to follow @entity3 , ' added @entity24			1
' in the peer groups it is still @entity7 and @entity150 they follow but i hope the next ones will want to support their local club			1
' if we can add another few hundred or thousand to the support then we are playing our part			0

@entity9 handball should have been a penalty and a red card
if the penalty was *awarded* and converted @entity7 would have gone to 2 - 0
@entity25 manager @entity24 admitted his side were *fortunate* in win
@entity114 scored @entity7 's opener with a superb free - kick
@entity7 *keeper* @entity14 was sent off early in the second half
@entity246 , @entity247 and finally @entity248 scored for @entity87
