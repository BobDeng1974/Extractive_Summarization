this is no easy task and involves mr @entity11 scaling large trees			0
without the use of his eyes , he is guided by his armless companion as he hauls himself through the branches			0
back on solid ground , he then creates a hole and plants the new shoot			0
it then becomes mr @entity12 's job to water the saplings			1
it has n't been fast work , but now the three hectare site is covered with trees that attract a large number of birds			2
