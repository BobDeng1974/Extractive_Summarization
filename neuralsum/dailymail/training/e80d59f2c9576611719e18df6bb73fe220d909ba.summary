a 12 - year - old thug who bashed a teenager around the head with an iron bar , causing permanent hearing damage , has been sentenced to just three months probation			1
@entity6 , 16 , was cycling to a relative 's home with a friend in @entity10 when they were confronted by a gang of youths , including the younger boy			1
as they tried to cycle away , the 12 - year old whacked @entity6 on the back of the head with the bar , fracturing his skull			1
@entity6 collapsed minutes later and was rushed to hospital where doctors removed a potentially - deadly blood clot on his brain			1
the attack has left the @entity10 teenager partially deaf in one ear			1
but the 12 - year - old attacker , who can not be named for legal reasons , received just a three - month referral order at the city 's youth court after he admitted wounding - and was told to pay his victim just £ 100 compensation			1
@entity6 , 16 , pictured in hospital after the attack which fractured his skull and caused a blood clot after he was attacked , @entity6 managed to make his way home before he collapsed and was rushed to hospital @entity6 now has permanent hearing damage in one ear and must be fitted with a hearing aid if the schoolboy completes the probation order , in future he will not have to disclose his criminal record as the conviction will be ' spent '			1
@entity6 's mother @entity47 has now contacted the @entity48 to demand the case is referred to the attorney general in a bid to increase the sentence			1
she said : ' police were stationed to remain at my son 's hospital to begin with to wait to speak to the surgeon , as his condition was so serious it was not known if he would live			2
' and his attacker gets a referral to a youth offending team			2
what message does it send out ? what deterrent is it ? ' the age of criminal responsibility is ten so why is a 12 - year - old , who smashes a modified metal bar on to my son 's skull in an unprovoked attack , just given a slap on the wrist ? @entity6 , pictured , was attacked by the 12 - year - old for no apparent reason ' @entity6 's life has changed forever , the impact has been devastating			1
i want to see the sentence reviewed and a sentence which fits the crime handed out			0
' @entity6 had been cycling to his aunt 's house with a friend riding on the back of the bike when yobs targeted them in @entity90			1
his mother said : ' @entity6 was about to spend his last night in @entity10 before moving to @entity92 to be with me			1
' he had been staying with my sister , his aunt , while he finished his exams			0
' i went to @entity10 on the saturday to stay overnight and was due to take him home with me the next day			0
' he and his friend @entity96 had been cycling along @entity97 , @entity90 , and were very close to my sister 's house when the attack happened			1
' they saw three lads on the opposite side of the road			0
one shouted across : " have you got a cigarette ? " @entity96 called back , " no , sorry "			0
' the lads then crossed the road and one tried to pull @entity96 off the back of the bike			0
' @entity6 then saw something out of the corner of his eye			1
he thought it was perhaps a hammer , he just saw a glint of metal			0
he ducked his head and then felt something strike the back of his head			2
' @entity6 tried cycling faster to get away			2
he felt something running down the side of his head , put his hand up and saw blood on his hand			2
' at that moment he jumped off the bike , told @entity96 to cycle to the house to get me and then @entity6 himself started running up the road back home			2
' he was in shock at that point			0
meanwhile , myself and other relatives had been sitting down ready to watch the @entity136 game on that night , expecting @entity6 and @entity96 to be back any minute to watch it			2
' the next thing i know @entity96 comes in and behind him @entity139 comes crashing through the door shouting " @entity141 " and collapses on the floor			0
' i leapt up and ran outside , afraid someone may be coming in after him			0
when i get back in , my brother - in - law had got @entity6 into a chair and was giving him first aid			1
@entity6 was still bleeding a lot , was in shock and was shaking			2
' it was the start of a living nightmare for the loving mother			2
@entity6 was rushed by ambulance to @entity155 where a ct scan revealed the teenager had suffered a fractured skull , bleeding on the brain and a significant blood clot			1
in the early hours of the following morning - the day he was meant to travelling to @entity92 with his mother - he was transferred to intensive care at @entity163			2
@entity47 ( pictured with her son @entity6 ) is ' disgusted ' at the 12 - year - old attacker 's light sentence he spent more than four hours in theatre undergoing brain surgery to have the clot removed			1
he remained in intensive care for three days and hospital for 11			0
' the surgery was successful and medically he is okay now , although he has lost some of the hearing in one of his ears and requires is going to have to have a hearing aid fitted			1
@entity6 can no longer skateboard , dance , or do any other activities in which he could suffer another fall , as it would risk causing further damage to his head ' but psychologically , the impact of what happened has been devastating			1
he has had to give up so many things			0
he had previously worked in a kitchen and wanted to be a chef when he completed his exams			0
' he was due to start an apprenticeship , but he did a few days and could n't cope with the pace and noise after the attack			0
' he was very active and loved street dancing			0
' he raised money by street dancing for @entity198 - his nan had died of cancer			0
but he has been told he ca n't do that or some of the activities he loved doing before because a fall might cause further damage and it 's too risky			0
' he ca n't do skateboarding , which he enjoyed			0
he gets angry now because he 's frustrated he ca n't pursue the life and activities he had planned			0
' he 's moved to live with me now in @entity92 but it 's not the life he had been looking forward to			0
' police arrested three juveniles after the attack earlier this summer			0
two 14 - year - olds were released without charge			1
a 12 - year - old was charged with wounding , and he appeared at @entity218 last week where he admitted the offence			1
he was handed just a three - month referral order to the @entity221 and was ordered to pay £ 100 compensation to @entity139			0
ms @entity47 said : ' the police said to me : " what can you do with a 12 - year - old ? do you lock him up and perhaps set him on his way to a life of crime ? " ' but i am absolutely disgusted at the sentence , especially considering everything @entity139 has been through and is still going through .			1
