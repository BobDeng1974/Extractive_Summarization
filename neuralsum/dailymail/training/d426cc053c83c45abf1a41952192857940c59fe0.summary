there are many errors , sloppiness and bad judgment			0
‘ it puts egg on our face and we deserve any criticism we get			0
’ mr @entity19 spoke as @entity48 regulator the @entity107 prepared to look into how changes in the way @entity44 calculates risk might have obscured the potential for these trades to do such colossal damage			1

’ he was given the ‘ @entity22 ’ nickname because he was seen as such a ‘ scary and powerful ’ force in the @entity152			0
one trader explained : ‘ it was a play on the @entity89 theme when people were frightened of @entity22 and his powers and referred to him as ‘ ’ @entity22 "			0
' in reality , according to friends and family , mr @entity21 is not a ‘ larger than life figure			2

news : the company 's stock plunged almost 7 per cent in after - hours trading after the loss was announced			2
other bank stocks , including @entity210 and @entity211 , suffered heavy losses as well ( file picture ) mr @entity21 was brought into the @entity215 unit to head its credit desk , where trades were vetted by management			1

the bank quickly paid off its $ 25bn federal bailout and initially enjoyed a good relationship with the @entity228 administration			2

he himself earned a staggering £ 15 million last year and has publicly opposed new regulations being placed on banks , suggesting he has turned against the president			0
@entity44 ’s position has been made more uncomfortable by what those in the @entity152 called the ‘ @entity243 ’ effect			2

as regulators continue to figure out how this restriction can be imposed , it remains unclear whether such a rule would have stopped @entity44 from trading in the way that it did			2
