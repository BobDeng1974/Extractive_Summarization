reveals he did n't think last year 's @entity3 's @entity2 judging panel @entity4 , @entity6 and @entity7 ' did a good enough job ' admits he poached @entity10 for @entity11 to hurt @entity12 concedes he was too optimistic about @entity13 and will be making ' changes ' for this year 's series by @entity16 last updated at 12:19 pm on 20th january 2012 @entity17 has broken his silence on the disastrous decisions he has made which have led to a slump in ratings for @entity3 ’s @entity2 and @entity22			1
the music mogul , who is now back in @entity3 following a month - long holiday , is hoping he can find out what went wrong last year and turn things around for his two biggest shows			1
after a successful 2010 for both series , @entity17 admitted he got ' a bit too cocky ' last year and admitted the slumping viewing figures had ' put my ego in check '			2
humbled : music mogul @entity17 admitted he got ' a bit too cocky ' over the success of his tv shows @entity22 and @entity3 's @entity2 as the 52 - year - old prepared to return to the @entity3 's @entity2 panel full - time for the first time in @entity38 today , @entity17 admitted he was prepared to work hard to get back on top			1
with the brutal honesty he is famous for , @entity17 criticised last year 's @entity11 panel @entity4 , @entity6 and @entity7 for not doing ' a good enough job '			1
he said : ' there are always stars waiting to be discovered			0
sometimes they need to be pointed in the right direction and i do n't think that happened enough during the show last year			2
' 2011 saw @entity17 quit the panels of both @entity22 and @entity3 's @entity2 to focus on launching @entity13			1
@entity51 : @entity4 and @entity6 only appeared on the judging panel of @entity3 's @entity2 for one series , while @entity7 remains of course , @entity13 did n't go too smoothly after he fired @entity54 and the show failed to attract the huge ratings he predicated			1
when he left the @entity59 shows , he felt confident they would continue to succeed after the 2010 finals of @entity22 and @entity3 's @entity2 attracted 19.4million and 15million viewers respectively			1
however , the 2011 series of @entity22 - with new judges @entity64 , @entity66 and @entity67 joining @entity68 - found itself being regularly beaten in the ratings war by @entity71 rival @entity12			1
despite in - fighting between the judges and controversy surrounding contestant @entity75 , the series averaged 14.13million viewers , with 15.5million tuning in to watch @entity77 crowned the winners			0
dropping figures : the new @entity80 ( @entity81 ) @entity68 , @entity67 , @entity66 and @entity64 could n't always compete with @entity12 however , the previous year , a record 19.4million watched @entity83 beat @entity84 to the crown			1
meanwhile , @entity3 's @entity2 peaked in 2009 when 19million saw @entity87 lost to @entity88 , with 15million watching @entity90 triumph in 2010			1
he told @entity91 : ' i got a bit too cocky			0
we got a big wake - up call			0
@entity17 's favourite year : 19.4million people watched @entity83 win @entity22 in 2010 ' we went into 2011 thinking , " it 's all going to be easy " and of course it was n't			1
it was the year my ego was put in check			0
' we all got a bit smug last year , i certainly got a bit too cocky			0
i ended 2010 on a real high , it was the @entity83 year - my favourite year - and the figures for @entity22 were huge			0
' as well as the fall in the @entity59 shows , his new game show @entity110 was surrounded in controversy when it was revealed the £ 1million winner @entity113 had been jailed for assaulting his girlfriend			0
earlier this month , it was revealed @entity17 had poached @entity10 from @entity12 to be a judge on the new series of @entity3 's @entity2 , along with @entity118			1
and after x factor was frequently beaten by @entity12 last year , @entity17 was in the mood for revenge			2
he said : ' i did have this plan , thinking , " you 're not going to be smiling so much next year if this comes off "			0
with us and the @entity71 , i laugh about it , but there is unbelievable rivalry now ... ' but the @entity10 thing was kind of fun			2
my decision to poach her was 70 - 30 on the fact she was on @entity12 and the fact i liked her			2
newbies : @entity17 admitted he was optimistic about the launch of @entity13 with judges ( @entity81 ) @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 ' i knew the @entity71 was putting on @entity143			2
they 've done this to have a pop at @entity22 and to have a go at the @entity11 ratings			0
' @entity143 - a @entity71 version of the hit @entity151 show - will launch in march - the same time @entity3 's @entity2 hits screens			1
meanwhile , @entity17 is also preparing to make ' changes ' to @entity13			0
although the series attracted healthy ratings , they were still a long way off attracting the same audience as @entity17 's former show @entity159			0
whether @entity140 , @entity142 or @entity141 will be returning this year or if @entity161 continues to present the show remains to be seen			0
winners : an average of 15.5million viewers watched @entity77 win last month 's @entity22			0

reveals he did n't think last year 's @entity3 's @entity2 judging panel @entity4 , @entity6 and @entity7 ' did a good enough job '
admits he poached @entity10 for @entity11 to hurt @entity12
