by @entity1 reporter published : 20:22 est , 31 december 2012 updated : 04:37 est , 1 january 2013 farmers across @entity3 have ignored an @entity5 ban on ' pig cages ’ , meaning @entity8 families will continue to eat pork , ham and bacon from cruel factory farms			1
@entity8 farmers stopped using the cages or sow stalls in 1999 because they were so small the huge animals did not even have enough room to turn around			1
the @entity5 finally agreed to outlaw the system across member states from today , but it has emerged that thousands across the continent have failed to meet the deadline			1
caged : farmers across @entity3 have ignored the ban some 60 per cent of all pig meat sold in the high street and through restaurants is imported , suggesting at least some will be from illegal foreign factory farms			2
in natural conditions , sows live in small groups with their young and will spend much of their day foraging and rooting for food			0
factory farming methods have brought the breeding of supersize pigs that find it difficult to move and bear little resemblance to their wild ancestors			0
the pregnant sows turn out vast litters of piglets to be reared for meat and farmers developed a system of cages to restrict their movement			2
these are so narrow that the sows can not turn around or move more than 18 inches forwards or backwards			0
this system has been recognised as cruel for many years , not least because pigs are highly intelligent creatures and are denied any semblance of a natural existence			2
the cramped conditions mean the animals suffer from severe psychological and physical harm			0
cruel : farming minister @entity57 said sow stalls are cruel and said shoppers want to know where their meat comes from farmers across the @entity5 were given 11 years notice that the ban would come into effect in january 2013 , however they and their governments have failed to meet the deadline			1
data published by the @entity67 in december revealed that only one third of @entity70 farms have removed the cages			1
at the same time around half of @entity74 farms still use them and some 43per cent of those in @entity77			1
other countries unable to meet the deadline include @entity80 , @entity81 , the @entity82 and @entity83			2
@entity8 farmers are at a commercial disadvantage because it costs more to rear pigs without using the cages			1
@entity8 farming minister , @entity57 , said : ‘ sow stalls are cruel , they restrict the sow to such an extent that she ca n’t turn around for almost her entire life			1
‘ shoppers care about where their meat comes from and what conditions the animals are reared in			0
’ he said responsibility for enforcing the ban is up to the @entity67 , however this is unlikely to trigger any meaningful sanctions			0
sow stalls were banned in @entity8 in 1999 because they caused psychological and physical harm to pigs ( file picture ) @entity8 ’s @entity107 estimates that around 40,000 ‘ illegal ’ pigs an hour will be entering the @entity3 food chain in january			1
it predicted bacon , ham and pizzas containing their meat will reach our supermarkets , corner shops and restaurants			0
@entity107 chairman , @entity118 , said : ‘ this makes a mockery of @entity3 ’s animal welfare legislation			0
‘ shoppers will need to be very careful about what they choose from supermarket shelves and when eating out in restaurants			0
’ the organisation is advising consumers to buy @entity8 bacon as the only guarantee of avoiding meat from the cage system			2
chief executive of @entity133 , @entity134 , said there is ‘ no excuse ’ for the failure of farmers to miss the cage ban deadline			2
he urged all @entity8 stores and producers to boycott pork from countries which fail to impose a total ban on the cages			1
@entity146 has slammed the sow stalls as worse that battery chicken cages			1
he said : ‘ in my view , it ’s pretty inhumane			0
a pig can stand up , it can sit down , but it ca n’t turn around and it ca n’t scratch itself			0
and basically they ’ll eat in one end and s --- out the other , and they ’ve got nothing to do			0

the ban on sow stalls comes into force in @entity5 today
only one third of @entity70 farms have removed cages
half of @entity74 farms also still using sow stalls
@entity5 farmers given 11 years notice of deadline
@entity8 farmers banned cruel practice in 1999
