the hunt for alien life has been given a boost after scientists discovered a habitable planet almost the same size as @entity6			2
astronomer @entity7 from @entity9 ’s @entity8 in @entity10 made the discovery using data collected by the @entity14 space telescope			0
the unnamed planet was found orbiting an unidentified star in its so - called @entity17 - a region around the star that emits just enough energy , light and temperature for liquid surface water to appear			1
@entity9 's @entity24 used data taken from the @entity14 space telescope to discover a total of five planets orbiting an unnamed @entity28 dwarf star , stock image pictured , with one said to be around 1.1 times the size of @entity6			1
this planet sits on the outer edge of its star 's habitable zone m dwarfs are stars that are much smaller and dimmer than @entity6 ’s sun , and are n’t bright enough to be seen with the naked eye			1
also known as red dwarfs , these stars make up around 70 per cent of all the stars in the galaxy			2
scientists originally discounted the theory that planets around m dwarfs could be habitable because the stars give out such little light and heat , compared to our sun. however , in 2005 , astronomers began searching for habitable planets around these dim stars			2
the planet recently discovered by @entity9 ’s @entity8 is what ’s called a goldilocks planet , orbiting around an @entity28 dwarf			1
goldilocks are planets that orbit inside a star ’s habitable zone - a zone in which proximity to the host star is a certain distance that temperatures on the surface are suitable for water to appear			1
mr @entity7 made the announcement during the search for life beyond the @entity75 conference in @entity76			0
using the @entity14 images , mr @entity7 said he believes he has found a new star system consisting of five planets orbiting an @entity28 dwarf star			1
m dwarfs are stars that are much smaller and dimmer than @entity6 ’s sun , and are n’t bright enough to be seen with the naked eye			1
also known as red dwarfs , these stars make up around 70 per cent of all the stars in the galaxy and range in size			2
by comparison , our sun is called a @entity94 dwarf , and these type of dwarfs account for only 5 per cent of stars in the universe			2
the outermost planet in @entity7 ’s five - planet system is said to be 1.1 times the size of @entity6 and is called a goldilocks planet because it orbits within the @entity28 dwarf ’s habitable zone			1
although other @entity6 - like planets have been discovered previously , @entity7 ’s unnamed goldilocks planet is believed to be the closest in size to our own			1
@entity9 's @entity14 launched in 2009 with the purpose of hunting for @entity6 - like planets			1
it discovered a planetary system last april featuring @entity6 - size planets in a ' habitable zone			1
' @entity114 , pictured right on this illustration , is 1.4 times the size of @entity6 , while kepler - 62e , pictured bottom left , is estimated to be 1.6 times larger @entity9 ’s kepler mission launched in 2009 with the sole purpose of hunting for @entity6 - like planets			1
it discovered a planetary system last april that featured @entity6 - size planets in an ' habitable zone			1
’ dubbed kepler - 62 system , it has five planets in total called 62b , 62c , 62d , 62e and 62f			0
@entity114 is about 1.4 times the size of @entity6 , while kepler - 62e is estimated to be 1.6 times larger			1
@entity129 and the @entity75 : the diagram compares the planets of the inner solar system to @entity129 , a five - planet system about 1,200 light years from @entity6 in the constellation @entity135 discovered last april			2
until now , these were the closest planets to @entity6 , in terms of size both planets are thought to be rocky , or made mostly of ice , and until now were believed to be the most likely to be @entity6 ' doubles '			0
no other details about mr @entity7 ’s discovery have been announced and the official findings are due to be released later this year			0
@entity9 's kepler space telescope has detected almost 3,000 candidate planets outside our solar system - a fifth of which are believed to be ' super-earths ' between 1.25 and twice the size of the @entity6			1
the kepler space observatory , named after the 17th century @entity155 astronomer @entity154 , was launched on 7 march 2009 to scan a portion of the @entity157 for @entity6 - size planets that could harbour life			2
the research team used data from @entity9 's kepler space telescope , which simultaneously and continuously measures the brightness of more than 150,000 stars every 30 minutes			0
when a planet candidate transits , or passes , in front of the star from the spacecraft 's vantage point , a percentage of light from the star is blocked			0
this causes a dip in the brightness of the starlight that reveals the transiting planet 's size relative to its star			0
the size of the star must be known in order to measure the planet 's size accurately			0
to learn more about the properties of the stars , scientists examined sound waves generated by the boiling motion beneath the surface of the star			0
they probe the interior structure of stars just as geologists use seismic waves generated by earthquakes to probe the interior structure of @entity6			0
the science is called asteroseismology			0
the sound waves travel into the star and bring information back up to the surface and these waves cause oscillations that @entity14 observes as a rapid flickering of the star 's brightness			0
small stars ring at high tones while larger stars boom in lower tones			0
the barely discernible , high - frequency oscillations in the brightness of small stars are the most difficult to measure			0
this is why most objects previously subjected to asteroseismic analysis are larger than the sun.			0

the host star has n’t been named but was identified as an @entity28 dwarf
m dwarfs make up 70 *%* of stars in the galaxy and are smaller than our sun
@entity9 astronomers found a total of five planets orbiting this unnamed host
the outermost planet sits in the star ’s habitable zone and may have liquid water on its surface
this so - called goldilocks planet is believed to be 1.1 times the size of @entity6
until now , the most @entity6 - like planet was @entity114 - 1.4 times the size
details of the new star system are due to be announced later this year
