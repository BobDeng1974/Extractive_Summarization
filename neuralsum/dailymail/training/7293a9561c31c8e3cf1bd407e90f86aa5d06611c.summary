by @entity0 last updated at 4:09 pm on 18th november 2011 in a damning indictment of community policing , one in four people has never seen a bobby walking the beat			0
despite millions of pounds being poured into making the forces of law and order more visible , the streets are still too often devoid of that reassuring presence			0
even the ‘ @entity11 bobbies ’ designed for just that purpose are seen infrequently			1
damning indictment of community policing : the revelations will reignite controversy about police efficiency high visibility : the @entity19 spent hundreds of millions of pounds on recruiting and training civilian staff to become @entity21 the disturbing findings were uncovered in a survey of almost 50,000 by the @entity19			1
the @entity24 discovered that 55 per cent of the public had seen police officers or police community support officers walking the beat at least once a month			1
but this fell to one in seven , or 14 per cent , when they were asked if they see officers on a daily basis			1
and 25 per cent said they had not at any stage seen either a fully - fledged police officer or @entity21 on the beat			1
pcsos , introduced by @entity11 when he was home secretary , are supposed to spend the bulk of their time pounding the streets			1
the @entity19 spent hundreds of millions of pounds on recruiting and training the civilian staff , who do not have proper police powers and can not make arrests			1
the revelations will reignite controversy about police efficiency			2
one of the most common demands from members of the public is for more officers on the beat to provide reassurance that they are being protected from thugs and burglars			2
but @entity56 said recently that fewer than one in ten uniformed officers in some forces are available to man the front line at any one time			2
police spending almost doubled , from £ 7.72billion in 1998/1999 to £ 14.55billion a decade later			2
the number of officers increased from 124,756 in march 1998 , to a peak of around 141,000			0
pioneering : @entity11 introduced @entity21 when he was home secretary but , while officer numbers were increasing dramatically , the proportion of time an officer actually spends on patrol fell , from 15.3 per cent to 13.8 per cent			1
police budgets are being cut as part of the government ’s austerity measures – with forces threatening to axe around 16,000 police officers			1
last night @entity75 , chairman of the @entity77 neighbourhood watch trust , said : ‘ it has always been a concern of people that they do not see police officers on the street and with the cuts being implemented the likelihood is they will see even fewer officers			2
‘ that will especially be the case if crime goes up and police resources are stretched to the absolute limit			0
’ the @entity19 survey also found that only half of the public – 52 per cent – were confident that the authorities were effective at reducing anti-social behaviour			1
and just 41 per cent felt the authorities were effective in bringing louts to justice			0
the situation on police visibility has improved			1
in 2006 , four out of ten people said they had never witnessed a police officer or @entity21 on the streets			1
but it will be considered poor progress for the massive investment in extra police and @entity21			1
the survey also found that only 4 per cent had used the online crime maps introduced by the @entity19 to give people a greater idea of crime levels on their street and to increase police accountability			1
when the maps were launched at the start of this year , the website crashed – apparently due to high demand			0
in its report , @entity56 found that there are more officers on duty on a monday morning than at any other time of the week – and the fewest just after midnight on friday when drunken violence soars			0
antiquated shift patterns , court hearings and training requirements mean that in two forces – @entity131 and @entity132 and @entity133 – only 9 per cent of officers can actually tackle crime , it said			2
the watchdog found many other forces fared little better , with an average of 12 per cent of officers available to catch crooks and keep people safe			2
chief @entity56 sir @entity143 also highlighted how one in three members of the police workforce is not employed in a front - line role			0
these include staff working in personnel , maintenance and administration			0
@entity56 is predicting the loss of 16,100 officers by 2015 , along with up to 1,800 community support officers and 16,100 civilian staff , because of budget cuts			0
but it says there is so much waste that £ 1billion – the equivalent of a 12 per cent cut in government funding – could be axed without any reduction in police availability			2
this would be achieved by getting police out from behind their desks			0
critics say repeated promises by @entity168 to cut red tape failed to deliver			0
police minister @entity170 said : ‘ we know the public want their local police to be visible and responsive to their concerns			0
and the police want to be out in their local communities stopping crime , catching criminals and helping victims			0
‘ that ’s why we have swept away central targets and red tape to free up more officers for the frontline			0

findings uncovered in @entity19 survey of 50,000
only 14 per cent see officers on daily basis
results in spite of @entity21 ' @entity11 bobbies ' introduced to boost police visibility
