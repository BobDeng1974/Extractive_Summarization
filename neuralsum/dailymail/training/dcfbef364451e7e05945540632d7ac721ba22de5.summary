by @entity1 reporter published : 22:37 est , 7 june 2012 updated : 04:03 est , 8 june 2012 @entity2 faced criticism today after it emerged that inspection reports which declared two schools inadequate contained a number of identical sentences and phrases			1
@entity10 leaders raised concerns that inspectors are simply ' cutting and pasting ' in reports , warning that there is a problem with formulaic guidelines that inspectors must follow for school visits			1
the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) said that the practice is unacceptable , given that the fate of a school can rest on an inspection			1
concerning : an @entity2 inspection can change a school 's reputation two reports , one on @entity30 in @entity31 , and one on @entity33 in @entity34 , east @entity35 , were found to include a high number of similarities , the @entity28 reported			1
@entity2 said it stood by the judgments in the reports , but is looking into the similarities in wording			1
both contain the sentence : ' some teachers do not plan learning for pupils at their different levels of ability and marking is not leading to improvement			0
' and both state : ' the majority of parents and carers are positive about how well the school develops their children 's skills in reading , writing and mathematics			2
' accusations : two reports , one on @entity30 in @entity31 , and one on @entity33 in @entity34 , east @entity35 , ( pictured ) were found to include a high number of similarities in each report , inspectors disagree with this view			1
both also make similar comments about the low attainment of pupils in reading , writing and maths			0
one goes on to say : ' this is because pupils , especially in @entity75 , have not been taught effectively to sound out individual letters and groups of letters to work out unfamiliar words when reading			0
' they have not been provided with enough opportunities across the curriculum to write at length and their grasp of basic number skills is not as secure as it should be			0
these weaknesses mean the curriculum is inadequate			0
the second says : ' this is because pupils have not been taught effectively to sound out individual letters and groups of letters to work out unfamiliar words			0
' they have not been provided with enough opportunities across the curriculum to write at length , and their grasp of basic number skills is not as secure as it should be			0
' both schools were visited by a team with the same lead inspector who works for @entity100 , a company contracted by @entity2 to carry out inspections			1
@entity102 was inspected in january , with the report , which judged the school should be put into special measures , published in march			2
@entity106 was inspected in march , with the report declaring it inadequate and requiring special measures published a month later			0
an @entity2 spokeswoman said : ' both inspection reports were subject to moderation by @entity2 and we stand by the judgments they record			1
' we are concerned by the similarity of some of the wording used in the two reports and this is being looked into with the inspector concerned			2
' in a statement @entity100 said it aims to ensure that reports ' reflect the uniqueness of schools '			2
' @entity100 stands by the judgments in these two particular reports , ' it said			2
' similarities noted in some of the wording caused concern and are being rigorously investigated			2
if proven , @entity100 will take swift action to stop using the inspector again			0
@entity20 general secretary @entity133 told the @entity28 that he had heard anecdotal accounts of other ' cut and paste ' reports , adding that this is ' not acceptable given that the fate of the school rests on what is written			1
' @entity20 head of research @entity142 said : ' problems are compounded at the second stage of the inspection process when the reports are rewritten by a moderator - someone who has never been to the school - who checks the descriptions to ensure they fit the grades described in the inspection schedule			1
' inspectors just cut and paste , regurgitating wording from the evaluation schedule			0
therefore the reports are often more similar than they are individual			0
