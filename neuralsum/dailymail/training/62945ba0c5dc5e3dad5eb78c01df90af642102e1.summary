meet your new bosses : @entity0 is looking to recruit a skilled manager to run its faltering illegal oil business up to now jihadists have run their newly - acquired business through intimidation - threatening to kill employees ' families if they fail to comply			2

the refineries manager position is the most senior of several vacancies that the terror group is hoping to fill			1
oil workers in @entity8 say black market agents have been spreading the word through jihadist networks - casting their net as far afield as north @entity41			1
@entity42 , at @entity43 , a consultancy firm in @entity45 , has confirmed the reports but believes @entity0 will struggle to attract the best staff with the pay packet they are offering			0

a western oil exec posted to @entity8 right now , let alone working for @entity0 , would expect to earn a lot more than that			2
' biggest source of wealth : a pro-militant social media account put out this picture of smoke rising after an attack by @entity0 on the country 's largest oil refinery in @entity62 in june and officials at @entity8 's @entity64 , which has lost one field to @entity0 , said : ' with each round of fighting , more staff drift away			2

no one wants to touch it			0
' what that means is that the vast majority of the group 's oil sales is going to so - called ' middlemen '			0
these are people who own their own tanker trucks and who have connections to established smuggling networks in northern @entity9 and southern @entity101 , or to local refineries in places like @entity9 , @entity8 , @entity104 and @entity101			1
under threat : @entity8 security forces said they advanced to within one mile of the city of @entity62 this week in a new offensive to retake the country 's biggest oil refinery mr @entity77 adds : ' they 're relying on very small transactions and a lot of them in order to move the oil because they 're selling it by tanker truck more often than not			2
' and a tanker truck ca n't hold that much oil			0
