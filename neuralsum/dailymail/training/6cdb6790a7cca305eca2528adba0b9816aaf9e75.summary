by @entity0 published : 19:59 est , 29 june 2012 updated : 20:40 est , 29 june 2012 inspirational paratrooper @entity1 , 27 , is the most injured @entity3 servicemen to have survived after he lost both his limbs and broke his back , hips and ribs when his @entity8 hit a mine in @entity10 in 2006			1
doctors believed he would n't be able to recover from such serious wounds - 37 in total - but thanks to his sheer determination @entity15 has proved them all wrong with his amazing progress			1
but his mother @entity17 , who refused to give up on him , today reveals how she faced an up - hill battle to get @entity15 the help he needed from the @entity20 to aid his path to recovery			1
@entity17 , pictured with @entity15 on @entity23 , said her son @entity15 has made unbelievable progress and his memory is returning @entity15 spent four months in a coma that experts thought he would never awake from but when he miraculously did revive @entity17 claims the @entity20 were just concerned about the cost of his rehabilitation			1
under the advice of a surgeon , @entity15 underwent surgery so he would be able to sit in a wheelchair , but at the same time was discharged from the army hospital at @entity36 with no carers or help provided for him at home			1
she told the @entity42 newspaper : ' they saved his life but they would rather him die than pay for him to recover			1
people were saying that @entity36 was being blocked by people who could n't be rehabilitated			1
' i suppose our view of the @entity20 is that there is very little care for the soldier as a person			2
the soldiers lives have never been worth a great deal			2
' @entity55 , @entity56 , 27 , the most seriously wounded soldier to survive the war in @entity10 , as he carries the @entity58 through his home town of @entity60 amazing spirit : thousands of people lined the streets of @entity60 to show their support to the torch relay 's bravest participant as paratroopers from @entity15 's regiment supported him all the way it was while @entity15 was still in a coma that @entity17 said she received an ' invoice ' of @entity15 's compensation for his injuries amounting to just £ 152,000			1
after consulting a solicitor she managed to force a judicial review to fight the compensation scheme			2
@entity15 's compensation is now capped at the @entity80 limit of £ 570,000			2
she added : ' we were able to fight the system			2
and @entity15 has forced the way so the same thing never happens to another boy			2
' @entity17 added that the @entity20 is very separate to the soldiers and their regiments			2
while soldiers are very loyal to eachother , the army , queen and country , they are not loyal to the @entity20 who just see them as a ' commodity '			0
@entity15 suffered a total of 37 terrible injuries when he was blown up by a landmine			1
he lost both his legs and sustained grievous damage to his spine , skull , pelvis , hands , spleen and ribcage , leaving him in a coma for months @entity15 was just 22 when he was thrown 30 metres from a @entity8 from the blast of a 30 - year - old @entity111 anti-tank mine in @entity10			1
he landed on his head causing severe brain injury while his legs were crushed , his pelvis broken as well as his arms , hand and fingers and his jaw was fractured			1
despite all of this , he has fought an ongoing battle over the last six years to regain his memory and overcome his injuries			1
this culminated last week with @entity15 carrying the @entity58 torch for 300 metres - taking 27 painful and exhausting minutes			0
he was determined to do it on his new prosthetic legs , scoffing at the offer to be pushed in a wheelchair or use crutches			1
proud paratroopers from @entity15 's regiment , the 7th @entity133 unit , supported him all the way			0
few who saw @entity15 could fail to have been inspired by his strength of character as he walked slowly by the cenotaph in his home town of @entity60			0
speaking on the day , he said : ' i am very proud			0
i did n’t realise how much support i had , i was amazed			0
’ his mother @entity17 added : ‘ i cried from start to finish			0
people were shouting and cheering			0
i could n’t believe so many had turned out			0
' it 's the proudest moment of my life			0
we knew @entity15 would complete the route			0
' @entity15 was accompanied by 25 colleagues from 7 @entity152 and his commanding officer @entity153 said : ‘ my men would have crawled over broken glass to be here today to show @entity15 our support			0
' everyone in the regiment is tremendously proud of the progress that he 's made against incredible adversity			0
' we 're immensely proud of the physical and mental courage he shows in overcoming major injuries			1
it 's nothing short of awe - inspiring			0
