by @entity0 @entity2 's mother - in - law has been earning a six - figure salary from her role heading a charity intended to help women in political campaigns abroad			1
@entity10 , the mother of @entity12 's husband @entity11 , is a @entity13 currently running for @entity14 in @entity15 and the financial statements for her charity , women 's @entity8 ( @entity9 ) , have come under scrutiny as such			1
as the charity has grown over the past decade , so has her salary as @entity20 reports it has steadily increased from $ 54,962 in 2002 to the highest point in 2011 when she took home $ 164,159			2
connections : @entity10 , a former congresswoman who is currently running to get back into politics , presented her daughter - in - law @entity2 with an award last month on behalf of her charity her salary dipped last year - to $ 109,678 in 2012 - and she has not taken any salary this year			1
instead , the former @entity10 , who served one term before being voted out in 1995 , has turned her attention back to the political arena as she is now actively campaigning in her own tight race against three other @entity31			2
that is n't to say that she has cut ties to the charity , as she regularly posts updates on her @entity37 account , publicizing events that they are holding			0
one such recent evening came in november when she honored her famous daughter - in - law at the 15th anniversary bash for the charity			2
' thrilled to be honored last night by women 's @entity8 & even more grateful for the work they do around the world , ' @entity12 wrote to her @entity37 followers			0
that work includes programs focused on conflict mitigation , economic empowerment and political participation in @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 respectively			1
like many charities , fundraising efforts for @entity9 ebb and flow along the lines of economic prosperity , meaning that the annual budget for the charity is variable year to year			0
back in the race : @entity10 , the mother of @entity2 's husband @entity11 , is running for a seat in @entity14 to represent a district of @entity67 that helps explain some of the spikes and dips in ms @entity10 ' salary , but the @entity20 points to the fact that even in their more economically - prosperous years , her take - home pay would have been a slightly higher than average percentage of the group 's expenses than standard throughout the industry			1
ms @entity10 ' spokesman @entity79 responded to their article after publication , defending her pay over time and saying that she was paid less than the industry average for heads of non-profits - which is thought to be $ 94,924 - when looking at her pay over the past decade rather than the past few years			1
' the vote ' : back in 1993 , hers was one of the deciding votes that passed then - president @entity92 's budget plan that increased taxes for the wealthy , and that caused her to be voted out ' for six of the twelve years @entity10 has been leading @entity9 , her salary has been significantly lower than the industry standard			1
in 2013 @entity10 has , in fact , taken no salary at all , ' he wrote to @entity20			2
he blasted the reporter , @entity100 , for ' creating the false impression that marjorie has somehow used wci to line her pockets '			0
adding to the fundraising climates in particular years , the @entity9 also receives grants - the budgets for which are at the whims of their own ties to the economy			0
' some years we are implementing multiple grants and all efforts are on program implementation and other times our staff efforts are on fundraising and proposal writing to secure more funding for projects			0
one of those grants - for $ 127,076 - came directly from the @entity123 in 2011			0
that hefty grant comes as little surprise to political watchers , as ms @entity10 had a significant connection to the @entity123 at the time , and one who is a very big proponent of female empowerment work abroad : @entity132 , her son 's mother - in - law , was the secretary of state at the time			1
now that connection may be problematic for @entity92 should she take her widely - predicted role as the @entity31 presidential candidate in 2016 , as more questions will be raised about what portion of @entity9 's funding actually goes towards the programs they tout			0
@entity141 's efforts to reach out to ms @entity10 ' campaign and @entity9 were not immediately returned			1
in addition to her work with the @entity9 , ms @entity10 teaches at the @entity146			1
head scratcher : @entity11 , seen here with former president clinton , first met @entity12 at a @entity31 conference in the 1990s			0
both his mother and father , who later went on to jail , were in @entity14 at the time she first ran for @entity14 in 1992 , when she was known as @entity10 and was married to former @entity155 representative @entity154 , an @entity156 @entity13 who went on to become the party 's state chairman in @entity15			1
he went to prison in 2003 after he plead guilty to 31 out of 69 counts of bank , mail and wire fraud where he defrauded investors of $ 10million			0
embarrassment of the in - laws : @entity154 went to prison in 2003 after he plead guilty to 31 out of 69 counts of bank , mail and wire fraud where he defrauded investors of $ 10million she stood by him for the first four years of his federal prison sentence before divorcing him in 2007 , just one year before he was released			0
@entity10 , who is now 71 years old , made a name for herself on a number of different fronts before her husband went to prison and decades before her son married a first daughter			2
she was the first single @entity155 woman to adopt a foreign child , an experience that became the subject of her first book			0
and on august 5 , 1993 , during her term in @entity14 , @entity10 cast one of the two final votes that gave @entity92 's budget a dramatic victory in the @entity190 , 218 - 216			1
just hours before she voted , she told a reporter she would oppose the bill , but she changed her mind after a phone call with @entity92 minutes before the vote			0
her 1994 challenger , @entity196 , focused his campaign rhetoric on that decision , and voters in the wealthy district turned against her			0
in 2010 , her son @entity11 married @entity2 and she said that she was very happy for the couple , who began dating five years earlier after meeting at a @entity31 political retreat in @entity205 in 1993			1
‘ i ’m totally delighted to be @entity2 ’s mother - in - law ; she ’s a doll , ’ she said at the time .			2

@entity10 is the mother of @entity11 , who is married to @entity2
ms @entity10 is the founder of a charity called @entity212 which helps empower women in @entity54 , @entity53 and @entity52
over the past five years , she has given herself a six - figure salary which is higher than the average pay for heads of non-profits
in 2013 , however , she has not taken any salary as she is now running for the @entity14 seat she once held
