@entity0 looked up , noticed @entity1 was off his line , and thought : ‘ why not ? ’ why not , indeed			1
the @entity4 midfielder was 66 yards from goal but had the audacity to score what will surely be crowned the @entity9 ’s strike of the season			1
@entity11 did it against @entity13 in august 1996 , as did @entity14 against @entity15 last march			1
there was @entity17 in 2006 and @entity18 three years later , too			1
@entity0 ( centre ) lets fly from inside his own half as he scores one of the goals of his career at @entity24 @entity1 watches on as he is unable to stop @entity0 's shot from hitting the back of the net for 1 - 1 yet this was different			1
it was not a hit and hope			0
it was not a lob			0
this was a direct shot from deep inside @entity0 ’s own half which fooled one of the world ’s greatest goalkeepers — and @entity0 meant it			1
‘ this is better than @entity11 , more audacious than @entity14 ’s last season , this is one of the best strikes we ’ve ever seen			1
it ’s an absolutely incredible piece of play by @entity0			1
‘ you categorise goals as great individual efforts or team goals , but that was a piece of genius			0
to even try it is brilliant			0
’ even by the standards those at @entity58 are used to seeing week in , week out , this was special			0
particularly because it came from an unexpected source , from a ‘ bloke who looks like a bus driver ’ , as former @entity65 cricket captain @entity64 colourfully put it			0
nineteen years ago , when @entity11 introduced himself to the world with his goal from the halfway line , he did so wearing the wrong footwear			1
the @entity72 great beat @entity13 goalkeeper @entity73 wearing custom - made boots embroidered with ‘ @entity0 ’ on the tongue — adidas sending @entity11 a pair which were actually intended for @entity78 attacking midfielder @entity79			1
@entity0 ( second left ) admitted he had mixed emotions after scoring the goal but losing the game @entity11 struck from inside his own half for @entity72 against @entity13 in 1996 @entity11 celebrated the final goal in 3 - 0 win for @entity72 on the opening day of the 1996 - 97 season @entity24 became the second team to score 100 penalties in the @entity9			1
@entity90 were the first and have now scored 102			0
@entity79 never got his boots as they were retired , turned into a museum piece , having helped @entity11 towards his first of 115 @entity65 caps less than three weeks later against @entity94			1
from one @entity95 @entity0 to another , @entity0 plans to frame his boots and shirt from @entity58 , but this goal is unlikely to be the making of the @entity78 , @entity101 and @entity90 midfielder as it was for @entity11			1
yet in the four seconds it took for the ball to go from boot to net , @entity0 disproved the theory that sequels are never better than the original			2
‘ the manager kept saying to me , “ come in the middle of the pitch ” , to try to get on the ball , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ i ’m not a winger , i ’m not a wide left midfielder , i do n’t have the pace to go in behind so i ’ve seen an opening , i ’ve seen the goalie off his line and i thought , “ why not do it at a place like @entity24 ? ” ' i ’ve seen the goalie back - pedalling and i was praying it would go in			2
i ’ll remember it for the rest of my career			0
’ from @entity130 ’s marca to @entity132 ’s @entity131 , the goal has been admired worldwide			0
one man who does not want to see it again , however , is @entity135			2
it left a black mark against a win which moved them seven points clear at the top of the @entity9 , yet even the @entity24 manager can admire a wonder - goal when one comes along , as much as it hurts to admit it			1
even @entity24 boss @entity135 had to admit that @entity0 's goal was a strike of the highest quality @entity0 ( right ) celebrates with his @entity4 team - mates after scoring at @entity58 on saturday ‘ it was a fantastic goal , every player in the world would like to score a goal like that , ’ @entity135 said			1
‘ @entity155 to @entity156 to all these brilliant players			0
not all of them did score that goal in their careers			0
’ @entity155 , @entity156 , and @entity0			2
unlike the @entity163 greats , he is known more for his heavy tackling , as @entity165 found out when he suffered ankle ligament damage in may 2011			0
yet this was straight from the @entity169 playbook			0
@entity4 had not managed a single shot on target with half - time minutes away and there seemed no danger as @entity0 picked up the ball 10 yards inside his own half			2
@entity1 mistakenly thought the same			0
yet this is nothing new from @entity0			2
he did it for @entity101 reserves previously , and @entity180 , too			0
asked if it is something he thinks about using regularly during a game , @entity0 said : ‘ every time			2
’ @entity184 through this interview , @entity24 striker @entity183 interrupts			2
‘ why ? ’ he asks @entity0 in mock indignation			0
‘ tell me why ? ’ to which @entity0 replies : ‘ i watch your videos			0
’ indeed there are compilations of goals just as outrageous on @entity193 and , on saturday , @entity0 rightly earned his place in history among them .			1

@entity0 scored *remarkable* goal in *defeat* to league *leaders*
even @entity24 boss @entity135 full of praise for @entity0 's strike
@entity0 's goal compared to @entity11 and @entity17 goals
