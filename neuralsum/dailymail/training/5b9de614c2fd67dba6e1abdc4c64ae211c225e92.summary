@entity0 is having his best ever start to a season - but the @entity2 playmaker still does n't even rank himself among the top five players in the world			1
the 23 - year - old has starred in @entity2 's impressive opening to the new @entity8 campaign , and was chosen as man of the match in their recent @entity12 derby against @entity13			1
but @entity0 is not completely happy - and says he needs to be decisive in every game to match the players he ranks as the top five in the world			1
' maybe i 'm close to it , but i still have to work on some aspects			0
you can only be part of that group if you are decisive in the top games			2
i ( have started ) doing that , like i did against @entity47 and @entity13			1
' who are better than me ? the two extra-terrestrials , ( @entity34 ) @entity34 and ( @entity35 ) @entity35 , ( @entity36 ) @entity36 , ( @entity37 ) @entity37 and ( @entity38 ) @entity38			0
they make the difference almost every game			0
' after powering @entity2 's title campaign for much of last season , @entity0 ended up taking the brunt of criticism from manager @entity57 for his supposed laziness in midfield , something that @entity57 blamed for the club 's @entity61 semi-final exit to @entity63			1
hazard ranks @entity34 as one of two ' extra-terrestrials ' - making him one of the world 's best and @entity35 was also put into that category by @entity0 for his work with @entity70 and @entity71 but @entity0 says all that is behind the pair with @entity2 's star man and manager both happy with a start that has put them five points clear at the top of the @entity8 after just seven games			1
' maybe this has been the best start in my career so far , although it is n't reflected in the stats , ' he added in an interview with @entity87			2
' i have played only one bad game - against @entity89			0
i 've taken a good rest during my holiday , i had a short , but good pre-season and i feel really well			0
' @entity57 and i get along well			0
i 've lots of respect for him			0
he gives me a lot of confidence			0
after a bad game he dares to say , " we have played with 10 today " , but that 's it			2
at moments like that he leaves me alone			0
' on saturday hazard and @entity2 travel to @entity105 - a side that the @entity28 failed to break down last season as the @entity108 lost 1 - 0 at @entity110 courtesy of a @entity112 own goal			1
hazard will hope to be ' decisive ' at the other end of the pitch to keep the pack chasing at the top of the league			2
@entity36 was the third player named by @entity0 despite playing in what he calls a lesser league @entity120 's @entity37 and @entity38 ( right ) also made @entity0 's list of five top players after a difficult end to last season the @entity123 is looking forward to pushing on under @entity57			1

@entity2 's @entity28 playmaker ranks his start to the season as his best ever
@entity0 picked up the man of the match *award* against @entity13
he has been in fine form as @entity2 moved to the top of @entity8
but he thinks there are at least five players better than him in the world
