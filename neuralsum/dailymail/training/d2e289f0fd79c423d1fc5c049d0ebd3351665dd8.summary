by @entity0 you might think that the creation of a new alien belongs within the pages of a science fiction novel			0
but a replicating ‘ alien ’ life - form has been made by scientists who introduced dna molecules not found in nature to a common bacterium			1
the e. coli bugs are able to grow and reproduce as normal despite containing two extra letters in their genetic code			1
in future , the research could lead to creation of microbes capable of manufacturing entirely new proteins , which could prove lead to new medicines and nanotechnology			1
it 's life , but not quite as we know it : a replicating ' alien ' life - form has been made by scientists who introduced dna molecules not found in nature to a common bacterium ( stock image )			1
the e. coli bugs are able to grow and reproduce as normal despite containing two extra letters in their genetic code however , some people are worried that the rapid advance of ‘ synthetic biology ’ could lead to the worrying prospect of new life - forms escaping from the laboratory with unpredictable consequences			1
nature ’s genetic code consists of a dna alphabet of just four ‘ letters ’ - adenine ( a ) , cytosine ( c ) , guanine ( @entity43 ) and thymine ( @entity45 )			1
an additional letter , uracil ( @entity48 ) , is found in @entity39 ’s close cousin molecule , @entity49			0
the @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity43 and @entity45 building blocks form ‘ base pair ’ partnerships whose sequences make up all life forms			2
‘ @entity58 in all its diversity is encoded by only two pairs of dna bases , @entity62 and @entity43 , and what we ’ve made is an organism that stably contains those two plus a third , unnatural pair of bases , ’ lead scientist dr @entity66 , from the @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity71 , said			1
‘ this shows that other solutions to storing information are possible and of course , takes us closer to an expanded - @entity39 biology that will have many exciting applications - from new medicines to new kinds of nanotechnology			2
’ the work , reported in the journal nature , involved overcoming a billion years of evolution to get the expanded genetic alphabet into living bacteria			1
' @entity58 in all its diversity is encoded by only two pairs of dna bases , @entity62 and @entity43 , and what we 've made is an organism that stably contains those two plus a third , unnatural pair of bases , ' lead scientist dr @entity66 , from the @entity69 said			2
an illustration of a @entity39 molecule is pictured it started in 2008 when dr @entity66 ’s team of researchers succeeded in replicating unnatural base pairs in a test tube			0
they also managed to transcribe the semi-synthetic dna into @entity49 - a first step towards translating a new genetic code into a protein			1
but performing the same trick in the complex environment of a living cell presented much greater challenges			0
to solve the problem the scientists first added the artificial base pair molecules - @entity109 and @entity111 - to a fluid solution outside the cell			2
then they used a special transporter molecule , made by a species of micro-algae , to import them into the bacteria			0
the team first replicated unnatural base pairs in a test tube and transcribed semi-synthetic dna into @entity49 - the first step in translating a new genetic code into a protein			1
they then added artificial base pair molecules to a fluid solution outside the cell , before using a special transporter molecule to import them into the bacteria			2
using this technique , the scientists were able to synthesise circular loops of dna known as plasmids and insert them into @entity134			0
although the plasmids were separate from the organism ’s integral chromosomal dna , they became part of its replicating genetic material			0
the team were pleasantly surprised when the semi-synthetic plasmids did n't hamper the growth or reproduction of the bacteria			0
‘ that was a big breakthrough for us - an enabling breakthrough , ’ said co-author dr @entity146 , also from the @entity69			1
the scientists were able to synthesise circular loops of dna known as plasmids and insert them into @entity134			0
the plasmid dna contained natural a-t and @entity43 base pairs together with a @entity156 - @entity155 base pair			0
although the plasmids were separate from the organism ’s integral chromosomal dna , they became part of its replicating genetic material			0
to the surprise of the team , the semi-synthetic plasmids did not hamper the growth of the @entity134 bacteria to any great extent			0
nor did they show any sign of shedding their artificial components			0
the next step will be to demonstrate that unnatural dna within bacteria can be transcribed into the @entity49 molecules that feed genetic instructions to protein - making machinery in cells			1
‘ in principle , we could encode new proteins made from new , unnatural amino acids , which would give us greater power than ever to tailor protein therapeutics and diagnostics and laboratory reagents to have desired functions , ’ said dr @entity66			2
‘ other applications , such as nanomaterials , are also possible			0
’ commenting on the research in a nature article , @entity193 and @entity194 , from the @entity195 , wrote : ‘ if the technique ... works for other pairs , then the dna code could be extended well beyond three base pairs			1
‘ this raises fundamental questions about why life settled on only two in the first place , and whether semi-synthetic organisms with the capacity to store more information will have expanded capabilities or endure intolerable fitness costs			2
’ ‘ attempts to expand the genetic alphabet bravely question the idea of the universal nature of @entity39 , and potentially draw criticism about the wisdom of tinkering with it , ' they added .			1
