@entity1 's chief executive @entity0 has revealed the firm has outgrown its original mission statement and is in ' uncharted territory			1
' the search giant claimed to ' organise the world 's information and make it universally accessible and useful ' when it first launch in 1998 along with the famous mantra ' do n't be evil '			1
now , @entity0 admits he is n't sure what the firm 's goals are			1
questioned by @entity16 , @entity0 said : ' we 're in a bit of uncharted territory			1
we 're trying to figure it out			2
' how do we use all these resources … and have a much more positive impact on the world ? ' in recent years , the firm has expanded into everything from driverless cars to flying drones and smart contact lenses			2
however , it has also faced anti-monopoly probes by the @entity32 commission and most recently pressure from @entity32 over the ' right to be forgotten '			0
this ruling forced @entity1 to remove search listings to information deemed to be outdated and not in the public interest which saw @entity39 request over 60,000 links be deleted by october			1
the firm last week revealed a plan to take on cancer with smart nanoparticles			1
nanoparticles could be ingested in a pill to enter the bloodstream			0
they would be designed to bind to a particular type of cell – like a cancer tumor cell			0
this would be done by ' painting ' them with a substance that could interact with the surface of cells			0
they 'd then travel together as a unit through the bloodstream			0
the core of the nanoparticles would be magnetic , so a wearable device that creates a magnetic field could draw the particles – with their target cells in tow – toward it , where they could be detected and counted			0
experts at @entity1 are studying various non-invasive techniques , like light and radio waves , for detecting and counting the particles			1
he says the firm 's secretive [ x ] lab has meant is can do work nobody else can			1
it has already developed a smart contact lens			0
it works using tiny sensors and microchips fitted into contact lenses that can then measure and read the amount of glucose in tears , before sending the information to a mobile device so diabetics can manage their condition			0
' we do benefit from the fact that once we say we 're going to do it , people believe we can do it , because we have the resources , ' said @entity0			1
' @entity1 helps in that way : there are n't many funding mechanisms like that			1
' @entity0 also criticised the current boom which say investors throwing money and startups with little chance of changing the world			2
a @entity1 smart contact lens that can monitor the glucose levels in the eye is being developed in a partnership with @entity112 pharmaceutical company @entity111			2
it works using tiny sensors and microchips fitted into contact lenses that can then measure and read the amount of glucose in tears , before sending the information to a mobile device so diabetics can manage their condition			0
he estimates that only about 50 investors are chasing the real breakthrough technologies that have the potential to make a material difference to the lives of most people on earth			0
@entity1 has unprecedented resources brought about by its search and web advertising dominance , which has seen countries become uneasy in the face of a company that wields so much influence over a universal resource such as the internet .			2
