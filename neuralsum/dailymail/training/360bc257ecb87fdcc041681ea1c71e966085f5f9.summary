by @entity0 for @entity1 a pair of friends who dreamt up @entity5 - themed board games during drunken dinners together have told how they won £ 50,000 backing from the @entity9 investment show			1
father of two @entity11 , 48 , and his friend @entity12 , 51 , dreamt up a series of board games including @entity15 and who put the @entity5 in @entity17 , over long evenings spent playing games and drinking wine			1
they won permission to use the name @entity5 from brand owner , @entity25 , before going onto @entity9 to ask for funding			1
but the pair , who have been friends since childhood when they lived across a glen from each other in @entity32 , nearly lost their chance when they were n't allowed to mention the name @entity5 to the inquisitive @entity9			1
' they did n't want any mention of it til it was signed off , so we were worried the @entity9 would n't be interested			2
' three @entity9 took their money off the table early , leaving @entity37 and @entity39 demanding to know more			1
mr @entity11 said : ' we told them we could n't say the name but it was an iconic brand and a well - known supermarket brand			0
' eventually they demanded to see paperwork and when we showed it to them , @entity39 said " oh it 's @entity5 " , and they agreed to invest			1
@entity39 and @entity37 said they would buy a 40 per cent stake in the men 's games start - up , @entity70 , and the games will go on sale next month			1
@entity78 , the title of which is based on the idea that @entity5 provokes strong reactions one way or the other , is a game in which couples and friends can find out how much they know about each other			0
inventor and board games enthusiast @entity11 , 48 , with some of the games he has dreamed up the idea for who put the @entity5 in @entity17 came to mr @entity11 when he realised that his @entity43 wife was putting the @entity5 in the fridge , meaning it was unspreadable on his toast every morning			1
he said : ' my wife always puts it in the fridge which makes it like concrete , and now my children do the same thing , and every morning i ask the same thing			0
' it occurred to me it would be a great name for a board game			2
' he and mr @entity107 developed their ideas for games in a series of dinners over the years , but only decided to launch their business in 2009 after the property market crashed and mr @entity11 needed a new job			2
first they came up with @entity119 , in which players try to persuade their opponents to believe made - up facts , and @entity124 , a modern version of @entity126 in which players translate from one language to another and another			0
in who put the @entity5 in @entity17 , players have to avoid being left with the jar of @entity5			0
mr @entity11 and his childhood friend mr @entity107 , right , spent many nights playing board games mr @entity11 and mr @entity107 , an accountant by trade who moved from @entity139 to southern @entity140 , have now had their games snapped up by shops including @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147			2
they appeared on @entity9 last night , and said their preconceptions about the @entity9 were shattered after meeting them			0
' we thought we 'd really like @entity151 and @entity152 but in fact we thought @entity151 was quite dull and @entity152 was a little bit rude and dismissive , ' mr @entity11 said			0
' @entity154 was a surprise , as we thought she would be hard - nosed when in fact she was absolutely delightful - so lovely			0
' we thought @entity39 would be fun , which he was , and we thought @entity37 would be a hard task - master , when in fact he was lovely - we are so pleased to be working with those two			2
' they 're both great to work with and a really good laugh , too			0

@entity11 , 48 , and @entity12 , 51 , invented games
won permission from @entity5 owner @entity25 to use its name and image
then they went on investment tv show to ask for funding from the @entity9
but @entity25 contract said *entrepreneurs* could n't mention name @entity5
three @entity9 *pulled* out , but @entity39 and @entity37 agreed
they paid the men £ 50,000 for a 40 per cent stake in board game business
