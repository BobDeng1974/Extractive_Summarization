by @entity0 published : 11:03 est , 17 july 2012 updated : 13:47 est , 17 july 2012 angry taxi drivers caused major disruption on @entity4 's roads today in a protest over their ban from dedicated @entity8 traffic lanes			1
tourists in @entity10 were greeted with blaring horns as more than 200 black cabs arrived shortly before 2pm			1
the demonstration was organised as pictures revealed that markings on the controversial lanes are already becoming worn - 10 days before the @entity17 begin			1
standstill : taxi drivers stopped their vehicles in the road outside the @entity22 the route in @entity24 was only painted a week ago , but already the markings are beginning to fade outside the @entity26			1
use of the lanes will be restricted to @entity8 officials , athletes and other approved vehicles			1
the routes have been nicknamed ‘ zil lanes ’ after the limousines used to ferry communist leaders in specially reserved lanes from the @entity36 during the @entity38 era in @entity39			2
restrictions do not come into force in central @entity43 until july 25 , but taxi drivers have already made their grievances known			2
fading out : markings on the @entity8 lane in @entity24 , @entity43 , are already becoming worn embarrassing : paint on the @entity17 lane on @entity24 is already coming away patchy : painting on the route was only completed by workmen a week ago @entity54 , of the @entity56 group union , said : ' there will be no access to these lanes for any traffic apart from the @entity8 family			1
' taxis are excluded , which is unacceptable and wrong			0
this is a working city and we need to get around and do our job			0
' a key road junction on access routes to the @entity8 mountain biking course will not be completed in time for the @entity17			1
roadworks have overrun for almost two months at @entity71 , where visitors are expected to travel on their way to the course at @entity75 in @entity76			0
some 40,000 spectators are expected to attend the mountain biking events and contractors had hoped to complete the @entity8 improvement works at the junction in @entity82 , @entity76 , in time			0
but councillors have decided to abandon the work to avoid huge tailbacks during the competitions			0
the junction links two key routes of @entity43 - the @entity88 and the @entity89			0
a spokesman for @entity91 said : ' following the @entity8 , contractors will need to return in september to carry out final works			0
mr @entity54 dismissed as ' complete rubbish ' claims @entity43 athletes would be delayed and potentially miss events without the dedicated lanes			1
he said officials ' ' modelling was all wrong '			0
he said he hoped up to 1,000 cabbies would take part in a demonstration in the square this evening , which could affect rush - hour traffic			0
@entity105 said the taxi protest was ' completely irresponsible '			2
@entity107 , the transport body 's director of taxi and private hire , said : ' we have worked tirelessly with groups that represent the majority of hard working taxi drivers to provide cabbies with as much access to the lanes as possible			1
' through dialogue which started in 2009 , @entity105 has secured concessions specifically for taxi drivers , including the use of turns along the olympic route network that were initially banned for all traffic except buses , as well as access to a number of kerbside games lanes to pick up passengers			1
' we have informed taxi drivers that any such demonstration is completely irresponsible and would only disrupt the travelling public - the very people taxi drivers are supposed to serve			2
' we strongly urge taxi drivers to ignore calls to join these unnecessary protests and instead show why they are regularly voted the best in the world			1
' a @entity139 spokeswoman said officers were aware of the protest and put in place ' an appropriate policing plan '			0
demonstration : taxi drivers park in @entity10 in protest at their ban from @entity8 lanes defiant : a driver ( left ) holds his arm aloft to show his opposition to the @entity8 lane while a fellow protester ( right ) gets out to read a newspaper as the roads remain gridlocked making themselves heard : cabbies blew their horns at bemused tourists during the protest in @entity10 not moving : a taxi driver leans out of his window as he sits in a queue during the protest concerns : an official from the @entity168 union approaches members taking action against the traffic restrictions the protest happened only a day after the opening of the first @entity17 lane - between junctions 3 and 2 on the @entity176			1
its introduction caused confusion for commuters travelling on approach roads into @entity43			0
drivers faced long tailbacks as many struggled to understand if they could use the freshly painted lanes or not			2
a @entity187 poll has found that , with the opening ceremony only 10 days away , more than half of @entity189 have made no alternative travel plans for the @entity17			2
the research , commissioned by used car website @entity193 , suggested that many commuters had paid little attention to publicity campaigns			0
bold display : a driver gets out of his car in front of the @entity203 clock tower going nowhere : a policeman liaises with a driver while taxis block the road fifty - six per cent of respondents said they had not changed their plans			0
and more than half of @entity212 and @entity213 users surveyed said the high - profile taxpayer - funded get ahead of the @entity17 campaign had made no difference to them			2
@entity219 , commercial director of @entity193 , said : ' while @entity189 are undoubtedly excited about the @entity8 , the results reflect that chaos may be looming , as many are unconvinced by the city ’s ability to handle additional volumes of people on public transport and roads			0
' @entity43 ’s public transport and road systems are likely to be hubs of bedlam in the coming weeks , as commuters and tourists try to go from a to @entity234 move along , please : a police officer directs taxi drivers taking part in the @entity4 demonstration criticism : @entity105 described the protest as ' completely irresponsible '			1
