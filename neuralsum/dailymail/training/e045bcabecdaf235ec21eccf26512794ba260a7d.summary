by @entity0 and @entity1 tourism leaders in @entity3 want to sue the producers of @entity5 ' claiming the latest episode was full of ' lies ' and wrongly depicts @entity7 as harbouring terrorists			1
@entity3 tourism minister @entity9 is so upset about the show 's ' damaging ' portrayal of the city that he is consulting lawyers			1
@entity9 said the episode wrongly depicted the city as a strong - hold for terrorists and a place where foreigners can easily fall victim to random attacks			1
however his comments have now been overshadowed by a car bomb which rocked the city this afternoon			1
at least eight people have been killed and an estimated 80 people wounded in the worst blast seen in the city for years			2
scroll down to see video of the aftermath @entity28 links : the foiled terrorist plot is thought to have originated from @entity28 - in chilling echoes of the devastating explosion in @entity32 , east @entity7 , pictured , carnage : @entity34 worked with @entity35 and regularly came under fire to resign from the @entity38 - led opposition since october of last year , when a car bomb exploded in @entity7 @entity3 @entity41 personnel are seen at the site : cars and buildings were wrecked in the attack which left ten dead a @entity3 men evacuates a wounded woman from the scene : this is the first such attack in the @entity3 capital since 2008 the attack reportedly occurred as parents picked their children up from school			1
reporters at the scene described seeing bloodied victims being loaded in ambulances and heavy damage to residential buildings			0
the motive for the car - bomb is not immediately clear			1
however it comes at a time when @entity3 has seen a rise in tension and eruptions of clashes stemming from the civil war in neighboring @entity28			1
in scenes reminiscent of the dark days of @entity3 's civil war , ambulances ferried the wounded to several hospitals , where doctors , nurses and students waited for casualties at the doors - meanwhile the hospitals put out an appeal for blood donations			1
an employee of a bank on the street pointed to the blown - out windows of his building			2
' some people were wounded from my bank			0
i think it was a car bomb			1
the whole car jumped five floors into the air , ' he said			2
a firefighter extinguishes flames at the scene of devastation , which has left at least eight people dead a man runs past a burning car at the scene , as fire crews try to secure buildings damaged in the blast scene of the explosion : the fronts of buildings have been torn off as people gather in the aftermath of the attack injuries : wounded @entity3 civilians are rushed from the scene following the explosion @entity117 , 25 , a @entity118 musician visiting @entity7 , said he was in his hotel a street away when the explosion happened			1
' at first i thought it was an earthquake			0
it shook the whole hotel for a second			0
i ran down and started filming on my @entity127			0
' the bomb exploded in the street where the office of the @entity131 is located			2
it was not immediately clear if the explosion targeted any political figure in @entity3 's divided community but it occurred at a time of heightened tension between @entity3 factions on opposite sides of the @entity28 conflict			1
ambulances rushed to the scene of the blast near @entity144 in @entity32 , a mostly @entity145 area , as smoke rose from the area			0
it occurred during rush hour , when many parents were picking up children from school			0
several cars were destroyed by the explosion and the front of a multi-storey building was badly damaged , with tangled wires and metal railings crashing to the ground			0
residents ran about in panic looking for relatives while others helped carry the wounded to ambulances , and security forces blanketed the area			0
horrific : a @entity3 rescue man carries an injured boy at the scene of a suspected car bomb in the mostly @entity145 neighborhood of @entity172 , @entity7 a @entity3 policeman uses his mobile phone to film damage at the scene a @entity3 forensic inspector investigates : the motive behind the attack is not yet known @entity3 tourism minister @entity9 complained about @entity181 's ' damaging ' portrayal of @entity7 - just before a car bomb rocked the city the war in neighbouring @entity28 , which has killed 30,000 people so far , has pitted mostly @entity38 insurgents against president @entity187 , who is from the @entity189 sect linked to @entity190			1
tension between @entity38 and @entity190 has been rumbling in @entity3 ever since the end of the 1975 - 1990 civil war but reignited after the @entity28 conflict erupted			1
in @entity196 , @entity28 information minister @entity195 told reporters : ' we condemn this terrorist explosion and all these explosions wherever they happen			2
' @entity203 leader @entity202 , a staunch opponent of @entity28 president @entity187 and a member of parliament , condemned the attack			0
' let the state protect the citizens			0
we will not accept any procrastination in this matter , we can not continue like that			0
we have been warning for a year			0
enough , ' said @entity202 , whose brother was assassinated in november 2006			0
the attack came just as the tourism minister mr @entity9 went on the offensive to try to revive the city 's reputation as the ' @entity219 ' he insisted the city was more secure than @entity221 or @entity222 and feared foreigners would be put off			1
controversial : @entity225 as @entity226 , right , and @entity227 as @entity228 in a scene from the second season of ' homeland , ' which has come under fire by tourism leaders in @entity7 for being ' damaging ' filming : the scene features @entity235 ( pictured ) aiming to take out a senior figure affiliated with @entity35 , which is portrayed as a movement allied with @entity238 in the series , in @entity240 , @entity7 mr @entity9 is particularly upset about the second episode of the @entity181 , which he says shows the city to be a ' non secure zone '			1
he said : ' this kind of film damages the image of @entity3 – it is not fair to us and it ’s not true , it is not portraying reality			1
' ' we want to take action , we want to write to the filmmakers and producers and demand an apology			1
' and we are planning to raise a lawsuit against the director and the producer ' , he told executive magazine			0
the award - winning show , based on the @entity263 series ' @entity261 , ' is about a @entity264 named @entity265 who was a pow for years in the @entity266			2
the federal government and the public see @entity265 as a war hero , but a @entity271 operative played by @entity225 believes he was turned by the enemy and is now a threat to the @entity274 in the episode ' @entity7 is @entity276 ' , which aired on @entity277 last sunday , @entity235 is aiming to take out a senior figure affiliated with @entity3 ’s @entity190 @entity35 organisation			1
the organisation is portrayed as a movement allied with @entity238 in the series			0
the scene is supposed to be set in @entity240 , @entity7 but mr @entity9 said the street is not violent and dirty but a lively , safe , neighbourhood packed with cafes , book shops and pubs			1
@entity240 in @entity7 where the controversial scene was supposed to be set - but it was portrayed as violent when mr @entity9 said it was actually lively and safe and packed with shops , bars and cafes during the 1960s @entity7 attracted international superstars who would party in the city 's seafront hotels			1
however this era was short - lived and ended when the civil war began in 1975			2
the city was ruled by militias and the city became divided between @entity145 and @entity300			2
it soon became known for its hostage - takings , suicide bombings and massacres			2
the @entity3 hostage crisis saw the kidnapping in @entity3 of 96 foreign hostages – mostly @entity274 and western @entity309 – between 1982 and 1992			1
among the @entity118 taken was @entity310 , who was set free in 1991 after more than five years in captivity , and @entity312 , who spent four years in solitary confinement			0
@entity314 continued to ravage the city , as did shelling from @entity263 fighter plans , and there were many thousands of deaths , but from 1991 the city began to rebuild itself			0
it 's now well on the road to being regarded as the most liberal and fun - loving major @entity324 cities			0
however , portrayal of @entity3 as swarming with guns is not unreasonable either			1
the country still has dozens of armed militias that still flourish , and an alarming number of private individuals have weapons in their homes			0
the biggest militia of all , @entity334 - backed @entity35 , has gained so much power and influence over the years that it 's now part of the government , wielding virtual veto power			0
@entity341 , which produces the @entity343 drama , has refused to comment			0
mr @entity9 is also concerned about the fact the @entity7 scenes were actually shot in @entity346 , the @entity263 metropolis about 150 miles south of @entity7			2
the two nations are technically at war			0
@entity349 , a popular mixed @entity351 and @entity324 neighbourhood of @entity346 , allowed the creators of ' homeland ' to present a plausible version of @entity7			0
@entity355 , a 60 - year - old housewife , said @entity263 should never stand in for @entity3			1
' it is very insulting			0
@entity263 invaded and occupied our country			0
' however , @entity359 , an engineering student at the @entity360 , said it was not a problem that @entity263 are portraying @entity3			2
he said @entity3 often play @entity263 characters in @entity3 soap operas			2
@entity365 , a childhood friend of @entity366 , the @entity263 co-creator of ' homeland , ' said the producers did n't have the option of shooting in @entity7 , where @entity366 and other @entity263 are not allowed to visit			0
many @entity3 can not forget the massive destruction @entity263 inflicted on @entity7 during the 1982 invasion when it succeeded in routing the @entity373 from the country			2
they resent the 18 - year occupation of south @entity3 that followed , and their leaders reject the existence of the jewish state			1
but to @entity263 , @entity3 has been a staging ground for missile strikes and other attacks on @entity263 , more than justifying the massive @entity263 operations there that have occurred in every decade since the 1970s			2
@entity384 , a spokesman for @entity346 's mayor , said the @entity3 should be pleased at the tv show 's choice for a stand - in			1
' if i were @entity3 , with all due respect , i 'd be very flattered that a city , and a world heritage site , thanks to its incredible architecture , and residents who were named among the top 10 most beautiful people in the world ( ranked by @entity397 in 2012 ) could pass as @entity3 , ' he said .			1

@entity3 tourism minister @entity9 is consulting lawyers about legal action and is demanding an apology from producers
he said the latest episode wrongly depicted the city as strong - hold for terrorists and a place where foreigners are attacked
