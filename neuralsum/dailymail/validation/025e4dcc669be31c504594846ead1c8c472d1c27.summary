@entity1 ’s @entity0 said the country ’s top mandarin , sir @entity4 , had been ‘ wrong in law ’ during a row over two of @entity8 ’s special advisers sir @entity4 was given a humiliating rebuke by @entity11 yesterday for clearing taxpayer - funded advisers to take part in political campaigning			1
@entity1 ’s @entity0 said the country ’s top mandarin had been ‘ wrong in law ’ during a row over two of @entity8 ’s special advisers			1
it is another blow to the reputation of the cabinet secretary – who is known as sir @entity24 for trying to block the publication of letters related to the @entity27			0
@entity28 and @entity29 , two of the home secretary ’s closest aides , refused an order from @entity34 hq to take part in telephone canvassing during last year ’s @entity37 by - election			1
the pair said it was a breach of the special adviser 's code , which says that - as public servants - they should not conduct canvassing in by - election campaigns and are required to resign their posts if they wish to do so			0
@entity48 and @entity49 disagreed – suspending both men from the list of candidates at the forthcoming general election as a punishment			0
to justify the decision , @entity55 relied upon advice from sir @entity4 , who wields enormous power inside @entity60			1
he controversially ruled it was acceptable for special advisers to take part in ‘ backroom support ’ activities in their private time and telephone canvassing fell into this category			1
but that interpretation has now been flatly rejected by the public administration committee			0
the committee said : ‘ any direction to a @entity72 to conduct telephone canvassing was misguided , and that advice that such a direction or such canvassing was permitted under their @entity77 and contract of employment was wrong in law			1
‘ we recommend that special advisers should never again be confronted with directions or informal pressure that puts them in breach of the @entity77 and of their contracts of employment			2
’ the speaker ’s counsel , @entity90 , told mps he had been ‘ unpersuaded ’ by sir @entity4 ’s arguments			1
mr @entity90 said that , far from being a backroom activity , telephone canvassing involved taking part in a political debate with members of the public			1
mr @entity28 and mr @entity29 are now expected to apply to be re-instated to the candidates list after the election			2
sources said they appeared to have a ‘ slam dunk case ’ to get their suspension lifted			2
labour deputy chairman @entity105 said : ‘ the @entity106 have delivered a damning assessment of the @entity109 operation , and we now need to know which ministers were complicit in issuing this ‘ misguided ’ advice			2
sir @entity4 controversially ruled it was acceptable for special advisers to take part in ‘ backroom support ’ activities in their private time and telephone canvassing fell into this category			1
pictured : @entity8 ‘ given the proximity of the election campaign , we need a formal government response today which outlines how @entity109 will ensure no rules will be broken over the role played by @entity72			0
’ at the time , the decision to remove the advisers from the candidates list was widely seen as the latest episode in a long - running feud between @entity130 and the @entity131			2
tensions have repeatedly flared amid fevered speculation over mrs may ’s own leadership ambitions			0
polls have shown she is the activists ’ favourite to succeed the prime minister			0
another of the home secretary ’s advisers , @entity143 , was forced to quit last summer after clashing with @entity144 over extremism in schools			0
last week , sir @entity4 came under fire over new rules which ban the country ’s 430,000 civil servants from talking to journalists without ministerial approval			1
he approved the order at the request of cabinet office minister @entity155			0
yesterday , the @entity156 told how the move was opposed by @entity159 mayor @entity158 , who said : ‘ @entity160 is the best disinfectant			0
