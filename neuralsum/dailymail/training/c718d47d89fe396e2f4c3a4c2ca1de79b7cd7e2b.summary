volunteer fire departments all across the @entity1 could find themselves out of money and unable to operate unless @entity3 or the @entity4 exempts them from the @entity6			1
' i thought the kinks were worked out of @entity6 at the first of the month , ' @entity8 volunteer firefighter @entity7 told @entity12			2
' man , oh , man , this could potentially destroy some real good companies in @entity8			0
' the @entity1 @entity17 takes the term ' volunteer ' literally , but the @entity20 says volunteer firefighters are technically employees if they 're on the job more than 30 hours per week , making them subject to @entity6 's employee - mandate rules			1
the vast majority of @entity1 firefighters are community volunteers wildfires like this august 2013 disaster near @entity37 , @entity38 bring volunteer firefighters out of the woodwork to risk their lives since the @entity6 law does n't specifically carve out an exemption for them , fire departments where 50 or more people work – either as volunteers or officially as employees – are expected to provide health insurance for every one of them			1
in towns with more than one volunteer fire department , all the staffers will likely be lumped together for tax purposes , pushing many municipalities above the 50 - worker threshold			2
that could cost departments of life - savers hundreds of thousands of dollars each year			1
those that dump their volunteers into the federal insurance exchanges would still have to pay an annual $ 2,000 fine for each ' employee ' after the first 30			2
' i can tell you right now we ca n’t afford it , ' @entity66 , @entity68 fire company chief @entity67 told the @entity73			0
' while a volunteer fire department may not have a payroll , the rest of it is n’t free			0
the only part that is free is the labor			0
' @entity67 's concerns are likely to get at least some attention in @entity30 : he 's also the state fire commissioner in @entity68 , where 97 per cent of fire departments are fully or mostly staffed by volunteers			1
that 's the highest percentage in the @entity1 employees ? volunteer firefighters count toward an employer 's worker totals under the @entity6 , since the law does n't carve out a exception for them ' a public safety disaster ' : volunteer fire departments could close down unless the government exempts them from @entity6 nationally , the @entity94 reports that volunteer fire departments make up 71 per cent of @entity1 's 1 million firehouses			1
another 16 per cent are ' mostly volunteer			0
' it 's unclear how many of those departments involve at least 50 people , making the potential impact of the @entity6 's latest unintended consequence difficult to calculate			2
but the @entity102 has asked the @entity20 to let all volunteer departments off the hook			2
the federal government has taken no action so far			0
firefighters in @entity108 , @entity109 are mostly volunteers			0
they fought this house fire and put it out without a single injury ' if the @entity20 classifies volunteer firefighters and emergency medical personnel as employees in their final rule , fire departments may be unintentionally forced to comply with requirements that could force them to curtail their emergency response activities or close entirely , ' the organization said in a statement			1
a @entity1 @entity122 spokesperson said in a statement that the agency has ' received a number of comments concerning volunteer firefighters and other volunteers in response to proposed regulations issued last december			1
' ' we are taking those comments into account as we work toward issuing final regulations on the employer - responsibility provision ' of the @entity6 , the spokesperson said			0
but @entity136 , a volunteer firefighter for 50 years and leader of the @entity138 in @entity139 , @entity68 , said an @entity20 rule that officially makes volunteers subject to @entity6 employer mandates would be a disaster			1
' we 're barely paying the bills that we have now , ' he told the @entity145 @entity68 @entity146 rep. @entity146 fired off a letter to the @entity20 last week			0
' @entity6 has raised more questions than it has answered , ' @entity146 said in a statement			0
' first , are volunteer firefighters considered employees and therefore subject to the employer mandate under @entity6 ? and second , how should volunteer time be counted to see if they ’re working 30 hours ? ' aftermath : on dec. 4 a home in @entity157 , @entity155 was reduced to cinders -- and volunteers kept the blaze from spreading to forests or other houses even big municipalities like @entity164 , @entity165 need volunteer firefighters			1
this november 27 fire destroyed a downtown store and damaged three others ' does it mean when a volunteer is wearing a beeper or carrying a fire department cell phone ? does it include downtime at the station house ? listening to a scanner ? ' ' if @entity6 is the law of the land , then so is the law of unintended consequences , ' he said , ' and there seems to be a lot of that going around these days			2
' @entity188 @entity187 rep. @entity187 had his own evaluation of the rule for the @entity20 , writing in a letter to acting commissioner @entity192 that it will produce ' a public safety disaster			0

the @entity6 forces companies with more than 50 workers to *buy* them all health insurance or pay hefty fines
the @entity20 says volunteer firefighters are ' employees , ' even though the @entity17 says they 're ' volunteers '
out of more than 1 million fire departments in the @entity1 , 87 per cent are staffed entirely or mostly by life - saving volunteers
*members* of @entity3 are weighing in , but the @entity209 administration has n't taken any action yet to carve out a fire - fighting exception
