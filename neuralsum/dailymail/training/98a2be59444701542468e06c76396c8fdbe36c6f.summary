by @entity0 published : 05:30 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 06:23 est , 11 april 2013 a baby who developed a rare condition called a hair tourniquet - where a strand of hair wrapped around her toe and cut off the blood supply - was given a morphine overdose upon arriving at hospital			1
@entity10 was rushed to @entity11 after her toe became infected			1
although rare , hair tourniquets are most common in babies because their mothers suffer from post-pregnancy hair loss			1
a stray hair that ends up on clothes can then wrap itself around a child 's toe like cheese wire , cutting off the circulation			1
@entity10 ( with father @entity22 ) developed a rare condition called a hair tourniquet - where a strand of hair wrapped around her toe and cut off the blood supply tourniquets occur when a stray hair ends up on babies mittens and clothes			1
this can then wrap itself around a child 's toe like cheese wire , cutting off the circulation infections can develop as the hair cuts into the flesh as it tightens , potentially leading to amputation			1
although most commonly seen as a ' toe touniquet ' , other appendages such as fingers , ear lobes and male genitalia can also be affected			0
@entity10 's parents @entity22 and @entity47 noticed her red , swollen foot when they undressed her for bed one night			1
surgeons said they had never experienced such a severe and sore case and had to cut through the skin to break the knot			0
as they operated , nurses gave @entity10 morphine , to relieve the pain			1
hair tourniquet syndrome is a rare condition that , in half of cases , affects children 's toes			2
the hair is wrapped around the digit by a repetitive movement of the body part in a confined area , such as hands in mittens or feet and legs in pyjamas or socks			2
babies are particularly at risk due to the post-pregnancy hair loss their mothers experience			1
because human hair is so thin and , in the instance of colours like blonde almost invisible to the naked eye , tourniquets can be misdiagnosed as a foreign body reaction or infection			2
infections can develop as the hair cuts into the flesh as it tightens , potentially leading to amputation			0
tourniquets are usually identified with a magnifiying glass and then cut away with small scissors			2
but her parents were horrified to discover that staff had given the 11 - month - old double the recommended dose of morphine			1
it took staff 45 minutes before they realised @entity10 had received 4mg of the powerful painkiller , instead of 2mg			2
her father @entity22 said : ' i found out they had given her the dose recommended for a 12 - year - old , not a baby			2
' a doctor told us we had been lucky not to lose her			0
' staff then had to perform a lifesaving reversal procedure by injecting drugs directly into a blood vessel			0
mr @entity114 , 27 , said : ' @entity10 ’s breathing started slowing down where her lungs were too relaxed			0
' it was terrifying seeing her out - for - the - count and her all wired up			0
the worst thing was the lack of information with no - one telling us what was happening to her			0
' @entity10 , who has scabs and scarring to her foot , made a full recovery after spending a day on children ’s ward			0
surgeons had to cut through the skin to break the knot of hair , but accidentally gave @entity10 double recommended dose of morphine , which could have killed her @entity10 , who has scabs and scarring to her foot , has now made a full recovery her parents , who also claim she caught gastroenteritis while at the hospital , have lodged an official complaint			1
mr @entity114 said : ' we are absolutely furious			0
' @entity142 , deputy chief executive at @entity11 , said : ' we sincerely apologise for this incident and we are formally investigating what went wrong			0
' we will be contacting @entity114 and mrs @entity10 by the end of next week , asking them to take part in that investigation so that we fully understand the issues involved			0
