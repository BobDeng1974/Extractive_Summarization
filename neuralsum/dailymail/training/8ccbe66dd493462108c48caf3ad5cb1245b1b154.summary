senior crown prosecutor @entity177 said after the case : ' what @entity3 did goes against the heart of the criminal justice system			2
dissatisfied with the outcome of a @entity41 trial involving her boyfriend @entity17 , she tried to change it in a calculating and devious manner			0
' she sought to undermine the stories of two of her partner 's victims , firstly by creating fictitious @entity2 accounts in their names and then recording false conversations on those accounts which implied the women had lied at the trial of @entity17			1
this information was then passed to the police			0
' initially the accounts were so believable that the police had to instigate a criminal investigation against the two victims , which involved their arrest and questioning at a police station			0
it soon became apparent however that ms @entity3 was involved and an early analysis of her computer revealed criminal behaviour			0
' obtaining the evidence to prove exactly what ms @entity3 had done still proved to be complex and took time as we worked closely with @entity212 as well as @entity2 and @entity213 in the @entity214			2
' when the evidence was put to ms @entity3 she denied any wrongdoing but eventually had to accept that the case against her was so overwhelming that she was left with no alternative but to plead guilty , and she has now been sentenced by the @entity41 to two and a half years imprisonment			1
' it 's disturbing to think that anyone could put victims of violent and sexual abuse through further torment but @entity3 decided to take on the criminal justice system			2
