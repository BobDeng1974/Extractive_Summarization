a massive surge in immigration is driving the need for at least 42,000 new homes a year to be built in @entity5 , a report warned yesterday			1
a damning dossier accused @entity5 mayor @entity7 of ‘ entirely misrepresenting ’ the reason for the capital ’s relentlessly rising population – a trend which will lead to unprecedented housing development			1
but a predicted increase of a million foreigners over the next 15 years must be matched by the same number of @entity17 being ‘ driven ’ out of the metropolis , or the ambitious target will be doomed to failure because there will still be too few homes , it warned			1
@entity23 , the immigration think - tank which published the report , said it was ‘ sheer nonsense ’ for the @entity32 ’s to claim that the predicted population boom would be caused by natural growth from the city ’s ‘ youthful population ’			1
the coastal town is a hub for many trying to make their way into @entity41 between 1991 and 2011 , the @entity41 - born population of @entity5 was static at 5.2million while foreign - born residents doubled to 3million – a total population of around 8.2million			1
it is projected to increase to 10million by 2029 , overwhelmingly driven by the arrival of 1.1million immigrants and births to existing and future foreign families , says the report			1
in 2012 , only one - third of births were to parents who were both @entity41 - born , it said			0
@entity23 said this would place further huge demand on the city ’s housing stock , which is already struggling to cope with its rapidly swelling population			2
housing supply has not kept pace with the number of residents living in @entity5 meaning waiting lists for social housing have doubled since 2000 , private rents soared to more than £ 1,400 a month and property prices soared to an average price of £ 514,000 – around nine - times median earnings			0
critics have recently said the cost of buying or renting a property in the capital is being pushed ‘ beyond the boundary ’ of what is affordable			2
to tackle the problem , mr @entity7 has pledged to double the number of homes being built to 42,000 , by freeing up brownfield sites , converting existing properties into flats or building on the green belt			1
but in its 20 - page report , ‘ @entity86 ’ , @entity23 said the target was ‘ optimistic ’			2
a new report has accused @entity5 mayor @entity7 ( pictured ) of misrepresenting the reason for the capital 's rising population achieving this number was dependent on around 1million @entity17 leaving the capital for other parts of the country			1
many are middle - class families who are pushed out because they can not afford a house in @entity5 and can find cheaper homes in other places with better schools , hospitals and transport , and less crime			0
sir @entity103 , chairman of @entity23 , said : ‘ @entity5 ’s huge population increase in the last two decades has been driven solely by immigration and the same will apply over the next 15 years			1
‘ @entity107 has been less than frank about what is going on			0
the general public have no idea of the extent to which immigration is driving the city ’s housing crisis and causing @entity17 to leave			0
sir @entity103 ( pictured ) , chairman of @entity23 , said @entity5 's huge population increases have been driven solely by immigration ‘ the business lobby seem to have a lofty disregard for the lives of ordinary @entity17			1
it is ludicrous for them to suggest that @entity5 needs immigrants on anything like the present scale			0
‘ the inevitable effect is massive pressure on schools and hospitals and , especially , on housing			0
@entity5 needs skilled migration , not mass migration			0
’ he added : ‘ those who promote the idea of an international city effectively free of constraints on immigration seem to be blind to the implications for the existing population of @entity5			2
‘ they should be clear that the result will be more @entity17 forced to leave the city and find somewhere else to live			0
are they content with that outcome ? ’ concerns about the impact of migration have increased since @entity143 introduced an effectively open - door immigration policy after the 1997 election , affecting the social make - up of cities , unemployment and pressure on housing and services			0
net migration remains stubbornly high at more than 200,000 a year , mainly due to @entity154 immigration			0
critics have warned it means @entity159 's promise to reduce net migration to tens of thousands , the levels of the 1990s , will be virtually impossible to achieve			2
in a joint statement , @entity165 mp @entity164 and @entity167 grandee sir @entity166 mp , who co-chair the cross-party group @entity168 , said : ‘ just as the @entity170 referendum has blown open the @entity41 constitution , so has this latest report on housing needs blown open the debate on immigration			1
the report shows @entity5 ’s housing stock is creaking			0

a predicted increase of a million foreigners must be matched by new builds
report accuses @entity7 of misrepresenting reason for capital 's boom
group says *attributing* population boom to natural growth was ' nonsense '
