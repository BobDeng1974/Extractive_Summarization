by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:18 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 06:28 est , 3 january 2014 a secret plan was hatched by the @entity5 government to stop union leaders smuggling suitcases of @entity9 cash in @entity10			1
ministers believed hundreds of thousands of pounds were being channelled to the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) from @entity13 in 1984			1
newly - released documents from the @entity15 reveal @entity5 was told by her closest aides how customs officials should be put on alert for large sums of money being brought into the @entity10			1
funds : the @entity5 government was convinced that suitcases of money brought into @entity10 by mining union leaders came from the @entity9 regime ( file picture ) the desperate plan to stem the flow of money to the unions came at a time when mrs @entity5 considered mobilising hundreds of troops and declaring a state of emergency at the height of the 1984 miners ’ strike			1
another option was to switch to a three - day working week after ministers warned her that the lights could go out in @entity10			1
the @entity12 ’s assets had been sequestered by the courts after its president , @entity43 , refused to allow it to pay a £ 200,000 fine for contempt			2
but officials told @entity5 there was little they could do to stop the flow of roubles to support the union ’s battle with the government			1
the @entity55 prime minister was told the best they could hope for was that a @entity12 courier might be picked up by @entity58 trying to enter the country with ‘ a suitcase full of bank notes ’			1
minsters were alerted by @entity63 to the @entity9 financial lifeline for the miners in early november 1984			2
a few days later the @entity9 news agency @entity66 reported publicly that £ 500,000 had been raised to support the strike			2
support : the money was used to bankroll the miners ' strike after the @entity12 of @entity73 ' assets were frozen by the courts although the money was supposed to have been donated by @entity78 miners , the government had little doubt that the funds could only have been transferred abroad with the approval of the @entity9 authorities			2
cabinet secretary sir @entity83 was forced to admit to @entity5 that there was little the authorities in the @entity10 could do , but despite the sequestration order			1
in a memo written on 5 november 1982 , sir @entity83 said : ‘ there are no powers which could be used to prevent the transfer of funds from abroad to the @entity93 ( @entity12 ) or to somebody nominated to receive them on behalf of the @entity12 in this country , ’ he wrote in a memorandum dated november 5			0
‘ if a representative of the @entity12 could be detected entering this country with a suitcase full of bank notes , it might be possible to arrange for him to be stopped and searched by @entity58			0
‘ they would have no power to impound the notes , but they would inform the @entity106 and the police of any suspiciously large volume of banknotes which they detected			0
’ talks : mrs @entity5 raised the issue of the money with @entity78 @entity114 in december 1984 , but it was dismissed as a purely @entity10 problem he added : ‘ i am afraid this is not certain to yield results , but i am satisfied that it is the best we can do			1
i have made arrangements to give very quick consideration of possible courses of action , if those who are exercising vigilance get a break we can exploit			0
’ ministers , however , did not want to give up			2
@entity128 in the attorney general 's office wrote to the @entity130 stating that the government ‘ now have an interest , going beyond their ordinary political interest , in the sequestrators laying their hands on @entity12 funds ’			0
he went on : ‘ if the @entity130 now have or acquire in the future any concrete information about the way in which the money in question is being transferred , it would therefore be very desirable that that information - not necessarily , of course , in its ' raw ' form - should be passed onto the sequestrators			0
’ meanwhile , industry minister @entity147 was instructed to raise the issue at a private lunch with the @entity9 ambassador in @entity151 , but he got nowhere			0
finally , it fell to @entity5 herself to tackle @entity114 - the rising star of the @entity154 - when he made his historic first visit to @entity10 in december 1984			1
although after their meeting at @entity158 , she famously declared that he was a man she could ‘ do business with ’ , on this issue at least she made little headway			0
‘ mr @entity114 asked whether the prime minister really believed that @entity9 communists were so strong as to be to keep the @entity10 miners out on strike for over 10 months , ’ the official minute noted			0
‘ the problem was purely a @entity10 one			0

ministers wanted to stem flow of roubles to unions from @entity13
officials told @entity5 that little could be done to stop it
but *suggested* a *nationwide* alert for customs officers to intercept cash
@entity15 also reveal mrs @entity5 considered calling in troops
