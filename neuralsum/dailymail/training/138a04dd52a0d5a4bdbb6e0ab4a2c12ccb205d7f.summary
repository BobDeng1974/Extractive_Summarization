by @entity0 published : 11:26 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 11:35 est , 26 august 2013 the flight of the bumblebee might seem effortless to humans , but to stay airborne and give the impression of gliding along , the insects beat their tiny wings two hundred times a second			0
scientists have long pondered just how the bees have the energy to achieve such a feat but now two biophysicists have studied the mechanics behind the insect 's flight by capturing the action in molecular detail			1
the researchers filmed live bumblebees at 5,000 frames per second to conclude the insects ' muscles might work by using ' stretch activation ' - the same mechanism that makes vertebrate 's muscles move			1

' once the insect flight muscles are activated by nerves , they oscillate simultaneously ' @entity43 , a muscle physiologist at the @entity45 , told nature			0
he said the oscillations are triggered by ' stretch activation , ' which means the force generated by the antagonistic flight muscles increases in strength when they are extended , to pull the wing back			2
the same technique is used in the human heart and other muscles that beat rhythmically , according to @entity58 , a molecular biologist at @entity59			0
but because of difference in how the technique works in insects , there is ' no upper limit to the wing - beat frequency , ' he said			0
to investigate what triggers stretch activation , dr @entity32 and dr @entity33 measured changes in the insects ' muscles while they were trying to fly , at molecular level			2
to do this , they glued live bees onto the end of a thin metal tube and then put the insects in the path of an x-ray beam			0
they then studied the pattern of bright spots formed when the x-rays were scattered by the muscles , which they recorded at 5,000 frames per second			1
they concluded stretch activation is caused by the interaction of actin and myosin in the muscle - which is the same trigger as in vertebrates , suggesting that insects do not have a special technique to keep them airborne .			2
