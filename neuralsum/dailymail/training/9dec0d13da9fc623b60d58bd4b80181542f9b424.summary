by @entity0 published : 11:40 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 11:50 est , 12 december 2012 the female @entity2 agent credited with tracking down @entity3 was passed over for promotion amid widespread jealousy among her colleagues over her part in finding the terror mastermind			1
the agent also came under investigation for meeting with the makers of the @entity14 film ' @entity12 ' which chronicles the hunt for the @entity17 leader			1
according to the @entity18 , she has been at the center of controversy during the promotion of the film , and one of the clearest examples came after an email was sent announcing that she won an award and dozens of her colleagues were given less prestigious recognition			1
that was too much for her to bare			0
she reportedly sent an email essentially saying : ' you guys tried to obstruct me			1
only i deserve the award , ' and sent it to the entire agency			0
a @entity48 navy seal team shot dead @entity3 in may 2011 after a stealth raid on his compound in @entity44			2
in the aftermath of the successful raid a female agent was given much of the credit for refusing to give up in the 10 year manhunt			2
it was her persistence that led to @entity3 finally being tracked down by agents by following one of his trusted couriers			1
the female agent , who is in her 30s , has never been named and still works for the spy agency in a counter terrorism unit			2
women of the film : @entity65 plays the lead character ( left ) and said that she knew the film would be politically controversial , while director @entity67 ( right ) said that the torture scenes were the hardest to film but following the death of @entity3 , the @entity18 reports that she was widely expected to get promotion - only to be passed over			1
the agent is said to have angered many of her colleagues by sending out an email saying they did not deserve the same accolades as her for finding @entity3			1
although she was given a cash award for her work on finding @entity3 missing out on promotion is said to have cost her a rise of $ 16,000 a year			1
@entity80 : the real - life agent who spearheaded the raid is reportedly furious that other agents - who she feels slowed down the progress of the search - were given awards for their work propaganda : @entity3 -- watching @entity89 on television in @entity44 before he died a profile of the agent in the @entity18 said many of her colleagues were envious of the attention she received from @entity14			1
star : many in the @entity2 are reportedly envious of how the female agent is getting so much credit for the assassination of @entity3 ' she ’s not @entity101 , but that ’s not going to find @entity3 , ' said a former @entity2 associate			1
other colleagues said she had been treated harshly and had come under suspicion of cooperating too closely with the makers of @entity12 , which opens in the @entity48 on december 19th			2
the film has been tipped for @entity108 success and has already won a host of critics awards			2
it is also mired in controversy with the opening scenes showing terror suspects being waterboarded and @entity48 politicians complaining that director @entity67 was given too much access			0
the role of the female @entity2 agent is played by @entity40 and has the fictional name of ' @entity38 '			1
the film shows her dogged pursuit of @entity3 and challenging superiors who doubted he would ever be found			1
a spokesman for the @entity2 refused to talk about the agent but said many people were involved in the hunt for @entity3			1
spokeswoman @entity128 said : ' over the course of a decade , hundreds of analysts , operators and many others played key roles in the hunt			0
' the film 's director @entity67 has been quick to dole out praise to the unidentified agent , however			2
' with her tenacity , her courage and her dedication , really drove that lead forward and gave it a lot of traction and the interesting thing about the movie is it puts you in her shoes , ' @entity67 said during an appearance on @entity150 ' this morning			0
the @entity152 seal who wrote the controversial book detailing the assassination of @entity3 credits a ' feisty ' female @entity2 analyst for leading them to their target , after spending five years hunting him			1
author @entity159 – whose identity was revealed even though he wrote the tell - all book under the pen name of @entity164 – only refers to the woman using the pseudonym ‘ @entity167 ’ in his book			0
same inspiration ? @entity171 ' character @entity170 is thought to be based on the female agent who lead the search for @entity3 , and she is also at the center of the upcoming film @entity12 the similarities between her backstory and that of the lead character in the hit television series @entity182 are obvious			1
' i ca n't give her enough credit , ' he said during the interview			0
' i mean , she , in my opinion , she kind of teed up this whole thing			0
' in his book , @entity191 writes that he sat next to the woman during one of the long - haul flights as they headed to @entity44 for the mission , and his brief description paints a picture of a young and extremely dedicated analyst			0
' recruited by the agency out of college , she 'd been working on the @entity3 task force for the last five years			2
analysts rotated in and out of the task force , but she stayed and kept after it			0
' after the @entity208 phone call , she 'd worked to put all the pieces together ... she had been our go - to analyst on all intelligence questions regarding the target , ' he writes			0
even though the fact that the @entity2 is dominated by men is well - documented , it may be too quick to assume that the same ‘ wicked smart , kind of feisty ’ agent that @entity191 wrote about was the basis for the lead character in the @entity220 - winning series @entity182			1
however , actress @entity171 hinted at a connection during an interview about the research she did to prepare for her role as @entity170			0
' there ’s a woman @entity226 is loosely modeled on and she ’s a @entity2 officer and so i met with her and she took me to @entity2 and introduced me to some of her colleagues , ' @entity171 told @entity230			2
the @entity182 protagonist is described as being stubborn , headstrong , and outspoken			0
the same appears true for the female agent			2
' @entity167 was n't afraid to share her opinion with even the highest officers , ' @entity191 wrote in the book			0
' this was her baby			0
@entity167 and her team spent five years tracking him to get us where we were now			0
' --- @entity240 watch the trailer here			0
