' i could n't feel or move my legs at first and just thought i would n't be able to walk again			0
' it sounds stupid to say but we were lucky we hit the mountain			0
' if we had veered the other way we 'd have fallen down a steep precipice and we 'd have had no chance			0
' @entity9 and @entity8 had saved up for three years to pay for the three - month - long £ 4,000 holiday as she had not returned home to @entity12 since arriving in the @entity67 12 years ago			1

on september 27 , they made the trip to @entity19 through the @entity79 hotel , where they were staying , and were making their descent when tragedy struck			2
after being pinned between the bus and the ground , @entity9 had to wait until all the other passengers had got off before using his good arm to dig himself out			2
their tour guide was unable to call emergency services as his phone was out of charge so someone was sent on foot to the nearest town for help , but it was miles away			0
a tourist who had heard the accident reported on the radio drove to the scene in a pick - up truck and took the injured to the island 's clinic where @entity9 's arms was put in a makeshift splint			2
the @entity19 volcan , but on the journey to the spectacular site a bus crash left @entity8 and @entity9 with injuries and subsequently huge medical bills after 24 hours the group was flown to the only hospital on the islands			1

a trip to the @entity19 volcano on @entity20 in the @entity21 turned sour for the couple @entity8 , @entity9 and his family say they gave the hospital everything they could , but it took five weeks to raise the total and they say they were effectively imprisoned			1
@entity9 's dad transferred the remaining money over to @entity8 's aunt , @entity158			1
the couple finally returned to the @entity67 on october 26 , but have been told they will have to return to the @entity21 to try and recover their medical costs through their legal system			0

' but we have n't had any reply since we got back to this country - we 're stuck			0
' a statement from the @entity175 in @entity12 said : ' on september 26 the unfortunate accident happened where the coach suffered a mechanical failure causing it to overturn , meaning the tourists travelling were injured			1
' they were immediately rescued and taken to a local hospital			0
' however , the severity of @entity9 and @entity8 's injuries meant they were sent immediately by helicopter to the @entity187 in @entity188 on the mainland			1
' the next day , they were transferred to @entity191			0
