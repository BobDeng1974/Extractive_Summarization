this micro pig must be barking mad			1
@entity1 was bought as a tiny companion to a pair of @entity4 has grown up thinking he 's a dog - and now begs for biscuits and rolls over			1
the two - year - old was raised with the dogs after his owners snapped him up during the craze to have the miniature animals as family pets			1
but it is thought the yorkie 's behaviour rubbed off on confused @entity1 and now the pig will come when he 's called , roll over on command and even beg for a biscuit			1
the confused porker 's favourite snacks are dog biscuits and bananas @entity28 ! @entity1 pokes his head through the cat flap , and loves to beg and roll over he also bangs on the door with his snout to be let into the house , gives kisses to his masters and mistresses and tries to help bring in the post too			1
but despite his canine - like talents , @entity1 who started life no bigger than the size of teacup has had to be given a new home after he grew so big his owners were unable to cope with him			1
he is now starting a new life at @entity46 , in @entity47 , @entity48 - with his old owners making regular visits and making donations towards his upkeep			1
trustee and fundraising coordinator , @entity54 , said : ' @entity1 is just like a dog , it 's so funny he honestly believes he is one			1
' he 's big like a dog in size and when you call his name he comes running			2
' he sits very well and he will roll over when you ask him to			0
@entity1 was n't abandoned but his family decided they could no longer look after him and asked the sanctuary to take him ' he just loves playing and he can beg for biscuits like a dog too			1
he loves to run around and be silly and he has his mad half hours just like dogs			2
' if he wants to come inside he bangs on the door with his snout or sticks his head through the cat flap			0
' he goes and gets the post but instead of bringing it to us he runs off with it and wo n't give us it back			0
' i think a lot of his " doggy " behaviour has to do with the fact that with his original owners he was brought up with two @entity4 terrier 's			0
' i think a lot of how they were must have rubbed off on him			0
' he 's a real character and he just loves interacting with people			0
' the other day he went in my handbag and ran off with my banana , just like a puppy			0
i had to chase him for it and when i took it from him he just looked at me and gave this loud grunt			0
' micro pigs are a miniature breed , which start out no bigger than a teacup , before growing to a slightly smaller size than a normal pig , around human knee height			2
celebrities such as @entity102 bought the tiny piglets and were shocked when the ballooned in size			0
how much is that piggy in the window ? the little porker became confused after living with two @entity4 however , although @entity1 's previous owners knew he would grow , they could no longer look after him			1
@entity54 continued : ' @entity1 's original owners knew what they were getting when they got @entity1 , it was n't a surprise when he got so big			1
' but they were moving house and where they were moving to did n't have a garden , so they could n't take @entity1 with them			2
' they visit him all the time and they make donations to the sanctuary for looking after him			2
' the good thing is that now he 's living the most wonderful life , he talks to the chickens , he 's got the ponies as friends and he 's got another potbellied pig too			0
' @entity1 will stay with us now as part of the sanctuary			1
his owners know where he is and can come and visit and he 's having a fabulous time too			0
' he 's happy here and we 're happy to have to him			0
' we 've got a real assortment of animals here , we 've got 12 ponies , a donkey , two pigs , a lot of chickens , five ferrets , three rabbits and 25 cats , who live here as they can not be rehomed			0
' it costs about Â£ 200,000 to keep them all and we do n't get support from anywhere except public donations			2
' it can be a real struggle but we need to keep going for the sake of animals like @entity1			2
