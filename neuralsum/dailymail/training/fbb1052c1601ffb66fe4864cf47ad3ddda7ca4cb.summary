by @entity0 published : 12:01 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 20:19 est , 12 december 2012 education secretary @entity1 wrote to headteachers , advising a ' robust response ' to striking staff , including cutting pay headmasters were yesterday told to slash the pay of teachers taking industrial action after thousands joined a campaign of disruption			1
members of the @entity14 and rival @entity15 have been working to rule complaining about pay , pensions and working conditions			1
but ministers have received legal advice that teachers are ‘ highly likely ’ to be breaking their contracts if they refuse to carry out 25 classroom tasks			0
the industrial action includes refusing to cover for other staff , hand in lesson plans or complete more than one pupil report per year			1
education secretary @entity1 wrote to headmasters saying they can dock the pay of those taking industrial action			1
he accused the staff of being ‘ highly irresponsible ’ and demanded ‘ robust action ’			1
mr @entity1 warned the work - to - rule scheme , launched in october , is creating ‘ major problems ’ in schools where militant teachers hold sway , threatening the quality of pupils ’ education and placing additional burdens on other teachers			1
legal advice says that teachers who are following the industrial action ‘ are very likely to be in breach of their contracts ’ and that ‘ pay deductions represent a lawful response ’			1
mr @entity1 pointed out only a ‘ tiny proportion ’ of teachers voted for industrial action , with just a 27 per cent turnout in the case of the @entity14			1
but while the ‘ vast majority of schools are currently unaffected ’ , mr @entity1 said : ‘ a small number , however , are starting to see a severe impact and where this is the case , i believe a robust response is needed			1
‘ this action sets out only to cause unnecessary disruption in schools , while at the same time threatening to damage children ’s education			1
‘ i am also concerned about the increased burden on the many hard - working teachers across the country			2
mr @entity1 claims industrial action taken by the @entity14 and @entity15 teaching unions of ' severe impact ' on schools ( file picture ) @entity77 education secretary @entity76 condemned the union action but accused mr @entity1 of ' playing politics ' ‘ industrial action of this kind is associated with significant damage to pupil outcomes			1
i believe we should tackle this action swiftly and firmly before it causes any more damage in schools			0
’ the @entity1 has already clashed with the unions over government plans – recommended by the teaching pay review body – to scrap national pay bargaining and introduce performance - related pay			2
that will allow heads to reward talented teachers rather than waste money on pay rises for those who have simply served the longest			2
@entity15 ’s @entity99 said : ‘ any school which acts on his advice leaves itself vulnerable to extensive and expensive litigation and escalation of industrial action			1
’ she claimed ‘ not one single day of education has been disrupted as a result ’ of the industrial action			2
shadow education secretary @entity76 said : ‘ we oppose this industrial action being taken by the @entity14 and @entity15			1
‘ it is not right that schools and pupils should be affected in this way			0
‘ but @entity1 is playing politics			2
this is not the way to attract new recruits to the profession			0
’ a @entity121 spokesman said : ‘ @entity15 and @entity14 are trying to intimidate school leaders through threats of strike action and legal action			1
‘ we will support any school that takes appropriate sanctions against this irresponsible industrial action			0
’ @entity129 , i am writing to you to seek your support in tackling a threat to the quality of pupils ’ education which has emerged recently			0
i am referring to the highly irresponsible industrial action started by the @entity14 and @entity15 on 3 october			1
the @entity14 and @entity15 have issued a series of 25 instructions setting out activities which their members should refuse to undertake			1
only a tiny proportion of the profession voted in favour of this industrial action – with a turnout of only 27 % in the case of the nut			0
an even smaller proportion of teachers are choosing to follow these instructions			0
the vast majority of schools are currently unaffected			0
a small number , however , are starting to see a severe impact and where this is the case , i believe a robust response is needed			1
i respect the right of teachers to take industrial action , but this action short of a strike lacks a clear purpose or even a set of coherent aims			2
it sets out only to cause unnecessary disruption in schools , while at the same time threatening to damage children ’s education			2
the @entity14 and @entity15 have instructed their members to refuse to undertake cover for other teachers , creating additional work for their colleagues			1
the unions want their members to refuse to hand in lesson plans to senior management , making it more difficult for them to manage their schools			1
perhaps most unreasonably , the instructions go as far as refusing to provide more than one written report each year to parents			0
those are only three of twenty five instructions , which would place unnecessary pressure on headteachers , governing bodies and @entity187			0
i am also concerned about the increased burden on the many hard - working teachers across the country who are focusing entirely on providing the best education possible for all of their pupils			2
i am sure that you will agree that this is not a constructive or effective way for organisations representing professionals to work			0
i believe it is damaging the reputation of the profession with the public , at a time when we have the best ever cohort who are working harder than ever			0
feedback from parents suggests they find it difficult to understand why the education of their children needs to suffer			2
feedback from teachers suggests they find it frustrating that they need to pick up the work that other teachers should be doing			0
furthermore , international evidence shows that industrial action of this kind is associated with significant damage to pupil outcomes , particularly in the long term			0
the threat to pupil outcomes in affected schools is therefore a real one			0
i believe we should tackle this action swiftly and firmly before it causes any more damage in schools			0
in response to requests from headteachers , i have published advice for schools on the @entity121 website about appropriate sanctions , which i have also attached to this letter			0
the legal position is clear : teachers who are following this industrial action are very likely to be in breach of their contracts			0
pay deductions represent a lawful response , and the advice sets out how deductions can be made in a proportionate and reasonable way			0
i would be very grateful if you could support your school ( s ) in taking a robust response , including through pay deductions where appropriate			1
i am convinced that by working together in a coordinated way we can protect the pupils , parents , teachers and headteachers who would otherwise suffer because of this irresponsible industrial action			2
