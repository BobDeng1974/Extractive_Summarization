while there are plenty other attractions - from over 6,000 live animals to a slew of free concerts - the @entity0 has become notorious for its food			1
or , perhaps more accurately , for what new delicious thing can be deep fried or wrapped in bacon			2
and 2015 will be no different			0
opening thursday , the menu for this year 's fair is headlined by a @entity13 - a beef patty with bacon , cheese , lettuce , tomato and pickle served between two crunchy glazed funnel cakes , according to the @entity21			1
its a fitting new item from the fair , which first became famous for its @entity44 donut burger			1
according to @entity47 , one serving of funnel cakes serves up 44 grams of fat and 88 grams of carbohydrates , giving a total 760 calories			2
add to that the contents of the burger - such as the one served up by @entity53 - and the funnel cake burger gives you an estimated total of 97 grams of fat and a whopping 1420 calories			2
but the greasiness does n't stop there			0
