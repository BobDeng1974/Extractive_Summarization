this is the brave little girl who is battling through a massive birthmark			1
@entity3 was born with the birthmark which stretches down from her face , down the side of her body			1
strangers have even asked her parents if they have left her too near the radiator and burnt her , when they see her for the first time			1
but brave @entity3 , two , does n't let the regular laser treatments dampen her fighting spirit			1
@entity3 has to undergo laser treatment on a regular basis to help get rid of a birthmark on her face some people have even asked @entity3 's parents if she has been left next to a radiator and burned parents @entity20 and @entity21 said they did not think @entity3 would live for more than a few hours			1
this month they are looking forward to celebrating her third birthday father @entity20 , 45 , who lives in @entity24 , @entity25 , with wife @entity21 , 41 , said : ' @entity3 is absolutely amazing			1
' despite everything she has been through , she is still happy and she has a smile for everyone			0
she 's doing fantastically well			0
' the couple had no idea there was anything wrong with @entity3 before she was born in october 2010 , weighing a healthy @entity33			1
her father described her as a fighter adding that ' she 's our little miracle ' mrs @entity3 's pregnancy had n't been easy as there was too much fluid in her amniotic sac , and the doctors decided to deliver the baby early			1
when she was born she had a dark purple mark down the side of her face , which initially doctors thought was a bruise			2
but then half an hour later , they broke the devastating news to the couple that it was a birthmark			2
two weeks later she was diagnosed with a condition called @entity53 , a rare neurological and skin disorder			1
it causes learning difficulties , paralysis and seizures			0
because she was so ill , @entity3 was rushed from @entity60 to @entity61 in @entity62			1
@entity20 said : ' we could n't travel with her as she was so ill. as we stood watching her being taken away , we did n't know if we were going to see her again			0
' we 'd been so excited at our baby 's arrival , now within a matter of hours we did n't know whether we would even see her alive again			0
' but even from a day old , @entity3 was a force to be reckoned with			1
she had also been born with two holes in her heart , which was even more difficult for her survival			2
she managed to survive her first surgery , and when she was two months old she went to the operating theatre again for surgery to repair the two holes in her heart			2
@entity20 said : ' we were terrified when she was wheeled down for the surgery - even though she was two months old - she still looked so small to be having such major surgery			2
eventually the surgeon came up to see us and told us the surgery had been successful			2
' the doctors have said take @entity3 's birthmark may take 16 years of treatment for it to fade			1
she has recently started laser treatment to stop it carrying on growing as she gets older			2
when she was born she had a dark purple mark down the side of her face , which initially doctors thought was a bruise two weeks after being told @entity3 had a birthmark she was diagnosed with a condition called @entity53 @entity20 said : ' she has treatment every couple of months , and the laser does make it look more red and angry , and her face is covered with blobs afterwards , which then gradually fade away again			1
' we do get people staring at @entity3 when she goes out - especially after she 's had the laser treatment - which is hurtful			1
@entity3 pictured in a walking frame which her parents have recently bought ' we have even had people accusing us of leaving her to near the radiator , and causing her face to go red			1
' people think we are the bad parents - that we have somehow caused @entity3 to look like she does			1
' they just see what is in front of them and jump to hurtful conclusions			0
' i wish they could see past the birthmark and see what a wonderful little angel she is			2
' she 's always got a smile for everyone but she 'd feisty too			0
it 's her way or not at all			0
' she ca n't see very well as the condition also causes glaucoma , which can cause blindness			0
' the doctors ca n't tell us whether she will ever be able to see			0
' and she ca n't walk at all			0
but recently we have bought a special walking frame , so she 's taking her few steps in that			0
it does worry me how @entity3 is going to cope as she grows older			1
' other children can be so cruel and i want them to be able to see past the birthmark too			2
@entity3 is such a special person in our lives , and every day with her is a bonus			1
' recently she said " mummy " for the first time , and it was such an emotional moment			0
we know that her whole life has been such a fight for her			0
she can point to her dummy too , so she 's learning to communicate more			0
' she 'll be celebrating her third birthday this year , and it will be such a celebration for us			0
when she was born , we did n't even know whether she would survive a few hours			0
' but she 's proved everyone wrong			0
she was a fighter from the moment she arrived into the world and she 's carried on fighting ever since			0
she 's our little miracle			0
' the couple are fundraising for @entity61 where @entity3 was treated , and the @entity139 .			1
