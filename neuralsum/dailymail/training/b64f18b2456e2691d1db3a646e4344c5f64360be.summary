by @entity1 reporter published : 16:44 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 16:51 est , 6 december 2012 two men have become the first in @entity4 to be jailed for land banking fraud today after conning elderly and vulnerable people out of £ 3million			1
@entity7 , 33 , and @entity8 , 42 , masterminded the deception , conning people into buying plots of land that were either worthless or massively over-priced			1
a string of fraudulent companies were set up and sold land bought cheaply across @entity15 or plots they did not even own			1
first in @entity4 : @entity7 ( left ) and @entity8 ( right ) were jailed for seven and six years respectively for masterminding a £ 3million deception in a ' landmark moment ' for police in the fight to prevent fraud the locations were marketed as being in a prime position for development and would quickly increase in value			1
in reality , investors were putting their money into plots located on farmland , in the @entity36 , within an @entity26 or on the sides of hills , with no chance of gaining planning permission let alone building houses			0
some received small returns while others lost everything , with the duo funnelling off the funds into a network of bank accounts			0
over a two - year period , more than 300 victims fell foul of the gang			0
among the victims was an elderly man who was suffering from terminal cancer losing almost £ 300,000 and a retired woman who was conned out of £ 373,000			2
@entity7 , from @entity54 , north @entity55 , and @entity8 , from @entity56 , @entity57 , used virtual offices with @entity55 addresses and professionally - produced brochures and websites to legitimise their operation			1
cold - calling and high - pressure sale tactics were put into play to target and then bully people into buying into their scheme			2
by late 2009 , more and more investors were becoming concerned about the lack of returns from @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 , and were increasingly asking for their money back			0
no profit : prosecutor @entity77 told @entity78 ( pictured ) that ' only a miracle would produce a development opportunity , let alone a profit ' from the land the men claimed to be selling but following reports from numerous victims and a detailed @entity89 investigation , working closely with agencies including @entity91 and the @entity92 , a series of arrests were made in october 2009			2
@entity7 and @entity8 were jailed for seven and six years respectively at @entity55 's @entity93 today			1
commander @entity94 said : ‘ the @entity4 's first land banking fraud convictions is a landmark moment for all those committed to combating and preventing fraud , and sends out a clear message to the criminal community that law enforcement is wise to their new tricks and is taking decisive action			1
’ detective constable @entity104 , from the @entity89 , said : ‘ @entity7 and @entity8 preyed on the vulnerable , exploiting their desire to put their savings in something tangible that would provide them with long - term security			1
‘ they cared not from whom they stole , but only for what they could take			0
high - pressure sale tactics : the men targeted and bullied people into buying into the scheme , convincing people into buying plots of farmland ( stock picture ) that were either worthless or massively over-priced ‘ plots of land that were good for nothing and worth a fraction of the asking price were marketed as a sound investment with planning permissions in the pipeline and development round the corner			1
‘ the gang used all the tricks of the trade to give the appearance of legitimacy , picked off their targets over the phone and then disappeared without trace with their savings			0
‘ a complex and painstaking investigation by the @entity89 has ensured @entity7 and @entity8 have now been made to pay for the deception they created and the damage they caused			2
’ @entity77 , prosecutor for the @entity150 central fraud division , said : ‘ far from being ripe for development , one site in @entity152 was on a 40 - degree slope with @entity155 and a @entity158 @entity157 problem			0
‘ all the land consisted of undivided plots in fields ; only a miracle would produce a development opportunity , let alone a profit			0
’ land banking fraud has become increasingly prevalent in recent years , with fraudsters swapping shares in a company for plots of land as a way to entice people into making an investment			2
victims are led to believe the land is ripe for development and can only go up in value			0
the reality is that it is worth a fraction of what it is being marketed at , or even nothing at all , and the people they have trusted with their savings are , in fact , highly - skilled criminals .			0
