@entity0 and @entity1 made their peace at @entity4 – but the fans that came out to see them will have left feeling short - changed			1
the superstar pair gave each other an affectionate if slightly awkward embrace as they led their respective countries out for tuesday 's international friendly and shook hands again before kick - off as they tried to counter claims of a bitter rivalry between them			2
but there was great disappointment among supporters who had paid up to £ 60 - a - ticket that neither man re-appeared for the second half as the contest billed as grudge match petered out into a meaningless exhibition			1
@entity30 : : @entity52 6.5 , @entity53 6 , @entity54 6 , @entity55 5.5 ( @entity56 45 , 6 ) , @entity57 5.5 ( @entity32 , 6 ) ; @entity58 5 , @entity59 6 , @entity60 ( @entity61 45 , 5.5 ) , @entity57 6 ( @entity62 , 77 ) , @entity63 5.5 ( @entity42 68 , 5.5 ) , @entity0 7 ( @entity64 45 , 6 ) goals : @entity32 90 , booked : @entity59 , @entity66 referee : @entity68 ( @entity69 ) - 7			1
ratings by @entity71 at @entity4 an unapologetic @entity31 manager @entity72 said afterwards : ' it was always our plan to take him ( @entity1 ) off at half - time , ' while @entity77 boss @entity76 preferred to hail @entity0 's brief return to the club he graced between 2003 and 2009			1
' he is a legend here , one of many legends			0
i grew up watching @entity82			0
the club itself is a legend			0
' only 41,000 turned up at the so - called @entity4			2
those who suspected the showdown between the world 's best two players would turn out to be mere hype were proved right			0
the two icons did their bit for 45 minutes and then left the stage without a backward glance			0
without them the match descended into an exhibition and the only surprise was that @entity30 managed to score a half - decent goal to win the match in injury - time			1
two of the 11 substitutes used on a stop - start evening were heavily involved with @entity64 's cross from the left met with a diving header by left - back @entity32			2
@entity4 was n't packed to the rafters with the top tier shut off to reduce the stadium 's capacity to around 45,000			2
in the end , they could n't completely fill the remaining space anyway			0
even so , promoters @entity115 knew a global television audience would tune in to compare the two footballing icons of their generation and the only winners of @entity122 's @entity121 since 2007			0
it made for a terrific picture as the two famous men led their teams out side - by - side as rival captains			0
@entity32 headed home @entity64 's cross in injury time to seal victory for @entity30 @entity32 celebrates his last - gasp winner with his @entity30 team - mates at @entity4 @entity30 defender @entity54 celebrates with goalkeeper @entity52 after @entity32 's late winner at @entity4 @entity30 celebrate their winning goal ( left ) as @entity40 and @entity58 share a heated exchange ( right ) @entity0 was back on familiar turf as he returned to @entity4 , where he used to play with @entity138 @entity1 and @entity0 smile as they talk on the pitch at @entity4 during the first half both men seemed keen to end any hostilities between them , caused by allegations that @entity0 's associates refer to @entity1 as ' the dwarf '			1
they greeted each other in the tunnel , a friendly handshake accompanied by a mutual pat on the back and broad smile			0
@entity0 even reached over to briefly put his arm round @entity1 as a peace offering			1
the problem for @entity0 is that while he is comparable to @entity1 in terms of talent and status , his @entity30 side are grossly inferior to @entity31 as a unit			1
the @entity162 finalists hardly broke sweat and should have had the match wrapped up in the first 25 minutes			0
@entity165 , the £ 60million @entity167 record signing and not a bad supporting player to @entity1 , curled a low shot narrowly wide before the little magician tried an audacious attempt from an acute angle and hit the base of the post			1
@entity1 and @entity0 both lasted just 45 minutes at @entity4			1
here are their stats and heat maps			0
the @entity179 forward was withdrawn at half - time of the international friendly with the scores level @entity183 star @entity1 also played 45 minutes for the @entity162 runner - up @entity31 on tuesday night @entity45 then had a header saved at full - stretch by @entity52 before @entity1 curled a free - kick just over			1
the only worry for @entity31 – and watching @entity138 manager @entity189 – came when @entity47 had his foot stamped on by @entity58 , ironically still one of his players albeit on loan at @entity194			0
it was surprising that @entity47 was allowed to continue after finally getting to his feet and lasted an hour before he was replaced by @entity48			0
of course , any foothold @entity30 gained in the game was exclusively down to @entity0			2
he brought @entity4 to its feet by turning a couple of @entity202 defenders inside - out before firing over			2
@entity40 of @entity203 was then booked for blatantly body - checking @entity0 , naturally earning disapproval from the crowd			2
@entity1 reacts after missing a chance during the first half of the international in @entity36 supporters at @entity4 hold up signs saying ' welcome home ronaldo ' ahead of the clash at @entity4 in fact @entity138 fans seemed to be leaning towards supporting @entity30 despite @entity47 's presence			1
that said a lot about the popularity of @entity0 but also the four @entity203 players in @entity31 's squad with @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 on the bench , as well as former @entity225			0
those street traders selling half - and - half @entity1 and @entity0 scarves outside @entity4 might not have been aware that both men have scored 29 hat - tricks each in their careers			1
@entity1 led the personal head - to - head 12 - 7 in games played between them			2
but proof that this was n't comparable in importance with @entity236 or the @entity238 final came when neither @entity1 or @entity0 re-emerged for the second half as both countries embarked on a number of changes			1
@entity58 left @entity165 on the floor after a late challenge on @entity138 's £ 60m summer signing during the first half @entity47 looked to be in pain , but carried on after receiving treatment from medical staff at @entity4 @entity31 's medical staff attend to @entity47 after he was brought down by @entity58 during the first half @entity64 was the man who had to fill @entity0 's boots while @entity251 of @entity252 had the unenviable task of being the ' new @entity1 '			1
predictably , the intensity and atmosphere dropped significantly with the two main protagonists departed			0
@entity31 were marginally the better team but the crowd voted with their feet , literally , by standing to do a @entity260 wave for the last 15 minutes			0
despite the late winner , it was a damp squib of a friendly – but at least @entity0 and @entity1 are friends			1
@entity138 manager @entity189 ( left ) and former @entity266 boss @entity265 ( right ) in the crowd at @entity4			0

@entity32 scores only goal of the game in injury time at @entity4
both @entity0 and @entity1 were taken off at half - time in @entity36
*40,000* supporters watched the international contest at @entity4 on tuesday
@entity165 suffered an injury scare after a late tackle from @entity58 but was able to continue
