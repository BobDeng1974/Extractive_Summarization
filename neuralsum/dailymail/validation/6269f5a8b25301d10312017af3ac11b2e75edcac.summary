' ' that ’s right			0

' she would n’t spend a lot of time pecking out long letters			0
that ’s why the @entity52 needs to also look very closely at the emails on private accounts that @entity1 ’s closest aides , @entity56 and @entity57 , maintained			1
' ' anything more than a few lines were most likely written by someone else on her behalf , ' @entity7 continued			2
' there ’s a reason why @entity1 set up and used private emails with them for official business : all the important emails were likely written by her staff			2
without access to them , we wo n’t know what was going on			0
' a congressional panel is investigating the circumstances surrounding a 2012 terror attack on @entity77 facilities in @entity4 , @entity78 , while @entity6 was secretary of state			1
the revelation that she exclusively used a private email account – otuside the control or automatic archiving of the @entity25 administration – has fed @entity86 accusations that she hid her involvement in a post-attack cover - up in the weeks before the 2012 election			2
at least two aides , @entity57 and @entity56 , used personal email accounts on @entity6 's private server , kept at her @entity94 , @entity95 home			1

' moments after the @entity23 confirmed the meeting , @entity6 tweeted an old photo of her hugging @entity25 in the @entity131			1
the president has had a frosty relationship with his former top diplomat since 2008 when thetwo squared off for the @entity137 presidential nomination			0
it 's the aides , stupid ! email accounts of former state department chief of staff @entity57 ( left ) and her top deputy @entity56 ( right ) are where @entity4 - related emails likely lurk , says @entity7 the address : @entity56 had an email address on the former secretary of state 's private server , judging from records maintained by @entity149 @entity6 damaged his ambitious quest for the brass ring by starting the rumors that he was born in @entity153 and lacked a valid @entity43 birth certificate			1
the resulting conspiracy theories have dogged his presidency since @entity157			0
@entity6 's @entity159 message , though , defended key provisions of the president 's signature health insurance overhaul , which was an extension of her own failed attempt at reform while her husband was president			2
' repeal those things ? embrace them ! ' she tweeted			0
@entity7 has a checkered past			0
he famously resigned from @entity6 's 1996 campaign two months before @entity171 after it was revealed that he paid a prostitute for sex and let her listen in on his phone calls with the president			1
his most recent star turn came with a lengthy @entity179 contract which was n't renewed after he spectacularly blew his forecast for the 2012 presidential contest			0
@entity182 , the once famous pollster predicted , would coast to victory and unseat @entity25			0
but @entity7 has been a thorn in @entity1 's side since being bounced from her orbit in 1996			1
@entity188 - @entity188 : @entity6 joked about her email scandal on monday night at a journalism award dinnner : '' no more secrecy , no more zone of privacy			1

' ' @entity1 interned with @entity205 , the head of the @entity206 , ' for a year after her college graduation , he wrote			0
and ' she flunked the @entity99 bar exam and only passed the @entity210 bar			0
' @entity7 did not immediately respond to a request for comment			0
but he said sunday on a @entity95 talk radio program that ' when we talk about " @entity214 survive the email scandal ? " – it ’s just like asking in 1973 and 74 , " @entity218 survive the @entity32 tapes ? " ' ' by delaying the day of reckoning ' for all her private emails , he said , ' she 's risking shipwrecking not just her candidacy , but the entire [ @entity137 ] party			2
' ' i think @entity25 wants [ @entity228 ] @entity227 , not @entity1 , ' @entity7 added			2
