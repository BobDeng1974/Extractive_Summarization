people living in @entity2 cities will be used to colourful murals popping up overnight , but this could be the world 's geekiest graffiti			2
to the uninitiated , the wall art might show some nonsensical numbers and patterns , but it actually includes code alongside some of the world 's greatest technological minds , including @entity15			1
the artwork , which has been created in @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , challenges members of the public to break the codes to be in with a chance of winning tickets to a forthcoming technology fair			1
to the uninitiated , the wall art might show some nonsensical numbers and patterns , but it actually includes code alongside some of the world 's greatest technological minds , including @entity15 ( pictured ) the artwork , which has been created in @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , challenges members of the public to break the codes to be in with a chance of winning tickets to a big technology fair			1
a wall in @entity40 , @entity17 is pictured poor operational procedures and sloppy operator behaviour led to code breakers deciphering the @entity45 cipher machine used by the @entity46			1
the intelligence produced from decrypts at @entity49 was code - named ' @entity50 ' and helped the @entity51 defeat u-boats in the @entity53			0
cryptanalysts were chosen to work at @entity49 for various intellectual achievements , whether they were linguists , chess champions , crossword experts or mathematicians and in one instance , the ability to solve a @entity61 crossword in under 12 minutes was used as a test			0
@entity15 is arguably the most famous code - breaker to work at @entity49 and devised a number of techniques for breaking @entity68 ciphers , including the method of the bombe , an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the enigma machine			2
the graffiti contains undeciphered morse code , @entity77 and binary code that hides a secret message and is part of a bid to get young people interested in coding , which is essential to develop computer software and more			2
@entity15 , who is widely considered to be the godfather of computer science , is pictured in two of the urban murals as this month marks the 75th anniversary of the @entity89 and @entity91 ' arrival at @entity49			0
@entity15 and his team went on to break the enigma machine code used by the @entity46 at the top - secret location , in what many people consider to be a major turning point in @entity98			1
the graffiti also features present coding heroes who will speak at an event next week , including @entity102 who created pioneering video game company @entity103 and @entity105 who is executive director of operating system @entity106			2
the artwork was commissioned by technology festival and school for code - cracking , @entity112 , which will be held at the @entity113 in @entity17 on 2 to 7 september			1
the graffiti contains @entity75 , @entity77 ( pictured ) and binary code that hides a secret message and is part of a bid to get young people interested in coding			0
@entity120 , creator of @entity77 is pictured @entity15 , who is widely considered to be the godfather of computer science , is pictured in two of the urban murals as this month marks the 75th anniversary of the @entity89 and @entity91 ' arrival at @entity49			0
this mural is hidden in @entity126 in @entity17 and the code is binary available on the website as well as in hidden locations , people who crack the codes can win a pair of tickets to the event , which is designed to excite over 5,000 young people each day about digital and technological trends			1
it is hoped that events such as this one will help to develop hackers , developers , gamers and entrepreneurs of the future , in tandem with government initiatives such as @entity146			0
@entity147 , @entity112 manager at @entity113 , said : ' deciphering code has long been a role for some of the greatest minds the world has ever produced			0
the graffiti also features present coding heroes who will speak at @entity112 next week , including @entity155 ( pictured ) who is executive director of operating system @entity106 @entity102 ( pictured ) who created pioneering video game company @entity103 will also be speaking at the event ' at @entity112 we want to bring skills such as code breaking to the masses , broadening the digital skill base in the process			1
' this unique graffiti gives a taste of what we can expect to see during the festival , whilst providing a talking point that resonates and intrigues our key tech - savvy community			0
the festival will feature over 100 speakers and over 500 hours of content across five days			0
many people might find @entity176 's code the easiest to decipher ( pictured with an image if its creator )			2
the graffiti is designed to get people code - cracking and they can win tickets to @entity112 it is hoped the event and graffiti will help to inspire hackers , developers , gamers and entrepreneurs of the future			1
a mural of @entity191 alongside some @entity75 is pictured			0

graffiti invites people to crack @entity195 codes
the artwork includes images of code breakers and *inventors* @entity15 , @entity176 , @entity102 and @entity155
people who break the code can enter a competition to win tickets for technology fair @entity112
