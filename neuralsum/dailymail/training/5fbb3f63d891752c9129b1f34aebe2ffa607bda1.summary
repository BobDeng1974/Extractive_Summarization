by @entity0 this week , scientists officially announced that our hair colour is completely unrelated to personality and intelligence			1
the genetic mechanism that controls blonde hair , for instance , does n't alter the biology of any other part of the body or brain			2
did anyone really think there was serious proof that all those blonde jokes were true ? probably not			0
@entity0 says that going for a blonde colour could help a shy person become more confident but this still wo n't stop us making assumptions based purely on hair colour			1
because while it 's true the colour of hair we 're born with does n't dictate how bright , flighty or flirty we are , the colour we choose to be speaks volumes about how we 'd like to be seen			2
we know that if we 've got dark hair , we 'll be seen as more serious than someone who 's blonde , who 'll score high on sex appeal but not so great on intelligence or friendliness			0
if every redhead got a pound each time someone blamed an emotional outburst on their hair colour , most could retire by 40			1
every time we reach for a bottle of hair dye or instruct our hairdresser to add streaks of sunshine or warm , winter lights , we 're effectively tweaking our personality			2
our hair colour changes how others see us and treat us - and how we feel about ourselves			1
when @entity50 columnist and brunette @entity49 pulled on a peroxide white wig for a fashion shoot last week , she not only felt ' dangerously splendid ' she ' could already see that being blonde would change my life : that my hair would want to take me out to places and be noticed			1
' @entity0 says that opting for a different hair colour can dramatically alter your life hair colour is n't like inheriting @entity64 's large hips or short legs			1
we do n't have to shrug , say , ' oh well , mousy brown it is ' because there is something you can do about it			0
many women do n't accept what @entity72 doled out ( how many women over 21 do you know with virgin hair - hair that 's never been coloured or highlighted ? ) if you 've ever doubted how much hairstyle and colour influences personality , think back to the last fancy dress party you went to			2
you 're guaranteed good gossip the next day because people behave out of character			0
when we change our hair colour , we take on the personality stereotype that goes with it			1
if you 're shy or lacking in confidence , a switch from brunette to blonde could be just what you need to practice being a new , more adventurous you			0
dramatic colour change is also fabulous for forcing people to look at you afresh			0
fear you 're not being taken seriously at work ? turn up as a brunette with a smart new suit on , and things might change			0
want a jaded husband to see you anew or to turn a friend into a lover ? head for the hairdresser			0
there might not be a scrap of evidence to support the hair colour stereotypes but we 'll all continue to use it to our advantage anyway ! for more of @entity0 's views on love , sex and relationships , visit @entity115			1

this week it was proven that hair colour does n't *affect* personality
however *behaviour* expert @entity0 says that the colour we dye our hair can change our lives
for example , going blonde could boost your confidence
