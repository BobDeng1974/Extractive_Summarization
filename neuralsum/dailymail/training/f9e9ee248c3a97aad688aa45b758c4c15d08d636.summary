the @entity13 soap currently features the moving story of an older couple dealing with the news that their unborn child has the condition			2
in the show , @entity20 , who is in her mid-forties and pregnant for the first time , is adamant that she wants to go ahead and have the baby			1
the @entity7 fans were asked to vote on whether @entity26 ' ( right ) character - expecting a @entity10 's syndrome baby - should terminate the pregnancy that her husband on the show , played by @entity30 ( left ) , does not want but her husband @entity31 , a sixtysomething dairy farmer , feels it will be too much for them to cope with			1
some listeners have been in tears at the harrowing storyline and there has been praise for the sensitive way it has been handled			2
but fans who logged on to @entity7 website recently were taken aback to find a poll inviting a yes / no vote on whether the @entity20 character should have an abortion			1
the online vote was posted on the website on september 3 and remained in place for several days			2
critics claimed its blunt approach trivialised what is a ‘ life - changing decision ’ for many couples and was presented in a ‘ tasteless ’ way			2
in the show , 62 - year - old @entity31 , played by @entity30 , is distraught that his wife , played by @entity26 , appears to have made up her mind to go ahead with the pregnancy without considering his views			1

‘ i think to reduce it to a simple yes / no vote can be seen to trivialise what is a life - changing decision			0
‘ there is no easy answer in these circumstances and we do n’t think the @entity13 should promote the idea that the outcome of a difficult and painful decision should be based on the number of votes received by the public			0
’ in a letter to a national newspaper , @entity7 listener @entity101 wrote : ‘ it is understandable that the @entity13 should wish to explore this controversial plot line in the show , and indeed the story is being handled with some sensitivity ; yet to ask listeners to vote yes or no to the ending of an albeit fictional life seems tasteless			1
’ last night a spokesman for the programme apologised and admitted the poll was ill - judged			0
‘ the storyline has been well - received by the audience and raises a number of important issues , ’ the spokesman said			0
‘ however this issue is too complex and sensitive for an online poll and we regret any offence the poll may have caused			0
