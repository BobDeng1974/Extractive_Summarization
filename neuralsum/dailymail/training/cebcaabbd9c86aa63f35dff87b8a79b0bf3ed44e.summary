the 5:2 diet claims to not only help people lose weight , but also guard against diseases including cancer , diabetes and @entity6 's			1
created by scientist @entity8 , it involves women reducing their calorie intake to 500 for two days a week , and men to 600 calories			0
the rest of the time , they can eat normally			0
now a new study argues that the health benefits of 5:2 also exist when someone sticks to a ' feast and famine ' diet , eating far more than they would one day and fasting another			1

the rest of the time , they can eat normally intermittent fasting is an umbrella term for various diets that cycle between a period of fasting and eating normally			2
perhaps the most famous is the 5:2 diet which involves women reducing their calorie intake to 500 for two days a week , and men to 600 calories			0
the rest of the time , they can eat normally			0
previous animal studies suggest that intermittent fasting can guard against diseases including cancer , diabetes and @entity6 's			1
scientists believe it provides these benefits by allowing the body to respond better to stress that might otherwise damage it			1
for instance , fasting could reduce inflammation , or improve the removal of damaged molecules , as well as starve tumors , according to previous research			2
but the health benefits of the diet only appear if people do n't increase their intake of antioxidants , which can be found in high doses in superfoods such as chokeberries , as well as vitamin c and vitamin e supplements			1
during a three - week period , 24 participants alternated one day of eating 25 per cent of their daily caloric intake with one day of eating 175 per cent of their daily caloric intake			0
the study by the @entity67 measured the participants ' changes in weight , blood pressure , heart rate and glucose levels over 10 weeks			1
they also looked at cholesterol , markers of inflammation and genes involved in protective cell responses			0
' we found that intermittent fasting caused a slight increase to @entity81 3 , a well - known gene that promotes longevity and is involved in protective cell responses , ' said @entity84 , a co-author at @entity85			1
the @entity87 gene encodes a protein also called @entity87			0
the protein @entity87 belongs to a class of proteins called sirtuins which , if increased in mice , can extend their lifespans			0
researchers think proteins such as @entity87 are activated by oxidative stress , which is triggered when there are more free radicals produced in the body than it can neutralise with antioxidants			1
however , small levels of free radicals can be beneficial : when the body undergoes stress - which happens during fasting - small levels of oxidative stress can trigger protective pathways , @entity84 said			1
' the hypothesis is that if the body is intermittently exposed to low levels of oxidative stress , it can build a better response to it , ' @entity108 said			1
the researchers found that the intermittent fasting decreased insulin levels in the participants , which means the diet could have an anti-diabetic effect as well			2
to test antioxidant supplements , the participants repeated the diet but also included vitamin c and vitamin @entity122 at the end of the three weeks , the researchers tested the same health parameters			0
they found that the beneficial sirtuin proteins such as @entity81 and another , @entity127 , tended to increase as a result of the diet			1
however , when antioxidants were supplemented on top of the diet , some of these increases disappeared			2
a new study argues that the health benefits of 5:2 also exist when someone sticks to a ' feast and famine ' diet , eating far more than they would one day and fasting another			1
but only if people do n't increase their intake of antioxidants , which can be found in high doses in superfoods such as chokeberries ( pictured ) this is in line with some research that indicates flooding the system with antioxidants may counteract the effects of fasting or exercise , said dr @entity155 who was involved in the research			1
' you need some pain , some inflammation , some oxidative stress for some regeneration or repair , ' dr @entity155 said			0
' these young investigators were intrigued by the question of whether some antioxidants could blunt the healthy effects of normal fasting			2
' on the study participants ' fasting days , they ate foods such as roast beef and gravy , mashed potatoes , oreo cookies and orange sherbet - but they ate only one meal			2
on the feasting days , the participants ate bagels with cream cheese , oatmeal sweetened with honey and raisins , turkey sandwiches , apple sauce , spaghetti with chicken , yogurt and soda - and lemon pound cake , snickers bars and vanilla ice cream			0
' most of the participants found that fasting was easier than the feasting day , which was a little bit surprising to me , ' dr @entity84 said			2
' on the feasting days , we had some trouble giving them enough calories			0
' dr @entity155 said future studies should examine a larger group of participants and should include studying a larger number of genes in the participants as well as examining muscle and fat tissue .			0

fasting is thought to prevent diseases including cancer and diabetes
starving body allows it to respond better to stress that might otherwise damage it , according to a study on 24 *volunteers* over 10 weeks
it causes a small increase to @entity81 3 , a gene that promotes longevity
when antioxidants were added , some of the benefits disappeared
these can be found in high doses in superfoods such as chokeberries
