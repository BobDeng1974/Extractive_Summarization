@entity1 has the highest amount of atheists living in a single country with nearly 50 per cent of its population describing themselves as non-believers , a new survey has revealed			1
around 47 per cent of people living in @entity1 describe themselves as atheists compared to an average of 13 per cent across the world			1
a 2012 poll by @entity14 surveyed more than 50,000 people across 40 countries whether they considered themselves ' religious ' , ' not religious ' or ' convinced atheist '			1
survey : this map shows the percentage of people in different countries around the world who believe themselves to be atheists it is perhaps not surprising that @entity1 has the highest amount of atheists as its republic government was officially atheist when it formed in 1949			1
all temples temples and religious relics were destroyed during the @entity30 of 1967 to 1977 but the country did relax its religious policy with the @entity33 guaranteeing ' freedom of religion ' in @entity35			0
growing followers : but pope @entity37 has nothing to worry about as the numbers of people calling themselves in @entity41 has increased since 2005 the policy regarding religious practice in @entity1 states that ' no state organ , public organization or individual may compel citizens to believe in , or not to believe in , any religion ; nor may they discriminate against citizens because they do , or do not believe in religion			1
' since the mid- 1980s there has been a massive program to rebuild @entity53 and @entity55 temples			0
in recent times , the government has expressed support for @entity59 and @entity60 , organizing the @entity61 in 2006 and the @entity62 on the @entity63 in 2007			0
the government sees these religions as an integral part of @entity1 culture			2
there are five religions recognized by the state , namely @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity71 , @entity72 , and @entity73			0
but these figures appear to suggest that much of the skepticism surrounding organized religion in the country has survived			0
whereas in @entity79 , where a @entity81 taboo still remains , with 31 per cent still atheists			2
one of the most surprising figures in the @entity71 country of @entity85 where five per cent of the population described themselves as atheists , despite this being considered a crime			2
this compares to just one per cent in both @entity92 and @entity93 who describe themselves as atheists			1
and in @entity41 , the home of the @entity99 , support is still strong with nearly three - fourths of @entity41 consider themselves religious , which is actually up on 2005 's figures			0
earlier this week pope @entity37 has said atheists who are good are redeemed by @entity103 in a homily urging that people of differing beliefs work together			0
@entity14 / @entity107 notes that religion is strongest among the poor and the less educated , which correlates among the most religious countries			1
in @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 , more than nine in 10 people say they â€™re religious .			0
