@entity1 newspaper editor @entity0 , whose decision to publish @entity4 's stolen files has been criticised in @entity7 , the publication of the documents stolen by @entity4 is considered to have done more damage to the security services than any other event in history			1
feted as a hero by @entity1 , @entity4 said he wanted to start a public debate on the widespread use of eavesdropping techniques by @entity16 and his former employer , the @entity19 ( @entity19 )			1
but security officials are adamant there was no public interest in publishing top - secret information which details the precise methods used by agents to track terrorist plots			1
they argue that – by pointing out which internet service providers , phone companies and other technology firms can be effectively monitored by @entity16 – fanatics were signposted to the places they should avoid when communicating			0
@entity16 , in @entity33 , is the organisation which gathers intelligence for both @entity35 and @entity36 – if it is compromised , so is the entire security apparatus of the country			2
one government official said that , in effect , @entity1 had helped to produce a ‘ handbook ’ for terrorists			1
the internet is now rich with websites , based on the newspaper ’s revelations , that explain the best way to communicate , while avoiding detection			0
@entity7 insiders are scornful of the idea that @entity1 and @entity4 – who is now holed up in @entity52 , after a whistle - stop visit to the @entity55 territory of @entity56 – needed to start a debate on state surveillance			1
they point out that , for years , controversy has raged over ( so far unsuccessful ) attempts to give the security services and police more powers to spy on emails and internet visits , via the so - called snoopers ’ charter			0
thousands of classified documents about the @entity19 and @entity16 were published by @entity1 @entity69 : @entity4 during a press conference he gave in @entity71 , @entity72			1
he has sought sanctuary in @entity52 there is also anger at the depiction of @entity4 as a ‘ whistle - blower ’ by @entity1			2
he downloaded files indiscriminately , not knowing what they contained			0
but what most disturbs security officials is the knowledge that there are thousands more documents still in the possession of @entity1 , which – despite being warned of the grave threat to national security – continues to publish @entity4 ’s material			1
some of the information was so sensitive that @entity93 agents had to be moved for their own safety it is also highly likely that @entity55 and @entity52 hold the information , given @entity4 ’s attempts to seek sanctuary there			0
in august , @entity100 , deputy national security adviser at the @entity101 , warned the lives of @entity93 agents may have been put at risk by @entity1 journalist @entity104 and his partner @entity105			1
mr @entity105 was stopped by police at @entity107 on his way from @entity109 to the couple ’s home in @entity112			0
it later emerged that his flights had been paid for by @entity1 , and he was transporting nine hard disks and memory sticks , including secret files leaked by @entity4			2
some of the information – there were at least 58,000 documents in his possession – was so sensitive that @entity93 agents had to be moved for their own safety			0
mr @entity100 said the material was likely to contain details of secret techniques used to prevent terror attacks , personal data about agents at home and abroad and ‘ other intelligence activities vital to @entity93 national security ’			0
at the time , @entity0 , the editor of @entity1 , branded the claims ‘ unsubstantiated and inaccurate ’			2
he said the newspaper had ‘ held back a great deal ’ of information from @entity4 that might be harmful to @entity93 if it saw the light of day .			0

security officials say there was no public interest in @entity1 's expose
they also claim terrorists now know where and where not to communicate
