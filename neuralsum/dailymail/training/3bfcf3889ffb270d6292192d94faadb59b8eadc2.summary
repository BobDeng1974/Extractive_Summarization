looking at these pictures it is difficult how imagine how anyone could fail to love @entity3 the orangutan , but he had a troubled start to life after both his mother and surrogate mother rejected him			1
however the seven - month - old ape is now doing well having found love at the third time of asking after being given to @entity12 , a 53 - year - old @entity14 orangutan housed at @entity15 , @entity16			1
despite her advanced age , @entity12 has proved the perfect parent , having taken care of a surrogate baby once before until 2002			0
@entity34 , curator of primates and carnivores for the @entity15 , said : ' although it has been only a short time and we have a long road ahead of us , we are extremely optimistic due to @entity3 and @entity12 ’s progress so far			2
' @entity12 is an easygoing and gentle orangutan			0
the two have been together since @entity3 ’s arrival , and @entity12 has provided care and attention that he needs to receive from an orangutan			2
' @entity3 was born on january 11 at @entity47 in @entity48 to mother @entity22			1
while she has raised her own young before , following a difficult labour she showed little interest in caring for @entity3			1
keepers at @entity15 say the pair have shown promising behaviour since @entity3 arrived a month ago , with him often sleeping in the crook of @entity12 's arm @entity3 - whose name means ' little ' in @entity28 - will now spend a few months bonding with @entity12 away from prying eyes before being put on display after four months of effort by keepers trying to get @entity22 to care for her baby , staff decided it would be better to place the infant with another mother , and sent him to @entity66			1
he was given to an orangutan named @entity68 , but despite a month of work by staff , she also failed to bond with the youngster			0
as a last hope , he was moved to @entity16 and the capable hands of @entity12 , arriving at the zoo on june 20			2
since then the pair have shown promising behaviour by playing together , with @entity3 even riding around while clinging to @entity12 's forearm			2
but despite their progress , keepers say it will be a long time before either of them are put on display , as they need to be given time to develop their relationship , while @entity3 needs to become more agile in order to negotiate the exhibit			0
as well as playing together , @entity3 has also been spotted catching a ride on his surrogate mother 's forearm , leading keepers to believe there will be no more problems for the youngster staff at @entity15 say @entity12 is the perfect surrogate mother , as she is relaxed and calm			1
she has taken care of a child once before , though that ended in 2002 when the child grew up orangutans once lived over much of @entity100 , but their range and population have been dramatically reduced , mostly thanks to a reduction in habitat			0
there are thought to be as few as 40,000 @entity14 orangutans left in the wild , and the population has declined by 50 percent since 1990			0
researchers predict that about 5,000 orangutans die every year meaning the species will be extinct in the wild in the not too distant future .			0

@entity3 the orangutan was born at @entity48 's @entity47 on january 11
mother @entity22 showed no interest in caring for him after difficult labour
was moved to @entity120 but surrogate @entity68 also rejected him
