i - idiot : a man was caught watching a video on his @entity3 as he drove through @entity10 in @entity21 on sunday night ' at first i thought it was just another drink driver and as we pulled up beside him we saw he was watching tv , ' mr @entity13 told the @entity26 when he stopped beside the driver at a set of traffic lights , mr @entity28 ' wife asked the man if he realised how stupid he was being , but the driver just shrugged his shoulders and sped off			1

the witness who photographed the driver initially thought he was drunk because he was weaving in and out of traffic for about 12km ' there is no excuse for using an @entity3 , reading a book , using a mobile phone or engaging in any of the other distractions while driving a vehicle , ' @entity46 inspector @entity45 said			1
' if it 's convenient to use this type of the equipment on the road , then do offenders also think it 's convenient for their family to be told they 've killed someone else or themselves ?
