the founder of outlawed file - sharing website @entity2 launched his new online hub with a lavish ceremony at his £ 15.8m mansion , including a re-enactment of the police raid on his home , yesterday			1
@entity9 spoke from a giant stage at @entity11 in @entity12 , as he unveiled new site mega , which the millionaire said comply with the law , rendering it safe from being taken down			2
dotcom then compared last year 's raid to the iceberg which caused the titanic disaster , saying without it ' we would n't have a great titanic movie which makes me cry every time i see it			1
the controversial millionaire then ordered to ' stop this madness ' before breaking out into a dance alongside the ' guards '			2
the interest for @entity29 is already high , and @entity9 said half a million users registered in its first 14 hours			0
@entity9 said his new ‘ cyberlocker ’ was not revenge on @entity47 authorities , who are trying to extradite him and three colleagues from @entity50 , and last year closed @entity2 and charged him with online piracy for which he faces jail if found guilty			1
‘ this is not some kind of finger to the @entity47 government or to @entity59 , ’ @entity9 said at his sprawling @entity50 estate			1
‘ legally , there ’s just nothing there that could be used to shut us down , ’ he said			0
happy raiding : @entity9 poked fun at the police raid on his home last year with a cheeky re-enactment saying that he was glad it happened because ' without it we would n't have @entity29 ' @entity70 : mega was launched exactly one year after @entity2 was shut down and @entity9 was arrested in the world 's biggest online piracy case commander - in - chief : @entity9 , who claims then new site is not a ' revenge ' on @entity47 authorities who shut down his last venture , joined the fancy dress dancers in a jubilant boogie to celebrate the launch of @entity29 @entity9 said @entity29 was a different beast to @entity2 , as the new site enables users to control exactly which users can access uploaded files , in contrast to its predecessor , which allowed users to search files , some of which contained copyrighted content allegedly without permission			1
it offers 50 gigabytes of free storage , much more than similar sites such as @entity98 and @entity99 , and features a drag - and - drop upload tool			0
a sophisticated encryption system will allow users to encode their files before they upload them on to the site ’s servers , which @entity9 said were located in @entity50 and overseas			1
each file will then be issued a unique , sophisticated decryption key which only the file holder will control , allowing them to share the file as they choose			0
the decryption keys for uploaded files are held by the users , not the site itself , which means the company ca n't see what 's in the files being shared			1
@entity9 argues that @entity29 therefore ca n't be held liable for content it can not see			2
pleased : @entity9 's new site has already had a huge response , with 500,000 users registering in the first 14 hours unbreakable : dotcom insists the new site complies with the law and is therefore impossible to shut down turnout : guests , staff and media attended the launch at @entity9 mansion yesterday to hear @entity9 unveil the new site ‘ what he 's trying to do is give himself a second - string argument : ` even if i was wrong before , this one 's all right because how can i control something if i do n't know that it 's there ? ’ ' said @entity135 attorney @entity134 , who specializes in intellectual property law			1
‘ i can understand the argument ; whether it would be successful or not is another matter			0
’ he added that the launch is unlikely to have any impact on the @entity2 case			2
‘ all it might do is annoy them enough to say , “ we 're going to redouble our efforts in prosecuting them ”			0
but i do n't think it makes any practical difference to the outcome			0
’ the @entity157 , which filed complaints about alleged copyright infringement by @entity2 , was not impressed			0
‘ we are still reviewing how this new project will operate , but we do know that @entity9 has built his career and his fortune on stealing creative works , ’ the @entity157 said in a statement			0
‘ we 'll reserve final judgment until we have a chance to take a closer look , but given @entity9 's history of damaging the consumer experience by pushing stolen , illegitimate content into the marketplace , count us as sceptical			0
’ defiant : @entity9 is launching a new file sharing website called @entity29 exactly a year after the @entity173 shut down his old site @entity2 and charged him with online piracy new venture : dotcom insists his new offering , @entity29 , which will launch on sunday , complied with the law and warned that attempts to take it down would be futile the faux raid at the @entity29 launch re-enacted the police raid on @entity9 last year			1
last january , @entity50 ’s elite special tactics forces landed by helicopter at dawn in the grounds of @entity9 ’s mansion , worth roughly nz $ 30 million ( $ 25.05 million ) and featuring a servants ’ wing , hedge maze and life - size statues of giraffes and a rhinoceros , to arrest him and his colleagues at the request of the @entity173			1
police armed with semi-automatic weapons found @entity9 cowering alone in a panic room in the attic , while outside , a convoy of police cars and vans pulled up in the driveway			0
around 70 officers took part in the raid			2
tweets : dotcom announces the launch of new site mega on @entity212 they left with computers , files and some of @entity9 ’s fleet of @entity217 , @entity218 and a vintage pink cadillac tricked with personalised licence plates screaming ‘ @entity221 ’ , ‘ evil ’ , and ‘ mafia ’			1
' sometimes good things come out of terrible events , ' @entity9 said at the press conference which accompanied the launch , comparing the raid to the iceberg which cused the deaths of 1,502 people in the sinking of @entity233			1
' for example , if it was n't for a giant comet hitting earth , we would still be surrounded by angry dinosaurs - hungry , too			0
' if it was n't for that iceberg , we would n't have a great titanic movie which makes me cry every time i see it			2
and if it was n't for the raid , we would n't have mega			2
' @entity2 , started by @entity9 in 2005 , was one of the most popular sites on the internet until @entity47 prosecutors shut it down and accused him and several company officials of facilitating millions of illegal downloads .			0
