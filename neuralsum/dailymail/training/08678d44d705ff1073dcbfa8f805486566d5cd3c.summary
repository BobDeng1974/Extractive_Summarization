a @entity1 airman accused of aggravated assault for exposing multiple sex partners to @entity4 at swinger parties in @entity6 will have his appeal heard this week before the nation 's highest military court			1
the @entity10 will take up on tuesday in the case against @entity12 , an appeal the defense contends could upend similar prosecutions in the @entity17 military			1
' this case will have the potential of decriminalizing sexual contact with someone with @entity4 , ' defense attorney @entity18 said			1
landmark appeal : @entity6 airman @entity12 , who was jailed for eight years for failing to tell sexual partners he has @entity4 , will testify that medical advances in @entity4 treatment mean the laws are outdated @entity29 prosecutors have declined comment			1
@entity12 was a sergeant at @entity31 in @entity6 in 2011 when he was stripped of his rank and sentenced to eight years behind bars			1
in addition aggravated assault , @entity12 also was found guilty of violating an order to notify partners about his @entity4 status and to use condoms			1
he was also convicted of indecent acts and adultery			0
he has not been accused of actually infecting anyone with @entity4			2
in his appeal , @entity12 has challenged whether the risk to his sexual partners was high enough to constitute aggravated assault , arguing that laws covering exposure to the disease are outdated since the statistical probability of heterosexual transmission is low and medical advances have made the disease treatable			1
' about 100 years ago we used to have a lot of laws on the books that threw people in prison for having syphilis because you could n't cure it			0
once they came up with a cure a lot of those laws went along the wayside , ' @entity18 said			0
the risk of infection by an hiv - positive man during sexual intercourse with a woman varies widely , and each side in the case is citing the statistic within that range that is most favorable to their argument			0
defense lawyers say the risk of infection ranged from a 1 - in - 10,000 to 1 - in - 100,000 chance per sexual encounter , which they contend is so low that it does n't meet the legal standard for assault			2
@entity12 was a sergeant at @entity31 in @entity6 in 2011 when he was stripped of his rank and sentenced to eight years behind bars prosecutors , however , counter that the exposure risk was closer to 1 in 500			1
' a 1 - in - 500 chance of receiving a deadly , incurable disease is not merely fanciful , speculative , or remote possibility			0
it is a real possibility , " they wrote			0
' that real possibility of harm , when balanced with the magnitude of harm , certain death , provides more than enough justification to hold ( @entity12 ) criminally liable here			2
' government lawyers argued at trial that @entity12 played @entity107 roulette with his sexual partners ' lives and several people who had sex with @entity12 and his wife testified that they would not have done so if they had known he was @entity4 - positive			1
the government is playing up that testimony on appeal			0
the case could have a broad sweep , since defense attorneys in a similar case winding through the @entity121 appeals process have gotten involved with a rare friend - of - court filing			1
in that brief , defense lawyers said an ' epidemic of fear ' pervaded the nation in the in the mid- 1980s , when many of the applicable laws were written			0
they said that panic led to an expansion of criminal liability , and they urged the military appellate court to see @entity4 as a treatable condition			1
as of early this year , there had been more than 900 arrests or prosecutions in at least 38 states and the military of hiv - positive people accused of exposing others to the disease , according to the @entity144 of people living with @entity4			1
defense lawyers also say @entity12 should n't have been convicted of adultery since he and his wife participated in group sex			2
they also contend that their client 's due process rights have been violated by a long appeals process			0
@entity12 's wife @entity153 told investigators her husband became infected with @entity4 in 2007 while stationed at @entity156 , @entity157			1
it is understood that many of @entity12 ’s alleged victims were met through adult websites and at ‘ swingers ’ parties , with a police search warrant suggesting he attended 21 such events in 18 months			2
two women listed within court documents claimed to have chatted with him on swinging websites			0
both allege he did not inform them of his hiv before engaging in both oral sex and sexual intercourse			0
in his appeal , @entity12 has challenged whether the risk to his sexual partners was high enough to constitute aggravated assault one alleged victim said she first met @entity12 at a swingers party before performing a sex act on him			1
she also claimed that he took photos and videos of every sexual encounter			0
the other complainant claimed she engaged in sexual activity at @entity12 's home during over a @entity186 holiday			2
court records also claim that a large collection of pornographic videos were seized from his home as well as sex toys and other items			0
he was also reported to have posted a survey on a swingers website in 2007 asking whether respondents were willing to ' play ' with partners infected with herpes simplex virus ( @entity198 ) or @entity4			2
and in a follow - up post , he allegedly asked : ' why are people scared of the @entity4 virus , do n’t you wear condoms to protect yourself from @entity198 ? ' one woman to testify in his trial said that she and her husband had sex with both @entity12 and his wife @entity153 after meeting them at a swingers party			1
the woman said : ' my husband and i asked point blank , because we were clean			0
and @entity12 and his wife said no. they made a point to tell us they were both clean			2
' another woman , when asked whether she would have still have had sex with @entity12 knowing his @entity4 status , said : ' no , because i watched a brother die from @entity224			1
' the women , whose names have not been released , have not tested positive for @entity4			2
investigators previously recovered a cell phone , camera equipment and three laptop computers from his home			0
one of the women testified that she had asked @entity12 about whether he was @entity4 positive and he denied that he was positive			1
the victim said she believed him , saying : ' he 's @entity29			0
' @entity12 graduated from a high school in @entity239 before joining the @entity29			0
on his @entity241 wall , he described his philosophy as ' do unto others as they would do unto you ' .			0

the @entity10 will take up on tuesday in the case against @entity12
@entity12 was a sergeant at @entity31 in @entity6 in 2011 when he was stripped of his rank and sentenced to eight years behind bars
found guilty of aggravated assault and violating an order to notify partners about his @entity4 status and to use condoms
defense contends a *successful* appeal could upend similar prosecutions in the @entity17 military
