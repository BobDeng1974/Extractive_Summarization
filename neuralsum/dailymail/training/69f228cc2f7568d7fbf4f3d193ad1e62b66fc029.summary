if you ’ve ever dropped your smartphone you ’ll know that sinking feeling as you pick it up to find it ’s dented , scratched or even ruined			1
inspired by this , @entity5 car maker @entity4 has created a smartphone case with built - in airbags designed to prevent these kind of costly accidents			1
dubbed @entity11 , the phone accessory acts like a protective shell and if the handset is dropped , the six airbags immediately deploy			1
dubbed @entity11 , the phone accessory acts like a protective shell and if the handset is dropped , the airbags deploy , pictured although the @entity11 is just a concept , and @entity4 has said it has no plans to ever produce the product , a similar design was seriously suggested by @entity26			1
as discovered by @entity28 in march , an @entity26 patent was released for a case that tracks how close a phone is to hitting the ground , using built - in accelerometers			1
as the phone , and case , reaches the floor , gas - powered thrusters fire in the opposite direction to slow it down			0
however , the invention is just a concept and @entity4 does n't have any plans to sell the device			0
in a video for the concept , a @entity4 employee is shown looking forlornly at a picture of his cat through a scratched @entity47 screen			0
this gives him an idea and the engineer starts testing various inventions designed to protect his phone from being damaged when dropped – including dropping it from the top of a building			0
he eventually comes up with the idea for the @entity11 and tests out various prototypes			0
the final version is held up to the camera and as he drops the phone with protective case , slow - motion footage shows the airbags deploying			0

the accessory , dubbed @entity11 , can be *fitted* to any smartphone
when the phone is dropped , six built - in airbags inside the case deploy
this prevents the phone from being scratched , dented or stolen
sadly the airbag is a concept created by @entity4 and is n't available to *buy*
