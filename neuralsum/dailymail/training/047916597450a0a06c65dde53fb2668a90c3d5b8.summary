bookies , among them @entity188 and @entity189 , have suspended betting on the @entity148 revealing abdication plans in this year 's speech			2
although @entity193 sources have previously said the @entity148 will never step down , betting was halted following a flurry of surprise wagers			0
' throughout the year there has been major speculation about the @entity148 's future but the gamble has really caught us by surprise , ' said @entity189 's @entity202			2
' as far as we are concerned there 's no smoke without fire when bets like this come through all in succession , so we have decided to be safe rather than sorry and pull the plug on the market			0
' a @entity193 spokesman refused to comment , but did point to the pledges made by the @entity148 in her 21st birthday speech in 1947			0

' although it is rare for @entity67 monarchs to step aside , with @entity239 the only monarch to do so , the practice is considerably more common in @entity240 , where no less than four have stood down in the last two years			0
2013 was the busiest year for abdications , with queen @entity242 , @entity243 of @entity244 and pope @entity245 all stepping down			0
the following @entity246 , @entity247 of @entity248 , 76 , announced plans to step down on the grounds that ' i do n't want my son to grow old waiting like @entity253 '			0
he formally abdicated on the 18th june , making him the fourth @entity240 monarch to do so in less than a year			0
despite the flurry of abdications , the @entity148 has always stated that she has no plans to do the same , despite being older than all of the four			0
one monarch who may yet do so is @entity261 's @entity260 , 74 , who has been on the @entity261 throne for 42 years and has an heir , @entity263 , of the same age as 46 - year - old @entity265			0
however , despite claims in an @entity270 magazine that an announcement is imminent , sources close to the @entity261 queen have said she has no intention of stepping down and described the reports as ' all lies '			0
