ever wondered what your offspring actually sees while being pushed around in their buggy ? well , one family visiting @entity6 got to find out after they strapped a @entity9 camera to their son 's pram - producing an incredible tot 's - eye view of the city			1
@entity15 , 32 , spent more than five weeks studying in the city and captured everything his one - year - old son @entity18 saw from his seat when he arrived for a holiday			1
above shows the snap captured by the @entity9 camera attached to his buggy the tot 's pram provided an original vantage point on one of the world 's most photographed cities ... and @entity18 enjoyed his sightseeing tour with a @entity37 toy by his side when the digital photography student , visiting from @entity40 in @entity41 , looked back at what the ' pramera ' had caught , he found a stunning array of snapshots , perfectly capturing the @entity47 's iconic sights from a fresh perspective			1
among the slideshow of sights were shots of a damp - looking @entity52 - pictured through the buggy 's raincover ; @entity55 in all its tree - lined splendour and a shot of a commuter dozing off on the @entity60			1
@entity18 even got a glimpse of @entity6 's famous billboards , with a denim - clad female model clearly caught through the lens			1
snap - happy @entity65 received a grant from the @entity41 government to help him study for a master 's degree in digital photography at the @entity71 in @entity6 - moving away from his native @entity41 to study			1
he started the series when his family came to visit him in @entity6 for the first time			0
@entity75 ( left with a snoozing passenger ) passes @entity18 some much needed snacks while riding the @entity60			1
@entity78 and @entity79 ( pictured right ) took the images while @entity65 was studying in the city @entity65 said : ' i first visited @entity6 in 2007 and felt a strong connection to the city			0
i loved the visual richness of @entity87 ... along with all of the cultural places			0
' during one class my teacher , @entity89 , suggested i put the camera inside the chair so i just set up it and i gave it a lot of rides			2
' i found that the @entity9 is a wonderful tool to document everything you want - it is easy to handle and it adapts to everywhere			0
he added that the project was n't technically difficult but finding the perfect position for the camera was trickier			2
' the time was challenging - trying to choose the best images in the most iconic places and at the same time dealing with classes and the rest of other final projects was tough			0
' it 's hard to choose my favourite , but i feel that the image where @entity18 is looking at an empty box of chocolates and the background is this beautiful view of a forest with reflections over the lake is incredible			2
' it gives life from a child 's perspective - he only cares about the chocolate and not the view or even the park - he just want more chocolate			1
@entity55 's beautiful foliage is enticing but @entity18 seems more interested in the chocolate wrapper that he 's holding			2
@entity130 said : ' he only cares about the chocolate and not the view or even the park			0
' more inclement weather in @entity52 means @entity18 sees the bright lights of @entity87 's most famous tourist spot through a plastic cover sights and sounds : the @entity9 captures a marching band of @entity6 drummers passing by with sparkling tree lights in the background no - one is safe from @entity145 advertising : @entity6 's huge billboards , featuring a beautiful model , are snapped by the pram camera @entity65 said : ' the pushchair series was my final project for the editorial art class			1
last semester , i was trying to tell the relationship between my son , @entity18 , and his first experience of visiting @entity6			2
' at the beginning of this project my images were from outside the pushchair but i felt that the story was not strong enough			0
' most of the viewers have liked the images for their unique and original point of view			0
' they give a truly unique perspective and i think that the images get people inside the pushchair too			0
' i also believe that parents mainly love the images because now they know how their children perceive the world			0
