@entity1 general secretary @entity0 has defended the expansion of the @entity3 , insisting more teams and multiple host countries will ' inject the virus of football ' throughout the continent			1
the championship has been expanded from 16 to 24 teams for @entity11 while the 2020 tournament will be held in 13 different countries			1
the new format for 2020 is a one - off measure to celebrate the 60th anniversary of @entity18 competition but there is concern that multiple host nations will reduce enthusiasm and atmosphere during the event			0
' we always have great parties when the euros are hosted in one country but now our ambition is to organise a @entity28 for @entity1			1
' we want to inject the virus of football in the whole of @entity1			1
' in the 13 cities , people will feel the @entity28 belongs to them and it gives countries who have never hosted , the chance to host			2
' they have the chance to build a new stadium and boost the development of football in their own country			0
' @entity49 's @entity48 has won the right to host both the semi-finals and the final at @entity53 but other , less renowned football cities , will hold matches including @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58 in @entity59 and @entity60 in @entity61			0
@entity48 in @entity49 has won the right to host the semi-finals and final at @entity53 none of those three cities have ever held a @entity18 finals fixture before but there is concern that local interest will dwindle if host countries are knocked out or fail to qualify			2
' even if the national team do not participate i think there will be an enthusiasm for hosting a @entity3 , ' @entity0 said			2
' these are countries who have never organised a @entity53 and who would never be able to organise a @entity53			0
' and we have seen in the @entity28 before when host teams go out there is still an enthusiasm for the games			0
' adding eight more countries to the 2016 finals means two sides now automatically qualify , with third - placed teams earning a play - off spot			2
@entity90 's @entity89 has been upgraded with a capacity of 67,500 and will host matches in @entity11 the changes have given more hope to sides previously unlikely to go through but it has also reduced the competitiveness of the qualification stage for more established countries			1
' the effect of 24 teams qualifying makes almost all the teams think they have a chance to qualify and that has created a new dynamic , ' @entity0 said			1
' we saw @entity105 beating @entity106 , the @entity107 beating the @entity108 , @entity109 beating @entity110 in @entity111			0
' it creates a new dynamic and it can make the qualification process even more interesting			0
' @entity0 added : ' you develop football in @entity1 not only by developing football in a couple of countries but by making sure the whole of @entity1 feels integrated			1
' of the top 32 teams in the world , 20 are @entity18 so the quality of football in @entity1 is there			1
' @entity0 addresses his audience at the leaders in @entity127 conference in @entity49 on thursday			0

the tournament for @entity11 has been expanded from 16 to 24 teams
the 2020 tournament will be held in 13 different countries across @entity1
