‘ a cold nose in the crotch can be effective			0
‘ when you do something wrong always take responsibility as soon as you are dragged out from under the bed			0

' i 've just had a dreary bout of vertigo with the inside of my head seeming to spin ceaselessly in an outer bony shell of a head which never moved ( as i fell sideways against the wall like a drunk - ' see you soon love @entity15			1
' the words were accompanied by a cheery drawing of a ' @entity37 '			0
the letter to the alleged victim 's father read : ' dear [ the father ] , ' please forgive me for not writing sooner			1

' since that trip up to @entity107 , i have been in a state of abject self loathing			0
' i fondly imagined that everything that had taken place had progressed from a feeling of love and friendship - there was no rape , no physical forcing , brutality or beating that took place			2
' when i came to @entity107 , spent that time with [ alleged victim ] and realised the enormity of what i had done ' ' please forgive me , love @entity15 ' : the letter sent to the father of the girl who claims she was abused for 16 years ' when i came to @entity107 , [ the alleged victim ] told me that she had always been terrified of me and went along with everything that i did out of fear of me			1
' i said ' why did you never just say no ? '			0
and [ the alleged victim ] said how could she say no to the great television star @entity1			1

' she laughs in a bitter way and says i must have known that she has always been scared of me			0
i honestly did n't know			0
' [ the alleged victim ] keeps saying that this has all been going on since she was 13			1
she 's told you that and you were justly horrified , and she keeps reiterating that to me , no matter what i said to the contrary			0

i hope she did , but i fear she can never forgive me			0
' i find it hard to like myself in any way , shape or form			0

if there is a way i can start to help [ the alleged victim ] to heal herself , i would willingly do it			2
