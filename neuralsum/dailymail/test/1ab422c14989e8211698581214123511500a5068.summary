@entity0 has set his sights on the @entity3 batting line - up and is ready to ' rough them up ' with pace			1
the 29 - year - old @entity7 seamer is back in test contention in the @entity9 after his comeback last summer was cut short by injury			1
he managed 18 wickets in four tests prior to that , playing a big part for an @entity7 side often criticised for going easy on the speed gun			1
@entity0 wants to use his pace to lead @entity7 to victory in the test series against @entity3 @entity0 returned to the @entity7 fold last summer in @entity20 against @entity22 and @entity23 @entity0 has recovered from a minor ankle complaint in @entity26 's pre-season trip to @entity27 a minor ankle complaint during @entity26 's pre-season trip to @entity27 proved to be nothing more than a brief setback and he is now looking to make a name for himself in a part of the world that is famous for its quick men			1
' i 'm trying to be the fastest ( bowler on the pitch )			1
i train hard at it and i feel that 's why i stand out from the rest , ' he said ahead of monday 's two - day warm - up against a @entity43 ' i feel like i 'm adaptable but you might need those little patches in the game - where it 's a bit dead and there 's good batters - to try and rough them up a bit			2
' that 's why i 'm in the team , because i do bowl fast			2
' i 'm not a bowler who runs up and just hits line and length all day , i want to do something , i want to ruffle batsmen up			2
if that 's what i 'm asked to do , i 'm happy to do that			2
' with @entity62 and @entity63 likely to retain new ball duties for the first test in @entity66 on april 13 , @entity0 is fighting for a place with @entity69 - born @entity68 and the uncapped @entity70			1
there is a case to be made for both his rivals , @entity68 being more familiar with conditions in his homeland and @entity70 an unknown quantity to the opposition , but @entity0 relishes the scrap			1
' it 's a good unit , a good bunch of lads and we 're all working hard			0
there 's massive competition , ' he said			0
' it 's up to me to bowl well in practice and in the warm - up games and get the chance to play in the first test			0
' you do n't want to just get in easily			0
you want to feel like you 've earned your place and outbowled the other guys			0
you want to be the best bowler			0
' last summer i felt the best i had in my career , i felt good with the ball , i felt confident			0
@entity0 is fighting for a start in the @entity100 side with @entity68 and @entity70 @entity0 ( second left ) could feature in a warm - up game for @entity7 that begins on monday ' i felt i was in a situation where i could win games for @entity7			1
it did n't quite happen but i bowled nicely			0
' then i got the injury , went away this winter with the @entity106 and i feel good again			1
i got some wickets and some good rhythm so it would be good to play that first test			0
' @entity7 plan to play a standard xi man fixture on monday , with their selection likely to provide a clear insight into their preferred test side .			0
