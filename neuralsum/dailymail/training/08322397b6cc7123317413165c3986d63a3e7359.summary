by @entity0 last updated at 12:52 pm on 25th october 2011 women who carry @entity2 are more than twice as likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke than those who test negative , a study shows			1
researchers at the @entity14 discovered those who test positive for @entity2 - one of the most common sexually transmitted infections - are also at greater risk from heart disease			1
although long - term studies are needed to confirm the link , scientists are already citing the hpv vaccine as a preventative measure			0
the hpv vaccine protects against two types of human papilloma virus that are responsible for 70 per cent of cervical cancer			0
data from around 2,500 women between the ages of 20 and 59 was gathered from a 2003 - 2006 @entity31 national health survey and @entity32			0
in total 44.6 per cent carried some form of @entity2 while 23.2 per cent had the cancer - causing strains of the virus			2
after assessing medical history and lifestyle patterns the team discovered the two well known ' cancer - causing ' strains of @entity2 were ' strongly associated ' with heart disease			1
women who tested positive for any of the 37 strains of the virus were 2.3 times more likely to have had either a heart attack or stroke while women who tested positive for cancer - causing strains had 2.86 times the risk of heart disease			1
lead author dr @entity52 said : ' i thought there would be a weak link between hpv and cardiovascular disease , but i did n't expect [ the risk ] to be 2.3 times as high			2
' jab : girls in the @entity61 are offered a vaccine against two major strains of @entity2 that are known to cause 70 per cent of cervical cancer cases the study published in the @entity66 , was aimed at discovering why almost 20 per cent of those who develop heart disease do not present traditional risk factors , such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure			1
dr @entity52 said that the new research indicates that @entity2 could be the nontraditional factor responsible			0
he added : ' this is very first study to link @entity2 with [ heart disease ]			1
' however , our data suggests those patients should be followed more closely by their doctors â€” if [ they ] have chest pain , take it very seriously			0
' the hpv vaccine may also help prevent heart disease			1
' dr @entity85 , medical director at @entity86 told @entity87 : ' it is great that researchers are thinking out of the box to assess cardiovascular risk in women			0
' if more studies confirm these new research findings linking @entity2 to cardiovascular disease , this would be an additional tool for doctors to assess a women 's cardiovascular risk			2
' it would also get younger women to take their hearts seriously			0
' currently in the @entity61 the hpv vaccine called @entity104 is offered to children aged 12 to 13 at school .			0
