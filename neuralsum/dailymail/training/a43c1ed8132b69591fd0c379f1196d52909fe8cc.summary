it might look like a giant eye in the sky , or something from a science fiction fiction film , but in fact this incredible image reveals just how violent planet formation is			1
captured by the @entity9 , it shows the huge dusty debris discs around stars			1
created by collisions between leftover objects from planet formation , were imaged around stars as young as 10 million years old and as mature as more than 1 billion years old in @entity17 's images			1
captured by the @entity9 , this image shows the huge dusty debris discs around a star called @entity21 , showing a huge spray of debris possibly caused by the recent collision of two bodies into the outer part of the system			1
irregularities observed in one ring - like system in particular , around a star called @entity21 , resemble a huge spray of debris possibly caused by the recent collision of two bodies into the outer part of the system			1
in those cases , collisions between planet - sized bodies cast debris that then coalesced into a companion moon			1
the suspected planet collision seen in the disk around @entity21 may be similar to how the @entity41 formed			1
“ it ’s like looking back in time to see the kinds of destructive events that once routinely happened in our solar system after the planets formed , ” said survey leader @entity42 of the @entity44 's @entity43			1
the survey ’s results appeared in the oct. 1 , 2014 issue of @entity55			0
once thought to be simply pancake - like structures , the unexpected diversity and complexity and varying distribution of dust among these debris systems strongly suggest the disks are gravitationally - affected by unseen exoplanets orbiting the star			1
alternatively , these effects could result from the stars passing through interstellar space			2
the researchers discovered that no two " disks " of material surrounding stars look the same			2
“ we find that the systems are not simply flat with uniform surfaces , ” @entity42 said			0
“ these are actually pretty complicated three - dimensional debris systems , often with embedded smaller structures			2
' some of the substructures could be signposts of unseen planets			0
" the astronomers used @entity9 ’s @entity79 to study 10 previously discovered circumstellar debris systems			2
irregularities observed in one ring - like system in particular , around a star called @entity21 , resemble a huge spray of debris possibly caused by the recent collision of two bodies into the outer part of the system			1
. “ this spray of material is fairly distant from its host star — roughly twice the distance that @entity95 is from the sun , ” said co-investigator @entity90			0
“ catastrophically destroying an object that massive at such a large distance is difficult to explain , and it should be very rare			0
' if we are in fact seeing the recent aftermath of a massive collision , the unseen planetary system may be quite chaotic			0
” though astronomers have found nearly 4,000 exoplanet candidates since 1995 , mostly by indirect detection methods , only about two dozen light - scattering , circumstellar debris systems have been imaged over that same time period			2
over the past few years astronomers have found an incredible variety in the architecture of exoplanetary systems – planets are arranged in orbits that are markedly different than found in our solar system , “ we are now seeing a similar diversity in the architecture of the accompanying debris systems			1
“ how are the planets affecting the disks , and how are the disks affecting the planets ? there is some sort of interdependence between a planet and the accompanying debris that might affect the evolution of these exoplanetary debris systems			0
” from this small sample , the most important message to take away is one of diversity , @entity42 said			0
though astronomers have found nearly 4,000 exoplanet candidates since 1995 , mostly by indirect detection methods , only about two dozen light - scattering , circumstellar debris systems have been imaged over that same time period			0
that ’s because the disks are typically 100,000 times fainter than , and often very close to , their bright parent stars			0
the majority have been seen because of @entity9 ’s ability to perform high - contrast imaging , in which the overwhelming light from the star is blocked to reveal the faint disk that surrounds the star			0
the new imaging survey also yields insight into how our solar system formed and evolved 4.6 billion years ago			0
