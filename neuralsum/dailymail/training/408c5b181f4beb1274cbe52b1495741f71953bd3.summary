new cure : a probiotic drink derived from a @entity4 pickle could help prevent flu , a study suggests a probiotic drink made from a traditional @entity4 pickle could help prevent flu , scientists have discovered			1
new research has suggested that the immune - boosting powers of @entity13 bugs found in @entity4 pickled turnip , or @entity15 , could help fight the virus			1
it is thought that the bacteria might even prevent more virulent strains of flu such as @entity21 and thedeadly h7n9 avian flu which recently emerged in @entity23			2
a probiotic drink which contains the @entity26 strain of the bug is now being tested on humans having tested it on mice			1
fans of the vegetable have long claimed it has superfood properties but only now are scientists testing the pickle in the lab. @entity38 , from the @entity4 food company @entity39 , which carried out a study into the bacteria , said : ' our results show that when a particular strain of @entity46 is eaten by mice , it has protective effects against influenza virus infection			2
' the findings of the study have been published in the journal @entity53 in @entity54			0
a protective layer of sugars called exopolysaccharides that protects the bacteria against acid stomach juices could lie behind its powers , the @entity4 researchers believe			0
ms @entity38 said : ' we know that exopolysaccharides have immune boosting effects in other similar bacteria , so we wonder if the exopolysaccharides of @entity26 are responsible for the effects we see			2
' wonder cure ? bacteria found in @entity4 pickled turnip could help to prevent flu in the mouse study , the bacteria led the rodents ' immune systems to create more flu - fighting antibodies			1
scientists hope that the research may lead to a new range of flu - fighting foods containing the bacteria to become available on the market			0
last month scientists predicted that a new ' @entity84 ' flu vaccine which gives lifelong protection against all strains of the virus could be available within five years			0
scientists from @entity89 and @entity90 were said to be getting ready to start large scale trials of a universal vaccine after early successful tests on humans			1
the trial programme received a multi-million pound @entity97 grant to fund research			0
strong stuff : the bacteria could even prove effective in combating more virulent strains of flu such as bird flu or swine flu			0
