by @entity0 published : 12:23 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 15:28 est , 14 december 2012 life expectancy around the world has soared , but we are now living with health problems that cause us years of pain , disability and mental distress			1
this ' devastating irony ' , as researchers describe it , is one of the key findings of a landmark study assessing the global health in the history of medicine			1
from 1990 to 2010 , life expectancy continued to increase in most parts of the world			1
the average age of death rose from 59 to 70 , with women outliving men by about five years			1
the map below highlights the average life expectancy by area , with @entity27 and @entity28 having the oldest populations			1
@entity32 life expectancy map the map shows the average life expectancy for men around the world in 2009			1
the overall global life expectancy has risen from 59 in 1990 , to 70 today however , as the population has aged , the number of years that people live with chronic diseases and disabilities , such as back pain , diabetes , arthritis and depression , has also risen			1
today 's major health problems now are diseases and conditions that do n't kill , but make us ill. we now live longer with more health problems that cause pain , impair mobility , and prevent us seeing , hearing and thinking clearly			1
these consequences of an ageing population were compiled by researchers from more than 300 institutions from 50 countries around the world			0
they took data from surveys , censuses and hospital records and used computer models to estimate how long people live and how healthy they are			0
smoking and alcohol use have also overtaken child hunger to become the second and third leading health risks the @entity71 study , led by the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) at @entity73 , found that countries face a wave of financial and social costs from rising numbers of people living with disease and injury			1
among other findings are that while malnutrition has dropped down the rankings as a cause of death and illness , the effects of excessive eating are taking its place			2
smoking and alcohol use have also overtaken child hunger to become the second and third leading health risks , behind high blood pressure			2
over three million deaths globally were attributable in 2010 to excess body weight , more than three times as many as malnutrition			2
' we 've gone from a world 20 years ago where people were n't getting enough to eat to a world now where too much food and unhealthy food - even in developing countries - is making us sick , ' said @entity105 of @entity106 , one of the lead researchers			0
the research also found that of 52.8 million deaths globally in 2010 , chronic diseases took the highest tolls			0
about 12.9 million deaths were due to stroke and heart disease - conditions exacerbated by eating and drinking too much , smoking and taking too little exercise - and eight million were from cancer			0
@entity119 / @entity118 killed 1.5 million people in 2010 , and tuberculosis , another infectious disease , killed 1.2 million			0
while child mortality has decreased , there has also been a startling 44 percent increase in the number of deaths among adults aged 15 to 49 between 1970 and 2010			0
this is partly because of increases in violence such as homicide and traffic accidents and the @entity118 epidemic , the researchers said			0
' very few people are walking around with perfect health , and as people age , they accumulate health conditions , ' said @entity140 , the @entity72 's director			2
' this means we should recalibrate what life will be like for us in our 70s and 80s			2
it also has profound implications for health systems as they set priorities			0
' the study , was funded by the @entity151 and published as seven papers in @entity154 medical journal .			0

from 1990 to 2010 , the global average age of death rose from 59 to 70 , with women outliving men by about five years
@entity27 and @entity28 have the longest life expectancy , while @entity162 and @entity163 are among the lowest
but living longer means we are suffering health problems that cause us years of pain , disability and mental distress , says landmark study
