@entity0 scored both goals in @entity3 's 2 - 1 win at @entity4 on monday night , but the game 's statistics at @entity8 's make for alarming reading for @entity11 's side			1
@entity3 were poor for large patches of the match and this was highlighted by the fact they only managed to muster three shots throughout - and all from the left - foot of @entity19			2
the trio of strikes from the @entity22 is the lowest recorded by the @entity23 in any @entity25 game since august 2003 , as well as by any side in @entity28 's top flight this season			1
@entity0 scored twice from three shots - the only efforts @entity3 managed all match @entity19 , pictured with @entity33 ( left ) and @entity34 ( right ) celebrates after scoring the opener under @entity37 it seems @entity3 are still searching for the right tactic to employ as the club ’s crippling injury list continues to force the 63 - year - old 's hand when it comes to picking his strongest xi. the inconsistency in his team selection is clearly hampering the attacking flow of his charges and this was exemplified by the fact the @entity23 only had six touches in the opposing penalty box over the course of the 90 minutes - 26 fewer than the @entity4			1
what 's perhaps more surprising is the fact that @entity58 - a striker who cost @entity3 £ 6million to bring to @entity59 for a season on loan and who they would need to stump up another £ 40m to sign next summer - remained firmly on the bench despite the lack of firepower up front			2
@entity3 boss @entity37 said before the match that @entity58 can ' only play for 20 minutes ' due to a lack of ' match fitness ' , and clearly he decided the @entity70 could not be risked at @entity8 's			2
and this despite the fact @entity58 's wife @entity72 posted on her @entity74 account a picture of the striker training with the caption : ' 100 % ready to give everything ! ! ! '			0
@entity37 's counterpart @entity79 was flabbergasted at how his side lost the match , but was quick to acknowledge the predatory instincts of @entity19			0
@entity19 helped @entity3 claim all three points against @entity4 at @entity8 's but @entity11 's side registered the fewest number of efforts on goal in the @entity25 this season @entity3 had @entity58 on the bench but @entity37 did not opt to use him despite his side 's lack of shots the 31 - year - old 's second saw him register his seventh goal in as many games against the south coast outfit and took his career tally to 140 @entity25 strikes - making him the 10th player in history to achieve the feat. despite @entity3 's fortuitous win , the three points move the @entity59 club to third in the @entity25 as they recorded five league victories in a row for the first time since winning seven on the spin in march 2013			1
that year , @entity3 won the title			0
although they are a long way from achieving that feat this campaign , @entity37 wo n’t care if his side can continue their run by merit or by fortune			0
@entity3 captain @entity114 ( right ) puts his hands on his hips as @entity19 looks on @entity114 ( right ) failed to register a single shot during the match at @entity119 on monday			0

@entity3 beat @entity4 2 - 1 at @entity8 's on monday night
but the @entity23 managed just three shots on goal all game
@entity0 took all of those shots , scoring with two of them
it 's the lowest number of shots a @entity25 side 's had this season
it is also fewest shots @entity3 have managed in a game since august 2003
