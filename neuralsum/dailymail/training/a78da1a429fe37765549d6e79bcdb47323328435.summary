she lost in the fourth round at the @entity77 , the second round at the @entity79 , and the third round at @entity81 , where a disoriented @entity2 also struggled through an odd appearance in doubles that was attributed to a viral illness			0
back at the top of her game , @entity2 broke @entity8 's serve five times and compiled a hard - to - believe 29 - 4 edge in winners			1
remarkably , until a cross-court backhand on the run in the final game that even @entity2 applauded , the only winners registered by the 10th - seeded @entity8 came on a trio of aces , one in the first set , two in the second			2
that was , in part , a result of the @entity102 's iffy play in only her second @entity4 final — she lost to @entity104 at the @entity105 — but more due to @entity2 ' relentless pursuit of every ball			0

@entity8 is the one training for the @entity113 , but @entity2 tired her out by the end			2
@entity8 was not exactly an extra in this @entity2 highlight reel , but pretty close to it			2
the points were being directed by @entity2 , whether via serves that reached 120 mph ( 194 kph ) , forceful returns that backed @entity8 into a corner when not producing outright winners , unreachable groundstrokes from all angles or even the occasional volley			0
