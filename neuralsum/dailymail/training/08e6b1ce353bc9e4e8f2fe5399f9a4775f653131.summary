all of a sudden , @entity0 have gone from looking ahead to a title race to glancing nervously over their shoulders in the chase for a @entity5 spot			1
the seven - point advantage that @entity7 have opened up over the @entity9 champions is the same gap that now exists between @entity0 and @entity11 in sixth			1
@entity12 lead the pack of clubs breathing down their necks			0
@entity17 midfielder @entity16 scored the opening goal of the game as they took an unlikely 1 - 0 lead at @entity0 @entity22 scores the equaliser from a free - kick but it is not enough for @entity0 to earn a win @entity22 ’s late equaliser ended his run of 36 league games without a goal			1
city have failed to win in their last five games , including home defeats by @entity11 in the league and @entity35 in the @entity36			1
it represents their worst run since late 2009 when the ‘ trajectory of results ’ signalled the end for @entity40 , who will be relishing the opportunity to do the double over his old club when @entity0 visit @entity44 on wednesday night			2
based on the fate of his predecessors , @entity47 should be a worried man			0
@entity0 ’s record after 24 games is almost identical to the post-title slump in 2012 - 13 when they trailed @entity54 by seven points at the same stage			1
@entity57 finished that season empty - handed and paid for it with his job			0
there is no suggestion that @entity47 is under threat just yet , and the @entity63 has already pulled a rabbit out of the hat in the @entity5 once this season			0
@entity0 's @entity67 looks dejected as @entity17 pull off a shock at the @entity69 @entity67 and @entity70 have words following the final whistle at the @entity69 the way things are shaping up , @entity0 ’s two encounters with @entity74 could have a decisive impact on @entity47 ’s future			1
after snatching a late point against struggling @entity17 , @entity70 is not alone in believing that @entity0 are running out of time to put things right			1
‘ we have to wake up and do the job now before it ’s too late , ’ said @entity70			2
‘ @entity7 , with no disrespect , are not @entity86 who can drop points			2
‘ we have to catch them as soon as possible if we want to be champions			0
but at the same time we have to look behind us			0
@entity12 have won , @entity54 are getting close			0
manager @entity47 accepted his team were lacking in ideas during their game against @entity17 ‘ it will be tough at @entity44			2
it ’s not ideal on a wednesday night during the winter , but we have to win it			0
’ city will not be able to call on @entity98 or new £ 28million striker @entity99 at the @entity100 , with the two @entity102 internationals not expected back from @entity103 until tuesday after playing in the @entity105 final on sunday night			0
on saturday , @entity22 scored with a 92nd - minute free - kick to deny @entity17 after @entity16 had given the relegation strugglers a deserved , if scrappy , lead			1
talks over a new contract for @entity22 remain deadlocked but @entity47 says he is confident the @entity112 midfielder can be persuaded to stay beyond this season .			2

@entity0 needed a last - gasp equaliser to draw with @entity17
@entity22 struck at the death to earn the champions a point
@entity7 are now seven points clear at the top of the @entity9
city have failed to win in their last five games in all *competitions*
@entity70 admits it 's do or die now for @entity0 if they want to *retain* their @entity9 crown
