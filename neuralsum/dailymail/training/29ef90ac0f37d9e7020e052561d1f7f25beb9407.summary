by @entity0 published : 14:29 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 16:04 est , 15 january 2014 art may be food for the soul , but these works really are good enough to eat			1
two amateur photographers have made more than 100 miniature scenes in their living rooms - with food from their kitchen cupboards			1
the ' food art ' includes a moon landing in parmesan cheese , a ski slope on an iced cake , an office built from wafer biscuits and a crib containing the baby @entity19 inside a muffin			0
one small step for parmesan : @entity25 ' food artists ' @entity23 and @entity26 have created more than 130 photos of a miniature world using everyday objects - often from their kitchens off - piste : in one creation these cross-country skiers appear to have got lost on the icing on a cake dancing on iced martini : figure skaters take to the surface of a frozen cocktail in another shot by the artists earning a crust : office workers are hemmed in by wafer biscuits , but at least they can eat their way out on their coffee break : construction workers hauling buckets of beans - including with a miniature @entity50 the artists from @entity52 , @entity25 , used tiny model people which they bought from hobby shops and from @entity56 for as little as £ 1			1
@entity23 and @entity26 began their @entity57 in 2012 and have since amassed more than 130 images , expanding their repertoire to household objects like vinyl records , glass bottles and a fish tank			1
each shot takes up to two hours to piece together using ordinary household objects , coloured paper and a tripod - mounted camera with a macro lens			2
the pair have sold their creations to cafes , restaurants and offices , where they are now on display across @entity25			0
mr @entity23 , 54 , said : ' the construction is very fun , finding the items and building the sets			0
big appetite ? this baker carries a croissant bigger than him			0
the artist pair use 1/67 scale models no crib for his bread : the baby jesus finds an unusual scene for a manger inside a hollowed - out panettone rising to the challenge : builders create a bread house out of dough ( bottom left ) in a tiny cement mixer ice cream sunday : subathers lounge around on their day off with more food than they can eat sawing chocolate : this logging depot made out of thin wafers takes the biscuit in one photo by the artists watermelon men : there was no seed of doubt for the swimmers in this miniature beach scene golden sun : the artists created a perfect sunbathing spot for their figurines with half a pineapple spill something ? a man drinks wine next to a full - size bottle in this photo by the two @entity25 artists dried fruit : brightly - coloured clothes on a miniature washing line are outshone by slices of pear and lime ' we get inspiration from everywhere : the kitchen , food			1
it can strike at any time			2
' despite the intricate nature of their shots , the pair use some surprisingly low - key methods to create them			2
they tend to set up their ' studio ' on the carpets of their living rooms during their free time			1
for the people in their scenes they favour 1/87 scale figurines , which they buy from hobby shops or on @entity56 for as little as £ 1 each			1
mr @entity23 said : ' the reaction is highly variable			0
it is often the surprise and amazement of seeing certain combinations that get people going			0
it 's an attempt to revive what is not alive			0
' our song : some of the photos do not include food , such as this one of a couple dancing on a vinyl record tuning up : the musical theme continues as tweaking these guitar strings becomes an industrial task you 're going to need a bigger boat : this fisherman comes face - to - face with his gigantic catch @entity172 : a rowboat delivers a message in a bottle in this photo , taken at an unusual angle white wedding : as the bride throws her bouquet , guests clamour to catch it without falling off their tiny pebbles daredevil : a cyclist takes on a full - size companion as he makes his way round the rim of a bicycle wheel wall of death : an empty tin can becomes a funfair stunt in this photo , created in the artists ' living rooms in this photo , women and children are dwarfed by their own clothes pegs as they try to reach for the washing the pair are continuing with their project , even releasing ' how - to ' images giving a glimpse of how their pieced their shots together			1
the fantastical scenes include workers sawing apart ' logs ' made of wafer biscuits and a woodland scene with closed cup mushrooms transforming into trees			2
some are a little more bizarre , with a tiny clothes line next to a line of dripping fruit slices			0
and many of the pair 's characters are stranded on top of fruit slices , frozen drinks or biscuit mountains with no sight of terra firma			0
but at least if they get stuck there 's a solution : they can always eat their way out			0
so it was a hoax ! ' making - of ' photos released by the pair show how they created the moon landing made of parmesan cheese , left , and the logging depot constructed from wafer biscuits , right - in their living rooms some of the scenes took hours to set up on the artists ' floors ... as well as needing some very steady hands in this autumn scene , lowly mushrooms became towering oaks surrounded by crisp red leaves complex : the scenes needed a macro lens , but otherwise used household objects and a perfectionist mind			1

amazing works are by @entity255 and @entity26
they have made more than 130 photos from bread , pineapples and coffee
@entity263 : ' we usually create them in our living rooms during our free time '
their *secret* is £ 1 figurines on @entity56 , a good camera and very steady hands
