' ‘ for a while it was between @entity5 and @entity21 ’s dad ’s name , but now it looks like @entity21 will be the middle name			2
’ indeed , at @entity2 ’s baby shower last month , guests brought baby gifts emblazoned with the name @entity5 on them			1
including gifts embroidered with the initials @entity33			1
after the party the flowers were given to the nearby @entity62 in @entity63			2
@entity1 and @entity2 , 36 , are currently on vacation aboard the @entity66 yacht in @entity67 barts.but it will definitely be all hands on deck when the couple return to @entity72 ahead of their baby ’s birth at one of the city ’s most exclusive hospitals on february 28			1

the @entity7 judge said he would like to adopt the same parenting style with which he was raised			0
happy : the duo looked the picture of domestic bliss as they strolled hand - in - hand on the beach baby on board : @entity2 , who is due in february , showed off her baby bump as she soaked up the sun with her lover pecs appeal : @entity5 's pectoral muscles were on display as he strolled on the beach shirtless ' be cool about it , and do n’t worry about things to much … the way my brother and i were brought up , it was kind of relaxed			1

' @entity1 went on to say that he was looking forward to having his son follow in his footsteps , and would like to teach him how to run the business			0
as fatherhood draws near , the star knows he 'll at least be great at handing out advice			0
' i ’m not brilliant with babies , ' he told parade			0
' i never know what to do			0

' @entity2 already has a seven - year - old son @entity11 with her ex-husband , millionaire property developer @entity139			1
she was said to be keen to have the baby in @entity10 so she is near to @entity11			1
but the couple will be on the go as they will likely take the tot – who will have dual nationality – back to the @entity148 to @entity1 ’s @entity150 mansion soon after his birth as @entity1 will start filming tv hit @entity148 ’s @entity153 and will be based in the @entity148 for weeks			0
close enough ? @entity2 patted her man 's chest protectively as they walked down the beach such bliss : the pair took a romantic stroll and walked arm - in - arm what 's the gossip ? something was making the pair chuckle as they enjoyed their time together holding on tight : @entity2 kept a firm grip on her man as she enjoyed a walk on the sand and the pair practiced for parenthood as they strolled the beaches of @entity38 last month and @entity1 looked comfortable as he held tight to a little blonde child , smiling as he bonded with the baby			1
dressed in a strapless black bathing suit with a black sarong , @entity2 - who seemed thrilled her boyfriend was so into the tot - showed pregnancy is n’t affecting her style			1
the besotted couple held hands and linked arms on their stroll as they enjoyed a relaxing @entity190 vacation			0
and it 's all change for @entity1 , who recently revealed he will be giving up his cigarettes and not smoke in front of his son , after he was criticised for puffing away near his pregnant girlfriend			2
