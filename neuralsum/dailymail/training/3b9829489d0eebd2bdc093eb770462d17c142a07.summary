forensic examinations of the recovered body showed that sections of flesh had been carefully sliced away while joints had been butchered			0
the court heard how they carried his body with them as they sought to escape their frozen hell			0

now we know that @entity77 died somewhere else and they dragged the body all the way through the snow , eating it step by step			0
