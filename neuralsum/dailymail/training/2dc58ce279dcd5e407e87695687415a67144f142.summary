by @entity0 published : 04:20 est , 15 may 2013 updated : 04:20 est , 15 may 2013 women live longer than men partly because their immune systems age more slowly women live longer than men partly because their immune systems age more slowly , a new study has revealed			1
as their body defences weaken with the passing years , the increasing susceptibility of men to disease shortens their lives , it is claimed			1
life expectancy in the @entity15 is 79 years for men and 82 for women , according to the @entity18			1
in @entity20 , where the research took place , the gap is wider			0
there , the average lifespan of men is the same as in the @entity15 , but women live to 85.5			1
the study involved examining blood samples from healthy volunteers with a wide range of ages			0
scientists tested the blood of 356 men and women aged between 20 and 90 and looked at levels of white blood cells and immune system signalling molecules called cytokines			1
in both sexes , the number of white blood cells per person decreased with age , but closer study revealed striking differences between men and women			1
the rate of decline of most t - cell and b - cell lymphocytes , two key elements of the immune system , was faster in men			1
similarly , men showed a more rapid age - related decline in the two cytokines , @entity60 - 6 and @entity61			0
two specific types of immune system cell that actively destroy foreign invaders , @entity65 t - cells and natural killer ( @entity63 ) cells , increased in number with age			1
in this case , the rate of increase was higher in women than in men			2
@entity63 cells are believed to be one of the body 's first lines of defence against cancer			0
the research , led by professor @entity82 , from @entity83 , appears in the online journal @entity85			0
the scientists wrote : ‘ age - related changes in various immunological parameters differ between men and women			0
our findings indicate that the slower rate of decline in these immunological parameters in women than in men is consistent with the fact that women live longer than do men			2
’ immune system mechanisms not only protect the body from infection and cancer , but can cause disease when not properly regulated			2
in both sexes , the number of white blood cells per person decreased with age but the rate of decrease was quicker in men inflammation is a potentially damaging immune system response that contributes to heart and artery disease and could play a role in dementia			1
the cytokine @entity61 is an important regulator of inflammation , helping to put the brakes on the immune system to keep it under control			2
its faster decline in men suggests that as men age they might more rapidly be affected by inflammatory conditions			0
professor @entity82 said : ‘ the process of ageing is different for men and women for many reasons			0
women have more oestrogen than men which seems to protect them from cardiovascular disease until menopause			0
sex hormones also affect the immune system , especially certain types of lymphocytes			2
‘ because people age at different rates , a person 's immunological parameters could be used to provide an indication of their true biological age			0

men are more susceptible to diseases that shorten their lives because their defences weaken quicker
men and women both lose white blood cells as they age but the rate of decline is **greater** in men
both *develop* more immune system cells as the age but the rate of increase is **greater** in women
@entity15 life expectancy for men is 79 and for women it 's 82
