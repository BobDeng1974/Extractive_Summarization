a former @entity1 soldier who belonged to an undercover unit in @entity3 has claimed he and his colleagues resorted to ‘ murder and mayhem ’ during a secret campaign against the @entity8			1
@entity9 was a member of a 30 - man team which would ‘ shoot first and ask questions later ’			2
they shot at least 20 terrorist suspects and breached the @entity15 ’s rules of war			2
in support of his allegations , he has provided @entity20 with detailed descriptions of some of the most controversial killings in @entity3 ’s recent history			2
a former @entity1 soldier claims he was part of an undercover unit which carried out a secret campaign against the @entity8			1
pictured is a soldier in @entity31 during @entity32 @entity9 says these shootings were carried out by the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) , a clandestine @entity15 team sent into @entity36 neighbourhoods to eliminate @entity8 gunmen			1
his accounts are being studied by detectives from the @entity41 ’s @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , which was set up to re-examine suspicious deaths over the course of ‘ @entity32 ’			1
more than 2,260 cases are on its books			2
@entity48 ’s devastating disclosures include the claim that he never once cautioned a terror suspect or fired a warning shot before himself engaging with lethal force			2
he said he and his colleagues shot at least 20 men , though he could not say how many died			2
the revelations come a week after a damning report into the 1989 death of pro-republican lawyer @entity60 that revealed shocking levels of collusion between @entity1 agents and @entity65 paramilitaries			1
in an interview with @entity20 , @entity9 defended the @entity34 ’s tactics , insisting they were necessary given the dangers he and others faced			1
even so , his recollections , revealed here for the first time , are likely to increase calls for a public inquiry into the actions of @entity76 in @entity3			2
he said : ‘ we were mostly working alone or in pairs on the dim streets of @entity31			2
if i had given a warning i would have been as good as dead myself			2
the @entity34 was a counter-terrorist unit			1
how do you counter the terrorists ? by terrorising them			2
the revelations come a week after a report into the death of pro-republican lawyer @entity60 in 1989 ‘ i have nothing to hide and no element of the @entity34 ’s activities troubled me from a moral perspective			1
i ’m aware the @entity40 is looking into some of these incidents			1
but challenging them [ the terrorists ] was a luxury they were simply not entitled to			2
’ @entity9 returns to the subject in a draft of new book based on his experiences			2
he writes : ‘ if the @entity8 believed they could get away with murder and mayhem , it was the @entity34 ’s job to make them see how they liked a taste of their own medicine			1
’ @entity9 told @entity20 how the @entity34 operated			1
he said : ‘ at night we would patrol the streets looking for our special bad boys – they were wanted for terrorist activities or murder			2
' we simply dealt with them , very severely , and then dropped them off at the roadside for the uniformed forces to pick up later			2
we never discussed these few incidents outside our sections and we never asked what other @entity34 sections were up to			1
‘ what does “ dealt with ” mean ? what do you think it means ? i am not going to tell you , so do n’t even ask			0
but occasionally people turned up with broken arms and broken legs			0
’ one of the cases @entity9 will discuss is the killing of @entity127			0
on may 12 , 1972 , a two - vehicle @entity34 patrol approached a roadblock set up illegally by residents in @entity31 ’s @entity132 area			1
@entity9 was monitoring the @entity34 ’s radio frequency when he heard voices and the crackle of gunfire – his colleagues were engaging the roadblock it with a sub-machine gun from an unmarked car			1
@entity127 was shot dead and four others were wounded			0
a coroner later heard that none of those men had fired weapons at @entity34 personnel			1
@entity9 said : ‘ i do n’t know for sure if @entity148 and the others were armed but i would n’t be surprised if they were n’t			0
at the time they were manning a barricade because they wanted to control movement in their area			0
occasionally we had these incidents when people on barricades – which were illegal in the first place – were shot at			0
bullet holes marked on a @entity161 belonging to the @entity34 after an @entity8 shootout ‘ but we ’re talking about a ghetto of @entity31 at two or three o’clock in the morning			1
people on the street said , “ oh , they were innocent , ” but this was a very hostile environment , like @entity168 or @entity169			0
‘ i do n’t know if there will be an outcry now , i am just giving my assessment based on close contact information			0
i was only listening on the radio that night so i do n’t think they [ the @entity40 detectives ] can do me for that			1
’ his account also includes incidents when he and his colleagues visited notorious @entity8 pubs in the @entity181 and @entity182 areas of @entity31			1
on both occasions , he says members of @entity8 active service units were eliminated			1
@entity9 said @entity34 soldiers adjusted their ‘ standard operating procedures ’ based on their experiences in @entity36 neighbourhoods , and in variance to the @entity191 that @entity15 personnel were supposed to follow			1
' i would say that we operated on the edge of the law , and only because we had to , because the situations we found ourselves in required us to act quickly and lethally ' he said : ‘ the @entity191 in @entity3 were very clear : you were only allowed to open fire at a person actively shooting at you or someone you are with			0
also , you could open fire at someone aiming a weapon but who had n’t fired yet			0
we had our own slight variation on these rules			0
we opened fire at any small group in hard areas , neighbourhoods that even looked suspicious , armed or not – it did n’t matter			0
we targeted specific groups that were always up to no good			0
these types were sympathisers and supporters , assisting the @entity8 movement			1
‘ as far as we were concerned they were guilty by association and party to terrorist activities , leaving themselves wide open to the ultimate punishment from us			0
if someone was picked up and it was discovered that they were illegally armed , or that they were on our “ special ” wanted list of @entity8 killers , they could be dealt with right there in the countryside : neutralised			1
‘ that said , i do n’t believe we ever targeted innocent civilians			0
i would say that we operated on the edge of the law , and only because we had to , because the situations we found ourselves in required us to act quickly and lethally			0
we were hunting down hardcore terrorists			0
’ @entity9 left the @entity34 in 1974 , the same year the unit was disbanded and replaced by the larger @entity240 , also called ‘ @entity241 ’			1
a masked member of the @entity8 , which @entity48 claims was targeted by the undercover unit according to military sources , the @entity34 had been at a disadvantage because only as many as nine soldiers could deploy at any one time , with nine more on standby and the others resting			1
the sections were commanded by sergeants or sergeant - majors who had previously served in elite units such as the @entity253 , @entity254 , the @entity255 and the @entity256			0
the @entity34 was based at @entity31 ’s @entity257			1
@entity9 , now in his early 60s , spent four years back with his parent regiment before leaving the @entity15			0
he says that in spite of the unit ’s tactics being adopted by @entity240 and the @entity253 , the @entity34 has been denied the public recognition it deserves			1
‘ what about the @entity253 team that went into the @entity266 , or the @entity253 team that took out the terrorists in @entity269 ? they were only doing what we were doing ten to 15 years earlier , ’ he said			0
@entity9 uses a pseudonym for security			0
his real identity is known to @entity20 and he provided this newspaper with his military identification number and a service history			0
the @entity278 has attacked his plans to publish a book next year			0
after reading the draft of @entity283 , civil servants called for changes , including removal of the ‘ mayhem and murder ’ reference			0
@entity9 has agreed to do so but maintains the @entity34 operated on the edge of the law			1
the @entity278 report read : ‘ to suggest lethal purpose [ on the part of the @entity34 ] implies a criminal intent			1
for operational security reasons we do not confirm the role and function of special duties units			0
the @entity34 was bound by @entity191 , the same as other units			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity41 said it did not comment on individual cases			0
the @entity278 said : ‘ armed forces have always served in @entity3 in accordance with the strict rules of engagement and subject to @entity1 and international humanitarian law			1
‘ soldiers were fully aware of the rules governing the use of force and these were reiterated in training and before operations			0
specific instruction was given on the circumstances in which it was permitted to open fire			0
we will continue to co-operate with any investigations initiated by the @entity40			2
’ @entity127 was killed on may 12 , 1972			0
he was said to belong to the @entity320 , whose members claimed not to take part in terrorist activities			0
but according to intelligence , @entity320 members were actively supporting the @entity8			2
the @entity320 had set up illegal barricades on the outskirts of @entity320 areas in @entity31 and were checking everyone who approached			0
an @entity34 convoy approached and an @entity34 soldier fired a @entity334 sub-machine gun , killing @entity127 , 44 , and wounding four others			1
at an inquest , an @entity34 soldier said the convoy had been engaged and had returned fire			1
civilian eyewitnesses suggested that @entity127 and the other @entity320 members had been unarmed			0
though @entity9 and other @entity34 soldiers were questioned by police over the @entity127 shooting , none has ever been prosecuted .			2
