the @entity2 cherry picks sections of the @entity4 and misinterprets the accounts of the @entity6 in order to wage jihad and sign up new recruits , experts say			1
it is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in @entity13 and @entity14 , where @entity15 has proclaimed what it calls a ' caliphate ' , ruled by its often brutal version of @entity20 law			1
the group purport to recreate the conquests and rule of the @entity6 and his successors and maintains its worst brutalities - such as beheading captives - only prove its purity in following what it contends is the prophet 's example			1
an @entity15 member parades through the streets of @entity33 in @entity14 waving an @entity2 flag and brandishing a gun			1
experts have now said that @entity15 misinterprets the @entity4 in order to wage jihad but now @entity40 clerics and other experts are speaking out , saying that the group hand picks what it wants from @entity45 's holy book , the @entity4 , and from accounts of @entity6 's actions and sayings , known as the @entity49			1
it then misinterprets many of these , while ignoring everything in the texts that contradicts those hand - picked selections			0
writings by the group 's clerics and its @entity59 online magazine , @entity58 , are full of citations from @entity4 verses , the @entity49 and centuries of interpreters , mostly from hardliners			1
but @entity65 , an assistant professor of @entity67 at @entity68 in the @entity69 , says these are taken far out of context by @entity15			2
he explained that @entity20 scholars throughout history have used texts in a ' decontextualised way ' to suit their purposes and says that @entity15 represent the extreme			1
he added : ' it would be a mistake to conclude the @entity57 's extremism is the true islam that emerges from the @entity4 and @entity49			2
@entity20 clerics say @entity15 just hand picks certain parts of the @entity4 to boost their cause while ignoring other parts that contradict their selections meanwhile @entity87 , an islamic law scholar at the @entity89 , says despite its claims to the contrary , @entity15 is a largely political group , borne out of the conflicts of @entity14 and @entity13			1
he said : ' the group is trying to make @entity95 a co-conspirator in a genocidal project			0
' @entity97 , an assistant professor at the @entity98 at @entity99 in @entity100 , agreed			0
he added that the phenomenon of reading religious sources out of context has existed throughout the ages			0
he explained : ' we should not grant any legitimacy to those who violate @entity45 , then hijack it and speak on its behalf			0
' this is not @entity20 terror , this is terror committed by @entity40			2
' @entity20 clerics also say that while misreading some texts , @entity15 also ignore certain @entity4 verses which promote mercy , preservation of life and protection of innocents , all of which are binding under @entity20 shariah law			1
it is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in @entity13 and @entity14 , where @entity15 has proclaimed what it calls a ' caliphate ' many mainstream clerics compare the group to the @entity128 , an early sect that was so notorious for ' takfir , ' or declaring other @entity40 heretics for even simple sins , that it was rejected by the faith			1
part of the problem in countering the group 's ideology is that moderate clerics have struggled to come up with a cohesive , modern interpretation , especially of the @entity4 verses connected to @entity6 's wars with his enemies			1
militants often point to the @entity4 's ninth sura , or chapter , which includes calls for @entity40 to ' fight polytheists wherever you find them ' and to subdue @entity149 and @entity150 until they pay a tax			2
@entity152 clerics counter that these verses are linked to specifics of the time and note other verses that say there is ' no force in religion			0
' and while moderate clerics disagree with the @entity57 's interpretation point - by - point , at times they accept the same ideals			0
@entity164 , the grand imam of @entity166 's @entity165 , one of @entity45 's most prestigious seats of learning , denounced the burning of the @entity171 pilot as a violation of @entity45			0
but then he called for the perpetrators to be subjected to the same punishment that @entity15 prescribes for those who ' wage war on @entity45 ' - crucifixion , death or the amputation of hands and legs			2
there are citations in the @entity183 of ordering beheadings , and verses in the @entity4 setting out rules for dealing with slaves			2
most @entity40 denounced the burning of a @entity171 pilot as a violation of @entity45 with some calling for the perpetrators to be subjected to the same punishment pivoting off these , @entity15 contends that anyone who rejects beheadings or enslavement is not a real @entity20 and has been corrupted by modern @entity196 ideas			1
one @entity15 cleric , @entity197 , wrote a vehement defence of beheadings after the killing of @entity201 journalist @entity200			0
he wrote : ' those who pervert @entity45 are not those who cut off the heads of disbelievers and terrorise them but those who want ( @entity45 ) to be like @entity207 or @entity208 , with no killing , no fighting , no blood or striking necks			0
' @entity45 is the religion of battle , of cutting heads , of shedding blood			0
' to support beheadings , the group cites the @entity4 as calling on @entity40 to ' strike the necks ' of their enemies			2
but other clerics counter the verse means @entity20 fighters should swiftly kill enemies in the heat of battle , and is not a call to execute captives			0
sheikh @entity229 , a cleric in the ultraconservative @entity231 movement said : ' it appears the @entity2 have adopted violent ideas first , then searched books of religious interpretation to find a cover for their actions			0

@entity15 purport to recreate conquests and rule of the @entity6
but experts say @entity15 just cherry pick sections of the @entity4 for its cause
add they misinterpret @entity20 texts and ignore others that contradict them
@entity253 that @entity15 are political despite claims they are a religious group
so far an estimated 20,000 people have joined the group in their territory
isis run a ' caliphate ' under brutal *conditions* in parts of @entity13 and @entity14
