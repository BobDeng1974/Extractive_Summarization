by @entity0 published : 11:48 est , 1 october 2012 updated : 12:41 est , 1 october 2012 military chiefs have been accused of dishonoring the war dead over plans to put 60,000 solar panels on the famous runway at @entity7 's @entity6			1
the @entity8 wants to erect a 7ft tall fence on the site and turn it into what critics claim will be a ' monstrosity ' in a bid to make itself more green			2
it has chosen the site because it claims the airfield is not in use - even though the memory of events still lingers on			0
outrage : the @entity8 plans to install 60,000 blue solar panels on the runway at @entity7 's @entity6			1
critics say the panels ( pictured in a mockup for the project ) will make it look like the runway 's made of @entity28 never forget : airmen at the @entity30 watch smoke billow from the @entity32 which had just been blown up by @entity34 bombers during the attack on @entity7 on dec. 7 , 1941 the runway at @entity6 was where the @entity37 military tried to launch planes to try and counter attack during the @entity7 raid on december 7 , 1941			1
some 33 of the 70 craft stationed there were destroyed as @entity34 aircraft slaughtered 2,402 @entity37 and wounded 1,282 during the surprise offensive			2
in 1964 the runway was designated a @entity47 and its iconic red and white control tower has featured in films such as ‘ @entity7 ’			2
now , however , the @entity8 wants to disregard all that and turn it into a solar farm			0
going green : solar panels ( like those at the @entity57 facility in @entity58 , @entity59 ) will help the @entity8 reach its goal to get 50 per cent of its energy from renewables by 2020 @entity63 , director of the @entity64 on @entity6 , called for other sites to be considered			1
he said : ' we totally agree with ( the @entity8 ) being green , but we do n't think they should do it where @entity37 spilled their red blood			1
' there 's plenty of room for them to create this project off to the west , which is just scrub oak and abandoned land			0
' he added that even though the site has not been maintained since 1999 , it was still used by the local community			0
he said : ' this is an area that the kids play in , and they 're going to cover it up and put a 7 - foot high fence around it and basically make the place a monstrosity '			0
in memoriam : the @entity89 that remembers those who lost their lives on december 7 , 1941 during the @entity34 bombing of @entity7 in remembrance : 2,402 @entity37 died in the @entity7 attacks by the @entity34 on december 7 , 1941			1
@entity95 , 83 , of @entity96 , a @entity7 survivor , remembers the dead at an event in 2004 under the @entity8 's plan 60,000 of the blue solar panels , which are 4ft by 6ft in size , would be arranged so that they still looked like the runway does now			1
there would also be a white cross every 1,000ft along the 4,000ft runway to create the effect			0
some 14 acres of land adjoining the runway would be developed as part of the $ 500 million project as the @entity8 seeks to get 50 per cent of its energy from renewables by 2020			1
museum spokeswoman @entity116 said that the new design was awful and claimed ' it 's going to look like the runway 's made of @entity28 '			0
but according to the @entity8 , the runway is actually an ' inactive space that is ideally located and sized ' for a solar farm			2
spokeswoman @entity122 told @entity123 that the @entity8 ' remains committed to balancing our responsibility towards environmental stewardship , energy security and the preservation of historically significant facilities and structures			0
