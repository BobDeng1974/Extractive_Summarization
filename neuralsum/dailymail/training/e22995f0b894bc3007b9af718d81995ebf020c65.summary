losing your phone or keys is one thing , but losing your glasses - especially if you need them to be able to see what you ’re looking for in the first place - can be stressful			2
to solve this problem , an @entity9 design team has created a clip that attaches to the arm of any pair of glasses or sunglasses , and will beep when they are lost			1
it syncs with a smartphone via @entity18 , or if wearers do n’t have a smart device , they can choose to pair it with a keychain remote			1
it attaches to any standard arm on glasses ( pictured ) or sunglasses , and the clip connects via @entity18 to a smartphone app or keychain the clip is the brainchild of @entity9 - based @entity25 , who has set up an @entity36 campaign to raise $ 50,000 ( £ 30,600 ) to fund production of the device			1
the clip weighs less than 20g , has a range of 50ft ( 15 metres )			1
look is small enough to clip onto the inside of the arm , without touching the wearer 's face , and is just 0.4 - inches ( 10mm ) wide , 1.5 - inches ( 40mm ) long and 0.2 - inches ( 6mm ) thick			1
the clip attaches to glasses using adhesive			2
this means it can be removed easily , or placed on any other item that needs to be tracked			0
it is powered by two lightweight 399 batteries , and comes in black , red , silver and white , and brown			0
if the project is funded , the clip will cost $ 28 ( £ 17 ) and the free app will be available on @entity60 and @entity61			2
it weighs less than 20g , has a range of 50ft ( 15 metres ) , and ms @entity25 claims , wearers will not feel any difference in the weight of their glasses when the clip is attached			1
' the idea for @entity70 came about when i could n’t find my own reading glasses ' , said ms @entity25			1
' after all the time i spent and the long , frustrating experience of searching , i thought that if i had something to help me find my glasses , i could have avoided all the pressure and loss of time i experienced			0
' when i did n’t find a product like this on the market , i decided to do it myself			0
