@entity1 ’s on - off grudge match with @entity2 will be rescheduled for this autumn even though the giant @entity4 ’s initial reaction to saturday ’s chaotic postponement was to wash his fists of the @entity8 rival he has defeated once already			1
@entity1 ’s frustration with @entity2 ’s breaking of his left hand was understandable after @entity13 ’s twin - set of injury withdrawals had stalled his career for so long			1
but then fury himself pulled out of saturday ’s rearranged clash with late replacement @entity18 when his uncle @entity20 , his first trainer at the start of his career , fell suddenly and critically ill as an arterial blood - clot formed after a minor operation			1
face off : @entity2 ( left ) and @entity1 square up to one another ahead of their fight that was cancelled and a contract is a contract , after all			1
promoter @entity27 is meeting with the fight family fury this week to review potential dates			2
by then @entity2 will have received specialist advice as to how soon he can resume sparring , hopefully with a view to fighting before the end of october			1
@entity27 says : ‘ what has happened to @entity1 ’s uncle is terribly unfortunate but we have an agreement to get the fight back on as soon as he and @entity2 are available			1
and it will still be the final eliminator for a world heavyweight title challenge to @entity42			0
’ @entity1 says some silly things at times and his belief that obscene tirades sell fights is mistaken but his devotion to the family ethos of the travelling community to which he belongs is genuine beyond question			1
although he knew he would be an easy target for the twitter trolls if he pulled out of a fight after being so critical of @entity13 and @entity2 for doing the same to him , @entity1 ’s emotional concern for his uncle was paramount			1
replacement : @entity1 ( left ) pulled out of his fight because he was ' really affected ' by his uncle 's illness no laughing matter : @entity1 ( left ) pulled out of his fight @entity18 ( right ) due to his uncle 's illness no go : @entity1 ( left ) and @entity18 's fight is off after @entity1 's uncle was taken ill beneath the lurid public persona lives an engaging 25 - year - old lad who is so likeable that his outbursts always come as a surprise to those who have spent time in his company away from the spotlight			1
in private , his fierce ambition to become world heavyweight champion is informed by an intelligent thought process which would confound those who despair of his penchant for play - acting as the wild man			0
that is part of the dilemma for the @entity85 as they prepare to rebuke him for the most vulgar and offensive of his recent outbursts , for which he has apologised			0
nor would it be prudent to press ahead with a disciplinary hearing while his uncle remains in a coma in hospital			0
@entity1 has expressed resentment at being summoned to explain himself and threatens to switch his fights from @entity95 to @entity96 , from where this @entity98 family originally hails			1
behind the scenes : snap from @entity1 during a training session at his gym in @entity103 persona : fury is a different man away from the camera then the portrayal of him in public but after only one bout in 15 months – an inconsequential one at that – and with another delay now upon him , @entity1 does have to be careful how he and his other uncle , @entity112 who is now his trainer , manage his career at this point			1
@entity1 ’s core following comes from in and around @entity116 and the big tv pay - nights are to be had in this country			2
also , @entity119 is a stronger base from which to launch both a world title challenge and an assault on the @entity124 boxing market			0
@entity1 is racing @entity126 ’s @entity125 for the honour of becoming the first boxer of gypsy stock to win a world championship			2
@entity125 won the @entity132 middleweight belt on the @entity1 - deprived bill in @entity116 by stopping @entity135 ’s @entity134 and hopes to meet @entity136 in a world title eliminator @entity137 sooner @entity1 can get @entity2 back in the ring , the better			1
@entity140 legend @entity139 believes his protegee @entity142 can become his country ’s first world heavyweight champion			0
@entity139 , a three - division world title holder in his own right , bases that prediction on his first - hand experience of the comparative punching power between @entity151 and world champion heavyweight phenomenon @entity1			1
strong man : @entity142 is a powerful puncher , according to his trainer @entity155 now @entity151 ’s trainer , @entity139 also worked the pads and the corner for @entity159 during some of his days as the most feared fighter on the planet			0
@entity139 says : ‘ holding the pads for @entity142 hurts me more than @entity1 did			2
two of the present world heavyweight belt holders will be vulnerable to @entity142 , who is really heavy - handed			0
it will be tremendous for @entity140 boxing if he can make heavyweight history			0
’ the @entity95 boxing public will have a chance to evaluate that claim on friday night under @entity172 ’s promotional banner			0
@entity151 is one of three @entity140 in the stable of the @entity174 , who fancies the chances of his man from @entity178 against either @entity1 or @entity2			1
hard hitting : @entity151 's punching power is comparable to that of a young @entity1 @entity151 is taking on @entity182 @entity181 in @entity183 for minor @entity184 and @entity185 would lift him higher up the queue to challenge @entity184 heavyweight champion @entity187 or @entity185 ‘ regular ’ title holder @entity188 , both of whom @entity139 is convinced he could beat			1
@entity151 is the chief supporting attraction on the @entity183 undercard for @entity194 ’s @entity132 welterweight title fight with the tough @entity195			0
@entity196 and @entity197 will be televised live friday night on @entity198 some are calling him the @entity200 and he does bear quite a resemblance to @entity202 , our late 1956 olympic gold medallist and former @entity95 featherweight champion			2
others are talking of him as the middleweight @entity1 and 27 knock - outs in an undefeated 30 - fight record strengthen that comparison			1
@entity209 is blazing a trail of destruction through his classic division , as his latest victim willingly testifies			1
right hook : @entity209 punches @entity215 during the @entity185 / @entity217 middleweight championship winner : @entity209 celebrates after knocking @entity215 out at @entity219 smiles : and he celebrates with his belts after the bout on saturday night @entity215 , himself a recent world champion , was blown away inside three rounds of their title fight in @entity229 ’s @entity219 this saturday night and promptly said : ‘ i ’ve never seen , let alone been hit by , a harder puncher in my life			1
the first time he lands on you comes as a shock			0
’ thus @entity215 tacitly confirmed all the scary stories emanating from gyms in @entity124 of how @entity209 , despite using gloves like pillows , is flattening sparring partners almost twice his size and wearing head - guards			2
one report claims that in order to get some kind of sparring , the man from @entity245 often has to promise not to punch his opponents in the head			0
so he drops them with disembowelling body - shots , like the one which took out @entity256 challenger @entity255 around this time last year			0
@entity209 , at 32 , is coming to prominence late			2
first there was a 350 - fight world - title - winning amateur career in which he lost only five times			0
then the pros kept ducking him			0
like @entity159 ( and @entity202 ) : @entity209 has been compared with boxing legends @entity1 ( left ) and @entity202 challenger : he could be set for a fight with @entity269 of @entity270 but now the big money is getting behind him and the @entity124 television moguls are pressing @entity269 to meet @entity209 in a battle to unify their various world 160 lb titles			1
the huge @entity270 support for @entity269 in @entity229 and the frenzy growing around @entity209 would make for a mega-night in the mecca of the @entity219			2
the middleweight @entity159 ? @entity209 has not only the punch but the chin to suggest he may well be			1
a split - second before he was knocked out @entity215 connected with his best punch of those three rounds , a peach of a right cross flush to the @entity245 jaw			0
@entity209 , without so much as a flinch , instantly delivered his concussive left - right combination			2
then he grinned , as all the ring ’s baby - faced assassins have tended to do down the decades as they help their fallen prey to their feet			0
rather like an innocent kid			0
not unlike how we remember @entity202			2
but then he has a lot to smile about			0
like it being six years and 17 fights since he was taken the distance .			0
