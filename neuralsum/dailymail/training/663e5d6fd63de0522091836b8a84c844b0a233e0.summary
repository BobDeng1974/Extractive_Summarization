by @entity0 scientists believe they have found an alternative to surgery for women with the so - called ' breast cancer gene '			1
@entity6 had a mastectomy after learning she had the faulty gene when a woman is told she has the so - called ‘ breast cancer gene ’ she currently faces a stark choice – to have her breasts and ovaries removed or face the terrifyingly high risk of cancer			1
but now , researchers in @entity16 believe they have come up with an alternative			0
the scientists say women with the @entity21 gene mutation could use drugs , which are already available , to reduce their risk of the disease			1
in the @entity26 , about one woman in every 1,000 has the @entity21 mutation – the same gene fault that prompted @entity6 to undergo a double mastectomy			2
these women have up to an 85 per cent chance of developing breast cancer and up to a 40 per cent chance of ovarian cancer			1
until now , surgery to remove the breasts and ovaries has been their only option			2
however , researchers at @entity40 , @entity16 , now say drug treatments which lower levels of oestrogen could also reduce cancer risks			0
their research revealed that there is a direct link between high levels of oestrogen and dna damage , which causes cancer , in the breasts and ovaries			2
the scientists also found that the cells of women with the @entity21 mutation can not effectively fight the very high levels of oestrogen that exist in all women ’s breasts and ovaries , leaving them vulnerable to dna damage			1
dr @entity61 , who led the research , said : ‘ this discovery is very significant in the management of women with the @entity21 gene mutation			1
‘ it ’s the first really credible evidence that oestrogen is driving cancer in women with a @entity21 gene mutation			1
‘ because of this discovery , we now have the opportunity to propose an alternative treatment to surgery			0
‘ it also opens up the possibility of pausing treatment for a period in order for women to have children , if desired			0
’ scientists say taking anti-oestrogen drugs could reduce the risk of cell damage , and therefore tumours , in people with the @entity21 gene mutation			1
this is because these women 's cells are unable to cope with high levels of the hormone			0
@entity6 is pictured with partner , @entity90 he added : ‘ what also makes this exciting is that there are drugs already on the market which turn off oestrogen production			0
‘ in theory , we could use these drugs to chemically reduce oestrogen production in women which could negate the need for irreversible surgery			2
’ the researchers are currently seeking funding to launch clinical trials and hope to do so within 12 months			0
it is envisaged that , in the first instance , a small control trial will be carried out using a combination of two drugs on 12 women for a period of three months , using biopsy , blood and urine samples to track dna damage .			0

women with the @entity21 mutation have up to an 85 **%** risk of breast cancer
they also have up to a 40 **%** chance of developing ovarian cancer
currently , the only way they can significantly reduce the risk is surgery
this involves having their breasts and / or ovaries removed
now , scientists have found anti-oestrogen drugs could also reduce the risk
they say cells of women with the gene mutation are damaged by oestrogen
this damage can lead to cancerous tumours developing
