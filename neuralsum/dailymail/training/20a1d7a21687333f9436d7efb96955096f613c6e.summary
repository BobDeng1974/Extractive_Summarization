a mother has been given permission to change the surname of her three - year - old twin sons because of the ' bizarre conduct ' of their father			1
the woman , who can not be named , told a family court judge that her children they needed protecting from their father 's internet blogging ' activities '			1
judge @entity14 said the man , who had not seen the children for a year after separating from his wife , is embroiled in litigation about what contact he should have with them			2
ruling : a mother will be allowed to change the surname of her twins because of the ' bizarre conduct ' of their father on his blog ( posed by model ) he said the man had a ' perception of martyrdom ' and had created a ' protest blog ' which he updated ' virtually daily '			2
judge @entity14 said the man had ' taken to referring ' to his estranged wife as ' a drug - addicted alcoholic who suffered from sexually transmitted diseases '			1
he also said he had posted a medical report relating to one his children , had posted ' extensive details ' of litigation issues and had posted his sons ' names			1
the judge said the man had ' let himself down ' - and said his ' activity ' had been ' severely damaging ' to the welfare of the children			0
and he concluded that allowing the woman to change the children 's names was ' necessary and proportionate '			0
ruling : the @entity52 in @entity53 , which has a family division where statements on rulings of family matters are often read out detail of the case has emerged in a ruling by @entity61 following a hearing in @entity63 , @entity64			0
the judge said the family could not be identified			0
' i am persuaded that the desirable preservation of a symbol of a paternal link through the preservation of the surname has to give way to the protection of the children from the father 's publication steps , ' said @entity61			0
' i can not allow a situation in which the children at an older age and their friends can chance upon web - based insults to the mother ... or anything else that the father decides to publish from time to time in association with their name			1
' it seems i can not realistically stop the father 's activities at source but i can stop the harmful consequences , which are , of course , associated with the identification of this material alongside the names of the children			2
' in this context , in the children 's best interests , it is necessary and proportionate to allow their change of name			0
