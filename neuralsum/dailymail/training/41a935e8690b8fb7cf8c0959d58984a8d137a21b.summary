by @entity0 a breakthrough technology that can create ' virtual babies ' by digitally combining the dna of two people is set to launch			1
these virtual babies can then be screened for genetic diseases , before ruling out sperm donors or partners who could pose a risk to a potential baby ’s health			1
@entity13 , the technology could allow prospective parents to assess genetic risks even before a child is conceived			0
@entity19 - based group , @entity20 , is about to launch a service in the @entity22 capable of digitally combining the dna of two people to create ' virtual babies ' the idea behind the technology came around six years ago when founder @entity20 , from @entity19 , received a terrifying call			1
when her baby was just a few days old , ms @entity20 was asked by a stranger over the phone to check whether the child was still alive			0
‘ can you go check and confirm and come back to the phone ? ’ the voice insisted			2
in shock ms @entity20 did just that			0
when she returned , the caller revealed that her son – conceived using a sperm donor - had tested positive for an inherited disorder called @entity41 , @entity41 ( medium - chain acyl - coa dehydrogenase deficiency ) prevents those affected from converting fats to sugar and it can be fatal if it is not diagnosed early			2
this was the moment that ms @entity20 ’ life changed			2
according to a report in the @entity52 , her shock at not knowing about the sperm donor ’s genetic disorder prompted her to start a company , @entity20			2
@entity13 , the technology could allow prospective parents to assess the risks of genetic disease without having to have a real pregnancy from which to extract the dna the $ 1,995 ( £ 1,200 ) works by first screening the prospective donors or parents for any genetic disorders , which involves sequencing their dna			1
algorithms are then fed this data and use it to digitally recreate the process of genetic recombination – which is the mixing of genetic information between a sperm and an egg			2
this produces up to 10,000 simulated embryos per pairing , which are all sequenced to look for mutations in single genes that can cause 500 rare diseases			0
computer software can then to work out the disease probability in the digital child and the client will get a list of ‘ safe ’ donors from which to choose			1
other companies are already able screen partners for genes that could cause disease if combined with a similar variant			0
but @entity20 ' new @entity13 system is thought to be around 100,000 times more powerful that this technique , known as carrier screening			1

in theory , the technology could be used to screen potential babies for traits other than diseases			1
it would also fall outside rules used to regulate embryo testing and screening			0
the practice has raised some ethical questions about the prospect of ‘ designer babies ’			1
the technology 's patent includes a list of traits that are n't necessarily related to health – such as eye and skin pigmentation , according to a report by @entity144 in @entity145			1
‘ where it is more ethically challenging is when you expand beyond couples in desperate need for a donor , to couples that are just interested in more trivial things , ’ @entity146 at the @entity147 told the magazine			0
professor @entity157 said that they are still undecided about what the patent will be used for in the future			0
he added that owning the patent means the firm can prevent it from falling into the wrong hands .			0

@entity19 - based @entity20 is about to launch a service in the @entity22 capable of digitally combining the dna of two people to create ‘ virtual babies ’
virtual babies can be screened for diseases to ruling out sperm donors
technology is 100,000 times more powerful than *current* screening services
in theory , it could be used to screen babies for traits other than diseases
