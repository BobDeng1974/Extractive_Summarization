by @entity0 published : 22:00 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 19:22 est , 20 august 2013 leading researchers have warned family doctors are wasting time on the ' worried well ' instead of treating people who are actually sick @entity7 health checks offered to the over- 40s are useless , causing needless worry and diverting resources from sick patients , it was claimed yesterday			1
but health ministers insisted that the flagship £ 300million - a - year screening programme could save up to 650 lives each year and prevent 1,600 heart attacks and strokes by spotting warning signs early			1
launched in 2009 for people aged 40 to 74 , it has led to 1.3million receiving a health ‘ @entity21 ’ over the last year			1
it is now to be rolled out across @entity24 after being tested in a variety of areas			2
but @entity28 researchers claim the @entity29 operates in ‘ direct conflict with the best available evidence ’ and is likely to lead to patients taking drugs they do not need			1
researchers from the @entity35 analysed 14 international trials involving 183,000 people receiving routine checks but found none of them cut deaths , kept people out of hospital or prevented disability			2
as a result of the study , the @entity44 has reversed its plan for regular checks			0
and following concerns , a review of the @entity7 breast screening programme last year concluded that for every life saved by screening , four women underwent unnecessary surgery			2
the latest study comes as the government steps up its plan to make the @entity7 less of a sickness service and more pro-active			0
but psychiatrists have already labelled plans to screen for early dementia among older people visiting their gps for other reasons ‘ a disaster in slow motion ’ because patients without symptoms could be wrongly diagnosed			0
while gps have backed this dementia scheme , dr @entity70 , chairman of the @entity71 , said she was concerned about mass health screening			1
‘ through mass screening of untargeted populations , we are identifying risk factors , not diseases , and it is inevitable that we will identify people who might have “ abnormalities ” , ’ she said			2
‘ these will usually disappear or turn out to be irrelevant , but we run the risk of putting people on unnecessary medication or worrying them unduly			0
’ researchers from the @entity35 say the @entity29 programme ' operates in direct conflict with the best available evidence ' and is likely to lead to patients taking drugs they do not need ( file picture ) health minister @entity93 said the screening programme tackled the shocking variation in health outcomes across the country , and was shifting the system from dealing only with the effects of illness to also promoting wellness			1
‘ we could save 650 lives a year , prevent 1,600 heart attacks and strokes , and prevent over 4,000 new cases of diabetes if there was full take - up , ’ he said			1
‘ early research findings and experience are positive that @entity111 are reaching those most in need and helping to reduce their risk of ill health			0
’ @entity116 , chief executive of @entity117 , also supports routine checks , saying they could uncover an estimated 850,000 people with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes			0
@entity70 , chairman of the @entity71 , backed the centre 's calls to end routine checks , saying they ' devalued medicine ' she said : ‘ far from being useless , there is good evidence that , if properly implemented , it could prevent thousands of cases of type 2 diabetes a year , as well as having a positive impact for heart disease , kidney disease and stroke			1
‘ and while the £ 300million it costs to run might sound like a lot of money , diabetes and other chronic conditions are expensive to treat			1
‘ this means that once you factor in the savings in healthcare costs , the @entity111 is actually expected to save the @entity7 about £ 132million per year			2
’ although many patients like the ‘ insurance ’ value of a health check , figures last month showed that less than half of those invited for one ( 49 per cent ) attended the appointment			0
the aim is 70 to 75 per cent			0
dr @entity151 , medical director at @entity24 , said : ‘ we know there is a huge burden of disease associated with conditions such as heart disease , stroke , diabetes and kidney disease			0
‘ many of these long - term conditions can be avoided through modifications in people ’s behaviour and lifestyles , and this is what the @entity111 programme aims to do			0

£ 300 million - a - year scheme to be rolled out across @entity172
@entity28 researchers warn @entity29 in ' direct conflict with evidence '
health ministers say ' @entity21 ' could prevent diseases such as diabetes and strokes
