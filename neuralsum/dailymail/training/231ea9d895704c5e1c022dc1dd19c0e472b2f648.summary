by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:01 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 05:41 est , 18 june 2013 little ground breaker : @entity3 is the first baby to be born using a new @entity5 treatment he 's only seven weeks old , but little @entity3 is already a pioneer			1
his birth – the result of a groundbreaking technique dubbed ‘ the natural ivf ’ – could offer hope to thousands of women who are currently unable to have children			1
while conventional @entity5 involves the mother being injected with artificial hormones , baby @entity3 was conceived with a new method that uses a naturally occurring hormone , kisspeptin			1
this helps produce eggs in a safer way for the mother and avoids some of the risks associated with traditional @entity5			1
@entity3 ’s mother @entity24 said she was thrilled with her ‘ groundbreaker ’ baby , who was born in april weighing 7.5lb after a ‘ normal , healthy pregnancy ’			1
and while mrs @entity29 is the first to give birth , ten more women are expecting babies following the breakthrough study at @entity34 ’s @entity5 unit in @entity35 , conducted with @entity36 , @entity35			1
experts hope the treatment could be widely available in as little as two years			2
‘ we are over-the - moon to have @entity3 , ’ mrs @entity29 said			1
‘ we feel so lucky to have him			0
' it shows it does work and to know that we have helped move ivf treatment on is great			2
’ mrs @entity29 , 34 , had tried for years to get pregnant after marrying husband @entity44 , 31 , a project manager for a construction firm in 2008 , but with no success			0
after being diagnosed with ‘ unexplained ’ fertility problems and referred for conventional @entity5 on the @entity48 at @entity34 , mrs @entity29 , who works as a credit manager , became pregnant with son @entity51 , now two , in march 2011			1
although they longed for another baby they were not entitled to any further rounds of @entity5 on the @entity48			1
bundle of joy : @entity3 , seven weeks , with his parents , @entity24 and @entity59 and older brother @entity51 new technique : compared to traditional @entity5 treatment , where artificial hormones are used , which the @entity64 underwent with two year old @entity51 , @entity3 was conceived using natural hormones the pair were attempting to save the £ 6,000 required to pay for the treatment privately when mrs @entity29 spotted a poster advertising the new kisspeptin @entity5 trial at @entity34 and phoned straight away to see if she was eligible			1
conventional @entity5 uses injections of high levels of ovary - stimulating drugs to mature eggs faster for collection			2
but there are well - recognised risks to the mother if the ovaries are over-stimulated , known as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome			2
this can endanger her life by leaking excess fluid into other parts of the body , leading to blood clots			0
the risks are particularly serious for women with polycystic ovaries			0
@entity90 is a naturally occurring hormone that researchers suspected could be successfully used as a safer way to induce a woman ’s eggs to mature and become ripe for fertilisation			1
in normal pregnancies the body produces a surge of luteinizing hormone ( @entity101 ) , which supports egg maturation and triggers ovulation			0
in traditional @entity5 an injection of human chorionic gonadotropin ( @entity106 ) mimics this			1
however , it can overstimulate the ovaries in women at high risk , especially those with polycystic ovaries			0
the @entity90 , which has been produced in a synthetic form by the researchers , acts on the pituitary gland and sets off this lh surge			0
she began to receive the trial treatment in july last year			0
' i did n’t notice any difference at all from when i had the conventional @entity5 with @entity51 , ’ she said			2
a fertilised embryo was implanted within days of the final injection and mrs @entity29 discovered she was pregnant just three weeks later			0
the study looked at the effectiveness of using kisspeptin to induce egg development in place of conventional hormone injections			2
in regular @entity5 , the hormone injections that are used for egg development can trigger a serious condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( @entity132 )			1
this results in over-stimulation of the ovaries – causing too many eggs to be released			0
in some rare cases , this condition can even lead to death			0
those most at risk are women who can not have children because they have polycystic ovary syndrome ( @entity143 )			0
as many as one in 12 women has @entity143 , in which the polycystic ovary has tiny cysts around the outside , thought to be follicles that have failed to develop properly to release an egg			0
for those women , this safer treatment is a major breakthrough			2
professor @entity158 , of @entity36 , said : ‘ the results of the study are very encouraging and whilst we are primarily looking at women most at risk of developing @entity132 , there is the potential kisspeptin could be used across all ivf treatments as a more natural alternative			0

new @entity5 technique using naturally occurring hormone kisspeptin
@entity3 , seven weeks , is first child born as result of new treatment
kisspeptin safer for mothers and avoids some risks of traditional @entity5
