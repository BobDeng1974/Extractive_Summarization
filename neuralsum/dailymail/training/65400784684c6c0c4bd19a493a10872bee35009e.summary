usually seen snarling as part of an intimidating mass of synchronised marching , the soldiers from the tyrannical nation show their softer , more human side in these new images from @entity16 photographer @entity15 , 47			1
mr @entity15 took the snaps during six trips to the secretive state			1
elsewhere females happily pose for the camera , while one takes time out of her duties to stroke a stray dog sprawled out on the ground			2
speaking of his unique insight , @entity15 said : ' the army in @entity6 is everywhere - in the fields , at the fun fair , in museums			1
even he 's smiling : leader @entity63 pats a goat on the head high jinks : the military attire is the same but the faces are different as the soldiers ' expressions of happiness are quite different from the usual snarls not a care in the world : these three soldiers prove there is more to life in @entity6 than synchronised marching beaming : another soldier has a laugh and a joke ' they have opened two new fun fairs recently and they are packed every night			0
' i had the opportunity to meet some army personnel			0
they were mostly young and once away from the chiefs , are just like any other teenagers in any other country			2
' they liked football and were crazy for @entity93 and @entity94			0
it is only in the @entity96 that they do not really smile			0
" spectacular : women dressed in @entity5 costume dance during an event at the @entity101 in @entity102 relaxed : soldiers chat and smoke while taking a break what a day : the soldiers leave the fair and ca n't contain their happiness attention : a saluting soldier flashes a smile in a field @entity15 's trips captured the diverse life of soldiers in the country where conscription is universal			1
mandatory service in the country is between three and five years , with selective conscription for females			2
@entity15 added : ' i wanted to document the life of soldiers in @entity6 because they are totally a part of the nations identity			1
propaganda : a military poster in the capital shows the more unsavoury side to the country ' if you remove them , you remove probably 30 percent of the people you see on a day - to - day basis			1
' i spoke to soldiers in the @entity96 who were there to make a speech to the hundred or so tourists , but as i met them for the third time they spoke about @entity143 and their defence			0
' they had a lot of humour			0
when i asked them where all the @entity151 were on the other side of the border , they said " mr @entity15 , it is half past 12 , the @entity151 are having lunch ! " '			1
familiar site : teenagers during their induction to the @entity5 menacing : a teenager during his conscription to an army which contains more than a million troops camera shy : this soldier is n't as happy to be photographed as some of his colleagues			0
