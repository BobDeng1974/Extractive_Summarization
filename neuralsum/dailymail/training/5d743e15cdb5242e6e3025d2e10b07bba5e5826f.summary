ex-pm @entity0 received a briefing about ufos from the @entity3 because of his concerns over the disclosure of classified information on extraterrestrials former prime minister @entity0 received a briefing about ufos from the @entity3 because of his concerns over the disclosure of classified information on alien life - forms			0
@entity11 requested the advice for the pm in 1998 as the @entity14 was being introduced , which allowed the public to obtain information on alien mysteries			0
mr @entity0 's concerns were raised after he received a letter from a member of the public referring to a ' cover - up ' and asking him to make @entity24 reports and other information available			2
according to @entity26 , mr @entity0 sought advice from the @entity3 for their policy on the issue			0
he was told by staff at the ministry that it has ' only a limited interest in @entity24 matters ' but that they ' remained open - minded ' about ' extraterrestrial life forms '			2
details of the briefing emerged yesterday ahead of today 's release of files by the government of more than 6,700 pages detailing seemingly close encounters with ufos over the last 30 years			1
among a series of @entity24 sightings in the files is a policeman 's report of a mystery cluster of lights darting across the sky during an @entity52 replay between @entity53 and @entity54			1
the mounted officer ’s claims to have seen the bright object hovering over @entity57 in march 1999 for almost 15 seconds , slowly changing shape , were corroborated by a colleague			2
the ‘ credible witness report ’ is one of a series investigated by the @entity3 , whose top - secret files are being released in sections by the @entity65 following the closure of the ministry ’s @entity24 desk in 2009			1
it also speculates on the reasons why aliens may be visiting @entity72 , including for military reconnaissance , scientific research , or just to enjoy the scenery and partake in some tourism			0
the policeman claimed that he saw something ‘ unlike anything i ’ve seen before ’ at @entity57 while @entity54 beat @entity53 2 - 0 in the @entity52 quarter final replay			1
@entity24 expert @entity99 ( above ) predicted the @entity100 would be a prime time for extraterrestrials to make an appearance fiction to fact : with so many sightings , governing bodies are taking notice and not discounting it as science fiction @entity24 expert @entity99 says he said a ‘ square to almond shape ’ yellow object with four lights floated silently above his horse			1
another file describes a @entity118 hotelier who saw a @entity24 landed in a field			1
two ‘ faceless humanoids ’ in silver suits emerged and took measurements			2
one of the @entity124 ’s top @entity24 experts , @entity99 , who worked at the @entity3 for 20 years , investigated reports of @entity24 between 1991 and 1994 , and says he began his research as a sceptic , before becoming convinced that the sightings raised important defence for national security and air safety issues			1
@entity133 summer events like the upcoming @entity134 in @entity135 would be a prime time for crafts from other worlds to present themselves to mankind , according to mr @entity99			1
he said : ' it has been a widely held belief in @entity3 circles that " aliens " have been able to detect us for decades via tv and radio broadcasts			0
' what once seemed like science fiction is steadily being realised by central governing bodies as distinctly real			0
' if aliens have studied our psychology , they may choose to appear in our skies on a significant date – the closing ceremony of the @entity134 is one date being widely circulated by conspiracy groups			0
’ video : @entity124 's x-files revealed ! from biscuit - shaped ufos to bright lights in the sky ! ...			0
