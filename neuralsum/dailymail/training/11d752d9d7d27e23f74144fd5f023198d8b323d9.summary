selfies and self - indulgent @entity2 statuses suggest we are more narcissistic than ever			0
but researchers have found we actually started to become increasingly self - centred more than 100 years ago			0
by studying unique baby names , birth and divorce rates and the use of words like ' i ' and ' me ' in books , the experts said individualism began rising at the turn of the 20th century			1
individualism is the belief that personal needs are more important than the needs of society as a whole and this rise is blamed on a shift from manual labour to office jobs as people became wealthier and better educated			1
individualism is the belief that personal needs are more important than the needs of society as a whole			1
it is said to have first developed among @entity36 , born after @entity37			1
the study covered a 150 - year period and was carried out by researchers from the @entity41 at the @entity42 and @entity43			0

the researchers examined factors commonly thought to be linked with cultural individualism			0
these included the use of so - called individualist words in books , such as ‘ i ’ and ‘ me ’ , during the past 150 years			1
they also looked at the percentage of single - child families , how many adults now live alone , divorce rates and the prevalence of unique baby names			1
all of these factors , especially uniqueness , are deemed to be key drivers of individualism			0
led by professor @entity68 , the researchers examined factors commonly linked with cultural individualism			0
these included the use of so - called individualist words in books taken from the @entity75 database			2
they studied the percentage of single - child families , how many adults now live alone , and divorce rates using @entity83 @entity82 data			2
and they looked at the prevalence of unique baby names by studying @entity86 data			2
all of these factors , especially uniqueness , are deemed to be key drivers of individualism			0
the team additionally studied changes in infectious disease and disasters , rates of urbanisation , changes in secularism , and job trends			2
’ across many markers of individualism , social class was the only factor that systematically preceded changes in individualism over time , tentatively suggesting a causal relationship between them , ’ explained professor @entity68			2
across all cultural indicators , the researchers found evidence that individualism has been rising steadily for more than a century			0
for example , family size has decreased since 1860 and the number of households with multiple generations living under the same roof has declined since the 1880s			0

@entity127 's daughter ( left ) is called @entity128 and @entity129 ( right ) called her son @entity131 from this research , the experts said individualism has been rising over the past 150 years			1
family size has decreased since 1860 , for example , and the frequency of individualist words in books has risen			2
this trend is blamed on a shift from manual labour to office jobs ( stock image ) at the turn of the 20th century the frequency of individualist words used in published texts has risen since the 1860s , and the frequency of ‘ collectivist ’ words , such as ‘ we ’ , has declined over the same period			1
‘ as demands of @entity83 society shifted from manual labour to office jobs , @entity83 gained education and wealth , both of which promote self - direction and ultimately facilitate individualism , ' said the study 's authors			1
‘ the data show that changes in individualism were present way before the @entity168 and the @entity170 generation , indicating that the magnitude of change in individualism was comparable in the late 19th and early 20th century as it is now			1
‘ this insight puts some of the pop - science claims about current youth in a historical perspective : yes , current youth are different from older generations , but this seems to be a consistent phenomenon over time			0
’ the researchers are currently working on expanding this research outside the @entity83			0
@entity184 , the uniqueness of baby names has risen for both boys and girls since the 1880s , with the percentage of children receiving one of the 20 most popular names declining over time			2
the prevalence of infectious disease , job trends , and secularism were all linked with individualism over time , but the researchers found that only changes in occupational status appeared to precede these changes			0
‘ we were surprised that only one of the six tested cultural psychological theories was any good for statistically predicting changes in @entity83 individualism over time , ’ said professor @entity68			2

individualism is the belief that personal needs are more important than the needs of society as a whole
it is said to have first developed among @entity36 , born after @entity37
experts studied baby names and birth rates over the past 150 years
they also studied the changing use of ‘ individualistic ’ words in books
@entity255 said individualist *behaviours* began at the turn of 20th century
and this was blamed on a shift from manual labour to office jobs
