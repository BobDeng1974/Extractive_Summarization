who is @entity7 ? ratings have plummeted for the ‘ today ’ show , which now plays second fiddle to @entity12 ’s ‘ @entity11 ’ in the battle for top morning news program			1
@entity15 was the last ‘ today ’ host to face the axe for sinking ratings			2
now , @entity7 ’s popularity has hit an all - time low and he ’s facing the blame , too			0
way out : @entity7 's claim to the daytime throne may have ended , but some say he could move on to host ' @entity2 ' as @entity1 exits cue @entity23 , owner of the popular game show , who are now reported by the @entity27 to be courting @entity7 to be their next host			1
exiting : @entity1 has hosted the popular game show since 1984 , but his age and health complaints mean his current contract , up in 2016 , is his last current host @entity1 has hosted ‘ jeopardy ’ since it was rebooted in 1984			1
he also suffered his second heart attack last summer and it has been reported that he wants to retire			0
@entity23 has managed to keep @entity1 onboard for another three years , however			1
meanwhile , their feelers are now out in search of a new host to replace the man whose name is synonymous with ‘ @entity2			0
’ one of those names is @entity43			0
the @entity46 host ’s contract is up soon and he ’s hosted game shows before — @entity12 ’s ‘ @entity48			0
’ the more likely candidate , however , appears to be @entity7			0
@entity7 ’s been on ‘ today ’ since 1994 and host since 1997			2
last year , he signed a multi-year contract that was rumored to pay the host a whopping $ 25 million per year			1
at the time , @entity54 president @entity53 told the @entity55 , ' @entity7 is the franchise , and our franchise player has decided to keep leading our team			0

( photo by @entity70 / @entity69 ) many believe @entity7 ’s sunken popularity may be largely to blame			0
this has insiders speculating that @entity7 could take seriously the offer of a new gig as ‘ jeopardy ’ host			1
@entity7 ’s lucrative ‘ today ’ contract ends in 2014 , which would give him a long vacation before potentially filling @entity1 ’s shoes when the ‘ @entity2 ’ host ends his own run in 2016 .			1

plummeting ' today ' ratings have insiders *doubting* if @entity7 will be kept on when his $ 25 million a year contract is up in 2014
@entity1 's name is synonymous with the ' jeopardy ' *brand* , which has @entity23 *scrambling* to find a *viable* replacement when his run ends in 2016
@entity43 is also reportedly a person of *interest* in the quest to replace @entity1
