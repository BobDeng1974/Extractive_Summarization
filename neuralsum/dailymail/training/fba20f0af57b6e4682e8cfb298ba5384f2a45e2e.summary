if i ’m honest , i ’m rather partial to the underdog			2
come @entity2 time , i ca n’t help myself			2
i ’m all for the painter , decorators and bin men who take on the full - time professionals			1
what ’s more , who was n’t cheering for @entity9 when he took on the might of @entity11 and nearly won ? and lest we forget , @entity12 seeing off @entity14 and his entire gang of thieves in @entity17 without any shoes on ! however , when it was announced that @entity20 were going to be in the frame when the @entity22 highlights package comes up for grabs in 2016 , i found myself rooting immediately for the top dog			1
@entity26 ( from left to right ) , @entity27 and @entity28 pictured on saturday 's @entity29 @entity30 ( from left to right ) , @entity31 and @entity32 during the @entity22 on @entity20 years ago @entity33 ( left ) chats with @entity34 and @entity35 during @entity20 's coverage of an @entity38 game not that i have anything particularly against @entity20 and their @entity33 - led football squad			1
after all , they were considered by many to have had a more than decent @entity43			1
the broadcasts playing as they did to the avuncular , ‘ everyman ’ personality of the host			2
more recently , they did a perfectly decent job of bringing @entity38 ’s trip to @entity52 to terrestrial telly			2
while of course they have been regularly delivering @entity55 to our homes for no extra charge			2
the big deal here though is that their work is done best as live coverage			2
slapped with gusto across your evening ’s entertainment - 10.30pm on a saturday night , though ? well that ’s a different matter			2
that has become a nigh on religious experience for football fans looking to find their saturday football in a nutshell			2
and that is what @entity29 provides			1
and we know this , as much as anything else , because for a few uncomfortable seasons , it did n’t			2
i ’m not a @entity81 fan at the best of times			0
but i managed to build up quite the dislike for them when their ‘ @entity86 ’ welcomed us to @entity20 ’s version of @entity29			1
what ’s more , the programme then went on to make @entity30 look ordinary in the process , which should practically be against the law			0
presenter @entity30 pictured during his debut for football coverage for @entity95 after his move from @entity97 @entity32 , @entity30 and @entity31 pose with the @entity22 trophy ahead of launching @entity20 's new show @entity81 's ' @entity86 ' used to precede @entity20 's version of @entity29 ... and grew on people 's nerves des just did n’t look right in a show that felt like it spent as much time flogging us soap powder as it did showing us the highlights			1
i know it ’s a commercial channel , and it does that job very well			0
but come late saturday night , those frequent two minute pauses were like little daggers to the heart			0
this news has a particular piquancy in a season when @entity29 has upped its game			1
@entity119 ’s retirement rang out of the old , and the new has seen the show flourish			0
helped , ironically , by the frequent neat reminders that it also happens to be the show ’s 50th anniversary			0
been there , done that			0
it does n’t hurt to have an ex pro with an exceptional playing career at the helm , of course			0
@entity26 may look like he ’s after a job in the @entity134 during @entity135 , but is actually now nailed on as the best telly host in football			1
and with @entity27 apparently freed up since @entity119 ’s departure and really getting his act going with his fellow striker , you surely ca n’t see why you ’d want that chemistry to change ? @entity26 remains the host of @entity29 on @entity97 , which airs most saturday nights at 10.30pm @entity27 ( left ) and @entity28 ( right ) were the experts on @entity29 this week @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 chew the fat over the day 's @entity22 football on saturday night saturday provided some great examples of this			1
@entity150 has perfected the art of knowing when to let his experts do the talking , and when to chip in			1
such as when @entity155 was in the process of telling us @entity158 were ‘ a million miles off ’ , and @entity26 chipped in quickly ‘ why ? ’			1
he wanted evidence of their lack of title credentials			0
and @entity27 provided it , with analysis that has improved dramatically from him during the last year			0
he also let @entity27 let rip on his fellow pundit on the night , @entity28			0
he said he ’d have been ‘ disappointed ’ if he ’d got a red card for @entity168 ’s nigh on three footed challenge at @entity167			0
‘ you ’re having a laugh , ’ cried an incredulous @entity27 as the two went at it			0
as the dust settled , @entity26 simply observed , ‘ red card all day ’ and moved along			1
despite this mishap before @entity176 vs @entity38 , @entity95 have gotten better at presenting live football @entity178 ( right ) was mocked for his @entity178 's @entity179 during @entity20 's @entity22 show @entity26 also knows when to unlace his boots , put on his slippers and just be a fan			1
in response to @entity186 ’s dive at @entity187 , he told his fellow panellists ‘ footballers do themselves no favours			0
it ’s an embarrassment ’			0
few at home would disagree with him			0
as mentioned earlier , being a fan is where @entity33 comes in			0
but he is not so skilled at getting out of the way again			0
that simply would not wash in a highlights show at the business end of saturday night			2
i think it needs to avoid too much faff , and steer a pretty straight furrow through the highlights and talking points			1
that has never proved to be the @entity20 way			1
in the end , money may talk			1
which could potentially see yet another big money move for the @entity22 highlights			1
but i personally think it ’s clear where they have their natural home			0
somewhere you would n’t be hearing too much @entity217			0
@entity20 's @entity218 ( from left to right ) , @entity219 and @entity220 , and @entity178 down the front			1

@entity26 has perfected the art of knowing when to let his experts do the talking and when to chip in on @entity97 's @entity29
the @entity22 was on @entity20 between 2001 and 2004 before @entity29
@entity20 want to be in the frame for @entity22 highlights package in 2016
they have gotten better at covering live football , evident at the @entity43
the @entity97 should retain the highlights package - but money may talk
