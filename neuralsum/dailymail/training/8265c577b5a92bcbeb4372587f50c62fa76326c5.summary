by @entity0 published : 08:48 est , 20 january 2013 updated : 17:35 est , 20 january 2013 president @entity1 was sworn into his second term on sunday at noon in front of only his wife and two daughters in a simple service			1
his younger daughter @entity7 said ' good job , daddy ! ' after he correctly recited the oath of office			0
' i did it ! ' he gleefully responded			0
sure to keep him on his toes , he followed that up with a quick ' you did n't mess up ! ' scroll down to watch keeping it brief : mr @entity1 had his immediate family beside him at the ceremony , but reports also say that his other relatives were also present but out of the camera 's line close bond : mr @entity1 got a happy hug from older daughter @entity24 and @entity7 ( right ) told him ' good job , @entity26 ! ' after he completed the oath			1
' you did n't mess up ! ' the swearing in ceremony took place on sunday in keeping with the laws states in the @entity34 which states that presidents ' terms begin at noon on january 20			2
normally the oath of office is given on the steps of the @entity41 and is followed by his address to the nation , but because this year it happens to fall on a sunday - and inaugurations are never held that day of the week - the oath of office was given quickly in the @entity47 of the @entity48 instead			1
swearing in : president @entity1 took his oath of office on sunday just before noon , officially marking the start of his second term big moment : the oath was given quickly and held inside the @entity48 because it is sunday and the inauguration ceremony will be held tomorrow keeping it in the family : mr @entity1 opted to be sworn in on a @entity59 that has been in mrs @entity61 's family for some time when president @entity1 takes the oath again tomorrow in front of the packed mall , it will be his fourth time doing so			1
@entity61 showed off her new bangs along with a royal blue dress and cardigan by @entity70 designer @entity69 at the swearing - in ceremony			0
the @entity72 and daughter @entity24 matched the president 's blue suit , also complementing the @entity47 of the @entity48 , where the small ceremony took place			1
younger daughter @entity7 , however , went her own way : she wore a lacy pink dress with a gold , wide - width , high - waisted belt - a style her mother helped popularize - and gold shoes			0
it 's not the first time mrs @entity61 chose a design by @entity69			0
she previously has worn a gown and jacket by the designer , who also is the president and executive creative director of @entity91 she has carried one of his tote bags , too			0
her hairdo , however , is a change - and it has been the subject of online chatter since its debut on thursday in a photo taken at the @entity48			0
only the president 's immediate family and a few relatives were present , along with a crew of journalists to witness and televise the event			2
aside from thanking chief justice @entity106 after the oath - and joking with his younger daughter that ' i did it ! ' - mr @entity1 did not make any remarks before heading back out of the @entity47 and back to business			2
mr @entity106 , who famously floundered at mr @entity1 's 2008 inauguration , carried a piece of paper and read the quick oath without any stumbles this time			1
because he did not recite the oath of office word - for - word in in 2008 , mr @entity106 had to perform a second official service inside the @entity48 in the days following			1
though they were not seen on cameras , a number of his relative were apparently in attendance - including his sister and her family , and first lady @entity61 's brother @entity128 and his family and her mother , @entity130 , who lives with the @entity24 in the @entity48			0
mr @entity1 opted to give a nod to mrs @entity61 's relatives by choosing to be sworn in with his hand resting on the @entity128 's family bible			1
reading it carefully : chief justice @entity106 famously floundered when he read the oath of office to mr @entity1 in 2008 , but he was careful to make no mistakes this time around signs of approval : @entity61 gives @entity1 a kiss after he read the oath and @entity24 gives her dad a big hug all smiles : though they looked serious during the actual ceremony , everyone appeared happy after it was done few fans : only a handful of relatives were invited to attend the private ceremony on their merry way : @entity106 follows the @entity156 after the exit watching : the cameramen from the @entity159 watched and recorded the oath mr @entity1 attended church with his family before the ceremony , and laid a wreath at the @entity165 alongside vice president @entity166 , who was also sworn in for his second term this morning			1
@entity156 was a theme of the morning 's ceremony as mr @entity166 opted to take his oath of office with his hand over a bible that has been owned by the @entity166 clan since 1893			1
@entity176 @entity175 swore 70 - year - old @entity166 into his second term before she rushed off to catch a train to her hometown of @entity179 so that she could attend a book signing			2
second term : vice president @entity166 was sworn in by @entity176 @entity175 sunday morning ' an honor ' : @entity166 was pleased that @entity175 pushed back her travel plans in order to perform the oath friendly tone : the vice president took the oath in front of 120 relatives and friends ' i want to explain to you what a wonderful honor it was , and how much out of her way the justice had to go			1
she is due in @entity179			0
she has to leave right now			0
so i apologize : we 're gon na walk out , ' mr @entity166 told the crowd after they applauded his oath			2
' her car 's waiting so she can catch a train i hope i have n't caused her to miss. ' the @entity176 smiled before quickly exiting along with the vice president and his wife dr @entity206			1
' and i am leaving - going and gon na meet the president ( for ) the traditional laying the wreath at 2 over in @entity210			0
and we 're having breakfast			0
i 'll be back , they tell me , in 40 minutes			0
i hope of some you will still be here , ' he said			0
happy moment : mr @entity166 was surrounded by family members when he was sworn into office tradition : mr @entity166 used his family 's @entity59 which they have owned since 1893 the ceremony was held at the @entity223 which doubles as the vice president 's residence			1
it opened with a prayer by reverend @entity228 , a practicing @entity229 priest who is the vice president of @entity231 's @entity230			1
the selection of rev. @entity228 comes as little surprise since the @entity234 often attend mas at @entity236 just one block from the college campus			0
after rev. @entity228 finished his prayer , the attention went to @entity175 and mr @entity166 who repeated the oath after her			2
religious touch : reverend @entity228 ( right ) , who is a member of the faculty at @entity231 , gave a blessing before mr @entity166 took the oath of office pucker up : mr @entity166 kissed one of his grandsons as the rest of the family claps on dr @entity166 , who kept the apparent color - coordination going as she and her husband were wearing varying shades of blue , was in charge of holding the family @entity59			2
they were surrounded by mr @entity166 's children - including @entity259 and @entity260 - and some of their five grandchildren			0
once the oath was said , @entity166 and dr. @entity206 went to meet the president and first lady at a service at the @entity266 , though he said that he planned to return to the breakfast with his extended family within the hour .			1
