by @entity0 as one of her predecessors sir @entity2 might say , ‘ did n’t she do well ? ’ @entity6 has been announced as the host of a revival of the @entity9 , making her the first woman to present the show			1
@entity13 controller @entity12 confirmed that the star of @entity15 and sitcom @entity6 is in talks with the corporation about the programme , which is due to return to our screens next year			1
good game , good game : @entity6 recreates @entity2 's legendary pose in an interview last year she said : ‘ we are working closely with @entity6 on how a modern day gen @entity26 would work , whilst she continues to be committed to her work as an exceptional actress			1
it ’s an exciting process			0
’ her comments came after miss @entity6 , 41 , appeared to distance herself from the revival yesterday , tweeting : ‘ apparently it ’s 100 per cent cert i am doing gen @entity26			2
first i ’ve heard of it			0
mulling some ideas about it might be more accurate			0
’ she also said that the idea ' is one of a few private brainstorms '			0
the show is fondly remembered by millions for its cheesy catchphrases and conveyor belt of less - than - thrilling prizes that always included a cuddly toy			2
at its peak in the late 1970s , it pulled in an astonishing 20 million viewers every saturday evening , first with @entity2 at the helm and then @entity50			1
@entity2 , whose best known lines included ' did n't they do well ? ' , ' @entity53 to see you , to see you , nice ! ' , and ' give us a twirl ' , then returned for a four - year stint in 1990 before @entity58 presented it from 1995 to 2002			0
challenge : @entity6 took to @entity61 to let fans know the @entity64 report was the ' first ' she had heard about her ' confirmed ' appearance on the show , before tweeting today that the idea is ' one of a few private brainstorms ' @entity6 , the star of the @entity13 sitcom @entity6 , has already appeared in a @entity72 version of the show and described it as ' one of the greatest game shows ever '			1
the @entity13 controller , @entity12 , told the @entity64 : ' it will be a modern reinvention of the @entity9			1
' @entity6 will bring a very different flavour to it			1
her wit and spirit behind it will naturally move it into the modern era			0
@entity6 is brilliant at engaging with people , she loves that interaction			2
' @entity6 is a huge fan of the show and sang its praises in an interview she did with @entity2 last year			1
she said : ' @entity2 is too modest to say this but i am going to say it for him			0
during the 1970s the @entity9 was getting over 20 million viewers every week and my family were among them			1
it is one of the greatest game shows ever			2
' she even defended the programme when @entity2 himself said it might now be considered ' old hat '			0
@entity9 : @entity2 , right , and @entity103 , centre , in action on the show			0
at its peak in the 1970s it pulled in 20million viewers a week the show 's format involved couples of family members competing against each other in a series of challenges			1
typically the couples comprised family members who were a generation apart , such as mother and son			0
the new generation game is likely to be tweaked to make it relevant for a modern audience but insiders expect all the classic ingredients to remain the same			0
it is not known who will be @entity6 's co-host and whether the job will go to a man or a woman			2
one of hostesses in the original show , @entity103 , famously had an affair with @entity2 and married him in 1973 before divorcing him six years later			0
the @entity13 hopes the new version will prove as popular as @entity137 , which pulls in more than 11 million viewers .			1
