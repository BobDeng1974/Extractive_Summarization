by @entity1 reporter published : 16:24 est , 3 august 2012 updated : 16:46 est , 3 august 2012 @entity4 's ex-wife told her sister that she believed he would kill her , then begged her sister to take care of her two sons , just six weeks before her death , the sister testified on friday			1
@entity10 provided the trial 's first testimony including what prosecutors have called ' from the grave ' statements -- comments @entity4 's ex-wife @entity16 allegedly made to others about him threatening to kill her well before her body was found in her bathtub			1
@entity4 is charged with first - degree murder in the 2004 drowning death of @entity22 , his third wife			1
he was charged in @entity22 's death after his fourth wife , @entity25 , went missing in 2007			1
@entity4 's ex-wife 's sister told the court : ' @entity16 said that @entity4 told her he was going to kill her , she was not going to make it to the divorce settlement , she would not get his pension or his children ' grave charges : @entity4 is accused of murdering @entity16 , left			1
it was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the bathtub , right , but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a homicide hearsay evidence about what @entity22 allegedly said to other people is crucial to prosecutors , who have acknowledged they have no physical evidence linking @entity4 to @entity22 's death			1
' she said that @entity4 told her he was going to kill her , she was not going to make it to the divorce settlement , she would not get his pension or his children , ' said @entity10 , referring to what prosecutors have said was a settlement involving two homes , a tavern @entity4 and @entity22 owned and @entity4 's pension from his career as a @entity54 police officer			1
' she made me promise over and over that i would take care of her boys , over and over ( she said ) , " i want to hear you say it because everything 's going to them "			0
' @entity62 , or statements not based on the direct knowledge of a witness , is not usually admissible in court			2
but @entity68 judges can allow in murder trials under certain circumstances			0
@entity10 's testimony was the most dramatic so far in the trial that , since beginning on monday , has been beset by a series of prosecutorial blunders that prompted the judge to seriously consider granting a request by @entity4 's attorneys to declare a mistrial			2
judge : @entity80 decided against declaring a mistrial in @entity4 's murder case on thursday , saying the former police officer still can get a fair trial despite several blunders by prosecutors sketch : @entity4 , left , looks on as defense attorney @entity89 cross examines @entity16 's neighbor , @entity90 , as they view a photo of @entity22 's lifeless body in the tub of her home but during intense cross examination , @entity10 acknowledged she did n't tell police about @entity22 's alleged comments until three years later , shortly after @entity4 's fourth wife , @entity99 , disappeared			1
@entity4 has been named a suspect in that disappearance but has not been charged			2
' you sat on that for three years , ' defense attorney @entity89 said to @entity10 , who acknowledged never voicing any suspicions about @entity4 to the county coroner or police after @entity22 died			1
she also said she invited @entity4 and his sons to a banquet at a @entity109 hall shortly after @entity22 's death			0
@entity10 did not dispute @entity89 's assertion that when she did come forward with details and documents about @entity22 , it was not to police , but to a producer from @entity117 's cable television show -- one of many media representatives who descended on @entity4 's @entity54 home after @entity25 disappeared			1
@entity10 said ' no one would listen ' when she tried to call police , but she acknowledged she did not have any documentation of the calls she said she made			1
she also quietly admitted under cross-examination that after her sister 's death she never tried to get custody of @entity22 's children or even contact them or send them birthday or @entity132 cards			0
@entity10 's testimony was cut short on friday after the judge recessed the court because of a sick juror			1
a male juror had been repeatedly coughing and testimony had been interrupted several times to let him recover			0
in memoriam : flowers and a small angel statue surround the grave marker of @entity16 , the third wife of @entity4 , at the @entity144 in @entity145 , @entity68 before the recess prosecutors had planned to call a retired @entity148 sergeant who was in charge of the investigation of @entity22 's death and a crime scene technician who responded to @entity22 's house the night her body was found			1
judge @entity80 said the trial would reconvene on tuesday			0
a furious @entity80 admonished prosecutors on wednesday after the second witness in just their second day of testimony began talking about finding a .38 - caliber bullet on his driveway			0
@entity164 , a former neighbor of @entity22 's , hinted in his testimony that @entity4 may have planted it there to intimidate him			0
prosecutors later admitted under tough questioning by the judge that there was no evidence to support the claim			0
and @entity80 wondered aloud about whether the testimony made @entity4 appear menacing in jurors ' eyes and undermined his ability to get a fair trial			0
but after heated arguments by both sides on thursday morning , @entity80 told attorneys that ' the court believes that the defendant 's ability to receive a fair trial is not extinguished at this time '			2
yesterday : attorneys for @entity4 , from left , @entity89 , @entity187 , and @entity188 listen as @entity189 , a friend and spokesperson for the family of @entity25 address the media during a recess in court prosecutors : will @entity197 state 's attorney @entity196 told the court during opening statements that @entity4 killed his wife and made it look like an accident prosecutors contend @entity4 killed @entity22 and tried to make it look like an accident			1
defense attorney @entity188 told jurors repeatedly during his opening statement that there was no evidence @entity22 's death was anything but a tragic accident			2
his defense attorney 's argued on tuesday that @entity4 was a victim of a 24 - hour news cycle and cable tv 's talking heads , which together created a media frenzy that did not subside until prosecutors had charged an innocent man			0
will @entity197 state 's attorney @entity196 told jurors that @entity4 , 58 , killed @entity22 , 40 , and made it look like an accident			0
' just weeks before her death , he told her he was going to kill her and she would not make it to a divorce settlement and would never get his pension , ' @entity196 said during opening statements			1
@entity4 's real - life drama inspired a tv movie and a national spotlight was put on the case , as many speculated whether @entity4 used his law - enforcement expertise to get away with @entity22 's murder and make 23 - year - old @entity25 vanish			2
distress : @entity239 and @entity22 , parents of @entity4 's third wife @entity16 , return to court as he stands trial for her murder missing : @entity4 , right , is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife , @entity25 , right the outcome of the trial may also hang on which forensic pathologist the seven men and five women on the jury will believe : @entity251 or @entity252			1
@entity251 , who investigated @entity22 ’s death in 2004 and ruled that a gash on her head and bruises on her body were consistent with an accidental fall , died earlier this year			2
the defense will likely call expert witnesses to testify that the woman ’s death was accidental			0
@entity252 , who investigated @entity22 's body after it was exhumed in 2007 , will testify for the prosecution at the trial about what made him switch the cause of death from an accidental fall to homicidal drowning			2
‘ first , they are not going to be able to say that ( the death investigation was botched ) because it was n't , ’ @entity4 's attorney said			0
‘ by saying that if they had done a better job in the investigation , then they would have been able to prosecute @entity4 , that lowers the burden of proof			0
where you do n't have evidence , you presume innocence			0
