by @entity0 last updated at 1:45 pm on 17th november 2011 could a 15 ton bunker buster that blows apart 200ft of concrete be the bomb that stops @entity5 's adversaries from developing nuclear weapons ? the @entity7 has unveiled the @entity8 - dubbed the @entity8 - and speculation is already mounting that it may be used in airstrikes on @entity11 or @entity12			1
@entity13 will use the six metre long gps guided rocket , fitted with 2.5 tons of explosives , to smash open underground bunkers and tunnels suspected of containing weapons of mass destruction			1
he added that the $ 32 million contract with aerospace firm @entity28 would see eight of the devices delivered to ' fulfil the @entity7 's operational needs '			1
the delivery of the super bomb comes as @entity5 president @entity44 today said @entity5 would act firmly against any nuclear proliferation activities by @entity12			1
and it is in the same week an @entity48 report renewed calls for a pre-emptive strike against @entity11 's nuclear facilities			2
in a speech to the @entity54 @entity53 , @entity44 said the transfer of nuclear material by @entity12 to other nations would be ' considered a grave threat to the @entity5 and our allies '			1
ramping up : the delivery of the super bomb comes in the same week an @entity48 report renewed calls for a pre-emptive strike against @entity11 's nuclear facilities transporter : @entity13 ( pictured ) will use the six metre long gps guided rockets to hit underground bunkers and tunnels suspected of containing weapons of mass destruction he said he would hold @entity12 , which has tested two nuclear devices since 2006 and is believed to be working on a long - range missile designed to reach the @entity5 , ' fully accountable for the consequences of such action '			1
the multi-billion pound drug trafficking trade in @entity11 has been seized by its @entity77 , former regime officials claim			2
they say @entity77 members are using it to establish links with a global crime network and further its goal in undermining the @entity86 , say former regime officials			0
the alleged smuggling of heroin , opium and meth is in complete contrast to the @entity94 hard - line reputation as defenders of the @entity96			0

they have their own ships , aircraft and haulage companies			0
' his warning came amid efforts to restart negotiations with the country on dismantling the nation 's nuclear programme			0
meanwhile , the @entity48 's report focused on @entity11 's alleged efforts to fit a nuclear warhead on a missile			0
and it claimed @entity11 has been working to acquire equipment and weapons design information , testing high explosives and detonators and developing compute models of a warhead â€™s core			1
it led to the @entity5 ramping up pressure on the country , which it suspects of building nuclear facilities deep underground to thwart any possible air raid			1
