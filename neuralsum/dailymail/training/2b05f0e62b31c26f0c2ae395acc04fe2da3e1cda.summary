two men have been arrested on suspicion of sexually exploiting children in @entity2 as part of an ongoing investigation into historical allegations			1
the men , aged 35 and 39 , were arrested today on suspicion of committing a number of sexual offences against underage girls between 1990 and 2001			1
it comes after the @entity12 report earlier this year revealed that at least 1,400 children were abused by gangs of men , predominantly of @entity17 origin , in @entity2 , @entity18 , between 1997 and 2013			1
police said attempts are currently being made to transfer the men to @entity18 for interview			2
the arrests come professor @entity12 ’s report into historic sex abuse in the @entity41 in which she criticised the way in which police and @entity45 dealt with complaints from teenage girls who said they had been raped and trafficked by gangs of mainly @entity50 men			1
the controversy that followed the publication of the report led to a series of high - profile resignations including @entity2 council leader @entity56 , council chief executive @entity57 and council director of children 's services @entity61			1
the most high - profile resignation was that of @entity18 's police and crime commissioner @entity63 , who was the @entity2 councillor overseeing children 's services between 2005 and 2010			1
he had defied demands from political leaders of all parties to resign and refused to see why he should take any blame before later having a change of heart and quitting ‘ for the sake of the victims ’			0
@entity18 's chief constable @entity74 has also been under pressure to explain his force 's attitude towards child sexual expolotation over the last 15 years			2
earlier this week , further details emerged of how police turned a blind eye to the horrific crimes and even blamed the young victims			0
police executed search warrants at five properties before arresting two men in connection with historic child sexual exploitation			1
attempts are currently being made to transfer the men to @entity18 for interview one police officer could be seen searching a black car outside one of the properties in @entity24 earlier today a number of incidents have now been referred to the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) , which is investigating 14 former and serving police officers			1
two of the incidents referred to the watchdog involve police arresting the victims of reported abuse while no action was taken against alleged offenders			0
in one case , a mother of an alleged victim was told it would breach her 13 - year - old daughter 's human rights to examine her mobile phone , following interactions with 150 @entity50 men			0
the spotlight first fell on @entity2 in 2010 when five men , described by a judge as ' sexual predators ' , were given lengthy jail terms after they were found guilty of grooming teenage girls for sex			1
the five men - @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity126 , @entity126 , and @entity128 - preyed on their victims over several months and threatened them with violence if they refused their advances			0
one of the men branded his victim a ‘ white bitch ’ when she resisted , while a second smirked : ‘ i ’ve used you and abused you			0
' the men , all @entity136 - born @entity17 , attacked the four girls in play areas , parks and in the back of their cars , @entity141 @entity140 heard			2
the damning @entity12 report published earlier this year revealed that at least 1,400 children were abused by gangs of men , predominantly of @entity17 origin , in @entity2 , @entity18 , between 1997 and 2013 today ’s arrests were made after search warrants were executed at five properties in @entity24 , @entity25 they gave them gifts and introduced them to their friends			1
the girls were abused so frequently that after many months it ‘ became a way of life ’			0
the girls , who were being monitored by social services , were eventually rescued by police and removed from their homes amid growing concerns for their safety			0
in her report , professor @entity12 said senior police and council officials must have known what was happening but failed to act , with staff reluctant to report their concerns out of fear of being called racist			2
children as young as 11 were trafficked , beaten , and raped by large numbers of men between 1997 and 2013 , the council commissioned review into child protection revealed			2
more than a third of the cases were already know to agencies , but according to professor @entity12 : ' several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist '			0
she condemned the ' blatant ' collective failures by the council 's leadership , concluding : ' it is hard to describe the appalling nature of the abuse that child victims suffered			0
' in her report , professor @entity12 ( pictured ) said police and council officials must have known what was happening but failed to act			2
the report revealed children as young as 11 were trafficked , beaten , and raped @entity18 's police and crime commissioner @entity63 ( pictured ) , who was the @entity2 councillor overseeing children 's services between 2005 and 2010 , resigned earlier this year after public outcry fears had also been raised by schools over the 16 years but the alerts went un-investigated			1
teachers reported seeing children as young as 11 , 12 and 13 being picked up outside schools by cars and taxis , given presents and mobile phones and taken to meet large numbers of unknown men in @entity2 or other local towns and cities			1
the majority of victims believed the perpetrators to be their boyfriend who gave them gifts , alcohol and drugs			0
some of the victims still maintain they were not groomed or abused			0
analysing the case studies , professor @entity12 said many of the children came from dysfunctional families , had parents with addictions , and had suffered domestic or sexual abuse as a child			2
anyone with concerns about child sexual exploitation should contact police on 101 or @entity243 anonymously on 0800 555 111			0
