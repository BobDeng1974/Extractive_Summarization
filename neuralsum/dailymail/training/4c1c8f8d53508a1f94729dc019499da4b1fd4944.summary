by @entity0 published : 08:57 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 13:27 est , 29 july 2013 ' 100 per cent sure ' : @entity1 , 40 , who is charged with wasting police time , is seen arriving at @entity3 the neighbour of @entity7 's grandmother told police he was ' 100 per cent ' sure he had seen the murdered schoolgirl when she was already dead , a court heard today			1
@entity1 , 40 , risked derailing the police hunt for the 12 - year - old by lying about seeing her just before she was reported missing , it is said			1
he claimed to have spotted @entity14 leaving her grandmother 's home in @entity17 , @entity18 , on august 3 , last year			1
but her grandmother 's boyfriend @entity7 , 37 , had murdered @entity14 the previous night , bundled her body into plastic bags , and hidden it in the loft			1
@entity26 backed up @entity28 's bogus claim that @entity14 had gone missing after leaving to meet friends in @entity31 town centre , @entity3 heard			1
he made a statement about the supposed sighting just after noon last august 3 , telling officers : ' i 'm 100 per cent sure in my heart it was @entity14 , and i know it was her walking down that path on friday			2
' ' while @entity14 was missing , he told police on several occasions that he had been standing outside his own property and had seen @entity14 leave the property in @entity45 at about noon on friday , august 3 ' , said prosecutor @entity46			1
' he was thereby confirming @entity7 's account of her leaving , walking out of the front door at that time , apparently never to be seen again			1
' in fact , this was impossible at the time he claimed to have seen @entity14 , because she was already dead			2
' as a result , he immediately became a figure of importance in the investigation , as he became the last person to see @entity14 alive			2
' when @entity14 was initially reported missing , a massive manhunt was launched with members of the local community joining officers to search for the schoolgirl			2
significant resources were then diverted towards investigating @entity26 's claim , the court heard , and he maintained his story up until @entity14 's body was finally found			1
' mr @entity1 's false confirmation of @entity28 's account through his statement led police down an incorrect and unnecessary lines of investigation ' , said ms @entity75			1
' it compounded the family 's false hopes that she may be alive			0
' police spent time and money investigating his story and attempting to find corroborating evidence			2
' it was a waste of valuable resources at a critical time that could have delayed finding @entity14 's body and the detention of @entity7			1
' ms @entity75 said @entity26 first made the bogus claim on august 6 , three days after @entity14 was reported missing , but he had been keen to help police in the missing person 's search before that			1
he searched online for images of the trainers @entity14 had been wearing , emailing pictures of them to the officers investigating , and offering to ' keep and eye out ' for the missing girl			0
@entity26 is said to have learned @entity28 's bogus story about @entity14 going missing when officers and family members were at his home on august 6			1
he claimed to have been having a cigarette on his porch , and knew it was around midday because the news headlines had just begun , the court heard			0
after reporting his claims to police , @entity26 told his wife and boss at work that ' top brass ' at the police would want to speak to him			1
false hope : @entity7 , 12 , ( left ) had already been murdered by @entity7 ( right ) at the time @entity26 claimed to have seen her leaving her grandmother 's home he texted his wife to say : ' if police have their way , top brass will want my statement			1
' when interviewed by police , @entity26 gave a detailed description of @entity14 , wearing headphones and with her hair up in a ponytail			1
' he was emotional during the interview , expressing regret at not having spoken to her ' , said ms @entity75			0
' at the interview , his statement leaves no room for doubt as to who he had seen , including her clothing , where , and when			0
he expressed himself to be sure with 100 per cent certainty			0
' @entity26 , a bus driver with @entity146 who volunteers with @entity147 and with @entity148 , told police : ' how do you describe a 12 - year - old walking care - free ? ' there did n't seem to be any urgency in her walk at all			1
she just seemed like a 12 - year - old walking care - free			1
' it seemed she was preoccupied ' , he said			0
' i saw her left profile and back , i thought she had headphones in so i did n't say anything			0
when @entity14 's body was eventually discovered , on august 10 , @entity26 started to backtrack on his claims , saying he was no longer sure it was @entity14 he had seen , the court heard			1
he was arrested and interviewed over the bogus claims , and was charged in february this year with wasting police time			1
@entity28 admitted murdering @entity14 in may this year , and was jailed at the @entity171 for at least 38 years			2
the alcoholic window cleaner , who had previously served time for drug dealing , brazenly joined the search for @entity14 and even gave a tv interview appealing for help			2
but there was no suggestion , after extensive investigations , that @entity26 knew anything about @entity28 killing @entity14			1
the bus driver told the court that although he now accepts it could not have been @entity14 , he believed his statements to police were true at the time			1
@entity26 said he did not initially tell police about the potentially vital sighting when first asked on august 4 , the morning after she had been reported missing , because he had just woken up			2
but he claims he did pass the information to an unidentified officer the following day			0
' i was tired and i was n't fully awake when the door knocked on saturday afternoon ' , he said			0
' i had just woken up , but i 'm sure i said it to one of the officers			0
' @entity26 said his memory of seeing the girl leaving his neighbour 's house returned ' at the end of saturday into sunday '			2
he told @entity206 about the sighting just before midnight on sunday , when he was at the house @entity28 shared with mrs @entity210			0
' are you really telling us the truth ? ' , asked prosecutor @entity46			0
' you were aware the granddaughter from next door was missing , you knew police were making enquiries , and you have seen her			0
' you had woken up , came to your senses , found out it was all really true , and you kept that information to yourself for the best part of a day ? ' but @entity26 reasserted that he had already mentioned it to another officer , and did not think he needed to repeat it to @entity226			0
' as far as i was concerned , i had mentioned it to an officer prior ' , he said			0
' i ca n't be responsible for how they deal with it			0
' frequently flustered under cross-examination , @entity26 repeatedly told the court : ' at the time i made my statement to @entity226 , i believed it to be true			1
' but ms @entity75 told him : ' you told what you thought would be a white life , something you believed was true , but something you had n't seen at all			0
' you did that to draw attention to yourself , to draw attention to yourself as the last person to see @entity14			0
' but @entity26 responded : ' i came forward doing something i thought would be the right thing			0
' asked if he still remembered seeing a girl leave the house that day , he told the court : ' i still have a recollection of someone - knowing it is not @entity14 - but i recollect someone walking up the path			1
' my recollection is still clear in my mind , even if it ca n't be true			0
' @entity26 has one previous conviction , on april 17 , 1998 , for theft at @entity261 , for which he was given 80 hours community service and ordered to pay Â£ 470 compensation			0
expert witnesses will now be called to give evidence on @entity26 's state of mind when he spoke to police			2
@entity26 may be suffering from a false memory that makes him believe he did actually see @entity14 that day , an expert psychologist told the court			1
dr @entity273 told magistrates that @entity26 may have a ' confabulated memory ' , a common problem which causes the sufferer to believe something that is not true			2
' it is entirely possible in this case ' , he said			0
' what we have heard today was the way mr @entity1 's memory changed over time			2
' his early memory was n't entirely sure , but then he became more sure as he keeps telling it			0
' he suggested there was an absence of personality defects or a motive to life , this was the most likely explanation of @entity26 's claims			2
' it is one of the possibilities , although i believe in considering all the possibilities i can think of , it seems to me a likely possibility			0
' dr @entity273 said @entity26 showed no signs of being a compulsive liar			0
and he suggested there was no sign that @entity26 was hoping to enhance his importance by claiming to have seen @entity14			2
dr @entity273 added that @entity26 appeared confused at times during his evidence , but this may have been a side effect of the anti-depressant medication he is taking			1
@entity26 , who now lives in @entity308 , denies wasting police time			1
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
