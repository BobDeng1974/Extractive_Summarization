by @entity0 a @entity2 woman is suing a hospital and two doctors , claiming she was forced to undergo a cesarean section against her will			1
@entity7 was a 32 - year - old mother of two boys who had been delivered via cesarean section			2
she decided that with her third pregnancy , she wanted to have a @entity12 , or vaginal birth after cesarean			1
forced ? @entity7 , pictured , claims doctors at @entity16 forced her to have a c - section overruled : doctors at @entity16 performed a c - section on @entity7 against her wishes ( file photo ) however , when she arrived at @entity16 in labor , dr dr @entity24 began pressuring her to have another cesarean section , she said this week			1
@entity7 's attorney @entity27 told @entity28 that after @entity7 had been in labor for several hours the attending physician would not examine her unless she agreed to have the surgery			1
@entity24 told her that she was putting her baby at risk and that her uterus would rupture if she did n't have the surgery , @entity7 told @entity35			0
the doctor also said that not having the surgery was tantamount to child abuse , and that her baby would be taken away from her if she refused , @entity7 said			1
hospital records show that the cesarean section was approved by the hospital 's legal department and dr @entity42 , the director of maternal and fetal medicine			1
' the woman has decisional capacity			0
i have decided to override her refusal to have a c - section , ' he wrote in her case notes			1
@entity27 , a specialist in medical malpractice , said that this is the first case in which he has seen a woman 's refusal to have a cesarean section overruled			2
generally , he said , women who are reluctant to have cesarean sections are eventually talked into have the procedure			0
according to @entity7 's complaint , not only did the hospital ignore her express wishes not to have the surgery , but they also failed to consult the bioethics department and did n't engage the hospital 's patient advocate , reports @entity28			2
@entity7 , having already undergone two c - sections , was reluctant to endure a third , due to the after - effects of the surgery			0
force : dr @entity42 ( left ) wrote that he was ' overriding ' @entity7 's refusal to have a c - section , while dr @entity24 ( right ) allegedly pressured @entity7 about having a c - section as soon as she arrived at the hospital she did her research and believed she may be a successful @entity12 candidate			1
@entity7 raised the issue with physicians in the @entity79 group and they indicated a vaginal birth was a possibility for her			2
new guidelines set out by the @entity84 state that @entity12 is a safe option for most women , including those who have had multiple previous cesareans			0
@entity84 states that respect for the patient 's decision - making requires that a cesarean birth can not be forced nor can care be denied if a woman refuses a cesarean during labor			2
the guidelines also note that a @entity12 means the patient avoids serious abdominal surgery , lowers a woman 's risk of hemorrhage and infection and can shorten post-partem recovery time			0
during the surgery to which @entity7 never agreed , the doctor perforated her bladder			0
no comment : the hospital can not address the legal issue , but a spokesman says it has a good record of both cesareans and @entity12 ( vaginal birth after cesarean ) dr @entity24 , in court papers , denied that he had carried out the surgery against @entity7 's will			1
he said that her own ' culpable conduct and want of care ' were to blame for any injuries she sustained			0
according to the @entity124 , almost 33 per cent of births are by cesarean section , a rate that has been climbing since 1996 for various reasons , including a desire by mothers and doctors to schedule deliveries and fear of malpractice lawsuits should the baby be injured during a normal delivery			0
the @entity35 reports that the hospital has defended its actions , saying that its 22 per cent cesarean section rate is much lower than the state average of 34 per cent , and that as of 2012 , its vbac rate was at 29 per cent compared to a state average of 11 per cent			0
court documents state that dr @entity42 claims @entity7 's baby was ' at risk for serious harm without the c - section			1
' @entity7 , now 35 , says she begged @entity24 to give her more time to give birth to her child naturally			0
as she lay on the operating table , he told her , ' do n't speak , ' reports the @entity35			0
@entity7 is suing the doctors and the hospital for malpractice , alleging they ' improperly substituted their judgement for that of the mother ' and ' pressuring and threatening ' her during the birth of her youngest son , @entity160 , who was born in july 2011 .			1

@entity162 , 35 , says she was forced to have a cesarean against her will
she had already had two cesareans and wanted a natural birth for her third child
@entity7 says doctors indicated she could be a good candidate for @entity12 ( vaginal birth after cesarean )
when she went into labor , she claims doctors at @entity16 began pressuring her to have the surgery
when she refused , she was told she was committing child abuse and that her baby would be taken away , she says
dr @entity42 , director of maternal and fetal medicine , wrote that ' the woman has decisional capacity . i have decided to override her refusal to have a c - section ' in @entity7 's case notes
