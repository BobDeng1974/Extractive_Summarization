@entity0 and her ex fiance @entity1 are embroiled in a legal fight over her frozen eggs which they planned to have children with before their bitter split , a new report claims			1
@entity1 has filed a lawsuit in @entity9 in a bid to prevent the @entity12 actress from destroying two cryopreserved female embryos created through @entity14 , according to @entity15			1
@entity0 â€™s representatives declined to comment on the allegations when contacted by @entity18 on wednesday			0
court documents , filed under pseudonyms @entity21 and @entity22 , detail how the couple fertilized embryos using her eggs and his sperm six months before their split in november 2013			1
the lawsuit was first filed in august 2014 before it was refiled again on april 1 with updated information and after @entity1 sought new legal representation			2
another claim in the documents is that , previously , the pair twice had eggs implanted in a surrogate , but the procedure failed			2
elsewhere in the lawsuit , it is claimed 42 - year - old actress @entity0 - who got engaged to @entity53 hunk @entity51 on christmas day after six months of dating - was ' physically and mentally abusive ' to @entity1			1
wrangle : the lawsuit has been filed under the pseudonyms @entity22 and @entity56 no directive : ultimately , the outcome will be at the discretion of a judge , but it would be unlikely that @entity1 would be able to use the embryos without @entity64 's consent , according to a legal expert who spoke to @entity15 the documents state : ' she punched him in the face on two occasions , kicked him , and threw her phone at his head			1
she also routinely bullied him , calling him a " loser , " " worthless " and other degrading names			0
' in april 2013 @entity75 - who has a 23 - year - old son @entity77 from her first marriage - spoke publicly about having frozen her eggs and her desire to have more children			1
she revealed that she and @entity1 - who she dated on - off for almost four years - planned to use a surrogate on the account that she had thyroid cancer in 2000 and , as a result , had a lot of radiation			2
complicated matter : in this page of the document it states @entity64 and @entity1 were planning on using a gestational surrogate in 2012 to start a family and that @entity64 had insisted on using a 44 - year - old friend and emloyee arduous process : after the first two embryos failed to implant in the first surrogate the couple looked for another suitable candidate getting ugly : page five of the document further details @entity64 and @entity1 's disagreements over the usage and disposal of the embryos and also alleges @entity64 was physically , emotionally and mentally abusive to him @entity15 has previously claimed that now @entity0 and 38 - year - old @entity51 have found a surrogate and plan to have children of their own			1
the actress recently told @entity111 magazine that while having another child would be ' weird ' , it something she might do if it made @entity51 happy			0
she told the magazine : ' my son , @entity77 , is 23 years old , which is going to be really weird if i have another baby			0
but , you know , @entity51 wants babies and if it 's going to make him super-happy , then ... ' the complicated legal wrangle with @entity1 still stands , though			0
moving on : the @entity12 actress is now engaged to @entity51 and there are rumours the couple are planning to have children of their own via a surrogate other documentation obtained by @entity15 which forms part of the lawsuit shows that @entity56 ( @entity0 ) asked that the embryos be destroyed in the event of her death , while @entity1 refused to agree to this condition			1
no agreement was made between the couple about what would happen to any frozen eggs in the event they ended their relationship			0
ultimately , the outcome will be at the discretion of a judge			0
however legal experts told @entity15 that it would be unlikely that @entity1 will be able to use the embryos without @entity64 's consent			2
