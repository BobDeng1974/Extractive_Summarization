by @entity0 published : 06:20 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 09:52 est , 24 september 2013 a severe weather warning has been issued across @entity2 tomorrow , as temperatures are set to plummet to -88c tomorrow - followed by a leap of @entity5 to @entity6 later in the day			1
or at least that 's the forecast according this morning 's @entity8 - which flashed up the somewhat extreme conditions on a satellite map during this morning 's show			1
weather presenter @entity12 stood in front of the screen as it showed how freezing temperatures - only ever found at the @entity17 in the depths of winter - descended upon @entity19 , @entity20 and the @entity21 for tomorrow morning at 5am			1
' the rest of @entity35 is under the influence of a weather front ... ' ms @entity12 began - as the technical blunder was noticed			2
a temperature of @entity6 would have put @entity2 at the top of the weather record map - the hottest confirmed temperature on earth being a comparatively cool @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 the freak conditions would be fairly isolated , the map suggested , as the rest of the country was forecast to enjoy normal to pleasantly warm temperatures for the time of year , ranging from @entity53 in the morning to @entity54 later in the day			1
ms @entity12 's colleagues were quick to point out the technical blunder			0
presenter @entity58 said : ' @entity6 is well above average , i do n’t know what clothes to wear now			0
' co-presenter @entity61 joked : ' when you said changeable , i did n’t know quite what you meant			0
' ms @entity12 tried to explain the slip - up , saying : ' the new data must be coming into the system			2
' the @entity8 said : ' this was a technical glitch that we fixed as soon as it was noticed			0
' hotting up : @entity12 turns to show viewers how the temperature is likely to rise a few degrees as the morning progresses oops : the moment ms @entity12 recognised that she had been upstaged by the satellite screen all along the hottest ... ... and the coldest			0
