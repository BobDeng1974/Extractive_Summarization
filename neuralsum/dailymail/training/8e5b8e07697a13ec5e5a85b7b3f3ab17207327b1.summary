ms @entity1 , 29 , of @entity16 , said her daughter was vomiting up to 10 times a day for more than two months , had problems with her balance and agonising headaches before her diagnosis			2
she added : ' @entity1 was a shell of herself by the time she was diagnosed			1
' when they took me aside , they said she had a growth and i asked if it was cancerous			0
it was a relief in a strange way			0
' days after her cancer was diagnosed , @entity1 was on the operating table			1
however , surgeons were unable to remove all of the tumour , because of its size and location			0
' it ’s such a fast growing aggressive tumour			2
if they had caught it before they might have been able to remove it all			0

this has stabilised the cancer but it is likely to return in a more aggressive form			0
ms @entity1 and her best friend @entity77 , 28 , have launched a fundraising campaign to send @entity1 to the @entity7 for @entity56 , which delivers a more precise dose of radiation without killing healthy tissue surrounding the tumour			1
conventional radiation could leave her severely mentally impaired			1
' we know she is going to need radiation and @entity56 radiation is targeted - it ’s like the difference between a shotgun blast or a sniper , ' explained ms @entity1 ' but here the conventional type is the only option and that ’s going to leave her with no quality of life			1
' we were turned down for treatment as they said @entity1 was a very complex case , and because it ’s so advanced			2
