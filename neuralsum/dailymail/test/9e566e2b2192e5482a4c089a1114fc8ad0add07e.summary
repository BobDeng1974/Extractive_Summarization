to mark the point at which @entity3 's season really began to turn around , you have to go back further than the win against @entity5 last month			1
the truth is that a dark , cold night at @entity7 in mid-february is more significant			0
@entity3 were poor that night in the @entity8 at @entity9 , coming from behind to win			2
that , however , was the night @entity12 was restored to a centre - forward position , the night @entity10 finally began to realise the best place from which his best player and captain should lead was from the front			1
@entity3 captain @entity12 has been returned to his preferred position up front the 29 - year - old had previously been deployed in midfield this season and @entity3 had struggled now , manager @entity10 ( left ) looks set to unleash an in - form @entity12 on @entity23 on sunday @entity3 actually lost their next game at @entity25 but have subsequently won their next five in the league , with @entity12 scoring four times			1
incredibly , given the pattern of this season , they head into sunday 's derby game with @entity23 as slight favourites			1
prior to that night in @entity32 , @entity12 was on the verge of knocking on his manager 's door to ask for an explanation about his deployment in the centre of midfield			1
it seemed as though @entity42 was about to experience his first very real problem at @entity44			0
whether he sniffed something in the air , we will never know			0
but @entity42 performed a sharp volte face at just the right time and @entity12 has gone on to become the most significant figure in @entity3 's return to relevance			1
at @entity44 , just as he has since @entity53 left for @entity54 almost six years ago , @entity12 represents the most serious threat to @entity23 's prospects			1
prior to the win over @entity5 , @entity12 stood before his team - mates in @entity60 's @entity59 and delivered an impassioned call to arms			2
he is once more the central figure at his club , in more ways than one			0
' i think some people mix up scoring goals with form , ' said @entity42 yesterday			0
' for us @entity12 is very important as a player , as a captain and because he can score goals			2
but he can do that from midfield , too			0
the last goal he scored — against @entity76 — came when he was playing in midfield			0
' @entity42 's mid-season deployment of @entity12 in midfield remains a sensitive subject			1
no coach likes to admit he may have been wrong			0
all that matters now , though , is the 29 - year - old 's current trajectory , which is undoubtedly upwards			0
his name is written right through recent derby history of course			0
he is the fixture 's record goalscorer and the scorer of one of its most spectacular goals , that remarkable overhead kick back in 2011 that some @entity23 supporters , rather oddly , still maintain came off his shin			2
previously there had been the transfer saga of autumn 2010			0
courted heavily by @entity23 as he prevaricated over a new @entity3 contract , @entity12 most definitely had his head turned			1
to this day , rumours persist of meetings in an underground car park at the @entity103 — that one has always seemed a little fanciful — and promises of a salary in excess of £ 300,000 per week			0
@entity12 scores his side 's second goal during @entity3 's 3 - 1 @entity111 victory over @entity76 what we do know is that there was a point when @entity23 and their manager @entity116 thought the transfer was about to happen			1
so , too , did many @entity3 fans			2
' @entity119 and you 're dead ' warned graffiti on a city - centre poster carrying his image at the time			0
had it done so then these fixtures would probably never have been the same again			0
as it is , derby day now finds @entity12 even more fired up and motivated than ever			2
city have won the last four and one only has to scroll through the tapes to watch the @entity134 centre forward 's body language , especially during last season 's 4 - 1 reverse at the @entity103 , to see exactly how that has gone down			2
@entity12 may be a @entity138 but he understands the @entity23 rivalry better than most at his club			1
in @entity142 , @entity12 has the opportunity to ease @entity3 clear of @entity145 's team			1
when asked yesterday if he has a leader of the @entity3 captain 's ilk in his squad the city manager was less than convincing			1
' every squad has different kinds of personalities , different players , ' said @entity145			0
' all of them have different options to motivate in different ways			0
' i do n't think it 's good to analyse the personality of our captain			2
in a squad you must have not just one leader , not just the captain			0
' @entity23 captain @entity168 has been struggling with a hamstring injury but is expected to play against @entity3 , albeit with discomfort			1
he has admitted @entity12 's volley of 2011 stayed with him for some time and it 's little wonder			1
it remains a stand - out memory of recent fixtures and @entity12 now finds himself in the perfect position to contribute some more			2
rooney scores a sublime over-head kick during the @entity60 derby at @entity44 back in 2011 @entity23 captain @entity168 is expected to play in sunday 's derby , albeit in some discomfort			1

@entity12 has returned to his preferred striking position
he had been deployed in midfield earlier this season
manager @entity10 has restored his captain to leading the line
@entity12 's return up front has *coincided* with @entity3 's *stunning* form
@entity3 are slight favourites for sunday 's derby with @entity23
