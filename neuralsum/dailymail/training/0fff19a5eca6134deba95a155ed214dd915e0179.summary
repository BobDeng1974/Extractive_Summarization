by @entity0 two student pilots are seated shoulder to shoulder before a bank of video monitors , maneuvering an unmanned aircraft by keyboard and mouse as the drone descends toward a virtual runway in a suburban landscape			2
@entity14 and @entity15 , aviation students at the @entity12 and self - proclaimed video - game junkies , could just as well be sitting on a couch playing @entity17			1
but instead of tapping their fingers on a controller , they 're learning to fly the plane and use onboard equipment that includes a camera with a zoom lens as they continue their studies on their $ 150,000 course			1
learning : @entity12 aviation students @entity15 , left , and @entity14 operate a @entity30 simulator as part of their training to fly unmanned aircraft wednesday , oct. 1 , 2013 , in @entity35 , @entity36 ' some people argue that nothing is going to be like flying an actual airplane			1
granted , looking down and seeing you 're 5,000 feet above the ground is pretty exciting , but i 've always been addicted to video games , and this is awesome , ' @entity15 said			2
mastering the @entity30 simulator is the first practice course for the two trainees , who are among hundreds of student pilots nationwide preparing for jobs that do n't exist yet			1
they and their classmates are eager to cash in on the booming market for drone operators that 's expected to develop after more unmanned aircraft become legal to fly in @entity55 airspace , which could happen in the next few years			1
the university 's unmanned aircraft degree program , the nation 's first , exploded from five students in 2009 to 120 students last year			1
@entity61 and @entity62 have since added similar programs			2
dozens of other schools offer some courses in what 's known as @entity68 — unmanned aircraft systems — which range from drones as big as small planes to 2 - foot - wide mini-helicopters			2
the first @entity68 master 's degree program , focused on engineering , was launched at @entity61 's @entity75 , @entity76 , campus this fall			2
@entity12 aviation students @entity15 , left , and @entity14 operate a @entity30 simulator as part of their training ' this pie is pretty big , ' said @entity83 , director of @entity12 's unmanned aircraft program			1
' everyone can get their little slice of the pie , because we ca n't do all the training in @entity36			1
' the skills needed to fly larger unmanned planes are not unlike those required to fly modern aircraft with computer - based flight controls , professors say			2
the toughest part of unmanned flying comes with doing it from the ground : you ca n't feel what 's going on			2
' you do n't have feedback , ' @entity15 said			2
' when you push the yoke forward in the aircraft , you feel yourself and everything going down			2
with this , you just see it			0
' drones are best known for their use by the @entity55 military , but other markets beckon			0
@entity115 made a splash earlier this month by unveiling an embryonic effort that might someday deliver packages by drone , though the company acknowledged practical use is years away			1
most of the potential civilian drone market is in precision agriculture			0
unmanned aircraft are already used for seeding and spraying in @entity126			0
drones may be used someday to detect disease in crops , depending on the development of sensors			0
the potential applications for other unmanned aircraft are endless , said @entity134 , president and ceo of the @entity136			0
non-military : @entity12 aviation student @entity138 lifts a lightweight drone used in training at the @entity35 , @entity36 school 's unmanned aircraft program the @entity143 , which can fly for 20 hours on a couple of gallons of fuel , was originally developed to help commercial fishermen find and track schools of tuna			1
the @entity150 has used the plane to watch pirates			0
in recent years , @entity36 law enforcement and the university have used the drone to monitor rivers during flood threats in the @entity158			1
for students , it all adds up to strong job prospects after graduation			1
' whether it 's designing a vehicle to go into forest fires or catch poachers in the @entity168 , they 're getting opportunities to be part of the next generation of aerospace like no one else is , ' said @entity174 , @entity61 spokeswoman			0
many students who grew up wanting to be commercial airline pilots are changing their major to unmanned systems			1
among them are self - proclaimed computer geeks who do n't mind staying in one place			0
' airplanes are cool and fun and all that stuff , ' said @entity138 , a student at @entity36			1
' but it 's my particular personality that i do n't really want to fly big jets			0
growing up around computers and having a love for aviation , i figured the best option was to combine the two of them			0
' inspiration : workers prepare an @entity195 unmanned aerial vehicle for static display at @entity197 , @entity198 in @entity199 in this september 15 , 2011 @entity201 handout over the last decade , it 's gotten much tougher to get a job as an airline pilot			0
many pilots started out at smaller regional airlines , but pay there is poor , and airlines are shifting away from smaller planes			0
meanwhile , growth has been minimal at major @entity55 airlines , cutting the number of new jobs for pilots , and bankruptcies have reduced pay			1
compare that to the outlook for drones			0
the @entity220 projects some 7,500 commercial drones could be aloft within five years of getting widespread access to @entity55 airspace			1
an industry commissioned study last spring predicted more than 70,000 jobs would develop in the first three years after @entity227 loosens restrictions on @entity55 skies			1
the same study projects an average salary range for a drone pilot between $ 85,000 and $ 115,000			1
a @entity55 @entity235 @entity234 unmanned aerial vehicle assigned to the @entity237 's @entity236 flies near the @entity238 in @entity239 , @entity240 @entity83 , the @entity12 instructor , said one of the first graduates in the school 's @entity68 program took a job with a @entity240 aeronautics company for $ 50 an hour			1
' that 's probably not bad for a kid out of college , ' @entity83 said			0
the hopes for civilian drones might not be realized as quickly as many people in the business had hoped			0
concerns about security , privacy and whether drones will be able to detect and avoid other aircraft could push the grand opening beyond a 2015 deadline set by @entity227			2
in the meantime , @entity36 's unmanned aircraft students are looking to master the @entity30 simulator			1
then they advance in january to train for the larger @entity234 and @entity265 drones			0
' that is what a lot of employers are looking for , ' aviation student @entity266 said			0
' that 's why i came to school here			0
this is the @entity275 of aviation			0

four year course in @entity36 can set back students by up to $ 150,000
an industry commissioned study last spring predicted more than 70,000 jobs would develop over the first three years
