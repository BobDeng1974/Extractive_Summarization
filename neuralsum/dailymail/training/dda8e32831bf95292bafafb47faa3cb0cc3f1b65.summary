@entity16 , pictured with daughter @entity23 , ' begged ' doctors not to let her baby die after ambulance staff failed to treat her as an emergency , an inquest has heard @entity23 was born with a complex heart condition and underwent three operations at @entity12 in 2013			1
on july 24 , the four - month - old had a stent procedure to improve oxygen flow to her lungs and began vomiting the following day			0
@entity23 was discharged on july 26 but became ' shivering , shaking and pale ' on the journey to her home in @entity37 , @entity12 , her parents claim			1
her mother , 21 , reported @entity23 's condition to the hospital but was told to take her to see a gp as it was ' nothing to worry about ' , @entity38 was told			1
a receptionist at the gp surgery refused to schedule an appointment as @entity23 appeared too unwell and her parents rushed her to @entity12			1
after an examination , @entity47 and partner @entity48 were informed @entity23 had gastroenteritis and would be discharged with @entity51			2
but just 10 minutes after returning home , @entity23 went into cardiac arrest and miss @entity16 had to perform cpr while an ambulance was called			1
' the ambulance arrived within 10 minutes and the paramedics did not think there was anything wrong with @entity23 , ' miss @entity16 told the inquest in a statement			1
ambulance crew did not appreciate @entity10 - @entity9 's ' time critical ' condition as they were driving her to @entity12 , a coroner was told			1
she is pictured with her father @entity48 ' i told them i had just performed @entity54 but they did not seem to understand why i had had to			0
' despite having told the operator on the phone that the patient was a baby , the ambulance did not seem to be properly equipped			2
' she was not treated as an emergency and no blue light was used throughout the journey even though @entity23 was still crying and grunting			1
' miss @entity16 said hospital staff were ' shouting ' at the paramedics when the ambulance arrived as they had not been told @entity23 was coming			1
@entity54 was administered as @entity23 had stopped breathing again but a cardiologist did not arrive for around 15 minutes			2
the baby 's condition stabilised and she was admitted to the intensive care ward , where she deteriorated and was given a 50 per cent chance of survival			2
' i was crying my eyes out and begged him ( a cardiologist ) to save her , ' miss @entity16 said			2
' i ran into intensive care and held @entity23 in my arms as she passed away			1
' a post-mortem examination on @entity23 concluded her death was due to congenital heart disease and @entity96			2
@entity98 dr @entity97 said the baby was born with a large hole between the right and left side of her heart and ' severe narrowing ' of blood vessels			2
@entity23 's inquest is the seventh to take place into the care of child heart patients at @entity12 ( pictured ) the inquest heard an internal report by @entity114 found ' the crew did not recognise the time critical nature of the baby and therefore conveyed the patient at normal road speed without a pre-alert to the hospital '			1
paramedic @entity123 told the hearing , in @entity125 , near @entity126 , the baby seemed ' alert ' and a normal colour when he arrived			2
' it was decided to go under normal conditions to the hospital , ' the emergency care assistant said			0
' looking back , i may have assumed it due to the fact that the baby was relatively stable and to monitor the baby in the back of the ambulance at high speed with the sirens going is difficult			0
' she was obviously poorly			0
. it was obvious we needed to go to hospital			0
she appeared pale and mottled which is a red flag			0
' mr @entity123 said he felt putting blue lights on may have reduced the four - mile journey time by ' one to two minutes '			1
the inquest heard the ambulance took 22 minutes and 19 seconds to transport @entity23 to @entity12			1
@entity149 , deputy clinical director of @entity114 , said in his opinion @entity23 suffered respiratory and not cardiac arrest at home			0
he told the inquest the journey from miss @entity16 's home to the hospital usually takes 25 minutes by car			1
' the blue lights were not on but the ambulance was not going slowly , ' he added			1
paediatric cardiologist @entity160 said she believed the baby had gastroenteritis after examining her on july 27			0
' @entity163 was happy to try @entity51 and go home if that was successful , ' she said			0
' i went over the plans with a and e staff			0
i said she could go home if she looked well and mum was happy , and if not she should be admitted			0
' miss @entity16 had to perform cpr on @entity23 while an ambulance was called , the coroner was told ms @entity160 said she received a call to attend the hospital that evening as @entity23 was in resuscitation			1
she was the first cardiologist on the scene , arriving 10 to 15 minutes later , the inquest heard			0
@entity179 , consultant in paediatric intensive care , described the resuscitation attempts to the hearing			0
' i do n't know why she died , ' dr @entity183 said			0
' i never got to the point where i could explain what had caused it			0
that 's why we gave such broad treatment			0
' dr @entity183 said she was aware of other children with @entity23 's heart defects who suddenly fatally collapsed , with experts unable to ascertain why			2
paramedic @entity194 admitted that using blue lights on the journey to hospital ' would have made a difference '			1
mr @entity194 said he arrived at @entity23 's home to find the baby ' alert and crying ' on the floor next to her mother			1
' i pointed out that she was rather floppy , mum said this was because of her @entity96 , ' he said			0
' i pointed out she was pale and mottled , mum said she was a cardiac patient and always pale and mottled			0
' mr @entity194 decided to take @entity23 to hospital but told the inquest he did not arrange how this would be done			2
' we did n't have a formal discussion of how she would be transferred to hospital and we just left , ' he said			0
' i feel i was probably a bit blinkered and i did n't raise the issue of whether we would drive with blue lights or not			2
we arrived at the hospital 22 minutes later			0
' a patient with cardiac history with a query cardiac arrest that is pale and floppy should be blue lighted to the @entity223 ' i appreciate there has been talk that blue lights would n't have made much of a difference but they would have made some difference so that should have been done			2
' mr @entity194 confirmed he has received further training since the tragedy			0
the inquest was adjourned for the day and will resume at 11am tomorrow			0
