by @entity0 published : 06:00 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 06:35 est , 30 april 2013 drunken scenes on the streets of @entity4 towns may seem like a distinctly modern phenomenon , but in fact binge - drinking has been a problem for centuries			1
a new book reveals the extraordinary drinking habits of the @entity13 period , when people drank beer for breakfast because it was thought to be healthier than water			1
alcohol abuse was so widespread that it prompted the personal intervention of @entity20 herself , who issued a ban on a super-strength drink known as ' double double beer '			1
however , this did not stop her courtiers guzzling an extraordinary amount of ale - in 1593 , the royal household got through 600,000 gallons			2
binge drinking : a scene from a @entity13 tavern , when alcohol abuse was as much of a problem as it is now smoking : the introduction of tobacco to @entity38 led some to call for a ban on smoking in alehouses the extraordinary details of how @entity4 's binge culture has a 500 - year pedigree are revealed in @entity45 , which claims to ' contain all the information a @entity13 traveller would need to negotiate a 16th - century pub crawl '			2
the average person seems to have drunk around 17 pints each week - many preferred it to water because it was less likely to carry diseases			1
in 1552 , during the short - lived reign of @entity56 , alehouses were required to have a licence for the first time , owing to ' intolerable hurts and troubles to the common wealth of this realm ' which resulted from overconsumption			2
drunkards were forced to undergo humiliating punishments such as sitting in the stocks or even wearing a hollowed - out beer barrel			1
concerns : @entity20 warned against the dangers of super-strength ' double double beer ' ale , made from malted barley and water , was the traditional @entity38 drink which had been enjoyed for centuries			1
however , after fermenting it had to be drunk quickly to stop it going off			2
beer was a more recent arrival , having been imported from the continent			1
the main difference was that it was made with hops , which allowed it to be kept for weeks rather than days			2
strong beer was , like now , popular among those who wanted to feel the effects of the alcohol quicker			1
it was given evocative nicknames such as ' mad dog ' , ' dagger ale ' and ' dragon 's milk '			2
wine from @entity38 was notorious for its poor quality , so those who could afford it drank imported wines from @entity98 and @entity99			1
it was often spiced to disguise the fact that it might have gone off			2
cider and perry were popular in the @entity104 , while the @entity105 enjoyed a dram of whisky			0
other spirits such as gin were known but were not generally drunk in @entity4			0
local officials would keep a keen eye out for signs of drunkenness - some revellers were punished just for wetting the bed , on the assumption that they must have been overindulging			0
it was not just the lowest social classes who suffered from the embarrassing fate of being placed in the stocks for excessive drinking			1
@entity123 , the future lord chancellor , was found to be drunk while he was a junior priest , and was duly punished by the sheriff - though the powerful cardinal had his revenge years later when he sentenced the same sheriff to six years in prison			0
as today , a heavy drinking culture brought a host of other problems in its wake			0
gambling was rife in @entity38 's pubs - and professional hustlers would swindle tipsy merry - makers by using loaded dice to rig the games			0
the alehouses of @entity140 were frequented by ' great swarms ' of prostitutes , according to one @entity144 visitor to the city			0
and @entity13 publicans had to wrestle with an early version of the smoking ban following the introduction of tobacco , which playwright @entity151 said was ' good for nothing but to choke a man '			0
iconic : @entity156 's @entity155 , shown being played by @entity154 , was a notorious drunkard the reputation of the @entity38 for drinking vast amounts of beer was legendary - an army commander leading his troops through @entity98 noted with astonishment that his men had ' no beer these last 10 days ' , which was ' strange for @entity38 men to do , with so little grudging '			1
the alcohol industry created a number of now obsolete jobs - such as ale - conner , a position held in @entity172 by @entity156 's father @entity173			0
the ale - conner 's job was supposedly to test the quality of beer by pouring it over a bench then sitting in it while wearing leather trousers - if the trousers stuck , the drink was off			1
the @entity156 himself was also a keen toper , according to some stories , and once took part in a drinking contest which was so onerous that he fell asleep under an apple tree			0
while beer was loved by @entity190 of all backgrounds , there was a strict social segregation when it came to drinking , with each class having its own preferred haunt			1
' taverns ' were more upmarket establishments where the middle class would enjoy bottles of wine , while poorer people were restricted to cheap ' alehouses '			0
' inns ' were similar to modern hotels			0
@entity45 , by @entity203 and @entity204 , is published by @entity205 and is out now			0
revelations : the @entity13 love of binging is detailed in a new book about drinking in the 16th century			0
