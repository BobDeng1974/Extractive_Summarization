@entity0 will be without their captain @entity1 for thursday 's @entity3 play - off at @entity5 ' @entity21 is a tough old bloke and it takes something pretty bad to sideline him or put him down but he has improved and we will put him back in when the time is right , ' said @entity0 coach @entity26			1
' we have proved that we can win without @entity1 , as good a player as he is			2
and , as much as we miss him , it 's somebody else 's opportunity			0
