by @entity0 published : 11:33 est , 12 april 2012 updated : 12:31 est , 13 april 2012 business secretary @entity1 hit out at the government ’s controversial charity tax last night saying the move could strip leading universities of millions of pounds a year in donations			1
@entity8 and @entity9 vice chancellors have privately written to @entity10 over his plan , which is attracting growing opposition from within the @entity14 cabinet			1
mr @entity1 said the proposals would have potentially serious consequences for many ‘ genuine ’ charities – a claim denied by the @entity19			1
culture secretary @entity20 is also said to be alarmed by the proposals , which have been criticised by an anti-poverty group founded by @entity23 @entity22			1
disgruntled : @entity8 and @entity9 , pictured , vice chancellors have privately written to @entity10 over his plan , which is attracting growing opposition from within the @entity14 cabinet clash : business secretary @entity1 has made it clear that he is ' sympathetic ' to concerns raised by universities that funding for scholarships and research could be affected by mr @entity10 's proposal he said he had been contacted by leading universities concerned that they could lose vital private sector cash at a time when they are facing cuts in state funding			1
he said : ‘ obviously i am 100 per cent behind efforts to crack down on abusive tax avoidance – wealthy people must pay their share			2
but we have got to separate out that issue from genuine charitable donations			2
‘ universities come within my department and they are concerned about this			1
for some universities this is a big deal because they get large sums in one - off payments from individual donors , which could be caught by this			1
‘ what is happening is that genuine charities have been caught up in something that was not intended to affect them			1
’ in a letter to mr @entity10 , @entity59 , vice-chancellor of the @entity8 , warned the tax " risks undermining the culture " of university philanthropy , according to @entity60			1
a university spokesman said : " the generosity of @entity8 's donors provides huge public benefit , contributing to teaching , research and student bursaries			2
sir @entity74 , vice-chancellor of the @entity9 has also written a private letter to mr @entity10 expressing his concern , the paper said			1
chancellor @entity10 ’s decision to cap tax relief for charitable giving has provoked a storm of protest from charities			1
@entity83 , executive director of @entity84 in the @entity85 , warned the move would have dire consequences for the poor			0
he said : ‘ the poorest and most vulnerable children will pay the price , and they could pay the price with their lives			0
’ @entity93 warned at least £ 80million in regular donations to its organisations was at risk , while a new £ 55million ‘ matched funding ’ scheme with the @entity98 could also be in jeopardy			1
faith - based charities also criticised the move			1
in an open letter , @entity103 , the @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 warned the ‘ misguided ’ proposal would have a serious impact on their activities			0
concerns : @entity93 chair dame @entity113 said donations to arts organisations were likely to suffer , while culture secretary @entity20 , right , is said to be worried by the proposals they said : ‘ we ask the government urgently to reconsider this proposal so that it tackles any potential abuse , but protects the life - saving philanthropy @entity123 has rightly praised in the past			1
’ mr @entity1 ’s intervention sparked fury at the @entity19 , where sources pointed out that the cap had been introduced partly to help pay for @entity130 demands to raise the income tax threshold to £ 9,200			1
a source said : ‘ @entity1 ’s position seems to be a bit confused			0
he is setting himself against a policy that is designed to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share of tax and that helps cut tax for people on lower and middle incomes – a policy that @entity143 has made a big priority			0
’ yesterday , as it emerged that independent schools could also be hit by the proposals , universities said mr @entity1 was right to raise concerns			1
dr @entity149 , director - general of the @entity150 of 20 leading universities , said : ‘ our institutions are increasingly reliant on charitable giving as we strive to remain world - class			1
anything that could reduce philanthropic donations would be of huge concern to us and we urge the government to clarify the implications of this announcement			0
’ treasury sources also revealed that the controversial plan might raise as little as £ 60million a year – of which only a fraction relates to abuse of the rules			1
sources in the charitable sector suggested this would equate to losses of about £ 300million a year for good causes			1
the new proposals would cap the amount an individual can give to charity before incurring tax at £ 50,000 a year or a quarter of their total income , whichever is higher			1
ministers claim the scheme remains ‘ generous ’ and will prevent abuse by individuals who give money to questionable charities , often abroad , in order to avoid tax			1
treasury chief secretary @entity186 said the policy had been ‘ set out for extremely good reasons ’			1
he acknowledged there had been ‘ controversy ’ about the proposal , but said ministers would work with charities and philanthropists ‘ to ensure the removal of the tax relief does not have a significant impact on charities which depend on large donations ’			1
on wednesday mr @entity123 indicated that ministers were considering a partial climbdown in order to limit the damage to charities			2
but yesterday it remained unclear what form this would take			0
former @entity14 leadership candidate @entity208 last night said the problem could be fixed without imposing a damaging cap as most of the alleged abuse was already against the law			0
he said : ‘ the abuse being talked about is not tax avoidance , it is concealed tax evasion			0
we do not need any new laws , we need better enforcement			0
they are using a sledgehammer to crack a nut			0
’ @entity221 accused ministers of presiding over a shambles and said the chancellor appeared to be ‘ increasingly isolated ’			0
the @entity19 yesterday refused for a third day running to reveal how many tycoons it believes are abusing the rules on charitable donations to dodge tax			0
a reliable source told the @entity231 that the heavy - handed clampdown on charitable giving was prompted by concerns about the tax affairs of just seven wealthy individuals and their families			2
the @entity19 took four hours to respond to the claim yesterday before indicating the true level of abuse was higher			0
but a spokesman refused to say how many people ministers believe are bending or breaking the rules			0
and he muddied the waters by saying the policy was not just about tackling abuse , but about ensuring all individuals pay a minimum level of tax			0
the @entity19 would not comment on why it was being so secretive about the scale of a supposed loophole it has already announced it is closing			0
the spokesman said : ‘ this is not just about a handful of people – there is a lot of it going on			0
but this is not just about the abuse – there is also a broader principle of people paying a certain level of tax			0
’ the @entity19 claims that the controversial cap on tax relief for charitable donations is essential in stamping out tax - dodging			0
sources claim some wealthy individuals channel vast sums into charitable trusts with the benefit of tax relief before moving the funds to a charity abroad and withdrawing the cash once it is away from the eyes of @entity85 authorities			0
another scam involves channelling money into charitable trusts that give only a small amount to genuine charities			2
the rest of the cash is lent to the donor ’s companies or spent on lavish parties dressed up as charitable fundraising events			0
critics , including the influential @entity14 backbencher @entity208 , point out that both scams are already illegal and could be tackled by better enforcement of the existing laws rather than a draconian cap that risks damaging genuine charities			2
the @entity19 ’s own figures suggest the amount of abuse involved is relatively small			0
budget figures state that capping a series of tax reliefs will generate about £ 300million for the taxpayer			2
but the @entity19 acknowledged yesterday that as little as £ 60million of this relates to charitable giving			2
but the impact on the charitable sector could be more than £ 300million a year			2
according to the @entity19 the top 20 individuals affected by the changes reduced their tax bills by £ 145million last year by using various uncapped tax reliefs			2
but almost two - thirds of this related to tax relief on business losses			2
only 20 per cent involved tax relief on charitable giving .			0
