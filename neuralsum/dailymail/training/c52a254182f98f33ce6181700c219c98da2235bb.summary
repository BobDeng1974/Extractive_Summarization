but @entity5 's dancing days are over , the last guests have long since checked out , and the resort has been left to rot for 27 years			1
the 1,200 - acre @entity8 resort was abandoned in 1986 - the year before the hit film , starring @entity10 and @entity11 as a dance instructor and @entity13 , a holidaying teenager at the fictional @entity14 's , was released			1
the hotel and grounds were part of the @entity18 , an area of @entity20 that was popular with holidaying @entity22 families who faced discrimination elsewhere before cheap air travel meant trips abroad took off			1
the likes of @entity27 and @entity28 stayed at the glamorous resort in its 1960s and 70s heyday			0
now @entity5 's has descended into decay , with deckchairs , beds and salon hairdryers still standing			2
a deckchair in the abandoned @entity38 hotel is now surrounded by foliage and moss , having been left untouched since 1986 two fold - down beds and a framed painting remain in this guest room even though moss has taken over the floor and the ceiling is bare a beauty salon lies derelict with the tall hairdryer still standing			0
it looks like the salon was inspired by @entity53 artist @entity52 's composition paintings from the wall tiles that remain the deserted lobby has since been used for graffiti while the walls have been left to rot the hotel began as a small guesthouse with no plumbing or electricity in the 1900s , reports @entity63			0
@entity66 immigrants @entity5 and wife @entity64 moved to the @entity8 from @entity67 , and @entity64 's incredible kosher cooking and their renowned hospitality meant they soon needed to expand			1
in 1919 , they bought a bigger house - @entity5 's @entity71 - sat within 100 acres			2
the @entity74 ' daughter @entity73 was the resort 's hostess and by the time of her death in 1972 , she had transformed it into 35 buildings attracting 150,000 guests a year			1
@entity5 's was famed for being the first place to use artificial snow for skiers in 1952			0
it had its own airstrip , ballrooms , auditoriums and sports grounds , hosting comedians and sporting champions and putting on nightly entertainment			0
its golf course remains open next to the abandoned site			0
@entity94 bought the resort in 1985 but could not reverse its fortunes when it came to declining visitor numbers who had given up the 100 - mile journey to the @entity8 from @entity67 in favor of air travel			2
now , the moss - covered walls and floors have become spots for graffiti and exploration as the overgrown shell of @entity5 's remains			2
a summer at @entity5 's , a family destination popular with @entity22 holidaymakers , was believed to have inspired @entity2			1
the film starred @entity10 as a dance instructor at the fictional @entity14 's resort , with @entity11 as @entity13 , a teenager who finds love and learns to dance during a long family holiday the route to the resort 's indoor swimming pool			0
guest could also swim in the @entity121 - size outdoor pool an office at the @entity38 hotel , named after the @entity5 's daughter who transformed the resort into a success mold and moss has replaced the comfortable fittings and furniture of guest bedrooms at the site , which has been left alone for 27 years @entity94 bought the 1,200 - acre site in 1985 but failed to lure visitors back to the @entity8 and closed @entity5 's a year later the outside is growing into the @entity8 resort , which once hosted the likes of @entity27 and @entity28 despite its dilapidated state , the hotel is still standing next to its golf course , which remains open @entity5 's , like the fictional @entity14 's resort in @entity2 , pictured , hosted entertainment in its own ballrooms and auditoriums			1

the 1,200 - acre resort was part of @entity20 's @entity18 , which was popular with @entity22 families in summer
@entity66 immigrants @entity5 and wife @entity64 move from @entity67 to start their *business* in the 1900s
their daughter @entity73 transformed it into a site attracting 150,000 guests a year , who stayed in their 35 buildings
