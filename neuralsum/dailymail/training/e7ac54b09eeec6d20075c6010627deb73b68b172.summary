it turned out that all we were ever going to discover in @entity2 is who might be the better of two moderate @entity5 teams			0
@entity6 almost claimed that modest accolade with a second - half performance born of desperation			1
then that porous left side of their defence leaked yet again and the impossible comeback of @entity14 materialised into all too complete a resurrection			0
yet it seems inconceivable that the winners of a tournament bursting at the seams with brilliant goals and dazzling football might come out of a match like this			0
like @entity30 starting like a broken down old van at @entity32 ' 82 and roaring through the finishing line like a @entity34			1
but while champions do tend to grow the longer they last during a @entity5 , they do n't usually begin as short of stature as @entity6 or @entity27			1
despite this result it still remains unclear whether either of them will make it as far as the last 16			0
@entity42 chose to shuffle the pack rather than change any cards			1
clinical : @entity27 striker @entity14 heads past @entity6 keeper @entity46 that left us to work out whether the manager , along with most of the nation , had been reading too many positives into a losing performance			1
maybe so , because we still do n't really know how good are @entity30			1
and with that wonderful gift of hind - sight i have to say they did not appear as potent as the @entity30 counter-attackers of @entity59 past			1
but for sure @entity27 were hopeless against @entity60			0
without @entity14 they were not a patch on the other @entity62			0
with him , they gave @entity46 some collywobbles in @entity6 's goal			1
thanks to the miracle of the wounded knee he gave them the lead tormentor : @entity14 celebrates scoring for of @entity27 against @entity6 in @entity2 finally , unbelievably , he scored their winner			2
how long and how far he might carry @entity27 on one - and - a - half legs is another matter entirely			0
the comparison with @entity77 was close to becoming embarrassing for two thirds of the night			0
the awkward question of how soon , if ever , @entity77 might score his first @entity5 finals goal remained unanswered with more than another hour of endeavour elapsed			0
so close : @entity77 shot straight at the goalkeeper when he found space in the penalty area @entity42 had given him his rightful place in the middle , albeit without improving the balance in midfield			2
but it all seemed worth it when that tap - in came			0
just 24 hours earlier @entity98 had paid the penalty for excessive loyalty to his preferred players			1
there is an element of that now for @entity42			2
but the difference here of course is that @entity6 , as they try to build for a better future while still trying to put on a good show in this @entity5 , do not yet possess @entity32 's strength in squad depth			1
how did he miss ? @entity77 powers his header against the bar from point - blank range tussle : @entity6 's @entity118 challenges @entity119 of @entity27 was @entity120 as much of an improvement on @entity122 as @entity123 might be ? would @entity124 be better than @entity125 ? and most citically and contentiously of all , if age is catching up with the captain , has the time come for @entity118 to hand over the flag of experience to @entity124 ? after this deathly struggle , we might as well find out against @entity60			2
after all , what more do @entity42 â€™s boys have to lose ? only another football match .			2

@entity42 had chosen to shuffle the pack rather than change any cards after @entity30 defeat
@entity6 were caught with one eye on the future while also trying to put on a show in @entity144
@entity32 had paid the price for excessive loyalty and the same could be said with @entity42
