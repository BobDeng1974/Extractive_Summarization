by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 02:40 est , 19 february 2013 updated : 04:05 est , 19 february 2013 the meteor that exploded over @entity5 's @entity4 last week is the biggest space rock to have hit earth in more than a century , scientists have claimed			1
the 100,000 tonne rock , measuring around 55 feet in diameter , created a huge hole in a frozen lake when it crashed into the ground			1
scientists have found more than 50 tiny fragments of the meteor , allowing them to uncover information about its contents			1
as they search for their own pieces of the meteor , rocks have already been put on the internet for sale , and police are warning all purchasers to prepare for possible fraud			2
the meteor injured nearly 1,500 people and caused widespread property damage in @entity63 on friday , with health officials saying that 46 of the injured remain hospitalised			2
the debris narrowly missed a direct and devastating hit on the industrial city which has a population of 1.13 million but spread panic through its streets as the sky above lit up with a blinding flash			0
lab tests : service pieces of a meteorite are displayed in a laboratory in @entity77 after being recovered from near @entity78 in the @entity79			0
a total of 53 pieces have been brought for analysis to the university in @entity77 @entity84 of @entity86 's @entity85 said : ' we would expect an event of this magnitude to occur once every 100 years			2
' he told the @entity91 : ' when you have a fireball of this size we would expect a large number of meteorites to reach the surface and in this case there were probably some large ones			0
' @entity28 , who led the expedition from @entity30 , said that 53 fragments of the meteor have been plucked from the ice - covered @entity33			1
he said they are less than a centimeter ( half an inch ) in size , about 10 per cent iron , and belong to the chondrite type , the most common variation of meteorites found on @entity112			0
divers inspecting the lake have found nothing at the bottom , but mr @entity28 said a fragment as large as 50 - 60 centimeters ( 20 - 24 inches ) could eventually be found there			1
worth up to £ 6,500 : these tiny fragments are said to be valuable and some are already being auctioned online after they were found near @entity78 in the @entity25 region of @entity5 terrifying : almost 1,200 people were injured when the meteor burst through the @entity112 's atmosphere at a speed of 46,000mph on friday , blowing out the windows of 900 schools and hospitals and damaging around 100,000 homes workers in the city remained busy replacing acres of windows shattered by a powerful shockwave caused by the meteor 's strike , which @entity86 said released 500 kilotons of energy , the power equivalent to more than 30 @entity140 bombs			1
the local governor estimated the damage at 1 billion rubles ( £ 21.5million ) and said he hopes the federal government will provide at least half that amount			0
@entity145 , head of the astronomy department at the @entity148 - based @entity147 , said experts have drafted a program that envisages building powerful telescopes , including space - based ones , to warn against potentially dangerous asteroids , comets and other threats			2
fragments have started to appear on @entity157 , a @entity5 website for classified ads. many pieces were harvested around @entity25 , where more than 1,000 were injured as the meteor disintegrated overhead			1
flash of light : the debris narrowly missed a direct and devastating hit on the industrial city which has a population of 1.13 million but spread panic through its streets as the sky above lit up with a blinding flash one user asked for around £ 6,500 for a small piece , while another offered 18 pieces for £ 11 each			0
residents of a village near @entity25 searched the snowy streets , collecting stones they hoped would prove to be the real thing			1
but not all were ready to sell			0
' i will keep it			0
why sell it ? i did n't have a rich lifestyle before , so why start now ? ' a woman in a pink woollen hat and winter jacket , clutching a small black pebble , told state television @entity191 - 24			2
on saturday , divers searched the waters beneath the ice for traces of space rock but surfaced empty handed , leaving some experts questioning whether the hole was indeed formed by a piece of falling debris			1
' @entity201 ' : experts said asteroid 2012 @entity203 should drive nations to work together to create a warning system if an early warning system existed countries could prepare for the destruction caused by asteroid debris as it raced through the sky , the 50 - foot wide chunk of space rock compressed the air ahead of it , creating the enormous temperatures that meant it exploded in a fireball somewhere between 18 and 32 miles above the ground at around 9.20am local time on friday			1
although some debris fell to earth , ‘ whipping up a pillar of ice , water and steam ’ and creating a 20 - foot - wide crater , the damage in nearby towns was actually caused by shockwaves created by the meteor breaking the sound barrier and then exploding			1
collectors from around the world will be keen to get hold of a piece			0
film director @entity235 is a noted collector			0
in october a 9in piece of the @entity238 meteorite found in @entity239 in 1960 sold in @entity240 for $ 43,750 ( £ 28,200 )			0
astronomers have also revealed that the meteor could have hit @entity244 cities if it had hit at a slightly different time of day			0
shattered : the city of @entity25 , 900 miles east of @entity148 and close to the @entity248 border , took the brunt of the impact local residents said they witnessed burning objects in the sky of the @entity25 and @entity77 regions			2

experts say the meteor weighed 100,000 tonnes and was 55 feet wide
the rock created a 50 - foot hole in a frozen lake near @entity25
scientists say they have located 53 tiny fragments of the meteor
