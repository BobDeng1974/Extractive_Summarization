@entity1 's personal doctor has revealed he can not be sure that boxing contributed to the former heavyweight world champion 's @entity3			1
@entity1 , considered by many to be the greatest boxer of all time , has suffered with the neurological syndrome since the mid- 1980s and it has often been presumed that blows to the head during his 21 - year professional career were a contributing factor to his condition			1
but dr @entity15 , who is the medical director of the @entity17 , admits that it is not possible to be entirely sure what caused @entity1 to suffer from @entity3 's			1
former heavyweight champion @entity1 has had @entity3 since 1980s ' it 's only over the last 10 years that he 's had a lot of trouble walking , with falls , ' he told @entity26 's @entity25 programme			1
' so his course has been more that of typical @entity3			2
if you look at the mri of his brain it looks pretty good but it 's very difficult to factor in what sort of role did boxing play			0
' people ask me about this and i tell them : look at @entity39			0
he boxed longer than @entity1 did , took many more blows to the head and he 's on television selling his cookware			2
' i think that he ( @entity1 ) has typical @entity3			1
did the boxing contribute ? i do n't know			0
' @entity1 's personal doctor said that @entity39 received many more blows to the head and is now fine dr @entity15 gave the impression of a happy retirement for @entity1 - who was known as @entity1 before joining the @entity53 and changing his name - and stressed that , despite some reports , there is no reason to fear for his health			1
he said : ' he 's had @entity3 's since about 1984 , that 's almost 30 years , that 's a long time in @entity3 's			2
' he 's in good spirits , he has some trouble walking but overall for having had @entity3 's for 30 years , he 's doing okay			2
' he added : ' @entity1 is now 72 so you can have a heart attack or you can have a stroke			0
@entity1 , seen here in @entity67 , is in good condition considering he 's had @entity3 's for 30 years , says his doctor ' i do n't know that he 's more or less at risk than anyone else but anything can happen to you			1
' how do people with @entity3 die ? they do n't die of @entity3 , they develop trouble swallowing and they develop pneumonia and he does n't have trouble swallowing			0
' they fall , they bang their head - his family takes extraordinary care of him			0
' i could have a heart attack or a stroke and die but i do n't see anything immediately that leads me to think he 's gong to die in six months or die in a year			0
i ca n't say that			0
