terror alert : specialist bomb squad officers were called and hospitals placed on alert after a package sent to the @entity1 's @entity4 headquarters was mistaken for a bomb scene of panic : the @entity1 's @entity12 development in @entity4 the package was sent by a @entity31 - based journalist , who works for the @entity1 's flagship current affairs show , @entity1 , to a colleague at @entity34			1
it comprised a tiny recording device inside a plastic bottle of drink , which looked exactly like a bomb when x-rayed			1
however , shortly before bomb squad officers were due to carry out a controlled explosion , @entity40 said a senior employee phoned them and claimed it was part of a ' security test ' being carried out by @entity1 journalists			1
but in a later call , the employee claimed the package was a ' bug ' that should have been sent in the @entity1 's internal post			1
a @entity1 spokesman denied the package was sent as a ' security test ' and said : ' the package contained filming equipment and had been sent from @entity57 by @entity58 because it was needed in @entity4 the following day			1
' this was categorically not part of an investigation testing security procedures			2
' there was a stamp on the outside of the package that showed it had been sent by @entity57 and it was addressed to a producer at @entity68			0
' the package was referred to the police , as it was believed it looked suspicious			2
' everyone acted in good faith and we discussed what happened in detail with the police yesterday			0
' the incident has infuriated police commissioner @entity78 , who has now vowed to send the force ’s £ 5,000 policing bill to the @entity1 director general , @entity81			1
he also labelled the blunder an ‘ irresponsible ’ diversion of resources			0
bomb detectives were called to @entity86 on @entity87 , near the @entity1 studios , shortly after 9am on wednesday after security staff raised the alarm			2
they were joined by five specialist hazard response teams from the @entity92 - trained to deal with major incidents - at a further cost of between £ 3,000 to £ 4,000			0
in addition , fire crews , including three pumps , two station managers and a specialist support unit were also put on standby , costing about £ 5,300			0
furious : police commissioner @entity78 ( left ) has vowed to send the bill to @entity1 director general @entity81 initially , explosives experts concluded the package was either an ‘ elaborate hoax ’ or a real bomb - until the @entity1 revealed it was actually a home - made ‘ bug ’			1
a police source said : ' the package was sent from @entity31 and when it was put through the x-ray at the sorting office , it immediately aroused suspicion , because there was a device in a plastic bottle which had had all hallmarks of an @entity116 ( @entity116 )			1
' it was initially treated as a serious threat or a hoax , so all the usual protocols were followed			0
' shortly after the alarm was raised , a senior @entity1 employee rang to say to it was a security test being carried out by @entity1 journalists			1
' but then the employee claimed it was all a terrible misunderstanding and the package should have been sent in the @entity1 's internal post			2
' mr @entity78 has now called for a full internal inquiry			0
it is understood police interviewed several @entity1 employees after the incident , and concluded no criminal activity had taken place			2
call for inquiry : @entity136 , the @entity1 's director of news , will be asked to investigate @entity1 's involvement in the blunder mr @entity78 said : ' whatever has happened here , whether a deliberate hoax or a stupid mistake , it caused severe disruption to the emergency services and the local community in @entity4			0
' the cost of this operation to the police alone is likely to be around about £ 5,000 and i will be sending the bill to the @entity1 ’s director general			2
' it ’s not right that the people of @entity154 should have to pick up the tab for @entity1 ’s stupidity			0
' i will also be writing to @entity136 , the new director of news at the corporation , as i expect him to carry out a full review of the circumstances			0
' the @entity1 owes it to the people of @entity154 to explain how @entity1 caused this farce to happen , and what they will do to avoid a repeat of it			0
