beware the hotel front desk			1
not only do they hold the key to your room , they also hold the key to the difference between an average or a premier stay			2
knowing how to ask staff for things , how much to tip , how to book , when to push your cause and when definitely not to can transform the service you receive			0
@entity15 of the hotel industry @entity14 and author of @entity18 : a @entity19 started life as a valet in @entity22 more than a decade ago and rose through the ranks to land a front desk job in @entity25			1
here , we run through some of his best revelations			0
) @entity40 make a packet on room rates according to @entity14 , the average cost to turn over a room and keep it sleep - worthy is just £ 25 ( $ 40 )			1
that covers everything from washing sheets to electricity , hourly wages for housekeepers , minibar attendants , front desk agents and cleaning supplies			1
in other words , the whole shebang			0
' the fact that a hotel could fail to be profitable astounds me , ' says @entity14			2
given that the average price of a four star hotel in @entity62 is about £ 140 , they should be raking it in			2
stay somewhere that costs much less than £ 25 a night and you 'll know some serious corners are being cut			1
the average cost to keep a room operational is £ 25 ( $ 40 ) so anything that costs less than that you should avoid 2			1
) never pay for the mini bar @entity72 bars sit in every hotel room begging you to spend money			1
amazingly , @entity14 says you can almost always wriggle out of paying for them			0
according to him , the process for applying a mini bar bill is always horribly inexact and anything from keystroke errors , delays in restocking , double stocking and many other mishaps can cause miscalculations			1
people at the front desks do n't want an argument			0
@entity14 says , ' even before guests can manage to get through half of the ' i never had those items ' sentence , i have already removed the charges and am now simply waiting for them to wrap up the overly zealous denial so we can both move on with our lives			2
' happy hour : employees hate haggling with guests over the bar bill as all too often processing issues can occur 3			0
) phrase it right getting the front desk to take your latest gripe seriously can be tricky			1
' though most complaints should be delivered to the front desk directly , in person or on the phone , keep in mind that most issues will not have been caused by the front desk at all			1
so briefly outline your problem , offer a solution if you have one , and then ask whom you should speak with to have the problem solved			0
' should i speak to a manager about this ? ' ' should i speak to housekeeping about this ? ' those are wonderful and beautiful questions to ask			0
' make it personal : asking for the person 's name who is dealing with your complaint will get it fixed faster best of all ? ask for the employees name as nothing concentrates the mind better than knowing you can identify them later if everything is not resolved			0
) do n't book on discount sites and expect the world it 's obvious but if you want the best room you have to fork out for it			1
hotels give those who book through last minute discounts sites such as @entity28 the worst , smallest dingiest rooms			0
they know you 've come to them because of a one - off deal - rather than through their own website - and most likely wo n't be a repeat visitor			0
it 's obvious , but if you want the best room you have to fork out for it			0
discount sites get given smallest rooms @entity158 explains , ' first of all , we earn the slimmest profit from these reservations ... [ secondly ] since we have no reason to assume @entity164 guests will ever book with us again , unless our discount is presented to them , it truly makes business sense to save our best rooms for guests who book of their own volition			1
) tip like your life depends on it every front desk wields a certain amount of power when it comes to awarding a guest a better time , and they 're almost always authorised to upgrade for special occasions			1
money talks : according to @entity14 , all you need is £ 12 ( $ 20 ) tip to ensure the front desk is in your pocket birthday or anniversary ? almost every front desk employee has the ability to upgrade for special occasions there 's always a room with a bigger tv screen , a room that , according to the building 's layout , has a larger bath and two sinks or a room that although listed as standard has a great view			1
all it takes ? a decent tip. ' when i feel that $ 20 ( £ 12 ) you slipped me burning in my pocket , i will find [ that upgrade ] for you			0
and if there is nothing to be done room-wise , i have a slew of other options : late checkout , free movies , free minibar , room service amenities , and more			0
i will do whatever it takes to deserve the tip and then a little bit more in the hope that you ’ll hit me again			0
' play nice : to ensure you 're not first on the list to get pushed from an overbooked hotel do n't be rude to staff 6			2
) do n't be shafted like airlines , hotels overbook rooms to compensate when people do n't show up			0
most guests still have to pay at least a 10 per cent charge for a no - show , so if the hotel fills the room on top of that they 're laughing			2
if you 're unlucky and everyone shows up the front desk will have to send some people packing or put them up for a night elsewhere			1
to ensure it 's not you @entity14 suggests ( if you can ) not using a discount site when booking , being a repeat customer , booking in for more than one night and not being rude or obnoxious to staff .			2

front desk employee @entity14 spills beans on industry
average hotel room costs just £ 25 a day to stay operational
staff do n't want a fight so will back down over mini bar ' *discrepancies* '
the front desk is authorised to upgrade guests on special occasions
you 'll get the worst room in the house if you booked through discount sites
