by @entity0 published : 04:24 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 05:29 est , 9 april 2013 @entity2 monarch butterflies migrate across the continent without an internal map , according to new research			1
the butterflies travel from @entity7 and the @entity8 to @entity9 using basic orientation techniques and landmarks to find their way - as opposed to the internal maps they were previously though to use			1
researchers from the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity7 , believe that the insects also use an ‘ internal compass ’ which enables them to navigate to their wintering sites using the position of the sun and the @entity25 ’s magnetic field			1
@entity2 monarch butterflies migrate across the continent without the internal map they were previously though to have the butterflies are found in @entity2 , @entity28 , @entity29 and parts of @entity31			1
they have a wingspan of 8.9 to 10.2cm and are famous for their migration from @entity7 and the @entity8 to @entity9 and then back			0
they start their southward migration with the first frost and then return in spring			0
the length of the journey exceeds the lifespan of most butterflies - which is less than two months - so a full migration cycle involves a number of generations			2
they migrate south because they can not withstand freezing temperatures and they return north because the larval food plants they need do not grow in their overwintering sites			1
the team analysed more than 50 years ' worth of migration data in an attempt to learn how monarchs find their way to their wintering habitat in @entity9 – a journey they make just part of during their lifetime			2
they discovered that when the butterflies are blown off course , they most likely use major geographic landmarks to help them get back on track			1
the researchers believe that this is necessary as the butterflies can not detect longitudinal displacements so would otherwise get lost on the journey			2
to test whether monarchs could detect longitude displacements , the team , led by undergraduate student @entity74 , examined the butterflies ' flight patterns in a funnel on the @entity17 campus			0
they then tested the same monarchs in @entity83			0
‘ the monarchs we tested in @entity17 flew southwest , in the general direction of @entity9 , ’ said ms @entity74			0
‘ when we tested them in @entity83 , they flew in the same general direction as if they were in @entity18 , suggesting that they did not know they had been displaced 2,500 kilometres			0
’ the team also studied data from monarchs tagged and recaptured throughout @entity2 from 1952 to 2004 , and found that migrating monarchs do not use an internal map to reach @entity9			1
the butterflies travel from @entity7 and the @entity8 to @entity9 using basic orientation techniques and landmarks to find their way to discovered whether monarchs can detect longitude displacements the team examined their flight patterns in a funnel ( pictured ) instead , they use landmarks , such as coastlines and the @entity107 and @entity108			1
‘ given the challenge of this migratory journey and the fact that these insects are less than a gram , it is a remarkably simple system they used to travel thousands of kilometres to a site they have never seen , ’ said professor @entity109			0
despite the new findings , one question remains unanswered – monarch butterflies use the same sites in the highlands of central @entity9 each year but no one knows exactly how they pinpoint these exact locations			2
ms @entity74 said : ‘ one possibility we think is likely , and would need to be tested , is that they - like some other migratory animals - use smell to guide them to their final destination			0

the butterflies migrate without the internal map *people* thought they had
use position of the sun and @entity25 *'s* magnetic field to find wintering sites
use landmarks such as the @entity142 if they get blown off course
