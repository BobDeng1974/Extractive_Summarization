thousands of bladder cancer patients face an uncertain future because stocks of a drug that prevents the disease progressing are running perilously low			1
the crisis means patients may be soon given a stark choice : surgical removal of the entire organ , or risk the cancer returning			1
up to 12,000 people are to be left without the crucial medication , called @entity13 , as @entity15 hospitals run out of supplies			1
one sufferer , @entity17 , 48 , who was diagnosed with bladder cancer six months ago , said his treatment with @entity13 had been ‘ postponed indefinitely ’ because of the shortage			1
recovery : model @entity23 , with husband @entity25 , who was diagnosed with the disease in 2007 the marketing manager from @entity28 , @entity29 , said : ‘ when you ’re put on a cancer treatment plan you do n’t want to change anything in case your cancer returns			1
‘ so when you ’re told you ca n’t have the treatment you were promised , it ’s very worrying			2
my hospital told me they ca n’t get any @entity13 supplies , regardless of the quantity			2
‘ i ’ve been told that i ’ll be monitored closely and any tumours that develop will be “ whipped out ” but obviously that ’s not ideal – you do n’t want tumours returning at all			2
‘ i know people are being diagnosed with the same level of cancer i had and have been offered bladder removal as an alternative because of the shortage			1
’ @entity13 is a modified , safe form of the bacteria @entity13 that stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies to tuberculosis			1
the drug is usually thought of as a vaccine given to children to protect against @entity56 , yet it is also a key treatment for one of the most aggressive forms of bladder cancer			1
a different strain is given to cancer patients , and in these cases the antibodies have been found to target tumour cells			2
bladder cancer is the second most frequently occurring disease of the urinary system after prostate			2
it is also the fourth most common cancer in men and the tenth in women in the @entity15 , with more than 10,000 cases a year , and 5,000 deaths			0
the most high - profile patient in recent years is dame @entity79 , 70 , the wife of author and politician @entity80			0
she was diagnosed with the disease in 2010 and underwent @entity13 treatment to try to halt the cancer ’s progression before having her bladder removed			1
the most high - profile patient in recent years is dame @entity79 , 70 , the wife of author and politician @entity80 , who was diagnosed with the disease in 2010 @entity23 , 58 , the model and actress wife of @entity91 guitarist @entity25 , also suffered bladder cancer in 2007			2
she has since made a full recovery			0
the shortage of the drug is the second such occurrence in two years			2
a flood at a factory owned by pharmaceutical company @entity99 , which manufactures @entity13 , led to supply problems in 2012			2
this left production limited to rival company @entity103 , but it is now struggling to cope with increased global demand			0
some doctors have advised patients to have their bladder removed completely because it is not known when stocks of the drug will be replenished			1
bladder cancer has one of the highest recurrence rates of any type of cancer , and @entity13 is the only drug used to protect against it			1
@entity13 is piped into the bladder via a catheter			2
it is given to patients with an aggressive form of bladder cancer which has not yet penetrated the bladder wall , following surgery to remove tumours			0
the @entity126 ( @entity126 ) is now calling on officials at @entity128 and the drugs regulator to fast - track the licensing of other @entity13 strains from abroad in order to boost the @entity15 ’s supply and protect patients			1
@entity135 , pictured running the @entity137 relay race in @entity138 in 2012 unlicensed @entity13 strains can be imported and used with the patients ’ consent , but it is up to individual hospitals to decide whether this is a route they want to take			1
urologist @entity146 , president of @entity126 , said : ‘ there is an @entity149 product out there and that is where the government could make a difference			0
‘ we have appropriately strict licensing regulations in this country but the government could make it easier by expediting the approval of some of these other strains			0
at the moment , one or two hospitals are ordering these strains anyway , but at their own risk			0
‘ patients are rightly worried about what ’s going on and although there are no scare stories yet about things going badly wrong without @entity13 , the longer this shortage goes on the greater the risk there will be			1
’ last month , @entity174 health spokeswoman @entity173 asked @entity176 officials what it was doing to address the shortage			0
in reply , life sciences minister @entity180 said the government did not know how many patients were affected but officials were monitoring the situation and were ‘ in close contact with @entity126 ’			1
but mr @entity146 said this was not the case			0
‘ at what level they ’re in contact with us is slightly passing me by at the moment , ’ he said			0
@entity103 issued a warning earlier this year that it expected there to be a shortage of @entity13 for a couple of months , but this has now been extended and is expected to last well into 2015			1
@entity199 , founder of the charity @entity200 , said : ‘ treatments for bladder cancer have n’t changed for over 35 years because so little research is done in this area			0
@entity13 is one of the few treatments available			0
‘ two years ago when a shortage happened , the government should have set up a system whereby we could import supplies , if only temporarily			0
demand is growing every year and this problem is a combination of bad planning and bad luck			0
’ a spokesman for @entity103 said : ‘ we are doing everything we can to meet this demand and have increased production by 100 per cent over the past two years			0
‘ but given that we are the only source of @entity13 in the @entity15 and many other countries , and that @entity13 requires stringent and rigorous quality testing to ensure high - quality product for patients , fully meeting @entity15 demand will take some time			1
quantities may remain limited throughout 2014 and 2015 while we work hard to meet this demand			0
’ the @entity228 said it would consider fast - tracking licensing applications in the event of a shortfall of medicines			0
a spokesman added : ‘ we are providing advice on the requirements for obtaining a licence to manufacturers of @entity13 products who do not currently have licences for their products in the @entity15 , and for importing medicines into the @entity15			1
