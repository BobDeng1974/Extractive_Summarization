by @entity0 published : 16:31 est , 6 august 2012 updated : 03:32 est , 7 august 2012 as he stepped onto the podium the emotion finally got the better of him			2
@entity4 , who had just won gold in the @entity7 400m hurdles for the second time , sobbed throughout his country 's national anthem , unable to restrain the flow of tears			1
but this was not just an athlete overcome with joy at the fulfillment of an @entity7 dream - it was the end of a tough four - year journey that began the day he failed to even make the final at @entity22			1
there his hopes of defending the title he had won in @entity25 took a massive blow when news of the death of his grandmother reached him on the day of his heat			1
overcome : the hurdler struggled to control his tears as his national anthem played after he was awarded the gold medal ' i got news on the morning of the first round in @entity22 that she had died , ' he explained			1
i cried the whole day			1
' i ran but i ran badly and i made a promise that day that i would win a medal for her			1
it took me four years			2
' and he did it in style , winning the race in 47.63 seconds - the exact same time he ran when taking the title in @entity25 eight years ago			1
and as light rain fell last night as he waited to receive his second @entity7 gold , @entity4 said he had felt his grandmother @entity54 was there with him in the stadium			1
' it started to rain			2
it made me feel like she was crying tears of joy with me , ' @entity4 , little over three weeks away from his 35th birthday , told a news conference			1
' i 've been emotional all week , thinking about her , thinking if i could win			2
' a giant screen at the stadium displays a picture of @entity4 in tears as the @entity70 burns the occasion all got too much for @entity4 as he was awarded his medal , eight years after taking the gold in @entity25 emotional : gold medallist @entity4 sobbed uncontrollably after winning the 400 metres hurdles @entity4 had pinned a picture of his grandmother behind his race bib and ran with her name on his spikes			1
' we got here and i pinned her picture under my bib so she could run close to my heart			2
i wrote her name - at least what i called her in @entity89 - on my spikes			2
' just as a motivator and just as a reminder of how special she was to and how much this @entity94 meant to me being how old i was			2
' unsurprisingly his blubbing performance on the podium did not go unnoticed on @entity98			1
@entity99 , wife of the commons speaker @entity100 , tweeted : ' loved @entity4 sobbing as he got @entity101			1
it means a lot to him & he 's not ashamed to show it : ) ' @entity107 rowing hero @entity106 , who won gold at four olympics , posted : ' one chance , one day			1
@entity112 life changing if you do it once never mind twice			2
' @entity4 's tears reminded viewers of some of @entity119 's very own @entity7 champions , whose reactions to clinching gold earlier this week won fans ' hearts			1
since 2004 , @entity4 - who had dominated the event in the three years up to @entity25 - has had his career hit by injury			1
but he said he never lost hope of being the best again			2
' i 've had a lot of setbacks in the last eight years			0
i really wondered if i could come back			0
' but i was dominant for so long			0
when you are so dominant you have a sense of confidence , ' he said			0
history joy : there were no tears when @entity4 won gold in @entity25 in 2004 jubilation : @entity4 won the 400 metres hurdles for the @entity141 in a time of 47.63 seconds - the exact same time he ran in @entity25 ' i always had a glimmer of hope			1
i was running well , then i would get injured , then as soon as i was healthy again i would get another injury			0
' but i knew i was running well enough to compete with these guys			0
i never lost that motivation to be number one again			0
having had all that success			0
that 's what kept me going			0
' at 34 , @entity4 became the oldest athlete ever to win an @entity7 medal in the event			1
but he was by no means the first to wear his emotions on his sleeve during medal ceremonies			0
@entity158 and @entity159 cried tears of joy and relief after claiming victory in the women 's lightweight double sculls			0
and heptathlete @entity166 broke down live on television as the feeling of being @entity7 champion began to sink in			0
let it all out : @entity107 @entity158 ( left ) and @entity171 ( right ) cried after they won gold medals in the women 's lightweight double sculls event tears of joy : @entity119 's @entity166 reacts after winning the women 's heptathlon @entity4 finished ahead of @entity107 hope @entity178 , whose bid for @entity7 gold ended in disappointment as he had to settle for an agonising fourth place			1
@entity178 is the world champion but he only scraped into the @entity7 final as a fastest loser after a disappointing showing in his semi-final			0
he was never in the race and , although he finished strongly , was not able to make up the ground he lost in the first half			0
@entity178 told the @entity191 : ' i just felt a bit tired tonight			0
obviously it was a big shock in the semi-final - i was surprised everyone went that fast			0
' i gave it everything i had tonight			0
a bit better structure to my race but i was just a bit too tired at the end there and narrowly missed out			0
