we did try to warn you			2
on friday here at @entity4 , @entity2 spelled out the kind of sporting challenge 15 @entity8 brothers could n’t manage			2
yet in delivering his ‘ @entity9 to 24 hours of @entity10 ’ , he was only scratching the surface			1
from where i was sitting , the weekend actually started on friday evening on @entity13			1
@entity14 had live football back on the station			2
last time we saw that , it was @entity19 high above @entity20 for the @entity21			2
friday night , it was @entity23 and his team , their loafers sinking gently into the soggy grass , as they got up close and personal with the @entity27 at a first - round visit by @entity29 to @entity31 @entity30			1
@entity30 started the mammoth weekend of televised sport by beating @entity29 in the @entity27 and the weekend ended with some @entity34 action at @entity35 , with the @entity36 taking on the @entity37 and clearly the plan was to get the telly audience right inside the game because the pitch was very much their set			1
@entity23 covered more turf than your average @entity46 midfielder in his quest for chats and sights that would illustrate that @entity21 ‘ magic ’			0
@entity52 , all dolled up , was also out there to interview @entity29 ’s dapper boss @entity54 , who he described as ‘ the second best dressed man in the ground ’			1
i can only assume @entity52 had seen @entity58 in the crowd , then ? but star of the @entity13 show was without doubt @entity63 boss @entity62			0
the younger brother of @entity66 , he is blessed with the kind of craggy countenance that looks like it might have been formed on a lathe			0
those features were under constant surveillance throughout the game , in various states of anxiety			0
but at the end - with the presenters and crowd now massed on the pitch like an al fresco version of @entity79 - he was all smile when he proclaimed after @entity30 ’s famous win , ‘ no - one will want to come here , pal , i tell ya ’			1
i for one did n’t doubt him			0
as pundit @entity85 reminded us at the end of that game on friday , @entity89 came out 24 - 21 winners at @entity91 against @entity92 in the first @entity94 international @entity30 is a rugby league town			1
come early saturday morning , that particular sport was actually taking place half a world away in @entity89 , where @entity92 ’s @entity100 future was on the line			1
it was a game that did n’t exactly ease us gently into a packed weekend of action			1
described variously on commentary as ‘ exquisite ’ and ‘ end - to - end basketball ’ , what these untrained eyes saw was a blistering clash that went right to the wire			2
it was at times breathless stuff , leaving @entity92 so near , yet so far - and me needing a bit of a lie down before the next event			1
that took place over at @entity119 where @entity121 ’s version of the ‘ @entity23 walk ’ was conducted inside the more familiar surroundings of @entity124 before the start of the lunchtime game			0
his stroll started outside the visiting team ’s dressing room where @entity130 , a flamboyant scarf defying gravity around his shoulders , was on hand to explain it would n’t be him giving the team talk behind that dressing room door			2
i finished my work with them in the hotel ’ , said @entity130			0
@entity142 was lost for words pitchside at the prospect of making a dressing room speech			0
back in the day it was clearly the fella ’s size sevens that did all the talking			0
@entity150 ( right ) lashes the ball home for @entity154 's second goal at @entity124 in the 2 - 1 win over @entity156 saturday afternoon was also to provide the emotional barometer on what was of course a weekend that was about so much more than sport			1
rugby union ’s home @entity91 was the backdrop for the second clash of the day between @entity92 and @entity89			1
and a viscerally vivid visit to the home team ’s dressing room captured the tension that was already in the air			0
from the studio , @entity171 talked about it being a ‘ stressful time ’ as we saw a group of tight - lipped rugby players trying to get their act together			2
some read match programmes , others wet dry mouths with bottles of water , while a couple just stared into the distance			0
however , it was a different set of emotions that were drawn upon elsewhere in the build - up			1
@entity189 did a sterling job of commemorating the centenary of the @entity192			0
in particular by taking @entity92 captain @entity193 to visit the grave of his counterpart from 100 years ago , who lost his life on the battlefield in may 1915			1
this then became more immediately real as the camera looked into the tearful eyes of lance corporal @entity202 , in line for the national anthem wearing his first @entity92 shirt			1
this particular playing field in @entity92 certainly felt like the perfect place for two sets of sporting warriors to also be representing a united front of remembrance			1
@entity213 of @entity214 shakes hands at the net after his straight - sets victory against @entity218 on to sunday lunchtime then , and the yes / no debate was now clearly over			1
‘ even the marketing guys did n’t think he ’d make it ’ @entity224 told us on @entity13 as she stood below the @entity218 - bereft banner advertising the @entity227 from the @entity228			1
having had a big @entity21 and plenty of athletics , @entity229 will have been delighted with their long weekend ’s work			2
what with their involvement in the rugby , and sunday also being wallpapered with their on - going @entity27 coverage , they are steadily reaffirming themselves as a competitive sport broadcaster			1
of which , much of @entity242 would surely approve ? on sunday though , the big question was would nearly 20,000 of them be welcoming @entity218 with open arms ? ‘ @entity248			1
where @entity218 made history ’ is how @entity224 sold it up			1
and as the proud @entity251 made his way through the smoke in @entity254 , and on to the court , it was clear it was the return of a favourite son			0
this location provides a fabulously atmospheric setting for watching tennis on the box			0
an arena that can be dressed dramatically , and exude a sense of the atmosphere inside it			0
however , with this first game of the week , there may have been smoke , but there was n’t much fire from @entity218 , as he lost in straight sets			1
@entity273 set up a nail - biting final weekend of @entity275 action with his win in @entity277 on sunday which of course was disappointing , but did mean that with a deft flick of the remote control , it was straight over to @entity275 channel just in time to watch @entity284 launch himself from the grid in @entity277 , and possibly on towards the title			1
and for a moment there , as the laps hit the mid-fifties , it felt like that title might be nailed on			0
especially if you got caught up in the fizzing commentary of @entity295 and @entity296 , who were going through the gears as @entity284 edged ever closer to @entity273 ’s @entity298			1
but in the end the difference between @entity284 finishing first and second was sealed back on lap 29			0
in the best piece of filmed action of the weekend , we were right there inside @entity284 ’ car as he spun off , stopped , then dragged himself straight back into the action			2
exhilarating stuff ! yet this weekend was still not over			2
off now to @entity35 and @entity309 ’s coverage of the @entity34 , where they were showing @entity248 ’s latest live regular season game			0
the channel ’s remit with this sport is to welcome in as many of the casual and the curious as possible			2
so it looked a very smart move indeed when they threw a couple of well - known speed merchants at their coverage			2
@entity322 ( no 88 ) holds on tight as he gets a battering after scoring a first - half touchdown for the @entity36 @entity325 was enlisted to report from the touchline and help track down a few familiar faces			2
and i was a little surprised not to see a disgruntled @entity329 among them , clutching a gardening fork and bucket of sand			0
while in the studio up in the stands , @entity337 highlights programme co-hosts @entity335 and @entity336 were joined by the man whose punditry work in athletics is , much like his running had been , pure gold			0
@entity345 may have been there as a ‘ superfan ’ but he really knew his stuff			0
add in that voice and sheer presence , and it ’s more convincing than @entity352 telling us , ‘ these are not the droids you ’re looking for ’			0
indeed , he even knew @entity36 quarterback @entity357 , ‘ was not that passionate about football			0
he loves golf ’ ’			0
and that he would be ‘ key to the offense ’			0
even with a dodgy back , and in just three quarters of the game , he was indeed , just that			0
so the @entity36 brought my jam - packed long weekend of settee - hugging sport on the telly to an end with a victory over the @entity37			1
three days that were not so much a sprint , more a triathlon .			1

it had been *billed* as a 24 - hour special of televised sport
but what was described as a sprint turned into a 48 - hour triathlon
@entity30 started the weekend of sport by beating @entity29 in the @entity27
@entity89 came out 24 - 21 winners at @entity91 against @entity92
@entity156 and @entity218 were both given a beating
@entity273 set up a nail - biting final weekend of @entity390 with a win in @entity277
