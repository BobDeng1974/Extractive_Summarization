by @entity0 former @entity2 mep @entity1 said it would be unreasonable if his son was not able to make a pitch @entity7 must be allowed to stand in a conservative leadership contest even if he is not an mp , his father demanded yesterday			2
former @entity2 mep @entity1 said it would be unreasonable if his son was not able to make a pitch for the @entity2 party ’s top job if @entity15 steps down after the 2015 general election			1
@entity17 mayor mr @entity1 is not currently an mp and has said he has no plans to stand before his second term runs out in 2016			1
but mr @entity1 senior called on the party to change the rules so his son could stand			1
his father waded into the leadership speculation last night by revealing : ‘ it would not be a reasonable expression of the way things are if there were to be an election in the @entity2 party for leader under whatever rules they have - it just would n’t be reasonable if @entity7 somehow was not able to be a candidate			2
’ mr @entity1 added that , if his son was still mayor , ‘ it would be up to the party to find a way of making sure the proper candidates are there ’			1
he pointed to 1963 when @entity40 mounted a leadership campaign from the @entity42 where he was a hereditary peer before becoming an mp			0
‘ @entity40 was not a member of the @entity45			0
he was a peer but they found a way , ’ mr @entity1 said			1
he added : ‘ do n’t tell me it would n’t be possible to have a system whereby you say : ok life has moved on , there are now important elective offices			0
‘ maybe even an elected mep could stand			2
at the moment , it says only an mp can stand			0
well how reasonable is to say we exclude the @entity59 ? if you say exclude the @entity59 , how reasonable would it be to exclude the mayor of a major city ? ’ mr @entity1 is not currently an mp and has said he has no plans to stand before his second term runs out			1
his father says he should be able to go for the top job if @entity15 steps down after the 2015 general election mr @entity1 has already been privately urged to make a return to the @entity68 before the general election by the prime minister and chancellor			1
in theory , mr @entity1 could juggle the final year of his mayoralty while serving as an mp			1
there will be pressure on the prime minister to follow his predecessor @entity76 and quit immediately if he fails to win a majority			0
mr @entity76 stood down straight after losing the 2005 election , giving the relatively unknown mr @entity15 six months to prepare his campaign and emerge as a serious contender			2
the mayor ’s father also let slip that his son was a closet fan of @entity84			0
mr @entity1 senior – who served as a @entity84 commissioner twice and an @entity1 – said his son ‘ is a very good pro-european			1
he basically had a perfectly good @entity84 upbringing , he went to the @entity85			0
do n’t tell me he is not			0
you ca n’t be called @entity7 without having a @entity84 vocation			0
’ yet the @entity17 mayor just days ago told a newspaper that being in the @entity95 was ‘ not the be all and end all ’			2
‘ pulling out would be much less disastrous than people claim			0
there would n’t be a great implosion , just as there was n’t when we refused to join the euro			0
’ his father ’s candour could deter rank and file @entity107 from backing mr @entity1 .			1

@entity1 says party must *ensure* ' proper candidates are there '
mr @entity1 says he has no plans to stand for 2015 election
' how reasonable would it be to exclude the mayor of a major city ? ’ he said
