@entity0 only ever strikes during heavy ' vulcanian ' or ' plinian ' explosions when the amount of red lava is low by @entity4 published : 12:23 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 19:38 est , 19 march 2013 streaks of crimson lava soar hundreds of feet into the air as an erupting volcano puts on the most spectacular of light shows			1
but @entity10 is n’t quite finished yet			2
she throws in blinding flashes of forked lightning , which crack the red - hot sky and show just the sort of fireworks she has at her command			1
light show : @entity0 emerges from lava erupting from the @entity21 in the @entity23 area of @entity24 in this picture taken by @entity27 photographer @entity26 rare : @entity0 only ever strikes a volcanic eruption during heavy ' vulcanian ' or ' plinian ' explosions when the amount of red lava is very low this awesome display of natural power was captured by @entity27 photographer @entity26 , who waits patiently for days in remote locations for exactly the right explosive moment			1
scientists ca n’t quite explain how the phenomenon of volcano lightning occurs			2
they believe electrically - charged particles of ash disgorged during the eruption somehow react with the atmosphere to create the forks of clear white light			0
mr @entity26 , 45 , spends his life in the world ’s volcano hotspots – travelling from @entity49 to @entity50 – to capture the grandeur of an erupting firestorm			1
this stunning photo of volcanic lightning striking an erupting crater was taken last month at the @entity57 volcano near the southern tip of @entity24			1
waiting game : patient mr @entity26 waited days before finally capturing the lightstorm images on february 25 , 2013 , at around 4.50am ‘ you have very few chances to catch lightning close to an erupting volcano because it involves being very patient and waiting for many days , ’ mr @entity26 said			1
‘ i waited around four days for @entity57			0
knowing that very few people have ever experienced something so beautiful gives a very special feeling			0
i will never ever forget those moments surrounded by poisonous gas , feeling the heat of the flowing and bubbling lava and hearing noises louder than a plane taking off			1
sometimes your body can feel the shockwaves and the ground is shaking			0
’ he shrugs off the dangers of being so close to molten lava			1
‘ it ’s great fun , and so unique			0
i have had fewer mishaps chasing eruptions than when mountain climbing , ’ he said			0
drama : volcanoes are an opening or vent in the @entity91 's crust			2
when gas and magma builds up under the surface it eventually erupts above the surface through this gap , spewing rocks , lava and ash danger : the lava can reach @entity103 and burn everything in its path			2
these flows are currents of hot gas and rock that reach temperatures of @entity111 and travel up to 500mph equipment : mr @entity26 shot the magnificent photos on a highly sensitive full format dslr with a shorter ( 90 - 200mm ) but very bright tele - lens a volcano is essentially an opening or vent in the @entity91 ’s crust			1
when gas and magma – the hot fluid under the surface – build up they erupt through this gap , spewing hot rocks , ash and lava reaching @entity128 ( @entity130 )			2
but when lightning follows , it is a different type from that seen in thunderstorms			0
dr @entity135 , head of volcanology at @entity137 , explained volcanic lightning is still a natural mystery			0
‘ @entity0 typically forms as ash particles are charged through friction during eruption and dispersion in the atmosphere , ’ she said			1
‘ ice particles in the atmosphere are also involved			0
but scientists are unclear about the exact mechanisms			0

@entity27 photographer @entity26 captured these images near the @entity21 in @entity24
he seeks out the *exploding* phenomena in active volcanoes right across the world
@entity0 only ever strikes during heavy ' vulcanian ' or ' plinian ' explosions when the amount of red lava is low
