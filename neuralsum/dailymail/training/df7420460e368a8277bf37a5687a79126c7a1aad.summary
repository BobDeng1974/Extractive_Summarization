jockey @entity0 has insisted he detected the same fire and racing desire burning within @entity3 as the 2013 @entity5 winner stepped on a racecourse for the first time in over a year			1
the rider ’s enthusiastic reaction was one of the reasons @entity12 took the dramatic reaction of slashing @entity3 ’s odds of regaining the @entity16 crown in march to 2 - 1 favourite from 7 - 2			1
sponsors betway make him a 3 - 1 shot			2
the plan now is to run @entity3 in the @entity22 at @entity23 on january 17			1
@entity3 takes place in a schooling session before returning to racing at @entity27 @entity28 spoke after riding the @entity30 - trained eight - year - old for the first time since he was pulled up suffering from a fibrillating heart in the @entity33 at last year ’s @entity35 meeting			1
@entity0 was impressed by @entity3 's comeback performance the pair worked over a mile and five furlongs of the @entity40 track , jumping five fences down the back straight before being allowed to stride clear of his lead horse , @entity37 - ridden tanks for that , up the home straight			1
@entity28 added that a mistake at the second fence , when @entity3 took off far too soon , was also a positive			1
the @entity51 jockey said : ‘ i was meeting ( the fence ) a little long and @entity52 fancied it a bit and came up out of my hands			1
if he had put in a short stride i would be more worried			2
you ’d have said he is not as boisterous as he was			2
‘ he was full of it			2
that is what i would have expected 13 months ago			2
’ despite no repeats of the heart problem since the @entity67 incident , @entity30 had taken the precaution of having equine cardiology specialist @entity69 , who has treated @entity3 , present			1
the trainer said he had been keen to clear any psychological hurdles @entity3 might have faced on his return to a racecourse			1
he added : ‘ you have to bear in mind it is an horrendous experience for him			2
the worry is it leaves a scar			2
that was why we wanted this public experience			0
‘ it needed to be on a race day to have some atmosphere rather than coming tomorrow morning and going around on his own			0
‘ we had to make sure he has gone through a barrier he was comfortable with			0
that will surely give him confidence			0
he can now gallop away happily and that was the object of the exercise			0
he enjoyed himself which was the important thing			0
' the former @entity16 winner has not raced since suffering from a fibrillating heart over a year ago @entity96 thinks @entity99 winner @entity97 could be the best jumper he has trained after his win over @entity102			1
the gelding is 10 - 1 for the @entity104 ’ @entity105			0
@entity30 conceded that the path to recovery has been far form smooth adding : ‘ we were struggling at the beginning of the season and it has n’t all been that easy so far			0
it has taken a bit longer than you would have liked but you have to be patient			0
‘ we now have roughly three weeks until @entity23 so has three more good pieces of work to do			0
’ meanwhile , @entity30 insisted he and @entity28 were satisfied with 2013 @entity118 winner @entity117 despite his last place finish behind @entity120 in the @entity121 at @entity122 on sunday			1
it was the gelding ’s first run since winning the race 12 months earlier and he is now likely to head straight to the @entity118 in march			0
@entity30 said : ‘ we were happy			0
@entity0 said he felt fantastic and jumped great but the ground was as holding as they have had it there for a long time and he does n’t like it			1
‘ if he jumps as well on better ground , we are in the ball game			0
’ trainer @entity30 gives @entity3 a once over after a workout at @entity27 @entity30 and @entity28 went on to land a double at @entity27 with @entity136 and @entity137			1
the latter strengthened the trainer ’s hand in the @entity141 when beating @entity143 four and a half lengths despite carrying 10lb more in the juvenile hurdle			0
joint owners @entity145 and @entity147 are also building a formidable @entity141 team which also includes @entity30 ’s @entity149 and @entity150 , the @entity152 - trained winner of the @entity153 at @entity154 on saturday .			1

@entity3 returned for first time since suffering from a fibrillating heart
jockey @entity0 was *pleased* with his *competitive* performance
former @entity16 winner is now favourite to regain the title in 2015
