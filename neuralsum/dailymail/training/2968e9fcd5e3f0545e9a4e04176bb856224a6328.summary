most of us are all too familiar with the rage that ensues when fiddly plastic tags defy all attempts to remove them			0
but @entity7 has come up with a solution in the shape of a new set of easy - open ties - that will be launched just in time for @entity13			1
the brainchild of the team at @entity17 , which is based at @entity18 , @entity14 are made from recyclable paper and lock the product in place			1
impossible : many of us will be all too familiar with the challenges involved in prising toys from their boxes like the traditional plastic variety , they keep toys secured in their box but can be torn away with ease - finally eliminating packaging rage			1
the new design is part of the @entity36 high street brand 's bid to boost its eco credentials , with the company hoping to become the world 's most sustainable major retailer by 2020			0
as a result of innovations already in place , the company has already reduced by two billion the number of plastic bags it uses and sends zero waste to landfill			0
@entity7 has also become the first retailer to receive the triple award of certification for achievements in carbon , water and waste reduction from the @entity56			2
but while the company 's green plans are good news for the environment , for customers , getting rid of irritating plastic ties is set to prove the icing on the cake			2
the ties , which use a stronger , more flexible version of regular paper , have already been rolled out in the toy department , and will later be used across several product ranges			1
new and improved : @entity7 toys such as this @entity71 are now held in place with easy - open paper ties ever hopeful : with @entity13 on the way , @entity7 hope the new packaging will come in handy for parents speaking about the new look packaging , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , at @entity7 said : ' getting toys out of their packaging can be a big frustration for consumers and we have been working really hard over the last 18 months to find a solution			1
' the @entity14 are designed to be as effective as plastic or metal ties , but can be torn easily - no more accidents trying to cut plastic and wire ties on christmas day , and no more frustrated children waiting to play with their new toy			2
' ' our design team devised the initial concept for the ties as a direct response to the frustration caused by hard to open toy packaging , ' added @entity101 , creative director at @entity17			1
' we identified a new paper material that is very strong and used it to create a user focused way of holding products in packs			0
' not only is the product much easier to open but the material is better for the environment			0
it is very exciting to see the team at @entity7 develop our initial idea and take it to market			0
