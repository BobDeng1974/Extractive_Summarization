by @entity0 published : 07:00 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 08:32 est , 4 march 2013 for most of us , exploring the iconic sights of @entity3 involves negotiating the thronged streets craning your neck to admire some of the city 's towering buildings from below			1
but one intrepid photographer decided to sightsee from a better angle , far removed from the hustle and bustle of the capital			0
@entity14 scaled cranes and stood precariously close to the rooftop edges of some of @entity3 's tallest buildings , climbing up to 570ft at times to take this stunning collection of city nightscape snapshots			1
stunning : web designer @entity14 scaled derelict buildings and cranes in @entity3 to take a series of stunning images of @entity3 's best loved landmarks at night bright lights : fireworks light up the night sky above the bright blue @entity29 in the background of this shot , with the @entity32 on the city 's @entity33 pictured in the foreground bustling streets : among the landmarks that can be seen in this image are the @entity39 , the @entity29 , @entity40 and the arch of @entity42 iconic : the @entity43 , or 30 @entity44 , is among the buildings pictured , left , in the financial district of @entity3 , while the dome of @entity40 's stands out in the image on the right the 28 - year - old web designer travels @entity51 exploring derelict buildings to see sights that many of us will never get to see			1
but he decided to spend the last year perched above the @entity3 skyline in order to capture its bright lights from the best possible angle			1
he said : ' @entity61 scrapers and iconic buildings are wonderful things and i think it 's a shame that only the office workers within are able to enjoy the views they offer - especially since they frequently bustle around their work places without ever really appreciating those views			2
' combining that with the beauty of a city after dark , lit up with millions of fluorescent lights , and you have a beautiful view and an extremely peaceful atmosphere			0
' at 175m above ground you do n't hear much of the city noise so you become slightly detached from the frenetic energy below , you can just relax and enjoy			0
' moon river : the bright lights of @entity3 are reflected on the surface of the @entity39 around @entity84 dizzying : @entity14 climbed heights of up to 570ft in a bid to capture these stunning nightscape shots of @entity3 from the best angle dangerous : @entity14 , whose feet are pictured dangling in a vertigo inducing shot from the top of a central @entity3 crane , says that he never puts his life in danger when taking his pictures most of the pictures in @entity14 's collection of @entity3 were captured in one night from the top of a crane in the @entity99 overlooking the @entity101 's banking heart			1
elaborate architecture : @entity103 looks stunning from a bird 's eye view at night among the iconic buildings and landmarks captured in the collection of shots is the @entity29 , seen lit up in a brilliant blue , @entity84 , the @entity110 , @entity40 and the @entity32			1
one vertigo inducing image shows photographer @entity14 's feet dangling over the edge of a crane , the city streets seemingly miles below			1
he said : ' being high up among similar tall buildings is a different feeling to being high up with everything else 20 or more floors below you , and makes for better images in my opinion			0
' i believe this selection was taken over four trips around @entity3 , usually from 9pm onwards , more often after 11pm			2
' obviously this can vary depending on the time of year , since it 's easier to be sneaky after dark			2
' from a photographic point of view i 'd love to visit around blue hour - the time after sunset when there is still colour in the sky - but this is trickier and is something i need to work out over the summer			0
' but @entity14 said that although his exploits may seem dangerous , he avoids pushing himself too close to the limit			2
he added ' with roof tops , and any kind of urban exploration , it 's as safe or dangerous as you make it			0
' stay within your own limitations and comfort levels and the risk is minimal			0
' remember that construction workers clamber over the same structures every day - albeit wearing high visibility jackets and hard hats - so it 's not as dangerous as it seems at face value			2
' of course if you decide to drape yourself over the edge of the crane counter-weight or around the wrong side of a safety barrier then the situation changes			0
' i try to avoid dying , it would put a bit of a downer on my day			0
' towering : one of @entity3 's newest , but definitely tallest , landmarks @entity110 , dwarfs neighbouring buildings in this cityscape , left , while the normally bustling roads and pavements look all but deserted in this nighttime shot , right intrepid : @entity14 explores derelict buildings and takes pictures from high spots because he thinks it 's a shame that only those that work in skyscrapers normally get to appreciate such views big city : the @entity29 , lit up in a brilliant blue , stands out in the middle of this picture of @entity3 's sprawling urban landscape			1
