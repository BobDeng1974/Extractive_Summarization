by @entity0 they may only be tiny , and live for just three months , but ants could be the key to solving climate change			0
rough harvester ants have been found to ‘ weather ’ minerals in sand to produce calcium carbonate , also known as limestone			1
when the ants make this limestone , the process traps carbon dioxide in the rock , ultimately removing it from the atmosphere			1
researcher @entity15 buried sand at six sites in @entity18 , 25 years ago			1
every five years , he measured how much the minerals olivine and plagioclase degraded and discovered the ants ( rough harvester ant pictured ) break down minerals up to 300 times faster than sand left undisturbed it is unsure how the minerals are converted , however , and theories range from ants licking the sand , to excreting the substance			1
the ants are believed to collect calcium and magnesium , and use these elements to make limestone			1
this process is similar to the process known as carbon sequestration			0
natural carbon sequestration is the process on @entity41 that manages the carbon dioxide expelled by animals , plants and humans			1
trees and the oceans help convert or trap this carbon dioxide			2
there are also artificial carbon sequestration schemes that involve manually trapping this carbon dioxide in the ground			2
one proposed method is ocean sequestration , in which carbon dioxide is placed deep in the ocean , forming lakes of the gas			2
these gases stay where they are due to the pressure and temperature of the surrounding water , gradually dissolving over time			0
another method is geological sequestration where the carbon dioxide is pumped into underground chamber , or into areas full of magnesium and calcium			1
carbon dioxide reacts with these elements to form limestone and magnesite			1
it is this latter method that @entity15 discovered the ants perform naturally			0
the discovery was made by professor @entity15 from the @entity76			0
professor @entity15 buried sand at six sites in the @entity80 in @entity18 , and @entity81 in @entity82 , 25 years ago			1
every five years , he measured how much the minerals olivine and plagioclase degraded in the sand , and discovered the ants break down minerals up to 300 times faster than sand left undisturbed			1
professor @entity15 believes the ants collect calcium and magnesium and use these elements to make the limestone			1
the conversion may occur when ants lick sand grains in order to stick them to the walls of their nests			0
alternatively , the limestone could be created from bacteria in the insects gut before it is excreted			0

but , professor @entity15 claims it is still unknown how much atmospheric carbon is removed by the ants			2
the findings are published in the journal @entity176			0
earlier this month , @entity178 scientists at the @entity179 said leafcutter ants could save lives thanks to a natural antibiotic they produce			0
the pioneering research by the @entity184 centred on a particular type of fungus the ants eat , and how the ants ’ natural resistance protects it .			0

ants ‘ weather ’ minerals in sand to produce calcium carbonate *-* or limestone
this conversion traps and removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
it is unsure how the minerals are converted , and theories range from ants licking the sand to excreting it
researcher @entity15 buried sand at six sites in @entity18 25 years ago
every five years , he measured how much minerals in the sand had degraded
ants break down minerals up to 300 times faster than sand left undisturbed
@entity15 thinks the ants may be *scavenging* calcium and magnesium from the minerals and using these elements to make limestone
