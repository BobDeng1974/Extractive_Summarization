in 2008 there was a ' media blackout ' and the @entity22 media officially agreed with @entity72 not to publish the fact @entity157 was serving in @entity158			0
however , he hastily left the warzone after @entity9 's @entity162 magazine broke a global media promise not to declare his presence in the country , as did a @entity167 news website			2
