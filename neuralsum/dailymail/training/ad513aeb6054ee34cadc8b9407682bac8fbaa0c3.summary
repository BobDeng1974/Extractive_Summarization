@entity4 , first lady @entity6 and daughters @entity7 and @entity9 are scheduled to depart @entity10 on wednesday morning			1
the president will visit @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			1
in the latter country , artist @entity15 put the finishing touches on a painting of @entity4 and @entity14 's leader @entity19 today ahead of the president 's visit			1
warm welcome : @entity15 puts the finishing touches on a painting of @entity4 and @entity14 's leader @entity19 ahead of the president 's visit the sign read : ' welcome to @entity14 your home @entity4 ' and had portraits of a smiling @entity4 and more serious looking @entity19			1
when @entity4 arrives in @entity12 this week , there will be one notable omission from his travel itinerary : @entity32 , the birthplace of his father and home to many of his relatives			1
concerns about @entity32 's political situation have trumped @entity4 's family ties			1
@entity32 's new president is facing charges of crimes against humanity in the @entity44 , accused of orchestrating the violence that marred the country 's 2007 election			2
ahead of @entity50 's victory earlier this year , a top @entity4 administration official warned @entity32 that their ' choices have consequences ' - a remark that now appears prescient given the president 's decision to skip a stop in his ancestral homeland			1
return to his roots : @entity4 has not visited @entity32 since 2006 when he was a senator ( pictured ) ' the optics of that , of a presidential trip , are not what he wants to be demonstrating right now , ' said @entity63 , @entity12 director at the @entity64			1
the @entity65 did consider a visit to @entity32 when they contemplated an @entity68 swing during the president 's first term , before @entity50 's election			1
that trip never happened , but @entity4 pledged that he would , in fact , visit @entity32 before leaving office			1
' i 'm positive that before my service as president is completed i will visit @entity32 again , ' he said in a 2010 interview with @entity32 's state broadcaster			1
@entity65 officials say they respect the right of @entity32 to choose their own leaders			0
but deputy national security adviser @entity83 said the @entity84 also has ' a commitment to accountability and justice '			0
president @entity4 , first lady @entity89 and their daughters @entity7 and @entity9 ( pictured last week returning from a trip to @entity93 and @entity94 ) are due to leave for @entity12 on wednesday ' given the fact that @entity32 is in the aftermath of their election and the new government has come into place and is going to be reviewing these issues with the @entity44 and the international community , it just was n't the best time for the president to travel to @entity32 , ' @entity83 said			1
@entity32 's government has been muted in its response to the president 's decision to leave the county off his itinerary			2
' it 's for the @entity84 to decide where @entity4 goes , ' spokesman @entity112 said			1
' there are 54 nations on the @entity68 continent and he 's only visiting three , so i do n't see the real big deal about not going to @entity32			0
' but @entity120 , a political activist who lives in @entity121 , @entity122 's largest slum , said the @entity84 president was sending a message about @entity32 's political problems by putting democratic values ahead of his personal connections			2
' it would be a shame for an @entity84 president to come to @entity32 and shake dirty hands , ' @entity120 said			2
by now , @entity4 's ties with @entity32 are a well - known part of his unique family history			1
@entity135 was born in the western @entity32 village of @entity137 , moved to the @entity84 to study , and met and married the president 's mother in @entity140			2
he left the family soon after his son was born			0
@entity4 made his first trip to @entity32 in 1988 , after his father 's death , and wrote extensively about the visit in his memoir ' @entity143			1
' ' my name belonged and so i belonged , drawn into a web of relationships , alliances and grudges that i did not yet understand , ' he wrote			0
the president visited @entity32 two more times , most recently in 2006 as a freshman senator			0
he was greeted by cheering crowds in the capital of @entity122 and in @entity137 , where he spent time with his grandmother and visited his father 's grave			0
he and wife @entity89 also publicly took @entity164 tests , part of their campaign at the time to reduce the stigma surrounding the virus			0
but @entity4 's nationally televised speech criticizing the government for failing to curb corruption or instill trust in its people earned him a cold shoulder from @entity32 's leadership			2
@entity32 's presidential spokesman said at the time that @entity4 was ignorant of @entity32 politics and had yet to form an understanding of foreign policy			2
@entity32 's president @entity50 has been charged by the @entity44 as an ' indirect co-perpetrator ' for the crimes of murder , deportation , rape and inhumane acts @entity32 is an important strategic partner for the @entity84 in @entity188			0
but the recent election has complicated the relationship			0
@entity191 , who until april served as head of the @entity194 's @entity12 bureau , said in the lead - up to this year 's election that ' choices have consequences , ' a comment that was viewed as a warning against electing @entity50			2
his remarks were widely criticized as an inappropriate intrusion into a sovereign nation 's elections			0
@entity50 , the son of the country 's first president , has been charged by the @entity44 as an ' indirect co-perpetrator ' for the crimes of murder , deportation , rape , persecution and inhumane acts allegedly committed by his supporters in the aftermath of the 2007 elections			0
