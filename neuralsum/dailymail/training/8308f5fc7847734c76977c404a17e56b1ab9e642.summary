by @entity0 last updated at 12:54 am on 30th august 2011 many @entity1 spent their time indoors during @entity2 playing board games , watching re-runs of @entity5 or just being plain bored			2
but one 25 - year - old mother decided to create a @entity8 feed joking about @entity1 mayor @entity10 's attempts to speak @entity11 - and it ’s already been a roaring success			1
@entity14 , of @entity15 , @entity1 , created @ @entity16 to make fun of when mayor @entity10 answers questions at press conferences in broken @entity11			1
no excuso ! ’ others include : ' @entity39			0
que parko anywhere ! ' ; and ' @entity42 @entity41 ! ' ms @entity43 mocked mayor @entity10 for his ‘ laughable ’ @entity11 , but his efforts to connect with the huge @entity47 community in @entity1 have been generally seen positively			1
she has only been tweeting on the account since saturday , but already has more than 12,000 followers			2
it seems mayor @entity10 also sees the funny side , as when he was asked about the account in a press conference by a journalist , he replied in @entity11 before concluding : ‘ @entity55 ? ’ ms @entity43 admitted it is ‘ great that he wants to speak @entity11 ’ and told the @entity58 his administration handled the storm preparation ‘ very well ’			2
but she does n’t think he should have spoken the language at all			0
account : ms @entity43 mocks mayor @entity10 for his ' laughable ' @entity11 , but his efforts to connect with the huge @entity47 community in @entity1 have been generally seen as a good thing ‘ i think that if he really wanted to get a message across to the @entity47 community he should have stepped aside and had someone who speaks @entity11 fluently deliver the message , ’ she said			1
ms @entity43 got the ‘ @entity22 ’ name from picturing @entity70 political commentator @entity69 saying the name , in a similar vein to how he usually calls mayor @entity73 ’			0
she told the @entity58 that his @entity11 ‘ gave me a laugh - which i needed being stuck in an apartment with a fussy baby ’ and her @entity78 father speaks the language fluently			0
good fun : mayor @entity10 , left , also sees the funny side of the account by @entity14 , right ‘ i can feed the baby with one hand and tweet on my phone with the other , ’ she said , pointing out that she accredits her wit to her late grandfather			1
‘ i think that if he really wanted to get a message across to the @entity47 community he should have stepped aside and had someone who speaks @entity11 fluently deliver the message ' @entity14 , @ @entity16 mayor @entity10 can certainly count on her vote , as she has already voted for him and would ‘ probably vote for him again ’			1
she will continue tweeting on the account ‘ as long as it stays fun ’			0
two of his best responses in ' spanglish ' to questions at press conferences reportedly included the phrases ' the streets have cleaned ' and ' it was a lot of windy '			0
