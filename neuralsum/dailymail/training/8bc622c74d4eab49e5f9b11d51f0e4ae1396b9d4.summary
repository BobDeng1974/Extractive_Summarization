@entity0 was delighted to welcome a third @entity2 male entrant into the @entity3 singles when @entity4 came through the qualifying event to make the main draw			1
@entity0 , 27 , is increasingly taking on a mentoring role when it comes to his younger compatriots but when the main action begins he will need to focus exclusively on himself			1
and according to former @entity2 no 1 @entity13 , who had a spell coaching @entity15 ’s @entity4 last year , the stakes could hardly be higher this season for the @entity17			1
@entity13 believes @entity0 will need to display attacking intent in order to win a major in 2015 @entity4 qualified for the main draw and become the third @entity2 male entrant into the @entity3 @entity0 ( left ) pictured in training ahead of the @entity3 as coach @entity23 ( right ) watches on ‘ this year will be the defining year for @entity0			1
i think 2015 will tell us if he will ever win a major again , ’ said @entity13 , who described the scheduled run here of @entity0 facing @entity26 in the fourth round and @entity28 in the quarter - finals as a ‘ brutal draw ’			1
while believing he can negotiate it , @entity13 — commentating for @entity33 on the event — believes he will need to display attacking intent all the way			1
‘ if he ’s going to come out and win this tournament , he needs to be aggressive on the second serve , take on the forehand when it ’s there to be hit and use the backhand up the line			0
‘ if he does those things he has a real shot			0
@entity0 has an incredible sense of what he needs to do at the big moments in the big matches , which is so important			1
@entity23 [ his coach ] would have had all of the off - season to work on the areas of @entity0 ’s game that needed working on and physically he looks very , very well			1
last year was a season of change for @entity0 ( left ) , who parted ways with trainer @entity57 ( right ) @entity0 also split with another of his coaching staff in @entity60 ( right ) last november the @entity17 has taken to mentoring young @entity2 talent but @entity13 says he must focus on himself ‘ his performance in @entity63 [ earlier this month ] , where he absolutely destroyed @entity64 in two sets , was the best i ’ve seen him play in a long time and he played well in the @entity67 , too			1
it ’s a good opportunity to see where @entity0 really is at the moment			2
’ @entity0 certainly looks primed for a decent run at a tournament where his record is admirably consistent			2
prior to his quarter - final loss 12 months ago to @entity28 , not long after returning from back surgery , he had reached three finals and a semi-final in four years			0
he will kick off his campaign on the opening day of the tournament — the early hours of monday morning @entity2 time — with a match on the newly enhanced @entity81 , which now has a sliding roof and can house 7,500 spectators			2
his opponent will be @entity87 qualifier @entity85 , 22 , the world no 314 , who has a nice feel for the ball and won the junior @entity3 six years ago			1
he will have nothing to lose after coming through three preliminary rounds and the same can be said of @entity4 , who won his final eliminator on saturday with a gutsy 6 - 7 , 6 - 4 , 9 - 7 win over @entity96 in two hours and 23 minutes			2
him making the main draw by right just a week after his 20th birthday gave something of a feelgood factor to the @entity2 game , with @entity102 winning the women ’s title in @entity105			0
the only disappointment was that @entity107 could not join them in the main draw , falling 7 - 5 , 6 - 3 to the 36 - year - old @entity109			0
like @entity110 , who will face @entity111 on tuesday , @entity4 was a visitor to @entity0 ’s december training camp in @entity113 and managed to impress his host			1
the 27 - year - old is tipped for a decent run in @entity117 where his record is admirably consistent ‘ @entity4 has a good attitude , very calm with his feet on the ground , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ @entity107 got to the last round , @entity102 has won and my brother and @entity125 both won doubles events last week			0
it would be nice to have a good year for all the @entity2 players			0
i ’m pleased for @entity4 and it ’s good to see @entity107 doing well			2
they both work very hard and , when you see someone putting in the effort , it ’s nice to see them get the rewards			0
’ @entity4 has long been identified as the leading @entity2 prospect of his generation but , as with most players trying to make the transition to the top level , progress has not been entirely smooth			2
last year he finished with his long - time coach @entity141 and then had two mentors in @entity13 and @entity143 before opting to go with the latter full - time			0
he won a challenger level event in @entity146 late last season and now his renewed progression will get a good test from world no 39 @entity151 , the @entity152 who enjoyed a breakthrough season in 2014			0
against local hope @entity155 , the fair - skinned @entity4 ’s phlegmatic temperament was stretched by the home crowd , who repeatedly suggested that he needed to get the sunscreen out in the heat			0
@entity4 said : ‘ i was n’t playing 10 out of 10 tennis but i needed to be a 10 out of 10 competitor			0

@entity13 believes this will be a defining season for @entity0
the @entity17 will kick off against @entity87 qualifier @entity85 on monday
