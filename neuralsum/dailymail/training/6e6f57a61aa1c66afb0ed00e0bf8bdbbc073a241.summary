as a @entity2 senator , @entity0 won $ 48 million in federal funding to help @entity4 destroy thousands of tons of guns and ammunition – weapons which are now unavailable to the @entity10 army as it faces down @entity13 president @entity12 during his invasion of @entity15			1
in august 2005 , just seven months after his swearing - in , @entity0 traveled to @entity17 in @entity4 with then - @entity19 @entity18 senator @entity18 , touring a conventional weapons site			1
the two met in @entity22 with president @entity23 , making the case that an existing @entity25 covering the destruction of nuclear weapons should be expanded to include artillery , small arms , anti-aircraft weapons , and conventional ammunition of all kinds			1
after a stopover in @entity35 , the senators returned to @entity36 and declared that the @entity2 should devote funds to speed up the destruction of more than 400,000 small arms , 1,000 anti-aircraft missiles , and more than 15,000 tons of ammunition			1
the @entity69 had already identified some 7 million small arms and light weapons , and 2 million tons of conventional ammunition , warehoused in more than 80 weapons depots spread across the country			2
many of the artillery shells shown in photographs from @entity17 , multiple weapons experts told @entity78 , would be the same types of ammunition required to repel advancing @entity13 divisions as they advanced to the west , had they not been destroyed			0
two experts said the ammunition , particularly small - arms rounds , would have been useful to train @entity4 's armed forces and million - strong reserves			2
' vast stocks of conventional munitions and military supplies have accumulated in @entity4 , ' @entity0 said in am august 30 , 2005 statement from @entity17			0
' some of this stockpile dates from @entity93 , yet most dates from @entity96 buildup and the stocks left behind by @entity56 withdrawals from @entity99 , the @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			0
' ' we need to eliminate these stockpiles for the safety of the @entity10 people and people around world , by keeping them out of conflicts around the world			0
' more than a year later , president @entity112 signed into law a proposal authored by @entity0 and @entity18			0
in 2006 @entity4 president @entity23 ( @entity53 ) warmly received @entity18 and @entity0 in @entity22 @entity13 infantry vehicles have met no significant resistance from @entity10 armed forces as they move into the nation 's sovereign territory sen. @entity18 lost his seat in 2012 after it emerged that he no longer lived in @entity19 , the state he represented			1
@entity0 became president in 2008 , and now faces a crisis in the nation he once sought to disarm @entity0 said then that the existing @entity25 ' has effectively disposed of thousands of weapons of mass destruction , but we must do far more to keep deadly conventional weapons like anti-aircraft missiles out of the hands of terrorists			0
' much of the @entity10 small - arms supply was ultimately exported , not scrapped , by a @entity23 regime that chose revenue from arms dealing over the cost of melting down metal			0
in 2008 the @entity137 reported that between 2004 and 2007 , the @entity138 told the @entity69 that it sent 721,777 small arms and light weapons to 27 different countries			2
the @entity2 was the top recipient , with more than 260,000 of those weapons , followed by the @entity144 and @entity145 , which each imported more than 101,000			1
that flood of weapons exports has continued , with annual export records showing hundreds of thousands of new exports each year , covering everything from pistols and carbine rifles to heavy machine guns and anti-tank weapons			0
payback : @entity0 presented @entity18 with the @entity157 in november 2013 @entity13 president @entity12 ( c ) sent troops into the @entity15 , a @entity10 peninsula populated by more than 1 million ethnic @entity13 , without meeting significant military resistance but while today 's 130,000 - strong standing @entity10 military is n't short on @entity162 , @entity13 troops have met little to no large - scale resistance from armored divisions or heavy artillery as they steamrolled their way into @entity15			1
some of that was @entity4 's own doing – it sold 320 tanks to @entity169 in the 1990s , for instance – but @entity0 and @entity18 accelerated the pace of the country 's arms liquidation			1
while the @entity10 army seems to have been careful to avoid provoking an even larger conflict , it 's impossible to know whether @entity12 would have behaved differently in the face of columns of heavy weapons that once belonged to the @entity56 in whose @entity180 he held a high - ranking position			2
@entity185 video broadcast on tuesday showed @entity13 troops firing automatic weapons over the heads of apparently unarmed @entity10 @entity190 personnel near a contested airfield in @entity15 .			0

@entity0 traveled to @entity4 with sen. @entity18 in 2005 just seven months after he became a senator , touring *surplus* weapons stockpiles
most of the small arms and ammunition were left over when @entity56 withdrew from @entity67 nations , and later dumped in @entity4
the two senators *secured* @entity2 funding to help destroy the weapons instead of *leaving* them intact
@entity4 exported more than *700,000* small arms in 2004 - 2007 , including 101,000 each to @entity145 and the @entity144 , and 260,000 to the @entity2
but most of the ammunition stockpiles – *crucial* for keeping a standing army battle - ready – were destroyed
@entity4 is in a *staring* match with @entity13 president @entity12 , who has designs on *recapturing* portions of the former @entity56 nation
