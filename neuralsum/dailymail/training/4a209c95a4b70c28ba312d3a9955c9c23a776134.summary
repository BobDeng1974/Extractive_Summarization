perhaps the sight of those frenzied shoppers wrestling each other over a discounted tv set has left you wondering where all the traditional @entity6 good cheer has gone			1
the answer is : @entity9			1
christmas markets started in @entity11 , and @entity9 is one of the oldest of the lot			1
it is also one of the most glorious			2
there is not a whiff of christmas fatigue , no suggestion of a terse ‘ let ’s do something different this time ’ or a tetchy ‘ i ’m not hosting again after last year ’			2
city of lights : @entity9 really comes to life in november and december , when stalls fill its @entity9 square @entity9 is delighted to host and celebrate all things @entity6 from late november , with most markets closing on @entity31			1
it feels like its entire population ( at about half a million ) is on board			2
there are 11 markets dotted around the city , ranging from a handful of stalls lining a small passageway to the @entity41 to large affairs with mini fairground rides and candyfloss			1
the oldest ( now in its 580th year ) and most celebrated is the @entity46 on @entity47 in the old town			2
we gather here as daylight fades for the grand opening			2
it involves a welcome speech from the city ’s mayor , songs from a young woman in huge angel wings and a man dressed as a miner , a band , and then , as darkness falls and fairy lights in the fir trees twinkle , an enormous stollen cake ( 2,014 cm long in honour of the year , and pictured right ) is brought to the stage by the city ’s bakers			2
stollen cake ( well , the original and authentic version anyway ) is exclusive to @entity9 and @entity6			1
this one arrives with such fanfare that it should come with police outriders			2
gifts of all shapes and sizes : visitors can pick up all manner of @entity6 presents at the @entity46 love hearts and sugary serenades : baked goods are always a key element of any @entity11 @entity6 market there is an almost tangible sense of festivity and community as young families , couples and groups of friends wander around nearly 250 wooden stalls			1
there is also a strong and irresistible aroma of warm gluhwein , roasting chestnuts , bratwurst , and an entire cow roasting on a spit			0
between the food and the handbags , sweets , handmade jewellery , blown - glass ornaments , woollen hats , scarves and gloves , pottery , toys , candles and sheepskin slippers , you could wrap up most of your @entity6 shopping here in an afternoon			1
it is one big , romantic , cosy grotto , and there ’s something touchingly sincere about the market			0
perhaps this is because so many of the stalls are selling handmade things			0
there are no madly hiked prices and nothing that looks like it would break the minute you got it home			0
much smaller than the @entity46 , and completely charming , is the medieval @entity132 market in the shadow of the castle			0
it is tucked away down a passageway and , as well as handmade jewellery and bunches of mistletoe , it is full of surprises			0
fun for visitors of all ages : @entity9 's markets are a magical affair for even the youngest of visitors there are crates of wine in bottles like huge bell - bottomed test tubes , a stall devoted to ropes and twine , a smithy with antique bellows the size of a @entity160 , and a wooden toy stall where i spy primary - coloured catapults , bows and arrows and even an axe , which would make for a lively @entity6			1
we are staying at the @entity167 in the old town , and it ’s a pleasure to stroll the quiet streets amid the spectacular skyline of spires and domes — rebuilt , original brick by original brick where possible — after 15 sq miles of @entity9 ’s centre was almost levelled in 1945 by the @entity178 bombing raids			1
our guide , @entity180 , shows us black - and - white photos of the rubble and craters			0
the @entity185 , @entity186 ( @entity187 ) and the @entity188 look even more mighty and imposing when you realise how painstakingly they were put back together			0
we pass the baroque @entity191 , built on the orders of the 17th - century ruler @entity193			0
august ’s heart is buried in a silver capsule in the crypt and will , according to @entity180 , beat again when a beautiful woman walks past it			0
it seems a fitting test , as august apparently had 12 mistresses and a wife , all of whom he built palaces for			0
local delicacy : stollen cake originated in @entity9 , and is still a key feature of the city 's @entity6 markets his favourite mistress was ensconced in @entity211 ( now a hotel ) , though she overstepped her place and spent the last 49 years of her life in prison			1
but we do n’t dwell on her fate			0
it ’s @entity6 , after all , and @entity9 is one big irresistible advent calendar , with a @entity220 ’s hat on top			1
and not a flat - screen scrap or an @entity224 brawl in sight			0
double rooms at the @entity227 ( 0049 351 501 200 , www.swissotel.com/dresden ) start at £ 102 b&b per night			0
@entity229 ( 0871 405 2020 , www.cityjet.com ) flies from @entity231 airport to @entity9 from £ 127 return			1
