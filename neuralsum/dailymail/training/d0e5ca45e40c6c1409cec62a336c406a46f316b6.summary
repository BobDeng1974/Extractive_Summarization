by @entity0 published : 13:33 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 13:33 est , 11 october 2012 a ' fresh ' @entity2 meteorite that fell to @entity3 last year contains unique evidence of water weathering on the planet ’s surface			1
the rock , blasted off @entity2 some 700,000 years ago by an asteroid or comet impact , also bears traces of the planet ’s atmosphere , say scientists			1
analysis of samples of the meteorite indicates it originated on or near the @entity2 surface			1
' fresh ' : the 1.1kg chunk of the meteorite , named @entity22 after the @entity24 town near where it fell last year , that is now on display in the @entity27 in @entity28 there are also signs of elements being carried into cracks in the rock by water or fluid - something never seen before in a @entity2 meteorite			1
martian meteorites allow scientists to study the planet ’s geology on @entity3 without having to mount expensive space missions			2
however most are not found until long after their arrival , allowing them to be spoiled by @entity45 contamination and chemicals			0
the new meteorite , known as @entity22 , is one of only five to be collected after being spotted falling to @entity3			0
having broken up in the atmosphere , fragments of the rock landed on a desert region of southern @entity24 near the town of @entity22 on july 18 last year			1
the pieces were analysed by an international team of scientists that included experts at @entity28 ’s @entity27			0
a one kilogram lump of the meteorite measuring about 12 centimetres across is now on display in the museum ’s @entity62 gallery			0
dr @entity64 , meteorites curator at the @entity27 , said : ' any meteorite that is seen to fall - they ’re called " fall meteorites " - are particularly interesting because they suffer from very little contamination			0
' one of the main things we found was that some of the chemical signatures in this meteorite indicate it must be from quite close to the surface of @entity2 , or even on the surface			1
' not @entity2 : it 's actually the desert area near the @entity81 mountains in southern @entity24 where the @entity22 meteorite fell the meteorite contains large amounts of black glass , created by heat from a shock impact melting rock			1
scientists know that elements found inside the glass can not have resulted from contamination from @entity3			0
@entity91 has revealed new close up pictures of a mysterious object found on the martian surface near @entity95			2
the rover detected a bright object on the ground when it started to collect and sift @entity2 soil for the very first time			1
officials suspect the object is a piece of plastic from the rover which has dropped off , according to an initial report which describes the object , pictured below , as ' benign '			0
however they have taken a decision not to sample or scoop any more soil until they can confirm what the unidentified object is - leaving @entity95 with a scoop full of @entity2 soil			1
one of the rover drivers , @entity113 said on @entity115 that the entire team was working hard to figure that out what could have possibly come loose from the rover and they are ' crawling over rover model , tracking down testing records , etc. ' we simply do n’t know yet			0
' soon after @entity91 announced the discovery of the bright object , a humorous picture of it was posted on @entity115 with the added commentary ' oh no ! i dropped my keys ! ! '			0
one of them turned out to be cerium , an element from the @entity2 surface			1
the unusual levels of cerium suggested they had been deposited by a leeching process involving water			0
' this enrichment has happened because of the weathering process you get at the near surface of @entity2 , ' said dr @entity64			1
' water , or fluids , have picked up the cerium and gone into gaps in the rock			2
' no - one knows when this occurred , but it would have been some time before the rock was ejected from @entity2			1
nitrogen originating from @entity2 atmosphere was also identified in the black glass			1
findings from the research , conducted by 20 scientists in five countries , appear today in the journal @entity156			0
lead researcher professor @entity157 , from the @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity24 , said : ' the @entity161 meteorite found in @entity24 is very important because it is so fresh			2
' we have conclusively shown , for the first time , the chemical signatures of weathering processes on @entity2			2
' dr @entity64 said scientists on @entity3 could analyse the rock with a precision not possible using robots such as the rover curiosity , which recently landed in a @entity2 crater			1
' meteorites are known as the poor man ’s space probe , ' she said			0
she added there was absolutely no suggestion of any sign of @entity2 life in the meteorite			2
' i can say hand on heart that people have not found anything indicative of little green men or little green bugs , ' she said			0
in 1996 scientists at the @entity189 space agency @entity91 claimed to have discovered evidence of fossil microbes in a @entity2 meteorite from @entity193 known as @entity194			2
since then other experts have argued that the ' bugs ' probably have a non-biological origin .			0

the rock was blasted off the surface of @entity2 some 700,000 years ago
it landed on the southern @entity24 desert on july 18 last year
