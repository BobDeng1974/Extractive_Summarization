some pupils are naturally brighter than others , a study of twins suggests			0
the research shows inherited intelligence accounts for almost two thirds of marks in gcses , while the amount of work done in class accounts for the rest			1
this suggests raising the standard of teaching in schools may have a limited impact on children ’s academic achievement when compared with the genes they are born with			1
or , put more simply , nature trumps nurture			0
@entity24 research found inherited intelligence could account for nearly 60 per cent of a teenager 's gcse results , while quality of teaching only influences results by a third			1
the study was based upon long - term analysis of twins who sat the standard school exams at the age of 16 professor @entity35 , who based the study on the exam results of thousands of children , said genetics had been overlooked because of concerns about ‘ labelling ’ children			1
but he said his findings could spell the end of the generalised approach to schooling in favour of a system tailored to individual ability			0
genetic scanning could flag up children ’s strengths and weaknesses early on in their school career , enabling teachers to identify how best to help them			1
‘ kids label each other already			0
they know who ’s sporty , who ’s bright , ’ he told @entity55			0
‘ if we can read a kid ’s genome we can predict and prevent disease			0
if we can read their dna , we can tailor the teaching to help a kid with learning difficulties			2
surely it ’s worse to just sit in a classroom and sink , unable to read because no one has identified that you might have trouble			0
’ professor @entity35 , of the @entity74 at @entity24 , runs the @entity75 , which follows all twins born in @entity77 and @entity78 from 1994 to 1996			1
analysis of the gcse results of more than 11,100 of them suggested genetic background had a ‘ substantial ’ impact on their results			1
in science it accounted for 58 per cent of scores , in maths for 55 per cent and @entity77 52 per cent			2
iq scores have been linked with genes before and professor @entity35 said the advantage increased with age			1
‘ little genetic differences become bigger and bigger as you go through life , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity97 kids read more , they hang out with kids who read more			0
’ professor @entity35 thinks genetic scanning could eventually be used to identity particularly gifted children or those with academic weaknesses			1
by reading a child 's genome ( pictured ) , adults can predict and therefore influence a child 's academic progression , as well as prevent disease prof @entity35 believes education professionals have been too fast to dismiss the influence of genetics and intelligence on children 's academic potential			1
but he thinks his research can be used in a positive way to develop education tailored to a child 's unique needs , that will translate into better exam results professor @entity35 , an @entity123 geneticist , has been asked to present his findings to ministers and officials at the @entity127			1
a @entity127 insider said : ‘ as we learn more from science , a decentralised school system with great teachers providing personalised learning will be even more important			2
’ ‘ @entity139 tests ’ usually involve comparisons between identical and non-identical twins – or those brought up apart in different environments			0
n girls who walk to school do better in class , according to research			2
a study found that children who go by foot outperform peers who travel by bus or car			2
the difference is put down to exercise , with girls gaining more from the effort of walking			0
exercise has been shown to help the brain grow and boost memory			0
the study of 1,700 @entity161 teenagers was published in @entity162 .			0

an @entity123 scientist at @entity24 found inherited intelligence could account for nearly 60 per cent of a teenager 's gcse results
the school environment , quality of teaching and home environment has less of an effect on students ' exam results
professor @entity35 thinks genetic scanning could eventually be used to identity particularly gifted children or those with academic weaknesses
