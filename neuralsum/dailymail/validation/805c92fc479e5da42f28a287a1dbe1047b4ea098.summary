this saga ’s gone on longer than @entity1			2
and let ’s be honest — it ’s not been handled brilliantly by the @entity4			0
but you can hardly blame @entity6 for wanting to throw his lot in with @entity8 and score some first - class runs			1
his interpretation of what @entity11 said about playing in the domestic game has given him a lifeline			0
now it ’s up to @entity6 to use it			1
@entity6 has agreed to rejoin @entity8 as he looks to make an unlikely @entity18 comeback with @entity11 and @entity20 coming in as @entity4 chairman and chief executive respectively , it ’s reasonable to work on the basis that everyone starts with a clean slate			1
they could well be leaning on @entity27 , the managing director , with this basic point : the best players get picked			0
that ’s how it works in other sports , so why not in cricket ? @entity6 will have a great chance to excel in @entity35 at an excellent club			1
he ’s also fit enough , even in his mid- 30s			2
he leads a good lifestyle and he ’ll be desperate to bang the door down			2
it ’s all set up for him			0
the 35 - year - old will focus on the longer form of the game in a bid to force his way into @entity46 reckoning @entity6 still wants to add to his 23 test centuries despite being axed by @entity18 last year people are worried about his book , but the main targets in those pages — @entity53 and @entity52 — are no longer in the @entity18 set - up			1
i thought the book was a sad read , to learn that he was n’t enjoying what should have been among the best moments of his life			0
that ’s a real shame			0
but if @entity6 scores so many runs for @entity8 that @entity11 and @entity20 think he ’s irresistible , then everyone will just have to sit down and talk things through			1
yes , it would become tricky for @entity66 and @entity67 , who @entity6 did n’t rate highly in his first stint as @entity18 coach			1
but i ’d put the key players in this drama in one room and tell them not to reappear until they ’ve bashed out a compromise			2
treat it like a jury : do n’t emerge until you ’ve got a majority decision			0
the batsman , pictured playing in @entity81 's @entity80 , may change his @entity83 contract @entity67 did n't see eye to eye with @entity6 during his first spell as @entity18 head coach @entity6 is the best batsman i ’ve seen for @entity18 and if he can get his mojo back playing for @entity8 then at least he ’ll have fulfilled the criterion that @entity11 laid down			1
test cricket is what gets @entity6 ’s juices flowing			1
it ’s unrealistic to imagine he could still be around for the @entity93			0
but he ’s found himself a county and now he ’s got to get some runs			2
it ’s going to be a very interesting summer			0
@entity18 fell to an embarrassing early exit from the @entity93 after a defeat by @entity100 in @entity101			0

@entity6 agrees to return to county cricket with @entity8
the 35 - year - old is *hopeful* of forcing his way into @entity46 reckoning
he is fit enough even at 35 years old and will want to bang the door down
@entity6 did n't get on with @entity67 , but they need to compromise
