by @entity0 headteacher @entity1 has become the victim of abuse after improving lateness and discipline at the school a headteacher who was sent in to transform a failing primary has become the victim of a hate campaign after she asked parents to stop smoking at the school gates			1
@entity1 was asked to take over @entity14 after it was heavily criticised by @entity16 inspectors			1
but after improving lateness and discipline , she received a barrage of anonymous abuse from parents - including a petition entitled get the b * * * * es out , aimed at her and her female deputy			1
mrs @entity1 , 53 , arrived at the @entity25 school in september after the local authority was impressed how she vastly improved the results of a nearby primary			1
after a few weeks , she ‘ respectfully ’ asked parents to refrain from smoking outside the school ’s gates , ‘ as some may see this as setting a bad example ’			1
mrs @entity1 also kept parents informed about other issues on her online blog , but said she started receiving abusive messages after inviting a fellow parent to sell cakes priced between 10p and 20p to pupils as a treat at break - time on fridays			1
a group of parents have allegedly now threatened to smoke in a ‘ picket line ’ outside the school gates			1
they had also vowed in online messages to ‘ smash up the van ’ the parent sold the cakes from after they were branded ‘ unhealthy ’			0
mrs @entity1 , 53 , said she was shocked when she saw the petition and did not expect it at the school , because it was much more ‘ middle - class ’ than the one she ran before			1
she said : ‘ i was prepared for some resistance but not the nastiness and threats			0
i just want to make sure the children do well			0
' all this unpleasantness is a handful of parents			2
i think for a long time they have been allowed to bully the other parents , so it was time to take a stand			2
' when this happened it did make me initially think “ why am i doing this ? ” , but i ’m quite stubborn			0
‘ this problem needs to be resolved			0
we promote responsible behaviour and i would not tolerate bullying from the pupils or my staff so why should i from some of the parents ? ' i think the best way to deal with bullying is to expose it and have it discussed out in the open			2
that is why i put it on the blog			0
‘ i think any parent has the right to smoke			0
however , i asked parents not to outside the school gates as it ’s a narrow road and a lot of other parents who were arriving with buggies were complaining about the smoke they could not escape			1
‘ some of my methods , like discipline , have been viewed as old - fashioned , but it is done in a forward - thinking way to better the school			2
’ the anonymous petition was brought into school after one was put through the letterbox of a teacher ’s home			2
parents of pupils at @entity14 in @entity25 have launched a campaign of abuse after being asked to refrain from smoking at the school 's gates some parents have also complained they have received them through their doors overnight			1
despite the abuse , mrs @entity1 said she had no intention of closing the online blog , which has been popular at her former school , @entity116 , in @entity117 , where she remains executive head			1
since she took over @entity116 in 2007 it has rocketed up @entity122 borough ’s league table and is one of the top performing schools in the area			0
in her drive to improve @entity128 primary quickly , mrs @entity1 introduced lunchtime detentions for children who turned up late for classes , forgot their pe kit , misbehaved or did not complete their work to the correct standard in lessons			1
she said school tardiness had dropped by a half once parents realised that for every minute their child was late they would spend two minutes in detention			2
@entity141 , 28 , who now smokes away from the school while waiting for her child to finish for the day , said : ‘ the new head has only been here for a few weeks and things are already so much better			2
‘ my little boy got a detention for doing one sentence in 20 minutes			0
i know he can do more than that			0
' he has n’t done it since because he knows if he does n’t do his work , he ’s staying in at lunchtime			0
‘ he ’s only seven , he ’s probably a bit too young to understand , but it has worked			0
i did n’t realise how bad some of the parents were until all this came out			0

@entity1 was sent to @entity14 in @entity25 to improve standards
female headteacher and her deputy have become victims of hate campaign after introducing new *rules*
mrs @entity1 had already improved lateness and discipline at school before receiving abuse from parents
