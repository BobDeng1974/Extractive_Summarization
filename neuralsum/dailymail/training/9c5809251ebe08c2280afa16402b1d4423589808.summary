by @entity0 published : 11:58 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 13:03 est , 26 february 2013 @entity1 is set to release a new miniaturised version of its ground - breaking @entity4 console in the @entity5 in just a month 's time			1
the @entity8 video game maker , which has sold nearly 100 million @entity4 consoles worldwide , today announced the scaled - down version of the machine will hit the @entity5 high street on march 24			1
smaller than the original @entity4 - which has since been superseded by the @entity14 - the @entity13 will come in matte black with a red border			1
' savagely compromised version of the original hardware ' : @entity1 is set to launch its @entity19 in the @entity5 next month , but the slimmed down version of their last - generation console has already been savaged by video gamers no price has yet been announced , but it is currently on the market in @entity27 for the budget price of $ 99 cad ( around £ 63 )			1
@entity1 also announced that it would be expanding its discounted range of @entity31 games with @entity32 8 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			0
however , video games websites have already laid in to the slimmed down machine , with one describing it as a ' savagely compromised version of the original hardware '			0
the original @entity4 : launched in 2007 , nearly 100million of the consoles have since been sold worldwide @entity1 became a household name in the @entity42 with its first console , the @entity44 , popularly known as the @entity44			1
its star shone brighter with the subsequent @entity46 , or @entity46 , but the subsequent entry of big hitters like @entity49 and @entity50 into the video games market proved a challenge for the company			0
@entity56 arch - rival @entity54 was beaten out of the console market altogether and @entity1 found itself occupying a younger niche as adult gamers turned to the more sophisticated @entity60 and @entity61			2
the @entity4 , released in 2007 , broke new ground with its motion - sensitive controllers , however , allowing @entity1 to market the first video games which could be controlled by the movement of players ' bodies			2
in a statement today , @entity1 said : ' with a family - friendly design offering no internet capabilities , @entity19 allows you to jump straight in and experience all the great @entity4 games from the last six years since the @entity4 console first launched			1
' to coincide with the launch of @entity19 , @entity1 is also adding to the existing range of @entity31 titles , offering great value for everyone to enjoy classic @entity4 games			2
' since 1983 , when it launched the @entity44 , @entity1 has sold more than 4billion video games and more than 651 million hardware units globally			0
it has also created industry icons that have become well - known , household names such as @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88			0
however , video games industry observers have criticised the release of the @entity19 as something of a misstep by @entity1			2
@entity1 's @entity14 console : @entity1 has returned to the black for the first nine months of its business year and more than doubled its profit forecast for the full year , despite pessimism about sales prospects in a product review of the console , @entity101 , writing for @entity102 , said : ' what we have here is a crippled version of a six - year - old console that offers the absolute base level of functionality - and nothing more			1
' he added : ' unfortunately , the sad reality is that the @entity19 disappoints on almost every level			0
' it 's not a good - looking piece of kit at all , functionality has been stripped down to the absolute bare - bones , and perhaps worst of all for a product actively being marketed on its dinky form - factor is the fact that it 's not actually that much smaller than the original model			0
' it emerged today that @entity1 had returned to the black for the first nine months of its business year and more than doubled its profit forecast for the full year , despite pessimism about sales prospects .			0
