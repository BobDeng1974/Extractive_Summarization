campaigners are furious the government has rejected proposals to relax the system which forces a bereaved wife to give up her pension if she enters a new relationship			0
up to 400 widows have had their pensions seized in the past year because of the ‘ obscene ’ rule and another 1,000 face losing their retirement pot next year			1
the @entity26 accused the @entity27 of breaking the military covenant – which sets out the nation ’s duty of care to the @entity5			1
air marshal sir @entity32 , chairman of the fps , said the decision had ‘ given our widows a slap in the face for @entity37 ’			1
he added : ‘ any government that thinks it is right to leave a service widow with the cruel dilemma of having to give up her income or give up a new love should be deeply ashamed of itself			0
‘ it ’s an obscenity in modern society			0
decent women with a natural human need for love and partnership are being turned into criminals			1
’ the rule applies to the old @entity5 pension scheme and states that if a widow finds new love , marries or cohabits she will forfeit her retirement fund			1
it excludes widows of soldiers killed in action			2
despite a new system introduced in 2005 , allowing widows to keep their income if they remarry , around 150,000 ex-servicemen are still part of the older scheme			2
sir @entity32 said many women had sacrificed their careers because of their husband ’s work in the @entity5 and had been unable to build their own pension pots			1
he added : ‘ this is intolerable – the cost of ceasing this practice is negligible , the hardship in continuing it unbearable			0

‘ i could not pursue a career , and it was difficult bringing up children whilst constantly on the move			0
i am a dependant … i may as well be living in @entity92			0
’ @entity93 , of the @entity94 , described the rule as ‘ dickensian ’ but the @entity96 said it was a ‘ fundamental principle … that pensions should not be improved retrospectively for those who are no longer contributing members ’ .			0
