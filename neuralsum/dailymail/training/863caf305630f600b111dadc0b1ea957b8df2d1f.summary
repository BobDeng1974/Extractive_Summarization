they are accused of falsifying records to cover up poor care at the @entity10 in @entity11 , south @entity12			1
the hospital is already at the centre of an investigation following the death of former miner @entity16 , 58 – who was forced to remain in a queuing ambulance			1
the nurses are accused of falsifying records to cover up poor care at the @entity10 in @entity11 , south @entity12 ( pictured ) and there are fears that problems are continuing at the hospital - where only last thursday queues of up to 14 ambulances were seen outside its @entity26			1
the arrests came as campaigners demanded urgent action over mounting claims of ‘ cruelty ’ and ‘ unnecessary suffering ’ at the hospital			2
an independent review has now been ordered by the @entity35 into the claims			0
last night a whistleblower said she had been ignored when she raised concerns about poor care – and that reports she filed about dangerous incidents went missing			1
former nurse @entity41 said she saw a room being poorly cleaned , a dementia patient being roughly handled and a patient given the wrong medication			0
‘ i would fill out an incident form and later be told they had no record of it , ’ she said			0
‘ i have kept copies of them so i have them			0
an internal investigation found there was not enough evidence to support my claims and in the end it all became too stressful			0
‘ i want to speak out because i want these people to be held to account and to stop these mistakes happening again and again			0
’ former nurse @entity41 - @entity59 mrs @entity61 , who worked at the @entity10 for eight years and left in 2009 , is now involved in tribunal proceedings against the @entity64 health board			2

‘ this was in response to serious complaints about care provided to some patients ; critical ombudsman ’s reports ; mortality rates , and a police investigation into allegations of falsification of records by some of our nurses			1
