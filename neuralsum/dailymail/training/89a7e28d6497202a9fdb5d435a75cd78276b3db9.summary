by @entity0 published : 11:17 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 12:26 est , 25 october 2013 a @entity2 engineer has created an electric superbike made of lightweight carbon fibre that can reach speeds of 150mph and go from 0 to 60 in just three seconds			2
his aim is to create the ultimate eco bike that outperforms traditional , petrol guzzling superbikes on performance and driving experience			0
the @entity14 bike features a two - wheeled electric propulsion system and claims to the the most advanced and fastest street - legal electric motorbike in the world			1
the company , based in @entity27 , says the bike has ' unprecedented levels of control and performance never seen before in any electric vehicle			2
' but it also has as hefty price tag of $ 72,499 , or £ 44,700 , and only 40 are being produced			0
the bike has a 120kw electric motor combined with an ' @entity38 ' powertrain , which gives the vehicle 160 brake horsepower the super bike also boasts ' @entity42 ' - a user interface that lets a driver access an on - board gps system , @entity46 and an image - stabilised hd camera , as well as the usual readings ( pictured ) via an @entity47 touchscreen the super bike is devoid of pistons , crankshaft , clutch and other mechanical parts rotating at thousands of rounds per minute and is almost silent			1
without the inertial forces created by hundreds of heavy spinning machine parts , the @entity14 ' drops into corners ' easily and its linear power delivery system means the driver does not need to bother with using a clutch and gearbox			2
a custom - built chassis means the bike can be as agile as a superbike , while still having ' straight line stability '			0
the super bike is devoid of pistons , crankshaft , clutch , and other mechanical parts rotating at thousands of rounds per minute and is almost silent the super bike also boasts ' @entity42 ' - a smart user interface that integrates mobile phone applications and has a high resolution touch screen			1
it lets a driver access an on - board gps system , @entity46 and an image - stabilised hd camera			1
the company said : ' seamlessly integrating turn - by - turn navigation , communications , controls , track mode and ride telemetry data , @entity42 rewrites the current expectations of motorcycle and rider interaction			0
' a custom - built chassis means the bike can be as agile as a superbike , while still having ' straight line stability , ' according to the company			0

the @entity14 bike features a two - wheeled electric propulsion system and is the *brainchild* of an engineer based in @entity27
it claims to be the fastest and most advanced street - legal electric motorbikes in the world but costs over £ 44,000
a clever user interface lets the driver access an on - board gps system , @entity46 and an image - stabilised hd camera via an @entity47 touchscreen
