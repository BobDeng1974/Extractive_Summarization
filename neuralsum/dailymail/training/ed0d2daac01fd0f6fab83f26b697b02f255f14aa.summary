a tiny , remote - controlled camera has been lowered into an early @entity2 tomb that has been sealed for 1,500 years			1
@entity4 footage of the tomb at the @entity7 archaeological site in southern @entity8 revealed an apparently intact funeral chamber with red frescoes , pottery and pieces of a funerary shroud made of jade and mother of pearl			1
it also showed a series of nine figures depicted in black on a vivid , blood - red background			1
archaeologists say the images from one of the earliest ruler 's tombs found at @entity7 will shed new light on the early years of the once - great city state			2
unseen for 1,500 years : scientists lowered a tiny camera into the @entity2 tomb at the archaeological site in @entity7 , southern @entity8			1
amazingly , red paint still remains on the walls intact : the footage revealed a funeral chamber with red frescoes , pottery and pieces of a shroud made of jade and mother of pearl @entity7 was a @entity45 city state in what is now the @entity48 state of @entity49 the @entity50 said archaeologists have known about the tomb since 1999 , but have been unable to enter it because the pyramid standing above it is unstable and breaking into the chamber could damage the murals			1
it said the floor appears to be covered with detritus and it is not immediately evident in the footage if the tomb contains recognisable remains			1
but archaeologist @entity63 said the jade and shell fragments seen on the video are ' part of a funerary costume '			0
the chamber was found in a heavily - deteriorated pyramid complex known as the @entity71 , in a jungle - covered area of @entity7 not far from the @entity73 , where the tomb of a later ruler , @entity75 , was found in the 1950s			1
while @entity75 's tomb featured a famous and heavily carved sarcophagus , no such structure is seen in the footage of the tomb released yesterday			1
the institute said in a statement that ' it is very probable that the fragmented bones are lying directly on the stones of the floor '			0
but dr @entity63 said the discovery shed new light on early rulers , and its proximity to other burial sites suggested the tomb may be part of a funerary complex			2
' all this leads us to consider that the @entity71 was used as a royal necropolis during that period , ' she said			0
the floor of the tomb appears to be covered with detritus			2
it was not immediately evident in the footage if the tomb contains recognisable remains the chamber was found in a heavily - deteriorated pyramid complex known as the @entity71 , within @entity7 @entity108 , an associate professor of anthropology at the @entity110 who was not involved in the project , said ' this is an important find for @entity7 and for understanding @entity114 history and politics '			1
this was in part , she explained , because the later rulers who made the city - state larger tended to build atop their predecessors ' temples and tombs , making it hard to get at them			0
' @entity7 was a relatively important western @entity45 capital in the @entity114 , but with the build - up during the time of @entity75 and some of his successors , those accomplishments were buried and thus difficult to assess , buried literally by @entity131 structures atop @entity114 ones , ' @entity108 said			0
the later rulers wrote almost obsessively about @entity7 's history in long stone inscriptions , but @entity108 noted that ' finding archaeological confirmation of the earlier kings has been extremely difficult '			0
the tomb 's floor occupies about five square metres with a low , @entity2 - arch roof of overlapping stones			2
experts say it probably dates to between 431 and 550 ad , and could contain the remains of @entity145 ' @entity144 , the first ruler of the city - state			0
the entrance to the tomb			0
inside , its floor occupies about five square metres with a low , @entity2 - arch roof of overlapping stones archaeologists have known about the tomb of a @entity2 ruler at @entity7 since 1999 , but have only just developed the technology to be able to explore it the tomb 's existence was revealed by a shaft found near the top of the ruined pyramid , leading downward			1
but it was too narrow to provide any kind of view of the chamber			0
in late april , researchers lowered the tiny 2in - long camera into the tomb using the 6in - wide shaft			2
while the general public had not seen images of the interior of the tomb , video of it was made after the chamber was detected in 1999 , noted @entity177 , a specialist in @entity2 epigraphy at the @entity179			2
the images had circulated among researchers and been posted on the internet , and dr @entity177 said that some evidence suggests the tomb " is the burial of a noted female ruler of @entity7 named @entity186 , based on the date and on the identities of ancestral figures painted on the walls			0
' ' the female ruler is mentioned in a number of the historical texts of the site , ' he wrote			0
it would not be the first tomb of a female noble found at @entity7 - in 1994 , archaeologists found the tomb of a woman dubbed the red queen because of the red pigment covering her tomb			1
but it has never been established that she was a ruler of @entity7 , and her tomb dates from a later period , between 600 and 700 ad			0

footage of the tomb in southern @entity8 revealed an apparently intact funeral chamber still covered in blood - red paint
