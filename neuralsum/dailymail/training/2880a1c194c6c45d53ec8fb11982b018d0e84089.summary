it should be a no - brainer but then the same ought to have applied to the @entity2 learning his lesson			0
surely @entity5 , complete with the luxurious skills of new kid on the @entity8 block @entity9 , will beat @entity10 , minus the penetration of bitter old @entity12			1
that is what pretty much everyone except @entity12 ’s countrymen seem to want the outcome to be on this first day of the round of the last 16			1
while @entity12 left the revulsion of @entity20 2014 for a warped hero ’s welcome in @entity22 , the @entity18 was making ready to admire the refreshing @entity23			1
but there is a danger here			0
in fact that entire @entity39 country is shutting out criticism of @entity12 the serial biter			1
even their president is rallying behind him despite it being this man himself – not the @entity59 media , a @entity61 conspiracy or anything else they care to blame – who has shot his team in the foot			0
how will the players he has left behind react ? if they feel sorry for themselves , they will be soft pickings for @entity5			1
but the indications are that they are angry about their star striker being expelled from the tournament and are bristling to make a statement			2
passionate : supporters waited at @entity43 to greet the arrival of @entity12 speaking his mind : @entity5 manager @entity26 addresses the media at a press conference working out : @entity5 forward @entity81 ( left ) and defender @entity82 during training there are times when there is a sinister side to @entity10			1
their best teams – starting with the two - time @entity8 winners back in the 1950s – create beautiful memories			2
but when it goes against them they can , as @entity12 so sharply demonstrates , leave a sour taste in the mouth			1
either way , they are never easy meat			0
@entity5 are one of the pleasant surprises here			2
their attacking football has captured the imagination			0
@entity105 is an international legend in the making and it helps that he has @entity81 to help carry the goalscoring burden			0
@entity109 is not too shabby , either			0
but they should take nothing for granted			0
dangerman : @entity5 playmaker @entity9 goes for a jog during a training session in @entity115 eyes on the prize : @entity118 ( left ) , @entity119 and @entity120 ( right ) during training if ever there will be a moment for @entity125 to explain to a wider audience outside @entity127 why @entity128 invested a fortune in him , this is it			1
@entity125 , with his flamboyant style , often flatters to deceive but @entity10 need him to fill the goal void now			2
the enforced absence of @entity12 also gives veteran forward @entity135 another day in the @entity8 sunshine			2
the @entity137 , as usual when the @entity8 is played on this continent , have been prospering but one of them has to go out			0
stepping up : @entity125 joins in with a training session on the eve of the game against @entity5 uphill task : @entity10 know they are underdogs against @entity5 without star striker @entity12 hugs all round : @entity135 could have a bigger role to play for @entity10 in @entity12 's absence it is worth @entity5 reminding themselves that @entity10 were deeply unimpressive in qualifying , reaching @entity20 only courtesy of a ridiculously easy play off against @entity153			1
hindsight tells us , also , that the group in which they defeated both @entity158 and @entity159 was nothing like as strong as we fondly imagined			0
@entity161 are living proof of that			0
the grand stage of the @entity18 is set for @entity9 to give most of the world what it wants from this match			1
but with @entity10 in this defiant mood , the 22 - year - old prodigy must not expect a gentle ride .			2

@entity5 face @entity10 in second round clash in @entity115
@entity32 winners enter as favourites for all @entity39 match
@entity5 won all three group games beating @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182
