former @entity1 managing director @entity0 has filed a ‘ deceit ’ claim in the @entity3 against five parties including @entity5 , the @entity6 bank that still controls 25 per cent of the @entity9 club ’s shares			1
the claim surrounds the circumstances in which @entity0 was invited to @entity13 in may on the apparent prospect of a new job , only to be arrested and accused by @entity5 of large - scale fraud and embezzlement			1
@entity0 has since spent 140 days in a @entity13 police station without being charged			2
@entity0 has filed a ' deceit ' claim in the high court against five parties , including @entity5 @entity0 ’s claim is against @entity5 as well as @entity5 ’s @entity13 subsidiary , @entity5 , plus three individuals who work for those companies , and is detailed in papers lodged at the @entity3 on friday , seen by @entity27			1
immediate repercussions for @entity1 as a football club are likely to range from small to none at all			0
the longer - term implications are less easy to predict as a current co-owning party ( @entity5 ) and a former @entity33 ( @entity0 ) ramp up an increasingly acrimonious legal and pr war that threatens to be costly and damaging to one or both of them			2
@entity5 have successfully had all @entity0 ’s assets frozen globally as they pursue claims against him for almost £ 4million , money they allege @entity0 stole using falsified invoices			1
the former managing director of @entity1 , @entity0 , with the club 's former owner , @entity41 @entity0 said via a spokesman today : ‘ i have been wrongly and unscrupulously held in jail for almost five months on false pretences			1
this is wrong and an abuse of my human rights			0
‘ after many months of being frustrated in my attempts to defend myself , my legal team will shortly be ready to file a full defence and my own claims against @entity5 – which will be considerably larger than those they have laid against me			0
’ @entity5 responded by saying they have not been served with any claim by @entity0			2
this claim appears to be true in as much as no physical documents have been delivered , yet , to either @entity13 or @entity6			0
a legal process has undoubtedly been started , however , as the claim document has been stamped at the @entity3			0
@entity0 ( right ) has enlisted the services of forensic investigators in a bid to clear his name @entity5 say : ‘ contrary to the statement that has been issued by @entity0 today , no claim by @entity0 has yet been served on @entity5 or any other party			2
‘ until a particularised claim has been received it is therefore impossible to give any comment on any such claim			0
it is clear that this statement is in reality just another blatant attempt by mr @entity0 to attract attention in circumstances where @entity5 maintains its claims of fraud against mr @entity0 in the [ @entity13 ] court			1
’ asked to clarify whether @entity5 are aware of the claim papers issued in the @entity3 , a spokesman added : ‘ yes , but they have not been served and there are no particulars			0
