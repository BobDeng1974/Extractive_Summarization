three months after a @entity4 student was mauled to death by a 302 - pound bear , the state 's final of five scheduled bear hunts is set for this week			1
state wildlife officials and activists disagree over whether the hunts are needed to control the bruin population or are an inhumane practice that does n't address public safety			1
while the overall numbers of bears in the state has decreased since the state instituted the hunt in 2010 , some point to @entity20 's death as evidence that there is too much focus on killing the animals and not enough on educating the public about how to handle interactions with them			1
' the fact that we had a person killed despite having a hunt shows it is not working , ' said @entity32 , director of the @entity33 in @entity34			1
controversial : @entity35 , with @entity34 's @entity36 , weighs a 346 pound male bear on the first day of the last of @entity34 's five state - sponsored bear hunts second - year @entity4 student @entity20 , 22 , ( left ) was mauled to death by a bear in september			1
police revealed that he took pictures of the animal as it approached ( right ) tensions : @entity46 , of @entity47 , @entity34 , stands next to the corpse			2
wildlife officials and opponents of the hunt sparred over whether the hunt has been effective and should be renewed @entity20 was hiking in the @entity53 with four friends when they noticed a 300 - pound black bear following them			1
the group scattered , and @entity20 's friends , who were not injured , called police when they realized he was missing			2
@entity32 said non-lethal methods such as aversion therapy to make bears afraid of people and teaching people how to bear - proof houses and yards are effective			1
he also stressed the need for warning signs : there were no signs notifying hikers that bears reside in the area of the @entity53 or lists of do 's and don'ts about bear confrontations			1
photos released by police show @entity20 took pictures of the bear with his cellphone before being attacked			1
about 1,600 bears have been killed in the last four hunts , according to the @entity84			1
in 2010 , there were 3,400 bears living north of @entity88 , roughly in the upper one - eighth of the state , according to a state @entity92 report that supported the resumption of the bear hunt , in part to ensure public safety			2
the @entity84 estimates there are about 2,500 bears in that area now			2
only 251 bears were killed last year , a nearly 60 percent drop from the 592 killed in 2010			2
freezing rain and bad weather hampered hunters on the first day of the hunt			0
@entity107 , principal biologist and leader of the @entity110 's black bear project , said the @entity84 may recommend holding future hunts earlier in the fall to avoid potentially disruptive weather , and extending the length of the hunt			0
deaths : about 1,600 bears have been killed in the last four hunts , according to the state @entity84 only 251 bears were killed last year , a nearly 60 percent drop from the 592 killed in 2010			1
freezing rain and bad weather hampered hunters on the first day of the hunt ' as a general rule we have slowed the population , but that does n't mean we are done , ' he said			0
' we need to make sure we 're managing the population on more of a statewide level			0
the hunt is effective , but it is n't effective as it could be			0
' the number of reports of aggressive bears has dropped , but with some caveats			0
reports of category 1 bears , defined as bruins that are aggressive and a danger to humans or livestock , fell from 235 in 2010 to 129 in 2013			2
while home entries and attempted entries fell from 90 in 2010 to 33 last year , they have risen to 44 through late november			0
in addition , reports of bears killing livestock rose from 21 to 35 between 2012 and 2013			0
that could bolster @entity107 ' contention that while the bear population is falling in the more heavily forested areas in western and northwestern @entity34 , bears may be proliferating in areas where hunting is prohibited or restricted , such as in some state parks or nature conservancies that border residential areas			2
carried away : a truck with a dead bear leaves a bear hunt check - in station at the @entity162 watching : as he waits at a check - in station , @entity163 looks at the 134 - pound female bear that he killed at around 7:30am on the first day of the hunt			0
bears have been seen in all 21 @entity34 counties the @entity92 report in 2010 concluded that efforts to educate people about bear - proofing their garbage systems had been effective , as inspections of 4,600 residential properties had found 98 percent in compliance with bear management guidelines			0
it noted , though , that ' the expense of bear - resistant garbage cans and commercial containers has hampered their widespread use			0
' bears have been seen in all 21 @entity34 counties , according to the @entity84 the hunts draw animal rights protesters , who have called for the state to ban allowing hunters from baiting bears			1
@entity188 , executive director of the @entity189 of @entity34 , said at a statehouse rally thursday that baiting is inhumane and counterproductive because it changes the animals ' natural foraging patterns and attracts them to other human food supplies			0
she and others at the rally called on lawmakers to support a bill that would ban baiting and require other ' bear smart ' measures , such as bear - proof trash containers and bans on birdseed in areas populated by bears .			0
