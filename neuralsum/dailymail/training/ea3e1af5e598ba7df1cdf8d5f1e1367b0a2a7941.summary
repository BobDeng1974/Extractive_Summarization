by @entity1 reporter published : 20:13 est , 2 november 2013 updated : 06:51 est , 3 november 2013 @entity2 liked the health insurance he purchased for himself and his wife three years ago and thought he 'd be able to keep the plan even after the federal @entity6 took effect			1
but the 64 - year - old recently received a letter notifying him the plan was being canceled because it did n't cover certain benefits required under the law			1
the @entity13 , who live near @entity15 , pay $ 770 monthly for their soon - to - be - terminated health care plan with a $ 2,500 deductible			1
cancelled : @entity2 and @entity18 , of @entity19 , @entity20 , are among millions of people nationwide who buy individual insurance policies and are receiving notices that those policies are being discontinued the cheapest plan they found on their state insurance exchange was a so - called bronze plan charging a $ 1,275 monthly premium with deductibles totaling $ 12,700			1
it covers only providers in @entity20 , so the couple , who live near @entity36 , wo n't be able to see doctors they 've used for more than a decade			1
‘ we 're buying insurance that we will never use and ca n't possibly ever benefit from			1
we 're basically passing on a benefit to other people who are not otherwise able to buy basic insurance , ’ said @entity2 , who is retired from running an information technology company			1
the @entity13 are among millions of people nationwide who buy individual insurance policies and are receiving notices that those policies are being discontinued because they do n't meet the higher benefit requirements of the new law			1
they can buy different policies directly from insurers for 2014 or sign up for plans on state insurance exchanges			1
while lower - income people could see lower costs because of government subsidies , many in the middle class may get rude awakenings when they access the websites and realize they 'll have to pay significantly more			1
frustrated : the plan they found on their state insurance exchange only covers providers in @entity20 , so the couple , who live near @entity36 , wo n't be able to see doctors they 've used for more than a decade those not eligible for subsidies generally receive more comprehensive coverage than they had under their soon - to - be - canceled policies , but they 'll have to pay a lot more			1
because of the higher cost , the @entity13 are considering paying the federal penalty - about $ 100 or 1 per cent of income next year - rather than buying health insurance			1
they say they are healthy and do n't typically run up large health care costs			0
@entity2 said that will be cheaper because it 's unlikely they will get past the nearly $ 13,000 deductible for the coverage to kick in			1
individual health insurance policies are being canceled because the @entity6 requires plans to cover certain benefits , such as maternity care , hospital visits and mental illness			1
the law also caps annual out - of - pocket costs consumers will pay each year			1
in the past , consumers could get relatively inexpensive , bare - bones coverage , but those plans will no longer be available			1
many consumers are frustrated by what they call forced upgrades as they 're pushed into plans with coverage options they do n't necessarily want			1
@entity102 , who manages a fast food restaurant in @entity104 , @entity105 , is recovering from sticker shock after the small - business policy offered by his employer was canceled for the same reasons individual policies are being discontinued			1
his company pays about $ 100 monthly for his basic health plan			1
he said he 'll now have to pay $ 600 monthly for a mid-tier silver plan on the state exchange			2
the family policy also covers his 8 - year - old son			2
' forced upgrades : many say they feel forced into taking plans through the @entity6 website that they do n't need even though the federal government is contributing a $ 500 subsidy , he said the $ 600 he 's left to pay is too high			1
he 's considering the penalty			2
‘ i feel like they 're forcing me to do something that i do n't want to do or need to do , ’ @entity102 , 40 , said			0
owners of canceled policies have a few options			0
they can stay in the same plan for the same price for one more year if they have one of the few plans that were grandfathered in			0
they can buy a similar plan with upgraded benefits that meets the new standards - likely at a significant cost increase			2
or , if they make less than $ 45,960 for a single adult or $ 94,200 for a family of four , they may qualify for subsidies			0
just because a policy does n't comply with the law does n't mean consumers will get cancellation letters			2
they may get notices saying existing policies are being amended with new benefits and will come with higher premiums			2
some states , including @entity152 and @entity153 , required insurers to cancel old policies and start from scratch instead of beefing up existing ones			2
it 's unclear how many individual plans are being canceled - no one agency keeps track			1
but it 's likely in the millions			0
advance notice : @entity164 , president of the market analysis firm @entity165 , says most policyholders in the individual market will receive some notice that their coverage will change insurance industry experts estimate that about 14 million people , or 5 per cent of the total market for health care coverage , buy individual policies			1
most people get coverage through jobs and are n't affected			0
many states require insurers to give consumers 90 days ' notice before canceling plans			1
that means another round of cancellation letters will go out in march and again in may			0
experts have n't been able to predict how many will pay more or less under the new , upgraded plans			2
an older policyholder with a pre-existing condition may find that premiums go down , and some will qualify for subsidies			0
in @entity194 , about 900,000 people are expected to lose existing plans , but about a third will be eligible for subsidies through the state exchange , covered @entity194 , said @entity199 , their spokeswoman			2
most canceled plans provided bare - bones coverage , she said			0
‘ they basically had plans that had gaping holes in the coverage			0
they would be surprised when they get to the emergency room or the doctor 's office , some of them did n't have drug coverage or preventive care , ’ @entity199 said			0
the cancellations run counter to one of president @entity217 's promises about his health care overhaul : ' if you like your health care plan , you 'll be able to keep your health care plan ' about 330,000 @entity222 received cancellation notices from the state 's largest insurer , @entity224			2
about 30,000 have plans that were grandfathered in			0
@entity228 insurance officials said they 're not tracking the number of canceled policies related to the new law			2
national numbers are similar : 130,000 cancellations in @entity153 , 140,000 in @entity234 and as many as 400,000 in @entity235 , according to officials in those states			0
@entity239 has sent thousands of cancellation letters to @entity242 policyholders but stressed that 99 percent have the option of renewing their 2013 policy for one more year , company spokesman @entity238 said			0
cancellation letters are being sent only to individuals and families who purchase their own insurance			0
however , most policyholders in the individual market will receive some notice that their coverage will change , said @entity164 , president of the market analysis firm @entity165			0
the cancellations run counter to one of president @entity217 's promises about his health care overhaul : ‘ if you like your health care plan , you 'll be able to keep your health care plan			0
’ @entity262 , 47 , of @entity263 , @entity264 , was shocked when his cancellation notice arrived last month			0
the gift - shop owner said he 'd spent years arranging doctors covered by his insurer for him , his wife and their two college - age students			0
after browsing the state exchange , he said he thinks he 'll end up paying lower premiums but higher deductibles			2
he said the website did n't answer many of his questions , such as which doctors take which plans			0
‘ i was furious because i spent a lot of time and picked a plan that all my doctors accepted , ’ @entity262 said			0
‘ now i do n't know what doctors are going to take what			0
no one mentioned that for the last three years when they talked about how this was going to work			0
