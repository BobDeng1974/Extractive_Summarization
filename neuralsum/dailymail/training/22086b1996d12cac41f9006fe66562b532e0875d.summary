online check - in has made it easier to reserve your place on a fight , but it ca n’t stop the dreaded bag drop queues when you arrive at the airport			0
in a bid to solve this , @entity7 and @entity8 have created a digital tag , and tracking device that not only let you bypass this airport chore , but could also spell the end of lost luggage			1

the scheme will launch by the end of the year , but prices have not been announced in october , @entity32 began customer - trials of new re-useable digital bag - tags - similar to those unveiled by @entity7 and @entity8			1
the electronic bag - tag is used by passengers who have their booking details sent to a smartphone using the @entity32 app. under the scheme , passengers use their smartphone to check in , choose their seat and obtain their mobile boarding pass			0
the app then automatically updates the digital bag - tag with a unique barcode , containing flight details			2
the system consists of the @entity22 and @entity50			2
the @entity22 is fixed to suitcases and means travellers can drop off their luggage without having to re-label it each time they fly			0

once the devices are connected to a @entity18 account , flight details are updated when a new booking is made , and the tag is activated shortly before each journey			1
