by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:49 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 12:03 est , 20 august 2013 @entity4 's boss @entity3 knew about steroid use in the team but turned a blind eye because he had a ' win - at - any - cost ' attitude , explosive court papers claim			1
the papers were filed yesterday on behalf of @entity10 - who had an affair with @entity3 in 2011 and was later accused of stalking and extorting money from him to stay quiet about their relationship			2
the @entity17 native claims the @entity4 's boss told her about steroid use within the team and even named specific players			1
the papers also state that @entity3 admitted to her during ' pillow talk ' that he intentionally misled federal investigators during the @entity25 's investigation			0
demands : @entity10 filed legal papers in a bid to force @entity29 to drop @entity30 as his client allegations : explosive court papers say that @entity3 , right , knew about steroid use in the clubhouse and that @entity30 is a victim of a @entity4 ' take down ' ' mr @entity3 was ambivalent to the use of performance enhancing drugs so long as nothing came back to the @entity4 ’s organization , ' the papers state			1
' and shared with [ @entity41 ] his win - at - any - cost attitude			1
' ms @entity10 spent five months in @entity44 's @entity43 after she was arraigned on grand larceny , stalking and harassment charges in february 2012 relating to the affair			2
court papers filed on behalf of ms @entity10 's mother in january this year accused @entity3 of conspiring to have his former lover committed so their affair would never be revealed			2
ms @entity10 claims @entity30 is another victim of a yankee ' take - down '			1
' mr @entity30 and his current circumstance is consistent with a @entity4 management take - down , as was in the case of [ @entity41 ] , ' the papers state			1
the motion was filed to force @entity29 into ditching the @entity4 's player on the basis his legal firm , @entity63 & @entity64 , had a conflict of interest			1
ms @entity10 is being represented by @entity64 from the same law offices on a separate case in @entity68 , not related to the @entity3 affair			0
she claims @entity29 did not ask her permission when he agreed to represent @entity30 , who earlier this month was handed a 211 - match ban after he admitted to using performance enhancing drugs			1
ms @entity10 says she paid @entity64 $ 10,000 and gave him ' intimate details ' of her relationship with @entity3 and their conversations - some of which were about steroid use in the @entity4			1
bullish : @entity29 has hit back and accused ms @entity10 's lawyer of ' not knowing the facts ' of his own case @entity84 , who filed the latest papers on behalf of ms @entity10 , said as @entity3 ’s former lover she could be called to the stand in a forthcoming case involving the @entity4 's slugger			1
ms @entity10 's court papers claim : ' prior to @entity91 , @entity92 & @entity93 representing @entity30 , [ @entity41 ] was never contacted nor did [ she ] give informed consent so that @entity29 could represent what could be the differing interests [ of @entity10 and @entity30 ]			2
' @entity84 said : ' you do n’t drop a blue - collar client , who has paid a considerable amount of money , for a marquis client coming down the pipe unless you get informed consent			0
' but @entity29 hit back , arguing ms @entity10 had hired @entity64 ’s separate @entity68 firm , and not the @entity106 - based @entity105 - as her court papers claim - to represent her			2
centre stage : @entity109 was banned for 211 matches earlier this month after admitting to taking performance enhancing drugs while he was playing for the @entity114 @entity29 also noted that ms @entity10 was not ' dropped ' as a client by @entity64 ’s @entity68 firm			0
he pointed out @entity64 was still on retainer , adding @entity84 ' should not make statements when he does not know the facts of his own case '			0
@entity29 said : ' it ’s the most ridiculous motion i ’ve ever seen			0
even if they had gotten the law firm right , there is no conflict of interest			0
' i do n’t represent @entity3 , and i clearly do n’t represent the @entity4			0
their argument makes no sense			0
' but a legal expert told the @entity132 there does appears to be a conflict of interest , regardless of whether two firms are involved			0
' the problem is that the lawyer [ could ] be less than loyal to one client or the other , ' said @entity139 , a professor of law at @entity140 .			0
