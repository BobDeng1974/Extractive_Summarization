by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:18 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 14:03 est , 3 december 2013 @entity3 has been playing both sides of @entity6 's streets by making contributions to conservative political groups that have left - wingers seeing red , it emerged today			1
but the company is largely just looking out for itself			0
the tech giant 's grantees include @entity14 , a tea party - oriented organization that some pundits regard as the main catalyst for october 's partial government shutdown			2
another is @entity20 , led by conservative anti-tax crusader – and liberal nemesis – @entity23			0
the left - wing @entity24 claims that although @entity3 is ' supposedly guided by its " do n't be evil " motto , ' the normally reliably left - wing company has been ' funding a growing list of groups advancing the agenda of the @entity32 brothers			2
' that 's a reference to @entity0 and @entity32 , the billionaire scourges of liberals , who have contributed nearly $ 220 million to conservative and libertarian groups			2
@entity3 co-founder @entity37 is n't engaged in a secret plot to help @entity39 @entity3 has put millions into efforts to support an ' open ' @entity41 , pushing for so - called @entity43 laws designed to keep internet service providers from picking winners and losers in the public sphere but it appears that @entity3 's support for @entity39 - linked groups may not actually involve money changing hands			1
the @entity52 , the best - known libertarian group with national reach , told @entity54 that the company pays only for limited @entity3 ad buys			1
' they basically donate free advertising , ' said @entity52 communications vice president @entity59			2
' it amounts to $ 40,000 per month , ' she said in an email			0
' we use the grant to buy text ads on the @entity65 , promoting our research papers , blog posts , and op - eds , and have found that the ad buys are helpful in driving traffic to our site			0
' the anti-tax @entity23 would n't tell @entity54 if his group 's support from @entity3 was aimed at advocating for lower taxes on businesses – like @entity3			2
but @entity20 , he said , ' fights to reduce the 35 percent tax on @entity1 businesses – higher than the @entity79 average of 25 percent – and urges the @entity1 to move to a territorial tax system used by most nations in the world , ' @entity23 said			0
' the only disappointment is that some companies are not yet supporting @entity20 's efforts to restore @entity1 competitiveness			0
' territorial systems levy taxes on domestic income , but not foreign income			0
@entity3 and other companies essentially pay double when they earn income in other countries , since both those countries and the @entity1 tax those dollars			0
anti-tax crusader @entity23 's group likely caught @entity3 's eye because the company does n't like paying @entity1 taxes on money it earns overseas is @entity103 , one of the famed right - wing @entity32 brothers , secretly working with @entity3 ? not likely			1
it 's raining money : president @entity108 's re-election campaign took in more than $ 801,000 from @entity3 employees last year , indicating that the company 's rank - and - file is behind the @entity113 @entity112 @entity14 declined to answer questions about the nature of @entity3 's support			1
' we do n’t discuss donors , ' said the group 's communications director , @entity119			0
a @entity3 spokeswoman declined to provide a @entity123 blogger with details about its support for the organization			0
@entity14 is credited with pitting conservatives against moderate @entity39 in september , forcing disagreement about how to counter the @entity131 law – and ultimately leading to the shutdown in october			0
@entity3 says in on an online transparency report that its political action committee and philanthropic efforts are mainly oriented toward supporting an ' open @entity41 , ' free from over-regulation and ' controlled by no single organization , individual , or government			1
' despite the surprising dalliances with the political right documented in the transparency report , the company has spread its money to both the right and left for years			1
statistics compiled by the @entity146 show that @entity3 donated more to @entity39 congressional candidates than to @entity113 during the 2012 election cycle , and is repeating that pattern for 2014			1
but @entity3 's employees gave more than $ 801,000 last year to president @entity108 's re-election campaign , and another $ 622,000 to the @entity152			1
the @entity24 called its findings ' surprising , given @entity3 's public reputation on purportedly progressive issues other than privacy			1

a liberal group spun @entity3 's transparency report as a *bombshell* showing the company was *currying* favor with government - shutdown *cheerleaders*
one @entity3 grantee group advocates for tax *policies* that @entity3 likes
another got only free advertising that promoted ' open @entity41 ' rules that @entity3 favored
@entity3 supports @entity39 congressional candidates more than @entity113 , but its employees gave $ *1.4* million to @entity108 and the @entity152 last year
