@entity1 chief executive @entity0 has renewed his attack on the ‘ unprofessional ’ @entity3 and warned the ticketing row will lead to tensions among rival fans at @entity7			1
@entity8 , however , was immediately criticised by @entity10 supporters , who accused him of trying to stoke up controversy to mask his own failings in the fiasco			1
@entity16 have received an official allocation of 3,209 tickets for friday ’s crunch @entity20 qualifier — in line with @entity23 ’s five per cent minimum			1
@entity16 ceo @entity0 ( right ) hit out at the @entity3 over the handling of tickets @entity8 had demanded more but that was turned down by the @entity3 , who said there was no room for manoeuvre			1
visiting fans will be dotted throughout the @entity32 on friday night after acquiring tickets meant for @entity34 and @entity8 now feels there is the potential for trouble			1
‘ the @entity3 has really acted unprofessionally here with us , ’ he insisted			0
‘ they only gave us five per cent of the allocation , telling us the game was sold out when it ’s not			0
‘ it means we ’re not able to award tickets to hard - core supporters that we would love to accommodate			2
‘ the mannerly and common - sense thing to have done was give us 7,000 or 8,000 tickets and allow us to allocate them to @entity10 supporters in the one section			1
it was also be the safest thing to do ; i have to make that point			0
‘ @entity55 are playing well			1
this is a derby game , it ’s a friday night in @entity57 and there ’ll be tension in the air			2
to have pockets of @entity10 fans stuck in @entity34 areas is not the correct thing to do			1
‘ in my 10 years as chief executive , no association has treated us as badly as the @entity34 have done on this particular occasion			0
’ @entity16 fans are set to be among the home supporters at @entity7 after receiving a small allocation however , that standpoint cut little ice with frustrated @entity10 fans who insist the way the @entity1 have distributed their allocation is the real issue			1
a statement from supporters group @entity78 said @entity8 ’s comments were ‘ deeply unhelpful and do little more than stoke unnecessary tension ’			0
it added : ‘ both sets of fans have impeccable records for behaviour and have received awards from federations and other bodies for the support of their national sides			2
we expect both sets of spectators to contribute to a superb atmosphere on friday night			2
‘ once again the chief executive has seen fit to blame the @entity3 for this saga noting “ they only gave us five per cent of the allocation , telling us the game was sold out when it ’s not			0
it means we ’re not able to award tickets to hard - core supporters that we would love to accommodate ”			2
‘ @entity78 have clearly proved that the @entity1 system to allocate tickets spectacularly failed , irrespective of the size of the allocation			0
‘ many of the hardcore supporters that the chief executive mentions will be sitting with the @entity34 supporters are a result of the fact that the @entity1 have no clear and transparent system in place to allocate tickets			0
@entity55 train ahead of their crunch @entity20 qualifier against @entity16 ‘ these supporters have acquired “ home tickets ” for other games due to the same failures in @entity1 ticketing which occurred here			1
’ the @entity3 explained their position last week , stating : ‘ given the demand for tickets from @entity55 supporters , and the need to comply with @entity23 ’s safety and security regulations , we will be unable to increase the @entity16 ’s away allocation			1
’ however , former @entity16 manager @entity131 has sided with @entity8 and claimed the @entity3 will have to carry the can if there is any trouble at @entity7			1
‘ anything could happen during the match , ’ said @entity131			2
‘ if there is trouble on the night , they will be to blame			0
and they ’ll have to pay the price for that			0
i ca n’t understand why the @entity3 is doing this			0
‘ their fans will have to come over here			0
if the @entity1 behaved in the same way , the @entity34 fans would n’t get a fair deal either			0
we do n’t want any of that			0
but with @entity10 fans in the @entity34 sections , you just do n’t know what could happen			1

@entity16 were given 3,209 tickets for their qualifier against @entity55
but the visitors wanted as many as 8,000 tickets for the @entity7 clash
@entity10 fans are expected to be spread among the home fans on friday
former @entity16 boss @entity131 says any trouble will be @entity55 *'s* fault
