mr @entity0 first began the drugs after seeing how well they had worked for friends he trained with at the gym			1
while he had been working hard , he was n't seeing the same results as others			2
it was when friends told mr @entity0 that he would never achieve the results he wanted without the help of steroids , that he experimented for the first time			1
' my metabolism is apparently really fast , so i shed weight really quickly and it makes it really hard to maintain muscle mass , ' he said			0
' there were guys around me who did n't seem to be trying as hard as me but were getting much better gains			0
' i did n't even think about it			0
my next pay cheque that came in , i went to a friend of a friend and i ordered them in			0
' for most of these guys , they suffered no problems at all			2
' after starting taking anabolic steroids , mr @entity0 admits he became addicted to how his body reacted			1
' the difference was instant , ' he told @entity53			2
' i started noticing the gains immediately			1
you are supposed to do steroids in courses , but i saw myself getting bigger and bigger			1
' my arms toned up , my chest and back muscles were more defined and i went from a pretty average body to hench in a few weeks			1
' determined to get bigger and bigger , he began to up the dosage			1
' i started to do lots of different types of steroids - they call it stacking , ' he told @entity53			1
' i did n't really stop or give my body any kind of a break			0
' i 'd started to get chest pains quite frequently , but i just ignored them and kept going to the gym			1
' i did n't want to lose my new physique			0
' six months after first starting to take the drugs , mr @entity0 was on a night out , having a few drinks when he collapsed			1
' i became breathless , ' he told @entity53			2
' i started getting really hot and was sweating			2
' my chest went so tight and i got that feeling you hear about in my arm			2
it is hard to explain			0
' i did n't know what was happening to start with , it was similar to a panic attack			2
' but as my chest got tighter and tighter i realised what was happening to me			2
' everything went blurry and that 's all i remember , i blacked out			0
' the then 22 - year - old collapsed after six months of taking anabolic steroids to try and bulk up ( pictured ) doctors warned mr @entity0 if he continued to take the performance enhancing drugs he would die			1
he told @entity53 he made the decision there and then never to touch the drugs again when he woke up in a hospital bed , his girlfriend was holding his hand and crying			2
mr @entity0 spent five days in hospital while medics performed @entity100 tests and mri scans on him			1
' the doctors came in and informed me that i 'd had a heart attack , ' he recalled			1
' they said my the rate my heart was beating , i was lucky to be alive			2
' i 'd collapsed in the bar and an ambulance had brought me straight to hospital , and i 'd been unconscious since			1
' it was horrifying , ' he continued			0
' i have never experienced anything like it in my life and pray i never do again			0
' mr @entity0 spent five days in hospital , with doctors warning if he did n't give up the steroids , he was likely to die			1
' my heart was massive , ' he told @entity53			1
' it had swollen so much it was much bigger than normal			2
' and my blood pressure was through the roof			0
' it was while lying in his hospital bed that mr @entity0 made the decision - he vowed never to take the drugs again			1
' what you see , the results from taking the drugs , it 's addictive , ' he admitted			1
' it is n't very nice injecting them , you end up with a numb bum , but it is when you see in the mirror the results , and people start commenting on how big you look , that 's what becomes addictive			2
' despite this , mr @entity0 has stuck to his word , in the last two years not one steroid has been injected into his body			2
the drug steroids are drugs that mimic natural hormones that regulate and control how the body works and develops			2
there are two main groups - anabolic steroids and corticosteroids			1
anabolic steroids are the type widely misused			1
they are similar to the male hormone testosterone and can improve endurance and performance , as well as stimulate muscle growth			0
some people are tempted to take anabolic steroids to build their muscle mass , while others use them to improve their performance			1
the effects sports players and body builders have claimed the drugs help them : but they have also been known to the risks in the young , anabolic steroids can disrupt the way their body develops , stunting growth in some cases for men , the drugs can cause problems with erections , promote the growth of breasts and cause a man to become sterile			1
they can also cause men to lose their hair and develop acne , while others have suffered shrunken testicles			0
in women , the drugs can promote more masculine features			0
women have been known to develop facial hair , a deeper voice , lose hair on their heads , notice their breasts shrink			0
they may also suffer an enlarged clitoris , as well as acne , menstrual problems and changes in their sex drive			0
steroids also raise blood pressure , increasing the risk of illnesses including death from liver failure , stroke and heart attack			1
regular users have reported having trouble sleeping , becoming paranoid and experiencing dramatic mood swings			0
meanwhile , injecting drugs comes with its own risks , damaging veins , causing ulcers and gangrene			0
and injecting increases the risk of spreading @entity219 and @entity220 the law anabolic steroids are @entity224 drugs , which are sold by pharmacists but only with a doctor 's prescription			1
it is legal to possess or import steroids as long as they are for personal use			0
possession with intent to supply , including giving them to friends , is illegal and those found guilty face up to 14 years in prison			0
source : talk to @entity239 ' i feel very lucky and unlucky in many ways , ' he said			0
' i am lucky to be alive , but , while i was stupid , this kind of reaction does n't happen to everyone			0
' i am so grateful i did n't die , it was the wake up call i needed			0
' since his heart attack , mr @entity0 struggles to do proper work outs , fearing his heart ca n't cope			1
' i miss being big , ' he said			0
' but i could n't keep risking my life just for a few extra muscles			0
' if i was to use them again , doctors warned me i would n't last a month , my heart just ca n't take them			2
' he told @entity53 he is sharing his experience to warn others of the dangers			0
' a lot of people do steroids , ' he said			0
' i would advise never touching them , but you have to be realistic			0
' there will be people out there who use them , and to them i would just say , do n't abuse it			0
' there are safer ways of taking them			0
' mine is a horror story , but it was a wake up call for me and should be for others considering using the drugs			0

@entity0 was *envious* of the *muscular* bodies his gym friends had
the *labourer* started taking anabolic steroids when he was just 22
noticing the results immediately , he began to use more than the dosage
seeing his arms , back and chest getting bigger was ' addictive ' , he says
six months later , while on a night out , he suffered chest pain and collapsed
doctors told him he 'd had a heart attack and would die if he carried on
