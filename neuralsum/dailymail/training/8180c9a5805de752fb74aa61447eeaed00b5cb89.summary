@entity0 , the new education secretary , who will announce that toddlers are to be taught ' fundamental @entity3 values ' children as young as two are at risk of religious extremism and must be taught ' fundamental @entity3 values ' to combat radicalism , the new education secretary will warn today			1
@entity0 will urge local authorities to use new powers to strip funding from nurseries found to promote extremist views			1
also under the proposed rules , nurseries that teach creationism – the rejection of evolutionary theory – as scientific fact will also have their taxpayer funding cut			1
mrs @entity22 , who replaced @entity23 as @entity24 in last month ’s cabinet reshuffle , will say : ‘ one of the most important roles of the education system is that it should prepare young people for life in modern @entity3			1
‘ i am clear that public money should not be used to support any school or early years provider that does not support this aim because it seeks to promote ideas and teachings than run counter to fundamental @entity3 values			1
‘ there can be no place for extremist views anywhere in the education system			0
the changes we are making today will ensure all early years providers and schools are aligned with the need to protect children from views that are considered extreme			2
’ it is understood the teaching of @entity3 values is likely to include ‘ challenging negative attitudes and stereotypes ’			1
children will also be taught how to take turns and share and the difference between right and wrong			2
the announcement comes in the wake of the recent ‘ @entity65 ’ scandal , a hardline @entity61 plot to take over primary and secondary state schools in @entity64			1
mrs @entity22 hopes the rules will come into effect in the @entity68 following a consultation in september			0
@entity70 will inspect early years providers on promoting of fundamental @entity3 values			1
the proposals are designed to bring nurseries into line with similar tough measures in schools			1
it is the first time the government has warned that toddlers could be at risk from extremist views			2
mrs @entity22 is said to be worried about the risks of nurseries linked to radical mosques run by @entity61 hardliners			2
there are also concerns within @entity79 that councils need more power to respond if there are allegations of extremist views			0
the announcement follows a consultation on local authority early years funding arrangements			1
@entity98 , was an apparent plot by @entity61 fundamentalists to take over schools in the @entity101 , pictured , area there are currently no explicit rules that allow local authorities , which provide funding to nurseries that meet @entity70 requirements , to stop funding churches or mosques with extremist views			1
however , it is understood there is no concrete intelligence of any individual nurseries needing immediate action			0
a mysterious letter which described ‘ @entity98 ’ – an apparent plot by @entity61 fundamentalists to take over @entity64 ’s schools – sparked a series of school inspections in the city			1
it was passed to the council , head teachers , unions and media outlets , sparking four separate investigations			0
purportedly written as a guide for fellow hardliners in @entity131 , the unsigned and undated letter itself is now viewed as an elaborate hoax			0
however , @entity70 found evidence of an ‘ organised campaign ’ to change the character of some schools , while calling for further investigation of others			0
it inspected 21 schools in the city , concluding a ‘ culture of intimidation ’ had developed in some			0

takeover plot : @entity156 in @entity64 was at the centre of the allegations the so - called @entity65 plot first came to light earlier this year			1
@entity165 inspectors were ordered into @entity156 in @entity64 along with its sister schools , @entity145 and @entity163 , after a letter dubbed ' @entity65 ' - now thought to be a hoax - was uncovered			1
it allegedly outlined a plot by @entity61 hardliners to drive moderate headteachers out of schools			2
whistleblowers at @entity174 have claimed the school is in the hands of a group of extremists who infiltrated the governing body			0
it is alleged girls at the school were forced to sit at the back of the classroom and @entity186 pupils forced to teach themselves at the state school			2
the letter prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the @entity165 ( @entity165 ) and @entity70 in to the school and several others in the area			0
police , the government and school inspectors are thought to be investigating alleged attempts by radicals to seize control of 20 schools in the city after claims of plot emerged in march			2
the @entity165 has also appointed its own education commissioner , the former head of the @entity194 ’s counter-terrorism unit @entity205 for the investigation			0
yesterday , six schools at the centre of an alleged @entity211 takeover plot are facing radical reform and even closure after being officially judged as failing , it emerged last night			2
a three - month inquiry has found the @entity64 schools did too little to protect children from extremism and female staff were intimidated			1
one of the six , @entity145 , was rated ‘ inadequate ’ in every criteria			0
