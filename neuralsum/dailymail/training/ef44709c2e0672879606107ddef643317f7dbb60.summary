@entity18 at @entity19 with their restored @entity8			1
they have been working on the vehicle for more than 20 years chief engineer @entity23 drives the @entity18			2
the team believe it will pass its @entity10 within a month it was made in 1899 and is one of the oldest working cars in @entity7 , having spent 77 years in this country			1
the engineers have been working since 1991 , and are now based at @entity30 and @entity31 , near @entity32			2
they believe the car may be road worthy again in less than a month			1
the leader of @entity36 , @entity37 , wants the car to be kept in full working order so that the public can see a rare , genuine @entity42 car in all its glory			2
he said : ' we feel it 's a great privilege to be involved with the car and to play a part in preserving it for the future '			0

' @entity13 , co-founder of the @entity16 , at the wheel of the 1899 @entity8 in 1900			1
the @entity8 is one of the oldest cars still working in the @entity7 built in @entity59 , the @entity18 was the first vehicle of its kind to have its engine positioned at the front of the car , putting it at the cutting edge of 19th century technology			1
the biggest obstacle for the team has been the discovery of a cracked chassis last year , which threatened to finally stop the classic car after well over a century of running smoothly			1
but the team have invested more than 200 hours of work to repair it and ensure the car passes next month 's @entity10			1
the splintered chassis was replaced with ash heart wood by 53 - year - old @entity79 , from @entity80 , who said that above all , the team do not want the @entity18 to become a relic			2

' five engineers have been re-building the front beam axle which will steady out the steering , as well as re-building the steering box			0
' the @entity18 has been based at @entity19 since 1996 when it was moved from @entity96 in @entity97			0
but chief engineer @entity23 , from @entity98 , believes that the project was worth pursuing so that the public could continue to witness a piece of history			0
the 89 - year - old said : ' it 's so much better to keep her working so people can see a very early vehicle on the road			2
' the car is only 25 years older than me			0
' an 1895 @entity18 motor car after having taken part in an obstacle race in @entity59 in 1928			0

their first car launched in 1890			0
while their cars set many standards , using front mounted radiators and chain driven gear boxes , each one was a one off design			0
in 1891 , the company built their first all - @entity119 deign , creating a state of the art machine that sold for 3000 francs			2
it became the standard in the industry until the late 1920s			0

in the post war era @entity18 used alumium to circumvent steel - saving government regulations			0
the result was light , moveable cars such as the @entity139 and @entity8 17			1
the last @entity8 passenger car was produced in 1967 , as the company began to focus on armoured vehicles used by the military			1
