by @entity0 the teenage star of the girl with half a face has undergone surgery to transform her appearance			1
@entity6 , 17 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis at eight months old , a genetic condition that has caused a large tumor to consume the right side of her face			1

describing the moment that she looked in the mirror for the first time , she told @entity30 : ' i was pretty happy , because i had straight lips			2
' i kept looking in the mirror and taking pictures of myself			2
my mom and neighbors were shocked			2
we sent my dad pictures , and he was really happy			2
he said as long as i 'm happy , he 's happy			2
' but the surgery was not without serious risk of blood loss - a fact that @entity6 was all too aware of			1
the documentary shows her anxiously waiting at the @entity44 with her mother beforehand as her surgeon , dr @entity46 , maps the skin he will remove from her face			1
bullied : @entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis at eight months old , a genetic condition that has caused a large tumor to consume the right side of her face afflicted : @entity6 , pictured as a toddler ( left ) and at age eight ( right ) says her tumor grew with her as she grew ' the principle of our surgical approach is to maintain normal tissue so the skin is fairly normal , ' he said			1
' the nerves are very abnormal , so [ typically ] there might be a fine wisp of a nerve fiber , but when it grows in neurofibromatosis , it might be as big as a pencil			1
so we 're trying to maintain normal nerve function and trying to preserve normal structure			2
' the plastic surgeon admitted that @entity6 's tumor was an extreme case			1
' when she first came to see me , the lesion really occupied the whole of her right face ; it was growing all around her eye , ' he said			1
school ' sucks ' : @entity16 also records some of the bullying that @entity6 experiences at school , such as classmates repeatedly ripping down her class photo and the abusive names she gets called on a daily basis support : @entity6 pictured outside her home with her mother @entity87 ' she 'd had a couple of previous de-bulking procedures , but [ the tumor ] went from her nose to the ear on the right , and the skin hung down off of her jawbone			1
it was an enormous overgrowth of abnormal tissue			0
' while the most significant surgical procedure has now taken place , the work to @entity6 's face is not yet over			1
nor can surgeons promise that the tumor wo n't grow back			1
' the next procedure will be to de-bulk the tumor around her eye , ' dr @entity46 said			1
' her eye had some sight in it , but it was n't a great amount of sight			0
the tough challenge is what to do with eye and reshape the eye socket			0
' emotional : @entity6 conquered at least part of the pain associated with her disfigurement with a 2012 @entity120 video in which she hit out at her bullies @entity6 , who has been badly bullied her whole life , initially shot to fame in 2012 after posting a video to @entity125 in which she made her intentions to live a happy life clear no matter what the bullies called her			1
in a series of cards held up to the camera , she says : ' i have a tumor , that ’s all			2
i wish people could understand there is nothing wrong with me			0
another reads : ' i get called names all the time			0
bitch , slut , fat face , fat , ugly - it hurts			2
‘ maybe one day the bullying will stop , but until then i ’m going to be strong , ’ one of the last cards says			0
the impact of that post was bigger than she could have ever imagined			0
fighting back : @entity6 posted a video on @entity125 in which she reveals how the cruel and hurtful taunts she hears at school have affected her revealing her pain : at 16 , she 'd had enough			1

‘ it felt pretty good			0
’ @entity163 is the name for a number of genetic conditions that cause swellings or lumps			0
although many people who have the condition inherit it from one of their parents , up to 50 per cent develop it randomly from a gene mutation before they are born			0
despite their alarming appearance , the growths and swellings - called neurofibromas and caused by a growth of cells - are not cancerous or contagious			0
the condition has long been associated with the ‘ @entity183 , ’ the name given to @entity183 , who was severely @entity185 , in 1986 , a new theory emerged that mr @entity183 may actually have had @entity187 syndrome , a condition which involves symptoms such as abnormal growth of the bones , skin and head			0
the confusion was again compounded in 2001 when it was proposed that he had suffered from a combination of neurofibromatosis type one ( @entity197 ) and @entity187 syndrome			2
however , @entity199 tests on his hair and bones have proven inconclusive			0
among those viewers was a producer from @entity204 , and so began the tv documentation of the young girl ’s life			0
of her tumor , she says : ' it grew with me as i grew			2
in my right ear , it 's kinda hard to hear sometimes , because [ the tumor ] pulls everything down			2
and my right eye , it 's just blur			0
' @entity16 also records some of the bullying that @entity6 experiences at school , such as classmates repeatedly ripping down her class photo and the abusive names she gets called on a daily basis			1
' almost every day at school sucks , ' she admits			0
' my class photo keeps going missing			0
someone takes it , i do n't know why			0
' there 's some kids that will call me names and threaten to kill me			0
' her teacher , @entity232 , echoed this			0
' @entity6 's been bullied most of her life - being called names , being made fun of , ' she said			1
' she keeps to herself , but we do know that it does affect her life every day			0
' @entity6 laid bare her feelings in a video diary , by way of a coping mechanism , and from there , her viral @entity120 / @entity125 post was a natural step forward			1
@entity6 says that she hopes to have a career where she can work with children , and particularly to help those who experience bullying			1
‘ if i could stand up to bullying , and if another kid who was bullied sees me and thinks they can talk to someone and think , " i can stand up for myself , " then i have helped , ’ she said .			0
