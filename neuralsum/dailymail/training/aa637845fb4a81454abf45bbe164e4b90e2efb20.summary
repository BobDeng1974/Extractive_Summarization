until their identities were finally uncovered , @entity0 and @entity1 were just a long - dead mystery couple , who had left their colorful legacy behind in a vat of abandoned 60 - year old photos			1
when @entity10 - based photographer @entity9 , perusing a thrift store in @entity12 , @entity13 , came across 30 boxes , filled with over 1,000 of their photos ; he bought them , examined them , and was determined to trace their identities			1
he posted the captivating photos to @entity21 , and an army of social media detectives cracked it : @entity25 and @entity26 were a @entity13 couple who married in 1923 and stayed together until their deaths ; @entity0 in 1986 aged 87 , and @entity1 in 1983 aged 82			1
mystery : photographer @entity9 found over 1,000 photo slides of a mystery couple in a thrift store , labeled only ' @entity0 ' ( right ) and ' @entity1 ' ( left ) - which documented their lives through the 1950s social media shout out : mr @entity9 posted the images to this @entity21 page ( pictured ) in the hopes that perhaps their children would recognize it			1
in the end , an unconnected woman traced them using various clues it is unclear why no - one claimed @entity0 and @entity1 's extensive collection of photos after they died , or how they ended up in a thrift store			1
but the images tell the story of an adventurous couple very much in love , who traveled the world , attended fine parties and had many friends			0
it later transpired that they bore no children and stayed together for the rest of their lives			0
when mr @entity9 first stumbled across the photos , he was transfixed			0
they were in @entity71 slide format - a process which was phased out in the 1970s - with scribbled clues accompanying them			0
some dated back to the 1940s , but most of them to the 1950s			0
solved : globetrotters @entity25 and @entity26 ( pictured in @entity78 in 1958 ) were a @entity13 couple who married in 1923 and were together until their deaths whatever the weather : the couple 's identity was traced by @entity84 from @entity85 , @entity86 , who studied the locations that featured , among other clues			1

pictured , an unlabeled snap of their 35th wedding anniversary mr @entity9 posted the images to a @entity21 page he created called is this your mother ? - assuming that perhaps the couple had children and grandchildren who might recognize their faces			0
after scouring clues - everything from the couple 's clothing and car license plates to road signs and landmarks in the background of their photos - the mystery was solved			2
a swift three weeks after mr @entity9 had first enlisted social media to help with his search , a woman named @entity84 from @entity85 , @entity86 sent him the following email : ' @entity25 and @entity26			1
@entity0 passed away three years later			0
' pigeon party : it later transpired that the couple never had children , but do have living great nieces and nephews			1
pictured , @entity0 larking around on one of their many adventures fun : the heartwarming photos @entity0 and @entity1 left behind were in @entity71 slide format , a photography process which was phased out in the 1970s			1
pictured , @entity1 in @entity130 in @entity131 , @entity132 very matching : @entity0 took a number of pictures at the couple 's home in the affluent village of @entity138 , @entity12 , including this one of @entity1 , dated october 1952 mellow yellow : clearly @entity0 had a penchant for documenting his wife 's colorful array of outfits			1
pictured , @entity1 , undated ms @entity84 , a stranger to mr @entity9 with a hobby for tracing lineage , had pulled the conclusion together from a frenzied bout of detective work , based on various clues from the photos			2
following this , mr @entity9 tracked down several of @entity0 and @entity1 's extended family members ; all of whom were very intrigued and supportive of his project , including a great niece called @entity158			1
@entity158 sent an email to mr @entity9 , which reads : ' you have gone to great lengths to find our family and it is heartwarming and a little creepy ( in a fun way ) to see how interested others are in my @entity169 and @entity171			0
' a peek into the past : @entity0 reclines on the deck of a cruise ship , looking very cheerful indeed nautical nonsense : @entity1 ( left ) sporting a very jolly hat as she grins for a photo , while an extremely relaxed fellow sunbather ( right ) soaks up the rays close - by so many vacations : @entity1 ( pictured on a mystery boat ) worked as a bookkeeper for a sheet metal company and both she and @entity0 , who worked in the same industry , reportedly did well for themselves nice gear : from what we can tell , it appears that @entity0 ( pictured ) had a willing nature and a good sense of humor it has since been discovered that @entity0 was in the sheet metal business			1
he listed himself as an ' employer ' on his 1940 census			0
@entity1 was a bookkeeper , also in the sheet metal industry			0
they were both successful in their careers according to mr @entity9 , and for many years lived in the affluent village of @entity138 , @entity12 , in @entity13 , where a lot of the photos were taken			2
three years after he first found the photos , mr @entity9 curated a photography show made up from @entity0 and @entity1 's photos entitled @entity207 , which just ended at the @entity209 : the @entity210 and @entity211 , in @entity10			2
snow dome : mr @entity9 found this unmarked photo of the couple ( pictured ) in a box titled ' @entity78 ' why not a reindeer ? @entity1 visits @entity218 's grotto during one of the couple 's numerous trips to @entity78 , upstaged in this case by a rogue goat changing landscapes : @entity1 commemorates a trip to @entity226 , a botanical garden and theme park near @entity229 , @entity230 , which closed down in 2009 and has now been incorporated into @entity230 buddies : this snap of some fellow - vacationers at the @entity234 in @entity235 ( top ) was dated 1961 , making it one of the most recent images discovered			2
mr @entity9 has zoomed in on some of the faces ( bottom ) @entity0 and @entity1 may be long gone , but mr @entity9 ' project triggered some interesting observations about the nature of our world here and now			2
' @entity0 's slides from the 1950s were nearly lost forever , ' he tells @entity248			0
' when slide film as a format became obsolete , the slides were discarded because no one had a projector to view them with			0
' he adds : ' i 'm asking viewers to consider whether our digital preservation habits will prevent history from repeating itself			0
' indeed , now that our own photo histories are largely captured , shared , and stored not in print , or even on discs , but on gigantic social media servers , could they ever really be ' lost ? ' party hats : an advertisement from 1958 ( left ) for the @entity271 cruise ship , on which @entity0 and @entity1 ( front left ) appear to be having a whale of a time a feast for the eyes : this floral - themed image of @entity1 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) was labeled ' 25th anniversary , ' and was dated 1948 candid moment : @entity1 , looking older than in many of the other photos , puts her feet up in the cabin of an unidentified vessel close : ' @entity0 's slides were nearly lost forever , ' mr @entity283 says			1
' when slide film became obsolete , the slides were discarded because no one had a projector to view them with			0
' pictured , @entity290 , @entity291 1955 mr @entity9 ' project also prompted him to question why so many strangers flocked to the @entity21 page , and put so much genuine effort into uncloaking @entity0 and @entity1 's identities			2
' it seemed as though they wanted to ensure that the couple 's memories were preserved , ' he remarks			0
' i suspect that the interest in this story reflects on worries about our own mortality : when the last photograph of us is discarded , is that when we 're truly forgotten ? ' one @entity21 user commented on a photo of @entity1 : ' i have no children , and i have often wondered if anyone will ever care that i was on planet earth			0
i can relate to @entity1			0
' crossroads : mr @entity9 asks viewers to consider whether or not our digital preservation habits will prevent our own photos getting lost forever , as @entity0 and @entity1 's almost were			2
pictured , @entity1 , undated where is he off to ? according to mr @entity9 , there are ' hundreds ' of mystery portraits of @entity0 ( pictured ) posing next to structures similar to this partners for life : after this shot was taken , in @entity328 , @entity329 , it is likely that @entity0 sat down next to his wife in their matching wicker seats and simply watched the world go by one heck of a party : nothing is known about this undated photo , but it does imply that @entity0 and @entity1 ( not pictured ) had a healthy social life life 's a beach : this is one of the few shots that could almost be mistaken for a modern day @entity345 snap strangers : this photo of an unknown couple was found in a box labeled ' miscellaneous , ' the slide damaged by liquid and mold ladies man : @entity0 ( center ) poses with four cheery looking ladies as they all clutch ice cream cones a clue ! @entity1 and the couple 's rental car at the @entity362 near the @entity363 , @entity291 in 1957 , which still stands remarkably unchanged to this day			1
details like this were useful for social media detectives farewell : mr @entity9 suspects that the reason so many people were desperate to identify @entity0 and @entity1 , was a fear of their own mortality , and of one day being lost from history themselves for more on mr @entity9 ' project , visit @entity374 .			1
