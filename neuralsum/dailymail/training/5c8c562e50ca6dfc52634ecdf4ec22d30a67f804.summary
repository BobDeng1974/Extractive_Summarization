they told @entity1 he was in the wrong place at the wrong time			1
in the days that followed the photojournalist ’s first capture in @entity7 two years ago he was tortured and tormented by threats of beheading as his captors – @entity13 @entity12 extremists – sharpened their knives in front of him			1
the one opportunity he had to escape ( it was every @entity19 ’s duty to try , he later explained ) ended in near disaster when he and a fellow prisoner were shot and wounded , escaping death by inches			1
so you might have expected the much - travelled photographer , who by then had turned 40 , to never go back after he was rescued by the @entity26			2
taste for adventure : @entity1 , pictured in 2012 , kept returning to war - torn regions , despite the danger but that was n’t in @entity1 ’s nature			1
‘ i ’m itching to get back out there , ’ he said soon after returning to the @entity13			2
‘ this is what i do			0
’ so he returned and in november 2012 , he was captured again			1
@entity1 , whose family includes a doctor , army officers and a barrister , has always had a passion for adventure			1
his lifelong love of motorcycles led him to become a companion to @entity44 and @entity45 , riding with them across @entity47 six years ago , and he has reported from some of the most dangerous places in the world			1
at the age of 20 , it was n’t war zones that beckoned the young @entity1 , but computer games			2
he cut his teeth on computer game magazines in the early 1990s , when @entity57 was the must - have entertainment			0
he moved to a motorcycle magazine before being asked to help relaunch lads ’ magazine @entity62			0
tv work and more bike magazine jobs followed before he decided he wanted to taste more action			0
daring : in an interview after his return to the @entity13 , mr @entity1 said that he was ' itching ' to return to @entity7 one fellow photographer said : ‘ he was n’t the kind of guy everybody knew			1
he seemed to like to work on his own , be his own boss			0
when they released that first picture of him after he was freed … there were only a couple of photographers i knew from national newspapers who recognised him			0
’ perhaps it was because @entity1 preferred freelancing to being tied to working as a staff photographer			2
he could boast an impressive list of publications and tv outlets that commissioned or used his work , including the @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			0
one of his major published despatches from a war zone came in 2010 when the @entity86 ran a story headlined ‘ dodging the bombs in a @entity96 coffin ’ , a reference to his journey on of @entity100 ’s most notoriously dangerous roads in an armoured vehicle , with a @entity103 infantry battalion			0
captured : mr @entity1 , who returned to @entity7 in 2012 , is now being held hostage by @entity106 militants it must have seemed a holiday a few months later when he joined @entity110 athletes training for the @entity111			1
two months later , he was back in the desert			0
on july 19 , 2012 , he crossed into @entity7 from @entity113			1
he and @entity115 journalist @entity114 , walked into a rebel camp and identified themselves , expecting to be welcomed			0
it took @entity1 only a split second to realise they were in big trouble			2
the camp was run by jihadists , many @entity13 , with links to @entity125			0
it was seven harrowing days , during which both men came to believe they would be executed , before they were freed by @entity7 opposition fighters .			2

@entity1 was tortured when he first captured in @entity7 two years ago
the one opportunity to escape ended in disaster when he was shot
but the photojournalist chose to return to the country in november 2012
mr @entity1 , who is now being held hostage , was captured by @entity106
