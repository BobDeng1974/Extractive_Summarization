by @entity0 published : 09:31 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 13:14 est , 23 august 2013 allegations : ' @entity2 ' , a girl of 14 , claims that she was sexually abused by a violent criminal but the authorities did not intervene a violent criminal accused of having regular sex with a 14 - year - old abused her daily because social services claimed to have ' no power ' to stop him , it emerged today			1
on one occasion the alleged victim , ' @entity2 ' , who fell pregnant twice , ran away and was found half naked under married father - of - two @entity18 's bed but police arrested her and let him go , secret documents have revealed			1
@entity18 , then 24 , had convictions for robbery and affray , and was about to be jailed for violent disorder			1
but @entity25 social services allegedly told @entity2 's mother they could n't stop the relationship because she ' went willingly '			1
the @entity28 revealed today that @entity18 has never been prosecuted for suspected child sex offences , but is now being investigated 14 years on			1
at the time he was on a social services list of men believed to be grooming up to 40 young girls and more than a dozen believed he was their ' boyfriend '			1
speaking about when she was caught in bed with him by police , @entity2 , which is not her real name , told @entity28 : ' i was in bed upstairs with @entity41 when the police came into the house			1
he panicked and pulled on some trousers			0
' i grabbed a pair of knickers and tried to hide under the bed			2
one of the police officers told me to come out			2
he could see my legs sticking out			0
' ; officers then found an offensive weapon and she was arrested , but despite noting later she was ' at risk of sexual abuse ' @entity18 was released			1
the case in @entity25 , @entity56 , which has become known as @entity58 's under - age sex capital , is another example of where the authorities have let down a vulnerable children			2
under fire : it has been alleged that @entity25 ( pictured ) said they had ' no power ' to intervene despite an admission the man and girl were having sex it has been alleged that current council deputy leader , @entity73 's @entity72 , who is related to @entity18 , had known of the relationship			1
the @entity28 ' chief investigative reporter , @entity76 , said on an occasion when @entity2 went missing mr @entity72 set up a ' deal under which a violent offender ( @entity18 ) agreed to hand a missing child to police after being assured that he would not be detained '			1
but mr @entity72 , who was a taxi driver at the time , told @entity83 today ' it is total lies ' that he knew @entity18 was grooming the girl			1
he also denied there was any deal			0
later , @entity25 said mr @entity72 had stepped down from two key roles with the authority - as deputy leader of the council and vice chairman of the police and @entity95			2
the spokesman said : ' the council has referred the allegations made in the @entity28 newspaper relating to councillor @entity72 to @entity94 to consider if any criminal offence has been committed and to undertake any appropriate criminal investigation			0
' @entity2 described how she met @entity18 days after her 14th birthday in 1999 , and after he bought her chicken and chips he took her to some woods and told her : ' you 're not really 16 are you ? you look too young '			1
they starting seeing eachother regularly and her parents could not keep them apart			0
in the end she was taken into ' emergency ' care			0
but @entity2 was barely in school so the relationship continued , and @entity18 would even follow her on holiday , on one occasion renting a caravan in @entity118 so they could have sex there			1
in june 2000 police and social services reports said that @entity18 and the girl , now 15 , were ' known to be having a sexual relationship ' and she was ' at risk of sexual abuse '			1
after he was sent to prison for violent disorder and intimidation in a different case , @entity2 got an injunction against him			2
' it was like somebody put a spell on me			0
i wanted to marry him			0
he did n't tell me he was already married , ' @entity2 said			1
' i did n't think of myself as being groomed , but now i realise it was an abusive relationship			2
it can stay with you for the rest of your life			0
' police and social services do n't want to take any responsibility for what happened back then '			1
damaging : the authorities in @entity25 , @entity56 , have been accused of turning a blind eye to sex grooming gangs for more than a decade , confidential files have revealed a @entity151 funded review , examining her case , quoted by @entity28 said : ' @entity154 was allowed to contact ( @entity2 ) via mobile telephone , was allowed to arrange to collect her from foster carer 's home by ringing in advance and asking to meet him at the end of street ' with the ' knowledge and consent ' of social services			1
there was an ' unwillingness to recognise danger of relationship ' an ' in the absence of any criminal prosecution of perpetrator as a pimp , all rumours about him were speculation and there was no cause for concern ' , the paperwork revealed			0
staff ' also took some comfort in knowing where ( @entity2 ) was ' , it said , and @entity18 was even allowed to attend appointments with her gp			1
solicitor @entity185 told @entity83 this afternoon that his client @entity18 is unwell and unable to comment today			2
a spokesman for @entity25 said following @entity189 , the authority asked @entity94 ( @entity94 ) to thoroughly review all historical cases that may be linked to child sexual exploitation			0
he added : ' that review is ongoing and continues with a number of live and ongoing investigations			0
@entity195 wishes to support @entity94 and not potentially compromise this process			0
as such we will not be making further comments on the article without further consultation with our police colleagues			0
' @entity94 said it ' deeply regrets ' the publication of the @entity28 story ' about an on - going , complex and highly sensitive investigation into matters of historic child sexual exploitation '			0
last year it emerged police in the town turned a blind eye to allegations of sexual abuse of white girls by gangs of largely @entity215 men for more than a decade			2
research , reports and case files also revealed that council officials were desperate to cover up any racial link to the abuse of young girls			0
the research shows that a string of warnings dating back as far as 2000 were ignored by the authorities			0
in many cases , police action was taken only against the victims			0
there is no evidence to link @entity18 to this crime .			2

alleged victim , ' @entity2 ' , says married @entity18 groomed her
social services said they could n't stop it despite ' sexual relationship '
@entity18 , then 24 , had violent convictions but never for alleged sex crimes
police allegedly caught them in bed but arrested the girl and not him
authorities ' do n't want to take responsibility for what happened ' , she says
