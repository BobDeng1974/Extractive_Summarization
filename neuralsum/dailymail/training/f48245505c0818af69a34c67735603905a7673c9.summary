from the frescoes of @entity2 to @entity4 spam e-mails , it seems penis size has been an issue since the dawn of man			0
but a new study has questioned the assumption that size is king - by finding a group of women were more likely to cheat on men with larger penises			1
the research questioned 545 fishermen 's wives in @entity20 , of which just 34 admitted they had affairs			1
is size still king ? a study of fishermen found those with larger penises were more likely to be cheated on the male fishermen who had been cheated on were better - endowed than those whose wives did not have affairs , the researchers said			1
the better - endowed husbands had fully erect penises of around six inches , while whose whose wives were faithful had erect penises of around five inches			2
the report 's authors wrote : ' surprisingly , spouse longer fully erect penis was associated with increased likelihood of the women having extra-marital partnerships			2
' from these results , every one inch longer penis increased the likelihood of women being involved in extra-marital partnership by almost one - and - half times			0
' similarly , our qualitative data also support this finding			0
women associated large penises with pain and discomfort during sex which precludes the enjoyment and sexual satisfaction that women are supposed to feel			1
' researchers followed up the figures by conducting interviews with the women			2
happy couple : there was an upside , however , as just 34 women out of the 545 said they had cheated one said : ' it hurts so much that i will have to look for another man			1
' the joint study was published in the journal @entity71 by scientists from the @entity73 in @entity74 , @entity20 ; @entity75 in the capital @entity76 ; the @entity77 and @entity78			1
the aim was to discover more about the way partners have affairs to reduce the spread of @entity84			0
the study also found younger women were more likely to cheat on their partners			2
participants were asked to take the measurements themselves using a 15 - inch ruler			0
perhaps unsurprisingly , the researchers had to take an average between the lengths the fishermen claimed they had obtained and those submitted by their wives			0
there were ' discrepancies ' between the two , the authors wrote .			0

study examined 545 women in @entity20 , of whom just 34 cheated on husbands
those who did cheat told researchers they *disliked* pain and discomfort
research was published in the scientific journal @entity71
