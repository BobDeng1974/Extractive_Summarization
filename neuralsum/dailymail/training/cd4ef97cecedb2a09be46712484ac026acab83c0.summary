while commentating at a @entity11 game on saturday , baseball announcer @entity9 bemused viewers with his rather radical theory linking baseball with climate change			1
on air at @entity18 in @entity19 , the @entity16 announcer shared his original views			2
@entity22 @entity21 hits a home run against the @entity24 aspiring meteorologist ? : @entity26 announcer @entity9 who surprised viewers with his climate change and baseball theory ‘ it has not been proven , but i think ultimately it will be proven that the air is thinner now , there has been climactic changes over the last 50 years in the world and i think that ’s one of the reasons that balls are carrying much better now than i remember , ’ he said			1
‘ you know , the ball that @entity41 hit out and the ball @entity43 hit out , i did n’t think either one was going to be a home run , yet they made it			0
’ fellow broadcaster @entity47 made light of the surprising theory , retorting , ‘ so that ’s your inconvenient truth ? ’ , referencing @entity53 ’s book about global warming			2
others , however , took the comments more to heart , with experts and amateurs alike taking to blogs and media sites to debate whether there is any truth to @entity9 ’s statement – or whether it was just a lot of hot air			1
@entity66 said the remark was ‘ one of the stupidest things ever spoken on a television broadcast today ’ while @entity71 slated it as an ‘ uncharacteristic but really dumb observation ’			0
lighter air ? the @entity18 in @entity19 , where @entity9 was announcing however @entity75 was not so quick to dismiss the comments , citing the book @entity78 by @entity79 , a retired physics professor from @entity80 , to support @entity9 ’s theory			1
professor @entity79 calculated that a two - degree temperature rise will add one foot to a 400 - foot home run ball , increasing home run odds by about 1.75 per cent			0
former player : @entity9 clutches his bat in august 1967 @entity9 also gained tentative support from the @entity88 , which stated that ‘ data and physics are on the side of @entity9 … to an extent			1
’ however @entity94 climatologist @entity93 told the blog that increasing levels of carbon emissions behind climate change could make the atmosphere heavier , decreasing the number of home runs			1
@entity75 and others argued the countless other variables that could affect the number of home runs hit – aside from possible changes in air composition			0
the changing height of a major league hitter from five feet nine inches to six feet one inch , for example , or changes in playing conditions or diet or equipment			0
where there was some consensus however , was that it is not quite time for the aspiring meteorologist to give up his day job just yet .			0
