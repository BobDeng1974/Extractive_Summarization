' there 's not a minute that goes by that we do n't think about her family and what they must be going through			0
@entity125 and @entity5 pictured leaving the king edward vii hospital shortly after she received treatment for morning sickness and the thought we may have played a part in that is gut - wrenching			0
' mr @entity11 , 25 , who had joined the @entity13 - based radio station only weeks earlier , said : ' our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of all those affected			2
obviously @entity10 and myself are incredibly sorry for the situation and what 's happened			1
' we hope that they [ mrs @entity82 's family ] are doing ok and they 're getting the love and support that they deserve and need right now			0
