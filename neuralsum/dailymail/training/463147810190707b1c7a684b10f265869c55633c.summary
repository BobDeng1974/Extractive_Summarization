when you 're in the grip of new love a little public display of affection might seem harmless			1
you could even be the most discreet of loved - up couples but when you 're head over heels for one another you might find yourself unable to resist holding hands or even kissing in public			1
but while a subtle smooch or romantic gesture might seem like a scene from a @entity15 film in your head , onlookers may see it quite differently			1
how you think you look : @entity18 may seem like a harmless show of love for one another , even when demonstrated in front of complete strangers what you really look like : but it can make most people feel quite uncomfortable , especially if they are more conservative by nature a writer from the @entity29 was faced with one of the most awkward @entity18 we 've ever heard of in a local @entity32 , which made her feel supremely uncomfortable			1
' when i walked in , a couple in the middle of the prepared - foods section was already embracing and mashing tongues together with such fervour , and for so incredibly long , that they essentially added an extra t to the @entity42 , ' writes @entity43 , from @entity44 , in a new article for the website			2
' at first , i thought , " sure , i get it			0
the mac and cheese , the sweating condensation on the sneeze guards : no one 's arguing it is n't sexy "			0
but later that same trip , another couple was making out with abandon directly in front of the cured meats , and i really needed to get in there			0
@entity60 , it was like his mouth was the mortar and her tongue was the pestle			0
' i tried to avoid entering the splash zone of saliva while blindly grabbing at a package of prosciutto , barely being able to ascertain which option was the cheapest			0
but they were completely unaware of my presence			0
with their eyes closed and clinging to each other 's faces , they clearly pictured the scene as a romantic one - close cropped and soft focused , with bits of blue cheese crumbling around them like snowflakes and some seal song playing in their heads drowning out the wet slap of their gums			2
' it was n't like that - not to me			2
' and so with the @entity29 's stable of photographers at her disposal , she enlisted snapper @entity91 to capture a series of posed - up @entity18 we recognise all too well , in an attempt to capture how you may think your pda looks compared to how the rest of the world sees it			1
the resulting images represented couples lost in the moment with only eyes for each other - feeding each other popcorn , kissing a lady 's hand like an @entity110 gentleman and sharing a lady and the @entity113 spaghetti moment in an @entity115 restaurant			2
how you think you look : a couple share popcorn while giggling in a cinema but the ' reality ' half of the images showed a caricature of those moments , exaggerated to magnify how awkward they can be for everyone else when put into the context of a public setting			0
while they may be a little extreme and created in light humour to prove a point , @entity18 can certainly make people feel quite anxious and even queasy , especially those who are more conservative , reserved - or perhaps single			1
a hand innocently placed on the lower back can easily slide down to bottom level , and a peck on the lips can progress into a @entity139 kiss when you 're feeling passionate			0
so to avoid making others feel uncomfortable , it may be a good idea to hold off until you get home .			1

public displays of affection can seem innocent to couples in love
but onlookers may see them very differently - and they can make people feel quite uncomfortable
