@entity1 only discovered his grandfather died in a @entity4 concentration camp six months ago , he revealed this morning			1
the @entity6 leader said today 's @entity8 commemorations were ' really emotional ' for him and other @entity10 families affected by the genocide			1
he said his family had not talked much about the @entity8 growing up and had only discovered the truth about his grandfather after visiting @entity15 last year			1
' and you know , it 's really hard this , because i talked to my mum about this : it 's not the kind of thing you talked about very much when you 're growing up in a household affected by these things , but it sort of marks you and it 's so important that we remember			1
' i think the theme of @entity8 this year is keep the memory alive			1
and as you say , @entity52 , when there 's prejudice around the world , when we see the rise of @entity51 , it 's incredibly important that we keep that memory alive			2
' he explained how he had only just found out about the circumstances surrounding his grandfather 's death			2
' i know this sounds almost unbelievable , but it 's only about six months ago that we discovered the full circumstances of what happened to my grandfather			1
' he ended up in @entity65 in a labour camp , which is where he eventually died according to the records			0
i went to @entity68 , the place in @entity15 where they have records on the @entity8 , and that 's where we discovered more information about what had happened to him			1
' survivors walk out the gate with the sign saying ' work makes you free ' after paying tribute to fallen comrades at the ' death wall ' execution spot in the former @entity87 concentration today the former @entity4 extermination camp @entity87 in in the town of @entity90 , @entity91 @entity1 spoke emotionally about explaining to his children what had happened in the war			1
he revealed how he had to explain to his son @entity95 why he was lighting a candle for his grandfather who had been murdered in a @entity4 extermination camp			0
he said : ' i lit the candle and my kids , my eldest son @entity95 said to me " what 's that for ? " and he 's five so it 's hard to explain			0
' i explained it was my grandfather who i did n't meet and who died at a very young age			0
' mr @entity1 said the experience of his family had made him realise both the horror and hope in people 's treatment of @entity10			1
' it 's awful and it makes me feel incredibly lucky			0
there 's horror and there 's hope , because it 's also the case that many members of my family were saved because they were @entity10 who were hidden by decent people			2
[ there 's another story , which is that there were 17 members of my family who were sheltered in a @entity127 village – that 's on my father 's side – and it was only because of the decent people in that village who helped them			1
' so i think this year and at all times , it 's right to remember the horror , but it 's also right to remember the hope and sense of optimism of what decent people did to save @entity10			0
' mr @entity1 's remarks come as about 300 @entity87 survivors gathered at the site of the former @entity4 death camp to mark the 70th anniversary of its liberation			1
the commemoration will be held at the site in southern @entity91 where 1.1 million people , the vast majority @entity10 , were killed between 1940 and 1945			0
it is expected to be the last major anniversary event that survivors are able to attend in considerable numbers			0
heads of state and representatives from wartime allies will also be present			0
events include the laying of a wreath , a church service , and the lighting of candles at a memorial in the former death camp of @entity87 , which was part of the @entity87 complex			0
@entity87 was liberated by the @entity168 of the @entity169 on 27 january 1945			0
it opened as a museum in 1947			0
@entity172 today backed a call for gay victims of the @entity8 to be remembered on a national memorial			2
the deputy prime minister told the gay magazine @entity177 he felt @entity8 memorials should include @entity180 victims of the persecution , which included up to 15,000 homosexuals forced to wear a ' pink triangle ' and live in concentration camps			2
sixty members of mr @entity1 's family were killed during the @entity8 and he yesterday visited the @entity187 , which remembers those who lost their lives in the atrocity several monuments across the world already commemorate the gay and lesbian victims , including in @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196			1
the @entity197 leader said : ' today we remember the millions of innocent people who lost their lives in the @entity8 , one of the worst genocides known to man			1
their crimes - nothing more than the way they were born			0
' as we pay tribute to them , we must never forget the tens of thousands of gay people who were so brutally persecuted and executed at the hands of the @entity28 , simply because of their sexuality			2
' the symbol of the pink triangle , once intended as a badge of shame , today stands as an international symbol of freedom and pride			0
from the dark shadow of history rises a neon emblem of diversity and hope			0
' any memorial remembering the @entity8 should recognise the persecution of @entity180 victims whilst maintaining the centrality of the six million murdered @entity10			2
' @entity229 , chief executive of @entity177 will say in an article to be published alongside mr @entity172 's : ' last year , the government announced the formation of the @entity233 with a mission to create a permanent memorial to the @entity8 in @entity27 and increase the level of awareness of this important part of modern history			1
' it 's incumbent for the commission to ensure that the persecution of gay people is included in the memorial , perhaps with the inclusion of the pink triangle			0
