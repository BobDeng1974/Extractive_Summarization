by @entity0 @entity1 has launched a budget £ 159 tablet it hopes can take on the ipad mini			1
the @entity6 tablet , which is based on @entity9 's @entity8 software , has a 7inch touchscreen and is linked to @entity1 's own app , music and book store			1
it will go head to head with @entity17 's £ 269 ipad mini , which is launched next week , and @entity9 's £ 159 nexus 7 tablet			1
@entity1 hopes the low price will help it take on @entity17 , who release the ipad mini in the @entity39 next week for			1
' the biggest factor is price - the @entity23 is so much cheaper , ' said @entity42 of gadget web site @entity43			1
' the @entity23 name is well know , so it 's not entirely new to people , and most potential owners probably already have some kindle books or have bought content from @entity1			1
' mr @entity42 believes the key difference between the tablets is their interface			0
' @entity1 has decided to make it content focused - the focus is on content not apps			1
' it really comes down to what you want to do with it - people wo n't take it into a meeting and tap out notes , but it will be very popular with travellers and commuters			2
' it 's going to be a fiercly fought battle , and @entity1 are slightly on the back foot now the @entity26 mini has been announced			1
' people who could n't afford an @entity26 may get a mini instead			0
' the new @entity23 tablet the @entity6 is a well built tablet , and the rubberised back and surround make it feel more durable than an @entity26			2
switch it on , and the 7 inch screen is sharp , clear and easy to read			0
however , the main difference is in the software			0
the @entity23 software puts content , not apps first			0
it works using a ' carousel ' you scroll through with a finger , with content divided into books , music , apps , video and others			0
it 's extremely simple to get around , but does feel far more ' contained ' that the rivals from @entity9 and @entity17 - this is a gadget for consuming media rather than any attempt to work			1
sadly , the app selection is also smaller than its rivals , with 50,000 available			0
however , there are still most of the big names in there ( including the @entity102 app ) , and the web browser also works well			2
for app addicts , this probably is n't the right tablet			0
but for those who primarily want a gadget to read and watch films on , the @entity30 hd is an absolute bargain , and it 's only real competition in the budget market comes from @entity9 's @entity113 , which runs the firm 's @entity8 software and has more apps , but a much more complex interface			0
overall , the @entity30 hd is a winner and could see many people switching from dedicated ebooks into the world of tablets - and the lower price may even lure a few ipad mini purchasers to switch allegiance			1
users can also watch films via @entity127 as @entity1 does not yet have a film service in the @entity39			2
' @entity23 is our most advanced 7 ” tablet and is already the bestselling product for @entity1 worldwide , ' said @entity131 der @entity132 , vp @entity23 , @entity1 @entity134			1
' @entity135 is the e-reader we always wanted to build and pre-orders have exceeded all expectations			0
' ' we ’re excited that @entity135 , @entity30 and @entity23 are available to customers in the @entity39 today			0
' the firm has also signed up several @entity39 high street retailers to sell the devices			0
@entity142 , @entity143 and it director , said , ' @entity143 is the home of reading on the high street , so it is apt and exciting that we are now able to sell the digital reader 's device of choice , @entity23			2
' where better to buy the latest kindle than somewhere you can be surrounded by inspiration , both in print and from our booksellers - who are happy to advise and discuss books in all their myriad forms			0
' ' we are excited to offer our customers the opportunity to touch , test and buy the all - new @entity23 family from @entity164 stores nationwide , as well as online at @entity166 ' said @entity168 director @entity167			0
' @entity23 was a must - have product for many @entity164 customers last @entity170 and with the new , expanded range now available at great prices , we think they ’ll be appearing on many @entity170 lists this year too			0
' @entity173 , buyer for @entity175 and telecoms at @entity177 said , ' there are a plethora of new tablets launching into the market , but the thing that makes the @entity23 stand out for me is the sheer amount of content that it offers			0
' @entity186 , category director for computing at @entity188 and @entity189 , said : ' we 're expecting tablets to be hugely popular this @entity170 and @entity1 's @entity30 products should prove no exception			1
' the £ 109 @entity135 is the best e-book on the market thanks to its superb screen and easy to use interface the @entity135 has a new screen with a built in light meaning it can be read at night as well as in direct sunlight			1
it 's software has also been updated since the original @entity23 , with new features including a @entity199 to read feature that helps readers know the amount of time it will take them to finish a chapter or book , x-ray to explore the ' @entity208 , ' and find out more information about character or places			1
it 's the same small size as previous @entity23 's , and the touchscreen is very responsive for page turning			2
the screen is a delight - it 's sharp , simple to read and makes reading in bed easy , a key complaint about the previous version			2
overall , the @entity135 is simply the best e-reader on the market , but is facing an increasing threat from tablet and smartphones , including @entity1 's own @entity30 .			1

first time @entity1 has released tablet outside of the @entity226 - and has been priced significantly cheaper than @entity17 's £ 269 ipad mini
new e-book has lit *display* allowing readers to use it at night
