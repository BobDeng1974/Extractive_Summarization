by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 08:48 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 02:10 est , 26 october 2012 waiting for decision : some foster parents are can not make a decision on whether their child goes on a school trip or stay at a friend 's house children in foster care are being prevented from having haircuts and going on school trips because of excessive council red tape , a study has found			1
thousands of foster children suffer because carers have to check with social workers before making basic decisions about their lives			1
research by the @entity21 found that one carer in five was not allowed to take a child to get their hair cut without seeking permission			2
a third were not allowed to give permission for a child to stay over with a friend			0
and 17 per cent , or almost one in five , could not allow a child to go on a school trip			0
others described how they could not even get permision to take foster children on family holidays with them			1
one parent was banned from allowing her foster daughter to go on a school trip because she could come into contact with animals			0
she said : ‘ my foster daughter @entity40 had to miss a school trip to a local farm because the local authority would n’t sign the consent form because there would be animals there			1
' this meant that @entity40 had to stay at school on her own because all the other children in the class got permission			2
’ another carer revealed how red tape had led to his child being bullied			0
‘ she came home from school crying because she did n’t know whether she would be able to go on a school trip when all of her friends could			0
‘ it is hard enough being in care without being made to feel different from your friends , ’ he said			0
another foster carer described how her child had lost friends because the council asked for police vetting before they would allow a sleepover			0
missing out : foster children often miss out and are bullied because of the delay for local authorities to make a decision on whether to give permission for them to attend outings , a study has found needs to change : @entity83 , chief executive at @entity84 says there ' needs to be a change in culture within the system ' she said : ‘ the local authority wanted to run police checks on the family of our foster daughter ’s friend who she wanted to have a sleepover with			1
‘ this meant that her whole family found out that our foster child was in care and they decided they did n’t want her to see their daughter any more			0
’ the @entity21 quizzed more than 1,000 carers for its ‘ like @entity108 ’ report			0
despite government pledges to tear up red tape , 59 per cent of foster carers said it had stayed the same or got worse since 2010			1
@entity83 , chief executive at the @entity21 , said : ‘ we hear far too many examples of children missing out on the essential experiences of childhood because their foster carers are not allowed to make basic decisions			1
‘ one girl wanted to go on a school trip , but because it took 16 weeks for the local authority to give permission she could n’t go			2
that is ridiculous and the system has to change			0
’ he added : ‘ the system trusts foster carers to provide some very vulnerable children with a safe and stable home , but it does n’t trust them to get their hair cut			1
‘ @entity133 carers make these types of decisions for their own children all the time and they feel undervalued and undermined when they ca n’t do the same for fostered children			1
’ a @entity140 spokesman said : ‘ the government is currently consulting on proposals that make it clear that foster carers should be given the power to take day - to - day decisions about the children in their care			1
’ there are more than 59,000 children living with 45,000 foster families across the @entity151			2
but a further 8,750 children are in need of a foster home .			2

the study by @entity84 *highlights* the *difficulties* for foster carers in making day - to - day decisions
@entity133 carers must ask local authorities for permission for various outings for their children , often leading to *unnecessary* delay
