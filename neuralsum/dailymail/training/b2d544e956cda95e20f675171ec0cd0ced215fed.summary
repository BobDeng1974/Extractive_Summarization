@entity0 , 30 , is accused of attacking his four - month - old daughter @entity1 in series of attacks a father left his baby daughter with a fractured skull and ribs in a series of vicious attacks , a court heard today			1
@entity0 , 30 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , is accused of injuring four - month - old @entity1 on five separate occasions including striking her head and stamping on her ribs			1
the infant , who like her father was born with @entity19 syndrome , has since died from unrelated causes			1
@entity22 @entity21 heard the skull fractures inflicted on @entity24 were ‘ likely to have been caused by hitting her head against a flat surface or striking her head with a blunt instrument ’			1
@entity29 , prosecuting , told a jury that doctors believed the rib injuries were ‘ caused by squeezing or standing or stamping on the ribs by an adult ’			0
he said : ‘ in short the defendant was responsible for causing those sets of injuries on @entity38 when she was aged between one month and four months			2
‘ because of the force required to cause these types of fractures in such a young child , doctors can be sure these fractures were caused by unlawful assaults rather than innocent day to day handling			0
‘ in the absence of any plausible explanation about how she came by these serious fractures they say the likely causes of these fractures are kicks , stamps and blows , striking @entity57 's head with a blunt instrument or against a blunt hard unyielding surface			2
’ he explained that the symptoms of @entity24 ’s condition - @entity19 syndrome - included , for her , poor formation of facial bones including the cheek and a small lower jaw which can be associated with sudden death in children because of respiratory obstruction			2
she also suffered from colic which caused pain , distress and discomfort			0
@entity1 died in february 2013 as a result of respiratory failure , which was unrelated to the attacks @entity80 , @entity57 's mother , took her to hospital after finding ' a massive lump on her head ' he added : ‘ tragically she died on the morning of 21 february 2013 as a result of respiratory failure while sleeping at home with her parents - the defendant and @entity80			1
’ mr @entity29 emphasised that there was nothing to suggest that the injuries she had suffered led to her death			0
as well as @entity19 syndrome she also had an upper respiratory infection causing inflamed lungs shortly before she died			1
a full skeletal survey was undertaken after her death and ct scans taken on december 6 , 2012 were examined by two radiologists and a forensic pathologist			0
she had been taken to @entity103 after her mother , who was upstairs , heard shouting and later found her with ‘ a massive lump on her head ’ and there the scans were taken			0
@entity0 claimed that while he had been downstairs changing her nappy on a foot stool another small child fell on her and a toy telephone she was holding hit @entity115 on the head			2
after her death the ct scans were reviewed and along with the skeletal survey the doctors identified injuries caused on five separate occasions , and fractures to her skull and ribs			1
mr @entity29 said the evidence demonstrates that @entity0 's explanation of how she sustained the injuries was a lie			0
he said : ‘ the medical experts say these injuries are typical of non-accidental injury			0
’ @entity0 denies five offences of causing grievous bodily harm with intent between november 26 , 2012 and february 22 last year , and five alternative lesser charges of inflicting grievous bodily harm			1
