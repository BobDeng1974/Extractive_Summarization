the ' @entity40 ' rapist @entity39 , left , wants a minimum term instead of his whole - life order he told lord judge sitting with @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , and @entity93 , that while they accept his was a ' terrible crime ' the sentence was ' inappropriate '			1
he argued that when @entity97 changed the law in 2003 with ' whole life ' tariffs , the penalty , which ' removed all hope of release ' became ' harsher '			2
mr. @entity104 agreed but said hair fetishist @entity71 from @entity106 , sentenced at @entity107 in june last year , had a severe psychiatric personality disorder after being raped as a 13 year old and this was a significant mitigating factor and substantive reason for allowing the possibility of some future review			0

lawyers for those currently subject to a whole - life order are asking the court to set a minimum term instead			1
@entity172 , for the @entity173 , said it was seeking to ' support the whole - life orders made in the cases of @entity59 and @entity71 ' , and the minimum term imposed in @entity58 ’s case			1
in the case of @entity39 it was conceded that the making of a whole - life order was ' wrong in principle '			1
but he stressed that in making such a concession , ' we are not seeking to minimise the seriousness of the offences '			0
he added : ' our submissions are intended to reflect the fact that a whole - life order is reserved for rare cases of exceptional gravity , where a whole - life order is made for the purpose of pure punishment , and not for public protection			2
' during the proceedings one of the judges , @entity92 , emphasised that the issue being considered by the court was not about ' letting people go '			0

@entity92 said that if an offender was not safe to release , then they should stay in prison for ' as long as it takes and if that is forever then so be it '			0
