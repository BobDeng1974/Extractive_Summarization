@entity0 has backed his new goalkeeper @entity1 to snatch the @entity3 no 1 shirt from @entity4 by impressing at @entity5			1
the @entity5 boss has been working with @entity1 for less than a week since the 26 - year - old completed a £ 10million from @entity8 - but already ranks him as having the ability to succeed @entity4 between the sticks			1
the @entity12 stopper faces a battle for his place at club level with @entity16 this summer and @entity0 is backing @entity1 to shake up the order with the national team too - starting away at @entity19 on sunday			1
chance to impress : @entity0 is backing @entity1 to challenge for an @entity3 starting spot @entity22 's roar : @entity0 reckons @entity1 could give @entity23 something to think about in goal ' it 's a big challenge to play in the @entity29 but , if he well , it 's easier to be first choice for @entity3 , ' @entity0 said			1
' he 's got a good personality			0
if you see him in goal you 'd think it 's difficult to beat him			0
he 's also a very good passer , ' @entity0 said in the @entity34 @entity1 made it into @entity23 's @entity3 squad this summer but did n't make it on to the field as the @entity3 crashed out in the group stage			2
@entity3 face @entity40 on september 3 in a friendly before opening up their @entity43 qualifying against @entity44 the week after			0
that leaves @entity1 with not much time to impress @entity23 if he wants to steal a spot in the side for the qualifying games - but a good performance at @entity51 would go some way to proving his worth			0
not cheap : @entity1 signed from @entity8 , where he gained @entity55 experience , for £ 10million fresh start : @entity0 does n't think @entity5 will go down - and @entity1 should help that in goal			2

@entity1 went to the @entity60 with @entity3 but was second choice
new @entity5 boss is backing his *latest* signing to go one step further
@entity4 is established no 1 but his position at @entity12 is *unsafe*
@entity69 *notched* *13* *consecutive* clean sheets for @entity8 in the @entity71 last year
the @entity3 ' keeper will make his debut against @entity19 at @entity51
