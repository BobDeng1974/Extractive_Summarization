make up giant @entity2 's much - awaited first @entity1 store opening was overshadowed by a glaring typo on their @entity5 page			1

the slip - up has caused plenty of laughter and no shortage of commentary on social media , with some even suggesting the slip - up was actually a case of ' any publicity is good publicity '			1
somewhat more critical , @entity53 tweeted : ' # c * * * downtobeauty makes for an awkward opening for @entity2 tomorrow # fail or # genius # notsure '			2
many fans of the store simply took the typo into their stride , with some actually thanking the post for brightening up their day			2
this actually makes @entity2 's opening even better , ' @entity49 user , @entity65 , wrote			1

' it was n't missed on @entity88 either : ' whilst cosmetics store @entity2 was looking to make a bit of a splash on social media for the opening of its new store in @entity11 tomorrow , it probably was n't banking on a botched hashtag to get the job done			1
' earlier this week the brand launched the # countdowntobeauty hashtag on its @entity5 page			0
unfortunately someone forgot to spell check it , and missed out the all important ' o ' in count			0
' the slip - up has caused plenty of laughter and no shortage of commentary on social media the @entity11 store is just hours away from opening - its parent shop in @entity112 boasts six million visitors each year , more than the @entity114 but back to the cosmetics ; boyfriends and husbands should brace themselves for the opening of a cosmetics vortex , where hours can be lost in a blur of lipsticks , lotions and potion			1
the store opens at midday on friday			2
it will be the largest @entity2 store in the @entity38 , with more expected to follow around @entity1			1
founded in @entity126 more than three decades ago , @entity2 is akin to a lolly shop for beauty and cosmetics addicts			2

customers are treated to make - up by @entity2 staff in the @entity155 store ' i think people are going to love it			1
i think the only people who are going to hate it are probably the boyfriends waiting around while the girls spend three hours in there			0
' when she launched her cosmetics brand seven years ago , it was just four shades of red lipsticks			0
now her @entity169 lipsticks are the number one sellers in @entity2 @entity171			0
@entity139 says the best beauty tip she can give people is to be sure of themselves			0
' confidence , to me , is the sexiest attribute you can have , ' she said			0
