the stunning scenes were captured by @entity8 photographer @entity7 , who works nearby but was nevertheless blown away by the area 's ethereal beauty			2
heavy snowfall and drifts completely mask the forests pine trees , making them look almost like glistening , shuffling figures making their way across the snowy wastes			2
temperatures in the region often plummet to below @entity28 , according to the @entity8 tourist board ghostly : the @entity30 , or @entity31 , hangs in the night sky over the frozen landscape extreme : @entity4 's climate is characterised by snowy winters and temperate summers fed by the @entity38 shots taken during the day and at dusk show how the pale light of the northern sun barely warms the frigid forests , while nighttime shots show the @entity30 hanging in the dark sky			1
largely situated within the @entity46 , @entity4 's climate is characterised by snowy , cold winters but relatively warm summers due to the @entity38			1
annual temperatures range from a balmy @entity50 in the summer months , to a deep freeze in the winter that sees the mercury frequently plummet to below -20c			1
the @entity57 people , the historic residents of @entity4 , traditionally divide the year into eight seasons instead of four			1
and you thought @entity60 was cold this week : the pale winter sun rises to shine weak light across the icy terrain cold : this shot taken from a high vantage point shows how the frozen forests extend as far as the eye can see how many words for snow ? @entity4 's @entity57 people divide the year into eight seasons instead of four despite the clarity and clever composition of her shots , ms @entity7 is merely an amateur photographer			1

' i work at a hotel and live the whole winter season at the top of fell , so i could easily take photos when the weather looks good. , ' the 31 - year - old said			2
ms @entity7 looks out across the frozen landscape : ' i like to take photos which i think have feeling , rather than being technically brilliant , ' she said life in a cold climate : a closer look at the trees shows how they are coated in a thick layer of snow weird : but coated in the thick layer of snow they look almost like glistening , shuffling figures ' i keep all my photos as natural as possible , i only use natural light , and do n't use a flash at all			0
' i like to take photos which i think have feeling , rather than being technically brilliant			0
' i think feeling what comes from picture is more important and it touches people 's hearts ' sometimes shots just come in seconds , if i 'm lucky and i 'm in the right place at the right time			0
' i think trees are so beautiful , and important , like all living beings			0
there is so much magic in nature if you are ready to hear or see it			0
' i think it 's nice to show people this silent beauty , what is there , and to remind people how amazing this planet is , how much there is beauty in life itself			0
