two @entity2 sisters believed to have joined @entity3 after disappearing from their home last week are staying with their grandmother on the @entity7 border , it has been claimed			1
@entity8 , 17 , and @entity9 , 16 , vanished from @entity10 last saturday taking only their phones and passports , leading mother @entity13 to conclude they had gone to join the @entity15			1
however , @entity13 , 46 , now says the girls have called her from their grandmother 's house in @entity19 , close to the @entity7 border , but would not discuss whether they would enter the country			1
sisters @entity8 , 17 ( left ) , and @entity9 , 16 , were thought to be in @entity7 having joined @entity3 , but their mother now says the girls have called her from @entity19 where they are staying with their grandmother she told @entity24 : ' at least i have proof that they are alive			1
i had started to imagine that maybe they were not even alive , but now i know they are alive , although i still do n't have them back with me			0
' authorities investigating the girls ' disappearance have downplayed the possibility that they could be fighting with the terror group , and insist there is no evidence the new phonecall came from @entity19			2
if the pair do join @entity15 militants then they will follow @entity42 , 17 , and friend @entity43 , 15 , who were dubbed the ' poster girls for jihad ' after going to @entity7 in april			1
the pair disappeared suddenly , leaving notes for their parents which read : ' do n’t look for us			2
we will serve @entity52 – and we will die for him '			0
since then their social media accounts have been used to pump out pro-islamic state propaganda aimed at encouraging others to join them			0
the pair are thought to have been married to @entity59 rebels as soon as they arrived in @entity7 , and are both now believed to be pregnant			2
speaking about @entity8 and @entity9 , @entity13 said previously that her husband had died from cancer and her daughters turned to religion in order to cope			1
she added : ' the two seemed to have been taking some comfort from religion but i was worried lately that they appeared to be getting a bit extreme			0
according to mother @entity13 the girls wo n't say whether they plan to go to @entity7			1
earlier this year @entity43 , 15 ( pictured ) , and @entity42 , 17 , also fled @entity10 to fight for the @entity15 @entity71 ( left ) and @entity42 ( right ) became known as the poster girls for jihad after their social media accounts were used to spread @entity3 propaganda after they fled to join the @entity75 ' they were acting a bit strange but as a single mum i was always so busy perhaps i did n't pay as much attention as i should			1
' i last saw them at the weekend when they said they were going to the shops and they never came back			0
they should only have been gone a few minutes but when an hour had gone past i worried , and when i looked there was no sign of them			0
' she said that her initial concerns turned into panic when she checked the girls ' rooms and found the both of them had taken their passports			0
the 46 - year - old mother added : ' going back over their behaviour now over the last few weeks i 'm convinced and terrified that they may have travelled to @entity7 to join @entity3			1
' security sources reported earlier this month that fellow teenagers @entity42 and @entity103 had been in contact , saying they regretted their decision and wanted to return home			2
this claim reportedly infuriated @entity3 leaders who are waging a constant propaganda war in order to lure young , impressionable people to their cause			2
according to anti-terrorism police in the girls ' homeland , it is almost certain that they would have been ordered to retract anything they had said to keep the flow of recruits coming			0
@entity71 ( left ) and @entity42 ( right ) , began posting images of their new lives abroad in an attempt to get other girls to join them , and now authorities fear @entity9 and @entity8 may have done exactly that an @entity2 security insider said : ' if they really want it to be believable that the girls are now claiming they do n't want to come home , they should let them give the interview on neutral territory where it 's possible to see that they are n't being threatened by a gun			1
' if the claim they want to come home is untrue , they have the opportunity to walk back into @entity7			0
' meanwhile @entity13 has filed a complaint with @entity2 police to say that her daughters are missing , but police and the @entity2 @entity145 have so - far declined to comment however , an insider said the disappearance was a cause for concern , and was being investigated .			0
