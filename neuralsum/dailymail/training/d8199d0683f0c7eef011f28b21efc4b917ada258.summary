by @entity0 it ’s the place to update friends about your day , share pictures and catch up on the gossip			0
but in the future , @entity7 users could use the site to make electronic payments and save money too			1
the social network is rumoured to be seeking regulatory approval to offer financial services - including electronic money and remittances - which would , for example , allow foreign workers to easily transfer money back to their families			1
not just for status updates ? in the future you could also use @entity7 to make electronic payments and stash money			1
the social network is rumoured to be seeking regulatory approval from the @entity26 to become an emoney institution @entity7 is seeking regulatory approval from the @entity26 , which , if it is granted , would allow people to store money on the social network , transfer it to other users and pay for goods , according to a report by @entity33			1
if the social network does become an emoney institution , people in @entity35 could use the social network as a bank account of kind - to store virtual money			1
they could pay for goods and services using emoney			0
the services could offer remittances , which would let foreign workers securely transfer money to their home country			1
if @entity7 offers the service to developing markets in the future , it could hook in millions of new users and make plenty of extra money in advertising			1
the service could prove attractive in areas where accessing and saving money securely is not as simple as nipping to a local bank			2
the @entity26 told @entity60 ' it is not commenting on the issue at the moment ' , and @entity7 said it does not comment on rumour or speculation			1
if @entity7 becomes an e-money institution , it could issue units of monetary value , stored on its site , against its own worth and this emoney could be used by people throughout @entity35			1
the social network is also rumoured to have approached three @entity72 startups – @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 - that already offer international money transfer via smartphone apps			1
while @entity79 users may be wary of the security implications of storing money on @entity7 , a move into remittances would help @entity7 gain an even stronger foothold in emerging markets including @entity86 and @entity87			1
while @entity7 has not commented on the rumours a source , said to be familiar with the details , told @entity33 : ‘ @entity7 wants to become a utility in the developing world and remittances are a gateway drug to financial inclusion			1
’ if those in developing nations flock to @entity7 , the company would boost its advertising revenues , and e-money services could become a big attraction - it would be particularly useful to users in areas without easy access to banks			1
@entity106 , lecturer in @entity107 at the @entity108 ( @entity108 ) , told @entity60 : ' the materiality of banking and finance is changing rapidly and this change is most visible in emerging markets where they do not have the infrastructure in place			1
so it is a clean slate for new technology			0
' this is clearly evident in @entity87			0
@entity7 wants in on the game and the huge potential market			2
' she explained that there are two - and - a - half billion ' unbanked ' adults across the globe and so the potential market is huge			0
recent research undertaken by @entity128 found that internet use in @entity87 is on a par with @entity131 and @entity132 and therefore emoney ' is not a crazy idea ' in emerging economies			1
dr @entity106 said : ' customer branch banking is not only rapidly changing in industrialised economies but is no longer a viable option for the expansion of retail banking and financial services in @entity87 countries of large unbanked populations			2
' the challenge for bankers and credit providers is to think how financial services can expand without the characteristic physical attributes of bricks - and - mortar branch banks			0
' challenges such as varying levels of literacy , great distances , the widespread absence of formal financial services and infrastructure , lack of official identification documentation , as well as the mobility of populations , make the future of banking in @entity87 reliant on information technology and digital technology			2
she added : ' technology is having a bigger impact in developing world than in the west			0
' an alternative to cash machines : the service could allow people to store money on @entity7 , transfer it to other users and pay for goods the social network announced last week that it now has more than 100million users in @entity86 , making it the company 's largest source of users after the @entity182			1
@entity7 is not the only internet giant dipping its toe into banking , however			2
@entity132 ’s @entity186 and @entity187 are turning their sites into mobile payment platforms in order to offer consumers an alternative to using their credit cards			2
@entity194 is also ramping up its mobile payments and wallet services , which has yet to be widely adopted by consumers			2
if @entity7 is authorised to have a similar arm to its business , it would need to hold € 350,000 ( £ 289,687 ) of capital and separate the same amount of money it issues			1
it is already allowed to offer some forms of money transfer in the @entity182 – but only for developers who charge users for in - app products			1
the service is already lucrative for @entity7 , which made $ 2.1billion worth of transactions from gaming apps in 2013 , according to the @entity211			2
the company takes a fee of 30 per cent for the payments , which make up around 10 per cent of its revenues			2
if you 're fed up with your bank and thinking of switching , there are plenty of incentives to @entity223 is @entity226 's five of the best current accounts is a regularly updated guide to where the best offers are			2
