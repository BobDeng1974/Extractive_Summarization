@entity1 police are testing a new non lethal attatchemt for handguns			1
it allows them to fire alloys ' ping pong balls ' - which can bring a person down but not kill them			0
this week , five instructors for the @entity12 city 's police department are training to use the device , called the @entity14			1
the $ 45 @entity26 device that attaches to the top of a normal handgun			1
the product itself only weighs about 2 ounces and sits in a small pouch on their duty belt			0
the bullet embeds itself inside the projectile without a chance of escaping it mounts to the top of an officer 's weapon within a second when the officer feels it 's an appropriate lethal force situation it extends alloy @entity22 - ball - sized projectile in front of the muzzle bullet embeds itself inside the projectile , firing it			1
the @entity51 , which reportedly intends to distribute the @entity14 to all of its officers following training , found itself at the center of national debates over policing and race relations after then - officer @entity59 shot and killed @entity60 last august			2
' the alternative was developed as a blunt force impact device to fill the void in lethal force situations , which until now could only be addressed with a firearm , ' @entity61 , the firm which designed the weapon , said			0
' concerned with the number of deaths of officers and citizens resulting when confrontations occur , where a new lethal force option would have been preferred but not readily available , we developed the @entity14			0
@entity76 , founder and ceo of @entity61 , told the @entity79 police reached out to him after the city 's assistant police chief , @entity80 , took to @entity82 and searched under the words ' less lethal			2
' ' it gives another option , ' @entity80 said of the device , which he later tested for himself , the @entity84 said			0
' i really liked it			0
. you are always looking to save a life , not take a life			0
' however , when the @entity84 asked eickhoffis the $ 45 addon could have saved @entity60 , he said : ' you could still shoot him with this round , ' the assistant police chief said , ' and he could still get up and come at you			1
' @entity76 , the chief executive of @entity61 , said he started the firm to avoid needless citizen deaths			0
the rough concept was developed several years ago by a retired sheriff 's officer from whom @entity76 said he bought the patent			0
' ask a police officer what are the options when lethal force is justified , and he 'll say , ' i have my gun and my bullets , ' ' said @entity76 , 32 , who recently began marketing the @entity14 in the @entity109 and abroad as an ' an air bag for a bullet			2
' it mounts to the top of an officer 's weapon within a second when the officer feels it 's an appropriate lethal force situation ' this technology represents a critical ' missing link ' between lethal force and less - lethal force , ' the firm claims			1
' by utilizing our bullet capture technology in appropriate situations police are likely to prevent loss of life to the public at large in a way that was – until now – not possible			2
the @entity14 is a small orange device that attaches to the top of a normal handgun and extends a @entity22 - ball - sized projectile in front of the muzzle			1
however , critics have pointed out the @entity14 resembles a clown 's nose			1
' the @entity142 , ' one critic called it			0
the @entity14 is a small orange device that attaches to the top of a normal handgun and extends a @entity22 - ball - sized projectile in front of the muzzle			1
after traveling through the barrel , the bullet embeds itself inside the alloy projectile , and the docking unit immediately detaches from the weapon			1
' once the gun is fired , the bullet embeds itself inside the projectile without a chance of escaping , simultaneously transferring the bullet 's energy as it propels it toward the target			1
' once the bullet is fired from the gun into the projectile , they permanently become one unit			2
' this process decreases the bullet 's velocity and dampens its impact			2
the bullet , then , should not pierce a human 's skin and cause the type of internal damage that would kill the person			0
however , it retains enough blunt force to knock someone over and deliver severe , debilitating pain , and travels up to 250 feet per second ( when propelled by a 9mm slug ) and sends ' a shock wave of pain through the suspect ' when it hits , @entity76 said .			0
