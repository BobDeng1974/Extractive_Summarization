he said : ' the intention was to destroy the plane			0
the plane hit the mountain at 700kmh ( 430mph )			0
' i do n't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds '			0
earlier in the flight , mr @entity215 said @entity8 's responses were initially courteous , but became ' curt ' when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing of the plane			1
the captain - named by local media as @entity143 father - of - two @entity144 - then left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter			2
mr @entity215 said : ' we hear the pilot asking the co-pilot to take over and we hear the sound of a chair being pushed back and a door closing so we assume that the captain went to the toilet or something			0
' so the co-pilot is on his own , and it is while he 's on his own that the co-pilot is in charge of the plane and uses the flight management system to start the descent of the plane			0
' at this altitude , this can only be done voluntarily			0
we hear several shouts from the captain asking to get in , speaking through the intercom system , but there 's no answer from the cockpit			0
