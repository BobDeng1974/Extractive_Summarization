a terrifying anonymous letter telling the founder of a not - for - profit to ' watch your back ' also included threats against the woman 's daughter , claiming they knew where she went to school			1
@entity11 , president and @entity13 ( @entity14 ) discovered the harrowing letter on tuesday , ahead of the release of the @entity14 app on wednesday evening			1
the free app - developed by the not - for - profit over the past 12 months - will inform consumers about the palm oil content of the products available on supermarket shelves			1
' when i opened that letter i went cold ... i took the letter and went straight to the police , ' @entity26 told @entity29			0
this anonymous letter was sent to @entity31 ( @entity14 ) president @entity32 threatening her , and her daughter and claiming to know where they live ' it 's a really gutless thing to do ... the person who sent it has been that gutless they would n't put their name to it			1
' @entity26 is the founder and president of the not - for - profit which provides information to consumers about products that contain palm oil coming from an anonymous source , the letter made claims that should their company feature ' unfavourably ' in the new app , ' we will be your worst enemy '			1
' we know you are soon to release a phone app about products with palm oil in , ' the letter began			1
' if our company is listed unfavourably we will be your worst enemy			0
' if our listing has a negative effect on our company , we know where you live , we know you have a daughter and we know where she goes to school			0
you will both need to watch your back , ' it continued			2
' you have bragged online that your app will be a ‘ game changer ’ , it well may be only not how you expect , ' the letter concluded , @entity26 said in the years since the @entity14 launched their @entity76 page - which has over 144,000 ' likes ' - they have never encouraged any consumers to boycott particular brands , but are about simply providing information			1
the letter , which was printed and not handwritten , and featured no company markings , is the first of its kind according to the @entity14 founder			2
@entity26 believes it could have come from a smaller brand they have contacted in the process of putting together their app - which acts as a barcode scanner and puts products into five categories			2
the threats came a day ahead of the release of the @entity14 app , which aims to inform consumers about the palm oil content of the products they consume the first category is palm oil free , the second indicates the company has signed on to stop deforestation , the third is palm oil certified - which means they use ethically sourced oil , the fourth is for companies or products which used a mixed supply of certified and uncertified oil , and the final is a fail			1
a fail means the company have refused to provide details when approached by @entity14 , or that they use uncertified palm oil			1
' it is going to make big waves , ' @entity26 said , speaking of the app. ' i do n’t know what this person or company thinks they ’re going to achieve			0
it 's not the correct way to approach us '			0
' whoever it is is worried … in a way that ’s a good thing because it shows the app is going to do exactly what it ’s meant to , ' she continued			0
in recent years there has been controversy over illegal deforestation in south - east @entity136 animals such as orangutans , tigers and elephants are losing their natural habitats to the deforestation as a single mother to her young daughter , the @entity14 founder said the letter was frightening , and it was now being investigated by detectives			2
and she had a message for the anonymous sender : ' if they ’re worried , why not send us a letter and say how are our brands sitting in that app … instead of sending something like that '			0
a controversial ingredient in recent years , palm oil is used in a large amount of products found on supermarket shelves , from foods to beauty and cleaning products			2
the issue surrounding the resource stems from the illegal deforestation of areas in @entity169 and @entity170 , which is having a devastating impact on the animals that call these areas home			0
orangutans , tigers , rhinoceroses and elephants are among the native animals which face extinction as more and more land is cleared to harvest the cheap oil			0
harvesting the crops from which the oil comes from is not the issue at the centre of the debate , rather the uncertified and dangerous ways the resource is being collected and sold .			0
