an exhausted kestrel which found itself 25 miles out to sea hitched a ride back to shore on the shoulder of a yachtswoman			2
@entity6 , 57 , was sailing to the @entity8 coast from the @entity9 with husband @entity10 , 55 , when she felt a tapping on her neck			1
she turned to her left and saw the large bird of prey - normally only found on dry land - staring back at her			1
hitching a ride : a wayward kestrel landed on a @entity8 couple 's yacht in the middle of the @entity21 ' like a seasoned sailor ' : having tried and failed to take flight again , the bird settled down in the cockpit the kestrel , which they 've since nicknamed @entity28 , then hopped onto the deck of the 30ft @entity31 pilot cutter before becoming spooked and taking off again			1
but the battered bird could only circle the mast once before flopping into the water			0
fortunately it mustered enough energy to flap back on board , and sat with its new shipmates for the next four hours			1
it eventually left @entity6 and @entity10 as they sailed into the mouth of the river @entity43 , @entity8			1
it is believed the wayward animal had been blown off course by strong easterly winds			0
@entity6 , an occupational therapist of @entity48 , @entity8 , said : ' there was nothing in sight except a nearby wind farm			1
exhausted : the bird eventually left the yacht four hours later , when it reached the @entity43 ' so i was completely stunned when the bird landed my shoulder			1
we just could not work out how a land bird was so far out at sea			0
' my shock must have made it decide to move off and it then settled among the coiled mainsheet by my side			0
' we tried to give her food as she looked absolutely famished but it seemed to spook her and she took flight - weirdly landing on the water			2
' as she is a land bird we became terrified that she might drown as she would have no natural swimming skills			0
' but she managed to regain herself before landing on my husband ’s shoulder and then settled down on the boat and stayed with us for four - and - a - half hours			1
' she was like a seasoned sailor and just pottered about the boat and did seem to care about us at all			0
' she must have realised we posed no threat and were her only chance of survival			0
the kestrel eventually left us when we reached the @entity43			1
' she then flew top @entity81 which overlooks the river , perhaps for a quick prayer of thanksgiving or more likely a hunt for a long awaited meal of @entity81 mouse			2
' @entity10 , a local scout leader and technical designer for @entity90 , was astonished when the bird landed on his wife ’s shoulder			1
he said : ' i could not believe it			0
it is odd to see a bird of prey so far out to see but for it to land on my wife ’s shoulder completely out of the blue is just incredible			2
' there was a strong easterly wind at the time so we think it must have been blown out to sea from the @entity8 coat			1
' it would have died if our boat was not there			0
you hear about these stories out at sea but you never think they will happen to you - it was really fascinating			0
' kestrels are usually found in open farm land or near uncultivated grassland			0
they are a a bird of prey and tend to eat field voles , mice , shrews , moles , rats , frogs , and lizards			0
the species is in decline in the @entity127 due to the loss of food and farmland habitat .			2
