by @entity0 published : 17:34 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 18:47 est , 30 april 2013 justice secretary @entity1 wants to halt @entity3 's compensation culture insurance premiums are expected to fall as ministers attempt to halt the gravy train for ‘ ambulance - chasing ’ lawyers			1
justice secretary @entity1 will say today it is time to ‘ turn the tide on @entity3 ’s compensation culture ’ as he sets out reforms designed to slash rip - off legal fees and prevent insurers , claims firms and garages selling on details of accident victims			1
so - called ‘ referral fees ’ are being banned , and the fees lawyers can make from processing basic claims for minor injuries suffered in road accidents will be cut by more than half from £ 1,200 to £ 500			1
the government is also imposing new limits on what lawyers can earn from controversial ‘ no win , no fee ’ cases			1
experts predict a 10 to 15 per cent drop in motoring premiums over the next 12 months as the changes take effect			2
the existing system has pushed up legal costs and damages , and is blamed for a boom in whiplash injury claims , making car cover more expensive for all			1
ministers say it has also forced up insurance premiums in other areas , leaving schools , community groups and local authorities fearful of staging events and activities			0
mr @entity1 told the @entity51 : ‘ we are turning the tide on the compensation culture			1
it ’s pushing up the cost of insurance , and making it more expensive to drive a car or organise an event			2
it ’s time the whole system was rebalanced			0
’ referral fees were legalised in 2004 by the last @entity63 government , leading to a boom in the claims management industry			0
the cost of personal injury claims doubled to £ 14billion in ten years			1
police , insurance companies , unscrupulous lawyers and breakdown firms have been accused of conspiring to profit from unsuspecting members of the public			0
fees are paid to claims management companies , garages and insurance firms which provide details of accidents to personal injury lawyers in a business estimated to have been worth £ 3billion a year			1
claims managers then bombard motorists with texts and phone calls offering to help them to pursue compensation claims for alleged injuries			0
the practice of referral fees has also left many hospitals , local councils and businesses with large legal bills			0
personal injury work is worth around £ 1.8billion a year for solicitors , while the @entity96 is paying more than £ 1billion a year in damages			0
the @entity98 , which has just come into effect , prohibits payment and receipt of referral fees in personal injury cases by solicitors , claims management companies and insurers			2
claims firms are also being banned from offering upfront cash incentives or other gifts to those who bring cases to them			0
mr @entity1 said that fees in ‘ no win , no fee ’ cases in the civil courts would also be limited			1
previously , it has been possible to claim a ‘ success fee ’ on top of damages from defendants , often doubling what lawyers earn			2
now , defendants will have to pay only the damages and the lawyer ’s basic fee			0
from july , mr @entity1 said , a system used to settle payouts for road accidents quickly and simply without expensive court cases will be extended to also include claims for accidents at work and in public places			2
the so - called ‘ claims portal ’ will also start handling claims up to the value of £ 25,000 , up from £ 10,000 now			2
the minister also promised action to crack down on the spiralling number of whiplash claims			0
the @entity144 has consulted on proposals to set up independent medical panels to improve injury assessment and allow the more questionable claims to be more easily challenged in court by insurers			0
@entity151 , director of @entity152 , said : ‘ the reforms should go some way towards bringing “ no win , no fee ” type whiplash injury claims under control and will thus reduce the costs of claims			1

justice secretary @entity1 wants to ‘ turn the tide on @entity3 ’s compensation culture ’
the fees lawyers can make for processing minor injury claims are to be reduced by more than half
new limits will be placed on ' no win , no fee ' cases
the cost of car insurance could fall 10 - 15 per cent as a result of reduced payouts
