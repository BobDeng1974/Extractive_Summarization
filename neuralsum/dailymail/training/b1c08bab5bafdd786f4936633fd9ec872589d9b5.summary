a gay teen in @entity1 says he quit his job at fast - food chain @entity3 's after a manager forced him to wear a name tag reading ' @entity6 ' - and now he 's looking into legal action			1
however , the @entity10 franchise 's manager disputes 16 - year - old @entity12 's claims , saying he came up with the name - tag nickname himself			1
the alleged incident took place monday night , when @entity12 says his ' agitated ' and ' verbally abusive ' manager pulled him into the office and gave him the name tag with ' @entity6 ' on it while laughing			1
' i put it on because i did n't want to upset him and i felt that if i did do anything to upset him , it would cause me to lose my job because he 'd be looking for ways to fire me , ' @entity30 told @entity37			0
he says he spent the night standing behind the till so customers would n't see the homophobic slur on his name tag , but @entity12 says his manager continued to call him by the name across the store			1
@entity12 tried taking off the tag several times , but his manager kept telling him to put it back on			1
singled out : @entity12 , pictured in photo posted to @entity47 , says he 's looking into suing the franchise for discrimination by 11:30pm , @entity12 was so frustrated that he asked how long was left in the shift , at which point the manager yelled and him and told him to ' get the f * * * out ' of the restaurant			1
after talking about the situation with his boyfriend and other friends , @entity12 decided to resign the next morning			2

however , restaurant manager @entity63 says he did n't force @entity64 to wear the name tag , and did n't come up with the nickname			1
' he asked the manager to make that name tag for him , ' @entity63 told the @entity67			2
' he ( the manager ) did n't tell him he had to wear it			2
( @entity12 ) put it on himself and created the situation			0
' but @entity12 says that idea is offensive			1
' do you really think i 'd want to go around making a mockery of who i am ? ' it 's really irritating to think someone could believe i would want that label			0
