a team of scientists who were given the go - ahead by @entity4 to crowd - fund the revival of a seemingly ' dead ' spacecraft have announced their mission was successful			1
contact was last made with the spacecraft , called @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , in the late 90s			2
as it approached our planet , scientists had a brief chance to communicate with the 36 - year - old probe in an attempt to bring it back to life - which they have now managed to do			2
@entity4 has officially endorsed an amateur group , known as the the @entity21 , for them to attempt to bring a vintage spacecraft , called @entity11 , back to life			1
pictured is an artist 's concept image of @entity11 ‘ the @entity21 is pleased to announce that our team has established two - way communication with the @entity11 spacecraft and has begun commanding it to perform specific functions , ’ one of the team ’s leaders , @entity27 , wrote on @entity30			1
‘ over the coming days and weeks our team will make an assessment of the spacecraft 's overall health and refine the techniques required to fire its engines and bring it back to an orbit near @entity44			1
’ the team will then decide what sort of mission they intend to send the spacecraft on			2
according to @entity27 , ‘ first contact with @entity11 was achieved at the @entity50 in @entity51			0
’ the achievement was a collaboration with a number of other organisations and people including the staff at @entity58 and a team at the @entity60 in @entity61			0
in april the @entity59 - made up of the groups @entity30 , @entity63 , and @entity64 - undertook a successful crowd funding project to raise £ 74,000 ( $ 125,000 ) to rescue the probe			2
@entity4 officially endorsed the @entity68 - based project and signed a space act agreement for the group to take command and control of the 1970s - era craft			1
this is the first time @entity4 has worked on such an agreement for use of a spacecraft the agency is no longer using or ever planned to use again			1
' we contacted the spacecraft after recreating hardware that was discarded by @entity4 decades ago using command language that was recreated from old documents that were sitting in former employees ' basements , ' @entity79 tells @entity87			0
' now that we have taken command of the spacecraft we will study its current condition and then prepare to fire its engines			0
' we need to fire the engines soon - within the month of june - to put @entity11 - 3 into an orbit close to @entity44			1
' if we manage to accomplish all of this then we intend to use the spacecraft for science again - and to involve citizens in its operation in a way not yet attempted			0
' @entity11 was the first satellite to study the constant flow of solar wind streaming toward @entity44 from a stable orbit point between our planet and the sun known as the lagrangian 1 , or @entity109			2
monitoring that wind helped scientists better understand the interconnected sun - @entity44 system , which at its most turbulent can affect satellites around @entity44			1
in 1984 , it was given a new mission and called the @entity11			0
in september 1985 , it passed through the tail of @entity118 , making it the first spacecraft to gather data from a comet			0
it also went on to fly by @entity124 in march 1986			0
from 1991 until 1997 , when it was too far away for reliable communications , this satellite continued to investigate the sun. now it 's coming home to visit - making its closest approach to @entity44 in august			2
‘ the intrepid @entity11 spacecraft was sent away from its primary mission to study the physics of the solar wind extending its mission of discovery to study two comets , ’ said @entity4 astronaut @entity131 last week			1
‘ we have a chance to engage a new generation of citizen scientists through this creative effort to recapture the @entity11 spacecraft as it zips by the @entity44 this summer			1
’ in march , amateur radio astronomers were able to track the spacecraft and find out its route , raising hopes that the mission could be revived			0
launched in 1978 to study the constant flow of solar wind streaming toward @entity44 , @entity11 - 3 successfully completed its prime mission in 1981			1
with remaining fuel and functioning instruments , it then was redirected to observe two comets			0
following the end of that mission , the spacecraft continued in orbit around the sun. it is now making its closest approach to @entity44 in more than 30 years			2
the goal of the @entity21 is to put the spacecraft into an orbit at a gravitationally stable point between @entity44 and the sun known as @entity165 1 ( @entity109 )			2
once safely back in orbit , the next step would be to return the spacecraft to operations and use its instruments as they were originally designed			0
the mission 's original communication hardware no longer exists , so controlling the spacecraft required the amateur group to create virtual software versions of the original hardware			1
once proving this was possible , the project is now using the @entity50 ( pictured ) in @entity51 to send commands to @entity11 @entity11 's close approach provided optimal conditions to attempt communication			0
@entity4 said it has shared technical data with the amateur group to help them communicate with and return data from @entity11			1
the mission ’s original communication hardware no longer exists , so controlling the spacecraft will require the amateur group to create virtual software versions of the original hardware			1
if they are able to do this , the project will use the @entity50 in @entity51 to send commands to @entity11			0
new data resulting from the project will be shared with the science community and the public , providing a unique tool for teaching students and the public about spacecraft operations and data gathering			0
the data also will provide valuable information about the effects of the space environment on the 36 - year old spacecraft .			0

a @entity68 - based amateur group has succeeded in reviving a ' dead ' probe
the crowd - funded @entity21 has ' talked ' with the spacecraft
the team will now assess the health of @entity11 over the coming weeks
this is the first time @entity4 has given control of one of its craft to the public
@entity11 - 3 first launched in 1978 but has not been heard from since 1999
reviving the mission could help scientists better understand solar winds which can affect satellites and the *climate* on @entity44
