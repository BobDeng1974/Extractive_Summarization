ministers claim foreign lorries are likely to cause more damage to @entity5 roads and they should make a contribution to their upkeep			2
complex rules mean @entity5 lorry drivers will have also have to pay the @entity27 but will receive a rebate in the form of a cut to vehicle excise duty			2
transport minister @entity32 said : ‘ the government believes that it is right that vehicles which cause wear to our roads should make a payment to take account of this			0
‘ hgvs registered abroad are likely to carry more weight on fewer axles than @entity5 registered vehicles			2
' this means that foreign - registered vehicles are more damaging to the roads and it 's therefore all the more unjust that they do n't make a contribution towards the maintenance of the roads they use , leaving the burden to fall entirely on the @entity5 taxpayer			0
’ the levy is expected to raise between £ 18.7 million and £ 23.1 million in its first year of operation , starting in april 2014			1

shadow transport minister @entity84 added : ‘ the unfairness dealt to the @entity5 road haulage industry is well documented and they have long pressed for this measure to defend @entity5 industry , to protect @entity5 roads and to create a level playing field with their @entity94 competitors			0
