you might think you have to pay through the nose at the moment to access the @entity3			0
but one ambitious organisation called the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) is planning to turn the age of online computing on its head by giving free web access to every person on @entity11			1
known as @entity12 , @entity5 plans to launch hundreds of satellites into orbit by 2015			1
and they say the project could provide unrestricted internet access to countries where their web access is censored , including @entity19 and @entity20			1
the @entity22 company plans to ask @entity23 to test their outernet technology on the @entity25 ( left ) so that they can begin broadcasting @entity27 to web users around the world ( right ) using something known as datacasting technology , which involves sending data over wide radio waves , the @entity22 - based company says they 'll be able to broadcast the internet around the world			0
the group is hoping to raise tens of millions of dollars in donations to get the project on the road			0
the outernet team claim that only 60 % of the world 's population currently have access to the wealth of knowledge that can be found on the @entity3			0
this is because , despite a wide spread of @entity27 devices across the globe , many countries are unable or unwilling to provide people with the infrastructure needed to access the web			2
the @entity12 project is aiming to raise tens of millions of dollars to launch hundreds of miniature satellites known as cubesats to make their dream a reality the company 's plan is to launch hundreds of low - cost miniature satellites , known as cubesats , into low @entity11 orbit			1
here , each satellite will receive data from a network of ground stations across the globe			0
using a technique known as @entity73 ( @entity73 ) multitasking , which is the sharing of data between users on a network , @entity12 will beam information to users			0
much like how you receive a signal on your television and flick through channels , @entity12 will broadcast the internet to you and allow you to flick through certain websites			2
by june of this year the @entity12 project aims to begin deploying prototype satellites to test their technology in september 2014 they will make a request to @entity23 to test their technology on the @entity25 by early 2015 they intend to begin manufacturing and launching their satellites and in june 2015 the company says they will begin broadcasting the @entity12 from space ' we have a very solid understand of the costs involved , as well as experience working on numerous spacecraft , ' said @entity98 of @entity99 , who fielded some questions on @entity101			1
' there is n't a lot of raw research that is being done here ; much of what is being described has already been proven by other small satellite programs and experiments			0
there 's really nothing that is technically impossible to this ' but at the prospect of telecoms operators trying to shut the project down before it gets off the ground , @entity99 said : ' we will fight ... and win			2
' if everything goes to plan , the @entity12 project aims to ask @entity23 for permission to test the technology on the @entity25			2
and their ultimate goal will be to beginning deploying the @entity12 satellites into @entity11 orbit , which they say can begin in june 2015 .			1

an ambitious project known as @entity12 is aiming to launch hundreds of miniature satellites into low @entity11 orbit by june 2015
each satellite will broadcast the internet to phones and computers giving billions of people across the globe free online access
*citizens* of countries like @entity19 and @entity20 that have censored online activity could be given free and unrestricted cyberspace
' there 's really nothing that is technically impossible to this '
