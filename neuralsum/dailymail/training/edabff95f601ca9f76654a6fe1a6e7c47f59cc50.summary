by @entity0 published : 08:31 est , 13 july 2012 updated : 11:00 est , 13 july 2012 we all have days when we 'd like to lose a little weight here or a love - handle there			1
but one @entity7 geography teacher who spent 15 years unhappy with his size has been crowned a slimming champion after losing almost 11 stone in just one year			1
a newly svelte @entity11 , 30 , who lives in @entity12 , says his family and friends no longer recognise him after his weight plummeted from 23st 13lb to 13st 6lbs			1
a shadow of my former self : geography teacher @entity11 , who lost over 10 stone and has been crowned @entity22 's @entity21 2012 at the @entity23 , poses with a cardboard cutout of his larger self just last year , aged 29 , mr @entity11 vowed to lose the weight as a 30th birthday present to himself			1
he made the decision after realising he had been steadily gaining weight since the age of 15 and had been frustrated with his size for half his life			1
mr @entity11 , who has been crowned @entity22 's @entity21 2012 at @entity33 's @entity23 , said : ' i 've had people i know walk past me in the street			1
they 're always really apologetic but i actually take it as a huge compliment			2
' speaking about his dramatic transformation , mr @entity11 said : ' at 15 i was just a little bit overweight but i did n't do anything about it and i got bigger and bigger			1
' whenever i felt unhappy , whether it was about my weight or something else , i 'd cheer myself up by buying something nice to eat like a cake or a pie			2
' it carried on like that for the next 15 years			2
i always knew i needed to do something about my weight but i did n't know what , so i 'd put it to the back of my mind			2
' now you see him ... and now you do n't : geography teacher @entity11 , left , before losing the weight , and now , right , almost 11 stone lighter and ' finally fit at 30 ' mr @entity11 , who is single , eventually decided to tackle his weight problem when one of his friends asked how he was planning to celebrate his 30th birthday			1
he said : ' that was the trigger because i realised then that i 'd been unhappy with my size for half of my life			0
winning smile : @entity11 with his award for @entity22 's @entity21 in the garden of the @entity23 in @entity33 ' i asked my colleague @entity72 , who had lost a lot of weight , about the @entity75 she went to and agreed to go with her			1
' she was delighted because she got a free week for bringing along a new member ! ' the teacher signed up to the programme - which promotes healthy eating and meal plans - in june 2011 and lost five stone before the school holidays were over			0
when he returned to the classroom with his new , smaller body he received rapturous applause from his pupils			0
by his 30th birthday in september mr @entity11 had dropped six stone			1
he said that before going to his first @entity22 meeting he was really nervous as he had the impression there would be lots of women in the group			0
' and to be fair there was , but they were all really welcoming and friendly '			0
he says the biggest change is learning to plan his meals : ' i never used to think about what i 'd have for dinner until i was on my way home , which means i 'd pick up a takeaway or grab something quick and easy - and usually unhealthy - from the supermarket			0
' since joining @entity22 i enjoy cooking meals from scratch , my favourite is homemade burgers and potato wedges with salad			0
' food is n't my comfort blanket anymore either , although i do have an emergency @entity115 in my classroom - but so far i 'm one of the few teachers who has n't broken it out			0
' mr @entity11 revealed that another secret to his dramatic weight - loss was becoming more active			1
last year he began walking more , and he also went swimming for the first time in 12 years			0
he said : ' as a geography teacher i go on lots of trips			0
i used to huff and puff my way up mountains , following the kids while someone else led , but now i 'm first off the bus and charging up the hill			0
' the kids at school have been really supportive and asked lots of questions , someone even asked if they could write a magazine article on me for their coursework which was very flattering			0
' i think it 's important to be honest with them and i always say i wish i 'd done something at their age , but at least i can say i finally got fit at 30			2
