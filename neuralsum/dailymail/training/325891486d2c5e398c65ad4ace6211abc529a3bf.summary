the mastermind behind two hit @entity2 games has been asked by a former @entity4 official to help policy advisors imagine future wars @entity7 may have to fight			1
@entity8 , whose blockbuster gaming franchise has earned billions of dollars , is among a group of writers and producers enlisted by the @entity13 to look at how armed conflicts might evolve in the @entity15			1
the initiative , @entity16 , which launches this week , was born when @entity18 , a former @entity4 official now at the @entity13 , found himself impressed by the story line of a video game his son was playing			1
pictured is a scene from @entity2 : @entity28 , due out in november the game , call of duty : @entity31 , depicts a cold war set in 2025 between @entity33 and the @entity7 , with the rival powers vying for coveted rare earth elements			1
' he was struck how realistic our portrayal in @entity2 : @entity31 was of a future conflict , ' @entity8 told @entity40 in an interview			1
to come up with that game 's plot , @entity8 gathered an eclectic group that included screenwriter @entity47 , who worked on the @entity49 films ; author @entity50 who has written about drone warfare ; and @entity52 , the retired @entity43 officer turned television personality who rose to fame in the @entity56 of the 1980s			1
former @entity4 official @entity18 was struck by how realistic call of duty : @entity31 ( pictured ) was in portraying future conflicts , creator @entity8 said ' you get everybody in a room like that , and all the different perspectives come together , ' @entity8 said from his home in @entity65 , @entity66			1
' that combination was fascinating			2
what i would like to bring to @entity70 is that kind of thinking			2
' the @entity72 - born @entity8 , 41 , said there is no shortage of scenarios outlining future threats to the @entity7 , with a plethora of experts , books and films forecasting dangers on the horizon			1
' the problem is we 're not preparing for it			0
and the government is not set up to prepare for it			0
that 's what i want to question			0
' what can we do about that ? ' @entity8 said ' the stock answers are - " well , we do n't have the money for it " or " we ca n't possibly predict what 's coming next so why bother "			1
that 's what i want to blow apart			0
' the @entity13 said it had sought out @entity8 because national security decision makers can not keep up with the frenetic pace of change in the world , and that ' new voices ' are needed to make sense of a chaotic landscape			2
@entity72 - born @entity8 , 41 , said there is no shortage of scenarios outlining future threats to the @entity7			1
pictured are @entity43 in @entity109 ' writers , directors and producers and other artists bring to bear observations derived from wholly different experiences in the creative world , ' the council said in a statement			0
' they can ask different kinds of questions that will challenge assumptions and status quo ways of tackling some of today 's toughest national security problems			0
' instead of a power point presentation , common at think tanks , @entity8 plans to show slick videos when he appears at the program 's launch in @entity70 on tuesday			1
one of them will force the audience to confront the possibility of an assault in @entity133 similar to the 2008 attacks on @entity135			0
@entity8 , whose @entity2 series has a hotly - anticipated new installment due out in november , said his experience running a multi-billion dollar production company has some parallels to government work			2
there are billions of dollars at stake , intense pressures and ' inflexible ' thinking among corporate executives that has to be overcome			0
the @entity7 government and military also face a dilemma trying to adapt amid uncertainty , but @entity8 argues the greatest danger is refusing to take any risks			1
' the way i like to think about it is the next attack has already happened , someone has already thought of it			0
how do you look at all the ideas that are out there ? ' he said			0
' the problem is the next attack is very unlikely to be the same as the previous attack			0
' as the @entity7 presses an air war against the @entity170 group in @entity171 and @entity172 , the potential danger from the militants will not come in a conventional way , he said			2
' the threat may well be that you have 100 @entity176 ( is ) loyalists in the country , today right now as we speak , and who may simultaneously attack soft targets			2
' i think this is going to be the next 9/11			0
' it was time to start preparing for such dire scenarios , he said			0
' why are our heads in the sand - pretending to ourselves that this wo n't happen on @entity7 soil ? ... what could we be doing about that right now ? '			2
