by @entity0 published : 12:54 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 12:54 est , 7 november 2012 the development of ' high tech ' long range weapons 71,000 years ago in @entity5 gave humans the killing edge which helped make us the dominant species , a new study suggests			1
finds in @entity5 suggest that by the time our ancestors began to spread across the planet they had developed advanced weapons that made them more than a match for @entity16 rivals			1
research on stone tools and @entity16 anatomy strongly suggests that our now - extinct sister species lacked true projectile weapons			1
neanderthals watch out : this reconstruction of a homo sapiens hunting party from the @entity26 documentary @entity25 shows how our ancestors might have wielded their ' high tech ' weapons ' when @entity29 left @entity5 and entered @entity16 territory they had projectiles with greater killing reach , and these early moderns probably also had higher levels of pro-social ( hyper - cooperative ) behaviour , ' said @entity36 , project director and @entity38 professor in the @entity39			1
' these two traits were a knockout punch			0
combine them , as modern humans did and still do , and no prey or competitor is safe			2
' this probably laid the foundation for the expansion @entity49 of modern humans and the extinction of many prey as well as our sister species such as @entity16			2
' the findings at @entity55 , near @entity56 , also suggest that modern man may have evolved in this region as the @entity60 technology found only took hold in other areas of @entity5 and @entity63 about 50,000 years later			1
' every time we excavate a new site in coastal @entity5 with advanced field techniques , we discover new and surprising results that push back in time the evidence for uniquely human behaviours , ' said professor @entity36			1
these microlith blades show a flat side and a rounded ' cutting ' edge : it is believed they were used in light armaments for use as projectiles , either as arrows for bows , or as spears for throwers known as atlatls the dig : the excavation site preserves about 14m of archaeological sediment dating from approximately 90,000 to 50,000 years ago			1
almost 200,000 finds have been plotted to date , and excavations continue the study , published in today 's issue of the journal nature , found that the technology focused on the careful production of long , thin blades of stone that were then blunted on one edge so that they could be glued into slots carved in wood or bone			2
this created light armaments for use as projectiles , either as arrows in bow and arrow technology , or more likely as spear throwers , known as atlatls			0
they provide a significant advantage by increasing the killing reach of the hunter and lowering the risk of injury			0
@entity115 are the only modern humans whose ancestors apparently did not interbreed with @entity16 , new research suggests			0
scientists studying human genetic ancestry have found that , like modern @entity63 peoples , modern @entity120 also carry genetic traces which suggest some @entity16 ancestry			0
neanderthals were a closely related species of humans who thrived in @entity127 and the @entity128 during the last @entity129 but died out around 30,000 years ago			2
genetic evidence published in 2010 suggests they interbred with the ancestors of some modern humans , with as much as 1 to 4 per cent of modern @entity63 genomes containing @entity16 dna			2
the stone used to produce these special blades was carefully transformed for easier flaking by a complex process called ' heat treatment , ' a technological advance also appearing early in coastal @entity5			1
' good things come in small packages , ' said @entity144 , a stone tool replicator and co-author			0
' when we started to find these very small carefully made tools , we were glad that we had saved and sorted even the smallest of our sieved materials			0
' at sites excavated less carefully , these microliths may have been discarded in the back dirt or never identified in the lab. ' this microlithic technology appear briefly between 65,000 and 60,000 years ago during a worldwide glacial phase , and then was thought to vanish , showing what many scientists accept as a ' flickering ' pattern of advanced technologies in @entity5			1
this pattern was thought to result from small populations struggling during harsh climate phases , inventing technologies , and then losing them due to chance occurrences wiping out the artisans with the special knowledge			0
' eleven thousand years of continuity is , in reality , an almost unimaginable time span for people to consistently make tools the same way , ' said professor @entity36			0
' this is certainly not a flickering pattern			0
' the appearance and disappearance is more likely a function of the small sample of well - excavated sites in @entity5			2
because of this small sample , each new site has a high probability of adding a novel observation			0
birthplace of the first humans ? @entity55 on the southern coast of @entity5			1
it is thought modern man may have evolved in this region as the technology found here only emerged elsewhere about 50,000 years later the @entity29 sample is a tiny fraction of the known @entity127 sample from the same time period			1
' this is why continued and well - funded fieldwork in @entity5 is of the highest scientific priority if we want to learn about what it means to be human , and where and when it happened , ' said professor @entity36			2
the excavation site preserves about 14m of archaeological sediment dating from approximately 90,000 to 50,000 years ago			1
every observed item related to human behaviour was plotted directly to a computer using a ' total station ' - a surveying instrument that digitally captures points where items are found to create a 3d model of the excavation			0
almost 200,000 finds have been plotted to date , and excavations continue			0
' as an archaeologist and scientist , it is a privilege to work on a site that preserves a near perfect layered sequence capturing almost 50,000 years of human prehistory , ' said mr @entity144 , who codirected excavations			0
' our team has done a remarkable job of identifying some of the subtle but important clues to just how innovative these early humans on the south coast were			1

archaeological finds in @entity5 dating back 71,000 years are the earliest evidence of humans making projectile weapons
the findings at @entity55 , near @entity56 , suggest this could be the the region were early humans first emerged
