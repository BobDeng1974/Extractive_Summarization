by @entity1 reporter nine in ten people have no idea when well - known fruit and vegetables are in season , according to a poll			2
less than 10 per cent of those asked could name the seasonal months for home - grown produce such as plums , blackberries and asparagus			1
the survey by @entity15 found that just 4 per cent of people could correctly say when plums were in season and 5 per cent knew the three months blackberries were ripe for eating , while 10 per cent guessed correctly for gooseberries , and 9 per cent for outdoor rhubarb			1
the scores were just as low for vegetables , with only 7 per cent correctly naming that asparagus is in season in april , may and june			0
the best performance was for new potatoes , but only 13 per cent correctly named may , june and july as the key months			0
the poll of more than 2,000 people found that 11 per cent could get the seasonal months for corn on the cob correct , and 12 per cent for pumpkins , but only 9 per cent could correctly name the months when broad beans were at their peak			1
despite the lack of knowledge , the vast majority of people thought it was important to shop seasonally , with 78 per cent claiming to look actively for food that is in season			1
but only a third felt that supermarkets helped them to shop seasonally			2
more than four fifths of those who tried to shop seasonally said they wanted to support @entity25 farmers , while almost three quarters wanted fresher produce and 70 per cent were keen for a better taste			2
of those who did not actively look for produce that was in season , almost half said it was because they wanted to eat their favourite food all year round , while 39 per cent admitted to being unaware of what the seasons for food were			0
the majority found it important to shop seasonally , with 78 per cent claiming to look actively for seasonal food @entity71 , @entity15 @entity15 editor , said : ' cooking with the seasons has always given a delicious structure to the cook 's calendar , but our survey shows this traditional rhythm is under threat			1
' although many of the respondents could hazard a guess , very few knew the exact months that produce was in season			0
' the good news for @entity25 producers is that most people want to do more to specifically support them			0
the survey should be food for thought for supermarkets whose customers feel they are not helping them to shop seasonally			2
' writing in the september issue of @entity15 @entity15 investigative food journalist @entity94 said : ' the supermarkets ' obsession with stocking every fruit and vegetable grown on the planet , every day of the year , makes it hard to detect the ebb and flow of seasonal produce			1
' she said food seasons were also being blurred by changes to the weather			0
but she said : ' buying fruit and vegetables at their seasonal peak has always been the surest way to nose out the freshest , best - tasting , ripest produce , and that guiding principle is as relevant as it ever was			0

less than 10 per cent could name seasonal months for home - grown produce
people were *stumped* at when plums , blackberries and asparagus were ripe
@entity15 @entity15 found *23* per cent knew when strawberries grew
although the vast majority of people found it important to shop seasonally
