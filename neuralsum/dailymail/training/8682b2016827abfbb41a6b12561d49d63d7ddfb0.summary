@entity0 showed real bottle and character to beat @entity3			1
it was a high - pressure game after a patchy autumn and regaining momentum to mount a successful @entity7 campaign would have been very tough if they had lost			1
but win they did and now @entity0 are in pretty good shape			2
they all need to have a look in the mirror , though , especially the @entity0 coaches as they all seemed a little too pleased after the game - as if this was all part of some grand master plan			1
there is a mountain of work awaiting them			0
here are the lessons @entity0 ( and the other main nations ) should take on board			1
@entity24 gives out a scream of joy after scoring @entity0 's first try against @entity3 on saturday @entity0 have fought hard for victory but they , and the other home nations , have a lot still to learn @entity31 @entity32 has the playing talent to build a truly successful side			1
@entity0 got it right at the death but for much of the autumn it was a very confused picture			2
@entity38 or @entity39 should always have started at @entity40			0
it is clear now that @entity42 was n’t match fit			0
@entity24 should have started at no 8 from the off			0
meanwhile , how can @entity45 go from first - choice wing against @entity47 , when he hardly touched the ball , to being out of the squad ? the same applies to @entity50			0
how are they feeling ? it is up to their clubs to pick up the pieces			0
long - term coaching contracts hinder selection			2
it appears as though the pressure @entity0 were under against @entity3 brought clarity of thought for the first time			1
@entity39 ( left ) or @entity38 ( right ) should always start at 10 for @entity0 from now on @entity45 ( left ) was dropped out of the blue and @entity24 should have been first - choice no 8 front five superstars @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 were the stand - outs , the bench forwards were strong and there are other top - class operators who will push hard for selection when they return from injury			1
@entity0 ’s front five can make @entity79 a horrible place for any visiting team			1
can a front five win a @entity7 for you ? yes , but @entity0 must use them even more effectively			1
can @entity0 stop referring to all the @entity85 they have to come back ? it belittles the fantastic efforts of those currently wearing the @entity0 shirt			2
there is no guarantee those @entity85 will make the team and somehow suggests the @entity85 ranks above @entity0			1
@entity0 's scrum was dominant and @entity3 simply did not know how to deal with it on saturday @entity32 has a front five that are simply incredible and they can dominate any side at @entity79 get the balance right there is a need for lightning - quick ball from @entity0 ’s back row at the breakdown			1
@entity103 , @entity24 and @entity104 went well but there is plenty they must work on			0
@entity0 need more ball carrying and hard yards from them			2
it was a good decision to drop @entity104 for @entity112 , a little kick up the rear , and he responded			0
the combination between @entity104 and @entity24 for the first try was nice to see , as was @entity24 playing 80 minutes			0
@entity103 , up against @entity117 , produced some key turnovers			0
@entity103 ( right ) did well at the breakdown and @entity0 must get the balance right in the back row @entity104 ( right ) responded well after being dropped and was excellent against @entity3 get your kicks @entity0 need to think carefully about their goal - kicking because their power up front and ability to play in the opposition half will earn plenty of penalties			1
and kickers invariably win @entity133			0
@entity38 looks reliable close - in but mid-range and long - range , he does not yet have test match consistency			0
he will work on that			0
making a decision to play @entity42 at 12 offers a very strong mid-range goal - kicking option which will tip the balance his way in selection			2
@entity38 's kicking from short range is excellent but he struggles a bit from middle distances @entity42 ( right ) should be considered as a no 12 for @entity0 due to his exemplary middle - range kicking look for drop goals a drop - goal game can be a real weapon , and not just going into the last 10 minutes of tight games			1
i ’d like to see us dropping goals in the first minute , especially when momentum is lost in attack			0
there is nothing more dispiriting for a defending side , as you can not defend against it			0
with a dominant front five , how many drop goals could @entity0 deliver in one game ? i have always believed in building the score in order to get one and then two scores ahead			1
i believe 13 is a lucky number			0
if you gain a lead of 13 points , you should always win			0
drop goals are a great short cut to reach that magic number			0
@entity0 must look for drop goals , like @entity176 's in 2003 @entity7 final , throughout entire matches must get fitter @entity0 are still not fit enough			1
there is plenty of time to put that right , but it will require strong co-operation between the clubs and @entity0 , and i worry whether that partnership will stand the test			2
there are key players who will require extra time to recover from injuries than the clubs are comfortable with and others might need a couple of weeks away from playing to do the conditioning they need			0
who at the @entity198 has the clout to make that happen ? i am not convinced the partnership between the @entity198 and the clubs is as healthy as some want you to believe			0
are we going to suffer from not having central contracts ? this team must be fitter , faster and stronger to have any chance at the @entity7			2
@entity32 must ensure his @entity0 side get fitter , which he has time to do , in order to compete next year the bigger picture there seems to be a lot going on off the field - a lot of media work and commercial stuff			1
this all makes the @entity0 camp appear very friendly and nice but it has little to do with playing great rugby and is just a general distraction			2
the pressure the team came under in the last fortnight will have reminded everyone it is the rugby that matters			0
very few seem interested in the culture of the team when the performance has been as lacklustre as it has been this autumn			0
this is where the @entity0 players , led by @entity103 , need to stand up , take responsibility and just say a firm ‘ no ’			2
seeing the players being asked ‘ who in the team thinks he looks like @entity238 ? ’ makes me cringe			0
i get the feeling the players hate doing this but are not strong enough to say no. the team ’s interests must come first - not fulfilling commercial objectives or creating savvy social media content			0
@entity0 winning games is what everyone wants , so let ’s allow the team to get on with it and reduce all this background noise			2
@entity0 must look at bigger picture and not answer questions like ' who thinks he looks like @entity238 ? ' as captain , @entity103 must be strong and dictate terms , ensuring his side are not pressurised by social media get in knockout mode @entity0 should now approach the @entity262 as a five - game @entity7			1
their first two games should be seen as the two @entity264 against @entity266 and @entity3 , which they must win to come top of the pool and have a potentially easier route to the final			1
their final three games will approximate to the quarter - final , semi-final and final			0
let ’s get into that mindset now			0
@entity0 must get into knockout mode and treat the @entity262 as a five - game @entity7 , with the challenge offered by @entity266 and @entity279 ( left ) in the first match as a pool game before the latter stages beatable all blacks @entity47 are not streets ahead of the other main nations			1
in some matches this year they have looked vulnerable and the gap will continue to close			0
their pack can be dominated by @entity0 and @entity291			2
@entity47 have never won a @entity7 away from home			1
@entity47 's forward , pictured fighting against @entity266 , are able to be dominated by @entity296 sides @entity0 showed against the @entity47 that they are capable of beating them up front less wailing in wales do n’t pay too much attention to the occasional hysteria that takes over down in @entity266 ! @entity303 has won @entity304 , @entity262 @entity305 and led the @entity85 to a series win in @entity3			1
he is a great coach and now @entity266 have a southern - hemisphere scalp , they are in very decent order			1
if they beat @entity0 in the @entity262 watch @entity266 fly			1
@entity266 will be boosted by their victory over @entity291 - celebrated here by captain @entity312 head coach @entity303 is a fantastic coach and he will ensure @entity266 are ready for the @entity262 no @entity313 in less than 18 months , @entity314 under @entity315 have become @entity262 champions and autumn conquerors of @entity291 and @entity3			1
@entity315 has achieved all that despite a raft of injuries and the retirement of @entity322			0
@entity314 are @entity7 contenders and that turnaround is down to one man			1
@entity325 and @entity314 are going from strength to strength and will be a force come the @entity262 @entity315 has been the solitary reason behind why @entity314 have progressed so impressively the joy of six it is going to be one of the best @entity262 in memory			1
as well as @entity0 , @entity266 and @entity314 , the @entity334 have upped their game			1
@entity296 rugby is flexing its muscles and three or four of our teams will have outstanding @entity133			2
@entity344 's @entity343 scores against @entity3 - they are another @entity296 side on the up 16 - tackles made by a bloodied @entity347 against @entity3 - more than anyone else			1
@entity69 was also superb and made two try - saving efforts			0
@entity347 ( right ) was brilliant and was bloodied and led off the @entity79 pitch by physio @entity351 ( left )			2

@entity0 showed real bottle to beat @entity3 but need to look in mirror
lessons must be learned by @entity0 and the other home nations
@entity32 needs clear thinking in his selection *strategy*
@entity0 's front five can make @entity79 horrible place for visiting sides
@entity266 , @entity314 , @entity336 and @entity344 are flexing their muscles now
@entity0 must treat the @entity262 as a five - game @entity7
