by @entity0 published : 09:47 est , 18 may 2012 updated : 10:14 est , 18 may 2012 @entity2 cabinet minister @entity1 said race was a factor in the abuse of young white girls by @entity8 men @entity2 cabinet minister @entity1 today dramatically hit out at the ' small minority ' of @entity8 men who see white girls as ' fair game ' for sexual abuse			1
in comments following the @entity14 grooming scandal involving nine @entity2 men , the @entity17 co-chairman admitted that race was a factor			1
she urged @entity2 leaders to address the issue and ensure that men who regard white women as ' third class citizens ' are isolated by their communities			1
nine @entity2 men , mainly of @entity8 origin , were found guilty last week of plying girls as young as 13 with drink and drugs so they could ' pass them around ' and use them for sex			1
after the trial , @entity34 sought to play down suggestions of any racial element to the case , as did @entity39 , the @entity40 chairman of the home affairs select committee			1
but @entity1 , who grew up in a @entity8 community in @entity43 , told @entity46 ’s @entity45 newspaper : ' there is a small minority of @entity8 men who believe that white girls are fair game			1
' and we have to be prepared to say that			0
you can only start solving a problem if you acknowledge it first			0
' this small minority who see women as second class citizens , and white women probably as third class citizens , are to be spoken out against			1
' @entity1 , @entity60 ’s most senior @entity2 politician , said she had decided to speak out after her father - who moved to the @entity60 from the @entity62 - told her she should be ' out there condemning it as loudly as you could '			1
' in mosque after mosque , this should be raised as an issue so that anybody remotely involved should start to feel that the community is turning on them , ' she said			2
' communities have a responsibility to stand up and say , ‘ ' this is wrong , this will not be tolerated ' ’			2
' she also urged the authorities to have the confidence to tackle allegations involving minorities			0
' cultural sensitivity should never be a bar to applying the law , ' she said			1
the abuse began at two takeaways in the @entity87 area of @entity14 , including the @entity88 ( pictured ) , which is under new ownership under new ownership : the @entity91 takeaway - now renamed @entity92 's - was the other takeaway at the centre of the scandal the case sparked national outrage as the nine @entity99 men were jailed for a total of 77 years			1
the men - who are all from @entity8 , apart from one who is from @entity102 - were found guilty of raping and abusing up to 47 girls - some as young as 13 - after plying them with alcohol and luring them to takeaways			1
they were found to have groomed and ' shared ' the young white girls because they were vulnerable			2
despite overwhelming claims that the targeting of young white girls was a cultural problem , several senior figures were accused of ' burying their heads in the sand ' by denying the link			1
police played down the racial backgrounds of the men , saying the girls – mostly from broken or ‘ chaotic ’ homes – were targeted because they were vulnerable , not because they were white			2

this is about adults preying on vulnerable young children			0
it just happens that in this particular area and time the demographics were that these were @entity99 men			1
backing them , @entity39 , the @entity40 chairman of the home affairs select committee , told said that highlighting the @entity8 origin of all but one of the gang risked giving ammunition to the far - right			1
but @entity171 , former chief executive of children ’s charity @entity172 , said there was a ‘ real problem ’ which had to be confronted			0
‘ there is very troubling evidence that @entity178 are overwhelmingly represented in prosecutions for such offences , ’ he said			0
mr @entity171 added that ‘ vulnerable girls on the street at night are generally white rather than more strictly - parented @entity99 girls ’			2
this was even backed up by equalities chief sir @entity186 described as ‘ fatuous ’ the idea that there was no racial link in the @entity14 child sex grooming case			1
mr @entity186 , the chairman of the @entity191 , said it would be a ‘ national scandal ’ if it emerged that social services and schools had not acted on reports of abuse for fear of ‘ demonising ’ minority communities			2
he was asked on @entity202 ’s the @entity201 whether the case illustrated a cultural problem in part of the @entity8 @entity2 community about the way men regard white women as ‘ fair game ’			1
mr @entity186 replied : ‘ let ’s remember the most important thing about this is that these men are criminals ; these children are street kids			0
‘ however , i think anybody who says that the fact that most of the men are @entity99 and most of the children are white is not relevant , i mean that ’s just fatuous			1
