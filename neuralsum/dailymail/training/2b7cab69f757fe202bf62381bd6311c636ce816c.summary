@entity0 funding dissident @entity1 , say officials in @entity3 @entity5 officials confirmed today that @entity0 has been funding and training @entity7 dissidents to assassinate nuclear scientists involved in @entity7 's nuclear program			1
the claim has already been levelled by the @entity7 government who believed that @entity13 , @entity0 's secret service , have been arming dissidents with the terrorist organisation the @entity1 ( @entity1 )			1
last month @entity17 , 32 , a chemistry expert , was killed in a brazen daylight assassination when two assailants on a motorcycle attached a magnetic bomb to his car in @entity3			1
@entity33 , a senior aide to @entity7 's supreme leader @entity34 , told @entity32 : ' @entity0 does not have direct access to our society			1
@entity41 , being @entity7 and being part of @entity7 society , they have … places to get into the touch with people			2
' so i think they are working hand - to - hand very close			2
and we do have very concrete documents			2
' at one point , mr @entity33 claimed @entity13 had built a replica home of an @entity7 scientist so assassins could get to know the layout before they carried out an assassination			2
@entity1 denied involvement while the @entity0 @entity57 declined to comment			1
a spokesperson for @entity59 , of which @entity1 is the largest member , also denied the claim , saying : ' the claim that the @entity1 ( @entity1 / @entity1 ) had any role in the assassination of @entity7 nuclear scientists and the claim of the @entity1 / @entity1 cooperation with @entity13 is a total lie and there is not event a scintilla of truth in it			1
' the @entity59 has repeatedly denied the baseless allegation of playing a role in the assassination of nuclear scientists , whose primary source has been the propaganda organs of the clerical regime and the regime 's officials			2
' in an address yesterday , @entity0 president @entity83 referred to the @entity7 nuclear issue			1
assassinated : @entity17 's car is taken away for examination after he was killed he addressed the @entity7 people , saying : ' we were not born enemies and there is no need for us to live as enemies			2
do not allow the flags of hostility to cast a dark shadow on your heritage			0
' you are a sensitive people that aspire to friendship and peace , not conflict and wars			0
' however there have been suggestions that @entity0 's focus on @entity7 might really be a cover for destabilising president @entity108 's administration in @entity29			1
@entity109 : chemistry expert @entity17 was allegedly killed by @entity7 dissidents sponsored by @entity0 @entity0 prime minister @entity111 said publicly last month that he believed that an attack on @entity7 nuclear facilities might be welcomed by the people of the country			1
president @entity108 reiterated his view in an interview earlier this week that the increasing tension with @entity7 over the country 's nuclear program could be resolved peacefully through talks			0
however he did also say that a range of options were available			0
according to @entity126 , @entity111 's statements were to paint @entity108 as ' weak ' on @entity128 issues and undermine the president 's second run for the @entity131			0
@entity17 's death was the latest in a string of attacks on @entity7 scientists			0
mr @entity17 , who was a chemical engineer and reportedly worked on procurement for the uranium enrichment plant at @entity138 , was killed with his driver by a motorcycle assassin in rush - hour traffic			0
the killing of mr @entity17 in january bore a strong resemblance to earlier killings of scientists working on the @entity7 nuclear programme			0
his funeral in @entity3 several days later saw the ruling clergy stir the crowd of thousands of mourners who had gathered into a frenzy , urging the public to face down @entity155 and @entity0 threats against @entity7 's nuclear programme			1
they chanted ' death to @entity0 ' and ' @entity25 ' as the coffin was hoisted high and carried through the streets			1
several scientists have been killed or injured in the past two years and others have also been attacked or allegedly kidnapped - with @entity7 blaming the west			0
in june 2009 , @entity164 claimed to have been kidnapped while on a pilgrimage in @entity166 and transferred to the @entity5 where he said he was offered $ 50million to ' spread lies ' about @entity7 's nuclear work			0
he returned to @entity7 in july 2010			0
war of words : @entity0 prime minister @entity111 ( left ) has made veiled threats over @entity7 's nuclear program while @entity108 ( right ) has repeatedly said the issue can be resolved peacefully in january 2010 , nuclear scientist @entity174 was killed by remote - controlled bomb in @entity3 while in november , two car bomb blasts killed a nuclear scientist and wounded another in the capital			1
physicist @entity181 , 35 , was shot dead by gunmen in eastern @entity3 last july after being linked to the nuclear program			1
the @entity184 's @entity41 , also known as @entity1 , @entity1 and @entity1 , has been named a terror organisation both by the @entity5 and @entity7			1
it was accused of being responsible for the deaths of @entity5 servicemen and citizens in the 1970s and 80s			0
@entity0 , thought to hold the @entity128 's only atomic weapons , has warned @entity7 in the past against pursuing its nuclear research and development			1
explosion : a cloth covers a blood stain on the road as onlookers watch police on @entity7 's state - run @entity200 @entity7 has accused @entity0 ’s @entity13 , the @entity201 and @entity203 ’s spy agencies of engaging in an underground ' terrorism ' campaign against nuclear - related targets , including at least three killings since early 2010 and the release of a malicious computer virus that temporarily disrupted controls of some centrifuges - a key component in nuclear fuel production			2
all three countries have denied the @entity7 accusations			0
the @entity5 and its allies are pressuring @entity7 to halt uranium enrichment , a key element of the nuclear programme that the @entity220 suspects is aimed at producing atomic weapons			0
uranium enriched to low levels can be used as nuclear fuel but at higher levels , it can be used as material for a nuclear warhead			0
@entity7 denies it is trying to make nuclear weapons , saying its programme is for peaceful purposes only			0
claims : @entity33 , a senior aide to @entity7 's supreme leader @entity34 , blamed the assassination of an @entity7 scientist on a ' dirty plot ' by @entity0			2
