makeup is a precise mask used to subtly enhance features and hide blemishes			2
for kids , it is a whole other world of excitement			0
a group of mothers handed over the lipstick , blusher , mascara , foundation and nail varnish to their daughters aged three to six			2
and the results were spectacular			0
abstract : @entity16 sports one entirely pink hand and colored streaks painted by three - year - old @entity19 not so precise : @entity20 forwent her usual mascara for five - year - old @entity23 's unusual makeover striking : @entity25 's four - year - old daughter @entity24 opted for a few streaks of black and purple for her mother all 10 look more like abstract works of art , with dots of black on their chins and swathes of pink across their fingers			1
one mother has dark purple lips , a black line running from her cheek bone to her neck , and small black spots underneath her eyes			1
another sports one green - powdered eye , candy pink lipstick across her face from ear - to - ear , and multi-colored nail varnish			1
a third has faint smudges and drips of blue , yellow and silver on her cheeks and nose , frosty lips - and her left hand is covered in metallic pink nail varnish			1
subtle : @entity62 's faint smudges of blue and pink by @entity65 , four , is far from her usual touch ups @entity67 : @entity68 was given fiery red lips topped off with black spots on her cheeks by @entity72 , four rosy : @entity74 's five - year - old daughter @entity73 evidently feels her mother should highlight her nose the project is designed to encourage women - and men - to be more childlike in their approach to beauty			1
' this series was inspired through my attempts to see beauty the same way i used to as a child , ' photographer @entity85 told @entity89 about the project # @entity90			1
' i wanted to gain a better understanding through photography by trying to photograph what each girl saw when she saw her mother			0
minimalist : @entity98 's six - year - old , @entity97 , merely gave her mother a few simple dots of color design : @entity102 's arm was the star of the show for her daughter @entity105 , who also gave her white eyebrows barely anything : four - year - old @entity108 dipped her mother @entity75 's finger tips in metallic colors ' i would like all genders to learn the same thing i did from this project			2
' be more like children			0
stop trying so hard to meet the narrow - minded standards of others and allow beauty to have a more broad definition in your day - to - day life			0
' be more open to try and understand the different ways people choose to assert their identities			0
