a towering dust devil reaching half a mile in height has been pictured swirling across the surface of @entity4 by @entity5			1
the @entity7 ’s @entity6 captured the image with its @entity10 ( @entity10 ) camera on february 16 this year as it passed over the @entity12 region of the planet			1
despite the atmosphere on @entity4 being desperately thin – one per cent of @entity18 ’s pressure – the planet 's winds are strong enough to produce dramatic events and in the area observed , paths of many previous whirlwinds , or dust devils , are visible as streaks on the dusty surface			2
pluming hell : the towering dust devil snakes across the @entity4 surface air we go : despite a thin atmosphere , @entity4 still generates powerful winds the active dust devil displays a delicate arc produced by a westerly breeze partway up its height			2
the dust plume is about 30 metres ( 100ft ) in diameter			2
the image was taken during the time of @entity4 year when that planet is farthest from the sun. just as on @entity18 , winds on @entity4 are powered by solar heating			0
exposure to the sun 's rays declines during this season , yet even now , dust devils act relentlessly to clean the surface of freshly deposited dust , a little at a time			2
dust devils occur on @entity18 as well as on @entity4			0
they are spinning columns of air , made visible by the dust they pull off the ground			0
unlike a tornado , a dust devil typically forms on a clear day when the ground is heated by the sun , warming the air just above the ground			0
as heated air near the surface rises quickly through a small pocket of cooler air above it , the air may begin to rotate , if conditions are just right			0
the @entity6 has been examining @entity4 with six science instruments since 2006 and has has returned more data about @entity4 than all other orbital and surface missions combined			1
one of its cameras is so powerful they can reveal objects on @entity4 as small as an office desk			0
it has taken over 20,000 photographs of the @entity4 so far			0
the orbiter makes a complete circuit of @entity4 every 112 minutes , flying a nearly circular orbit that ranges in height from about 255 kilometres ( 160 miles ) over the @entity83 to 320 kilometres ( 200 miles ) over the @entity84			1
for handling large amounts of data , @entity6 has 160 gigabits of solid - state memory and a processor operating at up to 46 million instructions per second			1
snap happy : the @entity6 has taken over 21,000 pictures of the @entity4 since arriving there in 2006			1

picture was taken from over 160 miles up by @entity5 's @entity6
