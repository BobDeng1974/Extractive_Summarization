by @entity1 reporter a newly - released report has revealed that two of governor @entity5 's aides were romantically involved leading up to last year 's traffic closures			1
@entity7 , who infamously sent an email saying ' time for some traffic problems in @entity10 ' , was reportedly dating @entity5 's former campaign manager @entity11 throughout much of his re-election race			1
the report , released today by a law firm @entity5 hired to investigate the scandal , said that the two had been a couple for months but had called things off a month before the @entity20 lane closures			1
under examination : @entity7 , the @entity5 aide who sent the infamous ' time for some traffic problems in @entity10 ' email , was reportedly dating one of her colleagues for months before the scandal close : @entity11 ( left ) was @entity5 's campaign manager until april when he stepped down and @entity7 took over , and it appears that is when their romantic relationship took off @entity11 , 36 , worked as the @entity33 governor 's deputy chief of staff and then when he left the post in april to become @entity5 's campaign manager , he was replaced by @entity7 , 41			1
' at some point after @entity11 ’s departure to run the campaign , @entity7 and @entity11 became personally involved , although , by early august 2013 , their personal relationship had cooled , apparently at @entity11 ’s choice , and they largely stopped speaking , ' the report by @entity37 states			1
' because @entity11 was her " benefactor , " @entity7 relied heavily on him during this transition ' ahead of their august break up			1
the report also concluded that the governor was not involved in a plot to create gridlock near a major bridge as part of a political retribution scheme			0
the taxpayer - funded report released by @entity37 , a former federal prosecutor , relies on interviews with @entity5 and other officials in his administration and 250,000 documents , many of them emails and text messages			2
@entity5 's government funded lawyer claims the @entity66 governor had nothing to do with the @entity20 scandal ' we found that governor @entity5 had no knowledge beforehand of this @entity20 realignment idea , ' @entity37 said at a news conference			0
his report comes out ahead of any results from independent investigations by federal prosecutors and a special committee of state lawmakers			0
some of the key figures would not cooperate with @entity37 's investigation , leading @entity81 to question the credibility of the report and its thoroughness			0
@entity85 on investigation co-chair @entity86 released a statement effectively calling the report an attempt by @entity5 to move past the issue without critically examining the scandal			2
' lawyers hired by and paid by the @entity5 administration itself to investigate the governor ’s office who then say the governor and most of his office did nothing wrong will not be the final word on this matter , ' he said in a statement			2
during a media conference call thursday , @entity86 said that the mention of @entity7 and @entity11 's romantic entanglements was ' irrelevant ' especially because neither were interviewed for the report so there was no clear connection between their love life and the lane closures			1
' it is very difficult to tell who is telling the truth when you do n't hear from both sides , ' he said			0
' it reads more like a novel than a work of fact			0
' defending the report at a news conference thursday , @entity37 said , ' we believe we have gotten to the truth or we would n't be reporting it			0
' the september closure of lanes near the bridge that caused four days of massive gridlock in the community of @entity10 have become a major scandal for @entity5 , a possible 2016 @entity33 presidential contender			1
@entity5 said on a radio show wednesday that the events will not affect his decisions about his political future			0
in his view : governor @entity5 's office hired @entity37 , a former federal prosecutor , to investigate the scandal and the report released thursday declares clears @entity5 of wrongdoing the lawyer hired by @entity66 gov. @entity5 to review a traffic - blocking scandal that has engulfed @entity5 's administration released this report which a published report said clears the governor of any role in the plot the report , issued at @entity37 's @entity154 law office , concludes that former @entity155 and @entity66 official @entity156 and @entity157 aide @entity7 were behind the closures and that they were targeting @entity10 mayor @entity159			1
but it did not conclude why they wanted to hurt the @entity162 and said there was no evidence that it was because he refused to endorse @entity5 for re-election last year			2
@entity37 says that @entity7 , who did not cooperate with the report , tried to cover her tracks when @entity5 began asking what happened last year by asking a colleague to delete an email about the plot but the other staffer retained the email anyway , the report says			1
@entity37 also says that @entity156 suggested he mentioned traffic issues in @entity10 to @entity5 at public event during the lane realignment			1
@entity156 says @entity5 did not recall it being brought up and if it was , it would not have registered as significant to @entity5 — something @entity5 has said before			0
the report also finds that a claim by @entity185 mayor @entity184 , that @entity5 's administration told her that @entity187 would be tied to a private redevelopment plan , is ' demonstrably false '			0
a spokesman for @entity184 did not immediately return a call			0
@entity37 calls for @entity5 's office staffers to cease using personal email accounts for official business , eliminating the office where @entity7 had worked and appointing an ethics officer in the governor 's office			2
he also recommends major changes to the structure of @entity155 , an agency jointly run by the states of @entity154 and @entity66 .			0
