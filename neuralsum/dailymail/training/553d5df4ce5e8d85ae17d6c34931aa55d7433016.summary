outrage : @entity1 director general @entity0 , pictured , pledged to cap payout deals following public anger at the amount spent on redundancy packages the @entity1 has paid out more than £ 10million to staff in golden goodbyes over the last decade before giving them new jobs at the corporation			1
the cost of the ‘ revolving door ’ payroll emerged only days after the @entity1 was made exempt from a government crackdown on the practice			1
@entity17 bosses and council leaders were last week told they would be stripped of their ‘ unfair ’ redundancy packages if they were later rehired			0
but the @entity1 was not included in the legislation to ‘ protect its independence ’ , despite repeated criticism of the huge severance deals handed to departing members of staff			1
the revelation about the extent of spending on rehired staff will heap further pressure on bosses at the corporation to explain the use of licence fee money			2
figures from the corporation revealed that 286 full - time staff made redundant in the last 12 years and re-employed on permanent or fixed - term contracts received £ 10,230,905 in payouts			1
although the average payment was just under £ 36,000 , some senior figures have been re-employed despite receiving payoffs of up to £ 365,000 , the @entity1 last night defended the payouts , claiming it has strict rules in place preventing recently departed staff from being employed again			1
contracted staff are not allowed to be employed for a year after their initial employment has ended , while freelance staff must wait three months			0
however , the corporation ’s head of human resources or three directors can bypass these rules in ‘ exceptional circumstances ’			0
the @entity1 has not disclosed how many times such exceptional cases have been permitted			2
@entity59 director @entity58 accused the @entity1 of ‘ wasteful behaviour ’			2
he said : ‘ this lucrative revolving door must grind to a halt			0
this is a totally inappropriate use of the licence fee and is costing hard - pressed families a pretty penny			0
’ under new rules announced by the @entity71 last week , officials earning over £ 100,000 a year who take another job in the same public sector area within a year will have to pay back their redundancy package			0
but exceptions were made in the cases of the @entity1 , @entity75 and the @entity76			2
back in the building : almost 300 employees who were made redundant in the last 12 years were given redundancy payouts totalling more than £ 10million , but were later re-hired on permanent or fix - term contracts chief secretary to the treasury @entity81 said : ‘ in acknowledgement of its independence from @entity85 , the @entity1 is not subject to the clawback measures i announced last week			1
‘ however , i am writing separately to the @entity1 to explain the measures we have put in place			0
people will expect it to have in place measures at least as stringent as the ones i announced and that they will be implemented rigorously			0
’ criticism of the six - figure salaries routinely handed to senior @entity1 figures led to @entity0 capping severance payments at £ 150,000 last year			1
a @entity97 in 2013 found senior @entity1 managers received a total of £ 25million in severance deals between 2009 and 2012			2
embattled director general @entity101 was given a £ 470,000 severance deal after resigning in the wake of the @entity104 despite completing only 54 days of work			0
a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ our rules are stricter than the civil service and during a 12 - year period it is inevitable that a small number of staff will leave and re-join the @entity1			1

almost 300 employees made redundant since 2002 were later re-hired
the full - time staff were given payouts totalling more than £ 10million
@entity1 said it was ' inevitable ' that some staff would *rejoin* the corporation
