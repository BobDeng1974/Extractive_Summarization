giant ribbons of moist air flowing north from the tropics - each carrying 1,000 times more water than the @entity5 - are to blame for @entity7 's recent floods and wet summers , scientists believe			1
the ' atmospheric rivers ' , which bring the equivalent of the @entity12 's content in rain , are thought to have caused the worst 10 winter floods to have hit the @entity7 since 1970			1
now scientists believe they may also be linked to heavy rain in the summer , suggesting they pose an all - year threat to the country 's flood defences			1
why does it always rain on us ? this graphic shows how huge ' atmospheric rivers ' in the sky are causing floods in @entity7			1
water from warm @entity28 waters west of @entity29 and north @entity30 evaporates and the moist air is carried north by depressions			1
the air cools as it rises above @entity7 's mountainous west coast , producing heavy cloud and then downpours deluge : an aerial view of @entity37 , @entity38 , in the summer of 2007			2
scientists believe giant ribbons of moist air flowing from the @entity28 are causing flooding in @entity7 all year round submerged : scientists believe the 2007 flooding in @entity37 may have been caused by ribbons of moist air each carrying 1,000 times more water than the @entity5 measuring up to 300 miles wide and extending up to 2,000 miles from the tropics to northern @entity49 , they can bring torrential rainfall that lasts days			1
researchers say there are only four or five parts of the world where the ribbons form - and one of them is located above @entity7			0
the @entity7 is particularly vulnerable because of its mountainous west coast , which causes the moisture - laden air to rise and cool , creating rain clouds			0
a study by meterologists at @entity62 found that atmospheric rivers caused winter floods , including those which devastated @entity66 in november 2009 and @entity67 in november 2010			2
but the phenomenon has also been linked to the heavy downpours that hit @entity7 in june , and scientists believe the ribbons may be to blame for flooding which struck large parts of the country in the summer of 2007			1
recurring problem : @entity37 was hit by flooding again in may this year			0
scientists believe the heavy rainfall was caused by moist air flowing north from the tropics water , water everywhere : researchers have found that atmospheric rivers are to blame for the worst 10 floods to hit @entity7 since 1970 , including those which affected @entity86 in @entity66 in november 2009 inundated : the @entity87 burst its banks and flooded properties in @entity86 , @entity66 , in 2009 for years , the cause of @entity7 's wet summers has been identified as the jet stream , a fast - flowing band of air more than 30,000ft up which brings @entity28 depressions over the country when it moves south			1
while the jet stream is almost certainly a factor , scientists now believe the atmospheric rivers also contribute to the heavy rainfall			0
the @entity62 team looked into the subject at the request of the @entity102 , which has set aside Â£ 15million to pay for studies into @entity7 's changing weather patterns			0
led by atmospheric scientist @entity107 , the team 's work involved flying research aircraft into storms and using satellites to follow the movement of masses of moist air			2
dangerous : a car struggles to make its way through water in @entity117 , @entity67 , in november 2010 , one of the 10 worst winter floods to hit @entity7 since 1970 help : a girl gets a piggyback during floods in the village of @entity124 , near @entity125 , @entity67 , in 2010 the scientists found that much of the rain falling in @entity7 comes from water evaporated from the warm @entity28 waters west of @entity29 and north @entity30			1
between eight and 10 times a year , @entity28 depressions generate a narrow band of wind which carries the water to @entity7			0
having found the atmospheric rivers , which had been invisible to most scientific instruments , researchers are expected to look into how they could be affected by climate change			0
there are fears that rising temperatures will lead to more flooding as warm air can carry more moisture			0
downpours : a @entity124 resident 's home is protected by sandbags in november 2010 ( left ) and floodwater surrounds local shops ( right ) in the centre of @entity152 near @entity153 , @entity154 , in june 2012 the study 's abstract reads : ' damage from flooding in the winter and fall seasons has been widespread in the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) and @entity49 over recent decades			2
' here we show that winter flood events in the @entity7 are connected to @entity166 ( @entity167 ) , narrow ribbons along which a large flux of moisture is transported from the subtropics to the mid-latitudes			0
' combining river flow records with rainfall measurements , satellite data and model simulations , we demonstrate that @entity167 occur simultaneously with the 10 largest winter flood events since 1970 in a range of @entity7 river basins , suggesting that @entity167 are persistently critical in explaining extreme winter flooding in the @entity7			2
' understanding the physical processes that determine the persistence of ar events will be of importance in assessing the risk of future flooding over north - western @entity49 and other mid-latitude regions			0
' no entry : floodwater swells the @entity187 as it flows through @entity188 in september this year , almost covering road signs giant : the strongest ribbons of moist air carry more water than the @entity12 , the world 's longest river , scientists believe			1

giant ribbons of moist air flowing north from the tropics bring heavy rain
some ' rivers ' carry as much water as the @entity12
ribbons blamed for worst 10 winter floods to hit @entity7 since 1970
researchers say they are also linked to the country 's recent wet summers
