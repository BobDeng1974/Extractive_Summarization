by @entity0 members of the @entity3 athletics team have launched a protest against strict corporate sponsorship rules which prevent competitors promoting non-official brands during the @entity8			1
dozens of track and field athletes have taken to @entity11 , @entity12 and personal blogs to demand reform of ‘ @entity15 ’ which forbids them to advertise their own personal sponsors if they are not approved @entity8 partners			1
the 100m hurdler @entity19 even posted a photograph on @entity11 of her mouth gagged with duct tape with ‘ @entity15 ’ written on it			1
the @entity3 hurdler @entity19 posted this picture on @entity11 in protest at restrictions against sponsorship at the @entity28 the @entity29 issued guidelines to all athletes prior to the @entity32 saying they could be sanctioned if they openly promote other brands			1
the @entity29 wanted to protect the exclusivity of companies such as @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , who have paid more than £ 609m towards the @entity8 , and say there would be no @entity28 without big - money sponsors			1
but the athletes argue that they are missing out on the biggest opportunity to promote their own sponsors , who often pay for their equipment , training facilities and travel to competition			0
at the forefront of the protest is 400m runner @entity51 , who pointed out that while @entity8 stars can command million - dollar sponsorship deals , many other amateur members of the squad do n’t receive any funding and have to combine training with study or part - time jobs			1
@entity51 , a gold medal winner in the @entity61 and @entity62 , is married to @entity64 american football star @entity63 , who plays for the @entity65 on a three - year $ 15.3m ( £ 9.75m ) contract			0
but she spoke out for her teammates yesterday , saying : ‘ people see the @entity8 , when athletes are at their best but they do n’t see the three or four years before when many of my peers are struggling to stay in the sport			2
the @entity3 sprinter @entity51 is leading the protest about @entity8 sponsorship			1
she is married to @entity64 star @entity63 , who plays on a $ 15.3m ( £ 9.75m ) deal with the @entity65 @entity51 spoke out on behalf of her teammates at a press conference yesterday just days before the start of the athletics events at @entity28 @entity51 , as well as the @entity3 athletics team , are sponsored by @entity81			2
the official partner of the @entity83 is rival @entity36 ‘ the majority of track and field athletes do n’t have sponsors			1
in the sport , a lot of my peers have second and third jobs to be able to do this			0
‘ we understand that the @entity29 is protecting its sponsors but we want to have a voice as well			1
’ she claimed that only two per cent of @entity3 athletes would be able to tweet about their sponsors because they are in line with official @entity8 brands			1
@entity51 was also leading the protest on @entity11 , where the hashtags # @entity102 and # @entity104 were trending yesterday			1
she was supported by other members of the @entity106 , including long distance runner @entity107 , javelin thrower @entity108 , sprinter @entity109 and many others			0
@entity51 has been leading the protests on @entity11 a tweet by sprinter @entity109 asking why athletes are unable to advertise personal sponsors a @entity12 post by runner @entity116 in protest at requests to remove pictures of his running shoes @entity19 later tweeted the duct tape gag picture alongside the message : ‘ @entity129 world … can anyone guess what ’ll be in my dreams ? # @entity104 ’ rule 40 of the @entity131 states : ‘ except as permitted by the @entity132 , no competitor , coach , trainer or official who participates in the @entity8 may allow his person , name , picture or sports performances to be used for advertising purposes during the @entity8			1
’ the rule was reinforced by a 20 - page briefing note sent to all athletes and agents by @entity8 organisers @entity146			2
it explains : ‘ ambush marketers have , in the past , used their association with athletes to suggest or imply that they have an association with the @entity8			2
this undermines the exclusivity that @entity154 can offer official games and @entity157 sponsors , without whose investment the @entity8 could not happen			2
’ the distance runner @entity107 was among the many @entity3 athletes who pledged their support to the protest the @entity29 said today that they would be summoning officials from the @entity106 and asking them to ‘ reach out ’ to their athletes to quell the protests			1
in response , the @entity106 spokesman @entity168 said the athletes should appreciate the investment of official sponsors			0
he said : ‘ while the athletes are the heart of the @entity8 , and the movement more broadly , without the support of our official partners , the @entity8 would not be able to happen			2
‘ our partners provide 40 percent of our budget			0
if the value of those sponsorships declines because we can no longer provide exclusivity , then our level of support for athletes overall will decline			0
the result of loses by these standards will be less money to athletes , not more			0
’ this will come as little consolation to some @entity3 athletes , who now look likely to lose money on the @entity28			0
the middle - distance runner @entity116 said he was ‘ disappointed ’ after being made to take down pictures of his shoes and comments about their performance from his @entity12 page			0
‘ this rule is very distracting to us athletes , and it takes away from our @entity8 experience and training , ' he said			2
20km walk athlete @entity205 wrote an opinionated blog entry in which she talked about the difficulties of making ends meet while training for the @entity28			0
she wrote : ‘ i have no big brand coropoarate sponosor [ sic ] who gives me free gear , pays me a salary , and gives me a bonus for making it to events like the @entity28 or rewards my spotlight in the media with another bonus check			0
‘ no my sponsors are my family , my friends , my high school community , the family of race walkers around the country			0
my sponsor bonus comes from each and every dollar thrown in my bucket and every donation on my website			0
’ the rebel athletes have gained the support of @entity235 , @entity8 hurdles champion in 1976 and 1984 , who said track and field was trailing professional sports in terms of earning potential			1
rule 40 from the olympic charter : ' except as permitted by the @entity132 , no competitor , coach , trainer or official who participates in the @entity8 may allow his person , name , picture or sports performances to be used for advertising purposes during the @entity8			1
' the briefing note sent out to athletes by @entity146 : ‘ ambush marketers have , in the past , used their association with athletes to suggest or imply that they have an association with the @entity8			0
this undermines the exclusivity that @entity154 can offer official games and @entity157 sponsors , without whose investment the @entity8 could not happen			2
‘ the implication of an association with the @entity8 through use of athletes is particularly powerful during and immediately before the @entity8			0
’ it adds : ‘ participants who do not comply with @entity15 may be sanctioned by the @entity29 and / or by the @entity269 in accordance with the @entity277 ’ agreement which provides for wide ranging sanctions , including amongst other things removal of accreditation and financial penalties			1
