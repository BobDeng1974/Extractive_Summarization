it could prove embarrassing for chancellor @entity10 @entity4 ’s gold - plated triple @entity2 status came under pressure today after an influential credit ratings agency put it on negative watch			1
@entity14 ’s ( @entity14 ) said there was a one in three chance it could lower @entity4 ’s rating within the next two years , if economic conditions weaken in the @entity4			1
it said it expected government debt as a percentage of gross domestic product ( gdp ) to continue to rise in 2015 , before declining again , with future employment or growth shocks putting further pressure on @entity29 finances			1
the agency said : ' in our opinion , many of the factors that have restrained growth in recent years will likely continue to do so in the near term			0
' @entity14 was the last of the three major credit rating agencies to maintain a stable outlook for @entity4 , and the move comes just over a week after chancellor @entity10 said he would no longer be able to cut @entity4 's net debt by 2015			1
a downgrade by one of the big three credit ratings agencies would drive up the @entity4 's borrowing costs , potentially jeopardising the government 's deficit reduction plans			1
' the outlook revision reflects our view that we could lower the ratings on the @entity4 within the next two years if fiscal performance weakens beyond our current expectations , @entity14 said in a statement			2
' we believe this could occur in particular as a result of a delayed and uneven economic recovery , or a weakening of political commitment to consolidation , ' it added			0
@entity4 's finance ministry stressed that @entity14 backed the country 's current deficit - reduction plan			2
' @entity14 's endorse the government 's ' strong commitment to implementing the fiscal mandate ' and specifically warn against slowing ' the pace and extent of fiscal consolidation '			0
it is because we have stuck to that commitment that the deficit is down , ' a spokesman said			0

the @entity79 is pictured the government 's bond trading had largely finished for the day when @entity14 made its announcement			0
@entity83 , @entity4 economist at @entity84 , said that @entity4 was at risk of a downgrade from one of the major ratings agencies if the economy does not perform better than the government currently forecasts			2
' the @entity4 has n't been downgraded yet , but it is getting closer , ' he said			0
' the @entity4 needs to stop disappointing on growth and the public finances			0
however , the @entity4 has suffered persistent slippage since mid- 2010 so the odds are skewed towards a downgrade			0
' a @entity97 spokesman said the move brought @entity14 in line with rival agencies @entity101 and @entity102 's , which both revised the @entity4 to a negative outlook earlier this year			2
the @entity14 report comes after chancellor @entity10 said he will not be able to start bringing down national debt as a percentage of gross domestic product ( gdp ) in 2015/16 , in his @entity109			1
he said he must extend his fiscal consolidation period by a year to 2017/18 after the independent tax and spending watchdog , the @entity110 ( @entity110 ) , said it expected gdp to fall this year by 0.1 % , compared to previous estimates of 0.8 % growth .			0
