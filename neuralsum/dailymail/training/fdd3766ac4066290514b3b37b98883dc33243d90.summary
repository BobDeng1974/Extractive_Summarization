leaping from high cliffs into dangerous , crocodile - infested waters - these are the moments a herd of gnus put their lives at risk as they migrate in search of food			2
many of the animals , also known as wildebeest , do not make it out alive as they take the treacherous leap of faith down the sheer ridge the stunning shots were taken in the @entity17 in @entity18 by @entity20 photography duo @entity19 and @entity21			1
leap of faith : the gnus jump from the high , sheer cliff face into crocodile - infested waters as they migrate in search of food and drinking water treacherous times : one gnu plunges head - first into the muddy river ( left ) while another slips and gets stuck down a crack in the cliff ( right ) all creatures great and small : a herd of zebras joins the gnus , also known as wildebeest , as they make a slightly easier crossing through a river sure - footed : the gnus have to be extremely careful as they descend the steep cliff face that they do not land badly and kill or injure themselves i believe i can fly : a brave gnu soars from the edge of the rocks and into the water below , before trying to swim across to safety pack mentality : the gnus travel in herds , as this makes it easier from them to overcome obstacles together and to protect the young and weak ' the gnus need to make the dangerous trip down the cliff and across the river , so they do n't run out of food when the winter months come , ' mr @entity19 said			1
' the gnus throw themselves off the ridge and some get stuck into the ridges of the cliffs , which is jaw - dropping to watch			0
' the animals ' migration starts at the end of the @entity76 rainy season , as they go off in search of drinking water and food , and they come back months later when the rain also returns			1
stunning : the incredible photographs were captured by @entity20 duo @entity19 and @entity21 in the @entity17 in @entity18 what goes down must come up : the herd of gnus make their way up the bank after crossing the river ( left ) while one makes a huge leap down the cliff ( right ) making a splash : one of the migrating beats has a very sloppy landing as it slips from the cliff face and falls backwards into the river far more graceful : another gnu looks far more comfortable as it leaps elegantly into the waters below to join its companions you 're next : a group of gnus , including some young , stand at the edge of the cliff and wait their turns to undertake the terrifying ordeal to tackle the obstacles that are presented to them , they travel in large herds , learning from and protecting each other			1
they protect the smaller , weaker members of the group from predators by keeping them in the middle of the herd , and having the strongest animals on the outsides			0
mr @entity19 and ms @entity120 have been taking pictures together for over 20 years and they come to the @entity18 reserve every year to try and capture the incredible shots			2
ms @entity120 said : ' we know when the gnus are going to migrate so we set our cameras up and just wait to see what happens			0
' it is always so exciting and an incredible experience			0
i ca n't wait to go back and watch it next year			0
