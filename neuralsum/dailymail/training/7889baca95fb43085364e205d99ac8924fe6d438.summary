@entity1 the parrot has got herself in a flap - because she thinks she is a chicken			1
the confused parrot started impersonating the farmyard animal after hearing the noise on a children 's cartoon shown on tv			1
but the two - year - old @entity11 grey soon became so obsessed with clucking that she ditched her cawing entirely			1
now @entity1 spends all day long pretending to be a chicken - much to the delight of her owners			1
she 's a chicken now from morning until night			1
' i think she 's hilarious			2
my family think the same			0
they just laugh at her			0
' the strange noises began after ms @entity22 left on the tv o keep @entity1 amused while she was out			1
hours later , she came home to find the bird clucking away			2
she said : ' i just came down the other day and she was going on like a chicken , i was like " @entity36 where did that come from ? " ' then i realised it came from the telly			1
if i go out during the day , i either put the radio or the tv on so there is always some background noise			2
' i put on @entity45 and it 's obviously came from that			2
i do n't know what programme it was but i know it came from @entity45			0

ms @entity22 , who has owned @entity1 since she was a chick , said : ' her first couple of outbursts in the morning are loud			1
she likes to let you know she 's awake			1
' she also whistles away to the @entity53 song			1
she really keeps us amused			0
she can also whine like our @entity64 and i 'm sure the bark will come			2
' the dog is five months and its quite fun to watch the two of them together			0
' i actually came down the other day and wondered whether it was the dog or her whining , and it was her			2
' she makes various noises			0
she 'll say " i love you " and " @entity80 " and she sings songs here and there			0
she 's quite a tame parrot			0
