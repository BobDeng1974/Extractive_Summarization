by @entity0 published : 19:15 est , 18 december 2012 updated : 05:01 est , 19 december 2012 if your attempts at dancing are confined to an awkward stumble at the office @entity6 , it might be time to take some advice from the experts			1
and who better than @entity11 judges @entity12 and @entity14 ? to help correct flailing limbs and cheesy disco moves , the pair have compiled a list of ten top tips for ungainly novices			1
a former principal dancer at the @entity22 , miss @entity14 told the @entity23 : ‘ when i ’m not on stage i make a fool of myself on the dance floor quite happily			1
’ but in the spirit of @entity28 , she and @entity12 are happy to pass on the results of their considerable experience … do ... find the perfect dance partner @entity14 says : ' copy shamelessly			1
find someone who is looking good and dance next to them , then you can copy their moves and see that what you are doing works with the music			1
do n't ... be a pest if the dance floor is crowded , do n't flail about playing the air guitar			2
do ... throw caution to the wind @entity14 says : ' when i 'm not on stage i make a fool of myself on the dance floor quite happily			2
it 's very liberating not to worry about perfecting every step and technique			2
do n't ... raise your arms never bring your arms above your head - keep them below shoulder height at all times			2
you 're dancing , not drowning			0
do ... try dancing to everything @entity14 says : ' i love latin music - the @entity62 always have me on my feet - but i 'll try it all ! listen for the back beat and start clapping your hands and moving your feet			0
do ... have a drink if you 're nervous , have a couple to fortify yourself ! it can sometimes work against you , but as long as you enjoy yourself it does n't matter			0
do n't ... do the twist in a very short skirt and if you 're in a strapless top do n't lift your arms up too far			1
do hide behind others : never be the first on the dance floor … ever ! wait until there are a few people out there who know what they ’re doing			0
do n't sit on the dance floor : pretending to row a boat , for example , especially when you ’re drunk and ca n’t get back up again , is never acceptable			0
do keep yourself to yourself : step to the side and tap and then step to the other side and tap - that works to any song and always looks good			0
