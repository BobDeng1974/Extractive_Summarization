by @entity0 published : 18:51 est , 14 april 2013 updated : 18:53 est , 14 april 2013 control : @entity2 mp says the @entity3 wishes to punish media that is critical of its corruption @entity7 is pumping millions of pounds of public money into groups dedicated to stifling a free press , it emerged yesterday			1
the @entity11 is helping to fund groups seeking state - backed regulation of newspapers , including key allies of @entity17 ’s hacked off campaign			2
one – called @entity18 – has a mission statement to ‘ reclaim a free and independent media ’ and is demanding tougher sanctions than ‘ an apology or correction ’			0
the @entity3 has spent £ 2.3million on the previously unpublicised project			1
the commission says it wants to be a ‘ moral compass ’ against press misconduct and is seeking new national and @entity29 - wide regulatory powers against newspapers			0
but critics say it is only taking such a stance because of the unfavourable coverage that @entity29 institutions get in the @entity36			0
@entity2 , a @entity37 member of the @entity38 , said : ‘ given the scandals in the @entity3 and revelations of its misappropriation of funding , it is no surprise that @entity29 wants to restrict the free press which can uncover its corruption			1
‘ and it shows up exactly the sort of body that hacked @entity50 is if it wants to ally itself with these sorts of people			1
’ a policy brief for @entity18 , co-authored by its lead @entity55 researcher , @entity54 , says it is ‘ simplistic ’ to see state influence over the @entity36 as ‘ inherently stifling ’			0
@entity18 recently produced ‘ recommendations for the @entity55 ’ demanding the ‘ imposition of sanctions beyond an apology or correction ’ on errant media outlets and the ‘ co-ordination of the journalistic profession at the @entity29 level ’			0
dr @entity54 , from @entity66 , also called for further chilling action against the @entity36 to ensure ‘ that neither the media , nor those individuals who own or work for the media , enjoy an absolute right to freedom of expression ’			0

dr @entity54 told the @entity86 that the @entity3 funding may have been prompted by @entity7 ’ belief that the @entity36 treats it unfairly			1
as well as @entity18 , there are at least five other initiatives backed by @entity7 to increase its powers over the media			2
one , @entity93 , has channelled about £ 100,000 of @entity29 cash directly to a key hacked off ally , the @entity98 campaign group			0
@entity99 , executive director of the @entity100 , said last night : ‘ it is ‘ strange if the @entity3 is investing in ways to set up bureaucratic interference with the @entity36 ’ .			2

@entity7 flows money to organisations *opposing* press freedom
one organisation is a key *partner* of @entity50
