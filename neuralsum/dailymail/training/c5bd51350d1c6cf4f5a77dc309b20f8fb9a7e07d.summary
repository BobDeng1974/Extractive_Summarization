women in their thirties are earning more than men for the first time on record , new figures show			1
in recent years , full - time female workers have earned higher hourly wages than men in their 20s , but then suffer poorer pay in their 30s			1
this gap then widens in their 40s , 50s and 60s			0
but now , statistics show women are staving off the gender pay gap for longer by having a family later in life			1
new figures show that female workers are now earning 0.2 per cent more than men aged 30 to 39 ( file picture ) according to the @entity24 , men earn more in their teenage years but then women are paid one per cent more between 22 and 29			1
new figures show that female workers are also now earning 0.2 per cent more than men aged 30 to 39 , after creeping marginally ahead			1
but when they hit their 40s , women fall 14 per cent behind their male colleagues for hourly wages , a trend which continues until they retire			2
the average age of mothers in @entity35 and @entity36 is now 30.1 compared to 29.8 two years ago meaning more women are having children well into their thirties			1
@entity40 , at the @entity41 , said : ‘ the fact that women are now earning more in their thirties may well be because they are having children later			2
‘ a great proportion of the gender gap has been about the ‘ motherhood gap ’ , where women leave the labour market to have children and return perhaps in a different capacity or reduced wage			0
’ he said he expected the gender pay gap between men and women in their 40s and 50s should also narrow as a new generation of females who are ‘ achieving their potential early in their professional careers ’ reach middle age			2
the gender pay gap has narrowed over the last year and is now 9.4 per cent compared to 10 per cent in 2013			0
minister for women and equalities @entity66 ( pictured ) said : ‘ i am delighted that the gender pay gap has reduced to its lowest point in history ' this is the lowest since records began but women continue to earn about £ 100 less than men every week			1
full - time women earn a median salary of £ 23,900 while men earn £ 29,400 , the @entity24 said			2
academics said the fact that women in their thirties had overtaken men was also indicative of a new generation of empowered , highly educated women who were fighting the gender pay gap			2
women in their twenties and thirties are more likely to have attended university and embarked on professional careers than their mothers and grandmothers			0
minister for women and equalities @entity66 said : ‘ i am delighted that the gender pay gap has reduced to its lowest point in history			1
@entity96 workers are suffering the worst pay rises on record after wages crept up by just £ 1 a week in the year to april , the @entity24 said			0
average weekly earnings for full time staff grew from £ 517 to £ 518 following a 0.1 per cent pay rise			0
this is the smallest growth in wages since records began 17 years ago			1
adjusted for inflation , weekly earnings fell by 1.6 per cent in the year , continuing the downward trend which began seven years ago			1
public sector pay increased four times as fast as private sector pay			0
‘ however , there is more to be done and the government will continue to work with industry to make sure it reduces even further			0
’ @entity115 , of the @entity116 , said : ‘ it is great news that women in their 30s are now earning a little more than men across all roles			1
‘ however , women in senior management roles and those over 40 are still facing significant pay gaps			0
‘ the delay in this gap emerging can in part be attributed to the effect of women putting their careers first and delaying motherhood until they reach their 30s			2
‘ but it also shows that employers still have much more to do ensure that those valued women in their mid-careers are not missing out when they start a family , and have opportunities to continue to contribute through well - paid , quality professional roles			2
‘ otherwise , they ’ll find many of their most talented employees vote with their feet and leave			0
’ the @entity24 said : ‘ the gap is negative for the 22 - 29 and 30 - 39 age groups , meaning that women earn on average more than men			1
‘ thereafter , there is a relatively large positive gap			0
‘ this is likely to be connected with the fact that many women have children and take time out of the labour market			0
’ @entity156 said it was the first time on record that full - time women in their thirties earned higher hourly wages than men .			0
