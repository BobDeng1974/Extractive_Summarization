@entity0 has never been more prevalent			0
easily accessed online , the adult entertainment industry has been blamed for everything from unrealistic expectations in bed to the depraved behaviour of killers such as @entity7			2
now porn is in the firing line of sexual health specialist and tv personality dr @entity12 , who in his latest book , @entity13 , claims watching too much is making sex lives suffer			1
in this exclusive extract , he reveals why porn is the sexual equivalent of fast food and explains what to do if your partner likes it a little bit too much			1
unrealistic : according to dr @entity12 , too much porn can lead to skewed expectations during real world sex expert : @entity31 regular dr @entity12 specialises in sexual health and male infertility ' watching porn and masturbating is the sexual equivalent of fast food			1
it ’s instant gratification , and it ’s fine once in a while when you ’re craving some @entity42 fries or nachos smothered in that fake orange cheese goop , but for nourishment ? forget about it			0
like many other things that are bad for us yet can sure taste good in the moment , pornography can start out as a harmless , once - in - a - while indulgence			0
but for a lot of men , it can be surprisingly easy to get sucked into the vortex of a true addiction to porn that will be hazardous to his health , both physically and emotionally , without even knowing it			1
that ’s why porn addiction is the number one issue that sex therapists deal with			1
countless experts have discussed the shocking amount of porn consumed in this country but here ’s the thing i have yet to hear any of them talk about : for the overwhelming majority of men who watch a lot of porn , it creates unique sexual performance problems			1
yes , the very thing that is supposed to stimulate and arouse men ( or women ) sexually can actually destroy their overall libido and performance			0
so why is n’t anyone talking about the effect on @entity87 -- the @entity88 — aspect of porn ? they ’re discussing why a guy watches it -- and not what happens to his penis when he watches			2
i can tell how much porn a man is watching as soon as he starts talking candidly to me about any sexual dysfunction he has			1
when a man chronically watches porn and gets off on it , or watches porn with his hands on himself so he can masturbate at the same time ( which is what usually happens ) , the sensory stimulation he gets from the virtual world makes it much more difficult for him to get aroused , stay aroused , and be happily aroused by the real , live woman in his life			1
not good : too much porn can also have a negative effect on male arousal according to dr @entity12 every addict is different but there are certain behaviours that would suggest porn addiction			1
if you answer yes to any of these , it might be time for a heart - to - heart			2
is he asking for rougher sex or more unusual positions ? is he suffering from any ejaculation problems ? is he being more critical about your body , particularly your breast size ? is he asking you to make any changes to your body , such as getting a @entity135 wax , that you are uncomfortable with ? does he have particular favourites that he likes to watch repeatedly ? does he get angry if you do n’t want to watch with him ? does he withhold sex if you tell him you do n’t want to watch ? does he want to act out different scenarios he might have seen , even if you make it clear you do n’t want to ? does he have secret or password - protected sites online ? has he ever watched porn in an inappropriate public place ( such as on an aeroplane ) ? does he have another mobile phone account or credit card ? will he cancel social engagements because he ’d rather watch porn ? are his friends dropping hints to you about the porn he watches ? is he evasive or defensive when you ask him about porn ? does he choose porn instead of wanting to have sex with you ? in other words , his frequent porn - fuelled masturbation leads to sexual dysfunction with a partner			1
if he can only have an orgasm when watching porn , and if he becomes accustomed to having orgasms only in a certain way or while watching a certain thing , he ’s in trouble and so are you			2
there ’s also a flip side : some porn addicts they want sex on their terms , in order to fulfill whatever fantasies have been “ inspired ” by what they ’ve been watching			1
the porn and his masturbating are having the opposite effect on his performance when having sex — it ’s called retarded ejaculation			1
his lasting ' too long ' is the opposite of what most men experience when they watch a lot of porn — they ca n’t last at all			2
while it sounds like it might be a good thing , lasting too long can be just as troublesome for a relationship as when he ’s finished too quickly : feeling sore , bored , or fed up , wondering when he ’s going to get the job done			0
not to mention that the constant friction can actually be painful after a while			0
what ’s disheartening for me is that so many of the people i talk to have yet to realise that there ’s such a downside to watching pornography			0
unfulfilling : spending too much time with the computer can lead to a dull sex life on both sides of the couple not at first			1
i ’m the first person to tell you that a little porn can be a lot of fun — and that a man who likes to watch once in a while is not necessarily verging on porn addiction			1
but people can easily develop an addiction to it without even realising because it ’s such an easy habit to indulge in			2
a man can tell himself he ’s not really harming anyone or ' cheating '			0
he may have starting watching as a way to spice up his sex life or because it was fun — but viewing habits can quickly escalate , in part because it ’s so easy to stream porn 24/7			1
he can always find something to watch when he ’s in the mood , no matter where he is or what time it is , @entity236 does anyone get over a porn addiction ? it ’s not easy but it is doable			1
have your partner try these steps first : improvement : according to dr @entity12 , porn addiction can be overcome and sex lives put back on track out now : the @entity248 naked : the @entity249 for grown - ups is available from @entity251 take an immediate break — from all sex and masturbation , not just porn			1
when a man does n’t ejaculate for several days , he will be a lot more sensitive ( and a lot hornier ! ) , and he ’ll be more likely to climax within a normal period of time			2
try to schedule something absorbing during the time he usually spends watching porn			1
if you can take a short trip , great ( just do n’t turn on the tv , as there is usually porn available in hotel rooms if that ’s where you ’re staying )			1
or have him do additional chores around the house ( like the long - overdue garage cleaning , painting , or gardening , for example — something that is physical and makes it impossible to do while any electronic devices are around )			0
try to make your foreplay into more play			0
ask him what he likes to do when he ’s watching porn , and replace his hands with yours			2
when you touch him where he likes to touch himself , he ’ll relearn how to get that same sensation when he ’s alone with you			0
do this together — no cheating for him and going back to porn ! — and i promise that you wo n’t need thirty minutes for an orgasm any more			2
it ’s important you both talk about how much you love each other , and how much you cherish the emotional aspects of your sexual relationship so you can refocus on the qualities of your partner that you first were attracted to			2
act the way you did when you were first courting — i ’ll bet porn was not part of the equation then			0
this way , your desire will build naturally so that you both can enjoy the pleasure of real sex , and leave the virtual sex to the robots			0
if this does n’t work because your partner is truly addicted and / or unwilling to discuss the matter with you , you should consult professional help			0
look for a sex therapist experienced with porn addiction and sexual dysfunction			1
be prepared for the addict to have a hard time			0
if addictions were easy to kick , there would n’t be any addicts			0
just as smokers need to find something to do with their hands when they quit — drinking coffee , chewing gum , or eating ( which is why ex-smokers often gain weight ) , so do you need to find a better substitute			0
luckily , you already have one lying next to you every night			0
the @entity248 naked : the @entity249 for @entity328 , £ 9.05 ( @entity329 ) is out now and available from @entity251			0
