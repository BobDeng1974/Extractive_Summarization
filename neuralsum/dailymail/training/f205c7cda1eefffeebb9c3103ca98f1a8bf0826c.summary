by @entity0 published : 15:09 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 15:09 est , 8 april 2013 a new photography trend sees newlyweds plunge into the water and pose in their wedding outfits			2
@entity5 of @entity6 , who is based in @entity8 's @entity7 , has worked with hundreds of couples who choose to celebrate the first day of married life in this unique way			1
they ask to be photographed fully - submerged at exotic spots along the coast , and often by the end of the shoot they appear undressed as they let their soaked clothing slip off			2
bizarre trend : newlyweds are choosing to pose underwater in their wedding outfits to celebrate entering married life - here a couple hold a pose in the waters of @entity8 's @entity7 mr @entity25 , who runs his business with his wife @entity28 , told the @entity29 that they occasionally run into danger on location and he always has a large team of people on hand to help			1
' we mostly work in the safe places where you can stand , but we have a rescue swimmer at every shoot , ' he explained			2
' a lot of times we ’re having to throw our cameras down and save the bride because her crinoline ’s wrapped around her legs			1
' he said the craze for underwater wedding photography was born out of the @entity50 phenomenon , which sees brides effectively destroying a bridal gown by getting it wet or dirty			1
time and patience : photographer @entity5 said the images take hours of hard work as couples battle currents and cold water temperatures @entity60 : many of the couples end up undressed by the end of the shoot as they let their clothing slip off most couples request to be photographed while navigating underground caves and rivers in @entity7 , which is a popular scuba diving and snorkeling destination			1
although mr @entity25 's images have an effortless feel , it takes hours of hard work to capture each one , as strong currents and cold water temperatures present a challenge			2
describing some of the difficulties he faces , mr @entity25 said : ' none of our brides or grooms are models , and that ’s the most challenging issue			0
' none of them know how to hold their bodies or move their arms or face			0
hidden dangers : some brides have to be rescued from shoots because they get tangled up in their dress letting go : the trend for underwater wedding photography was born out of the @entity50 phenomenon , which sees brides effectively destroying a bridal gown by getting it wet or dirty final touch up : a bride applies make - up in a mirror underwater ' we ’re constantly directing these people : " ok , open your eyes ” and “ do n’t do that ” and “ ok , you ’re covering your arm ” and “ oops , wardrobe malfunction , pull up the dress			1
" ' [ that ’s ] coupled with water temperatures that are 62 , 65 degrees - it ’s cold			0
' so it ’s challenging to get what we want without , i do n’t want to say killing them , but we are pushing them to their limits			0
' and there is a current in these underground rivers , so these brides are fighting against the current			0
' caught on camera : mr @entity5 says many of the couples are open about their sensuality @entity60 : one couple choose to end their photo shoot completely naked despite the tough conditions mr @entity5 says that most people seize the opportunity to express their sexuality			1
some even request to conduct the whole photo session nude , while others get ' hot and steamy '			0
' it ’s a form of expression to be able to show nudity and combine it with love and art. i ’ve had clients order huge wall prints , and we ’ve had clients that are happy to share it on @entity148 , ' he added			0
while working with clients he said it is important to build rapport and have fun			0
often , he likes to dole out shots of tequila once a day 's work is over			2
@entity6 charges between $ 2,750 to $ 4,000 per photo shoot			0
mr @entity5 said some brides are hesitant to use their original wedding dresses and choose to wear a second - hand gown instead .			1

photographer @entity5 , who is based in @entity8 's @entity7 , says often the team have to stop to save the bride from drowning in her dress
