by @entity0 published : 08:20 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 14:08 est , 18 april 2013 @entity2 @entity1 has sparked another racism controversy after running a fashion shoot that included shots of white model , @entity7 , 27 , made - up to look black			1
the blonde model was also given an @entity10 wig in an attempt to make the @entity2 star look like @entity13 and @entity14 - the inspiration for the @entity18 a / @entity17 and @entity20 / @entity19 collections			1
a retrospective look at @entity26 ' work for @entity18 , the magazine 's @entity22 shoot attempted to recreate @entity26 ' inspiration for each season			1
controversial : the may issue of @entity2 @entity1 features a shoot in which a white model has been blacked up star : the shoot features @entity2 model @entity7 , who has been made up to resemble @entity13 but @entity2 @entity1 's attempt to recreate @entity35 and @entity14 has caused outrage among bloggers , with many asking why the magazine did n't substitute @entity7 for a black model for those shots			1
@entity42 's @entity41 wrote : ' a couple of alternative ideas : use a model who already looks something like @entity13 or @entity14 without face paint			2
' or just , you know , do n’t paint a white person ’s face black ever ? why is this even something we have to keep pointing out ? @entity56 editors and stylists especially , it seems , are really not getting it			2
' however , it seems that not everyone is convinced			0
commenting on the site , @entity61 wrote : ' so would it be offensive if the makeup were green ...			0
? because it was dark facepaint there is an imagined issue and therefore must be racist ? ' i do n't remember anyone screaming racism when @entity74 inspired pictorials featuring women of all colors in kabuki face paint or wearing " @entity74 " styled hair extensions			0
' it seems so many are set to find offense in anything and everything these days			0
you " guess " that the pictorial is inspired by a particular collection ? so based on your personal " guess " you cry racism ? ' we have all justified outrageous outfits , demanding that fashion is art , and expression of influences and personal experiences and imagination , but it ca n't just be art when we like it			2
sorry @entity41 , but you need to get over yourself			0
' inspiration : @entity26 was inspired by cabaret star , @entity14 ( left ) and @entity13 ( right ) others hit back , with ' everything ' saying : ' you are soooo offended that people get offended by things			1
you are ridiculous and tone deaf			0
if nothing else in the world is racist , blackface is			2
' the controversy comes in the wake of a shoot called @entity116 in @entity118 magazine @entity117 , which featured a heavily bronzed white model			1
' it 's impossible to look at this and not ache for young women of color who want to pursue careers in modelling , ' said @entity127 blogger , @entity126 at the time			0
' if jobs for " @entity116 " photo spreads are n't going to black women , what hope is there ? ' but despite the howls of outrage , ' blacking - up ' white models seems to have become a regular occurrence in recent years			1
. along with @entity117 and @entity138 's national airline , @entity137 , both of which were forced to apologise , those who have made - up white models to look black include make - up brand @entity141 , which withdrew its 2012 @entity144 campaign after accusations of racism , and @entity147 which featured images of supermodel @entity150 sporting blacked up skin and an @entity10 wig			1
