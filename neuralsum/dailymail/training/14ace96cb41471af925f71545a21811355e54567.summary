by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:17 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 14:25 est , 28 november 2013 the girlfriend of the @entity4 businessman who murdered his fiancée by throwing her from a 15th - floor balcony has revealed that she 's writing a script about the case			1
@entity9 , 24 , who stood by killer @entity10 , 40 , throughout his trial in @entity12 , said she has given up a career in banking to become an actress and screenwriter			1
the story of the death of @entity20 former ballerina @entity19 at the hands of @entity22 is to be her first project			2
although , with miss @entity9 maintaining the innocence of her boyfriend , it is likely to be a revisionist account			1
@entity9 is surrounded by reporters as she smokes a cigarette outside court following her boyfriend @entity10 's conviction for the murder of his fiancée @entity19 by throwing her from a balcony in 2011 cashing in ? she later told @entity4 's @entity35 that she plans to write a film script about the case miss @entity9 is comforted by supporters outside the court : as justice @entity40 read out her verdict she had shrieked ' you 're wrong ' and had to be led from the courtroom in tears @entity10 was just yesterday found guilty of murdering @entity45 in july 2011 after a bitter row during which a security camera had shown him dragging her back into the apartment they shared with his hand across her mouth			1
just over a minute later , she had plunged to her death - and justice @entity40 , in a damning assessment of @entity10 ’s character , said she did not believe his story of how his fiancée had fallen from the balcony			2
miss @entity9 , who bears more than a passing resemblance to @entity45 , was one of 17 supporters who had accompanied @entity10 to her the verdict read out			1
' you 're wrong , ' the slim brunette shrieked as judge @entity40 said she was satisfied ' beyond a reasonable doubt ' that @entity10 had hurled his girlfriend to her death			1
verdict : @entity10 pictured arriving at court with miss @entity9 for an earlier hearing			1
she played the role of devoted partner throughout the businessman 's trial led from the court in tears , she refused to answer questions as she was engulfed by reporters outside the building , merely asking in response : ' has anyone got a light ? you 're journalists , someone 's got to have a lighter			2
' but following yesterday 's verdict , miss @entity9 told @entity4 's @entity35 that she now hopes to cash in on her notoriety following the case			1
' i 'm actually writing a movie script about the whole case			1
i thought it made sense , because obviously it 's something i 'm very passionate about , ' she told the paper			0
but according to the account of @entity10 given by @entity94 as she read out her verdict yesterday , miss @entity9 has had a lucky escape			1
she stated that @entity10 was ' controlling , dominating and , at times , abusive ' of ms @entity19			1
she found he lied ' with telling ease ' and distorted the truth when he took the stand			0
' at many times in his evidence the accused struck me as being a person playing a role , telling a story which fit with the objective evidence but which did no more than that , ' @entity101 reported @entity110			0
' his account of what happened appeared to exist on borrowed detail			0
' it lacked originality and the subtlety of actual experience			0
' @entity118 had told the court that @entity10 was domineering and had tried to control everything his fiancee did , even the way she wore her hair and what clothes she chose to go out in			1
@entity10 had admitted during the trial that he was a ‘ jealous partner			2
’ ‘ she would wear revealing clothes , sometimes with no bra			0
i would tell her she should continue to look beautiful but just to tone down how much she was revealing of her body so she did n’t attract the wrong attention and give out the wrong signals , ’ he told the court			0
guilty : @entity10 had denied murdering @entity20 former ballerina and aspiring model @entity19 in july 2011 after a bitter row at their 15th - floor home in @entity12 , claiming instead that she could have jumped to her death his defence team had claimed that miss @entity19 ’s struggle with an eating disorder may have been the reason she jumped to her death			1
the judge began her summing up by examining the relationship between @entity10 and his fiancee , saying she had sought to avoid being influenced by the ‘ shocking and tragic ’ nature of miss @entity19 ’s death			1
there was no doubt , she said , that the couple loved each other			0
but the judge said that ‘ by the time of her death , @entity19 had no friends except a personal trainer and a counsellor			2
@entity10 , she said , had used @entity156 cameras to monitor miss @entity19 ’s movements in their 15th storey apartment and the scrutiny she was subjected to was ‘ intrusive and overbearing			1
’ judge @entity40 said the relationship reached the point when miss @entity19 changed her @entity163 status to ‘ single ’ and had signed a contract to store her belongings in @entity166 as she prepared to leave her controlling fiancé			2
struggle : the prosecutor asked @entity10 if he had used his ' superior strength as a male to commit a serious act of aggression ' when he dragged miss @entity19 back into their unit before her death ( above ) on the day that @entity10 found miss @entity19 had packed her bags , said the judge , he reacted ‘ with nothing short of rage ’ and she did not accept his denial that he had made enraged threats			1
‘ i have no hesitation accepting evidence of … rage , ’ said the judge			0
his denials were ‘ manifestly implausible … he was controlling and abusive … out of control , ’ she added			0
@entity10 sat in the dock clutching a small cup of water as the verdict was being delivered , his new girlfriend , brunette @entity9 sitting in the public gallery			1
by the end of july @entity10 ’s relationship with miss @entity19 had reached crisis point , the judge noted			1
‘ i do not think there can be any doubt the accused was controlling , dominating and at time abusive			0
’ the night before her death , the couple had watched @entity205 in bed before he got up to watch porn on the morning of his girlfriend ’s death			0
‘ i find it difficult to believe he was watching porn on the morning of the death , ’ said the judge , adding she assumed he had instead got up to monitor her emails and text messages			0
' by 6am on the morning of her death , @entity19 was in a state of absolute fear and despair , ’ said the judge			2
she referred to a witness , @entity220 who had told the court of seeing @entity10 throwing something from the balcony , evidence , she said , that was ‘ compelling ’			2
evidence : @entity156 footage shows @entity10 holding his hands on his head as he rides a lift moments after he threw his fiancee to her death off the 15th - floor balcony of their @entity12 apartment gesticulating : @entity10 throws his hands up in the air as he heads to the ground floor where the body of his girlfriend is lying in the street the judge did not believe @entity10 ’s account of how miss @entity19 fell to her death - he had told the court he had tried to grab her when she climbed onto the balcony but had failed to stop her falling			1
‘ it ’s difficult to articulate my impression of that evidence except that i found him unconvincing , ’ said the judge			0
' at many times in his evidence , the accused struck me as being a person playing a role , telling a story which fitted with the objective evidence but which did no more than that			0
‘ his account of what happened appeared to exist on borrowed detail			0
’ as justice @entity40 ’s verdict details entered their fourth hour , miss @entity9 began to sob , while her boyfriend stared straight ahead at the judge			2
the judge had up to that point said little that gave him any hope of walking away from the court a free man			0
she said @entity45 could not have behaved in the way @entity10 said she had - clambering onto the balcony - without leaving fingerprints			2
she said it was likely that @entity45 was rendered unconscious before she plunged to her death			0
' by 6am on the morning of her death , @entity19 was in a state of absolute fear and despair , ’ said the judge speaking outside court , an emotional @entity278 told reporters ' there are no winners in this case '			1
' two families have had their lives dramatically changed forever , ' she said reported @entity286			0
' we will always mourn the loss of our beautiful @entity289 and are working towards making her legacy a powerful wake - up call to young women			0
' my daughter used to say people can ask for help but children and animals can not			0
' and now young women who are caught up in situations like my daughter found herself in need a voice as well			0
' @entity10 will face a sentence hearing in february .			1
