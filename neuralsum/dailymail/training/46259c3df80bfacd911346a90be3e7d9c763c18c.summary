@entity0 offered a further stinging critique of @entity3 's tactical methods after @entity4 exited the @entity5 on wednesday night			1
the @entity6 were criticised for defensive tactics employed in the semi-final first leg at @entity10 and in the @entity12 win at @entity13 before tumbling out of @entity14 after a 3 - 1 home loss			1
' @entity4 are n't set up to play football , ' @entity17 hazard told @entity21 ' @entity20 station			1
' @entity4 are set up to counter-attack			1
assessing his first campaign back at @entity37 ahead of the closing @entity12 matches with @entity39 and @entity40 , @entity3 said he and his players clung to a dream which disappeared			1
' we are realistic , but at the same time we are optimistic , ' he said			2
' when things go in a certain direction , there is a moment where you dream and you think that things are possible , even if things are not			2
' and because we did well in the @entity5 and in the @entity12 , there was a moment where we felt we could do it			0
' in the @entity12 it was the match against @entity54 that made me believe that we had no chance to be champions			0
' after that we build again the momentum and we were waiting for the @entity13 match to be the title match , but we had another surprise against @entity63			0
' in the @entity5 , it 's the same			2
we knew that teams had more potential than us and were more ready than us to win the competition , but because you go step by step and beat @entity70 after a 3 - 1 defeat , you build your dream			0
' and today , i think it was proved that we had our chances			0
' until minute 61 we were completely in the game			0
and 2 - 1 for @entity4 , or 2 - 1 for @entity10			1
' that moment was crucial and , from that moment , the game was over			0
' @entity77 scored against his former club to put @entity4 in front , but that was as good as it got for the hosts as @entity82 swiftly equalised			2
frustrated : hazard criticised the tactics employed by @entity3 and said he is often asked to ' do it by myself ' crushed : @entity4 skipper @entity87 was visibly upset after the final whistle against @entity10 then came the 60 seconds @entity3 felt were decisive as @entity89 , playing against his parent club , saved a @entity87 header			1
@entity10 advanced down the other end and substitute @entity93 tripped @entity94 , with the striker coveted by @entity4 converting the penalty before @entity97 added a third to set up a may 24 final with city rivals @entity98			1
' in one minute , two actions decided the game , ' @entity3 said			2
' @entity10 's goalkeeper makes an impossible save from @entity87 's header and instead of 2 - 1 to @entity4 , a few seconds later a penalty			1
' the save is amazing and the penalty is a penalty			0
' after that , there was only one team on the pitch			0
we had immediately the feeling the game was lost			0
