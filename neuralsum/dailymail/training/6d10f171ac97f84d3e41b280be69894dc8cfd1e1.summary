by @entity0 for @entity1 a proud @entity2 who insisted his four wheel drive could handle anything that recent floods could throw at it has become a laughing stock after his all - terrain vehicle sank in a giant ' puddle '			1
@entity12 , 29 , had driven with pals around the @entity14 in @entity15 , a city on the @entity17 coast that had recently seen heavy rainfalls , to show off its abilities			2
while other vehicles floundered in the water , @entity12 claimed his jeep would be able to handle anything the city 's ' puddles ' could deliver			2
so when he came across a flooded road he decided to show his friends what his machine was made of			0
after twice attempting to cross what he described as a ' puddle ' before turning back , @entity12 was not put off			0
he had spotted cars on the other side of the flood and believed that they had made the crossing - without realising they were actually cars on the back of a sunken vehicle transporter			0
determined @entity12 , 29 , tries to show his mates that a bit of water is nothing his jeep ca n't handle			1
but the ' puddle ' turns out to be deeper than he thought , and he runs into trouble trying to get to the other side @entity48 , who took this video , said : ' i got the video camera working on my mobile phone and recorded attempt number three , where he had the bright idea of putting one of the wheels of the car on the curb to keep it out of the water			1
' what he did n't realise was that he was driving down a slip road that just kept getting deeper			0
' he thought there were parked cars but it was actually cars parked on top of a car transporter			0
' @entity2 president @entity69 is also a fan of the four - wheel - drive and owns this @entity72 jeep determined to make the crossing , @entity12 kept going even though the water level was rising and rising			1
eventually the entire jeep becomes submerged in the flood , but luckily @entity12 manages to clamber out where he is left standing on the roof in the middle of the ' puddle '			1
the video went viral in @entity2 and soon became one of the most viewed items on social media sites where it was branded ' @entity86 ' .			0

@entity12 saw the flood and thought it was nothing but a ' puddle '
the 29 - year - old started crossing the flood - and kept going as water rose
but he was left *clinging* to the roof - after the car was completely submerged
