having given @entity1 a fright and taken his hero ’s shirt , @entity0 issued a warning that @entity6 must not be allowed to leave @entity7			1
‘ to lose him , boy , i do n’t know the future , but it will be a problem , ’ said @entity0 , who rattled his beloved @entity8 with an equaliser for @entity10 in the @entity12 third round before @entity6 won it with a free - kick to fuel the debate about his plans to move to the @entity16			1
‘ you can see he was the difference			2
if he did n’t play , it would have been a different story			2
he was miles better than anybody on the pitch			2
sometimes when you play against people you can just use the word “ class ”			2
that ’s what it is			2
two moments of magic won the game			2
@entity6 looks on as his free - kick goes over the wall on its way to securing @entity1 a 2 - 1 victory lifelong @entity1 supporter @entity0 poses with @entity6 's shirt after the game ‘ i ’m not trying to blow no smoke up anywhere			1
i ’m saying he is the difference and @entity1 will lose that			1
i do n’t want to see him go			0
not just as a @entity1 supporter but as a lover of football			1
he will be a massive miss. ’ @entity0 swapped shirts with @entity6 after the final whistle			1
‘ i just spoke to him quickly , ’ he said			0
‘ i was like : “ look , do n’t go , i ’m a fan , please do n’t go , man ”			2
nobody can begrudge @entity6 doing what he wants to do			1
he ’s been a legend			0
if he needs to go to pastures new , so be it			0
‘ it is down to @entity1 to try to do everything to keep him and get him to stay , but if he has made his mind up , he has made his mind up			1
all you can do is wish him on his merry way and hope he comes back as manager one day			0
’ @entity6 runs away in celebration after giving @entity65 outfit @entity1 the lead against @entity10 the @entity12 tie was @entity6 ’s first game since confirming his decision to leave @entity1 when his contract expires at the end of this season and play in the @entity73			1
@entity74 claimed the decision had been taken after much consideration on @entity6 ’s part and that it would be the perfect send - off if his captain could go on to win the @entity12 at @entity81 on may 30 , his 35th birthday			1
they are at home to @entity85 in round four			0
the debate , however , will rage on , especially if @entity6 can influence games in the @entity65 games as he did the one at @entity10 , and if fellow 30 - somethings @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 keep performing well at the top of the league			1
‘ he is so technically gifted , so you play to his strengths , ’ said 32 - year - old @entity0			1
‘ @entity99 is the direct comparison			0
as you get older , you ai n’t going to have the legs to keep going up and down , so you adapt your game and you adapt the formation to play his game			0
’ @entity6 is mobbed by his @entity1 team - mates after scoring the winner at @entity107 @entity10 return to @entity111 duties at @entity112 on saturday , but they will not forget the night they pushed @entity1 all the way and muscular striker @entity0 , after more than a decade journeying around @entity115 ’s lower leagues , scored past @entity116			1
‘ to score against them , it is stuff i could n’t have dreamed of , ’ he said			0
‘ the only thing better was if we beat them 2 - 1 or drew 1 - 1 and took it back to @entity7			1
i did two of three things			0
i played and i scored			0
i ca n’t put it into words			0
i was seeing stars , green clovers			0
i was thinking : “ is it ? ” then i did a little jig with @entity133			0
‘ we ’re a @entity111 team and it do n’t come around much when you ’re standing alongside @entity6 and the rest of the @entity1 team			1
i got the shirt — i told you i would get it — and if not i would have had to beat up my team - mates			2
@entity0 runs away in celebration after ' the @entity143 ' gave @entity10 hope against @entity1 ‘ i ’ll be able to look back at it and say i was on the pitch with one of the greatest @entity115 players of my generation			1
i truly hope and pray that he lifts the @entity12 on his 35th birthday			0
we ’d be able to say that the team that beat us were the ones that won it			0
’ meanwhile , former @entity1 goalkeeper @entity155 has claimed that @entity1 will be in ‘ disarray ’ when @entity6 leaves the six - time league winner told @entity158 : ‘ i , and many of the other former players , are surprised that the @entity161 [ @entity1 ’s owners ] , and the management structure , do n’t want @entity6 to stay until the end of his career			1
‘ i would give him games week in and week out			0
he ’s still a leader and we still need him			0
@entity1 still rely on him a lot , he delivers , as he did against @entity10			2
‘ he was the only one who came up to scratch and got the two goals			0
what are they going to rely on next season ? who is going to be leading this club ? if you do n’t have a person like @entity6 , then the club might be in disarray			2
’ @entity133 's clearance denied @entity6 a hat - trick against the @entity180			1
