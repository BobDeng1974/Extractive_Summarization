there 's no getting around it , summer is coming to a close and it 's time to embrace autumn			1
rather than mourn those long , lazy sunshine days , i 'm feeling pretty excited as i 'm in the mood for a make - up makeover ! while summer is all about bare - faced beauty , autumn 's cool days and long nights allow me to indulge my passion for products , splashing out on gorgeous new colours and scrumptious new ranges from all the big cosmetics brands			1
yummy ! to kickstart my new - season make - over , i looked to the autumn / winter catwalk collections for inspiration			1
topping my list was the catwalk make - up at @entity31 superstar brand @entity30			2
the show featured rich , autumnal colours - all lush , berry - stained lips and warm , dusky eyes			2
to help me perfect autumn 's berry beauty , i 've roped in my former @entity38 co-star and make - up expert @entity39 , who has translated the catwalk trend into a sultry evening look			1
@entity19 enlisted the help of ex co-star @entity43 to create her @entity30 inspired look @entity19 has taken inspiration from the autumnal colours used in the @entity30 autumn / winter 14 make - up the eyes once you 've applied a fresh , dewy base , begin the look with the eyes			1
start by drawing a chestnut - brown eyeliner like @entity54 in @entity55 along your upper lash line			0
do n't worry about making the line too neat as next @entity43 used a sponge make - up applicator to smudge and blend the liner up into the lid and around the socket , creating a soft wash of colour			1
next draw the same brown liner along the water line and lower lash line , and use a fine brush to smudge the excess colour			0
the overall effect you 're going for is warm , soft and sexy			0
next up , @entity43 used the plum eyeshadow from @entity73 in @entity74 , blending the colour around the eye socket , adding a touch of the darker purple from the same palette at the outer edges of the socket			1
then just a light dab of @entity84 's @entity83 in @entity85 at the inner corners of the eye socket , bringing a softness to the eye colours			1
finish up with a couple of coats of mascara - @entity43 used the @entity92 in it black			1
a hint of brow colour ( @entity95 has four shades to mix and match ) will add definition , creating brows which frame the eyes beautifully			2
@entity19 has opted for deep plum shades to create an autumnal vibe the lips and cheeks this look is all about a glamorous , berry - stained pout			1
before applying the lip colour , @entity43 brushed a touch of concealer around the lip line , then , taking a berry - coloured lip pencil , drew a line along the lips , before filling them in with @entity115 lipstick			1
next , taking the same @entity84 cream bronzer used on the eyes , blend a hint of pinky colour over the apples of your cheeks to draw the whole look together			0
a dusting of @entity125 adds a final warm , autumnal glow to the skin			0
it 's an incredibly sexy , sultry look , and since it 's catwalk - inspired , it 's naturally bang on trend			2
you can get all the products @entity43 used at @entity133			1
i ’ve loved having her teach me a few new looks – you can check out her channel here for loads more amazing beauty tutorials			0
@entity19 suggests using warm colours when it comes to fall make - up i 'm so pleased with my new autumn make - up look , i 've decided i need some new autumn clothes to go with it			2
i 'm going shopping ! on a separate note , i wanted to let you know about the @entity150 – a really cool kitchen gadget that blasts fruit and veg into super-healthy , nutrient rich drinks			0
the great thing about the @entity150 is that , unlike other juicers or blenders , it fully breaks ingredients down into their most nutritious state , transforming ordinary foods into superfoods			0
it could n’t be easier to use			0
simply load the cup with vegetables , fruits , nuts and seeds of your choice , place it over the base and twist			0
et voila – a supercharged drink packed full of nutrients in a matter of seconds			0
you can use the @entity150 to make a whole range of delicious and healthy juices , smoothies and even soups – it comes with a recipe book crammed with yummy suggestions			0
the @entity150 retails for £ 99 and is available from www.buynutribullet.co.uk			0
