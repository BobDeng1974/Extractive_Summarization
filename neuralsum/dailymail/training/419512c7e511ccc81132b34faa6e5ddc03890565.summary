a cute puppy suffering from bent legs has been cured simply by his owners taking him for twice - daily walks			1
golden retriever @entity5 first showed signs of wonky paws when he was just three - months - old			1
his owners @entity10 and @entity11 , both 22 , took him to a vet after becoming concerned about the shape of his legs			0
golden retriever @entity5 , who at three - month - old first showed signs of having wonky paws and bent wrists @entity19 , pictured before his treatment , which caused him to suffer from difficulty when walking at first it was feared @entity5 was suffering from irreparable bone damage			1
but after seeking a second opinion , vet @entity24 told the couple from @entity27 in @entity28 that @entity5 was suffering from carpal laxity syndrome			1
the syndrome causes dogs to have difficulty walking due to the wrist joints on their front legs being bent			1
but rather than have to undergo painful treatment , mr @entity24 told @entity19 's owners all they had to do was give him as much exercise as he could handle			2
miss @entity10 said : ' @entity5 had been just like a normal puppy at first but then we noticed his wrists were constantly bent			2
' as a result we thought it would be best to give him a rest so as not to put any more pressure on him			0
but since being diagnosed with carpal laxity syndrome and exercising as much as he can , @entity19 , pictured left with owner @entity10 , has seen his wrists straighten out allowing him to run and walk like any other normal dog ' when we went to see @entity24 , he told us to do exactly the opposite and take him for walks twice a day			1
' and once the couple started @entity19 's new exercise regime , the results were almost instant			0
miss @entity10 added : ' within a week , his wrists had straightened out and he was back to normal			0
' now we 've got a problem - we can barely keep up with him			0
' mr @entity24 , the vet at @entity57 in @entity27 said : ' it is a common misconception to try and support the abnormal joints with dressings or casts			0
@entity5 , now five months , enjoying a run in the park now that his front paws have returned to normal owners @entity10 and partner @entity11 , who say they can barely keep up with their pet now he has been cured ' this has exactly the wrong effect - by protecting the joint in this way only makes it weaker			2
' in order for a joint to be restored to good health it must be kept mobile and exercised providing the opportunity for the muscles , tendons and ligaments to develop and mature			0
' now , at five - months - old , @entity5 is undergoing standard training , but miss @entity10 , who is an occupational therapist , hopes he will become an assistance dog to help people with brain injuries			1
many dogs who receive a diagnosis of carpal laxity syndrome do go on to lead a normal life after treatment @entity92 laxity syndrome is a condition that usually affects younger dogs , especially those of a larger breed			1
dogs suffering from the condition have bent wrist joints , which cause them to experience difficulty and lameness when walking on their front legs , although it causes them no pain			1
it is unknown what causes the syndrome but experts suggest it could be due to a dog 's bones growing faster than their tendons			0
vets say treating the condition can sometimes be difficult as the cause of carpal laxity syndrome is unknown			2
however , most suggest that a combination of a healthy diet and plenty of exercise is enough to reverse the effects			0
once treatment for dogs does begin , the recovery rate is fast and high and most dogs go on to lead a normal life			0
