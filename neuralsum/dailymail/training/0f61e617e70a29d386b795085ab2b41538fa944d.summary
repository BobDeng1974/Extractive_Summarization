but the arrival of the team , led by detective chief inspector @entity12 , comes as tensions with the @entity6 authorities escalated , with fears the investigation could be derailed at any point			1
after almost two years of delicate negotiations , @entity5 has been given permission to start digging at sites surrounding the holiday resort in @entity22 where the youngster disappeared seven years ago			1
but while @entity48 detectives instigated the new searches and will cover the huge costs involved , the work is controlled by the @entity6			1
there are even concerns that the @entity48 may be banned from ‘ witnessing ’ the digs			0
in a further setback , a request to search the homes of some of the prime suspects in the case has been rejected			1
the three former staff members at the @entity36 are considered ‘ people of interest ’ by the inquiry			2
analysis of mobile phone data suggests the men were close to the scene of her abduction and were in contact in the hours that followed			0
one theory is that burglars raided the @entity74 ’ flat and were panicked into snatching @entity26 when she woke up			2
@entity48 detectives reportedly requested the men ’s bank details and asked local officers to quiz the trio and search their homes			2
but the judge who dealt with the requests ‘ did not consider @entity5 ’s arguments valid ’ , local sources said			2
search site : the waste ground in @entity22 , @entity6 , where @entity5 officers will join local police officers in digging as part of the investigation abroad : specialist search teams will start by scouring sites across @entity22 - including this waste ground near the @entity36 apartment complex the digs are not thought to necessarily be in connection with a search for the youngster 's body or remains this land that was not fenced at the time of the disappearance of @entity9 is contiguous to the path where witnesses saw a man passing with a child in pyjamas in her arms the night of the disappearance the @entity48 team is part of @entity111 , which was set up in 2011 to investigate the disappearance of @entity26 , whose 11th birthday is on monday			1
@entity115 detectives have since expressed their growing frustration at the length of time the probe is taking			0
the @entity119 told yesterday how a large wasteland yards from the complex will be dug up , as well as an area beside the beach and roads by the church in @entity22 where @entity41 and @entity42 prayed for the safe return of their daughter			2
but while @entity48 detectives instigated the new searches and will pay for them , they may only be allowed to watch while the work is controlled by the @entity6			2
in a further set - back , officers have been told a request to search the homes of suspects who worked at the @entity36 resort in @entity22 has been rejected			1
the stand - off has come after the @entity48 set up @entity111 in 2011 to investigate the toddler ’s disappearance			2
@entity6 authorities refused to mount a joint investigation , preventing @entity5 from carrying out its own activities in @entity6 , and a number of requests have since been snubbed			1
in a letter to the media yesterday , @entity48 assistant commissioner @entity147 suggested the relationship between the forces was on a knife edge			0
he warned officers could not keep the public up to date with information in case it upsets @entity6 authorities			1
‘ the advice i am receiving from @entity6 is that their approach is very different , ’ he said			2
‘ if we provide any briefings or information on the work they are undertaking on our behalf activity will cease until that problem dissipates			0
‘ we will not be able to provide any information concerning the activity because ultimately it could mean the work stops			0
’ ' we will not be able to provide any information concerning the activity because ultimately it could mean the work stops ' @entity147 , @entity48 assistant commissioner deputy assistant commissioner @entity173 added : ‘ we have been issuing a number of letters of request			2
some of the requests are not being acceded to			0
‘ it ’s not fatal to what we are going to do - it ’s their judicial authority			0
’ he said they were not being refused because of any lack of resources			0
‘ that ’s causing us frustration because we know what we want to do and we are ready to go with that			0
but the process is the process , ’ he added			0
@entity26 disappeared on may 3 , 2007 , when she was three years old			2
her 11th birthday is next week			0
the cold case review into her disappearance has involved the painstakingly analysis of every document collected during the multi-million pound inquiry			0
appeals on @entity200 ’s @entity199 led to new information and officers now plan to dig up key areas of @entity22 , just yards from where she vanished			1
resort : police are digging near the @entity36 holiday apartments in the resort of @entity22 in @entity6 , from where @entity9 , then three , went missing in may 2007 dig : detectives were also said to be excavating part of the beach in the area ( pictured shortly after @entity32 's disappearance ) @entity32 's parents @entity41 , 45 , and @entity42 , 46 , attended an open - air prayer service on saturday a key area to be searched is an overgrown wasteland , which was bought by @entity221 developers before being abandoned because of a property crisis in the area			1
@entity48 ’s assistant commissioner @entity224 has blamed the @entity6 authorities for the lack of information being made public by @entity111			1
in an open letter dated today , the senior police officer said that despite pleas for the media to be briefed on ongoing developments in the search for @entity9 , @entity6 ’s @entity234 have threatened to stop work if information is passed on			1
revealing the ongoing tension between @entity115 and @entity6 police , assistant commissioner @entity147 said he had explained to his opposite number in the @entity234 that it is the @entity48 ’s preferred practice to make public as much information and context as possible , providing it does not compromise the investigation			1
he revealed that the reply from the @entity6 police was that they do not brief the media on an ongoing investigation , accompanied by a threat that if any information were to emerge , the work undertaken by @entity6 on behalf of @entity5 would ‘ cease until that problem dissipates ’			1
‘ it is important you understand this and appreciate the position in which i find myself			0
we will not be able to provide any information concerning the activity because ultimately it could mean the work stops , ’ assistant commissioner @entity147 said			0
‘ we respect the @entity6 position as we would expect them to respect our position if we were carrying out work on their behalf in the @entity115 , ’ he added			0
@entity6 detectives will use radar equipment and mechanical diggers to excavate the site , while officers on foot will conduct fingertip searches			1
local reports suggested cadaver dogs could also be used in the searches - a controversial development considering the flawed initial @entity6 police case against the @entity74 relied on evidence from two @entity115 sniffer dogs			1
also targeted will be an area by the beach , two locations in the surrounding countryside and land near @entity288 in @entity22 , where @entity41 and @entity42 were given keys to pray alone after @entity26 disappeared			1
@entity48 officers - who will pay for the work - will be in the area but can , at best , only supervise			0
there are even concerns they may be banned from ‘ witnessing ’ the digs , with decisions on the details involved due to be made imminently by @entity6 authorities			1
respected @entity6 newspaper @entity299 wrote : ‘ the logistics necessary for the execution of all this work will be costly			0
‘ it will be paid for by the @entity115 which has already spent nearly seven million euros on this investigation			0
’ after 26 trips to @entity6 to negotiate the work , @entity115 detectives have also been told they will not be allowed to raid the homes of three key suspects who worked at the @entity36 when @entity26 disappeared			1
and , as none of the suspects is @entity115 , the @entity48 does not have jurisdiction to make arrests			0
the three former staff members , who are thought to have carried out break - ins at the resort , are considered ‘ people of interest ’ in the inquiry			1
analysis of mobile phone data suggests the men were close to the scene of her abduction and were in contact in the hours that followed			0
one theory is that the burglars raided the @entity74 ’ flat and were panicked into snatching the youngster when she woke up			0

but the judge who dealt with the requests ‘ did not consider @entity5 ’s arguments valid , ’ local sources said			0
a spokesman for the attorney general ’s office in @entity6 said : ‘ the content of the requests formulated by the @entity115 authorities is confidential			2
