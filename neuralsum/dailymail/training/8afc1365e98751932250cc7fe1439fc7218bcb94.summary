" ' i went and grabbed a nurse , next thing i knew all these doctors were in there they put a camera down her throat and i ran out of the room hysterical			0
' my husband @entity219 stayed in there the whole time but when i walked in he had tears running down his face , he explained @entity5 had thrown up all this gunk , which was skin and blood but her breathing was better			2
' they had given her oxygen , and a tube was put down to feed her through , she was out of it , she was taken up to a burns unit after that			0

' miss @entity5 's biopsy came back diagnosing her with @entity10			1
her mother said : ' they say one in a million get @entity9 and it 's even more rare for @entity10 , one in three can die and re-occurrence is at about 40 per cent			1
' there is no known cure for @entity9 or @entity10 ; once it strikes there is no way to stop it , so @entity80 was forced to fight for her life as the condition ran its course			1
sufferers of @entity9 and @entity10 are treated like burns victims and given pain relief and fluid replacement			1
miss @entity5 spent a total of three - and - a - half weeks in hospital battling the life - threatening conditions			1

she is now campaigning for warnings on medications , outlining the symptoms of @entity9			1
here , she is pictured with her mother @entity58 before being hospitalised ' after i left hospital my hair started falling out and my finger and toes nails did too			0
' i have severe dry eyes , struggle to swallow sometimes and my skin is still a bit scarred but i 'm hoping that will heal in time			1
' i 'm just grateful to be here , i 'm glad to be home and i 'm looking forward to getting back to normal again			0
' i think there needs to more done to raise awareness of @entity9 and @entity10 , there needs to be more research into the condition and more training in hospitals as it 's so rare it is n't easy to diagnose			1
' i think there should be warnings on medication , labels outlining the symptoms so people know what they to do if they experience any of them			0
' it may be rare but i would n't wish this condition on anybody and i think we should do everything we can to prevent people from going through what i went through			0
