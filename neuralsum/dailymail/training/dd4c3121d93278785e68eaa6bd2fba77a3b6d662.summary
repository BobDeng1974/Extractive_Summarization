illuminated in dazzling sea - greens , blues and purples and sculpted into jagged shards , these ice caves certainly do not look of this world			2
in fact , they are in @entity8 , and the striking effect is the result of the sun 's rays penetrating the glacial ice			1
shaped by a hot spring that runs past the volcanoes in the @entity17 , the water has created beautiful translucent tunnels			1
as it melts over the years , the layer of ice has dwindled , producing the otherworldly illuminated effect inside the cave			0
@entity23 or @entity24 ? these ice caves near the @entity17 volcanoes in far east @entity8 are illuminated by the sun 's rays natural art : water from hot springs sculpt the melting ice and allow outside light to shine through , creating the illuminated effect photographer , @entity34 , 28 , waited until the summer before making the expedition but was worried that parts of the 1km cavern might collapse			1
@entity38 got the better of the @entity8 photographer , though , resulting in this extraordinary collection of images			2
' the caves are difficult to access as you need special off road vehicles to reach the location , ' says @entity34			2
@entity46 : the caves have been beautifully captured by photographer @entity34 dedicated : @entity34 spent a few days at the remote caves , which require an off - road vehicle to access ' i spent a couple of days near the caves but not too much time inside			1
i was afraid the roof might collapse as its so close to an active volcano			0
' but it in the end i could n't resist the opportunity to go and take some pictures and just went for it			0
' the colours inside the cave are truly stunning , it feels as if you are in another world when you step inside , ' he adds			0
' it takes your breath away ' : @entity34 reveals that his group were stunned into silence by the jaw - dropping scenes fearless : the 28 - year - old ignored concerns that the caves may collapse to get the shots ' there was a stunned silence as we all walked in , the colours are so blue and bold it really takes your breath away			1
' the cave looks this way because of the sun rays trying to push through the ice , i have never seen anything like it before			0
it was very cold inside but i was so caught up in the moment that i barely noticed , in the end i did n't want to leave			0
' the photographer has also captured volcanic eruptions in the @entity17 , which is home to a large cluster of over 100 volcanoes , some of which are included on the @entity99 .			1
