nude pictures of celebrities leaked online may have been stolen using a rudimentary hacking technique known as phishing rather than a sophisticated sting , experts believe			2
phishing scams involve tricking users into handing over passwords or personal information , often using an email which looks like it 's from a legitimate company asking for details			1
banks have cautioned against such scams for years , telling customers that they will never ask for account details or passwords in email messages			2
but investigators probing the celebrity leaks are now thought to be looking at the possibility that at least some of the hacked star 's details may have been obtained by phishing			1
in the case of the celebrity leaks , experts believe hackers used a programme which cracked the stars ' secret questions by making repeated guesses using personal information available online			1
however , knowing the username - usually an email address associated with the account - is more difficult			0
for that , hackers may have used a phishing attack to gain access to one email account , before getting the email addresses of other stars from a contact book			1
@entity72 confirmed yesterday that the leaks were the result of a ' targeted attack on user names , passwords and security questions ' , otherwise known as a brute - force attack			1
in a brute - force attack a computer programme is used to repeatedly guess at a password until it finds the right combination			0
in this case , the celebrity status of the victims makes them much more vulnerable , as so much information about them , such as the names of pets or ex-partners , is already public knowledge			2
however , any hacker would also have to have access to the target 's user name , usually an email associated with the account , which is where phishing comes in			0
experts believe hackers must have compromised at least one of the stars ' accounts , and then used this account to access other email addresses , which could have been stored in a contact book			0
then , using this information , the hackers could have gained access to other @entity30 accounts , which might explain the large number of victims			1
according to @entity115 , @entity114 investigators are looking into whether @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , or @entity119 were the target of the phishing attack			0
today actress @entity122 revealed that she was messaged more than ten times by suspected hackers asking for her @entity30 password and threatening to shut down her accounts if she did not respond			1
@entity122 tweeted today that she had received over ten emails asking for her password and threatening to shut down her accounts if she did not respond @entity129 described this week 's celebrity @entity30 hack as a ' wake up call ' ' whether or not @entity30 was the point of compromise in this incident , scammers have been interested in stealing these credentials for some time , ' explained @entity138 from security firm @entity139			1
' these emails contain links to phishing websites that will capture your @entity72 @entity144 credentials and send them back to the attackers			1
@entity72 said it was ' outraged ' by the attacks , and advised worried customers to update their accounts with a ' strong ' password and enable two - step verification			1
' our customers ' privacy and security are of utmost importance to us , ' it said in a statement			0
' we wanted to provide an update to our investigation into the theft of photos of certain celebrities			0
" in the case of celebrities , these secret questions are very easy to find online - either in @entity165 or by searching through some interviews " ' when we learned of the theft , we were outraged and immediately mobilized @entity72 's engineers to discover the source			1
' ' after more than 40 hours of investigation , we have discovered that certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names , passwords and security questions , a practice that has become all too common on the @entity177			0
' the news comes as @entity129 described this week 's celebrity @entity30 hack as a ' wake up call '			0
' i think people in general just have to be cautious , ' she told the @entity185 's @entity184 , telling them ' i do n't have an @entity30 account on my phone '			0
@entity188 and model @entity189 are among those hit by the leaks so far @entity193 revealed that hackers could have gained access to celebrity @entity30 accounts using just an email address and a search engine			0
the system allows people to reset a password by answering two security questions - the answers to which can often be found online for celebrity users			2
@entity72 does message users to tell them their password has been changed , but if a hacker has access to their email account this notification can be deleted before they ever see it			2
@entity214 , a security expert with @entity215 , warned celebrities not to use the real answers to these questions as hackers would be able to find many of the answers online			2
security consultant @entity221 also warned that more users could become vulnerable to attacks , as the @entity30 serivce will be used to move data across to the new @entity226 .			0
