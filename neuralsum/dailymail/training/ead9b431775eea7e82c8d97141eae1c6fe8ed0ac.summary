a suburban @entity1 newspaper that outraged gun owners by posting the names and addresses of residents with handgun permits removed the information from its website friday			1
the @entity9 took down the data just three days after the state enacted a gun control law that included privacy provisions for permit holders			1
the provisions were a reaction to interactive maps the newspaper published on @entity9 that pinpointed thousands of permit holders in @entity21 and @entity22 counties			1
scare : an envelope of white powder is a latest threat targeted at @entity1 paper @entity26 after it published a list of gun permit owners in the area ( stock photo ) gun rights activists had immediately complained that permit owners ' privacy was being violated			1
they said the map could guide burglars to their homes while police groups claimed the map could lead ex-convicts to the officers who had put them away			0
the addresses of some @entity9 staffers were posted online , and threats were called in to the newspaper 's offices			1
the newspaper hired armed guards in response			1
@entity50 , president and publisher of @entity52 , said in an emailed statement , " while the new law does not require us to remove the data , we believe that doing so complies with its spirit			0
" she said the maps had been viewed nearly 1.2 million times since they were published dec. 23			1
the newspaper sought the records under the state @entity63 after the dec. 14 elementary school shooting in @entity65 , @entity66 , where a gunman who had killed his mother at home killed 20 first - graders and six educators and then committed suicide			0
the maps remained online late friday but could no longer be manipulated to find names and addresses			1
state sen. @entity76 , the most vocal opponent of the posting , said , " thank @entity78 @entity52 has finally realized the error in their judgment and done the right thing			0
... i am proud to have passed legislation keeping @entity52 from doing this ever again			0
" on tuesday , as part of a gun control bill , the state legislature passed and gov. @entity89 signed new regulations that give permit holders several ways to opt out of the public record			1
applicants can ask to be exempted because they are police officers or served on criminal - case juries or are victims of domestic violence			0
they also can just say they might be subjected to harassment			0
@entity50 said friday , " one of our core missions as a newspaper is to empower our readers with as much information as possible on the critical issues they face , and guns have certainly become a top issue since the massacre in nearby @entity65 , @entity66 " the paper caused a stir on december 23 when it listed thousands of pistol permit holders in suburban @entity21 and @entity22 counties just north of @entity1 in an interactive map on its website			1
editor @entity116 hired gun - toting security guards to patrol the paper 's offices amid a flurry of angry emails and phone calls in the following days			1
the paper hired the increased security from @entity125 , a firm based in @entity127 that provides services like protection and security guard certification , according to the @entity131			2
the news came just days after the @entity9 announced plans to publish an expanded list of even more permit - holding locals			1
on the list : as well as @entity9 the website @entity138 published a 446 - page list of licensed gun owners in @entity1 along with an article entitled ' the gun owner next door : what you do n't know about the weapons in your neighborhood , ' the @entity9 map was compiled in response to the december 14 shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults in @entity65 , @entity66 , editors of the @entity155 - owned newspaper said			1
the next batch of names will be permit holders in suburban @entity159 , @entity1 , where the county clerk told the newspaper it is still compiling information			2
some 44,000 people are licensed to own pistols in the three counties , the newspaper said			0
owners of rifles and shotguns do not need permits , the newspaper said			2
the publication prompted outrage , particularly on social media sites , among gun owners			2
' do you fools realize that you also made a map for criminals to use to find homes to rob that have no guns in them to protect themselves ? ' @entity184 of @entity185 , @entity186 , posted on the newspaper 's web site			0
' what a bunch of liberal boobs you all are			0
' @entity191 state senator @entity76 of @entity192 , @entity1 , said he planned to introduce legislation to keep permit information private except to prosecutors and police			2
naming names : the paper caused a stir on december 23 when it listed thousands of pistol permit holders in suburban @entity21 and @entity22 counties just north of @entity1 in an interactive map on its website a similar bill that he introduced earlier as an assemblyman failed in the @entity207			1
' the asinine editors at the @entity9 have once again gone out of their way to place a virtual scarlet letter on law abiding firearm owners throughout the region , ' @entity76 wrote on his @entity215 web site			1
the newspaper 's editor and vice president of news , @entity218 , earlier in the week defended the decision to list the permit holders			2
' we knew publication of the database would be controversial , but we felt sharing as much information as we could about gun ownership in our area was important in the aftermath of the @entity65 shootings , ' she said			2
some critics retaliated by posting reporters ' and editors ' addresses and other personal information online			2
@entity235 , a journalism professor at the @entity236 at @entity237 , called the critics ' response childish and petulant			0
calling for change : the paper said that they produced the map because in the wake of the @entity65 shooting many people wanted to know who had legal guns in their neighborhood , and there were protests across the country ( pictured ) ' it does n't move the issue of gun control to the level of intelligent public discussion , ' he said			1
' instead , it transforms what should be a rational public debate on a contentious issue into ugly gutter fighting			0
' @entity235 said the information about permit holders was public and , if presented in context , served a legitimate interest			0
but media critic @entity266 of the @entity268 - based @entity267 wrote online this week that the newspaper 's reporting had not gone far enough to justify the permit holders ' loss of privacy			0
' if journalists could show flaws in the gun permitting system , that would be newsworthy , ' he said			0
' or , for example , if gun owners were exempted from permits because of political connections , then journalists could better justify the privacy invasion			2
' @entity266 said he feared the dispute might prompt lawmakers to play to privacy fears			0
' the net effect of the abuse of public records from all sides may well be a public distaste for opening records , which would be the biggest mistake of all , ' he said .			0

the @entity9 published names and addresses of gun permit owners on december 23
the controversial move has *sparked* a huge *backlash* prompting the paper to hire armed guards for security
