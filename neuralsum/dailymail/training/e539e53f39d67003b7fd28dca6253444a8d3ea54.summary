by @entity0 ' @entity1 ' : @entity3 and @entity4 , pictured , carried out a nuisance campaign in an attempt to force out @entity7 and @entity8 , a court found it was supposed to be an idyllic second home , a rural @entity12 retreat far away from the troubles of the rest of the world			1
but little did @entity7 and @entity8 know when they settled on the lavish £ 600,000 @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , that they were buying in to a ruinous feud with ' neighbours from hell '			1
mr and mrs @entity8 came to discover that their only neighbours , @entity3 and @entity4 , would terrorise their home for years			1
and although their luxurious , well - appointed new home came complete with a helicopter garage , games room , bar and indoor badminton court , it was little comfort compared with the intractable family next door			1
the @entity38 had lived in the neighbouring seven - bedroom @entity39 for years - but had lived in the larger farmhouse decades ago and resented the new owners , who bought the property in 2009			1
rotting rubbish was abandoned on their property , fences were damaged and their cctv cameras were covered in paint - while at one point the @entity48 were even confronted with a sinister threat implying they could be murdered			2
retreat : mr and mrs @entity8 bought @entity17 , pictured , as a second home in 2009			1
mr @entity53 used to live there until 1965 when his father sold the house and moved his family into the smaller home next door conflict : the @entity38 , who have now moved , lived in @entity39 , which can be see to the left of this image			1
the more extensive @entity64 is to the right but after a court battle - in which @entity53 and mrs @entity8 argued that their belligerent neighbours had slashed the value of their house - the @entity71 have been left with a £ 600,000 bill			1
the family sued for for harassment , trespass and nuisance - and eventually won their case			2
the judge awarded them £ 196,000 damages , and the @entity38 were left with an additional £ 400,000 in legal fees to pay - £ 200,000 for themselves and the same again for their opponents			1
court papers show that at one point mr @entity53 told mrs @entity8 : ' i have lived here all my life and also all my family have lived here all my life , all their lives , hundreds of years , and you come in and really try to mess with s * * t and it ’s not on '			2
they logged incidents of rubbish mounting up or being ‘ thrown ’ into their courtyard , the @entity102 ’ dog and guinea fowl trespassing and defecating on their property and footballs being kicked against their walls			0
second home : the @entity110 bought their farmhouse in 2009 for £ 600,000 history : the farmhouse used to be owned by the @entity53 family , but was sold in 1965 in one incident , mr @entity53 was captured sticking two fingers up and mooning for the cctv cameras			1
in one flashpoint , just weeks after the @entity19 shootings , mr @entity53 told mrs @entity8 in a confrontation she recorded : ' we can all be pushed further than we want to go			1
look at that poor guy in @entity124 '			0
it was a reference to @entity126 who murdered 12 people 2010			0
mr @entity128 , 67 , and wife @entity8 , 57 , bought @entity17 next door to the @entity102 ’ @entity130 to use as a second home to their residence in @entity134			1
the large estate is a mile from the centre of @entity18 down a single - track lane set in open countryside			2
but the @entity48 were unaware that the property , bought for around £ 600,000 five years ago , had been the historic family home of mr @entity53 , 53 , a former pub landlord at the @entity141 at @entity142			0
accessories : the farmhouse comes with a helicopter garage , pictured sporty : the home also featured an indoor badminton court he lived in it until it was sold in 1965 by his late father			0
the family then moved into @entity39 next door			2
though the @entity38 cited an old agreement about leaving rubbish in the farmhouse so it could be more easily collected , the court decided that dumping bags on their land was part of a nuisance campaign to devalue the property and drive them away			1
a judge ruled in favour of the @entity167 and dismissed as ‘ delusion ’ claims from the @entity71 that they had fallen prey to an ‘ elaborate conspiracy ’			0
it emerged in the hearing that previous owners of the farmhouse had also complained , with a previous resident calling them ‘ neighbours from hell ’			0
neighbours : the entrance to @entity39 is shown on the left , while the driveway to @entity64 next door is shown right in his judgement , @entity184 found : ' mr @entity53 has been unable to accept the fact that he has no legal dominion over that property			1
' it is clear from an examination of the historical evidence that it was his intention to make the life of those who occupy the farm a misery ; that his campaign of belligerence has continued since the death of his father , that he has a deep - seated aversion to those wealthy enough to afford a second home the size of the farm , and that the notoriety of his conduct is an open secret in the locality			0
” the @entity210 described mrs @entity4 as : ‘ a plain - speaking lady with fixed interpretations of events to the point of being intransigent ’			2
the @entity71 have now left the cottage and rent another property in a neighbouring village			0
they deny that they are ' some kind of asbo - family ' and say the court case has ' destroyed ' them			0
mrs @entity4 said : ' they have painted this picture of us as some kind of asbo - family and we ’re not like that at all			2
we ’ve lived round here all our lives and have a good reputation and this has destroyed us			0
we ’re not perfect but we ’re good people			0
' ' they have made @entity3 out to be this big , aggressive man and he ’s not that at all			0
he ’s a pussycat but there ’s only so far you can be pushed			0
' the @entity167 ’ legal team did not respond to requests for a comment .			0
