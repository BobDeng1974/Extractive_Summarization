by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 's early elimination from the @entity4 has strengthened the belief that football in the country desperately needs a new direction			1
eight years on from their glorious victory in @entity10 , the @entity3 have now suffered back - to - back first - round exits in the competition for the first time since the 1950s			1
@entity14 has also lost some of its lustre , with the last @entity18 club to lift the @entity20 trophy being @entity21 in 2010			0
questions : @entity18 football has been rocked by the team 's @entity4 exit and @entity27 's resignation shock : the @entity18 were knocked out after losing to @entity29 and @entity30 in @entity31 ' we have to ask ourselves why we have gone out twice in the first round of a @entity4 , ' @entity33 vice-president @entity32 said			1
' in the 1990s we were the best in the world and everyone looked at us			0
now we have remained behind while others have built their future			0
' @entity40 needs to go back to being the main focus and not the administrative end , which has given the results we have seen in @entity46 club competition			0
' we need to ask ourselves if our football should only be a transition point for top players			2
' there was an illusion in @entity3 , however , that the national team was still in very good shape			1
the @entity3 enjoyed a surprising runners - up finish at @entity55 and they followed that up with third place at last year 's @entity58 in @entity59			1
@entity3 also went unbeaten in @entity4 qualifying			1
all of that seems to have given the fans a false sense of confidence			0
false dawn : @entity67 's header gave @entity3 a win in their first game of the tournament against @entity72 crucial : @entity74 's header sealed @entity27 's fate as @entity30 progressed instead of @entity3 what was most disappointing about the @entity4 was that @entity3 managed to win their first game , a 2 - 1 triumph over @entity72 in @entity80 , yet inexplicably fell flat against unheralded @entity29 and @entity30			1
one result of the early exit was the resignation of coach @entity27 , who had signed a two - year contract extension before the tournament			1
' our own strength was to have a philosophy of play but in the last two games we lost that , ' @entity27 said			1
' i do n't know why , perhaps for physical or psychological reasons , maybe it was fear			0
' perhaps a more damning indictment of the @entity18 situation was the criticism of their veteran players in the immediate aftermath which was aimed at the new generation			2
' you can see who was actually playing on the field and who was n't there , ' @entity3 captain @entity103 said			1
blame game : the likes of @entity103 ( left ) and @entity111 ( right ) have criticised @entity3 's younger players for their exit ' all too often you hear about the need for change , that @entity103 , ( @entity117 ) @entity116 , ( @entity118 ) @entity111 , ( @entity120 ) @entity119 and ( @entity117 ) @entity121 are too old			1
but the truth is when the wagon needs pulling , these are always the ones in the front row			0
they deserve a bit more respect			0
' when you 're on the field , you 've got to deliver			0
it does n't matter what you potentially could deliver , or what you might be able to deliver in future - you 've got to deliver it there and then			0
' it did not help that @entity3 lost @entity139 captain and veteran midfielder @entity140 to a shin fracture during a friendly against the @entity143 shortly before the tournament			1
even so , @entity103 's rebuke of the younger players was revealing			2
decline : no @entity18 club have won the @entity20 since @entity148 's @entity21 in 2010 despair : reaching the final of @entity55 inspired hope of a good @entity4 , but the team failed to deliver the fact that @entity111 was in agreement with @entity103 suggested a division existed in the @entity3 camp			1
' i can only underline what @entity103 said , ' @entity111 said			0
' it 's true that we embody the right spirit			0
' it 's also true that we are the ones who always stand up to be counted			0
' anybody who does n't feel like instilling the same effort and anybody who does not share the same passion should just stay at home			0
' the president of the @entity171 , @entity170 , joined the chorus of criticism			0
' from a sporting and football standpoint it has been a failure , ' he said			0
' i 'm disappointed by many things , especially the little quality in our game			2
' there is an alarming statistic which is likely to be addressed when considering the future of the national team and that is the investment in home - grown players			2
back then : @entity3 won the @entity4 in 2006 but have n't reached the knock - out stages since needs to learn : @entity27 told @entity67 he needs to use the @entity4 experience to improve his game in the 2013 - 14 @entity14 campaign , only 42 percent of the players on the pitch were @entity18 and the rest were foreigners			1
' we need to work on the @entity18 movement , ' @entity27 said			2
' we are in a crisis			0
' we only invest in foreign players in the youth teams			0
' what remains unclear is the future of the most talked about and scrutinised player in the national team , @entity67			1
@entity27 not only took the @entity139 striker to @entity59 but started him in all three games			2
@entity67 had a good start by scoring the winning goal against @entity72 but did not make an impact against @entity29 and with @entity3 fighting for their @entity4 lives against @entity30 , @entity27 lost faith in him and replaced him at half - time			1
' i told @entity67 when we said goodbye that if he wants to become the player he thinks he is , he needs to face reality and not live in his virtual world , ' @entity27 said			1
' i told him that he needs to learn from this experience because the national team needs him			2

@entity3 went out in group stages for second *consecutive* @entity4
@entity33 calls for change to national game
older players blame ' immature ' *youngsters*
@entity27 resigned after exit and told @entity67 he needs to start performing
