all things being equal @entity1 should be on the @entity3 podium at the end of the year			2
he made a huge contribution to @entity6 winning the @entity7 and then played a massive part in @entity9 reaching the @entity11 final			1
for inspiring success with both club and country he is out on his own			0
he does n’t have the huge publicity machines behind him that other candidates have , he is not adored the world over and as far as poster - boy looks go , he ’s more hall of mirrors than hall of fame			2
that in part is why @entity6 are happy to let him go			2
the image just is n’t there ; the football most definitely is			0
@entity35 , who only cares about football and is not the slightest bit interested in image , wants to keep @entity1			0
he helped reinvent him last season just to keep him in the side			2
last summer @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity16 were set to play behind @entity43 in a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 with @entity44 and @entity45 in midfield			1
world class : @entity20 target @entity1 had a superb tournament in @entity50 with @entity9 please do n't go : @entity6 boss @entity35 is a massive fan of @entity1 but could lose him to @entity20 when @entity41 missed much of the start of the campaign @entity1 was able to continue playing wide , but when @entity41 returned he was dropped undeservedly , booed by a mindless minority who just wanted to see the expensive new signing , and in one match responded to being taken off by grabbing his crotch for the cameras as he walked off as if to say : ‘ that ’s what i think of that ’			1
@entity35 kept the faith because he knew the assists , the goals and the incredible stamina would be invaluable as @entity6 tried to win the @entity65			0
as @entity9 coach @entity66 said during the last @entity11 : ‘ the longer the game goes on the more he seems to run			1
' @entity35 found a way to play @entity1 by switching to a 4 - 3 - 3 , which did n’t really suit @entity42 , and which was perfect for the @entity71 ’s box - to - box energy			2
there was now no room for him as a winger because of @entity41 ’s arrival on one flank and @entity16 ’s presence on the other but on the left of a midfield three , he was outstanding			0
just not outstanding enough to curb the insatiable thirst for new players and the need for someone big to be sold to fund the latest arrivals			0
tuning up : @entity1 training with @entity6 last week but his days in @entity86 could be numbered the line coming out of @entity6 is that @entity1 wants to go but it ’s more a case of him taking the hint as every year @entity6 buy someone who plays in his position			1
last year it was @entity41 and this year it ’s @entity95			0
he is also depicted as a money grabber who always wants a pay - rise but what he wants is something approaching parity with @entity41 , @entity43 and new man @entity95			0
why should n’t he ask for that after the season he has just had ? instead @entity6 have him on around £ 2.4million take - home pay a year that puts him in the third bracket of their wage structure , behind midfield team - mate @entity45 and a long way from the club ’s top earners			1

room for improvement : @entity20 started the season by losing at home to @entity119 on saturday not since ushering @entity120 towards the exit in 2009 , much to the displeasure of then coach @entity123 , have real been so keen to lose such an important player			1
we all know what happened to @entity120 after he left the @entity127 – three @entity7 finals and one @entity11 final – so maybe @entity20 would be wise to move for @entity120 @entity129 the only lingering question mark would hang over where he might fit into @entity134 ’s 3 - 5 - 2 template at @entity20			1
he could perhaps operate to the right of @entity137 in the five across the middle although that could leave @entity140 and @entity141 contesting the same position			0
he could play in attack or in midfield in a 4 - 3 - 3 but where does @entity140 fit into that system ? @entity1 ’s flexibility would certainly help @entity147 complete the attacking puzzle although one question would still need to be answered : why spend £ 100m on @entity1 when most agree centre back and central midfield are the team ’s real problem positions ? work to do : @entity153 boss @entity134 wants to bolster his squad before the transfer window shuts video @entity20 post-match reaction			1

@entity1 wanted by @entity20 manager @entity158
united ready to invest £ 100m in @entity1 in transfer *fee* plus wages
@entity147 seeking world - class *reinforcements* at @entity153
@entity1 won the @entity7 with @entity6 last season
the @entity9 star also helped his side to the @entity11 final in @entity50
@entity20 lost their @entity172 opener 2 - 1 at home to @entity119
