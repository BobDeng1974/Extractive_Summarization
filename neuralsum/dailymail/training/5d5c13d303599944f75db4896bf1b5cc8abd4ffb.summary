it 's where the future of the @entity3 monarchy is decided , but the finer points of what goes on inside the royal bedroom remain , thankfully , private			1
and yet it has n't always been that way			0
in @entity11 , travelling kings used their mobile royal bedchamber as a meeting place , conducting day - to - day business with courtiers on their bed			1
moreover , kings and queens would sleep separately , meeting only for conjugal visits			2
during the @entity23 and @entity24 periods - from when @entity25 came to the throne in 1485 - the bedroom quickly took over from the battlefield as the stage where the long - term success of the dynasty would be secured : what happened behind closed doors became a matter of intense public scrutiny			1
the bed of @entity35 , @entity36 of @entity37 from 1820 until her death in 1821 the bed of @entity40 of @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 as the second wife of @entity45 and @entity46 from 1685 to 1688 throughout the 17th and 18th centuries the royal bedchamber became a place where aspiring courtiers could gain influence and status : if you were admitted to see the king or queen in their undergarments , you knew you were pretty important			2
now inquisitive historian @entity57 has journeyed into the late night lives of the royal family , peeking behind the bedroom doors of @entity62 kings right through to @entity35 @entity63			1
tales from the @entity65 , screened on @entity66 next week , explores the history of the @entity69 bedroom , its significance , its style , who was allowed into it and what it meant if you were			1
@entity57 visits palaces around @entity3 , from @entity76 to @entity77 on the @entity78 , investigating how the bedrooms of the royal family were regarded throughout history			1
the bed of @entity82 , wife of @entity84 , who died in 1818 at @entity86 during the reign of @entity89 the royal bedchamber became a matter of intense public interest , as the nation became as obsessed as the king was with securing the royal dynasty with a male heir speaking to @entity96 , @entity57 said : ' the royal bedroom used to be a very , very public place			1
it was only with queen @entity63 that the bedroom doors really swung closed , and that was partly to do with her character - she really did n't like the human body very much - and partly to do with the chastity and modesty of the age			0
' until the @entity108 period there were always people trooping through the royal bedroom			2
' speaking about the current royal family , @entity57 said : ' there is still a big overlap between the nation and the monarchy , but they 're not quite the same thing			1
the body of the royal family does n't represent the nation as much as it used to			1
' they keep a big boundary between us and them , and although it sounds surprising given media coverage , they are very private - especially by comparison to the monarchs of the past			0
' describing the wedding night of @entity89 and @entity130 , @entity57 said : ' @entity130 was led from the wedding feast by ladies in waiting , then courtiers de-robed @entity25 in the bedchamber			1
' until the very last minute the room would have been full of people cheering them on			0
then , in the morning , there would have been the " inspection of the sheets " by the ladies of the bedchamber to see if the marriage had been consummated and maybe an heir was on the way			0
' the bed @entity145 commissioned as her death bed , but which was n't ready until after she died historian @entity57 travels into the most intimate rooms used by the royal family to uncover the history of the royal bedroom @entity57 travels through @entity3 visiting royal palaces in search of the history of the royal bedroom she laments the fact that none of @entity89 's bedrooms remained in tact , marvels over the extraordinarily ornate bed commissioned by @entity145 as her deathbed - but , unfortunately , not completed in time - later heralded by @entity84 as ' the most splendid bed in the universe '			1
' when @entity45 's wife @entity40 gave birth to a healthy baby boy in @entity76 in 1688 , the protestants were not happy			0
' @entity45 was catholic and very unpopular , so the new baby meant there was an heir to the throne who would continue his catholic reign			0
' to cause trouble , protestants spread a rumour that @entity40 's baby had died during childbirth , and that an impostor baby had been snuck into the bedroom by a servant who had carried the swapped baby through the palace in a bed - warming pan			0
' they released enormous amounts of detail , including a map of the route the pan had travelled , and although it was , of course , total rubbish , @entity45 was forced to print the accounts of 40 witnesses who had been in the room for the birth : having witnesses was important then , as people needed to be there to check an heir had been born			0
' the thing was @entity45 was so unpopular that people wanted to believe the story , so they did , and eventually they knocked him off the throne			0
' @entity45 lost control of the royal bedroom , and thus lost his kingdom			2
the story reveals the power of what happens in the royal bedroom			2
' @entity57 the documentary pairs up with an exhibition of @entity69 bedrooms currently underway at @entity76			1
secrets of the @entity65 explores the bedchamber of the 17th and 18th century royal court , focusing on six magnificent royal beds , including @entity145 ’s magnificent velvet state bed ; the state bed of @entity45 's @entity35 , @entity40 , where the famous ' warming pan ' incident occurred ; and the ' travelling bed ' of @entity221 , which comes apart into 54 pieces and is testament to a time when the @entity37 and his court were often on the move			1
a palace spokesman said : ' for the first time ever the world ’s largest and rarest collection of early state beds will be presented in one dramatic display which tells the story of how and why the bedchamber became the most public and important destination in the @entity86			2
' the exhibition will also offer a chance to view architect @entity238 's @entity240 ’s @entity239 - opened for the first time in 20 years			0
' through the stories of their royal owners and servants , visitors will be able to explore the elaborate , sometimes bizarre bedchamber rituals , unusual sleeping arrangements and enjoy the luxurious excesses of the @entity24 and @entity250 courts			2
' @entity253 ' exhibition curator , @entity252 , said : ' visitors to the exhibition will discover that , far from being restful places of privacy , the state bedchamber was the seat of power - the equivalent of the modern day boardroom , from which the business of the @entity264 was conducted			0
' events which took place in and around these beds had enormous consequences for society , politics and history			0
' courtiers were knighted , wars were brokered , marriages consummated and mistresses wooed all in the shadow of the royal bed			0
these are extraordinary beds - but not as we know them today			0
' watch tales from the @entity65 on monday at 9pm on @entity66 visit the @entity283 exhibition at @entity76 until november			1
