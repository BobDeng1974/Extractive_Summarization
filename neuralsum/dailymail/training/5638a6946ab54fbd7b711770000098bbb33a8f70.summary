by @entity0 published : 04:01 est , 16 may 2012 updated : 04:23 est , 16 may 2012 on @entity2 , solar power has had a slow start , thanks to high prices and inefficient panels - but the first tests on ' solar satellites ' offer hope of ' green energy ' that actually works.researchers at @entity11 have already tested equipment in space , a first step for solar panels to collect energy and transfer it back to earth through microwaves or lasers			1
the researchers aim to produce a ' swarm ' of satellites that could one day power whole cities			1
initially , the tiny satellites would n't replace ordinary power grids - instead , they could swiftly resupply power to disaster areas or outlying districts that are difficult to reach solar satellite : the researchers aim to produce a ' swarm ' of satellites that could one day power whole cities dr @entity35 , of @entity36 , is leading the research initially the tiny satellites would n't replace ordinary power grids - instead , they could swiftly resupply power to disaster areas or outlying districts that are difficult to reach			1
a ' receiver ' on @entity2 would turn the precisely targeted microwave or laser beams into usable electricity			2
the idea of solar panels in space has been much discussed - but the new research proves that at least a small - scale version is possible			1
dr @entity35 , of the @entity48 ’s @entity36 , who is leading the space based solar power research , said : ‘ space provides a fantastic source for collecting solar power and we have the advantage of being able to gather it regardless of the time of the day or indeed the weather conditions			2
‘ in areas like the @entity61 desert where quality solar power can be captured , it becomes very difficult to transport this energy to areas where it can be used			1
' however , our research is focusing on how we can remove this obstacle and use space based solar power to target difficult to reach areas			1
' this would provide a reliable , quality source of energy and would remove the need for storing energy coming from renewable sources on ground as it would provide a constant delivery of solar energy			2
‘ initially , smaller satellites will be able to generate enough energy for a small village but we have the aim , and indeed the technology available , to one day put a large enough structure in space that could gather energy that would be capable of powering a large city			1
’ last month , a team of science and engineering students at @entity48 developed an innovative ‘ space web ’ experiment which was carried on a rocket from the @entity94 to the edge of space			0
the researchers already deployed a network of satellites which could be used to ' beam ' power back to @entity2 the experiment , known as @entity104 – or ‘ twisting ’ in @entity105 , was an important step forward in space construction design and demonstrated that larger structures could be built on top of a light - weight spinning web , paving the way for the next stage in the solar power @entity113 added : ‘ the success of @entity104 allows us to move forward with the next stage of our project which involves looking at the reflectors needed to collect the solar power			1
‘ the current project , called @entity121 ( @entity123 - inflating @entity122 ) will test the deployment of an ultra light cellular structure that can change shape once deployed			0
the structure is made of cells that are self - inflating in vacuum and can change their volume independently through nanopumps			0
‘ the structure replicates the natural cellular structure that exists in all living things			0
the independent control of the cells would allow us to morph the structure into a solar concentrator to collect the sunlight and project it on solar arrays			0
the same structure can be used to build large space systems by assembling thousands of small individual units			0
’ the project is part of a @entity150 ( @entity151 ) study led by dr @entity153 of @entity154			0
the @entity48 represents the @entity156 section of an international consortium involving @entity159 researchers , and a @entity161 team , led by professor @entity162 of the @entity163 , a world leader in wireless power @entity151 study is demonstrating a new conceptual design for large scale solar power satellites			2
the role of the team at the @entity48 is to develop innovative solutions for the structural elements and new solutions for orbit and orbit control .			0

*floating* solar panels ' beam ' energy to @entity2 using lasers or microwaves
equipment tested in space to deploy ' swarm ' of solar panels
initially will supply power to disaster areas or outlying regions
eventually ' swarm ' of tiny satellites could power cities
