the timber - framed home in @entity9 , @entity10 , contains a number of ' zero - carbon features ' , including solar electric energy , triple glazing and rainwater storage			1
it is entirely heated by underground water - filled tubes that are warmed by solar energy from rooftop panels			1
the @entity2 's first fully solar - powered home has gone on sale - but it will set you back £ 1.2million			2
the timber - framed home in @entity9 , @entity10 , pictured , has a number of ' zero - carbon features ' , including solar electric energy , triple glazing and rainwater storage the five - bedroom house , pictured , was designed and built by @entity29 and comes with two acres of land			1
it is entirely heated by underground water - filled tubes that are warmed by solar energy from rooftop panels the government has set a target for all new homes to be zero - carbon by 2016			1
zero - carbon , also known as carbon neutral , applies to materials and processes where the amount of carbon footprint that is created is offset by the energy produced			1
for example , although solar panels use carbon - based energy to be built , constructed and shipped , they offset this by using solar - based energy to power household and other items			1
buried pipes heat the earth beneath the foundations during the summer and the ground retains the heat in winter , warming the house			2
the five - bedroom house was designed and built by @entity29 and comes with two acres of land			1
director @entity61 said : ' the design and construction , down to the materials , were used specifically for their low footprint			0
' the government has set a target for all new homes to be zero - carbon by 2016			2
' we want to prove @entity67 targets are achievable and genuine zero - carbon homes are a viable investment for @entity2 house builders , ' said mr @entity61			1
' the solar house shows how existing technologies can be used for a large family home but we plan to offer solutions for all house sizes			2
' dr @entity81 , expert in building engineering physics at @entity83 , has been working with the developer to study the rate at which the earth will lose heat over the winter			0
the solar panels on the roof of the house , pictured , are called hybrids because they collect both electrical and thermal energy			1
solar walls preheat incoming ventilation air , and an @entity97 ( @entity98 ) and heat pump can store heart , and retrieve it for use when temperatures drop all the technologies are controlled by a control system , which monitors the inside and outside temperatures , how much energy is being captured by the solar panels , and the heat levels			0
the south - facing triple - glazed windows , pictured , are said to also enhance the house 's energy management during the winter he said : ' the earth 's low conductivity means it should retain the heat rather well			1
' we will have a better idea next spring , but we estimate there 's going to be more heat than you 'll need			0
we do n't know how much , though			0

due to its low energy design , the @entity132 is expected to only require heat from the @entity98 for about 10 weeks of the year			0
for £ 1.2million , buyers also get two garages , pictured all the technologies are controlled by a control system , which monitors the inside and outside temperatures , how much energy is being captured by the solar panels , and the heat levels in the @entity98 and domestic hot water tank			2

estate agent @entity145 said the possibility of no utility bills was a big draw for potential owners : ' the idea is your bills pretty much disappear and the house is self - sustaining and self - sufficient			0
that was a big aspect for most of the people who came to have a look around			0
' we had a lot of interest on the open day			0
there were some strong considerations to buy there and then			0
everyone was very keen to learn how the house worked			0

timber - framed *eco* home situated on two acres of land in @entity10
it has hybrid panels on the roof that collect *sun* and thermal energy
this energy is used to warm up water and heating tubes beneath the house
other zero - carbon features include triple - glazed windows and rain tanks
