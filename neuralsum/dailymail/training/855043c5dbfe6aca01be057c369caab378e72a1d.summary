@entity1 troops may have to return to @entity2 to fight @entity4 fanatics and the @entity1 will have to accept a ‘ willingness to take casualties ’ , @entity7 warns today			1
the former prime minister calls for boots on the ground to take the fight to @entity12 ( is ) terrorists who have seized control of large swathes of @entity2 and @entity16			1
in a 6,500 - word essay on his website , mr @entity7 acknowledges that there is ‘ no appetite ’ among the public for sending @entity1 troops back to @entity2 following his own military forays in the region			1
‘ because the enemy we ’re fighting is fanatical , because they are prepared both to kill and to die there is no solution that does n’t involve force applied with a willingness to take casualties in carrying the fight through to the end , ’ mr @entity7 says			1
@entity42 is due to discuss plans for @entity1 air strikes with @entity46 president @entity45 in @entity47 tomorrow			1
but the prime minister has all but ruled out committing @entity1 troops			1
government sources say the possibility of a recall of @entity52 this week has not been ruled out to seek approval for a bombing campaign expected to begin soon			2
@entity55 signalled yesterday that @entity56 could back air strikes on @entity2 , provided the mission had ‘ clear objectives ’ and a ‘ base in international law ’			1
mr @entity7 welcomes the apparent willingness of regional powers to take the fight to @entity28 , but says @entity30 troops may also be needed , and warns that air strikes will not be enough to defeat the extremists			1
a member loyal to the @entity69 waves an @entity69 flag in in the strong - hold city of @entity73 @entity69 released a video of @entity1 journalist @entity75 following the murder of fellow captive @entity77			1
@entity1 aid worker @entity31 has also been threatened ‘ air power is a major component of this , ’ he says			1
‘ but – and this is the hard truth – air power alone will not suffice			2
they can be hemmed in , harried and to a degree contained by air power			2
but they ca n’t be defeated by it			2
‘ if possible , others closer to the field of battle , with a more immediate interest , can be given the weapons and training to carry the fight – and in some cases , that will work			0
it may work in the case of @entity28			0
‘ i accept fully there is no appetite for ground engagement in the @entity103			2
but we should not rule it out in the future if it is absolutely necessary			0
provided that there is the consent of the population directly threatened and with the broadest achievable alliance , we have , on occasions , to play our part			0
we ’re not talking about armies of occupation			0
we are , in certain situations where it is necessary and subject to all proper limitations , talking about committing ground forces , especially those with special capabilities			0
’ he warns that the roots of @entity28 go deep into @entity128 society , parts of which have an ‘ innately hostile ’ view of the @entity103 , and says the extent of extremist teaching in the @entity1 and elsewhere is ‘ much more frightening than you would think ’			1
he adds : ‘ the problem is not that we ’re facing a fringe of crazy people , a sort of weird cult confined to a few fanatics			2
if it was , we could probably root it out , kill or imprison its leaders , deter its followers and close the doors to new recruits			0
‘ the problem is that we ’re facing a spectrum of opinion based on a world view which stretches far further into parts of @entity128 society			0
’ selfless : @entity31 helps at a refugee camp before he was abducted whilst delivering aid last december @entity1 hostage @entity31 ’s wife has begged @entity12 jihadists to ‘ see it in their hearts ’ to release him			1
@entity157 said the 47 - year - old taxi driver from @entity159 had been delivering aid to @entity16 children in an act of ‘ sheer compassion ’ when he was abducted last december			0

‘ when he was taken he was driving an ambulance full of food and water			0
‘ i can not see how it could assist any state ’s cause to allow the world to see a man like @entity31 dying ... when they hear this message , i implore the people of the @entity12 to see it in their hearts to release my husband			0
’ her heartfelt plea follows dozens of imams and other @entity128 leaders calling for the release of the father of two , described as ‘ a man of peace ’			0
even radicals such as hate preacher @entity196 have spoken out to condemn is for holding mr @entity31			0
but @entity1 firebrand @entity197 yesterday said he had no sympathy for the aid worker because , he claimed , ‘ in the @entity200 it is not allowed for you to feel sorry for @entity202 ’			1
