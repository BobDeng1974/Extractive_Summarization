a teenage boy who lost an arm and a leg as a baby has become the first person in the @entity5 to be fitted with a prosthetic hand that is so advanced it can be controlled via a smartphone app. @entity9 , 16 , is now sporting the i - limb ultra revolution , which can be remotely - controlled and comes complete with an @entity12 app allowing the wearer to control its grip			1
@entity9 can also take advantage of five individually powered digits - including a rotating thumb - on the prosthetic , which is @entity19 firm @entity18 ' most advanced yet			1
the wearer of the i - limb ultra revolution hand can use a smartphone app to choose one of 24 different grips			1
alternatively , the hand can be controlled by muscle signals			2
electrodes in the wrist pick up electrical impulses created by contracting muscles and these are interpreted by a computer in the back of the hand			2
the computer then moves the hand into any one of a series of pre-set patterns			0
doctors were also forced to amputate @entity9 's right leg below the knee , and part of each finger from his right hand			1

the i - limb is so sensitive it can be used to grip a single sheet of paper , play @entity88 or tie shoelaces - but it is also powerful enough to withstand the strain of 90kg weights in the gym			1
the covering can be made to match the wearer 's natural skin tone , but @entity9 chose a jet black version of the i - limb , which costs from £ 25,000 to upwards of £ 80,000 , depending on how far up the arm it needs to extend			1
' i have only had it for 24 hours and it 's not so much that it allows me to do new things but it will allow me to do things more smoothly and naturally , ' @entity9 said			2
' the movement runs much more smoothly			0
i have been practising playing @entity88 with it			0
' there are custom grips i can choose so if i have a certain tennis racquet or cricket bat i could choose a grip for it to fit it perfectly and it will remember that			0
' i also use it in the gym , on the rowing machine and using weights and pulleys , ' he said			0
the advanced prosthetic uses muscle signals to shift into a series of pre-set patterns			2
it achieves this by using electrodes in the wrist to pick up electrical impulses created by contracting muscles , which are interpreted by a computer in the back of the hand			0
