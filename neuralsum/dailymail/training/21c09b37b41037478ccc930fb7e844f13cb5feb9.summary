by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity4 and @entity5 target @entity2 admits he would not be able to resist a move to one of @entity9 's biggest clubs , but insisted he has not yet done a deal with either team			1
@entity2 , who starred for @entity12 during their run to the @entity15 semi-final , is a target for both @entity18 and @entity19 , and the 24 - year - old told @entity21 that he would be excited by the prospect of joining either			1
but the @entity24 midfielder also claimed he was happy in @entity12 , and that he is unsure that the physicality of the @entity26 would suit him			1
wanted man : blind ( right ) is a transfer target for both @entity4 and @entity5 @entity31 quality : the @entity24 midfielder scored against hosts @entity33 in the @entity15 third place play - off ' it would be very hard to turn down these kind of clubs , ' said @entity2			1
' but there 's no serious interest as of yet			2
' you can never make promises in football			0
when you make a promise , you have to stick to it			0
there are plenty of players who promise to stay and then leave after all			0
i am keeping my options open			0
i am very happy in @entity51 and at @entity24 , but you never know what could happen			2
' @entity2 played all of @entity12 's seven @entity15 games under @entity56 , scoring in the third place play - off , but expressed a preference to go to @entity59 rather than follow his international boss to the @entity26			1
physical challenge : @entity2 admitted that he would prefer @entity62 to @entity63 , which does not suit his game ' @entity62 would suit my style of play			1
perhaps @entity63 as well , but that 's a very physical competition and that 's not my biggest strength			2
i have made steps forward physically , but fighting out personal duels is not my thing			0
i am not like @entity73 , who is very powerful			0

@entity76 midfielder says a move to a *top* club would be hard to turn down
@entity4 and @entity5 both interested in @entity24 midfielder
