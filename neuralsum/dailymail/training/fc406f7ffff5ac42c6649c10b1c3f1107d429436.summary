@entity0 showed up at @entity1 on sunday and looked and sounded like a man with something to prove at the 143rd @entity4 this week			1
one analyst after another has been pouring scorn on his preparations with their thoughts all contributing to a premise previously considered unthinkable : has the fire gone out ? well , the fact he was in town a day earlier than expected might be considered something of an answer in itself			1
woods arrived at almost exactly the same time he did on the saturday before the @entity4 at @entity23 in 2006			1
is he secretly superstitious ? eight years ago he was coming off his first missed halfway cut in a major , at the @entity4 , as he came to terms with losing his father , @entity39			1
we all knew what the response would be by the time he got to @entity23			2
back then , the fire was overpowering , and he duly won it for his dad with one of the great exhibitions of links play of all time , and wept unashamedly on the 18th green			1
it was the start of seven tournament victories in a row			0
he was 30 and appeared invincible			0
now , two - time @entity4 champion @entity57 is so scornful of his chances he says @entity0 is ‘ kidding himself ’ if he thinks he can win			1
@entity0 on the prowl : the 2006 champion laughs with his caddy @entity62 during his practice round on saturday major concern : @entity0 has endured a six - year drought since his last major sir @entity67 is just one of many who wondered why he did not play in this week ’s @entity69 , since he has only played two competitive rounds in four months following his surgery			1
certainly , the idea @entity34 would rush back to play before he was ready , simply to appease a sponsor , as he clearly did at his own tournament in @entity75 two weeks ago where he missed the cut comfortably , would have been ludicrous during his glory years			2
and @entity67 would probably have been taken up on his very reasonable suggestion to play the @entity79 as well			0
so a different @entity34 will undoubtedly be on show this time			0
during those eight years he has been battered by injuries , wounded by divorce , damaged irrevocably by scandal and blessed with two children			0
how could things not be different ? but is there anything wrong in a 38 - year - old easing his way back into competition ? why would n’t @entity34 think long - term after his recent surgery and look on this tournament as the first major of the rest of his life ? comeback : @entity0 spent months on the sideline this year after undergoing back surgery ‘ this is how i used to feel when i played , ’ beamed @entity0 on saturday			1
‘ i had good weeks and bad weeks before my back surgery , but now they are all good			2
and it ’s good to be back here			2
' i remember some of the holes but it ’s much more green this time			0
i have been out here trying to hit the ball again and as the weeks go on , i am only going to get stronger			0
i was at a point where i could not do anything because i could not get out of bed , and now i am completely pain - free			0
’ one thing ’s for sure , and that is he will be given a raucous welcome by the locals , who are thrilled he is beginning his major comeback at the place where he created such indelible memories last time			0
@entity121 is currently in thrall at the prospect of something known as the @entity125 , an amazing show on the city ’s streets that is expected to draw more than a million people next week			0
thousands will flock to @entity23 to see @entity0 , but the game itself , as well as his fans , should welcome him back			1
rather than dwelling on what ’s missing , should n’t we just be glad to see him fit and healthy at this stage and leave the critical analysis for later ? raring to go : @entity34 is determined to put in a good performance at @entity23 after months out through injury @entity34 could not play last week , he said , because he had a vacation pre-planned with his kids			1
are we really going to slaughter him for that ? by pure chance , i was there by the clubhouse when he got his first look at @entity23 last time			2
‘ where ’s the first tee , bud ? ’ he asked , cheerfully			0
so alongside old coach @entity154 and his former caddie @entity155 , my eight - year - old son and i accompanied him to the first tee			1
woods pulled out a three - wood on the opening hole , struck it beautifully — and was dismayed to see it disappear into a fairway bunker			0
the same thing happened at the second hole			0
and so the strategy that would startle everyone at @entity23 that week began to take shape			2
over the parched links , @entity0 would use his driver just once all week			2
on occasion he would be 70 yards behind his playing partners but he was n’t to be moved from his strategy of taking the fairway bunkers out of play			0
it was a stunning demonstration of strength of mind and skill and it earned him a two - stroke triumph on a total of 18 under par. victorious : @entity0 celebrates winning @entity4 at @entity23 in 2006 emotion : @entity0 reacts as he walks off the 18th green in 2006 with his caddie @entity155 write caption here the test might be greener this time but even so , two - time open champion @entity187 , who visited @entity23 recently , sees no reason why the winning score should not be similar			1
‘ normally , if you shoot a 72 - hole score of a few digits under par you wo n’t be far away but that might not be the case here , ’ he said			0
‘ this is one of those majors where you need to make a fast start , because a 73 or 74 will leave you with an awful lot of catching up to do			0
’ two of the favoured names this week are recent winners @entity204 and @entity205 , who have both made their reputations winning on tough courses where the winning score is close to par. if they are to prevail at @entity23 , therefore , it might require a change of modus operandi			1
a good weather week will surely play into the hands of the strong @entity215 contingent			0
down the generations , royal @entity121 has been good to the great @entity215 , with victories for @entity219 and @entity220 , as well as @entity0			2
trouble ahead : the four hardest holes at @entity23 that could decide @entity4 there would probably have been wins for @entity224 and @entity225 as well but for the course ’s 39 - year exile from the @entity4 rota from 1967			1
and still we have n’t mentioned the best player in the world , @entity230			0
is there another sportsman in his position who has perfected the art of staying under the radar quite as well as the gentle @entity238 ? @entity230 has not played since the @entity4 a month ago , but he pulled the same trick before winning the masters last year , so no - one should have too many concerns in terms of rust			1
the last three winners of the @entity245 — @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248 — were all aged 42 or 43 at the time of their wins and it would come as no surprise if the trend continued			0
warming up : the 2013 @entity4 winner @entity204 will fancy his chances at @entity23 focused : @entity256 will be one of the favourites when @entity4 starts on thursday and 41 - year - old @entity258 will be the fervent hope of many			1
at the other end of the career scale , 25 - year - old @entity256 will probably start favourite , and deservedly so after showing at @entity263 — on thursday at least — how much he has learned about links golf			1
but the start of the week , at least , will be dominated by one man who turned up early at @entity23 on sunday , as if to show he means business			2
yes , it ’s true , he ’s not the @entity0 of old			2
but he ’s still @entity0 , and that alone is enough to give this major championship the frisson of anticipation missing from the masters and the @entity4 .			1

the 38 - year - old wept unashamedly at the 18th green following his 2006 win
@entity0 won that major as he came to terms with losing his father , @entity39
he has failed to win a @entity282 event since triumphing at the @entity4 in 2008
an operation on his back kept him out for three months earlier this year
critics have suggested the fire in @entity0 ' game has finally gone out
@entity204 and @entity256 are among favourites to win at @entity23
