the new @entity0 and perfect serum - an updated version of the sell - out 2007 product the original triggered such a frenzy that desperate shoppers were forced to join waiting lists and bottles began changing hands on @entity11 for almost four times the original price			1
so it ’s little surprise that an updated version of the @entity0 and perfect serum – containing a handful of new ingredients – is tipped to become an instant best - seller when it launches tomorrow			1
the cream first caused a stampede at the tills in 2007 after a @entity25 documentary revealed the £ 17 product had been clinically proven to reduce signs of ageing			1
boots is now launching an updated – and more expensive – version with several new ingredients , including @entity32 3000 , which can dramatically increase the amount of collagen in the skin and improve its elasticity			1
and tests on the ‘ advanced ’ serum – carried out at the @entity39 – have shown that the new formula is even more effective than the original			1
boots has been testing the serum on more than 2,600 volunteers , many of whom went without mirrors for a month to help them pinpoint the differences			1
the trial showed that after four weeks , eight out of ten women experienced ‘ significant anti-ageing benefits ’			2
@entity52 , 38 , was one of the women taking part in the trials			0
the mother of four said she was normally ‘ massively cynical ’ about claims made by beauty companies			0
new ingredient @entity73 has been shown to boost collagen levels in skin , increasing its elasticity			0
when combined with another peptide – acetyl dipeptide – it becomes even more effective at reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles			0
the serum also contains a patented cocktail of antioxidants as well as salicylic acid – which helps exfoliate the skin – and @entity89 acid , which is responsible for making the surface of the face appear plumper thanks to its ability to bind water into the skin			2
but she added : ‘ i used this and noticed a difference in the depth of lines and overall smoothness			0
it takes a lot for me to believe things work but i was taken aback			0
’ skin expert professor @entity105 , from @entity39 , said : ‘ boots carried out robust , clinical trials in line with our understanding of skin repair			2
’ and dr @entity113 , a skincare adviser at @entity106 , said : ‘ the identification of anti-ageing solutions has to come from an in - depth understanding of the ageing process			1
‘ this has been the most rigorous and complex product development we have ever undertaken			2
after four weeks more than 85 per cent of users say their fine lines are reduced and their skin looks younger			0
normally it would take at least eight weeks to see this sort of result			0
’ he also explained that testers continued to notice improvements after the initial month was up , saying : ‘ the benefits grow with time			0
' after three months there was a significant improvement to crows ’ feet around the eyes			0
’ the @entity0 and @entity136 serum , which costs £ 23.95 , is designed for people aged between 25 and 35			1
