by @entity0 a ship 's precious cargo of 2,800 bars of silver has finally reached the @entity5 to be made into coins - more than 70 years after it was sunk by a @entity8 u-boat			1
the shipment of silver worth £ 38million was bound for @entity10 at the height of the second world two , but it was lost at sea after the merchant ship was torpedoed			1
the @entity15 was sunk off the @entity17 coast in 1941 carrying solid silver bullion from @entity19 to bolster the @entity10 's dwindling war chest			1
the @entity5 today began striking silver coins from the bullion cargo of the @entity15 to be sold in its memory			1
@entity5 historian dr @entity38 said : ' this shipment of silver bullion should have got here 72 years ago and now it has finally come home			1
' i do n't think anything like this has happened before - bullion destined for us which did n't make now finding it 's way here			0
it 's a very romantic and evocative story			0
' an image of the ship on the bed of the @entity34 , where it has rested for the last 70 years @entity54 , project manager of the rescue operation , which recovered 2,792 silver bars totaling more than 3million troy ounces of silver			1
the haul would be worth around £ 38,272,000 at today 's prices a @entity8 u-boat like that pictured sunk the merchant ship after it left its naval convoy in bad weather in december 1940 , the @entity5 was running dangerously low in stocks of silver due to the war and called in emergency supplies from @entity19			1
a large shipment of silver was sent from @entity71 aboard the @entity10 merchant ship @entity15 - which sailed under the protection of a naval convoy			1
second officer @entity75 was the sole survivor of the sinking of the @entity15 but after battling a heavy storm it began running short of coal off the coast of @entity81 and was forced to break free and head for the safety of @entity84			0
the slow merchant ship was spotted by a @entity8 u-boat patrolling the @entity10 waters and was torpedoed at 12.08am on 17 february 1941			1
the stricken ship sank within 20 minutes - 300 miles off the south west coast of @entity81			2
three lifeboats were launched but only second officer @entity75 made it to land and survived to report what had happened			0
his lifeboat started with 31 men but after spending 13 days at sea he was the only sailor to make it to dry land alive			0
he was awarded an mbe in recognition of his heroic efforts to keep fellow survivors alive , as well as a @entity102 for bravery at sea , and amazingly returned to sea nine months later			0
the 412ft ship was eventually found sitting on the seabed 300 miles off the @entity17 coast in september 2011 by @entity109 marine exploration company @entity108			2
and after a five - year rescue operation on behalf of the @entity112 they recovered the silver bullion from @entity15 at an astonishing depth of three miles			2
half a mile deeper than the @entity116 - it is the largest and deepest recovery of precious metal from a shipwreck in maritime history			2
@entity54 , who project managed the five - year rescue operation , said : ' nobody has ever done anything like this before at this depth			0
the @entity15 was eventually found on the seabed in september 2011 by @entity109 marine exploration company @entity108 a remotely - operated submarine took three and a half hours to get down to the sea bed to view the sunken ship ' there were so many unknowns and when you took a step back it looked incredibly daunting - but we just took each challenge as it came			2
' finally bringing the silver bullion back to the @entity5 , 72 years after it should have arrived , will bring the incredible story of the ship and its crew to light			1
the @entity143 helped raise funds for the @entity146 war effort , sending £ 23.3 million in gifts and £ 10.7 million in interest - free loans			1
@entity19 also paid for its two and a half million citizens who joined the armed forces and the @entity151 went on to fight in the @entity152 against the @entity153 and then in @entity154 against the @entity8			2
even the 250,000 @entity156 people in southern @entity157 sent £ 10,400 to purchase two spitfires for the @entity159 and paid extra taxes so their government could send £ 50,000 as a gift to @entity10			0
' not many people have heard about the @entity15 since it sank but now it will be one of the most famous wrecks to be worked on and those sailors will never be forgotten			0
' the rescue operation recovered 2,792 silver bars totaling approximately 3.2 million troy ounces of silver - worth around £ 38,272,000 at current prices			2
mr @entity54 said the record - breaking depth of the salvage operation left them with unique challenges to overcome and some eye - watering operational costs			1
he said : ' for the final stage of the project to retrieve the silver bullion we chartered a boat at a cost of £ 100,000 - a - day - and were there for two seasons for around 180 days			0
' it took three and a half hours to send out remotely operated submersible down to the sea bed and then we had to work our way through the boat to find where the silver was stored			0
' up until the last 10 years the technology has n't been there to do anything like this			0
at one point in the salvage operation , a £ 100,000 - a - day specialist boat needed to be chartered while the silver was from brought up from the depths mr @entity54 spearheaded the operation to recover the silver from a depth of three miles ' but after silver prices rocketed it became financially worthwhile to give it a go and we believed we had the technology and skill to do it			1
' this has been a great challenge for us but now we know we can work any depth of water			0
' coming to the @entity5 and seeing the silver bullion coins struck was quite emotional - now after 72 years we have seen the story come full circle			1
' @entity108 kept 80 per cent of the silver bullion they recovered and the @entity112 were given 20 per cent			0
some of this bullion has now been passed to the @entity5 for the striking of the 99.9 pure 1/4oz silver britannia bullion coins			1
each of the 20,000 solid silver coins will be edged with the name @entity15 and available to purchase in the @entity10 for the first time at the end of the month			0
he said : ' not many people have heard about the @entity15 since it sank but now it will be one of the most famous wrecks to be worked on and those sailors will never be forgotten ' the coins made from the silver recovered will be edged with the name @entity15 and will go on sale at the end of the month			0

merchant ship carrying silver from @entity19 for the war effort was sunk in 1941
its cargo of 2,800 bars of silver has sat on the bed of the @entity34 ever since
record - breaking bid to salvage the silver from three miles down a *success*
the @entity5 is now making the metal into coins to remember the *tragedy*
