a panel including director of national intelligence @entity9 and @entity12 chief general @entity11 told a @entity14 hearing that @entity1 foreign surveillance programs are run responsibly			1

protestors waving placards and wearing clown glasses with ' @entity27 ' regularly interrupted the hearing			0
scroll down for @entity29 protests : @entity12 chief general @entity11 glares at a protestor who interrupts the hearing waving a protest placard and wearing glasses carrying the slogan ' stop spying on us ' gen. @entity11 said he would rather take his lumps with the public and the press than stop a program that protects @entity1 from future terror attacks three - ring circus : during a hearing on potential changes to the @entity48 , @entity45 protesters stole the show until they were shown the door showdown : ( @entity52 ) @entity12 deputy director @entity53 , @entity12 director gen. @entity11 , @entity54 @entity9 and deputy ag @entity55 defended @entity1 intelligence operations in the face of new allegations from overseas separately , federal lawmakers are poised to dramatically restrict how the agency can use its vast databases of communications records that span both the nation and the world following the leaks from @entity67			1
the panel faced questions against a backdrop of new charges regarding @entity1 spying on foreign leaders of friendly nations			1
@entity75 , a @entity77 @entity76 , said early on in the hearing that his committee was generally aware of the intelligence community 's overseas activities , but stopped short of offering specifics about spying on foreign heads of state			1
@entity9 acknowledged that if the @entity12 were surveilling foreign leaders , ' that should be reported to the committee ... in considerable detail ' as a ' significant ' intelligence activity over which @entity89 has oversight '			1
silenced : a protester is escorted from the hearing room by police defiant : an anti-spying activist gives a peace sign as he is escorted from the hearing placards : @entity1 director of national intelligence @entity9 is pictured as protesters call for an end to alleged @entity1 spying practices @entity103 message : anti-spying protestors wearing some eye - catching clothing tried their best to disrupt the hearing whenever possible he added that ' we do only what the policymakers , writ large , have actually asked us to do			1
' @entity75 put down a marker as the hearing began by insisting that @entity1 spying programs are saddled with an unusual ' level of oversight , our commitment to privacy protections , and our checks and balances on intelligence collection			2
' the hearing focused on proposed changes to the @entity48 , a law that governs the procedures that government agencies must follow before they can tap foreign phone lines or otherwise snoop on foreigners ' communications , usually in the name of thwarting terror attacks			2
' @entity132 does not ask a @entity48 court for a warrant to listen to a phone call on their state - owned and censored network , ' @entity75 said			0
' the @entity138 does not conduct oversight on the @entity140			0
but @entity1 has those checks ; @entity1 has those balances			0
' under fire : @entity144 of @entity45 protests as director of the @entity12 general @entity11 appears to wipe his brow before the hearing under scrutiny : protestors could be seen in the background while @entity11 answered questions during the hearing when @entity89 restricts the intelligence community 's activities , @entity9 said , ' we are incurring greater risks ' from foreign adversaries			1
gen. @entity11 dispensed with his prepared statement and spoke ' from the heart , ' saying that his agency would rather ' take the beatings ' from reporters ' than ... give up a program ' that would prevent a future attack on the nation			1
protester @entity166 with the @entity45 pressure group was reportedly arrested after he and other activists distracted members of @entity89 with clown - like getups demanding an end to domestic and foreign spying programs @entity173 , @entity23 and @entity174 have complained that the @entity12 has engaged in snooping that goes far beyond traditional spycraft , aided by new technologies and permissive @entity1 policies			1
a senior @entity180 official told the @entity182 news agency on tuesday that @entity183 urgently needed to rebuild trust with @entity185 , threatening a stop to transatlantic trade talks and other initiatives			0
@entity189 , vice president of the @entity190 and @entity180 justice commissioner , said @entity185 's relationships with @entity1 were ' shaken and damaged ' by accusations that the @entity1 had spied on a cell phone belonging to @entity23 chancellor @entity22 for as many as 11 years			0
@entity185 , she said , are increasingly feeling like they ' are not seen as partners , but as a threat			0
' @entity199 sen. @entity198 and @entity201 rep. @entity200 , the bipartisan pair who co-wrote the @entity204 , have called for a new legislative approach to authorizing domestic spying			0
' [ @entity208 ] he dragnet collection of millions of @entity1 ’ phone records every day — whether they have any connection at all to terrorism — goes far beyond what @entity89 envisioned or intended to authorize , ' they wrote in an op - ed in @entity215			2
' more important , we agree it must stop			0
' ' it is not enough to just make minor tweaks around the edges			0
it is time for real , substantive reform			0
' their bill , the @entity225 , proposes to put an end to an @entity12 program of wholesale collection of domestic phone records , including the dates , times and phone numbers of tens of millions of calls			2
the bill would also forbid the @entity12 from trolling its databases of overseas communications records in search of information that could identify @entity1 citizens , including those who may be involved in terror plots against the @entity1 homeland			1
such restrictions on @entity1 intelligence gathering would have been unheard of only a few years ago , but twelve years after the 9/11 terror attacks the environment in @entity183 is different			2
director of national intelligence @entity9 testified that changes to the @entity48 law would curtail the @entity12 's ability to protect @entity1 from future terror attacks ' all nations do it ' : director of national intelligence @entity9 gestures as he defends @entity1 spying on foreign allies pause for thought : @entity255 looks deep in thought during the hearing in which he acknowledged that any monitoring of foreign allies should be disclosed to the hearing and the revelations from fugitive whistle - blower @entity67 has lit a fire under the @entity1 intelligence apparatus , forcing its leaders to defend their practices			1
@entity9 and @entity11 joined @entity12 deputy director @entity266 and deputy attorney general @entity55 in tuesday 's hearing , opposing new curbs on their broad powers to sniff out lawbreakers through advanced electronic eavesdropping			1
president @entity272 said he is instituting a complete review of @entity1 intelligence procedures in the wake of stinging allegations that the @entity12 has been peeping on foreign leaders through their phones and email accounts but the new legislation could be mooted if the @entity17 were to reverse course and order the @entity12 to stand down through an executive order			1
the @entity283 reported on tuesday that president @entity272 is considering issuing such a directive , specifically in response to the uproar over charges that the @entity12 had spied on @entity22 's cell phone			2
and @entity290 cited an unnamed @entity1 official on tuesday in reporting that @entity272 has ordered the @entity12 to ' curtail eavesdropping on the @entity294 headquarters ' in @entity295			2
@entity272 said monday during a television interview on the new @entity297 that his administration is conducting ' a complete review of how our intelligence operates outside the country			0
' noting the explosion of new technologies whose use by intelligence agencies can spiral out of control , he said he was ' initiating now a review to make sure that what they 're able to do does n't necessarily mean what they should be doing			2
' house speaker @entity314 said that a top - to - bottom review of @entity1 intelligence programs was warranted , given the need to temper aggressive information - gathering with the need to respect civil liberties and @entity1 ' rights under the @entity1 @entity322			0
' we have to find the right balance here , ' he said			0
' and clearly , we 're imbalanced			0
' anger : @entity23 is still smarting from the revelations that chancellor @entity22 's phone was monitored from 2002			0

' we do only what the policymakers , writ large , have actually asked us to do , ' says director of national intelligence @entity9
@entity17 intel committee chairman hints that @entity89 was *notified* about every foreign spying program
if the @entity12 were tapping foreign leaders ' phones , @entity9 said , ' that should be reported to the committee ... in considerable detail '
@entity272 may order the intelligence community to stop snooping on foreigners
new legislation would *hamstring* intelligence agencies , forbidding them from connecting the dots in their databases to snare @entity1 citizens
@entity12 chief gen. @entity11 said he would rather ' take the beatings ' from reporters than ' give up a program ' that protects @entity1
