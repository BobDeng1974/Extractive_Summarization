by @entity0 ordinarily , the @entity1 would have presided over the 10.30am service yesterday at @entity3			1
the gathering at the modern pebble - dashed church outside @entity7 , @entity8 , lasts an hour and is followed by tea and biscuits			2
but having been caught buying and using illegal drugs including crystal meth , crack cocaine and ketamine , it would hardly have seemed appropriate to take the pulpit			1
@entity1 is being investigated by the police after being caught on film apparently buying hard drugs , including crack cocaine and crystal meth ridicule : the @entity23 during the @entity25 hearing the @entity26 appears to agree – @entity1 has been suspended from his duties for three weeks			1
he has been one of its ministers for 40 years			2
laudable , you might say			2
but does being in such a post really make one a suitable candidate to become chairman of the @entity34 ? was there something else in @entity1 ’s cv that qualified him for this most demanding of positions ? well , to be fair , the openly gay @entity1 did work for @entity40 for four years , in the late 60s			1
the position he held is not clear , but given the fact that he was 19 at the time and became a @entity26 minister at the end of his tenure suggests the post was not a senior one			1
at a meeting of the @entity25 earlier this month , when asked to explain how he was qualified to run the bank following its £ 700million loss he replied : ‘ i took the exam of the @entity50			1
‘ i completed part one and the best part of part two of those exams before i became a @entity26 minister			1
‘ i would judge that experience is out of date in terms of the needs of contemporary banking			2
’ who would argue with that ? especially given his somewhat shaky grasp of figures			2
he told the committee that the co-op ’s balance sheet had £ 3billion of assets , when the answer was in fact £ 47billion			2
he was also at a loss to answer questions about the amount of loans on its books			2
perhaps there is some other evidence of financial wizardry , then , in his background ? yesterday the @entity85 searched long and hard , but could find nothing			2
@entity1 was born in @entity87 to parents @entity88 and @entity90 but has lived in the @entity91 for many years			1
his father died in 1993 aged 70 , and he had a brother , @entity93 , who died the same year aged just 39			0
he lives in a modest house in @entity7 and shared it with his mother until her death last year aged 85			0
mr @entity1 lives in a modest house in @entity7 and shared it with his mother until her death last year aged 85 after that brief stint with the @entity40 , he became a minister with the @entity26 , for whom he now sits as a trustee on the body that manages its invested funds and property			1
twenty or so years ago , @entity1 came to attention as vice-chairman of @entity111 ’s social services committee during the ‘ satanic abuse ’ fiasco between 1988 and 1991			1
it involved social workers making lurid claims about satanic rituals being performed on children and , as a result , 20 children from six families were placed in care			0
however , the police found no evidence and a government - backed inquiry subsequently blamed ‘ evangelical @entity127 ’ for the scare			1
flowers maintained a high profile , sitting on committees and getting himself involved in community projects			0
ironically , given recent events , from 1992 to 2004 he was prominently involved with the @entity135 , which helps drug abusers			1
today he remains a trustee of the @entity138 , the hiv / aids charity			0
speaking about his involvement with the charity , he once said : ‘ as an out gay man for all of my adult life i am acutely aware of the issues surrounding @entity145			0
‘ like many others i have been personally affected by it in ways which are often far too painful to recount			0
’ @entity1 was a councillor at @entity149 for ten years but does not appear to have been universally popular			1
one former councillor told the @entity85 yesterday : ‘ @entity1 was an insufferable and pompous man who threw his not inconsiderable weight around			1
' he always made it plain he was the most educated person in a room and everyone else was a peasant			0
’ in 2010 – more irony – he was appointed by @entity159 leader @entity158 to the party ’s finance and industry board			0
none of this goes any way to explain just how @entity1 became chairman of the proudly ethical @entity34			1
but it seems the system by which the appointment was made goes some way to solving the mystery			0
flowers rose through the co-op ’s ranks , joining the board of the @entity176 in 2008 and becoming deputy chairman			0
in 2009 the post of chairman of @entity180 became vacant			0
choosing the candidate fell to the 13 - strong remuneration and @entity183 , which is formed largely of former @entity159 politicians and co-operative movement veterans			0
it traditionally selected directors from the board of the @entity176			0
on that board of about 20 people , you would be unlikely to find any high - flying bankers			0
or anyone , it seems , remotely up to the job of running a bank			1
the school leaver who worked at @entity40 40 years previously was the best they could find .			0
