the orchid is one of the most unique and instantly recognisable flowers in the world			0
it has evolved a so - called lip - a large and irregular modified petal , to attract insects - but the driving force behind this unusual shape was not known , until now			1
researchers have found that its shape is determined by two competing groups of proteins and by tweaking them , they can convert this lip into a standard petal			1
the orchid ( an example of which is pictured ) has evolved a so - called lip - a large and irregular modified petal , to attract insects - but the driving force behind this unusual shape was not known , until now the study , published in the journal @entity23 , extends scientists ' understanding of the mechanisms leading to the diverse beauty of orchid flowers			1
there are between 21,950 and 26,049 accepted species of @entity31 , most of which have a large and irregular modified petal , called the lip , in addition to three ' normal ' petals			1
the structure of orchids is unique among floral plants			0
they also have three sepals , which sometimes look like other petals , and a single column at the centre which is used during reproduction			0
researchers have found its shape is determined by two competing groups of proteins			1
they converted lips into petals in two orchid species by reducing the activity of the l complex using gene silencing ( illustrated ) conversion of lips into sepal / petal - like structures in @entity60 and @entity61 orchids is shown orchids have three sepals , which sometimes look like other petals , and a single column at the centre			1
lips attract insect pollinators and serve as a landing platform for them , which is thought to have given orchids an evolutionary advantage over other flowers , by promoting reproduction			0
to discover why the flowers developed their distinctive lips , researchers from @entity74 in @entity75 studied the expression of a class of genes known to be associated with petal development			1
they found that in mature orchid flowers , the expression pattern suggests two protein complexes , called the ' l ' complex and the ' @entity87 ' complex , compete to promote the formation of the lip and standard petals			1
the have called this mechanism the @entity93 code and discovered that orchid species from many subfamilies with different types of lips and petals all obey it			2
the experts were also able to convert lips into petals in two orchid species by reducing the activity of the l complex using gene silencing			1
lips attract insect pollinators and serve as a landing platform for them , which is thought to have given orchids an evolutionary advantage over other flowers , by promoting reproduction			0
lips are differently coloured , ruffled or pouch - shaped , depending on the species , and can be decorated with horns , hairs , warts , teeth and tails to attract specific pollinators			2
these range from bees to flies , gnats , moths , butterflies , hummingbirds and even bats in some tropical climates			0

they found that in mature orchid flowers , two protein complexes , called the ' @entity168 ( red ) and the ' @entity87 ' complex ( blue ) , compete to form the lip and petals			1
this competition and balancing act is illustrated above the pastel - coloured orchid mantis has fascinated naturalists for more than a century			2
it was popularly thought that the insect , whose legs are flattened and heart - shaped to resemble petals , simply mimics an orchid , allowing it to ' hide ' and catch prey			1
but earlier this year , scientists suggested that the mantis does n't simply blend into flowers , but is attractive to insects in its own right , sometimes preferring to remain more easily visible on leaves			0
it was popularly thought that the orchid mantis ( pictured ) , whose legs are flattened and heart - shaped to resemble petals , simply mimics an orchid , allowing it to ' hide ' and catch prey dr @entity200 of @entity201 , @entity202 , set about systematically testing the ideas contained within the traditional view of the orchid mantis ' modus operandi			2
first , his team tested whether mantises actually camouflage among flowers , or , alternatively , attract insects on their own			1
for a flower - seeking insect , as predicted , the mantis ' colour pattern is indistinguishable from most common flowers			0
however , when paired alongside the most common flower in their habitat , insects approached mantises more often than flowers , showing that mantises are attractive to insects by themselves , rather than simply camouflaging among the flora			0
' we can clearly observe insects , like bees , diverging from their flight paths and flying right towards this deceptive predator , ' dr @entity200 said			0
when paired alongside the most common flower in their habitat , insects approached mantises more often than flowers , showing that mantises are attractive to insects by themselves , rather than simply camouflaging among the flora			0
here , an orchid mantis eats a @entity231 heliconian butterfly in @entity232 they also found that mantises did not choose to hide among the flowers , but selected leaves to sit on , just as often			2
sitting near flowers did bring benefits , though , because insects were attracted to the general vicinity			0
when they compared the mantis 's shape and colour with flowers from an insect 's perspective , the predator did not resemble an orchid or indeed any particular species of flower , but rather a ' generalised ' flower			2
they may exploit a loophole created by evolutionary efficiency savings within the insect brain			0
the compact brains of insects use a rule of thumb - anything matching colour x is a nectar - containing flower – and the predator uses ' sensory exploitation ' to catch its victims			2
sensory exploitation is a concentrated mass of the right colour			0
the insect classifies the mantis as a giant nectar - filled flower and approaches to investigate – to its doom .			0

orchid has evolved a ' lip ' - irregular modified petal - to attract insects
researchers in @entity75 found its shape is determined by two competing groups of proteins - the ' l ' complex and the ' @entity87 ' complex
by tweaking them , they can convert the lip into standard petals again
