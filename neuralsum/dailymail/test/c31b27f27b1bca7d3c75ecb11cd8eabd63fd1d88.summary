@entity0 says ageing is a ' disease that can and should be cured ' with his @entity4 beard and lines etched deep into his forehead , @entity0 looks like a man a lot older than his 51 years			1
a penchant for beer , fried food and an aversion to exercise could fool you into believing the lanky ex-public schoolboy cares little about ageing			1
but you would be wrong			1
for @entity16 , a charismatic @entity17 and @entity19 - educated biomedical theorist , firmly believes there is no reason , with the right ' therapies ' , why any of us should n't reach 500 , 1,000 or even 5,000 years of age			1
it sounds bonkers but @entity16 's theories have gained him some high - profile supporters in @entity31 , the super-rich tech enclave in northern @entity32 that is home to more middle - aged billionaires than anywhere else on the planet			1
@entity37 boss @entity36 ( worth £ 1.5 billion ) donated £ 2.4 million to @entity16 's anti-ageing institute @entity38 ( @entity38 )			1
senescence is scientific jargon for ageing			1
while many academics mock him , in age - obsessed @entity42 now regularly breaks bread and funds his research with donations from some of the sharpest minds in the world , including @entity53 co-founders @entity51 and @entity54 ( who has talked of ' curing death ' ) and @entity57 , of @entity58 , who are all showing an interest in gerontology , or the study of ageing			1
@entity53 's @entity63 , who heads the computer giant 's investment arm , said : ' we have tools in the life sciences to achieve anything you have the audacity to envision			1
i hope to live long enough not to die			2
' one source at a leading software company told @entity75 : ' @entity76 has tapped a rich vein in @entity31			1
he 's become something of a controversial cheerleader for a generation of tech billionaires who have made their fortunes and now , of course , want to live for ever			1
' @entity76 was raised in @entity84 by his artist mother @entity85 , who left him £ 11 million when she died in 2011 – £ 9 million of which he has invested in his company			1
he spent the remainder on a ' very nice house '			2
he never knew his father and became fascinated by seeking a cure for ageing while still at @entity17			1
' i 've been ridiculed but finally people are starting to come round to my way of thinking			2
anyone who has ever wanted to change the world has been attacked			2
@entity102 said first they ignore you , then they ridicule you , then they fight you and then they say , " we were with you all along "			2
' @entity76 's radical thesis is that ageing can be halted and even reversed by treating the human body like a vintage car – ' replace the parts , clean it up , keep it running smoothly way past its expected expiration date '			1
his argument is that cellular decay causes ageing , illness and , ultimately , death , and that technologies being developed now and inventions in the future will allow us to repair and replace damaged body parts at a cellular level – leading to virtual immortality			2
people will still die in accidents and from suicide , ' but there is no reason that someone living today should n't live to 500 , 1,000 years			2
as the technologies improve , lifespans will increase ' , says @entity16			2
he believes the first person who will live to be 1,000 has already been born , and cites research that has dramatically extended the lives of mice , worms and fruit flies as proof science is ' catching up ' with his theories that therapies which will genetically alter , replace and repair the cells in our bodies will be the key to eternal life			1
he accuses the majority of us of being in a ' pro-ageing trance ' , content to accept ageing and death as inevitable , while the reality is that technology will , within two decades , he says , have advanced far enough that we can replace and repair faulty genes , ' clear out the gunk around cells ' and rejuvenate our bodies			2
it sounds fanciful but as he talks , it is clear that @entity16 is empowered by the support of the @entity31 billionaires			1
' it is a good feeling to finally be getting validation , ' he admits			0
many academics have dismissed his theories as pie in the sky			0
it should be noted that much of what he says is theoretical and , critics point out , @entity16 has never actually done any practical lab work			0
@entity76 and his biologist wife @entity183 ( pictured ) have an unconventional marriage and he admits to having ' two younger girlfriends ' @entity186 , director of the @entity187 at the @entity188 , said : ' based on the biology that we know today , somewhere between 100 and 120 there is a roof in play and i challenge if we can get beyond it			0
' the oldest human to date was @entity198 @entity197 , who died in august 1997 at the age of 122 years 164 days			0
@entity76 has been mockingly compared to a ' @entity201 ' figure because of his flowing facial hair , and heads turn in the airport bar as he bangs his glass on the table and loudly pronounces that ' 150,000 people die every day worldwide and of those people , two - thirds die of ageing one way or another			0
that 's 30 @entity213 every day			1
if i bring forward the cure for ageing by one day i 've saved 100,000 lives '			0
he refuses to carry a mobile phone ( ' anti-social , nasty things ' ) and has never learned to drive due to a ' mental block '			0
' cars can kill people without it being the driver 's fault , ' he says			1
he gives interviews to ' spread the word ' and has written several anti-ageing books			0
last year he featured in a critically acclaimed independent movie , the @entity230			0
@entity76 and his biologist wife @entity183 , 19 years his senior , have an unconventional marriage and he cheerfully admits to having ' two younger girlfriends ' , aged 45 and 24			0
is n't juggling the needs of three women enough to age any man prematurely ? he laughs : ' it keeps me busy			0
' critics argue that if he is right and we all live longer , the world 's resources will be stretched by overpopulation , but he hits back by saying : ' @entity246 will adapt			1
people will have fewer children			0
' what about the cost of keeping so many people alive ? ' people will continue to contribute to society because they will be healthier and more productive			0
' when people think about longevity they forget about the health and then they start to think this whole thing is morally questionable			0
it might be technologically fanciful but all we do is medical research			0
i work on stopping people from getting sicker as they get older			0
the by - product of that is longevity			0
' i have no idea if i will live to 100			0
i do know i 'd like to have the chance to live to 100 when i am 99 rather than having that choice removed from me by declining health			0

@entity0 , 51 , believes he will *unlock* *secrets* to huge advances in life
the former @entity17 and @entity19 scholar is a biomedical theorist
he has a *hugely* rich and *influential* following in @entity32 's @entity31
raised in @entity84 , he inherited £ *11million* when his mother passed away
it 's been invested in his *strategies* for @entity38
the eccentric claims : ' aging is a disease that can and should be cured '
