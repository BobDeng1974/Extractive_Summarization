' @entity11 's career began when she was spotted working in a @entity85 milliners shop by early @entity13 artist , @entity86			1
through @entity86 , @entity87 , described as ' a most beautiful creature with an air between dignity and sweetness ' by her future brother - in - law @entity92 , met the remaining @entity13 artists , including @entity31 himself			0
of all the paintings inspired by @entity11 though , the most famous is sir @entity25 - @entity25 ' 1852 work @entity27 , which shows the model as @entity101 's doomed @entity100 princess floating in a river before her death from drowning			1
