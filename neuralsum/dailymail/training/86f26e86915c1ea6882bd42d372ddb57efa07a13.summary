@entity8 ( shown ) is a portable , reusable and eco-friendly coffee cup which can collapse down when empty to fit in handbags , backpacks and even pockets with the average coffee drinker throwing away a total of 500 disposable cups every year , the reusable @entity8 can apparently help to reduce waste			1

it takes apparently as much energy as smashing an egg on a table with your hand to close the cup			0
' when we first came up with the idea we were amazed there were no similar products on the market , ' said @entity33 , a management consultant from @entity55			1
' @entity8 is reminiscent of disposable coffee cups , but upgraded for a more robust and modern aesthetic			1
' we strove to create an iconic look that city commuters , busy parents and students alike would be proud to own and display			0
' it takes years of effort to develop a product and there was so much self - doubt , and so many little hurdles that popped up during the process			2
' but whenever we took a step back and had a look at the @entity8 with fresh eyes , we always felt we had a winner			2
' this kept us pushing ahead - one step at a time			0

scientists claim that a ‘ green ’ biofuel made from waste coffee grounds could power vehicles on our roads			0
around 22 pounds ( 10 kilograms ) of leftover grounds , generated by the average coffee shop , produces around two litres of the biofuel			0
the scientists believe that if this were scaled up nationally , popular high street coffee shops such as @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 could soon be rivalling oil giants like @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121			0
researchers at the @entity123 said such waste coffee grounds could be a sustainable fuel source for powering vehicles			0
he set a goal of raising £ 6,000 ( $ 10,000 ) in 30 days , enough to allow him to begin the production process in @entity131			0
but amazingly he reached his target after just one day - and he is now well above his original goal			2
' i am floored by the response , ' he said			0
' i was actually concerned that the low price of the product would make it a struggle to reach $ 2,000 [ £ 1,200 ] on the first day - let alone $ 10,000 [ £ 6,000 ] in 30			1
' but it all happened on day one ! my friends and family have been really supportive and i find it funny when they tell me they 're addicted to watching the screen tick up and up			0
' but more than any amounts of money , i 'm just happy to know that we 're going to be able to make @entity8 a real thing and put it on the market			0
' i love to create things and it 's a great feeling to know other people appreciate what you 've created			0
' @entity8 has a water - tight seal , activated by closing the cup with a simple quarter turn			1
with three parts made from silicone and plastic , @entity33 says the cup is easy to clean and it is also dishwasher safe			2
it comes in five different colours - red , green , blue , pink and orange - with the plastic lid available in white and dark grey			0
and as a special tribute to its humble beginnings , @entity33 has also designed a limited edition version for @entity96 - in the website 's signature light green			1
@entity8 is currently only available to @entity96 backers but @entity33 hopes to work with a @entity173 or @entity175 distributor or team up with a coffee chain to reach customers worldwide .			1
