his incredible bravery in the heat of battle in @entity4 earned 23 - year - old lance corporal @entity5 the ultimate military honour – a posthumous @entity7			1
until now , details of his courage while storming a @entity11 stronghold have been sketchy			2
but today @entity12 can reveal the astonishing story of his final hours , as told by his commanding officer who was fighting with @entity5 when he died			1
the official @entity18 report compiled by captain @entity19 – himself awarded a @entity20 for ‘ repeated courage ’ that day – reveals : the previously unseen document describing the firefight in gut - wrenching detail includes accounts by @entity26 and by @entity5 ’s comrades in the @entity28 dispatched on a dangerous mission to eliminate insurgents			1
june 13 , 2012 , dawned like any other day at @entity31 in @entity33 ’s @entity32			0
as the morning passed , temperatures soared to @entity35 and whenever possible @entity36 sought out the shade of the base ’s baked - mud walls			0
in the early afternoon , 6ft 8in @entity5 was summoned by platoon commander @entity26 , who explained that a group of @entity11 gunmen had been spotted in @entity42 , a village just over a mile from their base			1
@entity46 @entity19 outlined the mission to eliminate the insurgents and referred to maps and photographs			0
to avoid confusion in the heat of battle the compounds were identified by code numbers			0
the mission would also involve a jet equipped with video cameras circling thousands of feet above the battlefield and feeding live information to @entity61 commanders			1
the report reads : ‘ the operation was to drop the @entity64 [ @entity65 ] by helicopter in locations to the @entity68 of a group of compounds in the @entity42 area			0
‘ @entity36 was @entity72 of callsign @entity74 [ a team of six soldiers ] and would be positioned to the @entity77 area with the main objective being a tree - line where the insurgents were known to be			0
’ at around 4.20pm , @entity81 and his colleagues strapped themselves into two @entity84 helicopters			1
@entity5 , from @entity85 , @entity86 , was seated next to @entity87			2
during the short flight the good friends squeezed together for what would prove the @entity5 ’s final photograph			1
over @entity42 , they came under heavy fire from below			0
the report continues : ‘ at approximately 1630hrs the helicopter carrying @entity36 landed , the soldiers dismounted and ran across a bridge			0
@entity97 was instructed to secure what was believed to be the insurgents ’ sniper position , located in a tree - line north - east of @entity102			2
’ sprinting into position , @entity5 fired grenades from his @entity105 – a grenade launcher bolted to his rifle barrel			1
for the next ten minutes , @entity61 and @entity109 troops bombarded the tree - line , killing two insurgents			1
but @entity19 was radioed with new information			0
the pilot overhead had tracked the escape of a third gunman from the tree - line to @entity117			2
immediately @entity19 ran to the compound , throwing grenades over the 6ft walls			0
when he had used up his grenades , he ordered those soldiers from @entity74 who still had grenades left to help clear the compound			0
with the @entity11 gunman firing from inside the compound , the @entity125 knew how dangerous this was			1
and their fears were confirmed when an @entity4 soldier was killed attempting to enter the compound			2
bravery : @entity133 , left , became only the tenth member of the @entity18 since the @entity135 to receive the @entity7 , right @entity5 and @entity19 began their assault at 4.55pm			2
they climbed a perimeter wall and jumped into an alleyway			0
@entity5 threw a grenade ahead and they advanced , weapons at the ready , to an open area and a vegetable garden where they were joined by another soldier providing cover			2
the report notes : ‘ the garden was surrounded by a 2ft - high wall and was about 6ft in front of the man providing cover			2
’ there was a flat - roofed mud - hut inside the compound and @entity19 saw an insurgent emerge from a doorway and open fire towards the @entity125			2
another member of the platoon returned fire , forcing the insurgent to retreat inside , firing through a window			0
@entity19 requested reinforcements and when two more soldiers arrived , he told them to join @entity5			2
trees prevented them from throwing grenades to kill the enemy			0
although it is not in the report , @entity12 has been told that an @entity4 interpreter with the @entity125 shouted at the @entity11 fighter to surrender but he refused , shouting ‘ @entity176 ’ ( @entity175 is great )			1
then @entity5 ran to @entity19 and put to him a daring plan : ‘ he [ @entity5 ] suggested that he crawl up against the wall until he was level with the insurgent and then throw the grenade into the doorway			1
’ @entity19 had doubts , fearing @entity5 ’s plan was too dangerous , but as the report notes , they agreed the @entity5 ’s plan still represented ‘ the most risk - free approach ’			1
@entity5 set off , shuffling forward on his elbows and knees			0
ahead , a table and two chairs blocked his route			0
the furniture was only 9ft from the mud - hut , meaning any attempt to move it would be noticed			0
proud : the family of lance corporal @entity5 including his mother @entity198 , father former @entity201 and his brother and serving soldier @entity200 honour : the repatriation ceremony for @entity133 @entity5 , at @entity205 in @entity206 so @entity5 decided to crawl around – a manoeuvre that risked bringing him into the insurgent ’s line of sight			2
now @entity19 made a desperate plea , the report says			0
‘ he shouted to @entity81 to come back as he could see that the insurgent had seen @entity5 and was firing towards him with the rounds landing within a metre of him			1
’ but @entity81 – only the tenth member of the @entity18 to receive the @entity7 since the @entity135 – could not be persuaded to retreat			1
he crawled on , clutching his last grenade			0
with @entity11 rounds fizzing inches overhead , he even attempted to reassure his officer , whispering into his radio that he was ‘ almost in position ’			1
@entity5 rose into a crouching position , pulled the grenade pin and took aim			1
seeing him , the insurgent opened fire and a round struck @entity5 ’s chest			1
he was saved by his body armour but fell back , the live grenade escaping his grasp			1
lying dazed and immobile , @entity5 had no chance of escaping the blast and his colleagues were too far away to help			1
the grenade inflicted serious blast wounds			0
as the report notes , @entity5 ’s position meant ‘ no one could get to him to provide first aid as it would have put them directly in front of the insurgent ’			1
two other soldiers were badly wounded before the insurgent was finally shot dead			0
the report reads : ‘ the @entity244 moved to @entity5 ’s position ; however , no first aid was afforded as it was obvious his injuries were incompatible with life			1
’ he was declared dead at 7.40pm at @entity248			0
that evening @entity249 and other commanders met to write up their battle reports			0
these formed the basis of the @entity125 ’ application for @entity5 to receive the @entity7 .			2

unit had a @entity11 **sharpshooter** surrounded but ammo was low
@entity81 *volunteered* for dangerous solo assault with his last grenade
shot in chest as he crouched to throw it into compound
saved by body armour , but live grenade escaped his grasp as he fell
too dazed to escape the blast and was killed by *explosion*
moments before his death , @entity5 *fearlessly* ignored the captain ’s pleas to retreat to *safety* .
he was killed by his own grenade in a final attempt to eliminate a @entity11 **sharpshooter** who had pinned down @entity61 troops .
crouching 10ft from the enemy , and with *bullets* fizzing overhead , he whispered his final words : ‘ i ’m almost in position . ’
