@entity0 is convinced ailing @entity1 will one day challenge the might of @entity3 despite the two teams currently at opposite ends of the pace spectrum at present			1
@entity1 and new power - unit supplier @entity7 suffered abject humiliation in the season - opening grand prix in @entity11 earlier this month			1
the team were already without the services of big - name acquisition @entity14 after the @entity16 sustained concussion in a testing accident in @entity19			0
come the race , reserve @entity20 failed to even make it to the start line due to a power - unit issue that forced the young @entity26 to pull over on the formation lap. @entity0 waves to the crowd before the first race of the season in @entity11 @entity1 were well of the pace in @entity33 ... @entity0 finished 11th , two laps behind winner @entity35 at least @entity0 saw the chequered flag , describing it at the time as ' a small victory ' , albeit finishing two laps down on race - winner @entity35 in 11th and last place			1
despite @entity1 's seemingly hopeless position heading into sunday 's @entity42 @entity41 , a positive @entity0 can see hope on the horizon			1
' we 're a hell of a long way behind , but i feel we have something we can mould into something very special in the future , which is very exciting , ' said @entity0			2
' being 1.5 seconds off the pace and knowing you 've peaked with your package , that 's got to hurt			0
' whereas at least we have a glimmer of hope we can possibly challenge @entity3 one day			1
' asked as to the reasoning behind his belief , @entity0 replied : ' the direction with the car in terms of aerodynamics , but also with how aggressive this engine is , which is why we 're having so many issues			2
' in many ways - it 's probably wrong for me to say - it 's probably more like a @entity3 than it is the other two manufacturers ( @entity66 and @entity69 ) in terms of design , aggressiveness and packaging			2
@entity35 sprays champagne from the podium after winning the season - opening @entity11 @entity41 @entity35 led team - mate @entity76 home in @entity33 as @entity3 dominated the opening race of 2015 ' it 's just going to take a little bit of time , but if we did n't have that hope you would n't see the strong effort by the whole team			1
' they 're not heading to races because they 're paid to , they 're doing so because they 're passionate about racing			0
they 're looking forward to the future as much as i am			0
' the one bonus for @entity1 this weekend is @entity14 is poised to return , pending a final medical check by the @entity98 at the @entity99 on thursday			2
racing director @entity100 , for one , is happy to have the @entity16 back on board as he said : ' i 'm pleased to see @entity14 back in the car			0
' he 's raring to go , and i know he 's been working hard behind the scenes to prepare himself for this weekend			0
' @entity14 is poised to return to the @entity1 cockpit providing he passes an @entity98 medical on thursday			0

@entity1 *driver* @entity0 *optimistic* heading into the @entity42 *gp*
he finished two laps down on race - winner @entity35 in @entity33
but @entity111 believes @entity1 can ' possibly challenge @entity3 one day '
