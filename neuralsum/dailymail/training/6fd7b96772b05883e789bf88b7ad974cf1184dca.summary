by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 still has unfinished business in the @entity4 with the @entity5 , but would one day relish the opportunity to be at the forefront of any permanent expansion into @entity9			1
@entity2 , brought up in @entity10 before moving with his parents back to @entity12 , is hoping to again be involved when the @entity5 take part in @entity14 , which for the first time will see three regular - season matches played at @entity17			1
@entity19 will ' host ' the @entity20 on september 28 , before the @entity21 against the @entity5 in october followed by the @entity22 facing the @entity23 at the start of november			0
brit of all right : @entity2 ( left ) lines up with fellow @entity4 players at @entity17 on wednesday it has been suggested the @entity4 is considering the viability of a franchise in @entity32 , with @entity9 the most likely hub city given the huge success of the sell - out games at @entity17 , where the @entity23 have signed up for one ' home ' fixture through to 2016			1
however , the logistics of getting players across the @entity40 on a regular basis and the physical toll that would take remains a subject for debate , but it is a future scenario @entity2 , a two - time @entity47 winner with the @entity48 , would welcome			2
' there would be some complaints at first , but they ( players ) would get over that			0
they ( @entity4 ) would make it work - this is what we love to do , play football and we are getting paid extremely well to do it , ' @entity2 said			1
success story : the @entity23 run out to take on the @entity60 at @entity17 last year ' i see what the @entity4 is doing , and they are not going to leave me behind , i am going to be on the forefront of coming out here , broadcasting and bringing the game to the audience out here , with the fact i was born here in @entity9 and have been doing some of the things i have been able to do in the @entity4			1
' @entity2 may turn 33 later this year and have also played in the @entity73 twice , but for now at least , his only focus is on more game time as the @entity5 look to mount a push for the play - offs in 2014 after a hugely disappointing 4 - 12 record last season			1
' sometimes you do think about that ( why continue on ) , but then there are still some things you need to accomplish , ' said @entity2 , who played at @entity17 for the @entity48 against the @entity20 in 2007			2
having a ball : @entity21 linebacker @entity85 ( left ) and @entity2 pose for a photo at @entity17 ' that is the only thing which keeps me going , because i feel i can get better , so that is what i am going to try to do			2
' i think we have a good chance this year			0
' in the @entity4 , the difference can be just 10 seconds worth of plays , that is all it is , one missed step here or a catch there , the games are so close			0
' any team can go from being bad one season to good , and from being good to bad - and that is something which makes the @entity4 so dramatic			0
' reaching out : the @entity4 are looking to gain more support from across the globe @entity2 intends to make the most of a welcome break from the rigours of pre-season training			0
' i left @entity9 when i was really young , so i do n't have too many concrete memories here , but coming back has been great , ' said @entity2 , now in his second season at the @entity5			1
' my sister is going to school out here , so i will be seeing her , along with some friends i grew up with in @entity9 and @entity12			0
' nobody knows anything about you here , which in a way is great , so you can just show up and enjoy yourself			0
