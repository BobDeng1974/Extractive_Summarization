by @entity0 published : 20:45 est , 6 may 2014 updated : 20:56 est , 6 may 2014 shouting , kicking , punching and attempting to choke his wife - all symptoms suffered by a sleeping 70 - year - old @entity5 man with rapid eye movement behaviour disorder			1
while most of us enjoy sleeping , the man was suffering one of the most bizarre sleep disorders , which was so bad he strapped himself into bed to prevent injuring his wife in a violent outburst			1
a rare condition , rapid eye movement behaviour disorder takes place in the rapid eye movement stage of sleep and sees abnormal and often violent outbursts of vocal or physical behaviour in response to dreams and mirrors dream content and can affect men and women of all ages			1
nightmare : a 70 - year - old man suffered an undiagnosed rare sleep disorder , which saw him violently react to terrifying dreams after about an eight - year history of severe sleep disturbances occurring almost nightly , the elderly man was promoted by his wife to visit a general practitioner about the unusual and dangerous behaviour , the @entity34 reported on may 5			1
following the visit , the man was referred to a specialist sleep service in december 2010			2
revealing details about his severe sleep disturbance , the man was experiencing terrifying dreams , in which he feared for his life while being attacked or chased - and he remembered it all vividly			1
as a result of the dreams , the man would wake in bizarre positions with his clothes thrown around the bedroom			0
but most worryingly , while he was still sleeping , the man would shout in reaction and suffer dangerously violent motor responses			0
@entity58 behaviour disorder takes place in the rapid eye movement stage of sleep and sees abnormal and often violent outbursts of vocal or physical behaviour unknowingly to him , his wife became a target - kicking , punching and even trying to choke her			1
even after falling out of bed , the man smashed himself into bedroom furniture including bedside tables and wardrobes			0
with the violent nature of his disorder causing physical harm to himself and his wife , as a precaution , mattresses were used on the floor in an attempt to reduce further injury			2
eventually , the man tried restraining himself to the bed frame using two belts strapped tightly around his chest and waist to stop him from his violent outbursts			2
with the behaviour continuing , his wife was forced to sleep in a separate move to prevent herself from being hurt			2
despite the suffering the rare disorder , the man did not have a history of snoring or other symptoms suggestive of obstructive sleep apnoea			2
nor was he suffering neurological problems or psychiatric illness			0
the elderly man 's actions became so bad because of the disorder that his wife has to sleep in a different room for her own safety monitored by video overnight , abnormal motor activity was detected while he was in rapid eye movement sleep , leading to a rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder diagnosis			1
the diagnosis lead to successful drug treatment and at a two - year follow - up , the @entity34 reported the man maintained improvements with violent dream enactment behaviour occurring rarely			1
he also recorded no cases of falling out of bed or injuries , improvement in sleep quality and there is still no sign of neurological symptoms			0
the @entity34 reported that between 33 and 65 per cent of patients with the disorder suffer sleep - related injuries to themselves or their bed partner while men aged over 50 are most affected , both genders of all ages can suffer the disorder			1
disruptive : outbursts caused by the disorder can range multiple times every night to once every few months outbursts endured by those with the disorder can range multiple times every night to once every few months			0
the disorder can be associated with an underlying neuropathological conditions including @entity138 disease			0
treatment focuses on reducing the nightmares and associated behaviours and any related injuries			0
@entity143 for @entity145 's dr @entity144 explained that during repaid eye movement sleep , which makes up about 25 per cent of sleep time , most people normally lose a lot of muscle tone			1
this renders them virtually paralysed , @entity151 reported			0
but for people with the disorder , they maintain their muscle tone , which can even increase because their bodies have not been sent a message from their brain to relax .			0
