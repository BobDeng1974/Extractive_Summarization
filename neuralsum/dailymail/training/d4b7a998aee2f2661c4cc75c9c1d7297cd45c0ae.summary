by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 : 14:40 est , 24 december 2013 @entity3 : 16:49 est , 24 december 2013 the @entity5 government has taken unusual step of revoking most diplomatic privileges afforded @entity9 consular staff in the country - including immunity from prosecution			1
the revocation of diplomatic privileges comes as the maid slave wage controversy involving @entity5 diplomat @entity16 threatens to further erode @entity5 - @entity9 relations			1
identity cards issued to both consular officials and their family were revoked			1
officials received new cards showing their updated diplomatic status , their families will not be granted any special status			2
the move was first reported by @entity28			0
' mistake ' : @entity16 's lawyer claims that officials made an error while reviewing a work visa form she 'd submitted for her @entity35 maid the @entity5 government changed privileges extended to @entity9 consular officials and their families to bring them in line with what the @entity9 grants @entity5 consular officials , a source told @entity28			1
this new status will apply to all @entity43 accredited consular staff in the country and came after a significant development in @entity35 in ms @entity16 's favor			1
the @entity48 monday approved a request to accredit her to the @entity5 mission to the @entity43 , according to reports			1
this should grant her immunity from prosecution of any form , but @entity9 officials do not appear to be budging			1
a spokesperson for @entity9 attorney @entity60 told @entity61 that authorities have no plans to drop any charges			1
' as of this time , the charges stand , ' the spokesperson added , declining any further comment			2
these comments come after attorney @entity68 accused authorities of misinterpreting the salary paid to housekeeper @entity70 an intended salary and actual salary , according to the @entity73			0
the intended salary was significantly higher than what was actually paid , as ms @entity77 ' often failed to work 40 hours per week , leading salary to be adjusted accordingly , officials told the @entity73			0
the servant was paid $ 9.75 an hour with deductions taken for various expenses and some salary paid in cash , the @entity5 government contends			0
@entity9 officials have also declined to comment on this assertion			1
@entity16 was arrested earlier this month after being accused of lying on a visa application for her housekeeper and paying her only $ 3 per hour these developments came as it was revealed a lawsuit filed months ago on behalf of the housekeeper alleging poor working conditions			0
@entity92 , ms @entity93 's husband , filed a petition at the @entity95 in @entity96 in july saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day			0
mr @entity92 also said the consular official 's father @entity98 had threatened mrs @entity93 's family saying that he would have them abducted and framed on false drug charges			0
the release of the new document this week reveals that a legal complaint was lodged against @entity16 in her home country prior to charges of visa fraud being filed against her in the @entity9 this month			1
mr @entity92 's claim was dismissed later in july because the @entity5 court had ' no jurisdiction ... on foreign soil '			0
consular official dr @entity16 was arrested this month as she dropped her children off at their @entity115 school			0
she is accused of lying on a visa application for mrs @entity93 with prosecutors claiming she only paid the servant $ 3 per hour			0
@entity92 , the husband of housekeeper @entity93 ( pictured ) , filed a court petition in @entity96 saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day by diplomat @entity16 in @entity35 in the petition , first seen by @entity122 , a concerned mr @entity92 wrote : ' the treatment of @entity70 by @entity16 is tantamount to keeping a person in slavery - like conditions or keeping a person in bondage			1
' the petition also stated : ' @entity98 called @entity70 's family several times and threatened them that they would have to face dire consequences if she complains and that he would ruin their future , get them abducted and frame false charges of drugs against them			0
' mr @entity92 also wrote that @entity16 had accused his wife of stealing in front of a @entity9 immigration officer but would not provide details of what the woman took			2
mrs @entity93 's daughter @entity143 also wrote a letter to @entity9 officials saying that her mother was unhappy and wanted to return to @entity5 but the diplomat refused to let her go			1
mr @entity92 's claim was dismissed in july , according to his lawyer , because the high court claimed ' no jurisdiction on a crime committed on foreign soil '			0
the case has escalated into an international incident with @entity5 reacting with fury over the treatment of @entity16 who claims she was strip searched at a @entity35 jail before being held in a cell with drug addicts and sex workers			2
@entity98 , father of @entity5 diplomat @entity16 , has been accused of harassing the family of her housekeeper after they complained about her treatment prosecutors allege that @entity16 falsely signed visa documents for the worker saying that she would be paid $ 4,500 a month			1
then , when the housekeeper came to the @entity9 , @entity16 told her that she would be making only 30,000 rupees a month - less than $ 600 , according to prosecutors			1
@entity5 's foreign minister has demanded the @entity9 drop charges against @entity16			1
although secretary of state @entity175 made a phone call to @entity5 officials last week to placate the situation , mr @entity60 released a statement saying that the charges would not be dropped			2
the statement read : ' one wonders why there is so much outrage about the alleged treatment of the @entity5 national accused of perpetrating these acts , but precious little outrage about the alleged treatment of the @entity5 victim and her spouse ? ' attorney @entity191 , who is representing mrs @entity93 though the non-profit victim assistance agency @entity192 , spoke on sunday of her ‘ frustration and disappointment ’ that focus had slipped from ‘ crimes that were committed ’ to ‘ the criminal defendant			0
she pointed out that the case was about dr @entity16 allegedly lying to the federal government about the wages she was paying mrs @entity93			0
mrs @entity93 has claimed she as paid just $ 3.31 an hour , below minium wage			0
in the dock : an artist 's sketch of @entity16 at her arraignment in @entity206 last week protesters in the eastern @entity5 city of @entity209 , burn an effigy of @entity211 as the international fall - out of dr @entity16 's domestic dispute continues to escalate ms @entity191 refused to comment on her client and her family ’s whereabouts since mrs @entity93 walked out of her job in june			1
@entity191 , who is representing @entity93 , she says the real story of the alleged fraud has been lost in the diplomatic row mrs @entity93 ’s husband @entity92 and parents flew to the @entity9 two days before police swooped on @entity16 and arresting her at the gates of her daughter ’s @entity226 school			1
@entity9 diplomats in @entity5 swiftly found many of their privileges rescinded and safety barriers removed from their embassy in @entity96			2
secretary of state @entity175 expressed his ‘ regret as well as his concern ’ over the incident in a telephone call to @entity5 national security advisor @entity237			0
he spoke of his hope that the ‘ close and vital relationship with @entity5 ’ remain unharmed			0
but nothing short of dropping the charges – one count of @entity243 one of false statement – against dr @entity16 seems likely to satisfy @entity5 authorities in the case which has now been raised in the nation ’s parliament			2
against this backdrop mrs @entity191 ’s statement continued : ‘ mrs @entity93 is not on trial here and we think that the message here has been lost in the fact that there are charges against @entity16 for violating @entity9 law and those charges relate to the underpayment of wages to a domestic worker			2
‘ that is the story that has been lost in the diplomatic row that has erupted between @entity9 and @entity5			2
’ a group supporting domestic workers ' rights demonstrate across the street from the @entity5 consulate general on december 20 in @entity35			0

diplomatic privileges extended to the families have been severed
@entity5 diplomat @entity16 was accredited to the @entity5 mission to the @entity43 - providing her diplomatic immunity
@entity9 officials tell @entity61 ' the charges still stand '
