@entity2 fighters are being trained to fly three captured fighter jets at an air base in @entity5 , observers claimed yesterday			1
the reported flights are believed to be the first time the militant group has taken to the air and raises the possibility of attacks on @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity15 targets in neighbouring @entity16			1
@entity17 , who runs the @entity12 - based @entity18 , said the militants were flying the planes on ‘ short flight ’ training at the @entity23 military airport east of the city of @entity25 , where the group has a major base			1
fighter : it is not clear if @entity2 ' jets are equipped with weaponry nor if the pilots are able to fly long distances , but witnesses said the planes appear to have been seized from the @entity37 ( pictured ) power : @entity2 has been steadily building a full - equipped military - including large tanks , such as the one pictured here in @entity41 )			1
much of the equipment in their possession has been seized from @entity5 regime forces show of strength : @entity2 militants take part in a military parade along the streets of @entity41 earlier this year ‘ they have trainers , @entity16 officers who were pilots before for ( former @entity16 president ) @entity53 , ’ mr @entity17 said			1
‘ people saw the flights , they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back , ’ he added , citing witnesses in northern @entity55 near the base , which is 45 miles south of @entity57			1
it was not clear if the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances			2
witnesses near the base in northern @entity5 said the jets appeared to be decades old @entity73 or @entity74 models captured from the @entity5 military			1
@entity77 accounts linked to @entity2 , also known as @entity2 and @entity78 , had previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of @entity5 , but the aircraft had appeared unusable , according to analysts and diplomats			1
the group has captured several major military airfields , including the vast @entity88 complex , close to their headquarters in the @entity5 city of @entity41 and seized aircraft , helicopters and heavy weapons			2
the base was reportedly one of the @entity5 military ’s largest facilities in the region , with several warplane squadrons , helicopters , tanks , artillery and ammunition			2
defence analysts say that it unlikely the group 's migs could be used conventionally as the @entity13 - led coalition of @entity5 forces would shoot them down			2
leader : news of @entity2 ' test flights comes as @entity113 - which has previously condemned @entity2 for being too brutal - ostensibly sought to repair ties with the group led by @entity116 ( pictured ) declaration : titled ' statement on the @entity120 ' , the document is @entity113 's strongest show of support for @entity2 since leader @entity123 denounced the group for the brutal tactics late last year @entity78 militants have been almost entirely driven out of the @entity5 city of @entity128 after a fightback by @entity131 forces , who vowed to either defeat the terrorists or die trying			1
the extremists have abandoned all their positions in the city except two small pockets of resistance in the east , @entity131 commander @entity140 said			0
as recently as monday it looked as if the fall of @entity128 was imminent			0
the massively outgunned @entity131 fighters had been pushed back ever closer to the city centre by @entity2 militants advancing into the suburbs , leaving hundreds of mainly elderly residents facing rape and massacre			2
but with the help of the most intense @entity13 and @entity152 bombing raids of the @entity154 campaign so far , the @entity131 forces have been able to kill hundreds of militants over the past two days			0
they have also managed to force the militants have not been killed to retreat further into the outskirts of the town			0
news that @entity2 have been almost entirely forced out of @entity128 comes after two days of heavy air strikes by @entity13 warplanes			2
instead , they could be deployed for spectacular low - level suicide attacks on western targets in the @entity131 city or @entity166 or the @entity16 capital @entity168 where the @entity13 and @entity12 have a major presence			2
the @entity13 military said yesterday it was unaware of any flight operations by the group ‘ in @entity5 or elsewhere ’			0
‘ we ’re not aware of @entity2 ( is ) conducting any flight operations in @entity5 or elsewhere , ’ said @entity175 spokesman colonel @entity174			1
‘ we continue to keep a close eye on @entity2 activity in @entity5 and @entity16 and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment , facilities , fighters and centres of gravity , wherever they may be , ’ he added			1
meanwhile @entity131 forces , backed by @entity13 - led air strikes , are said to be continuing to make gains in their fight with militants in the key northern @entity5 town of @entity193			2
@entity13 - led warplanes again struck militants ' positions yesterday , taking advantage of new coordination with the town ’s @entity131 defenders , who are identifying targets			0
@entity131 commander @entity140 claimed the extremists have abandoned all of their positions in the town , except for two small pockets of resistance in the east			0
as recently as monday it looked as if the fall of @entity193 was imminent , with the massively outgunned @entity131 fighters pushed back ever closer to the city centre by @entity2 militants advancing into the suburbs , leaving hundreds of mainly elderly residents fearing rape and massacre			0
advance : the @entity78 and its allied @entity220 militants seized the @entity222 city of @entity223 , parts of @entity225 and large rural areas of @entity222 early this year checkpoint : earlier today , @entity16 officials in the western @entity222 province said a curfew has been imposed in the provincial capital @entity225 ( pictured ) over fears that the @entity78 group might try to advance on the city security : @entity2 has been making gains around @entity225 in recent weeks against the embattled @entity16 military , despite ongoing @entity13 - led coalition airstrikes on the militants activists say more than 600 people have been killed since the jihadist group launched its assault on the mainly @entity131 town a month ago			1
capturing the town would give the jihadists unbroken control of a massive stretch of the @entity5 - @entity57 border			1
despite their gains , @entity131 leaders say @entity193 can not survive long - term without arms and ammunition reaching the defenders			0
claims of @entity131 successes in @entity193 came as the new @entity259 human rights commissioner , @entity258 , described @entity2 as the antithesis of human rights and ‘ a diabolical , potentially genocidal movement ’			0
‘ the way it has spread its tentacles into other countries , employing social media and the internet to brainwash and recruit people from across the globe , reveals it to be the product of a perverse and lethal marriage of a new form of nihilism with the digital age , ’ he added			0
six senior figures in the @entity280 @entity279 have pledged allegiance to the @entity78 and its leader @entity116 in a symbol of the terrorists ' expanding influence among @entity286 groups			0
withdrawing their loyalty to the @entity289 @entity279 's leader @entity288 , the men - made up of the group 's chief spokesman @entity291 and five regional commanders - said they will remain members of the @entity280 @entity279 , but added they now consider themselves affiliates of @entity2			1
the move is likely to have serious consequences for security in @entity280 , particularly near the @entity289 border where all six of the men are based , leaving it open to the kind of violence and brutal oppression @entity2 has employed in the vast swathes of @entity5 and @entity16 under the group 's control			1
militants : withdrawing their loyalty to the @entity289 @entity279 's leader @entity288 , the men - made up of the group 's chief spokesman @entity291 ( centre ) and five regional commanders - said they will remain members of the @entity280 @entity279 , but added they now consider themselves affiliates of @entity2 the official announcement of the six men 's declaration of allegiance to @entity2 came in the form of an audio recording that emerged on wednesday			1
however rumours had been circulating for weeks that several senior figures in the @entity280 @entity279 were set to declare their loyalty to @entity323			0
' i show allegiance to the commander of faithful , @entity328 @entity326 , and will listen and obey every order of you and will follow your orders regardless of what circumstances may be , ' @entity291 said in the recording			0
there is now concern that other senior figures in the @entity280 @entity279 may defect to @entity2 , including the group 's overall leader @entity339 , who has previously voiced support for the terror group			0
despite several members having declared their @entity2 sympathies , the announcement is the first time any senior figure within the @entity280 @entity279 has actually sworn allegiance to @entity323 .			0

witnesses say @entity2 are carrying out test flights at an airport near @entity25
understood to have captured three @entity355 - made jets from @entity5 @entity37
they are using former @entity16 @entity37 officers to train *prospective* pilots
news comes as @entity113 looks to mend relations with the @entity78
statement emerged today calling for jihadists to set aside their *differences*
