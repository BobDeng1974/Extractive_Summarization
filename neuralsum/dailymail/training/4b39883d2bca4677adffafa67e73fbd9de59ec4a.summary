a soldier who faced losing most of his pension after he was made redundant has been granted a transfer within the @entity3 that means he will now receive his full entitlement			1
sergeant @entity5 , 35 , of the @entity6 , was 72 hours away from qualifying for a substantial @entity3 pension when he was told he was to lose the job he had held for nearly 18 years			1
as a result , he and his wife @entity9 , 32 , who live in service housing in @entity11 , @entity12 , feared he would miss out on a sum totalling almost £ 175,000			0
sergeant @entity5 , 35 , pictured with his wife @entity9 , 32 , had faced losing his job with the @entity3 three days before he would qualify for his full pension - but he has now been given the opportunity for a transfer the case had fuelled suspicions that the @entity3 , which is shedding 20,000 personnel in a cost - cutting exercise , was targeting those within touching distance of generous lifetime payments			1
and it sparked criticisms that the @entity28 was breaking the @entity29 , the nation 's duty of care to troops			0
but today , after significant media coverage and a petition signed nearly 100,000 supporters , the @entity33 said @entity37 had been given the chance to take on a new role in the @entity3			1
an @entity33 spokesman said : ' there have been a number of inaccuracies reported surrounding an individual soldier in an online petition			0
' we can be clear that the individual in question has successfully applied for a transfer to another branch within the @entity3 , and subject to successful completion of training will not be made redundant			1
' the individual is fully aware of this and has been kept informed throughout the process			0
we will continue to work with him to secure his transfer within the @entity3			1
' in a statement , @entity37 added : ' there has been a considerable amount of misunderstanding surrounding an online petition with the aim of securing my pension			2
' i was selected for redundancy but have applied for transfer to another service within the @entity3			1
i have been successful in the application process and am looking forward to beginning training for my new role			0
' poppy : mrs @entity72 has written an open letter to the prime minister asking for better treatment for her soldier husband it comes after mrs @entity72 started an online petition on @entity79 asking the prime minister to give her husband his job back that by tonight had been signed by nearly 100,000 people			0
mrs @entity72 , whose husband has served in @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , wrote on the site : ' when @entity5 was informed of his redundancy i felt like my heart had been ripped out , more for @entity5 than me			2
' everything he knew and had worked for from the age of 16 taken away			0
we had planned on using the pension to secure a mortgage when we left army accommodation and to support our young family while @entity5 established a new career on civvy street			2
' after a life of service for our country our family 's financial security has now been cruelly snatched away from us			0
' she said calling it a ' pension ' was incorrect , arguing that the military pension was ' the key financial promise on which personnel are recruited , retained and promoted '			0
@entity37 , a father of two , whose case was first reported by the @entity112 in july , has been a soldier since he was 18 years old			1
the non-commissioned officer has also served as a casualty visitor , providing support for the families of killed or injured troops			0
he was told in june that he had been selected for compulsory redundancy from his job as a welfare officer with a 12 - month notice period , ending on june 18 2014			2
had he been allowed to work until june 21 , he would have qualified for an immediate pension and tax - free lump sum worth an estimated £ 261,278 over his lifetime instead he faced a redundancy payout of £ 87,417 , with a £ 4,374 - a - year pension once he reached 60			2
in the preamble to the petition started by @entity72 , a mental health care manager , she wrote how she and her husband had felt ' honoured to be part of the @entity3 family ' and said they wanted to continue to be part of it			0
and now they have the chance after her husband was offered a transfer to another branch of the @entity3 - an opportunity that means he will be able to collect his full pension			1
if @entity37 successful completes the training for the new job , he will now longer face redundancy			1
and even if he fails the training programme he will be eligible for his immediate pension due to the time spent on his ongoing transfer process			0
the @entity33 's spokesman added : ' all those made redundant will receive an @entity29 pension and a generous compensation package			1
' inevitably we have to draw the line somewhere , but those who are close to their immediate pension point ... will receive a larger tax - free lump sum in compensation			0
' army pensions are one of the key selling points to would - be recruits , and guarantees retired soldiers a full monthly pension based on their final salary			2
one of its chief attractions is the fact that contributors to the scheme do not have their salary deducted each month , as in many other pension schemes			0
after two years of regular service , soldiers are entitled to receive the pension when they are 65			1
soldiers who serve for 12 years will receive a tax - free resettlement grant to ease them into their civilian life			0
and anyone who is over 40 and has served at least 18 years can claim an immediate pension and tax - free lump sum when they leave the @entity3 , with a second lump sum when they turn 65			1
from april 2015 changes to the @entity186 will come in , meaning soldiers will have to work for 20 years rather than 18 before they can qualify for a full pension			1
the new scheme will also see retired soldiers able to claim at a reduced rate , rather than the full rate , from the age of 55 until they reach the planned state pension age of 67 .			2

*sgt* @entity5 , 35 , was to be made redundant just 72 hours short of the 18 years service he needed to collect his full @entity3 pension
case sparked *accusations* that the @entity3 was seeking to save cash by targeting soldiers close to generous lifetime payments for redundancy
but now the @entity33 says @entity37 has applied for transfer to another job within the @entity3 and will be entitled to his full retirement package
