the @entity0 and @entity2 secretary @entity1 said the cash pledge will ' improve access to low carbon energy ' in developing countries hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers ’ cash is to be poured into @entity9 to help it cope with the impact of climate change			1
the £ 330million handout will be spent over the next four years on schemes to install solar power plants and encouraging investment in low - carbon transport			2
one of the main beneficiaries will be @entity9 , a country which is prosperous enough to have its own space agency			1
@entity1 , the @entity22 energy secretary , will unveil the foreign aid package at a @entity25 summit on climate change which opens today			1
the largesse will fuel criticism from @entity30 backbenchers over @entity32 ’s promise to increase @entity34 spending on aid at a time when public services in @entity34 are facing swingeing cuts			2
@entity39 , @entity30 mp for @entity40 , said : ‘ it is completely unjustifiable to spend so much money at a time when we ’re reducing the number of police officers in this country			2
’ fellow @entity30 mp @entity53 said : ‘ what makes it worse is that much of the aid budget is spent on things that are not really benefiting developing countries			2
the answer is trade , not aid			2
’ in a sign that the government is pulling in different directions on environmental policy , @entity56 will announce tomorrow that the @entity61 will offer £ 250million in tax breaks to firms hit by mr @entity1 ’s climate change policies			2
he will use his @entity65 – effectively a mini-budget – to help companies that use large amounts of energy after being warned that @entity34 ’s plans to cut carbon emissions faster than our competitors was driving business abroad			1
@entity74 is on : solar panels are powering homes in southern @entity77 energy - intensive firms such as cement , aluminium and steel makers will get 95 per cent relief from the climate change levy as well as tens of millions of pounds to offset new carbon levies			1
mr @entity56 insists @entity34 should not seek to lead the world in cutting emissions and that he is not prepared to bankrupt @entity34 businesses by putting them at a competitive disadvantage			0
but mr @entity1 is pressing ahead with spending taxpayers ’ money promoting green policies in the rest of the world			1
in the second week of the @entity25 climate change conference in the @entity9 city of @entity96 , he is expected to say the aid will go towards a variety of anti-climate change schemes , such as helping @entity9 farmers protect their crops against flooding and drought , installing solar panels in villages , and building slurry pits to produce gas for generators			1
projects to target illegal logging in tropical forests will also get cash			0
@entity113 and @entity114 are expected to benefit , as well as @entity9 , the most developed country on the continent with an economy which grew far faster than @entity34 ’s last year			1
it is not known whether the money will go straight to governments or whether it will be channelled via charities and companies			0
some £ 282.5million has already been allocated towards aid for foreign climate - change projects			0
but next week ’s announcement will see hundreds of millions more allocated to @entity9 climate - change projects by 2015			1
last night critics questioned whether so much money should continue to be ploughed into @entity9 , where aid money has a history of disappearing as a result of corruption			1
just last week , an independent watchdog found that the rapid expansion of @entity34 ’s international aid programme has left it increasingly exposed to fraud			0
@entity136 , president of the @entity138 - based think tank @entity137 , said mr @entity1 ’s announcement would be seen as a ‘ bribe ’			0
a @entity142 thermal satellite image shows the world 's arctic surface temperature trends			0
experts have warned that levels of the greenhouse gases that drive climate change have reached a record high ‘ the timing seems to be a cynical move by the @entity153 , ’ he said			0
‘ it suggests this is an attempt to bribe @entity9 governments to sign up to whatever deals the @entity34 government wants them to sign up to in @entity96			1
the money will almost certainly go to foreign governments and do little to improve the lot of the poor			0
’ @entity164 of the @entity165 ’ @entity163 said : ‘ the government should be freezing international aid , not increasing it			0
‘ rather than throwing money away on corruption and programmes that deliver little of real substance , aid should be targeted at the world ’s poorest who really need help			0
’ a spokesman for mr @entity1 ’s @entity176 would not confirm the total amount , and said it was not new money as it will be drawn from the @entity181 ’s fully - funded £ 2.9billion @entity180			0
last night @entity183 sources said @entity184 had been instrumental in raising his concern about the cost of energy and climate change policies on manufacturing businesses , writing to the prime minister and @entity56 on the issue in april			1
‘ they have made considerable capital investment in their @entity34 plants to make sure they are energy efficient			1
this investment shows their commitment to the @entity34 , ’ said one			0
‘ that ’s why it ’s so vital we do n’t repay their faith in @entity34 with the introduction of a hefty tax , which could see them relocate and result in the loss of @entity34 jobs and do nothing about reducing global carbon emissions			0

@entity9 will be one of the main beneficiaries
