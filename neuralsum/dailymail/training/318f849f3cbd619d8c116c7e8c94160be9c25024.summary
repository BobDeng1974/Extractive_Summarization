by @entity0 @entity1 is due in @entity2 on monday for talks with @entity4			1
the 22 - year - old is a free agent but the @entity2 will have to pay compensation to @entity7 for around £ 155,000			1
@entity8 have also shown an interest as have @entity10 but compensation would be higher for an @entity13 club			2
@entity1 recently spoke about the ' dream ' opportunity @entity4 offered him to follow in his father ’s footsteps			1
the @entity29 under 21 international , who spent the second half of last season at @entity33 , has options to remain in the @entity35 but it is the prospect of moving to @entity2 that has captured the imagination			1
‘ it is unbelievable to be mentioned with them , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ the history that is there with my old man … it is dreams , it really is dreams			0
the name of @entity4 , the history , the stature of the club			0
going abroad would n’t faze me			2
‘ look at @entity51 – it shows that sometimes it is better to make these moves when you are a boy			1
i have got to make sure that wherever i am next season , i am a better player			0
there are still things that i need to learn and get better			0
but that type of interest is fantastic			0
’ the list of @entity13 exports to foreign clubs has barely been added to since @entity65 ’s high - profile loan move from @entity66 to @entity67 in 2011 and @entity1 believes the whole experience of moving to @entity2 – if that is what he decides – would have a number of positive spin - offs			1
‘ you do n’t see many @entity13 players doing it , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ whether it is the risk of the language , us @entity13 are very lazy because we only want to speak our own language and if no one else does then no one cares			0
sometimes you have to look at options like that as it opens up new horizons			0
‘ learning a different language and culture , but i have n’t ruled out staying in @entity29			2
wherever i choose , it will come down to a gut feeling			0
i have got a great man behind me to help and advise me but , when it comes down to it , it will be my decision			0
’ on the hunt ! @entity4 have admitted their interest in signing @entity7 winger @entity1 making waves : @entity1 has been on loan at @entity33 from @entity7 since the january transfer window			1
