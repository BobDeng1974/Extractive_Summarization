by @entity0 published : 04:42 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 08:37 est , 28 may 2013 a daredevil artist took his life in his hands by going beneath the waves to get face to face with a pack of killer sharks and sketch their portraits			1
@entity11 , 52 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , is the first person ever to sketch great white sharks in their natural habitat off the coast of @entity17			1
he travelled to the country and dived in the planet 's most shark - infested waters to capture the terrifying marine predators first hand			1
he then spent 90 minutes in a shark cage studying the beasts and creating a series of rough sketches which he later used as the basis of his paintings			0
mr @entity11 created his art in sharks ' seal hunting ground off @entity33 - a stretch of water known as @entity33 because it has the world 's biggest concentration of great whites			1
' these days , there are so many wildlife artists out there , you 've got to do something different , ' he said			0
' you want to be inspired and really want to do it - and great whites fill that gap			2
but you ca n't see them in an aquarium - if you want to see great whites , you have to go to them , to the ocean			2
' to see them in their environment where you are the one in the cage is very exciting			0
' most artists who paint wildlife do n't get out there to see it - only a small minority do			2
most paint from photos or zoos and put the animals into a wild environment			1
' you can always tell because the animal 's not scarred , or its muscle tone is different			0
' every great white shark painting i 've ever seen has been from photographs - as far as i can tell , no - one has ever gone out to draw them in the flesh			2
' but to my mind , the best part is going out there and seeing the animal in the wild			1
' rough draft : a preparatory study of a great white drawn by mr @entity11 and used to create his final artwork getting the angles : self - taught mr @entity11 spent 90 minutes below the surface on his quest to ' draw @entity103 ' mr @entity11 and a cameraman were lowered in the seven - man cage to which the freshly severed head of a tuna fish was attacked to act bait to draw the hungry sharks nearby			1
within minutes the @entity110 began circling and mr @entity11 , with an aqualung on his back , started drawing			1
' i call my sketches " lessons in looking " - they are snapshots which you use and draw on to incorporate into the finished painting , ' he said			2
' at this stage it is about actually looking at the animal			0
taking a photograph is different - it is instant and you do n't really look at the animal properly			2
' when you are sketching you really look - where their eye is in relation to the mouth , how big the rear fin is compared to the length of the body , what the muscle tone is , etcetera			2
' i want to look into their eyes and see how they narrow , see how their brows lower			0
the idea is to really study something close up , to observe it first hand			2
' any underwater painting is going to be very crude but it gives me a framework and i begin to think how the painting might look , about the composition , the light , the colours			0
' it 's not going to be a polished , finished product , it 's all about looking and teaching yourself about the animal and seeing it in its natural environment			0
' i used the sketch as a reference and then produced the painting from it once i got home			0
' teeming with sharks : the spot off @entity33 chosen by mr @entity11 is a favourite seal hunting ground known as @entity33 , which has the world 's biggest concentration of great whites ' lessons in looking ' : mr @entity11 said sketching underwater was challenging , but worth it to get a feel for what the great white sharks look like first - hand and from close up drawing deep : by witnessing the animals in the flesh , mr @entity11 says he is able to get a better impression of the details to paint a more lifelike and evocative painting thumbs up : mr @entity11 spent 90 minutes in the cage studying the great whites			1
he said that seeing the animals in their natural environment gives a more realistic result in wildlife artwork the diving team who escorted mr @entity11 told him there could be just 1,000 great whites left in the world			1
the artist added : ' i 'd love to think i 'm the first person to do this - but i could also be one of the last if there really are so few left			0
' as well as his sketches , @entity11 got around 150 photos from his dive plus video footage to use back in his studio in @entity12			1
he says he saw around half a dozen great whites while he was underwater , some up to 16ft long			0
' it was a great thrill to see them			0
they seemed intelligent - they were checking me out , just as much as i was checking them , ' he said			0
' it was very difficult to sketch well - it was a bit like being in a truck on an unmade road , the swell pushing me up and down in the cage - it was far from my comfort zone			1
' but it was worth it to get a little bit of reference , to get a feel for what they really look like close up			0
' the result : mr @entity11 with one of the paintings inspired by his experiences with the great whites			1
he has been an artist for more than two decades and regularly travels to @entity17 and @entity228 to see his subjects in the wild another of mr @entity11 's canvases : he also leads art safaris and lectures with demonstrations painting wildlife on cruise ships mr @entity11 has received widespread critical acclaim for his work - despite only having an o level in art. he was a musician for ten years before first picking up a paintbrush over 20 years ago and now travels regularly to @entity17 and @entity228 painting animals in the wild , with elephants his personal favourite			1
he also leads art safaris and lectures with demonstrations painting wildlife on cruise ships			0
one of his biggest inspirations is @entity251 , 82 , who is famous for his wildlife paintings , particularly of elephants and tigers			0

@entity11 plunged beneath the waves off @entity17 to sketch the deadly predators
he says that experiencing the animals first - hand and in the wild is the ' best part ' of his *job*
