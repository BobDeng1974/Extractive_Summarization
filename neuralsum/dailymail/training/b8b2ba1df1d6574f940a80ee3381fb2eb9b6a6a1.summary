by @entity1 reporter published : 18:13 est , 11 august 2013 updated : 18:14 est , 11 august 2013 when he was just a baby , 6 - year - old @entity2 was diagnosed with a rare form of epilepsy called @entity5 , which causes him to have violent seizures several times a day			1
the seizures were so bad that they prevented the @entity10 , @entity9 boy from walking , playing with friends and essentially living a normal life – he ’s been rushed to the hospital by ambulance at least 40 times			1
to combat the disease , @entity2 was prescribed 12 different medications that he has to take every day			2
in all , the boy takes 22 pills a day			1
miracle : before 6 - year - old @entity2 started treating his epilepsy with marijuana , he could n't even walk up stairs ‘ at one point @entity2 had seizures 24 hours a day lasting an hour and a half , ’ @entity2 ’s father , @entity24 , told @entity25			1
‘ i went to my doctor and said , “ i do n't think @entity2 is going to last , he ca n't sleep , ca n't eat , he has n't used the restroom , he ca n't do anything			0
” ’ at one point , the debilitating disease got so bad for his son that @entity24 said he considered killing himself			0
as a last resort , @entity24 opted to try a liquid form of marijuana to treat @entity2 ’s seizures			1
‘ ( the ) first day i gave him medical marijuana , thank @entity42			2
( it was ) the first day he went seizure free in his life , ’ @entity24 said			0
@entity2 's father , @entity24 , said he considered suicide because he was so distraught over his son 's rare condition the marijuana used to treat @entity2 ’s seizures contains a component called @entity51 ( cannabidiol ) that provides the same medical qualities as normal marijuana , but with less of a high			1
@entity2 has been getting a few drops of the @entity51 a day for the last two years , and his father says the results have been nothing short of remarkable – he plays , he can walk up and down stairs and he even gives his dad high - fives			0
the pediatrician who prescribes the boy with the medical marijuana said he ’s seeing a spike in children with autism and seizures benefitting from medical marijuana			2
in many cases , it works when other medications fail			0
prescription pot : @entity2 's pediatrician says he 's seeing a spike in parents opting to treat epileptic or autistic children with marijuana @entity24 says he wants to share his story to encourage other parents in similar situations to do what they think is best for their children – even if that means using medical marijuana			1
@entity2 ’s paediatrician admits that there have n’t been many studies conducted to determine the medicinal benefits of marijuana , which is why doctors have differing opinions about whether it should be used to treat certain diseases			2
currently , however , researchers at the @entity96 currently are studying the affects @entity51 has on epileptic children			0
@entity2 and his father will be featured in a @entity100 special by dr. @entity101 that examines the benefits of medical marijuana			1
