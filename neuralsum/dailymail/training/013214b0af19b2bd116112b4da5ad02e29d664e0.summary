@entity1 's 65th birthday celebration finally went off with a bang on wednesday night			2
when @entity5 hit the hugely unlikely 90th - minute winner here , frustrated @entity4 fans threw an exploding firework on the pitch			1
it was an act of extreme recklessness but doubtless caused by utter frustration and disbelief in the @entity13			2
as a knot of @entity17 players celebrated their unlikely saviour in @entity19 in front of their travelling fans in one corner of the ground , all around there was a sense of incredulity			1
for 88 minutes @entity4 , the @entity26 champions , had not just held @entity17 at bay ; in the second half they had dominated them			1
they were were well worth their 71st - minute opener , set up by the excellent @entity31 , once a @entity33 trialist , and finished at the near post by @entity35			1

not only that , they should have finished @entity17 off			1
it was @entity75 , the 22 - year - old goalkeeper on whom so much pressure had been placed , who kept them in the game , making a string of saves , notably from @entity67 on 84 minutes			2
and it was the post that rescued them from an @entity104 chip on 80 minutes			0
@entity17 were creaking , the limitations of this squad seemingly exposed for all @entity107 to see , as were their pretensions as challengers for this trophy			1
but something curious has happened to @entity17 this season ; the spirit that once characterised this side has returned			1
their late comebacks are becoming a regular feature of games			0
this , though , topped the lot			0
@entity1 , understated as ever , took the dramatic last two minutes completely in his stride			0
‘ it ’s a bit unexpected to take the three points , considering the quality of the match that @entity4 played tonight , ’ said @entity1 , his lips curling into the beginnings of a grin			1
‘ i know by experience that the last five minutes in the @entity53 , the nerves play a part			1
and that we had to get into these five minutes without conceding the second goal			0
’ ‘ a bit unexpected ’ was stretching it			0
when @entity136 advanced into @entity4 ’s half in the 89th minute there had barely been a significant @entity17 chance since @entity83 forced a 64th - minute save from @entity56			1
but @entity76 , who had endured a troubled night , redeemed himself : his cross was superb , the finish from @entity78 , at the far post and drilled across goal , even better			1
that in itself would have represented something remarkable			0
just over a minute later substitute @entity80 advanced goalwards , with @entity4 complaining bitterly of a foul			1
his pass found @entity48 , who shot , and amid a rebound and something of a scramble , up popped perennial reserve @entity19 to record the most improbable victory ‘ we always know he can score , ’ said @entity1 , denying that his @entity157 @entity156 winner had been close to leaving in the summer due to his lack of appearances			1
@entity78 started and finished his first @entity53 goal			1

but he ’s important as well and he showed that tonight and he will be important in the coming months			0
it took him a while to get back to a good physical level after the @entity156 and now he ’s nearly there			0
‘ he has 115 caps for @entity44 ; that is not a coincidence , that shows you the quality			0
i think he is a guy you want to have the ball in the box			0
his shot is fantastic , his accuracy is great and he has very short backlift			0
’ there was praise too for @entity75 , very impressive since it was his third @entity17 appearance			1
i had no worry for our goalkeeper because he has the presence and the quality and he resists stress well			0
for the rest ? there was little to say			0
‘ we had the spirit , ’ said @entity1			0
‘ it was disappointing we did n’t create more chances tonight but i put that down to the fact as well that @entity4 defended very well			1
' prior to that spectacular ending , @entity1 ’s birthday celebrations were proving very flat in @entity51			1
it was as though all the invited guests turned up but there was no cake , an absence of party poppers and definitely no champagne @entity221 of old , with which we associate @entity1 , went missing			0
@entity35 was unmarked as he fired a bullet header past the diving @entity75 , the goalkeeper making his @entity17 bow @entity35 celebrates his shock goal against @entity17 and is only the second @entity229 to score in the @entity53 @entity78 finished with aplomb in the final minutes of the @entity53 clash to haul his side level the defender sinks to his knees and is congratulated by @entity235 after scoring his first goal in the @entity53 a solid @entity4 side , who made up in endeavour what they lacked in quality , were too much for the visitors			1
the first half was a rum affair , neither side displaying much quality other than on the defensive side			0
the second started more promisingly			0
@entity65 almost provided @entity17 with the unpleasant shock on 48 minutes			1
mertesacker mistakenly let the ball run across the box and @entity65 found himself with time and space to shoot			0
his strike was deflected wide but it was enough to lift the @entity4 crowd , who increasingly believed they had the measure of the @entity260 side			2
their cause gathered momentum when @entity31 , increasingly influential , had space to play in @entity65 down the left on 53 minutes			0
@entity76 seemed to react slowly and for a moment the 23 - year - old @entity4 winger looked as though he had the measure of @entity17 ’s right back , and was poised to beat him as @entity76 struggled back			1
ultimately @entity76 came out on top , winning the ball back cleanly , despite penalty appeals from his opponents			0
@entity17 could muster precious little in response			2
@entity48 again got clear on 55 minutes and pulled back a cross but @entity81 fired his effort well wide			2
@entity83 then burst free on 64 minutes but was blocked by @entity278 with @entity48 lifting the rebound over			0
after that there was little more , until that finish			0
at least it can be said they saved the real celebration until last			0
@entity1 turned 65 on wednesday and handed a start to @entity75 - the 22 - year - old filling in for @entity287 the travelling @entity17 supporters appeared in good voice during the @entity291 clash in @entity26 the home fans respond to the vocal support from the visiting end			2
@entity4 have been champions for the last three seasons in @entity26 like our @entity296 here .			2

substitute @entity19 converted from close range in the 90th minute as @entity17 claimed all three points in @entity51
the @entity33 were heading for a shock loss after @entity35 opened the scoring for @entity4 in the 71st minute
but @entity78 converted a @entity136 cross in the 89th minute before @entity19 struck
the win spares @entity17 's *blushes* with @entity4 considered among the @entity53 *minnows*
