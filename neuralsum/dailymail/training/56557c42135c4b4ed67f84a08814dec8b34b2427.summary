to blame ? an article in the @entity1 suggests it is @entity2 's fault that staff at the @entity4 were able to breach security by looking at porn on @entity8 computers it was revealed this month that the @entity10 had ordered staff at its top - secret missile defence unit to stop watching porn on @entity15 government computers			1
but rather than the porn - cruising culprits at the @entity4 coming under fire for the massive security breach , president @entity2 is getting the blame			1
in an article for the @entity1 , @entity20 linked the agency ’s porn habits with the @entity26 ’s @entity25 prostitute scandal before relating both to a problem with @entity2 ’s leadership			1
‘ the @entity30 scandal was the president ’s wake - up call			1
the @entity33 needed to order an in - depth and urgent investigation into porn , child porn and prostitution in all government agencies			2
mr. @entity2 did no such thing			0
‘ now @entity15 ’s @entity4 may be exposing the core of our national security , ’ @entity20 , a professor at @entity42 's @entity41 , wrote on friday			2
the article traces the government ’s ‘ porn problem ’ back to 2006 when a deputy press secretary for the @entity48 was arrested for trying to seduce someone he thought was a teenage girl online			2
the piece then highlights a 2010 report by the @entity56 which found that 17 of 31 employees caught accessing porn at work since 2008 were senior staff			0
@entity20 also recalls 2010 ’s revelations that @entity10 staff were accessing child porn			0
‘ @entity15 ’s most professional security officials [ … ] seem eager to discredit themselves			0
during the @entity67 , they had to train and deploy real female agents			0
today , @entity15 come freely to honey pots directly from the @entity10 ’s missile - defence system , ’ he writes			2
the recent violation at the @entity4 came to light after fears were raised that viruses may have already been smuggled into the department 's mainframe through x-rated sites			1
security breach : the @entity10 's defence chiefs are understood to have been furious upon hearing that some staff members had accessed websites ' known to have had virus and malware issues ' an internal probe then found that some staff had been downloading adult material on office computers and sharing them with each other via the internal network			1
it constitutes a massive security risk to one of @entity15 's most secretive agencies because porn sites provide perfect cover for criminals and foreign spies to sneak snooping software past even the most sophisticated of firewalls			1
not the job in hand : the @entity4 workers should have been developing rockets like this @entity105 rather than looking at pornography in a bid to curb the abuse , the agency 's executive director sent a stern memo warning staff that ' appropriate disciplinary action ' would be dished out to anyone caught surfing the net for smut			1
' there have been instances of employees and contractors accessing websites , or transmitting messages , containing pornographic or sexually explicit images , ' @entity117 wrote in the july 27 memo leaked to @entity126			0
' these actions are not only unprofessional , they reflect time taken away from designated duties , are in clear violation of federal and @entity10 and regulations , consume network resources and can compromise the security of the network though the introduction of malware or malicious code , he wrote			0
' he added that anyone caught misusing the agency 's network will face losing their security clearance and could be suspended , even fired			2
@entity4 spokesman @entity145 told @entity126 that the memo was written after ' a few people ' downloaded material ' from some websites that were known to have had virus and malware issues '			2
one government cybersecurity expert , who wished to remain anonymous , said criminal gangs and foreign intelligence agencies , such as @entity66 , embed spyware deep within the coding of pornographic websites in a bid to access and harvest confidential data from governments and corporations			0
such sites contain high - quality images and videos that contain complex computer coding - the ideal place to hide viruses			0
the @entity4 is responsible for developing , fielding and upgrading the nation ’s ground - and sea - based missile defense programs			1
inside the heart of defence : the revelation constitutes a massive security risk because pornographic sites provide perfect cover for criminals and foreign spies to smuggle spying software past even the most sophisticated of firewalls ( stock image ) it works closely with countries including @entity185 and @entity186 as well as companies such as @entity188 and @entity189 in july last year , @entity15 vowed to retaliate with military force against countries that sabotage its computers in the @entity10 ’s first ever strategy on how to fight escalating cyber attacks			1
anxious to contend with growing internet incursions linked to @entity66 and @entity196 , @entity15 military chiefs reportedly agreed that the most serious sabotage attempts should constitute an act of war			0
the document was designed to tackle a changing world in which computer hackers could cripple @entity15 ’s financial markets or public transport systems .			0
