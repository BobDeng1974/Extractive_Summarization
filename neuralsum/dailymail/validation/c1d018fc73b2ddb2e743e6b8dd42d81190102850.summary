professor @entity0 was sacked from his job as the @entity4 @entity3 's chief adviser on drugs after saying saying ecstasy and lsd were less harmful than alcohol a @entity4 scientist trying to reveal what the human brain looks like on @entity7 is asking the public to fund his research after official channels refused			1
in the controversial study , 20 @entity4 volunteers will be the first in the world to have their brains scanned while high on lsd			2
early results are said to be ' exciting ' but the full findings must wait until funding can be found to complete the research			1
the research , being conducted at @entity25 , is being led by the former drugs tsar @entity0			1
professor @entity0 was sacked from his job as the government 's chief adviser on drugs in 2009 after saying saying ecstasy and lsd were less harmful than alcohol			1
at a briefing in @entity32 this week , he spoke out against restrictions on research on recreational drugs which he called ' the worst censorship in the history of science '			1
having been turned down by ' classic funders ' , he is now campaigning to raise the Â£ 25,000 needed to carry out analysis of the brain scanning data from the science crowdfunding site @entity44			1
he compared current attitudes to studying recreational drugs with the @entity48 's clampdown on pioneering @entity51 astronomer @entity49 in the 17th century			1
' the only comparable example is when the @entity48 banned the telescope in 1616 , ' said professor @entity0 , who is based at @entity54			1
' we 've banned research on psychedelic drugs and other drugs like cannabis for 50 years			2
' truly in terms of the amount of wasted opportunity , it 's way greater than the banning of the telescope			2
this is a truly appalling level of censorship			0
' the lsd study involved giving the volunteers injections of a 75 microgram dose of lsd before probing the activity of their brains			2
two kinds of scans were used , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity75 ) and magnetoencephalography ( @entity77 ) , which measures small magnetic fields generated in the brain			2
none of the participants reported having a bad experience , but three described some anxiety and temporary paranoia			0
dr @entity87 , also from the @entity54 team , said the dose of @entity7 given to the volunteers was a ' tiny speck '			2
but he added : ' the effects are quite profound			0
it would be described as a moderate dose , but a moderate dose of @entity7 can still produce a profound state of consciousness			2
in the controversial study , 20 @entity4 volunteers will be the first in the world to have their brains scanned while high on lsd ' i would n't say that it 's a dangerous experiment , but i would say that @entity7 has potential negative effects			1
' probably the crucial one is a bad trip			0
it 's not uncommon for people to have anxiety during a psychedelic drug experience			0
. the experience can be nightmarish at times			0
' what 's especially intriguing			0
. is that people can have a very challenging experience yet afterwards they seem to be somehow psychologically refreshed by the experience			0
that 's how they describe it			0
' he said there had been no evidence of psychedelic drugs such as lsd triggering psychosis in research studies , although there were anecdotal reports of this occurring through recreational use			1
professor @entity0 said lsd was widely studied in the 1950s and 1960s and shown to be therapeutically useful in treating ' many conditions ' , in particular alcoholism			1
since it was made illegal in 1967 it had only been the subject of one clinical study in @entity135 and two neuroscience studies			0
' that is an absurd amount of censorship , ' professor @entity0 added			1
he stood by the claim that got him into trouble with the government - that psychoactive drugs such as ecstasy and lsd were considerably less harmful than alcohol			1
' interesting drugs that we 've been researching like @entity149 ( ecstasy ) and @entity7 , are relatively low in terms of harms , considerably less even than cannabis and very much less than alcohol , ' he said			1
' but no research is done on them			0
' the law is actually wrong			0
the law is supposed to be based on evidence of harm but is n't			0
' he maintained that the risks of taking @entity7 had been ' massively exaggerated ' by the @entity160 and @entity161			2
initial funding for the @entity7 study came from @entity54 and the @entity164 , which promotes drug policy reform and research into the medical benefits of psychoactive substances			1
professor @entity0 said @entity7 ( a molecule of the drug is pictured ) was widely studied in the 1950s and 1960s and shown to be therapeutically useful in treating ' many conditions ' , in particular alcoholism professor @entity0 said he approached the @entity175 and @entity176 for the outstanding funding to no avail			1
' the issue always comes ' well look , these are recreational drugs ' , and the recreational label is so powerful i think it scares people off , ' he said			0
' i personally think the neuroscience that 's been uncovered by these drugs is revolutionary			2
' this research is so important it should be funded to the tune of millions			0
' dr @entity87 said : ' this is the first @entity7 brain imaging study that 's ever been conducted			1
' we think it 's essentially important to understand how these drugs that are widely used and seem to have this therapeutic potential work in the brain			1
once we 've done that , we want to look at how these drugs can be put to good use			0
' a previous brain scanning study was carried out by the same team on volunteers under the influence of the magic mushroom active ingredient psilocybin			0
it showed that the drug affected the brain 's ' hub structure ' and led to more connections between regions that are not normally linked			2
this , it is thought , may have a bearing on creative thinking			0
in may , the team is planning a study , funded by the @entity175 , looking at how psilocybin might be helpful in treating depression .			0
