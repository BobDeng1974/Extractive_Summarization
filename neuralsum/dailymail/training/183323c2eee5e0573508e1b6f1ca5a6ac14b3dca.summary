when @entity1 smashed @entity3 ’s third into the top corner of the @entity6 goal to crown last season ’s 3 - 0 victory , @entity0 spun on his heels , sickened			1
he had also just identified his first summer signing			0
four months later , @entity1 was joining his hometown club on a free transfer			1
the bitter @entity3 tweeted a picture of his celebration at @entity15 and a statement was released expressing their ‘ dismay ’ at his decision to quit the club who had ‘ nurtured him ’			1
@entity1 and his new employers kept their counsel			2
the 25 - year - old is the feature interview in tomorrow ’s matchday programme and the cover carries an artist ’s drawing of the black - and - white - clad midfielder with his hand on his heart			0
@entity1 joined @entity33 on a free transfer this summer after leaving @entity3 midfielder @entity1 ( centre ) has impressed since during his early @entity33 career an illustration of @entity1 with his hand on his heart will be on the front cover of @entity33 's programme the @entity33 players are put through their paces during @entity33 's friday morning training session behind him rests a snow - covered @entity45			1
@entity33 ’s message is clear : @entity1 ’s back home			1
@entity0 has added to @entity3 ’s sense of loss by admitting that @entity1 's man - of - the - match showing on @entity51 was the motivating factor behind their summer steal			1
‘ @entity1 ’s performance in the derby was one of the reasons i signed him , ’ he said			2
‘ the way he played on those big occasions told me a lot about the player			2
when i like a player and he performs in the big games it ticks a lot of boxes for me			2
‘ he has been a major thorn in our side in these fixtures so i 'm just pleased he 's not playing for @entity3 if i 'm honest			2
’ the @entity74 boss added : ‘ i think he feels a bit aggrieved about the way it ended at @entity3			2
‘ but i think he 's handled the move impeccably because he took a bit of criticism after it and he did n't respond , which i think is the right thing			0
@entity0 has added extra spice to the @entity85 by praising @entity1 's performances this season @entity0 will be hoping to end his run of three successive defeats against @entity3 @entity1 made 135 appearances for the @entity3 scoring five goals , including against @entity33 last season ‘ his performances for us have been fantastic			1
he has grown in terms of having a different role here			0
i could n't be more delighted with him and i 'm sure @entity96 would mirror that			0
’ does , then , @entity99 mirror that affection ? ‘ he helped me a lot and i will remember that and i wish him well , ’ said the @entity3 head coach			1
‘ tomorrow ( sunday ) , i hope he has a stinker			2
but his character shows that he could have a special game			0
‘ my first few games here when i started playing him in the middle of midfield – they ’d been playing him left - back – he got man - of - the - match and was stood there with a big bottle of champagne – he was enjoying it			0
‘ of course , i would be happier for him now if he was somewhere else			0
it was a massive decision he took			0
’ @entity1 spent 14 years on the books at @entity3 and made his first team debut in 2009 @entity1 will come up against his former team - mates for the first time on sunday @entity33 have come a long way since a legion of @entity125 players led to their manager being dubbed @entity127 last season			1
@entity0 could start five @entity33 in the @entity85 tomorrow , their most ever in the @entity129			1
@entity3 , on the other hand , are likely to field only one local lad — @entity3 - born @entity132			2
@entity133 born in @entity134 to a @entity33 family and relocated to the @entity136 just weeks after his birth			2
joined the esteemed @entity138 before joining @entity33 ’s youth academy			1
@entity140 while older brother and former @entity33 man @entity143 was born in @entity144 , @entity141 was born and bred in @entity33			2
he joined @entity74 ’s academy in july 2008 and within three months had featured for the reserves			0
@entity147 the defender joined @entity33 aged eight and worked his way through the academy , captaining the reserves on several occasions			1
after loans at @entity156 and @entity157 , @entity154 made his breakthrough last season			0
@entity160 is set to be one of five local lads in the @entity33 starting line - up on sunday @entity164 born in @entity165 , just outside @entity33 , @entity160 did not head straight for his local club			2
with big brother @entity167 at @entity3 , @entity160 followed suit before swapping for rivals @entity33 in 2008			1
@entity1 another to take the long road to @entity33			1
the midfielder spent his formative years progressing through @entity3 ’s youth academy but joined @entity33 on a free in june after his contract had expired			1
@entity99 , though , remains upset by @entity1 ’s defection			1
and , in what could be considered a sly attempt to cast doubt over the player ’s decision , he questioned the wider perception that @entity33 is a bigger club than @entity3			1
‘ from the outside , for some reason , @entity33 are apparently a bigger club than @entity3 , but when you are here , you realise there is no difference , ’ he said			1
‘ maybe it ’s because of the publicity @entity33 gets , the city centre or maybe even the airport , @entity3 does not have one			1
‘ it is easier to talk about @entity33 than @entity3			1
’ talk will turn to @entity3 , however , should they win a fourth straight derby for the first time in the fixture ’s history			2
@entity99 said he hopes his former player @entity1 has a ' stinker ' on sunday @entity99 said that he would prefer it if @entity1 was playing for a different team @entity99 , with two victories of his own , has certainly absorbed the sense of separation in the region			1
‘ i agree with @entity204 because you have to live it to know it , ’ he said of the rivalry			0
‘ it is the cities			0
mostly derbies are teams from the same city or two teams from different ones , really far away			0
we are near , almost connected to each other , but very different			0
so close , yet unique			0
and the passion is really special			0
’ there has been an effort by both clubs to channel such passion onto the pitch , as opposed to vitriol in the stands and on the streets			0
@entity0 is cheered by the progress in this respect			2
rather , his concerns lie with one of his players			0
@entity133 once said that no @entity3 player would get in @entity33 ’s side and has been a target of supporters who once sang , ‘ @entity133 , we wish you were dead ’			1
@entity99 's @entity3 did the doule over @entity33 last season , including a 3 - 0 win at @entity15 manager @entity99 insists that @entity33 are not a bigger club than his @entity3 @entity133 , who was sent off in his last home game against @entity245 , has already been called into the manager ’s office for a quiet word			1
‘ i will be looking at one or two who maybe get emotionally involved , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ probably the one who worries me the most is @entity133			0
he wears his heart on his sleeve and he plays like that sometimes in this fixture			0
‘ i 've spoken to him about it			0
i think this time around he will be a lot calmer and if he plays he will be in better shape ( to deal with the emotion )			0
’ @entity3 have their own firebrand in the form of @entity260 , who was red carded on his last appearance at @entity15 ’			1
@entity0 said he has had a word with @entity133 about keeping his emotions in check on sunday @entity265 keeps himself warm with a personalised snood during the session @entity99 , though , feels that characters such as @entity133 and @entity260 define the intensity of the derby			1
‘ we normally try to motivate players but it is with a limit			0
characters like @entity133 and @entity260 , sometimes you need to bring them down , ’ he said			0
‘ but it ’s all part of this game , if @entity133 and @entity260 were n’t there it would be a different game			0
it would be too soft – they add to the occasion			0
’ with @entity0 and @entity99 , @entity260 and @entity133 , and not forgetting @entity1 , there is certainly no doubting the sense of occasion this time .			1
