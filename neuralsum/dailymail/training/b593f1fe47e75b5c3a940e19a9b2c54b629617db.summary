forget love and companionship , for one in six men a relationship is dependent on performance between the sheets - and they would leave a partner who failed to satisfy them in bed			1
hitting the spot is so important to one in four men and one in five women that they rate having regular orgasms more highly than being in love			1
but despite how important their sex lives are to their relationships , less than half of @entity18 admitted they were ' very happy ' with how often they orgasm in a recent survey conducted by online retailer bondara.co.uk			1
it 's over : 39 per cent of @entity23 said failing to reach an orgasm with their partner would be a contributory factor in a break - up they quizzed 3800 @entity18 men and women and found that 16 per cent of men and 10 per cent of women would end a loving relationship if they failed to reach an orgasm with their partner , with a further 39 per cent of men and women stating it would be a contributory factor			1
although 60 per cent said they were ' very happy ' when asked to rate their relationship in general , this figure fell by 17 per cent for men and 6 per cent for women when asked to rate the sexual side of their relationship			1
when asked what affected their ability to reach orgasm , tiredness was the most common cause with 20 per cent of women and 23 per cent of men			1
self - esteem issues ranked second for women followed by ' lack of sexual desire '			2
for 15 per cent of men , hitting the booze caused a problem in the bedroom as being drunk prevented them from climaxing , while job worries affect 12 per cent of men			2
one in four of those surveyed stated they felt under pressure to reach orgasm every time they have sex			0
as a result 27 per cent of men and 69 per cent of women have at some point faked an orgasm			1
under pressure : one in four said they felt they had to reach an orgasm every time they had sex , leading to 69 per cent of women faking it at least once @entity88 , sex expert for @entity89 , said couples should try not to get so ' hung up ' on achieving an orgasm			1
she said : ' while having an orgasm is a wonderful part of sex , making love can still be enjoyable without the big ' o '			0
' try not to get too hung up on it as this will only make the situation worse			0
the ability to have an orgasm is affected by many factors as this survey shows , to be at your sexual peak keep healthy , try not to get overtired and avoid too much alcohol			0
' ms @entity88 added that the old adage of ' never going to bed on an argument ' is true if you want a fulfilling sex life and couples should n't be afraid to talk to one another about issues between the sheets			0
' misunderstandings and conflicts can all affect your sexual life ; it is hard to feel carefree and orgasm when you are conflicted or angry with your partner			2
if you 're having difficulties talk about them and try to resolve them , leaving you freer to relax and enjoy your sex life , ' she said			0
@entity125 conducted their research to mark next week 's ' @entity128 ' and asked respondents worked for them in the bedroom			0
relax : sex expert @entity88 said couples should have more fun and not get hung up on achieving the ' big o ' for 47 per cent of women , spending more time on foreplay made a difference as well as more oral sex ( 38 per cent ) and introducing sex toys ( 35 per cent )			2
for men , more oral sex ( 54 per cent ) was a must , followed by spending more time on foreplay ( 43 per cent ) , introducing sex toys ( 42 per cent ) and changing sexual positions ( 38 per cent )			2
a separate survey by @entity148 revealed how the sex lives of @entity23 varies around the country			0
they found that men from the @entity153 , aged between 25 - 34 , who are in a relationship and have sex several times a week , fake an orgasm more regularly than sexually active , male singletons			1
men from the @entity153 ( 17 per cent ) are also most likely to fake it compared to @entity161 men ( 8 per cent ) and those who reside in the @entity163 ( 2 per cent )			0
meanwhile , women who live in @entity165 ( 6 per cent ) , @entity166 ( 6 per cent ) and the @entity163 ( 5 per cent ) are less likely to fake an orgasm than their southern counterparts , as the survey revealed that women from @entity153 ( 18 per cent ) and @entity171 ( 10 per cent ) are the biggest fakers			1
their poll of 500 people found that when it comes to having the most orgasms â€“ single men have it the best , with only 14 per cent admitting to faking it compared to 50 per cent of those in a loving relationship			0
in contrast for women , married life equals more orgasms , as only 12 per cent pretend in bed compared to 28 per cent of singletons .			0

for 39 per cent of @entity23 , *inability* to orgasm with their partner would contribute to a break - up
less than half were ' very happy ' with how often they climax
69 per cent of women and 27 per cent of men have faked it
