when two complete strangers living just an hour apart in @entity2 discovered they looked so alike they could be identical twins this week , the world was shocked			1
but unlikely as it may seem , @entity3 , 26 , and @entity4 , 29 , are n't the only pair to have found their real - life doppelgängers , either by mistake or after a social media hunt			1
now three similar @entity11 cases have been revealed ; a @entity14 - based journalist who found hers in @entity16 , two male university students , also in @entity14 , and two retired men in @entity18			1
' @entity25 ' turned out to be @entity25 , a 74 - year - old former head teacher who was well - known to the town , and just so happened to look exactly like mr @entity22			1
upon meeting , the pair , who are both grandfathers - of - four now living just 150 yards apart , also realised that as well as being doppelgängers , they had an awful lot in common			1
both had attended the same college , and both became @entity42 teachers and choir singers			2
the pair finally came face - to - face in march when they coincidentally both boarded the same coach for a @entity47 visit to the @entity49 exhibition at the @entity50			1
' it was quite spooky , ' said mr @entity25 , adding that they ' hit it off immediately ' and are now friends			0
' my only worry is the number of people who probably think i 've been ignoring them when they 've been saying " @entity59 " to @entity22 all this time			0
' upon meeting , mr @entity22 ( left ) and mr @entity25 ( right ) , who are both grandfathers - of - four now living just 150 yards apart , also realised they had a lot in common in terms of their life stories mr @entity22 married his wife in 1968 ( left ) while mr @entity25 also married wife @entity67 in the sixties ( right ) in 2011 , @entity70 - born journalist @entity69 became fascinated by the idea that there might be someone out there in the world who looked exactly like her			1
in fact , she was the inspiration behind @entity79 's ultimately successful social media search			0
in much the same way , ms @entity69 launched her mission to find her doppelgänger by publicising it on @entity84 , @entity85 , and through blogs around the world			1
and just like @entity79 , it turned out that ms @entity69 did n't need to look that far			1
her closest match turned out to be @entity16 native @entity90 , who worked in the film industry and shared a mutual friend			1
@entity70 - born journalist @entity69 ( right ) launched a hunt to find her ' twin stranger ' in 2011 and found @entity16 native @entity90 ( left ) through a mutual friend after seeing ms @entity90 's photo , miss @entity69 set up a meeting in @entity98 in @entity14 , and the rest is history			1
and in another accidental result , doppelgängers @entity102 and @entity103 , both based in @entity14 , got to know each other at university			1
as cases of mistaken identity around the campus began to mount up , the pair met , again though mutual acquaintances , and ultimately became firm friends			2
@entity114 @entity102 ( left ) and @entity103 ( right ) , both based in @entity14 , got to know each other at @entity116 , after friends kept getting them confused when mr @entity103 married his then - girlfriend @entity120 a little while later , several members of his family approached @entity121 at the wedding to congratulate him			1
all this comes after @entity79 and miss @entity4 's story blew up across the media yesterday , for being the most twin - like case yet			1
miss @entity3 , a tv presenter , found @entity127 after she teamed up with two friends to launch a project called @entity130			2
this is the moment that @entity79 ( right ) met her doppleganger @entity127 ( left ) for the first time ' i was ridiculously nervous about how i would react to meeting someone who looks like me ' @entity79 ( right ) said about @entity127 ( left ) the aim of the social media experiment was to see which of the three could find their closest lookalike within 28 days and it attracted submissions to their website @entity141 from across the world			0
incredibly , miss @entity3 found @entity127 in just two weeks - just an hour away			1
after their first meeting she said : ‘ i was ridiculously nervous about how i would react to meeting someone who looks like me			0
' for the duration of our encounter i pretty much stared at her			0
i could n’t get over her face			0
‘ and some of the expressions she would pull i would think to myself or say aloud , “ @entity152 that ’s my face ”			0
i ca n’t remember the number of times i said “ this is so freaky ”			0
uncanny : miss @entity3 , a 26 - year - old student from @entity26 ( left ) , found her ' twin stranger ' in @entity158 ( right ) , through a social media campaign she launched with friends ‘ i would say @entity4 is the shyer of the two of us , ’ said miss @entity3			1
‘ but then you have to remember this was an even more surreal experience for her than it was for me			0
i ’m the weirdo that contacted @entity4 and asked her to meet me			2
’ miss @entity4 , who is currently in between jobs , has five sisters and a brother			2
miss @entity3 has two sisters and a brother , and both girls agree that none of their siblings look anywhere near as similar to them as they do to one another			0
since meeting , miss @entity180 and @entity127 - who are both single - say they 've been chatting on @entity84 ' constantly '			2
miss @entity4 ( right ) turned out to be a fellow @entity2 native who lived just an hour down the road from @entity79 ( left ) , making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin - like photos together she added , ' some of the expressions she would pull i would think to myself or say aloud , " @entity191 that ’s my face " ' while miss @entity3 appears to have beaten her fellow @entity194 participants , 21 - year - old @entity195 and 22 - year - old @entity196 , hands down , the search is n't over until april 27			1
' i think i have a two , maybe three at a push who resemble me			0
but they 're definitely not as close a match as @entity4 to @entity3 , ' @entity199 said			2
' i 'm trailing further behind , ' admits @entity202			0
' must be a guy thing			0
they tend to be a bit too shy to participate			0
not sure if being originally from @entity206 has anything to do with it ! ' miss @entity3 ( right ) said she and @entity127 ( left ) got on ' very well ' as they both applied make - up before the shoot , swapping beauty tips and marvelling at their similarities ( pictured ) friends for life ? since meeting , @entity79 ( right ) and @entity127 ( left ) - who are both single - say they 've been chatting on @entity84 ' constantly ' feedback : shocked reactions to their story have flooded in from far and wide challenge : miss @entity3 's ( right ) fellow @entity194 participants , 21 - year - old @entity195 ( left ) and 22 - year - old @entity196 ( centre ) , are still looking for their doppelgängers , and the search is n't over until april 27 miss @entity3 , who is still promoting the project across social media with @entity195 and @entity196 as interest spreads , says there will be no prize for the winner , just ' pride '			2
they are inviting others from around the world to join in too now , by adding users ' photos to their @entity84 album			0
' there is a huge human curiosity element to it , ' she said			0
' can you imagine how surreal it would be to meet someone who looked exactly like you ? '			0
