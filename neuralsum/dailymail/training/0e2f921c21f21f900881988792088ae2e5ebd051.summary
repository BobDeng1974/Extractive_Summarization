the last time the @entity0 wowed a @entity2 crowd quite like they did at the @entity3 on saturday night was when they played the @entity5 opening ceremony in @entity6			1
that , at any rate , was the joke doing the rounds on @entity11 late on saturday , not that you could find anyone at @entity3 making cracks about superannuated rock stars			1
@entity16 might be a knight of the realm who turns 70 this month , and @entity20 might now sport something resembling an old man ’s paunch , but they , @entity27 and @entity28 ( at 66 , the baby of the band , and also the new boy , having joined as recently as 1975 ) , put on a show that the teenagers in the audience will tell their grandchildren about			1
front man @entity16 ( second left ) turns 70 this month and @entity28 ( left ) is the baby of the band at 66 who are you calling grandad ? @entity16 's ostentatious dancing dominated the electrifying performance the grandparents in the audience – and there were plenty of them , too – probably already have			1
@entity3 has hosted lots of huge headline acts in the 43 years since @entity55 , the first of them , set foot a little gingerly on @entity60 ’s dairy farm			1
the admission in 1970 was £ 1 , which included free milk from @entity60 ’s herd			1
tickets now cost over £ 200 , and if you want to drink milk , you buy your own			1
in the intervening years , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 have all performed there			2
but never the @entity0 , making this the headline act of all headline acts , before a euphoric crowd of more than 170,000			1
not even @entity3 had seen anything like it			2
by the time the band came on at around 9.45pm , a circus contortionist would have been hard pressed to get within 500 yards of the festival ’s main pyramid stage			2
beforehand , as a glorious @entity83 day cooled to dusk , there was almost as much apprehension as excitement among festival - goers			2
could the @entity0 , with an aggregate age of 276 , possibly live up to their own mythology ? squeezed next to me , so close that we had to synchronise our jigging like a pair of middle - aged backing singers , was a retired businessman from @entity96 , @entity97 , who first saw the @entity0 at the @entity100 pub in @entity101 , @entity102 , in 1963			2
he saw them again at the famous gig in @entity105 in 1969 , two days after the sudden death of @entity107 , but this was the first time since			2
could they possibly be as good as he remembered ? stamina : @entity16 's dynamic performance lasted more than two hours and made some of his fellow band mates look tired timeless : @entity28 and @entity20 entertained teenagers , parents and grandparents on saturday night mature : there was no disguising @entity28 ( left ) and @entity20 's ( right ) advanced years as they put in a historic performance on the @entity3 they were better			1
in part , because the amplification is so much more sophisticated now			2
but also because when these elderly men take the stage , the years drop away as if spirited by a @entity128 - loving genie			2
close up , of course , there ’s no disguising their age			0
@entity133 looks bizarrely as if he could be @entity135 ’s raddled grandfather , while @entity27 , the drummer , his grey hair politely coiffed , looks like everyone ’s auntie @entity139			0
throughout , like auntie @entity139 at a family party , he wore a benign half - smile and seemed relieved to be sitting down			0
as for @entity28 , there are pickled walnuts less wrinkly			0
but none of these men got where they were on saturday , without incredible musical machismo and supreme stagecraft			0
and then there is @entity16			1
he pranced , he strutted , he pouted , he bounced , sometimes like a glorious parody of himself , but at all times with the manic energy and enthusiasm of the teenager he has n’t been for half a century			0
@entity157 : @entity20 looked tired at times but enjoyed solo moments that displayed his renowned guitar skills off to their best enthusiasm : @entity16 sings as powerfully and charismatically as ever and struts and prances with the attitude ( and figure ) of a teenager it was a genuinely remarkable performance , made possible by a metabolism – or maybe it ’s a starvation diet – that keeps him as skinny and narrow - hipped as a boy			1
the celebrated lips have become the emblem of the @entity0 , but it could just as easily be the schoolboy hips			0
at the end of a set lasting well over two hours , which began and ended with two of their greatest crowd - pleasers , @entity177 ’ @entity174 and ( @entity178 , @entity16 looked as if he was ready for more			1
@entity133 , by contrast , looked as if he was ready for a warm malted drink and a nurse			0
if a lifetime of drug abuse has n’t undermined his stamina , maybe the increasing girth finally has			0
the poor old boy looked paunch - drunk			0
onstage at @entity3 , sir @entity188 , 85 , teased the @entity0			0
imitating @entity16 ’s stage gestures , the veteran star joked : ‘ i ’m glad the boys did well			1
i mean , they ’re just kids			0
’ how does @entity16 manage it ? his fellow knight @entity67 has been rather found out in recent years , the passing decades having reduced his more melodic voice to an unconvincing waver			1
but @entity16 shouts just as powerfully , tunefully and charismatically as he always did			1
his @entity197 has stood the acid tests of time and of audience appreciation			0
much has been made of @entity16 ’s comment to @entity202 on the today programme earlier on saturday , that he would have found it ‘ gratifying ’ to have had a career as a schoolteacher			1
certainly , it is irresistible to think of all those teachers who have fantasised about being rock stars , playing air guitar with their slide - rules , suddenly learning that , all the while , the @entity0 front man would have rather been wielding a board duster than a microphone			0
but he was surely being disingenuous			0
how marvellous it must be to send away today ’s teenagers , convinced they have just attended the ultimate rock concert , having once chalked up the same distinction with their parents and perhaps even grandparents			0
could it be , indeed , that there is a generation of fans now in their push - chairs who will yet get to see the @entity0 live ? nobody who was at @entity3 on saturday , or who watched on television , would bet against it .			0
