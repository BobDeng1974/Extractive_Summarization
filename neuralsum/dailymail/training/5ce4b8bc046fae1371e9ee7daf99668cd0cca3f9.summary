@entity0 is the new , erm , black , this weekend with the return of proper football boots			1
many of us would have been forgiven for thinking plain boots were a thing of the past , sent to the footballing equivalent of @entity9 , lost in the @entity10			2
@entity11 and orange and yellow and green , indigo , violet and blue ; the colours of the rainbow really have helped to light up the game ’s top leagues over the last decade			0
@entity19 will wear all - black boots in @entity23 's @entity22 clash against @entity24 on saturday @entity19 , who scored in @entity23 's 3 - 0 defeat of @entity26 on tuesday , will don black boots this weekend indeed only one of the 22 who started @entity31 's @entity30 tie at @entity32 stuck with tradition , and it was the @entity35 25			1
you know , @entity37 ? ok , me neither			0
but now thanks to the planet ’s biggest player , black will be back on the menu this weekend and with it a nod to football ’s days of yore			0
@entity19 , the footballer of the year , will wear black boots in the globe ’s biggest game when @entity23 host @entity24 in @entity48 on saturday			1
and the @entity50 superstar will not be alone			0
only one of the 22 players who started @entity31 's match against @entity32 wore black boots @entity55 @entity54 will also be donning black footwear when he takes to the @entity58 dancefloor for the visit of @entity61 leaders @entity62			1
between them , @entity19 and @entity63 will help to provide footballing fans with a throwback to yesteryear ; and with it some nostalgia for those of us who grew up where black was the only option on the colour chart			1
i was probably about nine or 10 , when our star striker turned up to match in a pair of all - white boots			2
‘ take those off , ’ he blasted			0
‘ you ’ll be a target for the opposition ; they ’ll want to kick you off the park because you think you 're special			0
’ @entity86 in action for @entity88 in 1984 and @entity89 and his @entity91 team - mates back in 1995 @entity94 's @entity93 winning captain @entity92 and @entity50 's @entity95 ahead of the 1966 semi-final despite the flicks of red and green , @entity99 's treble - winning side wore predominantly black boots the striker in question sent his dad home and asked him to bring back his black boots			1
he then begrudgingly walked back to the changing room , pulled on his @entity107 , and promptly bagged a hat - trick			0
take a walk to your local playing field on a sunday morning in 2014 however , and you ’ll be hard - pressed to find a kid sporting a black pair of boots			1
@entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 all wear coloured boots			1
so , why would n’t they ? @entity19 ’s nod to footballing nostalgia could however , buck that trend			2
they ’re not proper football boots , mind			0
he ’ll be donning that daft sock boot , but i guess it ’s a start ... @entity117 , sporting orange footwear , takes on the @entity133 defence in his side 's victory earlier this week			2

@entity19 to wear all - black footwear in @entity23 's clash against @entity24
@entity63 will also sport a pair of *non-coloured* boots against @entity62
