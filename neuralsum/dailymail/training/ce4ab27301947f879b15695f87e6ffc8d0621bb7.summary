by @entity0 published : 07:44 est , 29 may 2012 updated : 20:13 est , 29 may 2012 they married in secret a few days before he went to war			0
@entity5 had no idea if he would ever see young @entity7 again , but he made her a solemn promise			2
everywhere the @entity10 gi went with his unit , he would carve their names into a tree			2
the first was on @entity15 , where he was stationed before joining the push towards @entity18 in the wake of the d - day invasion			0
the rest were spread across @entity22 and @entity23 , carved whenever time allowed			2
fascinating work : @entity25 , 24 , has become the world 's only expert in military tree carvings by using the bark graffiti to trace soldiers ' life stories @entity32 never knew if it was just a romantic bluff , or if he had simply made up the story to impress her			1
but they clearly did n’t reckon on the determination of @entity39 student @entity25 and her remarkable archaeological quest			1
more than six decades later , and several years after @entity5 died , the 24 - year - old specialist in military tree carvings tracked @entity7 down from the information on the @entity15 tree – and showed her the proof			1
love message : miss @entity47 traced @entity10 gi @entity5 , left , and his wife @entity7 after finding the message he carved in 1945 on a tree , right , on @entity15 @entity51 : miss @entity47 then sent @entity7 fearing a photograph of the tree her late husband engraved for her on the other side of the world shortly before she died it was one of hundreds of tree carvings @entity59 has documented as part of her @entity62 research into military ‘ arborglyphs ’			1
many tell the poignant stories of ordinary soldiers in the @entity68 , some clearly composed by @entity70 who feared they might otherwise be lost without trace in the mud of the @entity75 battlefields , or by @entity77 forces launched into bloody conflict in @entity79			1
‘ @entity5 – @entity82 , @entity83 , 1945 , ’ was followed by a love heart and the name @entity7			0
from that simple inscription , @entity84 traced the couple ’s daughter @entity86 in @entity10 , and was eventually able to present @entity7 with a photograph of the message her husband carved for her all those years ago			2
happy families : after he returned from the war mr @entity5 , seen left with his wife @entity7 and their granddaughter @entity95 , then four , lived a long life until 2001 snail mail : mr @entity5 also wrote to his wife in the more traditional way ‘ it was amazing to be able to give her that and show her the carving , ’ said @entity84 , who has recorded 1,500 trees in @entity22 alone since starting her research five years ago			1
she uses military and public records , censuses and other material to identify individuals			0
‘ when you try to pick them out from thousands of marks , you start to get amazing stories , ’ she said			0
‘ to me , it makes the soldiers individuals			0
' some of them will have given their lives with hardly anyone learning anything about them			0
’ @entity84 , from @entity122 , @entity123 , noticed a dramatic contrast between messages left in pre-battle training grounds and personal information she uncovered on trees in @entity22			1
another find : miss @entity47 also tracked down the story of @entity133 @entity132 , seen with his wife @entity134 on their wedding day , via his tree carving legacy : @entity133 made the ' @entity139 , @entity141 ' carving when he was stationed in @entity142 and @entity15 on june 19 1918			2
miss @entity47 later tracked down his sons @entity144 and @entity145 soldiers in a war zone often recorded as much information as they could , carving names of girlfriends , wives , times , dates , thoughts and feelings			1
yesterday she told me : ‘ in @entity159 , many of the inscriptions are simply initials			2
by the time the soldiers get to @entity22 , they are carving self - portraits , pictures of their houses , animals ... anything that ’s important in their lives			1
‘ it ’s as if people are saying “ this is me , i was here , this is my wife , this is where i ’m from – and tomorrow i ’m going to face the enemy ”			0
one inscription made reference to @entity22 in time of war and added : “ @entity171 ”			1
’ until she starts to research the carvings , @entity59 can not tell if it will produce a tale of happiness or tragedy			0
‘ @entity187 , @entity188 , [ for @entity188 ] september 22 1916 ’ , for example , turned out to be @entity185 , who joined the @entity186 aged 22 but died just weeks before the war ended			0
work in progress : miss @entity47 , seen taking an imprint of an ' arborglyph ' , is studying the inscriptions as part of her archaeology phd travelled : miss @entity47 has been recording arborglyphs since 2007/8 and has travelled all over @entity195 to see them , from @entity159 to @entity197 to @entity198 and @entity22 another soldier – @entity133 @entity132 , who served in both @entity200 – was deployed to @entity159 in 1918 and carved himself into history with this simple inscription : ‘ @entity139 , @entity141 ’			1
@entity84 traced his family and discovered he had won a bravery medal in @entity22 before going on to serve with colonial forces in the @entity207 army			1
@entity59 , whose phd is being funded by the @entity210 , is currently researching at @entity211 , @entity212 , where @entity10 forces were stationed in the @entity214			2
‘ some carvings there have remained virtually unnoticed despite thousands of visitors , ’ she said			0
‘ unfortunately trees die or are cut down			0
that ’s why i want to record as many as i can			0

@entity25 has become the world ’s only expert in military tree carvings
she has traced @entity75 and @entity214 soldiers from the carvings they made during the wars
the phd student has noticed carvings on trees in @entity22 hold a lot more information , *including* soldiers ' feelings , than the ones in @entity159
