by @entity0 published : 05:52 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 08:17 est , 26 march 2013 a mother - of - three whose crippling back ache left her bedridden has finally been given a new lease of life - thanks to a remote control			1
@entity6 suffered agonising back pain for almost 30 years and was left barely able to walk			1
but after being given a remote control , which is used to block pain signals to the brain , @entity6 can live her life free from agony for the first time in years			1
mrs @entity6 , from from @entity14 , @entity15 , has been fitted with a spinal cord stimulator - where electrodes are implanted into her spine , along with a battery pack , which is controlled with the remote and recharged through the skin			1
she can now use the remote to control how much pain relief she receives			1
cured : @entity6 suffered from crippling back ache for 30 years before she was given a new remote - controlled device to relieve her pain pioneering : an x-ray of the spinal cord stimulator that has cured her back pain			1
electrodes are inserted into the body and the strength of pain relief they provide is determined by the remote control she said : ' before i had the remote the back pain was almost unbearable			1
i could hardly walk and i do n't think i had a full night 's sleep in about eight years			2
' it 's was like toothache in your back all day			0
i had to live on pain killers and i woke up crying every day			2
mrs @entity6 has been fitted with a spinal cord stimulator , which involves having electrodes implanted in the spine			1
these are powered by a battery pack that is also implanted and recharged through the skin			2
the electrodes prevent pain signals from reaching the brain by interrupting them			1
the level of pain relief the electrodes deliver - depending on how bad the pain is that day - is determined by the remote control			1
' it was soul destroying and i would n't wish it on my worst enemy , so when it was suggested that i try the remote i jumped at the chance			2
' if my back is hurting more one day , i can just turn up the device with the control , and if it 's not as bad i turn it down			2
if i 'm doing something that takes a lot of energy , like going to the gym , i 'll turn myself up			0
" i 'm very protective of the remote - i do n't take it out of the house and i always know where it is , i never let it get lost			2
' it 's actually a cutting - edge neurostimulation system - but it 's as easy to use as turning on the telly			0
' after years of agony i could n't be happier - i 've got my life back			0
' mrs @entity6 first suffered back ache when she was just 15 years old due to a slip in the spine			1
she underwent surgery which fused the bottom two vertebra in her spine together , but was devastated to find in december 2004 that the fuse had worn away			1
' i started suffering back pain again but i was convinced it would n't be anything major			2
i never knew it was going to be the start of such much agony			0
' i was in constant pain			2
i could n't sit or stand in any way that would make me feel better , and walking or standing for long periods of time was totally out of the question			0
before having surgery , mrs @entity6 underwent a trial of the spinal cord stimulator which significantly reduced her pain happy : having had surgery , and being given to remote control to black pain signals to the brain , she can live pain - free for the first time in years the 43 - year - old had hoped that surgery in january 2006 , which involved placing a titanium cage filled with bone at the bottom of her spine , would have been the answer to all her @entity123 , once again no relief came			1
' i thought i would wake up for the operation and be pain free but it was like nothing had changed			0
' from then on , she attended a pain clinic at @entity130 where she was put on various different pain relief medication			1
' i tried everything - i had @entity133 , patches which acted like local anaesthetic , acupuncture , steroid injections - it was never ending			1
' i was in a constant battle against myself and i became a recluse			0
i could n't go on holiday with my family or go shopping with my daughter			0
' it was n't until five years later , when @entity6 was referred to the @entity145 in @entity146 in 2011 , that she finally saw an answer to her prayers			2
' when i was referred to the @entity145 they diagnosed me with @entity150			0
' as soon as i got a diagnosis , it opened doors to even more types of pain relief - one of which was the spinal cord stimulator			1
active : the device also means she is no longer bedridden with pain and can go out and about with daughter @entity161 and son will ' i 'd read about it online but i never thought i 'd be eligible			0
but after i was assessed by the team at the centre , and they told me that i was a candidate for it , i was over the moon			0
' mrs @entity6 said : ' i was given the stimulator for a two - week trial in march 2012			1
they insert electrodes in your back and a battery is strapped around you which you have to charge up			0
then i have the remote to control the amount of pain relief i receive			1
' as soon as the device was fitted i felt like a different person			0
i had to keep a pain dairy and score my pain out of ten - before the trial my pain was a ten at least , but with the stimulator it was down to a 2 or 3			2
transformed : mrs @entity6 says the surgery has totally changed her life ' as soon as i knew it was working i told the doctors they 'd have to fight me to give it back			1
' luckily the trial was such a success that they told me i could receive a permanent one which was implanted in may			0
' they turned the device on in the theatre , and since then i 've never switched it off			0
' the remote control has three different programmes - each with a low , medium and high setting - which she can vary depending on how bad her pain is that day			1
the device also includes a battery pack which is implanted inside @entity6 , which she recharges every day			1
' i recharge my batteries while i watch tv in the evening			0
it 's all really easy			0
' since @entity6 received the transplant , her life has been totally transformed			2
' i went from staying in bed all day , to going for a full afternoon 's shopping with my daughter			0
after years and years of suffering i can finally live my life			0
' if someone had told me this years ago i would n't have believed them			0
i 'm so lucky to be where i am today			0
i ca n't quite believe it			0
' dr @entity220 , her doctor at the @entity145 , said : ' @entity6 had severe back and leg pain which was not helped with spinal fusion			1
her pain has been intractable and longstanding , having had trials of various treatments , including injections			1
' she is the first patient treated with high frequency spinal stimulation at @entity145 and i am delighted the way her pain has responded to this treatment			2
' she has improvement in her function and quality of life , this is great news for patients like her who may be suffering with similar conditions			0

@entity6 , 43 , could barely walk due to the agonising pain
*numerous* treatments such as steroid injections and surgery had failed
now has a spinal cord stimulator , where electrodes are implanted in spine
these prevent pain signals from reaching the brain by interrupting them
the level of pain relief the electrodes deliver is determined by remote control
