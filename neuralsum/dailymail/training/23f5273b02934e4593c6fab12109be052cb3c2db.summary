by @entity0 published : 18:42 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 10:53 est , 4 april 2013 cash bribes to hospitals to put patients on to the controversial @entity4 will be ended , families have been told			1
the disclosure means that the @entity8 payments – which amount to at least £ 30million – are likely to be stopped later this year			1
a @entity11 inquiry is underway into the @entity4 , which was originally developed to ease the last days and hours of dying patients			1
progress : @entity14 mp , left , saved her father from the pathway which care minister @entity17 , right , said he acknowledged ' terrified ' some people care minister @entity17 spoke to families of @entity4 patients in @entity21 in the first of a series of meetings designed to feed their views into the inquiry , which was launched in february and will report in the summer			1
one family at the meeting said that their 82 - year old grandmother died over a period of 12 days after fluids and food were withdrawn			0
they said that their grandmother , who had early stage cervical cancer , was eating and drinking before being put on the @entity4			1
how the @entity38 has reported on the controversial @entity4 one family member said that mr @entity17 acknowledged that people were ‘ terrified ’ of the @entity4			1
she added : ‘ he is appalled that people feared they were not getting cared for but put to death in hospital			2
he said he would definitely be looking to stop any form of financial payment to hospitals to put patients on the @entity4			1
‘ he said that most definitely he did n’t believe that hospitals should be gaining from patients dying on the @entity4			1
’ payments to hospitals to hit targets were first revealed by the @entity38 last autumn			0
some have been paid hundreds of thousands of pounds a year for reaching targets for @entity4 deaths			2
for example , the hospital trust in @entity56 was last year paid £ 450,000 in return for ensuring 35 per cent of patients who die in hospital are on the @entity4			1
families have protested that relatives who were not dying have been placed on the @entity4			2
@entity64 mp @entity14 has told how she saved her father ’s life when she pulled him off the @entity4			2
she had already seen her mother die an ‘ agonising ’ death when she was put on an end - of - life pathway after brain surgery two years earlier			0
miss @entity14 said her 83 - year - old father was admitted to a hospital , which she did not name , suffering from an unidentified illness that left him ‘ weak and frail ’			0
after a few days , a nurse had ‘ almost casually ’ told her : ‘ he has not long to live			0
we are putting him on the @entity4			2
’ miss @entity14 told a meeting in @entity78 there had been ‘ no discussion , no explanation , no consultation ’ between the family and the hospital staff			0
she said that her mother ’s ‘ heart - rending ’ death after being deprived of food and fluids – without her family being consulted – had left her with a sense of ‘ terrible guilt ’			0
the @entity94 mp contacted her sister and they insisted their father was removed from the @entity4			0
he was placed in a nursing home			0
‘ now , well over six months later that elderly man is very much alive , eating well , getting up when he wants and resting when he does n’t , enjoying visits from his family , ’ she said			0
‘ he is looking forward to his 85th birthday			0
’ an end to payments for @entity4 targets would free hospitals from the suspicion of taking money in return for the deaths of patients			1
analysts believe the inquiry will also recommend that no patient should be put on the @entity4 without either their own consent or that of their closest family			1
another likelihood is a change of name so the tainted title of @entity4 is no longer used			0
mr @entity17 said : ‘ it is important that i respect the independence of this review but i have already made clear that i have serious concerns about the use of financial incentives and that they should only ever be used if they demonstrably improve patient care			2
