by @entity0 the first pictures of one of the world 's rarest sea creatures , @entity1 the white humpback whale , have been taken of the magnificent animal beginning his yearly migration north along @entity10 's eastern seaboard			1
the all - white @entity1 who shares his distinguishable albino appearance with just one other white whale in the world , a @entity15 , was sighted for the first time this year by a member of the public just off the coast of @entity20 in southern @entity21 on tuesday			1
he was then spotted several times again on thursday , with camera crews getting magnificent views of the 35 - year - old off the coast of @entity27			1
he was snapped and filmed breaching in waters off @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 as @entity10 's much - loved white whale continued his three - month migratory trip from @entity34 to @entity35 and back			1
by friday he will have made his way north of @entity52 , before reaching @entity35 at the end of the month			0
he is being joined by others from the @entity10 @entity56 humpback whale population , leaving the cool waters of the @entity59 behind in search of @entity35 's tropical warm paradise			2
photographer @entity37 was on scene to snap @entity1 during his first movements through @entity27			2
mr @entity64 was tipped off by whale station volunteers at @entity29 that @entity1 and a pod of other humpbacks were swimming a few hundred metres off shore in what 's known as a ' competition pod			1
' ' they try to swim as fast as they can and jostle for the dominant position , zig - zagging underwater , ' he told @entity76			0
usually restricted to a minimum of 150 metres from @entity1 , mr @entity37 and his team from @entity27 got closer than they anticipated because of the pods erratic underwater behaviour			2
he said his crew were forced to the boat 's engine off and idle near the whales which surfaced closer to the boat than expected			0
@entity1 , just one of two white humpback whales in the world , breaches in the foreground with a stunning afternoon backdrop of @entity27 's @entity92 behind him mr @entity37 was on @entity1 watch on thursday , first heading to @entity31 at 6.30am , before receiving a call from a whale station at @entity29 to inform he and his whale watching team that @entity1 was further south @entity1 is only part way into his three month winter journey from @entity34 to @entity35 in search of warmer water the best places to catch @entity1 this week will be @entity52 and @entity102 , north of @entity27 on friday , before makes his journey north to @entity104 where he was first spotted by a marine biologist 23 years ago @entity10 laws exist whereby planes and sea craft are prohibited from entering a certain zone when photographing or filming @entity1			1
founder of the @entity111 , who has been tracking the albino 's movements since he was first spotted in the early 90s , told @entity76 why			0
mr @entity115 , who also runs a blog dedicated purely to the ' fascinating ' sea creature , said @entity1 survived a run - in with a trimaran or outrigger boat which left him with significant black scarring on his lower back			0
the close shave meant tougher laws were brought in to protect the rare animal who has a life expectancy of 80			0
' planes have to stay at least 2000 feet from him and 500 feet if you are travelling in a boat , ' mr @entity115 said			0
@entity115 excitedly tweeted to his followers about @entity1 's first @entity10 sighting for the 2104 migratory season @entity30 , @entity29 and @entity31 were some of the areas around @entity27 where @entity1 was spotted on thursday members of the public were more than interested in getting a glimpse of the famous white whale mr @entity115 also took to twitter on thursday afternoon to spread the good news that @entity1 was in @entity27			1
@entity1 was just sighted off @entity30 30 minutes ago , heading north towards @entity31 , enjoy ! ' the researcher runs his pet , not - for - profit blog full of facts , photos and other tidbits about @entity10 's much - loved sea creature			1
the site , migaloo.com.au , is used predominantly as an education tool for school children			0
' i 've had quite a lot of money offered for the website , but i use it as an educational site mainly for school kids who send me plenty of emails at this time of year			0
' as well as receiving countless school children 's emails , mr @entity115 is also inundated with great images and updates of @entity1 's three - month round journey from @entity34 and back between late june and september .			2
