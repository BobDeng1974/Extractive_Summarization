by @entity0 published : 18:22 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 07:31 est , 1 june 2013 in a bid to stop student loan rates from doubling next month , president @entity1 got personal in a speech friday morning at the @entity6			1
flanked by current college students , he spoke of his and @entity9 's own struggle with student loan debt			0
' @entity9 , we did not finish paying off our student loans until about nine years ago , and our student loans cost more than our mortgage , ' @entity1 said			1
' right when we wanted to start saving for @entity16 and @entity17 's college education , we were still paying off our own college education			0
' interest rates on new subsidized @entity21 loans are set to go from 3.4 per cent to 6.8 per cent on july 1			1
lawmakers from both parties say they want to avoid the increase but are divided over how to do so			0
' that 's like a $ 1,000 tax hike , ' the president said			1
@entity1 made his case flanked by college students wearing business suits and dresses on a steamy @entity41 morning in the @entity42			2
the event marked the beginning of a public campaign by the president to extend temporarily current student loan rates or find a long - term compromise to avoid the rate increase			2
the event also gave the president a chance to try to move past political controversies that have been dogging his agenda , including investigations into last year 's deadly attack in @entity55 , political targeting at the @entity57 and secret monitoring of journalists who reported stories based on national security leaks			0
@entity1 opened his @entity42 appearance by touting economic improvements during his presidency			2
student loan interest rates set to double : the chart above shows how much college graduates will actually be paying after 10 years of loan debt @entity1 said rising college debt - more than $ 26,000 on average for a four - year degree - saddles young adults with debt just as they are starting out and prevents them from buying cars and houses , hurting the economy overall			1
' that does n't just hold back our young graduates			0
it holds back our entire middle class , ' @entity1 said			0
the @entity6 has proposed linking federal student loan rates to the financial markets			1
the @entity86 - controlled @entity6 passed a plan last week that would reset student loan rates every year according to financial markets , but @entity1 has threatened to veto the bill in part because it does n't lock in current low rates			1
' the @entity6 bill is n't smart and it 's not fair , ' @entity1 said			1
but @entity6 @entity94 were n't too keen on the speech , accusing @entity1 of playing politics instead of sitting down to work out small differences and avoid an increase			1
@entity1 : a picture of the president during his days at @entity101 , where @entity9 also attended			2
the two met at the law firm @entity103 in @entity104 the road to college : president @entity1 graduating from high school in @entity108 honor student : first lady @entity110 graduated cum laude from @entity112 in 1985			2
president @entity1 said in his speech that neither of them would be in the @entity6 without their college education ' the differences between the @entity6 plan and the president 's are small , and there 's no reason they can not be overcome quickly , ' @entity117 said in a statement			1
' but today , rather than working to resolve the issue , the president resorted to a campaign stunt to try to score political points			0
if the president is truly unhappy with inaction , the only place to look is the @entity130 - run @entity129 , which has taken no action to prevent rates from doubling			0
' the @entity129 is scheduled to vote on the issue next week , said majority leader @entity134			0
the @entity129 version would freeze current rates for two years while @entity32 works on a long - term fix , something the @entity6 says @entity1 supports			1
@entity1 spoke personally about the power of an advanced degree , saying he and his wife are only in the @entity6 because of their education			2
' we did n't come from privilege , ' the president said			0
higher education can not be a luxury for a privileged few , ' @entity1 said			0
' it is an economic necessity that every family should be able to afford , every young person with dreams and ambition should be able to access			0

interest rates on student loans are set to double next month , from 3.4 per cent to 6.8 per cent
the president describes it as being like a ' $ 1,000 tax hike '
