a skeleton key , one that can open any lock , is normally something confined to the realms of films and television			2
but two engineers claim to have devised a @entity8 printed ‘ bump key ’ that , with a bit of brute force , can do exactly that			1
their device can apparently be used to open any conventional lock without having access to the real key used to open it			0
these devices can be used to break into popular pin tumbler design locks			1
in a video a lock is opened by a bump key and a hammer in seconds			1
to make the key all that is needed is a picture of the lock and pin positions later this month at an event known as @entity35 2014 @entity19 engineer @entity33 will present his and @entity37 ' bump key design			1
lock bumping is a lock picking technique that can be used to open pin tumbler locks ( shown above ) , the sort found in many homes			1
these locks require a key with specific groves at different levels to align a set of pins along what is called the shear line , allowing the lock to be turned			0
each pin has an upper and lower segment , as shown in the image			0
a bump key , meanwhile , has groves that are all at the same level			2
when the key is placed in a lock , it needs to be struck sharply with a hammer while torque is applied			0
the force of the blow makes the top of the pins ‘ jump ’ above the shear line but leaves the bottom pins in place , allowing the lock to be turned			0
a stopper is also used to prevent damage being done to the lock			0
traditionally bump keys were made out of metal , and were quite hard to manufacture			2
now , with the 3d - printing method , anyone could feasibly create their own bump key			1
using diy software known as @entity81 , the technique requires only a picture of the lock in question to produce a working key			0
‘ while there are locks on the market , that are immune to bumping , a large quantity of locks in use is theoretically vulnerable , ’ @entity33 explains in a blog post			0
a bump key , as its name might imply , involves ‘ bumping ’ a key into position in a lock			1
they have multiple grooves cut to the same length that can fit into conventional locks			0
they are normally made from blank keys , which are flattened keys with no cuts , used by locksmiths and manufacturers to make key duplicates			1
the technique for making bump keys is n’t particularly new ; it ’s been around for decades , with a hammer used to hit the key and click it into a lock ’s pins			1
with @entity115 , however , such keys can now be made relatively easily			0
to create the key , @entity33 and @entity37 use a picture of the lock in question			1
they also need to know the position of each pin in a target lock , which is accessible from widely available key - cutting software			2
mr @entity33 says it can be used to open locks that are vulnerable to bumping , but such keys have been on the market for more than ten years			2
the 3d printing technique , however , makes the creation of both blank and bump keys much easier			2
‘ if you have the right software , getting a blank is easy , ’ @entity33 tells @entity130			1
@entity134 tells @entity130 that he does not think his work will be used by burglars to break into houses			1
' one of the main reasons is probably that there are easier , destructive entry methods , and a burglar is not interested in non-destructive opening , ’ he says ‘ basically , i take a photo [ from the front ] , then i manually edit it in @entity146 or @entity147 ( it 's really easy ) to give me a black / white silhouette of the profile , ' mr @entity33 continues			0
‘ once i have that , i import it into my software , specify the key length ( that would also be guessed from the brand ) and from that , i already get a 3d model that i can order from any online 3d printing service			0
’ but , he says , making a bump key is a bit more difficult			2
it requires knowledge of the pin distances and maximum height , which can be guessed from other keys or taken from a database			0
to print them he does n’t use his own printer , but rather a professional printing service which can take a few days , or up to two weeks			0
to create the key , @entity33 and @entity37 use a picture of a lock in @entity172 also need to know the position of each pin , which is accessible from widely available key - cutting software			1
mr @entity33 says it can be used to open locks that are vulnerable to bumping , but such keys have been on the market for more than ten years the bump key is made from a 3d model of a blank ( shown ) and has groves that are all at the same level			1
when the key is placed in a lock , it needs to be struck sharply with a hammer while torque is applied			0
the force of the blow moves the pins and allows the lock to be turned and opened on whether a burglar could use this technique to break into a house mr @entity33 says : ‘ if he has enough criminal energy , then i guess , yes			1
’ however he adds that he does not think this is a ‘ realistic scenario ’ ; he says that bump keys are already available , but they are not widely used by burglars			1
‘ one of the main reasons is probably that there are easier , destructive entry methods , and a burglar is not interested in non-destructive opening , ’ he explains			0
‘ at least here in @entity19 , only something below 0.2 per cent of all burglar attacks target the lock cylinder			0
’ but his advice is that if you are worried about bump keys , there are locks are available that are immune to bumping			1
' all regular pin tumbler looks are vulnerable , ' he says , but other systems are typically immune			2
using a pin tumbler design with a so - called ' sidebar ' , however , requires a second combination on the key that is much harder to mimic			1
but despite revealing his technique to create bump keys , mr @entity223 does n't consider bumping ' a larger threat now ' with his work			2
' the practical relevance of bumping ( for burglars ) seems to be overall low , so there is no reason to panic about this , ' he says			0
' people also have n't panicked the last 10 years , although bumping was a well known technique			0

a @entity19 engineer has revealed how to make @entity8 - printed ' bump keys '
these devices can be used to break into popular pin tumbler design locks
in the video a lock is opened by a bump key and a hammer in seconds
