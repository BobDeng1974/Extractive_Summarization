by @entity0 last updated at 4:13 pm on 14th december 2011 @entity1 took his seat alongside the prime minister today for the final session of prime minister 's questions before @entity7 today			1
on monday the @entity9 deputy prime minister failed to take his seat on the @entity12 front benches to hear @entity13 defend his use of the veto at the @entity17 summit which saw him dubbed ' the incredible sulk '			1
shortly after the start of the session to loud cheers from @entity23 mps @entity22 gestured to mr @entity1 and said : ' it is good to see the deputy prime minister back on the frontbench			1
' rather not be here ? @entity1 looks into the distance as @entity13 begins @entity29 in the @entity30 today the prime minister speaking on monday in the @entity32 where he defended his decision to veto a new @entity17 treaty amid criticism from mr @entity1 that the move was ' bad for @entity37 ' @entity38 , editor of @entity39 , pointed out with this tweet that with @entity41 not in the @entity42 , he 'd effectively ' done a @entity1 ' @entity43 mocked mr @entity1 for exposing coalition rifts over @entity45 by staying away from the chamber on monday for the prime minister 's statement on the @entity50 summit			1
mr @entity22 said that mr @entity13 had promised the coalition @entity12 would operate in a ' collegiate ' way , and asked : ' what 's gone wrong ? ' but mr @entity13 retorted : ' no one in this @entity32 is going to be surprised that conservatives and @entity58 @entity57 do n't always agree about @entity45 ... ' i make no apology for standing up for @entity37			1
' mr @entity22 told mr @entity13 that negotiations on the implementation of last week 's inter-governmental agreement on a new fiscal compact for the eurozone would continue until march and it was not too late for the @entity37 to rejoin discussions			1
' in the cold light of day , with other countries spending the weeks and months ahead trying to see if they can get a better deal for themselves , is n't the sensible thing to do to re-enter the negotiations and try to get a better deal for @entity37 ? ' asked the @entity23 leader			1
mr @entity22 also offered his sympathy to mr @entity1 , who was woken in the early hours of last friday to be told that mr @entity13 had used the veto to block @entity17 treaty changes designed to impose new fiscal disciplines on eurozone states			1
the deputy prime minister addresses business leaders this morning			1
@entity84 chief @entity83 said yesterday that a demand by @entity37 for its financial services industry to be exempted from @entity17 regulation threatened to break up the single market @entity13 leaves @entity89 as he prepares to address prime ministers @entity90 's at the @entity32 ' i think our sympathy is with the deputy prime minister , ' said the @entity23 leader			1
' his partner goes on a business trip , he is left waiting by the phone and he hears nothing until a rambling phone call at 4am confessing to a terrible mistake			0
' but mr @entity13 said mr @entity22 had failed to make clear whether he would have signed the proposed treaty , taunting him : ' this leader of the @entity23 makes weakness and indecision into an art form			1
' mr @entity13 sought to turn mr @entity22 's accusations of a rift back on the @entity23 leader by highlighting his own differences with brother @entity13			1
responding to the @entity113 's taunts about his row with mr @entity1 , the prime minister said to loud @entity116 cheers : ' he should n't believe everything he reads in the papers			1
it 's not that bad - it 's not like we 're brothers or anything			0
' @entity38 , editor of @entity39 , tweeted that with @entity41 not in the @entity42 , he 'd effectively ' done a @entity1 ' then looking directly at mr @entity22 , mr @entity13 hit back at the @entity113 for not saying what he would have done at the @entity123			1
' he has completely united his party , every single one has asked @entity126 for the same thing , a new leader for @entity7 , ' said the prime minister			1
the clash came shortly after mr @entity1 met a group of pro-european business leaders who are concerned over the use of the veto and over mr @entity13 's threat to block the use of @entity17 institutions to support the new compact			2
despite the deep differences on @entity45 between the coalition parties exposed by mr @entity13 's decision to deploy the @entity37 veto last week , mr @entity1 insisted he spoke for the whole government in asserting the need for @entity37 to 're - engage ' with @entity45			2
the deputy prime minister was addressing members of pro-single market group @entity147 ( @entity149 ) , whose director @entity150 said mr @entity13 was mistaken to wield the veto			1
the breakfast meeting in a @entity153 hotel came just hours before mr @entity1 was appeared alongside mr @entity13 at @entity129 's questions in the @entity30			2
mr @entity1 and his @entity57 @entity43 abstained en masse last night rather than back a motion congratulating mr @entity13 for protecting @entity37 interests in @entity50			2
he told the business leaders : ' as the dust settles on the summit that took place last week , i speak here on behalf of the whole coalition government , notwithstanding the differences of view between the parties within the government			0
' the whole government is absolutely determined to re-engage with our @entity45 partners , to get back on the front foot and to make sure that our vital national economic self - interest in being at the heart of the single market is properly followed through the weeks and months ahead			2
' he told the @entity177 members , including @entity116 peer and former @entity45 commissioner @entity179 , @entity181 chairman sir @entity183 and @entity184 chief executive @entity182 : ' you know as well as i do that your businesses and millions of people 's jobs in this country depend on our place at the heart of the single market			0
' mr @entity1 said there was ' a considerable amount of uncertainty ' about how the fiscal compact agreed by up to 26 @entity17 states in @entity50 last friday would work in practice			0
following yesterday 's @entity201 meeting , there was speculation that mr @entity13 may be prepared to offer an olive branch to @entity57 colleagues by softening his objections to the @entity17 institutions , like the @entity84 and @entity207 , being used to support the compact			2
mr @entity1 called for ' calm ' after the confrontational rhetoric seen yesterday in the @entity210 in @entity211 , where some @entity212 issued demands for @entity37 to lose its rebate in retaliation for its lack of ' solidarity '			0
' we saw some pretty intemperate remarks aimed at @entity37 yesterday in the @entity210 , ' said mr @entity1			0
' i hope we can move beyond that and work together to ensure that our calm , reasoned and engaged voice is heard positively within the @entity17 institutions in the period to come			0
' with three million @entity37 jobs dependent on the single market , he said @entity12 and business should work together to ensure that ' those countries that invest very heavily in the @entity37 from @entity230 , from @entity231 and elsewhere are absolutely in no doubt that @entity37 is and will always remain a gateway for trade and for the exchange of services and goods into the @entity45 single market '			0
he added : ' that is the reason they invested in @entity37 in the first place and we must make absolutely sure that they remain confident that these reasons still prevail and still support further decisions for increased investment in the @entity37			0
' mr @entity1 was flanked at the meeting - chaired by @entity149 chairman @entity248 - by @entity57 cabinet colleagues @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252 as well as senior backbencher @entity253			0
mr @entity150 told the @entity254 that @entity149 was a coalition of ' pragmatic pro-european business leaders who want the @entity37 government to be engaged in the process '			0
' we think that we need to support the eurozone and the best way of doing that is by ensuring that the @entity84 and @entity207 and the institutions are involved in this new fiscal compact , ' said mr @entity150			0
' if the euro collapses it will have a massive negative impact on @entity37			0
' we think the @entity129 did the wrong thing in using the veto			0
' leaving after an hour 's discussions , mr @entity248 said : ' we had a really good meeting and we are all on the same page and want constructive engagement and finding the formula that gets us back in with the 26			2
' business clearly wants a deepening and widening of the single market and that is what our message is in terms of wanting to see greater reforms			0
we are not defending the status quo , we are trying to see a changed and reformed @entity45			0
' asked if mr @entity13 was wrong to use the veto , mr @entity248 said : ' i think people are concerned about the position we are in but they are encouraged at what they have heard recently			2

to *labour* cheers , @entity22 : ' it is good to see the deputy prime minister back on the front bench '
@entity13 : ' he *[* @entity22 *]* has completely united his party , every single one has asked @entity126 for the same thing , a new leader for @entity7 . '
