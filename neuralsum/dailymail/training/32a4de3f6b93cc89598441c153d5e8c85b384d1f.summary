it has long been known that women can be guilty of faking the throes of passion in the bedroom , but a surprising number of men feign orgasms too , according to research carried out by a @entity10 academic			1
in his new book ‘ why men fake it : the @entity15 ’ , clinical professor of urology dr @entity12 , recounts numerous stories of men confessing that they pretend to climax			1
but the biggest shock was their reasoning			2
the big o : it is widely known that women do it , but men are faking it too ‘ the big surprise to me when i started doing this work 25 years ago is that once a man is in a relationship , he seems to care more about his partner than himself , ’ said dr @entity12			1
‘ for every man who behaves badly , i can give you 10 who are dedicated and thoughtful and doing the best they know how to be a man and a solid partner			2
’ it may seem unbelievable - not to mention physically impossible - but it is indeed possible for men to fake an orgasm , although quite how they do this is kept under wraps by @entity47 in an interview for online magazine salon			2
dr @entity12 ’s book paints a picture of a gender who are anxious about their erections , feel pressured into having sex and are concerned about their partner ’s pleasure			1
a recent study from the @entity61 found that 70 per cent of women and 30 per cent of men admitted faking orgasms			1
in the study , both sexes gave the same reasons for pretending - a partner 's orgasm was imminent so they felt under pressure to climax			0
the report said : ' the emphasis on men 's ability to give their partners " earth - shaking orgasms " sometimes leads both women and men to pretend orgasm to meet these expectations			2
' dr @entity12 says another reason for the rise in faked orgasms is down to the rapid change in gender identity across society , which has led many men to suffer a crisis of confidence about their masculinity			1
he cites the case of a 27 - year - old paraplegic who ca n’t feel or move anything from the waist down			0
insecure : dr @entity12 paints men as remarkably self - conscious in the bedroom ‘ i treat him so that he can have sex , and he comes back and is totally thrilled			1
his whole personality is different			0
he says , “ it ’s fantastic			0
i feel like a man again ! ” but here ’s the thing : he feels nothing down there			0
' dr @entity12 explains that the patient feels good about himself as a man - not because he ’s getting pleasurable sensations from sex , but because he is able to satisfy his wife			1
he adds that until around 60 years ago , having sex was understood as a women ’s duty rather than something she should enjoy			0
but now women expect to be pleasured			0
he illustrates his point with a patient who suffered with erectile dysfunction and was concerned he would never be able to find a partner because , he said , ‘ what woman would want to be with a guy that ca n’t satisfy her ? ’			0

a third of men have admitted faking orgasms
they do it out of love , *kindness* and sexual insecurity , according to dr @entity12 , a urologist
he says that once men are in committed relationships , they care about their partners more than themselves
