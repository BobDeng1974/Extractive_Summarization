ticking bomb : @entity54 has been erupting continuously since 1983 and the current flow that has been threatening @entity140 began in june heat : this pair of images released by the @entity144 compares a shot of the lava flow front ( left ) with a thermal image showing the approach of the scorching hot molten rock smoking : frequent methane explosions occur , resulting from cooked vegetation releasing methane which then ignites additional danger : the explosions caused by trapped methane gas can range from small puffs to loud cannon - like blasts @entity158 shot : this photo shows the front of a lava flow with numerous smoke plumes arising from active breakouts burning vegetation at the flow margin , near the town of @entity12 on the @entity6 of @entity6 alternative roads have been cut to provide evacuation routes should the lava flow cross the main road			1
