an @entity1 dentist acted legally in firing a long - time assistant because he - and his wife - viewed the married mother as a threat to their marriage , the all - male @entity3 ruled friday			1
the court ruled 7 - 0 bosses can sack employees they see as an ' irresistible attraction , ' even if they have not engaged in flirtatious behavior or otherwise done anything wrong			2
appearing on @entity15 friday night , assistant @entity14 said the decision was deeply unfair			1
fired : @entity14 was so attractive , @entity1 dentist @entity17 fired her out of fear she 'd make him want to stray from his marriage hello ladies : despite @entity21 being 21 years younger than him , married , and ' not interested in a relationship , ' @entity17 believed it would be too hard not to start an affair with her ' i do n't think this is fair , ' she said from her @entity1 home by phone			1
' i do n't think this is right			0
' such firings may be unfair , but they are not unlawful discrimination under the @entity35 because they are motivated by feelings and emotions , and not gender , justice @entity32 wrote			0
an attorney for @entity41 dentist @entity17 said the decision , the first of its kind in @entity1 , is a victory for family values because @entity17 fired @entity21 in the interest of saving his marriage , not because she was a woman			1
but @entity21 's attorney said @entity1 's all - male high court , one of only a handful in the nation , failed to recognize the discrimination women see routinely in the workplace			0
@entity21 insisted she was never interested in @entity17 romantically , regardless of his own feelings			2
' absolutely not , ' she said			0
' i 'm happily married			1
' content : happily married with children @entity21 said she saw @entity17 as a father figure and had ' absolutely ' no interest in him romantically since @entity17 fired her she has worked as a waitress six nights a week			1
while her former boss claimed her clothes were so tight he could n't look at her without being aroused , @entity21 said the only outfit she wore to work was standard scrubs worn by many nurses and assistants in dental offices			1
asked if she saw herself as irresistibly attractive , @entity21 laughed at the question			0
' i 'm just an ordinary girl , ' she said			0
' just an ordinary mom			0
' also appearing via call - in , her attorney , @entity77 , said it was unlikely they would seek an appeal because of the way the case was filed as only interpreting state law			0
' these judges sent a message to @entity1 women that they do n't think men can be held responsible for their sexual desires and that @entity1 women are the ones who have to monitor and control their bosses ' sexual desires , ' @entity86 said			0
' if they get out of hand , then the women can be legally fired for it			0
' @entity21 , 32 , worked for @entity17 for 10 years , and he considered her a stellar worker			1
but in the final months of her employment , he complained that her tight clothing was distracting , once telling her that if his pants were bulging that was a sign her clothes were too revealing , according to the opinion			0
he also once allegedly remarked about her infrequent sex life by saying , ' that 's like having a @entity112 in the garage and never driving it			0
' ' that 's like having a @entity112 in the garage and never driving it			0
' @entity17 and @entity21 — both married with children — started exchanging text messages , mostly about personal matters , such as their families			1
@entity17 's wife , who also worked in the dental office , found out about the messages and demanded @entity21 be fired			1
the @entity124 consulted with their pastor , who agreed that terminating @entity21 was appropriate			0
@entity17 fired @entity21 and gave her one month 's severance			1
he later told @entity21 's husband he worried he was getting too personally attached and feared he would eventually try to start an affair with her			2
family man : @entity17 's wife , who also works in the dental office , demanded @entity21 be fired when she discovered text messages ordinary mom : @entity21 has been working as a waitress since she lost her dental job and is unsure of her future career path @entity21 was stunned because she viewed the 53 - year - old @entity17 as a father figure and had never been interested in starting a relationship , @entity77 said			1
@entity21 filed a lawsuit alleging gender discrimination , arguing she would not have been terminated if she was male			0
she did not allege sexual harassment because @entity17 's conduct may not have risen to that level and did n't particularly offend her , @entity77 said			1
' the motives behind dr. @entity17 terminating mrs. @entity14 were quite clear : he did so to preserve his marriage			1
@entity17 argued @entity21 was fired not because of her gender , but because her continued employment threatened his marriage			2
a district judge agreed , dismissing the case before trial , and the high court upheld that ruling			0
@entity32 noted that @entity17 had an all - female workforce and @entity21 was replaced by a woman			2
he said the decision was in line with state and federal court rulings that found workers can be fired for relationships that cause jealousy and tension within a business owner 's family			2
one such case from the 8th @entity168 upheld a business owner 's firing of a valued employee who was seen by his wife as a threat to their marriage			2
in that case , the fired employee had engaged in flirtatious conduct			0
jurisprudence : justice @entity32 penned the @entity3 's decision on @entity17 's dismissal of @entity14 @entity32 said allowing @entity21 's lawsuit would stretch the definition of discrimination to allow anyone fired over a relationship to file a claim arguing they would not have been fired but for their gender			1
@entity17 's attorney , @entity191 , said the court got it right			1
the decision clarified that bosses can make decisions showing favoritism to a family member without committing discrimination ; in this case , by allowing @entity17 to honor his wife 's wishes to fire @entity21 , he said			1
@entity17 is a very religious and moral individual , and he sincerely believed that firing @entity21 would be best for all parties , he said			2
' while there was really no fault on the part of mrs. @entity14 , it was just as clear the decision to terminate her was not related to the fact that she was a woman , ' he said			2
' the motives behind dr. @entity17 terminating mrs. @entity14 were quite clear : he did so to preserve his marriage			1
' i do n't view this as a decision that was either pro-women or opposed to women rights at all			0
in my view , this was a decision that followed the appropriate case law			0
