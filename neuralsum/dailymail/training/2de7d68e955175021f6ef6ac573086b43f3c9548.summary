by @entity0 published : 22:15 est , 1 november 2012 updated : 22:15 est , 1 november 2012 principal @entity1 of @entity2 is a woman of her word			1
the principal of the @entity7 school made a deal with her students that if they could raise $ 12,000 for new school supplies , she would plant a kiss on the mouth of a pig			1
after her students raised more than $ 27,000 , @entity1 had no choice but to make good on her promise			1
forfeit : principal @entity1 bent down and puckered up with a pig called @entity17 after her students raised $ 27,000 for school supplies embrace : though slightly embarrassed , @entity1 said she was more than happy to kiss the pig since it was for a good cause standing in front of her student , @entity1 knelt down and put a peck on the mouth of @entity17			1
adding insult to injury , @entity17 was made up with a touch of lipstick			0
the students managed to keep their side of the deal by selling wrapping paper and food to the local community			1
though slightly embarrassed , @entity1 said she was more than happy to do so since it was for a good cause			2
' it was an experience , ' she told @entity38 in @entity7			0
' nothing what i thought it would be like			0
you know , you get yourself a little nervous			0
gross : the audience cheered when the principal got up and wiped the pig 's lipstick off her mouth ' but i 'm always taking care of my dogs and kissing my dogs at home			0
so it 's just like another pet kissing at home			0
' @entity1 is not the only school administrator to put their school before their pride			2
and it turns out kissing pigs seems to be a popular punishment for many principals			0
just a day before @entity1 kissed her pig , principal @entity66 of @entity67 in @entity68 planted a kiss on a pig of his own , celebrating the school â€™s strong test scores			1
and just three days before that , @entity73 , principal of @entity74 in @entity75 , kissed @entity77 after his students raised $ 12,400 as part of a charity fun run .			2

@entity1 *bet* that her students could *n't* raise $ 12,000 for school supplies
they *collected* more than $ 27,000 by selling wrapping paper and food
embarrassed principal kissed a pig called @entity17 as a forfeit
