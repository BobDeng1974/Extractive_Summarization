reduced rates : @entity1 allows @entity2 to split the cost of insurance with the organizers of large events there 's a chance the @entity9 wo n't be played this year because insurance used to cover the game is about to expire			1
it all depends on whether or not @entity13 renews the @entity1 , however without any insurance , the game will almost certainly have to be cancelled			2
terrorism insurance used to be widely available to @entity17 businesses including the organizers of sporting events			0
@entity1 was signed into law in 2002 in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , establishing a risk - sharing partnership between the federal government and the insurance industry			1
without federal support , most insurers had been unwilling to offer coverage			0
the act helps insure against terror attacks , and in recent weeks has been named a major concern for the organizers			1
the simplest way to understand the act is to know that it helps backstop private insurers who insure against damages from terrorism , making the rates lower for those who buy the insurance			0
although @entity1 was renewed in 2005 and in 2007 , it is set to expire on december 31 unless @entity13 renews it			2
with just two weeks to go before the deadline , the clock is ticking			0
without insurance , a high - risk event like the @entity9 can not go on			0
if @entity1 is not renewed , insurers will have the right to cancel terrorism insurance policies after january 1			1
insurers are sometimes likely to cancel policies out of fear of insolvency , should another massive terrorist attack occur without government assistance			0
prior to 9/11 , insurers included terrorism coverage in all commercial policies without charging for it			2
the risk from terrorism was low and below their threshold level of concern			0
however , after shelling out $ 44 billion in claims for 9/1 , insurers began to exclude terrorism from commercial policies			1
the @entity1 act has to be reauthorized during the next two weeks otherwise insurers will have the right to cancel terrorism insurance policies after january 1st , putting the february 1st game in jeopardy .			1

before 9/11 coverage for terror attacks was included for free on insurance policies
the 2001 attacks cost insurers $ 44 billion putting up the cost of *premiums*
@entity1 allows @entity2 to split the cost with the organizers of large events
