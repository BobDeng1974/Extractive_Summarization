@entity0 have warned @entity2 rivals that their £ 150million summer spending spree is only the beginning of an ongoing bid to snap up the world ’s top talent			1
the @entity9 outfit lavished an astonishing £ 150m over the summer on new six recruits , including a @entity12 transfer record £ 60m deal to land @entity15 wing wizard @entity14 from @entity16 and a further £ 31.5m to prise @entity17 away from @entity18			1
@entity20 striker @entity19 also joined from @entity21 in a mega-loan deal worth £ 20m			1
but far from putting away the cheque book , sources close to the club say the hunt for further @entity45 will continue , paid for by the expanding commercial revenues generated by the club , described as more than sufficient to fund the current and additional player costs			0
in the latest full - year accounts released for the club , covering the 2012 - 13 season , @entity0 ’s commercial operation pulled in £ 152.5m			1
however that figure has grown dramatically , with estimates suggesting that figure will be closer to £ 190m when the next full - year results - which cover 2013 - 14 - are released later this month			0
accounts covering the current season are expected to show commercial income closer to £ 240m when they are released next year			1
as a result , the @entity9 commercial operation will also allow the club to continue to pay massive wages , comparable with captain @entity65 who earns £ 300,000 a week			0
fueled for success : @entity0 's players pose as their official diesel engine partner is revealed on the board ( from left ) : @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 ( now at @entity74 ) in @entity75 last year party time : but ( from left ) @entity77 , @entity73 and @entity78 do not currently play for the club cashing in their chips : @entity83 is @entity0 's ' official savoury snack partner ' follow @entity84 @ alexmiller73 the feeling within the club is that there is still comfortable headroom to comply with the rules of both @entity91 ’s @entity90 and the @entity2 ’s @entity93 rules			2
the club ’s unprecedented spending spree is being paid for by a number of major deals			2
according to the club ’s official website , the club currently has 29 sponsors and commercial partners			1
these include the £ 47m - a - year shirt sponsorship deal with @entity105			0
@entity0 ’s world - record deal was agreed and signed in 2012 on terms of $ 559m over seven years , starting this season			1
@entity105 has replaced @entity0 ’s previous deal with @entity110 , which was worth £ 20m a year			1
however , @entity9 officials negotiated an ongoing £ 17m - a - year sponsorship deal with @entity110 that includes their training kit and sponsorship of the @entity116 training ground			0
local hero : @entity118 was a popular figure with fans in @entity121 and was part of a tomato juice campaign can - do attitude : @entity125 was also used to promote the tomato juice in @entity127 driving force : sir @entity129 attends a @entity105 soiree in @entity131 in the summer of 2012 delivering even more money : @entity133 pay @entity0 £ 10m a year to be the club 's official logistics partner next season will see the start of another record - breaking deal when adidas take over from @entity140 as the club ’s kit provider in an agreement worth a staggering £ 750m over 10 years , that 's £ 75m a year			1
the current deal with @entity140 is worth in the region of £ 30m a year			0
the deal with the @entity148 ’s sportswear giant is understood to contain a clause to cut @entity0 ’s earnings if they fail to qualify for the @entity151 for two consecutive seasons starting in 2015 - 16			2
even if that were to happen @entity0 would still bank £ 55m a year			0
@entity133 pays £ 10m a year for the right to be the club ’s official logistics partner			0
@entity156 signed a £ 2.4m deal with the club in 2012 to become the official @entity0 gaming partner , while @entity160 pays approximately £ 2m a year to be the club ’s official beer supplier			2
meanwhile , despite the promise of further @entity45 signings and the surprising decision to sell @entity167 to @entity168 for £ 16m , the club will continue to invest in local and young talent			0
moving on : @entity167 was sold to @entity168 on transfer deadline line for £ 16m promotion : @entity172 ( right ) has featured for @entity0 in their opening @entity2 games sources close to the club maintain that developing young players is still very much at the core of what the club and manager @entity30 will continue to do			1
the club point to the fact that four players ( @entity183 , @entity172 , @entity184 and @entity185 ) have been promoted from the youth team into the first team this season , while they have loaned another starlet , @entity189 , to @entity190 until january to gain first - team experience			0
