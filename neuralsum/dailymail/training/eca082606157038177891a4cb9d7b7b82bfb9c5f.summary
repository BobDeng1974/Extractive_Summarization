parents are putting their children at risk by ‘ conniving ’ with them to get on @entity3 , @entity5 ’s adviser on family issues has warned			1
@entity7 , the chief executive of the @entity8 , attacked the ‘ complicity of parents ’ who allow their young children to use social networking sites which are supposed to be for the over- 13s			1
it has led to the alarming situation where about 60 per cent of nine to 12 - year - olds have a social media presence , putting them in danger of being groomed by paedophiles or targeted with inappropriate advertising			1
concerns : parents are putting their children at risk by ' conniving ' with them to get on @entity3 , @entity5 's adviser on family issues has warned			2
this picture is posed by a model mr @entity7 , who wrote a high - profile report on the sexualisation of children for the prime minister in 2011 , said he was worried about the example such parents were setting about ‘ honesty ’			1
it came as a survey of more than 2,000 parents showed that 34 per cent do not believe it is their responsibility to teach their children about being safe online			2
the report , by @entity43 and technology firm @entity45 , also indicated that parents are in the dark about what their teenage children get up to online			0
speaking out : @entity7 , the chief executive of the @entity8 , pictured , attacked the ' complicity of parents ' who allow their young children to use social networking sites which are supposed to be for the over- 13s some 85 per cent said their children had not looked at porn online , even though @entity57 evidence shows the majority of 14 - year - old boys have accessed such content			1
mr @entity7 made his hard - hitting comments at a summit on child internet safety in @entity64 which was sponsored by @entity65 – after both @entity66 and @entity3 declined to take part			2
the @entity8 boss said : ‘ one of the problems i have is with the complicity of parents			0
' with social networking sites , the minimum age is 13 , and yet getting on for 60 per cent of children under the age of 13 have a social network presence			1
' this is sometimes with the tacit acceptance of parents and sometimes the active connivance of their parents			0
it worries me about what sort of message you ’re sending children about honesty			0
’ mr @entity7 told the @entity90 that many parents let their children go on @entity3 and other sites because their friends are on them and they do not want them to get left out			1
‘ the problem with this is that if the child is eight years old but they claim to be 13 to get online , the site is constantly assuming they are five years older than they are , ’ said mr @entity7			0
‘ so when they get to 13 , the site is assuming they are 18 and can then be targeted with advertising aimed at 18 - year - olds , including gambling sites , drink and so on			1
’ the summit at @entity64 ’s @entity109 was sponsored by @entity65 ’s @entity110 , an internet site used by more than 1million children each month			0
worrying : many parents let their children go on @entity3 and other sites because their friends are on them and they do not want their children to be left out but conference producer @entity116 said @entity3 and @entity66 declined an offer to sponsor the event or take part			2
she said : ‘ we struggled to secure sponsorship from @entity3 and @entity66 for the summit , despite telling them they would be communicating directly to teachers and parents			0
for me , their lack of representation speaks volumes			0
’ @entity129 , head of @entity110 in @entity130 , said : ‘ for parents , internet safety needs to be one of those life skills they need to pass on to their children , like teaching them to cross the road			0
