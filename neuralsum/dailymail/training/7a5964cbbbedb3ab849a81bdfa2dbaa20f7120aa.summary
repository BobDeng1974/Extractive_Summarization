twenty - five years ago , @entity0 was a man who ran a @entity2 educational center for @entity3 — a religious group that helps bring unaffiliated @entity5 closer to their faith			1
these days , she is doing a different sort of outreach — as a transgender activist and educator who preaches a message of truth and tolerance			1
the 63 - year - old @entity0 lives an active life in @entity2 , giving lectures on @entity17 , teaching part - time at a local seminary and discussing her book , forty years in the @entity22 : my journey to @entity25			1
her personal journey stands out , even in a country filled with people with stories of spirituality and self - discovery			2
journey : @entity0 was raised as @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , and was married with six children			1
in 2001 , at the age of 50 , she started a process culminating in surgery that transitioned her into a woman ' @entity43 wants all of us to be honest			2
and that 's really my message of the book , to give inspiration and strength to help people to move past their own inner demons , ' she said in an interview with the @entity54			2
raised as @entity34 in @entity35 , she became religious as an adult , joining @entity3 in 1975			1
she married , had six children with her then - wife , and spent time in @entity59 and the @entity60 before she said she helped run a @entity3 visitor center in @entity2 's @entity62 from 1985 to 1991			1
but all along , she kept a deep secret			2
going back to her childhood , she always knew she was a girl			2
@entity0 recalled that as a five - year - old boy , she was entranced watching her mother put on make - up			1
her mother once suggested she instead watch her father shave ' because you are a boy			2
' ' it was like , ' i 'm a boy ? wait			2
no. no. ' but i did n't say that to her			0
it was what i felt , ' she explained			0
during her years as a @entity3 activist , she said she hated herself			1
happier : @entity0 , pictured in 2012 , now gives lectures on @entity17 , teaching part - time at a local seminary and discussing her book , forty years in the @entity22 : my journey to @entity25 ' yet i so wanted to live a spiritual life			1
so i was always making deals			0
i was making deals with @entity43 ... " i will put on the costume , but please work with me			0
help me , " ' she said			0
eventually , she parted ways with the movement , divorced , and in 2001 , at the age of 50 , started a four - year process culminating with surgery that transitioned her into a woman			0
she chose the biblical name @entity0 , which she said means to ' behold ' and to ' see into the present more deeply			1
' during the interview in her small @entity2 apartment , @entity0 wore lipstick , a purple dress , encrusted glasses , a large blue necklace and a smaller one with a @entity105			1
she showed old passport pictures of her bearded former self , before her transition			0
she declined to discuss her relationship with her children and grandchildren			1
@entity0 still leads a lifestyle of a devout @entity114 , eating only kosher food , refraining from travel on the @entity117 and praying at the @entity118 — albeit in the section reserved for women			1
in the conservative @entity121 , @entity59 is famously tolerant of gays and transgenders			0
gays have openly served in @entity59 's military and parliament			0
the @entity127 grants a variety of family rights to gay couples , and gays , lesbians and a transsexual are among the country 's most popular musicians and actors			0
last year , the country opened a memorial to gays who died in the @entity140			0
the challenges of living a transgender life have gained awareness through the popularity of @entity146 's series @entity147			2
the show , which focuses on a man in the process of transitioning to a woman who comes out to his adult children , won two @entity154 earlier this month			1
despite this tolerance , the conservative world of @entity156 is not always so accepting , making @entity0 's openness about her story even more striking			1
new life : @entity0 ( pictured in june 2014 , left , and july 2012 , right ) has no regrets about her sex change @entity165 , an @entity166 educator and commentator , said there is no mention in @entity5 texts of the issue of gender changes ' because it 's a modern thing			1
' he said that many @entity166 consider it an ' abomination ' and prefer not to think about it because it is difficult for them to fathom			0
but rabbi @entity177 , an expert of liturgy and biblical literature at the @entity180 , which is affiliated with the liberal reform movement , said gender stereotypes are not always clear in the @entity183			0
' the liberal streams ( of @entity17 ) acknowledge the fact that maybe some people are born in the wrong skin , and they have the right and maybe the duty to search for their own identity , ' she said			2
' then the @entity5 religion and @entity5 leaders have to help them find their way into this new reality that they created for themselves			0
' @entity3 did not immediately return a message from the @entity54 seeking comment			0
@entity0 said she has no regrets about her decision			1
' i could n't change my soul ... there is no surgery for your soul like a heart transplant , ' she said			0
' but you can get a different body , and thank @entity43 today			0
one - hundred years ago , i do n't know what i would have done			0

@entity0 , now 63 , was born @entity34 and became religious as an adult
@entity0 , now a transgender activist , still leads an @entity156 lifestyle in her new home of @entity2
she would not discuss her relationship with her children and grandchildren
