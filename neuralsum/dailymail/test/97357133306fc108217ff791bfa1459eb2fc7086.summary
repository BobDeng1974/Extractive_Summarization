a @entity1 athlete has become the fastest man to run 16,300 miles around the world despite being attacked by bears , hunted by packs of wild dogs , and run over twice			1
@entity7 , 34 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , ran more than a marathon a day every day for almost two years , crossing 26 countries and getting through 16 pairs of shoes to complete the feat. he began his epic voyage at @entity16 on @entity17 in july 2013 and returned yesterday after 621 days , one quicker than the previous record , held by @entity20 @entity19			1
he said : ' i 've pushed my tired legs through most of @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity20 , @entity44 , @entity45 and the @entity46			1
' i have encountered some pretty scary things along the way , from packs of wilds dogs in @entity51 to the most extreme weather conditions imaginable			2
' most frightening of all however was coming face to face with bears			2
one of the bears stalked and then actively came for me			2
mr @entity7 's journey took him through @entity20 , @entity44 , @entity42 , @entity43 , the @entity46 and @entity45 - though he said the highlight was the @entity58 mountains mr @entity7 pushes his buggy full of equipment , which weighed twice as much as him , through @entity61 in @entity44 during the middle of his adventure the route took mr @entity7 through most of @entity42 , including @entity65 ( pictured )			1
after crossing the finish line he said he had lost three stone during the trip ' i used bear banger explosives that someone had given me and , after three misfires , thankfully my fourth attempt sent the bear packing			1
' he said during one 300 - mile stretch full of bears and wolves he relied on people with short - distance radios to keep a check on him to make sure he was n't eaten			0
he added : ' i 've had to endure a lot of suffering too			0
i had severe heatstroke in @entity43 and have twice been hit by cars			0
' i knew the size of the challenge but it was a little bit more of a headache dealing with the logistics and the traffic			0
mr @entity7 's trip also took in @entity94 - not the capital of @entity96 , but a tiny town in @entity98 , with a population of just 66 mr @entity7 takes in the scenery by a river in @entity102 , showing the pedometer on his wrist that he used to keep track of his speed , distance , and route the voyage took him to locations all over the world , from @entity112 , @entity46 ( left ) , to @entity113 , @entity114 ( right ) ' it was a bit harder than i had anticipated and took me a bit longer			1
' i did n't have much time to lament on loneliness as i was concentrating on the traffic and where i was going to sleep that night and find a shop			0
' the worst thing i faced was indifference from fashion savvy people looking at a sweaty dishevelled man pushing a pram down the road			0
