@entity0 headed for his 60th birthday celebrations with @entity2 occupying a @entity4 place and the veteran manager admitting that he is too long in the tooth to fret over his @entity8 future			1
when @entity0 was given a stay of execution by the club ’s owners in may it was on the basis that he served up more attacking football			1
five months on and @entity0 has delivered with a little help from a summer signing who has scored six goals in six games			1
now the manager is being asked about @entity22 rather than the sack			2

@entity0 has seen it all before			2
‘ when you ’ve got 13 years in the @entity93 and 20 years in the manager ’s job , the anxiety of contracts is not a great hardship , ’ he said			0
‘ if there is a turn in fortunes , i ’ve still done a fantastic job and life will move on			0
’ it is more than a decade since @entity0 demonstrated the pressures of football management by wearing a heart monitor on the touchline for a television documentary and five years since he had cardiac surgery to remove an arterial blockage			2
he is a changed man			0
‘ i do n’t feel the pressure as much , ’ he said			0
‘ you learn to deal with it			0
i ’ve proved myself at this level a long time ago and that makes life all the more enjoyable and you can be less worried about things that go against you			0
’ @entity2 proved that at @entity33 , weathering a difficult first half against a @entity26 side desperate for their first win of the season before scoring three second - half goals to move up to fourth place			1
@entity22 maintained his remarkable record since a £ 3.5million summer move from @entity126 and was involved in the other goals for @entity128 and @entity68			1
@entity0 bristles at the suggestion that @entity2 ’s style is significantly different this season , but the fans who wanted him out have certainly gone quiet			1
@entity128 's thumping header gave @entity2 a 2 - 0 lead at @entity26 on saturday @entity0 looks on from the touchline during the first half of @entity2 's game at @entity26 and the @entity2 gaffer was all smiles at the final whistle as his side moved into the top four @entity68 can not hide his delight as he celebrates in front of the rapturous @entity2 faithful at @entity33 on saturday this was the first time a @entity93 team has scored with three headers in one game since @entity150 managed it against @entity151 nearly three years ago			1
having won his fourth @entity93 game in eight , @entity0 needed to overcome another challenge , this time from wife @entity154 , before his birthday celebrations			1
‘ there was a big debate between us about whether it should be a large party , ’ he revealed			0
‘ not being that pleased about being 60 , i said it would be small so it ’s with very close personal friends			0
‘ then on sunday it ’s all the family — son , daughter , the grandchildren			0
i ’ll really have a very good weekend now			0
’ the same could not be said for @entity26 after eight games without a win			1
@entity47 scored their goal but @entity26 failed to make the most of their chances			2
‘ it ’s devastating , ’ said @entity47			0
‘ but i have no doubt we ’ll get the goals which will be enough to keep us in the division			0
’ @entity178 strikers delivered - @entity0			1

@entity2 moved into the top four after beating @entity26 on saturday
@entity22 set the @entity2 on the way to an *encouraging* 3 - 1 win on the eve of @entity0 's 60th birthday
after receiving much *criticism* last season @entity0 has *completed* a remarkable *turnaround* at @entity8
he *insists* he has no concerns over his future at the club though
