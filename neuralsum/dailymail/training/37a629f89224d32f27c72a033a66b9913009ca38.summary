a smart home full of devices connected to each other , as well as domestic robots are closer than we think , according to one futurologist			1
this year has seen a rush in the popularity of smart gadgets , with items like 3d printers and smart thermostats making it onto @entity14 lists for the first time			1
the trend is a sign of the way technology will accelerate in 2015 , according to @entity21 - based futurologist dr @entity20			1
technology giant @entity28 already has a domestic robot , @entity30 ( left )			0
@entity31 dr @entity20 ( right ) claims the technology could be closer than we think ' the centrepiece of our future is the @entity37 home , which is rapidly becoming the digital hub for our increasingly connected lives , ' he said			1
' our homes are set to be enriched further by energy ; from high - tech gadgets and appliances to smart devices			1
' dr @entity20 was commenting on the release of a report by energy company @entity48 , which showed that the average home was transforming , as consumer buying habits changed			1
the @entity52 report found that in 2015 , the most wanted products will be 3d printers , followed by smart devices that connect to our phones - primarily thermostats and security systems , as well as solar - powered chargers			1
future of food ? 3d printers such as @entity62 ( pictured ) could change the way we prepare our meals			0
they are set to become more mainstream , according to a recent study 3d printing is a technology moving further into the mainstream , with the first artificial limbs created from 3d printers being used on patients this year			0
not only are the devices now on sale in retailers , but there are multiple mobile apps that enable users to create and buy figures and toys that are printed in @entity83			2
' @entity83 has been described as the biggest economic revolution since @entity85 introduced production line manufacturing in the 1900s , ' dr @entity20 said			1
' @entity88 already use it to turn out rocket parts ; they are also developing ways to deploy 3d technology to produce on - board meals for the manned @entity95 missions planned for 2030 and beyond			0
bright idea : the @entity52 report found that in 2015 , the most wanted products will be 3d printers , followed by smart devices that connect to our phones			1

' the cost of a printer is falling rapidly - a starter version sells for less than £ 500 ( $ 777 ) - and they are incredibly versatile			0
' printing a new smartphone case takes about 30 minutes - then there are toys , handles , chess pieces , replacements parts for every domestic gadget			2
' then there 's food			0

@entity228 @entity37 president @entity227 said earlier this year : ' there has been a huge change in the way the connected world is established , and so to take that forward 10 years it 's interesting to note that the main trend we believe by then will be the connected home			2

its designers launched the product on @entity246 earlier this year			0

comments were made by @entity21 - based futurologist dr @entity20
he says more people will *opt* for mobile phone - controlled smart devices
many of these devices will be home - based , such as smart thermostats
domestic robots are the product people are most looking forward to
dr @entity20 added that we were beginning to see the phasing out of ' traditional ' technologies , such as the tv set and landline phones
