she was one of the great stars of @entity3 ’s golden age and shared a kiss with @entity5 in @entity6			1
but mystery has always surrounded @entity9 ’s early life , not least because of the version of events given by the actress herself			2
she claimed she was born in @entity14 and then moved to @entity15 to live with her aristocratic godparents after her distinguished father died in a hunting accident			1
her @entity20 entry in the 1970s listed her birthplace as @entity14 and her father as a @entity24 officer			1
dark secret : @entity9 was a @entity3 great and appeared with @entity5 in @entity6 ( 1939 ) , left			1
but the woman she thought was her sister actually gave birth to her aged 12 a dark moor haunted by secrets : the actress with @entity5 in @entity6 it 's complicated : @entity9 's mother , @entity33 , was the 12 - year - old daughter of @entity9 's father 's girlfriend now , however , records have been published that confirm for the first time that she was actually born in @entity15 – and that the woman she knew as her sister was really her mother			1
a project between the @entity42 and ancestry website findmypast.co.uk has published records from the time of the @entity46 online , including @entity9 ’s birth certificate			2
it shows she was born @entity9 in 1911 in @entity49 and her father , @entity50 , was a railway engineer from @entity51 rather than an army officer			1
it names her mother as @entity33 , who was only 12 at the time of the birth			1
controversially , @entity33 was the daughter of @entity50 ’s girlfriend @entity57			1
@entity58 , a @entity59 from @entity60 with partial @entity62 heritage , had had @entity63 by an @entity65 tea planter when she herself was only 14 and living in @entity60			0
glitz : @entity9 died in 1979 and took the secret to her grave , saying her father had been a distinguished @entity24 man starlet : @entity9 in @entity72 ( 1941 ) with @entity73			1
she continued acting in @entity3 throughout the @entity74 , sometimes in propaganda films @entity58 was around 26 when @entity9 was born and raised her as her own			2
the girl grew up thinking @entity33 was her sister rather than her mother			1
in 1914 @entity50 joined the @entity24 and later died of pneumonia on the @entity79 during the @entity80			2
literary inspiration : as @entity82 in @entity6 with @entity5 as @entity83 @entity33 went on to marry a man called @entity85 and had four other children , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			2
all grew up believing @entity9 was their aunt rather than their half - sister			1
her brother @entity89 discovered the truth and tried to organise a meeting with her , but she refused to see him			0
throughout her successful career @entity9 , who died in 1979 , lied about her mixed - race heritage , a controversial subject at the time			1
she became famous for her roles in @entity3 and @entity102 films of the 1930s and 1940s such as @entity104 and @entity105 she was nominated for the best actress @entity106 for @entity108 in 1935			2
her career peaked as @entity82 in @entity6 in 1939			0
she married four times , had a relationship with actor @entity112 and had two children			0
but she could never bring herself to admit to her heritage and told everyone that she was born in @entity14 – which back then must have seemed so removed from @entity117 and the @entity118 that her secret would not be discovered			0
she claimed that all early records of her birth were destroyed in a fire			0
in 1978 she even accepted an invitation to the @entity14 capital @entity125 to see her ‘ birthplace ’			0
however , the story began to come out as friends remembered her growing up in @entity49 , now @entity49			0
her birth certificate is among 2.5million records covering 200 years of @entity102 rule in @entity15 which are being made available online for the first time			0
they can be viewed by purchasing a findmypast.co.uk subscription or pay - as - you - go credits			0
@entity138 fashion : the actress was glamorous in her later years , when she travelled the world			0
she died in 1979 pre-war : @entity9 starred in @entity142 ( 1934 ) alongside @entity143 in cinema 's golden age			0

actress shared famous kiss with @entity5 in a long @entity3 career
she always said her @entity24 officer father had died in a hunting accident
but new records show her father was a railway engineer from @entity51
he had @entity9 by the 12 - year - old daughter of his then - girlfriend
so @entity9 grew up thinking @entity33 was her sister , not her mother
