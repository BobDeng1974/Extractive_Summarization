overhaul call : @entity2 chairman chairman @entity1 said it was ' unacceptable ' that more than half of @entity6 medallists at the @entity7 came from private schools the high proportion of privately - educated @entity6 medallists is ‘ unacceptable ’ , the chairman of the @entity2 said yesterday			1
just 7 per cent of the population go to independent schools – but more than half of @entity16 ’s golds in the @entity7 were won by former private school pupils			1
so far , @entity6 has nine gold medallists in the @entity19			2
four were privately educated , and a fifth went to school in @entity22			1
@entity2 chief @entity1 , himself a former public schoolboy , called for an overhaul of school sport policy to provide more chances for state pupils			1
‘ it ’s one of the worst statistics in @entity16 sport , ’ he claimed			1
‘ it is wholly unacceptable that over 50 per cent of our medallists in @entity34 came from the private sector			1
‘ it tells you that 50 per cent of the medals came from 7 per cent of the population			1
‘ there is so much talent out there in the 93 per cent that should be identified and developed			0
that has got to be a priority for future sports policy			0
‘ i have spoken about it many times and i will continue to speak about it until there is not breath left in me			0
’ the @entity53 peer continued : ‘ the balance of professional football is that around 7 per cent of players come from the private sector , which is an absolute mirror image of society			1
‘ that should be the case in every single sport , and that should be the priority in each and every sport , and that is something that every government should strive for			1
’ at the previous @entity68 , a third of @entity6 went to independent schools			2
they included multiple gold medallist sir @entity71 , who attended @entity72 in @entity73 , and every equestrian medallist			0
non-state schools can afford to devote more time to sport			2
they usually have better facilities and often boast top - class coaches			0
champion : multiple gold medal cyclist sir @entity71 , pictured with his wife @entity81 after winning the men 's team sprint yesterday , was provately educated at @entity72 in @entity73 pledge : @entity84 , pictured here watching the sprint cycling at the @entity86 with prince @entity87 , said billions would be spent on state school sport over the next five years the discrepancy is especially noticeable in sports whose basic entry costs are high , such as equestrian events and sailing			1
rowing has already taken action to address the imbalance , with @entity98 , who won bronze in the men ’s eight on wednesday , among the beneficiaries			2
the @entity104 programme , launched more than a decade ago , has encouraged rowing coaches to visit comprehensive schools and scout teenagers with the necessary physique to become elite rowers			0
as a result , half of @entity6 ’s rowers at the @entity112 are from state schools			2
when asked if too many medals were being won by former public school pupils , @entity84 said : ‘ we need to spend on state school sport and we are spending a billion pounds over the next five years			1
‘ we need to make sure people have those opportunities			0
frankly , one of the best things will be the @entity68 and the legacy and the inspiration for young people to take part			0
’ @entity53 mp @entity126 said the statistics were ‘ really , really worrying ’			2
she told @entity128 ’s @entity130 programme that state schools were often reluctant to promote competition			0
‘ there ’s a massive problem with sports and facilities in our schools , but it ’s also a much deeper problem , ’ she said			0
‘ i wonder if it ’s a problem to do with culture			0
the reason the private sector does well in education is that it ’s very unapologetic about competition – there are winners and there are losers – and this is certainly not the case for all state schools			0

just 7 *%* of the @entity16 population are educated at independent *institutions*
yet more than half of @entity34 golds were won by *ex-private* school pupils
