painted with cartoon characters and strewn with moss , these are the crumbling remains of a psychiatric hospital which has lain derelict for 15 years			1
upturned chairs and tables are strewn across the waterlogged floors of @entity7 , which was a secluded home for mental health patients in the @entity10 for almost 100 years			1
opened in 1903 , it was designed to be self - sufficient with private water , electricity , heating and sewerage systems , along with a farm where patients - many of whom were misunderstood and would never be allowed to leave - grew their own food			1
despite the passage of time and two new owners , @entity50 tapes are still left spilling out of a broken cardboard box , while other images show wallpaper peeling away from the slime - covered walls			1
there were failed plans to turn the 11 - acre site into a business park until it was sold on to developer @entity30 for £ 720,000 in march 2011			1
his grand scheme was to build 100 houses and a care home on the site of the hospital - but mr @entity30 , of @entity65 , @entity66 , was defeated by angry neighbours who said it would compromise the beauty of the national park			2
supported by groups including @entity72 , the @entity73 rejected his bid to demolish the hospital two years ago and it now sits in limbo , full of asbestos			0
archaic : parts of the dirty floor are strewn with abandoned @entity50 tapes which have spilled out of a water - damaged cardboard box controversy : there were plans to turn the 11 - acre site into 100 houses and a care home , but they were seen off by furious neighbours the doctor will see you now : empty chairs sit unclaimed in the old consulting rooms and offices , surrounded by moss and peeling paint crumbling : parts of the @entity99 building have disintegrated since the closure of the @entity39 hospital , which once had its own farm the campaigners have since taken @entity106 ' @entity105 politicians round the site , which is now a stomping ground for urban explorers , in a bid to show how crucial it is to the nation 's history			1
but mr @entity30 has said it was ' completely mad ' to prevent the hospital being knocked down - especially as it has failed to be listed by @entity114 , the @entity106 equivalent of @entity116			2
he added : ' the petition is being driven by a small group of people working together and who prepare a petition simply because they do not want something to happen			0
the petition is highly simplistic as it only offers one viewpoint ... with no knowledge of the site			0
' originally called the @entity73 and @entity128 , the hospital was built for £ 126,000 and opened in march 1903			2
performing the opening ceremony , lord @entity129 reportedly said : ' everything has been done that human ingenuity could devise for the happiness and safety of the inmates , and under the blessing of @entity137 , for their speedy restoration to health			0
' the hospital had residential wards , a large recreation and dining hall , kitchens , workshops and a tailor , bakery and shoe - maker			0
by 1914 , it was one of 102 registered ' lunatic asylums ' across @entity153 , many of them beautifully - designed @entity156 buildings			1
theatrics : the fully - functional psychiatric hospital once cared for hundreds of patients and has a stage on which they could perform eerie : the brickwork is exposed in the corridors , left to rack and ruin as developers tried first to build a business park , then 100 homes ramshackle : the hospital was under the control of the @entity39 for 51 years , bringing with it art , occupational therapy and mixed - sex wards messy : the hospital was also home to the @entity174 and an alcohol and drug abuse clinic the @entity73 asylum was even noted for its large windows , which gave patients wide views over the beautiful @entity106 countryside			1
but @entity153 's attitude to mental health was far from idyllic - with fewer than half of patients being discharged from ' asylums ' , with many misunderstood by the authorities or given controversial treatments such as electric shock therapy			1
in 1948 the hospital became part of the newly - formed @entity39 , bringing with it art , occupational therapy and the integration of the sexes , who had occupied opposite sides of the symmetrical complex			0
the site also became home to the @entity174 and the @entity202 for substance misuse			0
when the derelict building was given a reprieve , @entity72 president @entity204 said : ‘ the nation ’s disused mental hospitals have been the focus of one of our longest and most sustained campaigns			2
' many were designed by leading architects , very well - built of very excellent materials and sited on south - facing slopes to enjoy maximum fresh air and sunlight			0
all over @entity153 , one developer after another has proved they can be successfully converted			0
’ snub : despite protests by history - lovers , the building failed in its bid to be listed by @entity114 , the @entity106 equivalent of @entity116 history : the hospital pictured in the days when it was fully operational			2
it was built to afford wide views over the @entity10			0

there were failed attempts to turn derelict @entity7 in @entity10 into homes and a business park
it opened in 1903 and was one of more than 100 ' lunatic asylums ' in @entity153 - but lost out because of rural location
crumbling building littered with moss , debris and @entity50 tapes has since become a stomping ground for explorers
