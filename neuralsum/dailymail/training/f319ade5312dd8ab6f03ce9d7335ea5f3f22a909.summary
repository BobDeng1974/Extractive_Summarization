by @entity0 one is famous for his passion for the environment , his blue - blooded ancestry and multimillion pound bank balance			0
the other is prince @entity7			1
it was a meeting of minds as tv chef @entity10 gave the famously green prince @entity7 a tour of @entity12 in the @entity14 town of @entity15 today			1
during the visit , the heir to the throne was shown how to forage for food before being given a guided tour of @entity10 's vegetable patch - much to @entity7 ' delight			1
she too appeared to enjoy meeting @entity33 and at one point , was seen bursting into laughter as they chatted			2
the royal couple were at @entity12 on day two of their annual tour of @entity14 and @entity40 to hear more about one of @entity10 's eco-friendly schemes - @entity42			1
while making his tv series @entity46 which aired in 2008 , the chef helped a group of @entity49 families start a smallholding on derelict council land			2
growing nicely : @entity26 gets a fit of the giggles as she contemplates a pea plant in the @entity12 garden can you eat that ? @entity26 gets some foraging tips from the tv chef turned environmental campaigner one is not eating that one ! @entity26 comes face to face with a pungent plant at @entity12 although @entity10 's successful @entity65 campaign is over , other issues remain			1
most pressing is that of fish stocks , with seabass , razor clams and halibut among the species with perilously low numbers			0
other types , among them pollock , mackerel and anchovies , are fine to eat - for now			0
fishing methods have also come under increased scrutiny , with purse seine nets blamed for the deaths of thousands of dolphins			0
@entity33 has now added his name to the list of advocates for low impact line fishing as well as marine conservation zones			2
for more information , see the @entity90 website			0
so inspiring did the experience prove , he decided to see if it would work nationwide , and @entity94 , which now includes more than 50,000 people , was created to bring keen growers and landowners together			0
the @entity7 , who has long championed the merits of smallholding , and mr @entity10 share yet more common ground when it comes to farming			2
a keen supporter of all things organic , the prince has an eco-friendly farm at @entity107 in @entity108 , while mr @entity10 's @entity12 smallholding - which includes vegetables , pigs and hens - is run along green lines			1
both men also share a passion for fishing , with prince @entity7 supporting charities such as @entity118 and @entity10 's own fish fight campaign			1
the latter , heavily promoted on tv and backed by environmental charities , was aimed at ending the wasteful practice of discarding perfectly good fish as a result of @entity128 quotas and encouraging supermarkets and other retailers to switch to sustainably sourced seafood			0
although the @entity128 has now introduced rules that outlaw discards , other problems such as the use of dolphin killing purse seine fishing nets and plummeting fish stocks remain			0
fun : an animated @entity26 appeared to enjoy herself as she chatted to @entity7 and @entity10 - @entity10 all smiles : @entity26 and @entity10 burst into laughter as they tour @entity12 tasty : @entity12 student @entity143 gives prince @entity7 and @entity10 cooking tips can one forage at @entity107 ? prince @entity7 and @entity26 get a lesson in wild food from @entity10 - @entity10 environment : both prince @entity7 and mr @entity10 are known for their passion for all things green			1
