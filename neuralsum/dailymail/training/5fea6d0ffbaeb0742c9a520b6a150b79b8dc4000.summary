image shows an artist 's impression of the hepatitis c virus at least 3,000 former patients are being contacted by letter informing them of the risk and a series of confidential helplines and a support service have been set up			1
several hundred patients in other areas of @entity16 who may have come into contact with the health worker are also being contacted			1
in @entity36 , about 400 former patients are being contacted , while urgent steps are being taken to check historic patient records in @entity39 and @entity40			2
‘ it has recently come to light that the healthcare worker is known to have transmitted the virus to two patients while working at a hospital in @entity16 from 1984 until they ceased clinical practice in 2002 , ’ a @entity16 spokesman said			1
‘ a “ lookback ” patient notification exercise involving the review of at least 3,000 former hospital patients ’ notes and records from the @entity51 has been announced by the @entity52 today			2
‘ around 200 former hospital patients from two other hospitals in @entity16 where the healthcare worker practised for a short time are also being contacted			1
‘ those patients identified as exposed or possibly exposed to @entity3 are being sent individual letters and asked to call a special confidential helpline , inviting them to attend a hospital clinic or , if they have moved away from the area , their gp for a blood test			0
’ @entity36 - from september 1975 until december 1983 : @entity16 - up until 2003 : @entity40 - from january to november 1979 : @entity39 - from march 25 to july 3 1981 : he added : ‘ effective treatments are available for @entity3 and further information and advice will also be provided to anyone who needs it			1
‘ there is only a small chance that a patient might acquire hepatitis c virus infection through surgical contact with an infected healthcare worker			1
‘ the risk is very low as this can only occur if the healthcare worker is infectious and leads or assists in an operation or procedure on the patient			1
however , even in such circumstances transmission is very rare			0
’ the healthcare worker is known to have worked at other hospitals across the @entity6 prior to working in @entity16 , including 11 hospitals in @entity36 from 1975 to 1983			1
‘ similar “ lookback ” exercises are taking place in parallel across all the hospitals in @entity36 , @entity39 and @entity40 where the healthcare worker practised , ’ the spokesman said			1
‘ less than 400 women in @entity36 have so far been identified as having definitely or possibly had operations conducted by the affected healthcare worker			1
‘ they will be contacted directly by letter inviting them to call a confidential helpline , to discuss whether they would like to have a blood test arranged at their gp practice			0
’ as it has been almost 30 years since the individual worked in hospitals in @entity36 , records of women who may be at risk are in some cases incomplete , for example if the hospital has been renamed or patients have moved around the country , @entity104 said			1
in @entity36 , the helpline and support service ( 0800 121 4400 ) will also be in place from thursday , for any woman who is concerned because they had an obstetric or gynaecological operation , or they gave birth , at one of the 11 hospitals during the specified periods			0
dr @entity124 , medical director at @entity104 , said : ‘ we have worked hard to identify women in @entity36 who might have been at risk of contracting infection with @entity3 from this healthcare worker and are contacting them to offer advice and a blood test for @entity3 , should they wish to have one			1
‘ i want to emphasise that the risk of infection is very small and that we are offering them testing purely as a precaution			0
‘ around one in 250 adults in @entity36 have chronic hepatitis c infection and it does not automatically lead to health problems			0
‘ treatment can help clear the infection in up to 80 per cent of cases , which is why it ’s important to identify anyone who may be at risk of having been infected so treatment can be started if necessary			0
’ a ' lookback ' patient notification exercise involving the review of at least 3,000 former hospital patients ' notes and records from the @entity51 ( pictured ) has been announced the healthcare worker in question was infected with @entity3 but , in kind with most cases , suffered no symptoms and was unaware of the infection			1
as soon as the risk of infection was recognised , and a transmission was confirmed , a process of tracing their occupational history began , @entity104 said			0
@entity3 is a virus which can lead to inflammation of the liver and cause chronic liver disease and , very rarely if untreated , cancer of the liver			0
most people are unaware of their infection because the liver can still operate when damaged and the virus does not cause any symptoms			0
it is often only when the liver becomes seriously damaged and symptoms occur that people visit their gp			0
antiviral therapies can clear the virus in many cases			0
it is transmitted through blood - to - blood contact , and very rarely through sexual intercourse			2
infection is not possible through social contact , kissing or sharing food and drink			0
in the @entity6 , sharing of equipment by intravenous drug users is the commonest form of infection with hepatitis @entity190 about 10,000 new hepatitis c diagnoses are made in @entity36 each year and around 160,000 adults in @entity36 are estimated to be living with a chronic infection			2
since 2007 , all healthcare workers who are new to the @entity4 are tested for @entity3 by their employing @entity196 , including anyone performing certain procedures ( known as exposure prone procedures )			0
