by @entity0 failure : a task force chaired by @entity3 said the policy of treating different cultures as ¿ separate and distinct ¿ had been a ¿ mistake timid politicians with a ‘ misplaced ’ fear of offending @entity10 have allowed @entity12 extremism to take root in the institutions of @entity15 , the prime minister warned yesterday			1
a task force chaired by @entity3 said the policy of treating different cultures as ‘ separate and distinct ’ – known as multiculturalism – had been a ‘ mistake ’			1
the panel said it was far easier to combat the fanaticism that leads to terrorism when different communities ‘ come together to challenge it ’			2
yesterday ’s report – a response to the killing of soldier @entity27 in @entity28 – was scathing about the ‘ reticence ’ of politicians to confront @entity10			1
it was published by @entity32 on behalf of mr @entity3 , deputy prime minister @entity33 and a string of other senior cabinet ministers			0
the report gives a stark warning of how – by being afraid to challenge hard - line views – politicians had allowed fanaticism to take root in a string of @entity15 institutions			2
it says : ‘ the government , as much as organisations and communities in the @entity15 , must take responsibility			2
‘ we have been too reticent about challenging extreme @entity12 ideologies in the past , in part because of a misplaced concern that attacking @entity12 extremism equates to an attack on @entity10 itself			2
this reticence , and the failure to confront extremists , has led to an environment conducive to radicalisation in some mosques and @entity10 centres , universities and prisons			1
’ for three decades , @entity63 promoted a strategy of multiculturalism that mr @entity3 has previously described as ‘ encouraging different cultures to live separate lives , apart from each other and apart from the mainstream ’			2
the task force , which the @entity71 personally chaired , warns this was a ‘ mistake ’			1
it says : ‘ extremism is less likely to be tolerated by communities which come together to challenge it			0
‘ @entity15 is stronger because of its open , multi-faith and multi-racial communities , which can tackle extremists together and challenge the view that it is not possible to be a true @entity82 and be integrated in @entity15 society			0
‘ approaches in the past that , on occasion , sought to deal with different communities as separate and distinct , were mistaken			0
’ mr @entity3 called on the government and wider society to ‘ take action to confront extremism in all its forms , whether in our communities , schools , prisons , @entity10 centres or universities ’			1
danger : in 2004 @entity101 , chairman of the @entity102 now the @entity100 warned @entity15 was in danger of sleepwalking into segregation he said yesterday : ‘ i have been absolutely clear that this is not something we should be afraid to address for fear of cultural sensitivities			0
’ the task force is recommending new civil powers – dubbed ‘ @entity112 ’ , or terror and extremism behaviour orders – to target extremists			1
they could be used to bar people from preaching messages of terror and hate , associating with named individuals thought vulnerable to radicalisation , and from entering specific venues such as mosques or community halls			0
ministers also want new internet filters to block extremist websites and extended powers for watchdogs to shut down charities suspected of being fronts for extremist groups			0
the government is also introducing a new definition of extremism which specifically includes a ‘ distorted interpretation of @entity10 ’ which argues against ‘ liberal values such as democracy , the rule of law and equality ’			1
in 2004 @entity101 , chairman of the @entity102 – now the @entity100 – said multiculturalism was out of date because it ‘ suggests separateness ’			0
he warned that @entity15 was sleepwalking into segregation .			0
