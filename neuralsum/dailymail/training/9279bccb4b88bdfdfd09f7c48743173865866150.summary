men feel more attractive once their partners have given birth , scientists at @entity1 suggest women may get a glow during pregnancy , but now it turns out that men feel they are more attractive as well - only after the baby has arrived			1
in the first study of its kind , men said that their self image improved after the birth in what is being called a ‘ hidden benefit ’ of becoming a dad			1
the scientists said that men could get the boost because they feel they they are more masculine having just seen a mini version of themselves enter the world			1
they could also get a kick out of women cooing over them as they walk around with their baby			1
women by contrast did not experience such a lift about their appearance - possibly because the physical demands of raising a child left them a shadow of what they used to be			1
the study examined 182 people who were all newlywed adults with an average age of 24 for a women and 26 for a man			0
they asked them to give their verdict on their own wellbeing and appearance at the start of the study , the one year anniversary and the second anniversary			0
one question asked them to rate how attractive they found themselves on a scale of one to 10 and how ordinary they thought they were on a scale of one to five			0
for men who did n’t have children , notions of attractiveness remained stable			0
but those who became fathers during the study ’s timeframe felt more attractive after their child was born than they did previously			0
lead researcher @entity64 , an associate professor the @entity1 , said : ‘ i was talking about this paper with my husband and he commented on the attention he got when he was seen in public holding our son after he was born			2
one theory suggests men feel more masculine having helped create a child in their own image ‘ like : " are n’t you a good dad " , " look at that new dad with his baby "			1
' ' women get that feedback , too , because everybody loves a new baby			2
but that ( benefit ) may be countered by other things she ’s experiencing that he ’s not , in terms of how her body has changed and being more physically tired			0
‘ there ’s a lot of attention paid to how women think about themselves – particularly their bodies and their physical attractiveness – after childbirth			0
‘ but to our knowledge there ’s been nothing that looked at men ’			0
it is a possibility that men feel more attractive because of the attention they get from women when toting a new baby around @entity106 , professor emeritus of family studies at the @entity108 , who was not involved in the research , added that it was an ‘ intriguing idea ’			1
he said : ‘ whereas some women experience postpartum depression , some men experience a postpartum glow			2

scientists at @entity1 discover men *'s* self - image *hugely* boosted after birth of their baby
one theory suggests they feel more masculine having created a child in their own image
another possibility is they like women cooing over them when they *'re* carrying the baby around
