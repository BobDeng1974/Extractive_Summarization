a breast cancer test which could save thousands of women the ordeal of chemotherapy is to be made available on the @entity4			1
the test can accurately predict the chances of a tumour returning once it has been removed by surgery			1
from today , doctors will be urged by the @entity4 rationing body @entity10 to offer women the test , called @entity14 , to check whether they really need chemotherapy			1
thousands of women with breast cancer could be spared chemotherapy every year thanks to a test which has been approved for use on the @entity4 at present , about half of the 48,000 women diagnosed with breast cancer in the @entity24 every year undergo a course of this debilitating treatment after the tumours are taken out			1
this is meant to eradicate any cancer cells that have broken away from the main tumour , which could cause the illness to spread to other parts of the body			1
but many women with the illness have a very low - risk form that is unlikely to spread			2
experts estimate that between 4,000 and 5,000 women a year with this low - risk breast cancer are needlessly being put through exhausting chemotherapy			2
it usually lasts three to six months and causes hair loss , sickness and tiredness and may leave women permanently infertile			0
but from now on , doctors will be urged to offer women the test – which costs £ 2,580 a time – whenever they are uncertain about the risk of the cancer returning			1
in three quarters of cases , doctors can estimate how likely the tumour is to return just by looking at its size and how quickly it has grown			1
the genetic test could benefit those with early - stage breast cancer facing the intensive treatment , which has side effects include nausea , vomiting , insomnia , hair loss and fatigue but the remainder of women ( about 9,000 a year ) have what is termed ‘ intermediate - risk ’ cancer and it is very difficult for doctors to assess it			1
nearly all of these women are given chemotherapy just in case even though about half may not need it			2
the new test works by analysing small samples of the tumour after surgery			2
the samples will be posted by doctors to a lab in @entity86 , @entity87 , where they are put through a machine that closely looks at 21 genes			2
studies have suggested that half of women with the most common form of early breast cancer could be spared chemotherapy			0
image shows breast cancer cells the machine then comes up with a score of between zero and 100 based on the chance of the tumour returning			0
patients who score zero to 18 will be told they do n’t need chemotherapy while those over 31 will be urged to have the treatment			0
when patients get a score of between 18 and 31 , doctors will use their own discretion			0
professor @entity110 of the @entity111 at @entity10 , said : ‘ breast cancer patients face significant emotional and psychological strain when considering chemotherapy			1
‘ a test that can help to predict better the risk of the breast cancer spreading , and therefore the potential likely benefit of additional chemotherapy , represents a significant step forward for patients			0
’ @entity122 , senior policy officer at @entity123 , said : ‘ this is a good decision from @entity10			0
’ recently other researchers have developed far cheaper versions of the test including one , @entity128 , which costs just £ 120 a time			0
but @entity10 said it needed to look at more evidence about the success of this test – invented by doctors at @entity134 ’s @entity133 – before recommending its use across the @entity4			1
it comes in the wake of the release earlier this week of a new jab which will revolutionise breast cancer treatment			0
@entity141 has given the go - ahead to the @entity144 injection being used			0
it takes just five minutes to administer and is estimated to save the @entity4 £ 20million a year .			0

@entity10 has approved the @entity14 test for use on the @entity4
it examines genes taken from the tumour to establish if it will spread
it could *prevent* thousands of women being over treated
doctors will use the test with other *information* , such as the size and grade of the tumour , to work out if chemotherapy could be beneficial
