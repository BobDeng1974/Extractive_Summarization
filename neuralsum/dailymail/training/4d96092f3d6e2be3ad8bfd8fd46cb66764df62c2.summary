@entity0 suffered a setback in the race for the top four after they lost to rivals @entity3 last weekend			1
fortunately for @entity4 , @entity0 are blessed with plenty of cash they could spend on reinforcements in the january transfer window			1
having already spent £ 150million last summer on mostly attacking talent , @entity0 's defence remains a cause for concern			1
here @entity14 looks at the targets they could sign			0
@entity16 ( @entity17 ) @entity16 ( left ) , pictured here battling @entity19 's @entity18 , has been facing @entity20 's best the 20 - year - old @entity21 is a great athlete but still raw			2
as with @entity22 , @entity17 will only consider a deal at buy - out clause level , which is understood to be £ 32m after a contract revision last june			2
that represents a big gamble for such a young player			0
however , @entity16 has impressed this season for @entity17 , making 3.9 interceptions per game - the second highest in @entity20			2
and former @entity17 manager @entity32 certainly rates @entity16 highly , tweeting : ' @entity16 is a great player , with lots of qualities			0
i ca n't remember a fault that i could tell you			0
' @entity38 ( @entity39 ) @entity40 celebrates scoring for @entity39 against @entity41 earlier in the season @entity39 need money to service growing debts and will listen to bids but would prefer to sell in the summer			1
@entity46 centre - back @entity38 is 30 and would cost £ 23m due to a reported release clause in his contract			1
team - mates @entity50 and @entity52 are younger and represent better value for @entity0			1
the emergence of 19 - year - old @entity52 this season has possibly convinced @entity39 that now is the right time to sell @entity38			1
convincing him to leave @entity19 may prove difficult , however			0
' staying at @entity58 was the best for me and my family			0
i ’m very happy to be at @entity58			0
i love @entity19 and this is a great club , ' he said when linked with a move away last summer			0
@entity64 ( @entity65 ) @entity64 signs autographs during @entity65 's training camp in @entity67 earlier this month @entity65 are in crisis , joint bottom of the @entity70 after 17 games , and selling their captain would be a disaster on and off the pitch			1
his father @entity75 says there is no deal to be done but some would argue @entity64 ' form has n't helped their plight and £ 35m is a lot to turn down			1
let 's not forget that @entity65 are a club accustomed to losing their best players annually and have seen the likes of @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 leave in consecutive seasons			1
asked about his future on monday , @entity64 was somewhat ambiguous			2
' i have always decided not to leave			0
i think i have made some good decisions and i want to make those in the future as well , ' @entity64 told @entity95			2
' i have never said i will stay until 2024 or 2030 or whenever			0
but i have stayed until today			0
i will stick to my way of not promising anything and maybe leave someday instead of saying i will stay forever and then leave all of a sudden			0
' @entity98 ( @entity99 ) @entity98 ( left ) battling @entity101 's @entity100 before crashing out of the @entity102 on tuesday @entity103 has insisted none of his players are for sale but offers above £ 25m would make @entity99 think			0
@entity0 want a right back but @entity108 also have a long - standing interest in @entity98 and would rival any offer			1
@entity98 would be comfortable at right back or wing back in @entity113 's preferred 3 - 5 - 2 formation and is a proven @entity115 performer who could instantly step in and improve @entity0 's creaking defence			1
@entity117 ( @entity118 ) @entity117 has struggled with injuries for @entity118 this season after an impressive @entity121 throw enough money at it and this is a deal that could be done this month			2
but @entity0 have shown no inclination so far to sign the 29 - year - old who is out of contract in the summer			1
the central defender has suffered a spate of injuries restricting him to just 12 appearances for @entity118 this season and is currently out for at least a month with a knee injury			0
this a concern for @entity0 who have suffered their own run of defensive injuries			2
@entity117 , however , was a part of @entity113 's @entity141 squad during the @entity121 and certainly impressed his manager			2
' he was the most important defender for @entity141 and he is always stable which is important			0
i was very happy with him , ' he said			0
@entity145 ( @entity146 ) @entity145 ( top ) celebrates scoring the winning goal for @entity146 against @entity19 earlier this month the 26 - year - old centre - back is a tough , warrior - type defender and @entity151 international who @entity0 watched while at @entity153 last season			1
@entity145 has been a mainstay of @entity146 ' defence this season , playing 18 times and scoring the winner against @entity19 earlier this month			1
he can also play right back - a bonus for @entity113 who likes his players to be tactically flexible			0
@entity145 also reportedly has a close relationship with international team - mate @entity163 which may help any potential move , though his £ 40m buyout clause could prove prohibitive .			1

@entity0 are still after new *recruits* to improve a shaky defence
@entity65 defender @entity64 remains a long - term target for the club
@entity4 interested in @entity38 , @entity145 and @entity117
