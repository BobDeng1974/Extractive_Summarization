while @entity4 has been hailed as the hero for @entity6 in the quarter - final penalty shoot - out his antics as @entity3 players approached to take their kicks went beyond gamesmanship			1
the @entity11 goalkeeper should have been told to stop his face - pulling and sledging by @entity14 referee @entity13 who had been excellent until that point			1
after standing by the assistant referee while his team are taking their kicks , as the law requires , he should have been made to go straight to the goal to face the next spot - kick			0
if he had carried on his antics he could have been sent off			0
however , because @entity13 failed even to warn @entity4 it is hard to blame the @entity34 too much for continuing to try to unsettle the @entity3 penalty - takers			2
there was debate as to whether it was fair for @entity6 coach @entity39 to make the late substitution which enabled him to put on the goalkeeper he thought best to face the spot - kicks			0
there is no issue within the laws of the game and , of course , he sacrificed the chance to bring on a fresh outfield player			0
@entity51 : @entity6 's players celebrate with @entity4 ( left ) after reaching the @entity54 semi-finals @entity55 : @entity39 congratulates @entity4 after he brought the goalkeeper on for shoot - out legal : @entity39 's ( left ) decision to bring on @entity4 ( centre ) was within the laws of the game @entity62 is penalty hero			1

@entity4 hailed as a hero in 4 - 3 shoot - out *win* in @entity54 quarter - final
@entity34 stopper should have been stopped from face - pulling and sledging
referee failed to even warn him when he should have cautioned keeper
no issue in laws of game with @entity39 substituting @entity4
