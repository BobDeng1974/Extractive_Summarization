residents living in a picturesque rural village with a population of just 613 have slammed plans to build a @entity5 cemetery on greenbelt land - for over 3,000 people			1
the proposed site in leafy @entity9 , near @entity10 , @entity11 , will include a total of 3,333 graves for followers of @entity15			1
this is despite @entity5 accounting for fewer than 3 per cent of the population of @entity10 and its surrounding areas			1
residents living in a picturesque rural village have hit out at controversial plans to build a @entity5 cemetery on rural land the proposed site of 3,000 graves ( edged in blue ) and the previous applications ( green and red ) that have been made for the sites near @entity10 , @entity11 previous applications to build what would have been @entity33 's largest @entity5 - only cemetery put before @entity34 have been unsuccessful			1
but @entity35 have now submitted scaled down plans with fewer graves , which could be approved next month			1
it would mean the cemetery could eventually hold over five times as many people as @entity9 itself			1
the graveyard would be able to comply fully with @entity45 law which states @entity5 are traditionally buried in their own section of land , next to others of the same faith			1
islamic law also stipulates a method of bathing and shrouding the bodies before being buried with their heads facing towards @entity56			0
yesterday villagers criticised the revised plans for the major development - which will also include 95 spaces for visitors - and said it would blight green belt land			2
locals are also objecting the plans for the cemetery based on concerns surrounding the impact it will have on traffic			1
@entity70 - of - four @entity71 , 55 , said : ' there is ample room for graves to accommodate the local population here			2
' i 'm a believer that these sort of developments should serve the local community , but we do n't have a massively large multicultural population here			0
' so plans to have a graveyard exclusively for @entity5 just seems a bit absurd to me			1
' leader of @entity86 , @entity87 councillor @entity87 , who represents the @entity90 ward , said he also agreed the needs of local people could already be met by current plots			0
the proposal in @entity9 , near @entity10 , @entity11 , would include a total of 3,333 graves for followers of @entity15 he said : ' this is simply not an appropriate place to site a cemetery			1
' planning permission was refused on substantial grounds last time and i will continue to oppose the scheme on the same grounds again			2
' there were a lot of environmental concerns with siting a cemetery on this land			2
this is just not the right position for this type of scheme			0
' there is no need for this extra site in @entity10			1
we have identified our population need and made provision for that			0
' obviously people are concerned about the scale of the development and its threat to greenbelt land around @entity9			1
' i do n't believe the case has been made to overcome the very special measures which apply to greenbelt land			2
' @entity132 , secretary of @entity133 , said the application was ' disappointing '			2
he added : ' at this stage we see no obvious difference in this application to the earlier plans or for planning to draw a different conclusion			1
residents in the surrounding are say it will have a great impact on traffic if given the green light ' the parking for 90 cars and access is much the same as is the impact on the openness of the green belt plus there was concern over pollution of watercourses			0
' conservative councillor @entity156 , who also represents @entity90 , added : ' my main concern is that they are building on the greenbelt land			0
' in @entity10 we do n't have a huge @entity5 population ' when the first application was taken down local people were delighted that it had gone away , but it 's come back with very little adjustment			1
' i understand people 's frustrations			0
' the cemetery has received backing from the @entity5 community in @entity10 , who said there was a desperate need for more burial spaces			1
the first application for planning permission for the cemetery was made in july 2014 and was for 4,000 burial plots , which was refused			1
this was increased to 7,000 on an adjacent site a month later , but this application was withdrawn			2
the latest application is for a total of 3,333 plots			0
according to a report by @entity35 , the site will be operated by a charity called @entity189 , which provides ' a low cost dignified burial at a freehold plot according to @entity15 beliefs and culture '			0
the report adds : ' after the departure of the soul , human being has been buried since beginning			0
' other methods of disposing of human remain are relatively new			0
being the oldest @entity202 , @entity5 have always maintained the ancient burial system			2
' to preserve this centuries old tradition in this part of the world we acquired a plot of land in the @entity9 area of @entity10 after consulting and obtaining positive response from @entity34			1
the cemetery has received backing from the @entity5 community in @entity10 , who said there was a desperate need for more burial spaces ' it is also an established fact that there is a shortage of burial places across the country			1
' @entity226 and @entity10 regions are not an exception			2
@entity189 is a positive endeavour in meeting the community burial need			0
' funeral director @entity230 , of @entity226 - based @entity231 , said even 3,000 burial plots would barely provide enough space for the next 50 years			0
he said : ' the local @entity5 population is growing rapidly			2
' do n't forget , the people who came here in the 1950s and 1960s are now old and dying fast			0
' before , they used to send people back home to their families in @entity241 and @entity242			0
' but apparently now all their families are here and they have no - one back home			0
' they are saying ' this is our country now			0
we are living here and dying here so we should be buried here			0
