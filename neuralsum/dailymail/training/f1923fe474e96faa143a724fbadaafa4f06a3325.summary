" ' i asked the manager and she said , " do n’t go there "			1
apparently it was the @entity30 or nothing - i was completely gobsmacked			0
' she said the policy was there because of fears the @entity11 ’s flag might offend people , which is just political correctness gone mad			1
' it annoys me because when it was @entity54 , they made a big deal out of it flying @entity58 flags , hats and shamrocks but yet we ca n’t celebrate our national day			2

she said : ' i can see her point , but we have always used the @entity30 to celebrate @entity34 and it has never been an issue before			2
' she started questioning it and she also said we should make a bigger deal out of @entity34 than @entity54 ’s , which i agree with			0
' but i ’ve been at @entity3 for eight years and nothing has changed in that time			0
' a @entity3 spokeswoman denied the @entity30 flags were put up through fear of offending customers with the @entity6 national flag			1
