by @entity0 a couple separated a little boy from his six brothers and sisters because they felt that he ' did not fit into the family ' , a high court judge has heard			1
they decided to live as a ' divided family ' with the mother and six children occupying one room and the father and little boy occupying another , mrs justice @entity7 was told			1
the little boy , now five , was ' largely confined ' to a room with a gate placed across the doorway			1
@entity21 said the local authority with responsibility for the children was @entity25 ( pictured ) he shared his father ’s meals			1
mrs @entity28 said the little boy must have suffered ' significant emotional harm '			1
she said the depth of that harm might not become apparent until he was older			2
detail of the little boy ’s treatment has emerged in a written ruling by the judge following a hearing in a family court in @entity41			2
she wrote : ' he was seen as the problem and he and the other children must have known it ; indeed the older children have said so			0
mrs @entity28 did not identify the couple but said they had lived in the @entity50 towns of @entity51 and @entity52 ( pictured ) ' the emotional harm that this has caused his siblings is significant			1
the oldest three have expressed guilt and remorse at the way he was treated ; they should not have been put in that position			0
' the judge ruled that all seven children - aged between 13 and three - should be taken into care			2
in her judgement she wrote : ' the plan of the local authority is not to place the children with permanent adoptive families ; this is entirely appropriate given their ages and their close relationships as a sibling group and the need for them to continue to have regular contact with each other			0
' the local authority must ensure that they are put in long - term placements where they can develop long - term and secure relationships so as to minimise the disadvantages that are inherent in the care system			0
' the children must have regular , frequent and good quality contact which means that proper arrangements must be put in place			0
' she said all had probably suffered ' significant and long - lasting harm ' as a result of their parents ’ care			2
mrs @entity28 did not identify the couple but said they had lived in the @entity50 towns of @entity51 and @entity52			0
and the judge said the local authority with responsibility for the children was @entity25 .			0
