a @entity1 space explorer took off today on a six - year journey to complete the most ambitious mission to an asteroid ever attempted			0
the explorer , named @entity6 , is heading for the carbon - rich asteroid 1999 @entity9 , which could hold secrets to how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago			1
the probe is expected travel 185 million miles ( 300 million km ) to reach the asteroid in mid- 2018 , spend 18 months studying it and return in late 2020 with samples in time for the @entity16			1
the explorer , named @entity6 , is heading for the carbon - rich asteroid 1999 @entity9 , which could hold secrets to how the solar system formed the 1,300lbs ( 600 kg ) spacecraft was launched on a hydrogen - fueled @entity27 rocket at the seaside spaceport of @entity29 in southern @entity1			1
the rocket 's upper stage engine fired twice to help the daring spacecraft break free from the pull of @entity35 's gravity			2
carrying four stowaway landers , the spacecraft separated from the @entity27 rocket at 06:09 gmt ( 1:09am est )			0
once it reaches the asteroid , a small device will separate from the explorer and shoot a projectile to blast open a crater several feet in diameter			0
@entity1 's next asteroid sample return mission will take six years to return material from 1999 @entity9 back to @entity35			1
this will involve a number of stages , including dropping an ' impactor ' that will explode above the asteroid 's surface to allow a probe to collect material the probe is expected ) to reach the asteroid in mid- 2018 , spend 18 months studying it and return in late 2020 with samples in time for the @entity16			1

it will blast a crater in the asteroid to collect virgin materials unexposed to millennia of solar wind and radiation			2
it aims to answer some fundamental questions about life and the universe - including how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago			0
@entity6 , about the size of a refrigerator , is expected to reach the asteroid in 2018 and will spend around 18 months studying the surface			1
it will also drop tiny @entity90 rover robots as well as a @entity93 - @entity92 landing package named @entity94 ( @entity95 ) for surface observation			0
in a galactic first , @entity6 will drop an ' impactor ' that will explode above the asteroid 's surface and fire a metal bullet into the crust at a speed of 4,5000 miles ( 7,200 l , ) -- six times the speed of sound on @entity35			1
the bullet is expected to create a small crater that will enable the probe to collect material that will be returned to @entity35 in 2020			1
the probe will map the surface of the asteroid before touching down , deploying small explosives to blast a crater to collect virgin materials unexposed to millennia of solar wind and radiation			1

@entity6 , which means peregrine falcon in @entity1 , plans to hide behind the asteroid during the blast to protect its vital systems			2
the probe is a rectangular unit with two sets of solar panels sticking out from its sides			0
the main unit measures 3.3 x 5.2 x 4.6 ft ( 1 x 1.6 x 1.4 metres )			0
' the asteroid is carbonaceous and we may find organic matter and water , the stuff of life , ' said @entity140 , project leader at the @entity141			0
' the impactor is made fully with @entity1 technologies that are so advanced you would think they are out of this world , ' he added it will also drop tiny @entity90 rover robots as well as a @entity93 - @entity92 landing package named @entity94 ( @entity95 ) for surface observation			2
the mission should help @entity1 's space programme put a troubled past well behind it			0
the first @entity6 probe was unable to collect as much material as hoped but still made history by being the first vessel to bring back samples from an asteroid			1
its seven - year mission ended in 2010 when it blazed a trail over @entity163 before slamming into the desert			0
but at the time , @entity141 's work guiding the craft back to @entity35 made it a source of pride for @entity1 , even inspiring several @entity1 feature films			0
by reaching inside an asteroid this time , the new explorer may recover material that is not as weathered by the space environment and heat			0
' the mission was completed one way or another , but we stumbled along the way , ' said @entity180 from @entity141 's lunar and planetary exploration team			0
the mission aims to answer some fundamental questions about life and the universe - including how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago			0
the above graphic was created by @entity189 and provided by @entity190 the ambitious spacecraft separated from the @entity27 rocket at 06:09 gmt ( 1:09am est )			0
it is seen here leaving @entity35 above the @entity194 the probe is a rectangular unit with two sets of solar panels sticking out from its sides			2
it measures 3.3 x 5.2 x 4.6 ft ( 1 x 1.6 x 1.4 metres ) the probe will map the surface of the asteroid before touching down , deploying small explosives to blast a crater to collect virgin materials ' to travel there and bring back something is extremely difficult			2
' asteroids are believed to have formed at the dawn of the solar system and the probe 's target is one called 1999 @entity9 , which scientists believe contains organic matter that may have contributed to life on @entity35			2
@entity218 , a rocky body around 3,000ft ( 900 metres ) across with a tenuous gravity field , with a gravity field 60,000 times weaker than @entity35 's			2
it is believed to contain significantly more organic matter and water than the potato - shaped rock studied by the original @entity6			0
its launch , postponed twice because of bad weather , comes less than a month after a @entity231 probe landed on a comet in a pioneering mission			1
the @entity231 's @entity235 probe finished a 57 - hour mission on the surface of a comet on 15 november			1
but the solar - powered probe lost battery power due to landing in a spot shielded			0
the @entity243 mission team hope to revive it in march as it nears the sun. @entity6 , about the size of a refrigerator , is expected to reach the asteroid in 2018 and will spend around 18 months studying the surface			1
pictured on the left is an artist 's impression of the probe above @entity35 , while the right image shows @entity6 attached to rocket before launch the @entity141 ( @entity141 ) unveiled the darying @entity6 - 2 , an unmanned asteroid explorer , in december 2012 the 1,300lb ( 600 kg ) spacecraft was launched today at the seaside spaceport of @entity29 in southern @entity1			1

*hayabusa* 2 is heading for asteroid 1999 @entity218 , which is currently 185 million miles ( 300 million km ) from @entity35
@entity264 will reach the asteroid in mid- 2018 , spend 18 months studying it and return to @entity35 in 2020 with samples
@entity6 plans to drop an ' impactor ' that will explode above asteroid 's surface and fire a bullet into the crust
this will allow it to collect material from *beneath* surface that has been *untouched* by solar winds and radiation
its launch , postponed twice due to bad weather , comes less than a month the @entity235 probe landed on a comet
