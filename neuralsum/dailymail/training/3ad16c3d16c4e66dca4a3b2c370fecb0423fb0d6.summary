in his explosive new tell - all , the @entity9 woman ’s lawyer @entity7 accuses @entity11 of abusing his daughter , and speculates that @entity11 could have murdered 2 - year - old @entity1 to hide evidence of abuse			1
@entity15 was sensationally acquitted of murdering her daughter after a highly - publicised trial last july.in his book , @entity18 , @entity1 : the @entity20 , @entity7 reveals aspects of the @entity11 ’s private lives that were not looked into during the trial			1
accused : @entity1 's lawyer accused her father @entity11 , left , of sexually assaulting her , and speculates that he killed @entity15 's daughter @entity1 to cover up the abuse troubled past : @entity1 , centre , pictured july 7th , 2011 , says she was frequently molested by her father and told her lawyer that she feared he was @entity1 's father the lawyer accused @entity11 of killing the toddler to hide evidence of abuse			1
@entity7 first made the shocking allegation at the trial ’s opening statements , saying that @entity11 killed @entity1 , disposed of the girl ’s remains , and then lied about it to authorities			1
@entity15 confided in @entity7 that she was worried her father might have fathered @entity1 , because he had sex with her around the time she had become pregnant			1
dna tests later revealed that @entity11 was not the father			2
@entity11 , through a family attorney , denied ever abusing @entity15			1
however , @entity15 and her father have reportedly been estranged since october 14 , 2008 , the day , @entity48 notes , that he testified against her , leading to the grand jury indicting her for @entity51 testified in the trial : ‘ i would have done anything i could to save my granddaughter			1
’ @entity1 's defense attorney : @entity7 gestures as he speaks about his just - published book @entity18 , @entity1 : the @entity20 almost a year to the day she was acquitted one year on : @entity15 was sensationally acquitted by a jury last july 5 , left , and walked free from jail just over a week later , right someone in the @entity11 house conducted several suicide - related searches on the family computer , including ‘ fool - proof suffocation ’ and ‘ venturing into the pro-suicide pit ’ on the day little @entity1 vanished , @entity1 ’s defence attorney @entity7 said			1
the attorney revealed that the searches were conducted around an hour after @entity15 ’s father @entity11 said she left the home			1
while last year ’s trial famously revealed that the family computer also had searches for ‘ chloroform , ’ the suicide searches were not revealed , @entity7 said , because they were discovered after the fact			2
he told @entity75 : ‘ i have a hard time believing that law enforcement would n’t check the internet history of the day that the child went missing			0
that would have been bombshell evidence in the trial if it had come out			0
’ @entity7 , @entity1 's defense lawyer , has written a tell - all book about the case prosecutors claimed @entity11 suffocated @entity1 with duct tape so she could spend time with her boyfriend and be free for @entity90 's nightlife			1
@entity7 said during the trial - repeated again in his book - that @entity1 accidentally drowned in a family swimming pool and that her father , @entity11 , hid the body			1
@entity7 also claimed @entity11 sexually abused his daughter			1
@entity11 denied both allegations , and there was little brought up about them during the trial			2
@entity7 said the defence was n't required to put on any such evidence because proving the case is the prosecution 's burden , not the other way around			2
@entity11 tried to commit suicide in january 2009 , and was found in a @entity109 hotel after overdosing on prescription drugs			2
a five - page suicide note was also discovered at the hotel			0
@entity7 told @entity75 that it was hard to determine who in the @entity113 conducted what searches on january 16 , 2008 , but said it was possible to infer who searched what , based on the terms searched			0
for instance , one of the terms searched was ‘ foolproof suffocation			0
’ @entity7 noted that the terms were spelled incorrectly , and that @entity11 struggled with good spelling			1
he wrote in his book : ‘ by looking at the websites being researched , all concerned with suicide and death , it certainly appears that the one who felt the blame was a guilt - ridden @entity11			1
’ in his book , @entity7 also lashes out at several entities - calling the media a ' monster ' , the police ' careless ' and the prosecution ' scheming and ruthless '			2
he wrote : ' this was not real life , it was the media 's @entity1 reality show , a show that depended on name - calling and controversy for television ratings			2
' evidence and testimony showed that @entity15 was a habitual liar , even making up fake friends and pretending every day to go to a job she did n't have at @entity152			0
@entity7 was asked whether @entity11 's lies surrounding her daughter 's disappearance might be indicative that she was guilty			1
counsel : defence attorney @entity7 talks to @entity1 during her trial when the jury heard her father say her car smelled of human decomposition			1
@entity7 revealed in his book he also thought he could smell a dead body innocent : mystery surrounds the cause of @entity1 's death after her mother was acquitted of her murder one year ago today ' i do n't think the lies are indicative of innocence or guilt , ' he said			1
' the lies were there long before @entity1 passed away			0
' in the book , he says @entity11 had built a ' fantasy world , ' and her lies were n't evidence of guilt but signs of someone with ' serious mental health issues			0
' @entity7 said one piece of prosecution evidence he was most concerned about was that police cadaver dogs had indicated a body may have been in the trunk of @entity11 's car at one point and also that a body may have been in the backyard			1
none was discovered in the backyard and there was nothing but rotting bags of trash in the trunk			0
but , he said , people - and jurors - believe in dogs			0
' that concerned me a little bit			0
most people really think dogs can do magic , ' @entity7 said			0
he also strongly considered early in the case whether she should plead guilty to a lesser charge to avoid the death penalty if convicted of murdering her two - year - old daughter @entity1 , but @entity11 adamantly insisted she had nothing to do with the toddler 's death			1
new look : the last time the public saw @entity15 was when this video was released in october			0
she is said to be living in @entity223 , @entity9 ' found ' : @entity224 , @entity9 , where @entity1 is reported to be staying with a friend @entity7 said prosecutors offered in 2008 to allow @entity11 to plead guilty to aggravated manslaughter of a child and serve up to 13 years in prison			1
he said that in those early days he thought taking it might be in @entity11 's best interest			0
' there were times , difficult times , when the evidence did n't look good for @entity15 , ' @entity7 said , adding that it was his obligation as a lawyer to convey any such plea offers			2
the prosecution 's flaw , he added , was that regarding the car search the dog and handler were focused only on @entity11 's vehicle and did not include others in a lineup to give the dog options			0
overall , @entity7 attributed the strong public backlash against the jury 's verdict to a lack of understanding about the judicial system and because ' a lot of people bought into the hype ' that @entity11 must have been guilty			1
he noted that jurors who gave media interviews after the trial said they waited for weeks for strong evidence that never came			0
' we need to talk about whether an actual murder occurred , ' he said			0
' that 's where the focus should have been , and it never was			0
' @entity7 declined to comment on what @entity11 is doing these days and on how often he talks to her			2
he said he promised her confidentiality when she agreed that he could write his book , in which she did not participate			0
@entity11 is living in an undisclosed location in @entity9 serving probation for an unrelated conviction , which @entity7 said ends on august 21			2
parents : @entity11 and @entity1 both lied to cover up what really happened to @entity1 , claims @entity7 ' she 's doing a lot better than she was in prison , ' @entity7 said , but then added : ' she 's a prisoner of her own freedom			1
' @entity11 , he said , ' would not entertain it for a second '			0
as he became more familiar with the state 's mostly circumstantial case , @entity7 said he grew convinced she would be acquitted by a jury – as she was a year ago today of all charges except for four misdemeanors of lying to investigators			1
' there was nothing in the trial that ever made me think @entity15 was guilty of anything as related to the murder , ' @entity7 said			2
' every single piece of evidence favored us			0
' he told @entity301 ' @entity300 : ' i think @entity1 's story , the whole case , was a media phenomenon			0
and i say that because she was young , pretty and white			0
' if it did n't have those elements to it i do n't think it would have taken off			0
' prosecutors claimed @entity11 suffocated @entity1 with duct tape so she could spend time with her boyfriend and be free for @entity90 's nightlife .			2
