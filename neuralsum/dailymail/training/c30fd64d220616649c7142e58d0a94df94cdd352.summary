by @entity0 a new study has shown a link between @entity4 usage and the number of relationships plagued by social media - related fights			1
more than 500 active @entity4 users were surveyed and the results showed that the more time an individual spent on the social networking site , the more problems ensued in their relationships			1
' although a number of variables can contribute to relationship infidelity and separation , social networking site usage , such as @entity4 and @entity22 use , can be damaging to relationships , ' the report 's author @entity14 said			2
watching over : a new study showed a connection between the amount that someone is active on @entity4 and the likelihood that they will have a social networking - related conflict in their romantic offline relationships findings : @entity14 , pictured , is a doctoral student at the @entity34 and previously examined the detrimental effects of @entity22 mr @entity14 , a doctoral student at the @entity36 , previously studied the effect that @entity22 had on relationships and now his examination into @entity4 proves that the newer micro-blogging platform is creating a similar level of jealousy that he found for @entity22			1
' @entity22 - induced jealousy , partner surveillance , posting ambiguous information , compulsive internet use , and online portrayal of intimate relationships can be damaging to romantic relationships , ' he wrote in the study , released sunday			0
' since @entity4 now allows users to interact in a similar way as @entity22 ( i.e. , write posts and upload images , videos , and location check - ins ) , the researcher theorizes that the effects of @entity4 use on interpersonal relationships are comparable to those associated with @entity22			2
' for @entity22 , he found that if partners stayed ' friends ' on the social network , that would delay the healing process because they would go back and look through their ex 's activity and photos			0
in the new study , called ‘ @entity69 ’ , mr @entity14 went on to extrapolate that , as a result of the interview with 581 @entity4 users , reports of @entity4 - related conflict within couples ' significantly predicted ' negative outcomes that included cheating and break ups			2
' i found it interesting that active @entity4 users experienced @entity4 - related conflict and negative relationship outcomes regardless of length of romantic relationship , ' @entity14 said			1
perils of @entity4 : though no specific numbers were released of the exact number of divorces were caused by excessive @entity4 use , some high profile cases like that of @entity89 and @entity90 make the likelihood of @entity4 - related conflicts in marriages seem very likely ' couples who reported being in relatively new relationships experienced the same amount of conflict as those in longer relationships			0
' one solution that they suggest is to limit the individual 's time on @entity4 if they begin to notice the outbreak of @entity4 - related disagreements			0
another option is to take the secrecy out of the equation by having joint accounts that both partners use and have easy access to .			0

a @entity36 study shows that @entity4 usage can lead *people* to cheat and cause problems in relationships offline
