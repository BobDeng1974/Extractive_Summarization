breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic ' markers ' breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic ' markers ' in the tumour and determine its aggressiveness			1
after surgery , the cancer cells are sent to a lab where they are screened , and women can be told within days whether they have a high or low risk of the disease returning			1
for some women , the test can accurately tell if the risk is as low as five per cent , which is as good as if not better than the odds for those who have chemotherapy			2
the majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence			1
although the medication kills off cancer cells , the side effects – including complete hair loss , nausea , sickness , weight gain or loss , and extreme fatigue – can be difficult to live with			0
for some women , the prospect of chemotherapy is more daunting than the surgery itself			0
but experts have long - believed that the risk of cancer recurrence for certain women is a lot less than for others , and that for some , chemotherapy may not be necessary			1
if the newest of the tests , called @entity52 , shows a low score , patients can opt not to have chemotherapy			2
most of the tests are available only privately and cost about £ 2,500 , although breast specialists hope they may soon become properly available on the @entity58			1
@entity59 said : ' i think there is a good case for the @entity58 to use this test on the basis that the cost is balanced out by savings in not giving chemotherapy			2

i was worried it would interfere with me being able to look after my children			0
' professor @entity68 operated on @entity77 in december at the @entity93 , @entity70 , and afterwards a sample of her tumour was sent away and tested using the @entity52			0
a low score meant her chances of recurrence within ten years were just five per cent and she was told chemotherapy could not offer much better odds			0
' i could have gone through chemo and the cancer could still return , ' she says			0
' there is no treatment that places your chances at zero			0
but if you have regular monitoring , there is every chance that any cancer that might come back would be nipped in the bud early			0
