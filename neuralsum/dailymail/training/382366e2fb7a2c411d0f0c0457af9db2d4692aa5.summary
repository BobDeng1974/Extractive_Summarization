at the @entity2 opening ceremony on thursday , a paraplegic will leave behind their wheelchair to take to the pitch in this robotic suit the most impressive kick of the @entity2 wo n't come from a known football star			1
instead , it will be from a paraplegic teenager who will use a robotic bodysuit to kick a ball using his or her mind			1
for the past few months , @entity16 doctor @entity15 has been putting the final touches to the futuristic exoskeleton , which was designed to enable paralysis victims to walk			2
at the @entity2 opening ceremony on thursday in @entity22 , a paraplegic - whose identity has been kept secret - will leave behind their wheelchair to take to the pitch in the suit			1
the exoskeleton , which has been designed as part of the international ' @entity28 ' , will use motorised metal braces to support and bend the teenager ’s legs			1
the suit itself will be controlled by patterns of brain activity detected by electrodes placed either on the scalp or in the brain itself			1
these signals will be sent wirelessly to a computer worn by the wearer , converting them into movements			1
the team have incorporated sensors into the exoskeleton that feed information about touch , temperature and force back to the wearer			2
the feedback is expected to come through a visual display or a vibrating motor			2
‘ it 's the first time an exoskeleton has been controlled by brain activity and offered feedback to the patients , ’ dr @entity15 , a neuroscientist at @entity55 , told @entity56 down for video the exoskeleton , which has been designed as part of the international ' @entity28 ' , will use motorised metal braces to support and bend the teenager 's legs			1

the teenager had undergone training in a virtual reality simulator to translate thoughts into signals to the robotic armour			1
‘ doing a demonstration in a stadium is something very much outside our routine in robotics			0
it 's never been done before			0
’ dr @entity15 said his team have barely left the lab since march , when they arrived in @entity22 , @entity16 's largest city and economic hub , to make the final preparations			1
but it 's been rewarding , too , he said , recalling the moment on 24 april when a paralysed user first took steps in the exoskeleton			2
dr @entity15 ’ voice contains a mix of exhaustion and excitement , the result of 30 years ' work , more than 200 scientific papers and countless clinical tests that are nearing a spectacular summit			0
the scientist started down this path in 1984 when he wrote his doctoral thesis on neural connections in muscular control			0
he said the idea for the suit came to him in 2002 , when scientists were just beginning to explore robotic exoskeletons			0
the team have named the device the @entity143 , a combination of the three - letter sporting code for @entity16 and @entity146 , a @entity16 inventor who once demonstrated controllable flight was possible by flying his dirigible around the @entity149			0
video : @entity15 at @entity151 scientists from around the world are working to enable a young @entity16 paraplegic to kick off the opening game of the @entity156 2014			0
the teenager will wear an exoskeleton , artists ' illustration pictured , that will be controlled by patterns of brain activity detected some scientists have criticised dr @entity15 for ditching academic publications in favour of mass media - he posts research updates on @entity169 - and the anonymity of the lab for the lights of the @entity2 stage			1
critics have also questioned the practicality of his research and accused him of hogging an unfair share of the @entity16 government 's research budget			0
dr @entity15 rejects that criticism			0
‘ the funding is the same with or without the @entity2 , ’ he said			0
‘ we 've received $ 14 million ( £ 8.4 million ) from the @entity16 government over the last two years			0
‘ that 's approximately four or five times less than what the @entity186 government invests in a mechanical arm			0
’ ‘ i do n't see anything wrong with demonstrating a technology for the whole world that has a humanitarian objective and was paid for by civil society , ’ he added			0
more than 65,000 people will be in @entity22 's @entity196 to watch the @entity199 - @entity198 's first steps in public before @entity16 play @entity201 in the opening match			2
around a billion are expected to watch on tv			0

motorised metal braces will be used to support and bend teenager ’s legs
suit will be controlled by patterns of brain activity detected by electrodes
the signals will be sent to a computer converting them into movements
*unnamed* teenager will then be able to kick a ball on pitch in @entity22
this is the first time an exoskeleton has been controlled by brain activity and offered feedback to the patient
