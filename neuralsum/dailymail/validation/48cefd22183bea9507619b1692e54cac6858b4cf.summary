a skydiver narrowly avoided death after a double parachute malfunction resulted in him plunging to the ground at around 25mph			0
the footage captured on the skydiver ’s head camera begins with a trio jumping from a plane over @entity9 , @entity10			2
initially the jump appears to be a success as the skydiver picks up images of the plane , his fellow skydivers dressed in wingsuits and the @entity10 landscape on his camera			0
so far so good : the skydiver captures his fellow jumpers on their descent over @entity9 , @entity10 but suddenly , the bridle , which connects the pilot chute – a small auxiliary parachute used to deploy the main parachute – to the deployment bag containing the parachute , wraps around the pilot chute			1
it then appears that the reserve parachute , which is automatically deployed via an @entity29 ( reserve static line ) system after cutting away from the main parachute , becomes tangled			0
this sends the skydiver spiralling out of control , and he begins a dizzying descent back down to earth from a height of more than 1000ft			1
the skydiver 's reserve parachute , which is automatically deployed via an rsl system after cutting away from the main parachute , becomes tangled the skydiver is sent spiralling out of control and back down to earth at a height of more than 1000ft as he finally reaches the ground it appears that he is descending relatively slowly considering he is without a fully working parachute			1
but as he slams into the earth with a crunch he groans in pain and shock before attempting to rise to his feet			0
the man was later taken to the hospital where , remarkably , he was only treated for mild concussion and bruising			2
writing online after the incident , the skydiver said that he was very lucky to be alive and that some of the people who witnessed the fall expected it to be fatal			0
