the @entity0 last night backed military action in @entity2 to stop the bloody persecution of thousands of @entity4 by @entity6 fanatics			1
in a dramatic intervention , @entity7 said military force could be justified against the murderous extremists of @entity11 in order to counter their ‘ unjust aggression ’			1

but the @entity0 last night went much further , giving conditional backing to the use of military force to halt the march of @entity11			0
speaking to journalists while returning from a trip to @entity40 , @entity7 indicated he would prefer military action to be backed by the @entity42			1
asked if he approved of the unilateral @entity47 action on militants he said : ‘ in these cases , where there is an unjust aggression , i can only say that it is licit to stop the unjust aggressor			2
‘ i underscore the verb “ stop ”			0
i ’m not saying “ bomb ” or “ make war ” , just stop			0
and the means that can be used to stop them must be evaluated			0
’ he has also claimed he could take a trip to northern @entity2 himself to show solidarity with persecuted @entity4 a @entity62 fighter pictured in battle with @entity11 forces 20km east of @entity65 , @entity2 @entity67 forces driving near the town of @entity69 , south of @entity70 , the capital of @entity71 the @entity0 also said he and his advisers were considering whether he might go to northern @entity2 himself to show solidarity with persecuted @entity4			1
his comments represent a remarkable about - turn for the @entity76 , which has vehemently opposed any military intervention in recent years			0
only last year pope @entity7 staged a global prayer and fast for peace when the @entity30 was threatening air strikes against @entity81			1

‘ for the next few days i shall not be terribly far away , so if that ’s necessary you will find me at my desk			0
’ @entity87 has been criticised for going on holiday while the atrocities and humanitarian crisis in @entity2 intensifies @entity87 and his wife @entity119 at a market on the southwestern coast of @entity122 earlier this month but @entity124 mp @entity123 , @entity94 ’s former special envoy to @entity2 , said it was extraordinary that mr @entity87 was pressing ahead with his holiday at a time of crisis			1
she told the @entity129 : ‘ the prime minister should not be going on holiday at such a volatile time			0
he ’s been sounding off , saying @entity11 is a threat to the @entity30			0
he is right to do that but it just not acceptable to then push off on holiday			0
’ miss @entity123 said @entity135 should be recalled to debate the crisis			2
she said she would back some form of military intervention , including the rescue of an estimated 3,000 women and girls of the @entity143 sect captured by fanatics			0
some @entity146 mps also added to pressure for a recall of @entity135			0
@entity149 said : ‘ @entity135 should be recalled ... so @entity145 can debate what is going on in @entity2 , and we are very naive if we think that what is unfolding on the streets of @entity2 has nothing to do with us			1
’ earlier , mr @entity87 insisted the government has a ‘ fully worked through ’ strategy to deal with the threat of @entity11 , including police action to tackle supporters in this country			1
he said @entity94 was ‘ not going to get involved in another war in @entity2 ’			1
‘ we are not going to be putting boots on the ground , ’ he said			0
‘ yes , we should use all the assets that we have – our diplomacy , our political relationships , our aid , the military prowess , the expertise that we have to help others ... to put pressure on @entity11 and make sure ... it can not cause mayhem on our own streets			1
’ number 10 said a recall of @entity135 was ‘ not on the cards ’ unless the situation changes			2
discussions are currently taking place with authorities in @entity71 about what military equipment @entity94 could provide .			2
