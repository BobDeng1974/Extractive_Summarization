i put on my helmet , i go and mine turds , hopefully i do n't get turd lung disease			2
' asked if he 'd ever voluntarily watch @entity21 , @entity2 said , ' let 's say that it 's a nuclear winter , and i have been wandering , and there appears to be a flickering light through what appears to be a radioactive cloud and i think that light might be a food source that could help my family			2
' i might glance at it for a moment until i realize , that 's @entity21 , and then i shut it off			0
' @entity2 also confessed that his ' moments of dissatisfaction ' with the show had started to become more frequent			1

it was more , " yup , it 's working			0
but i 'm not getting the same satisfaction , ' " he said			0
' these things are cyclical			0
you have moments of dissatisfaction , and then you come out of it and it 's ok			2
