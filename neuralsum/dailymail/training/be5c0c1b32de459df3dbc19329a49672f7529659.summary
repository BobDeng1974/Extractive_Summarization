@entity0 demanded an official timekeeper at @entity3 matches after @entity5 's controversial equaliser for @entity6 was scored after injury - time had elapsed at @entity8			1
with @entity10 leading 2 - 1 , fourth official @entity9 had signalled five minutes added time before @entity11 bundled over @entity5 inside the penalty area			1
@entity5 's spot kick , initially saved by @entity10 keeper @entity14 , was saved after 95 minutes and 54 seconds , but the @entity6 forward followed up to score the equaliser			1
the referee awards a penalty to @entity6 has @entity5 goes down under a challenge from @entity11 @entity5 appeals for a late penalty at @entity8 as he is challenged from behind by @entity11 in injury time @entity21 reacts to @entity5 's fall in the penalty box as the referee points to the spot with seconds left @entity6 players celebrate the chance to go level at home to @entity10 with an injury time penalty song is left with his head in his hands as @entity6 are awarded a penalty following his challenge on @entity5 the late equaliser for @entity6 came when @entity11 needlessly fouled @entity5 and his reaction to @entity41 â€™s decision told you it was accurate			1
given the time that elapsed , @entity41 probably allowed a little more time for the penalty to be taken which the laws of the game stipulate and he should be pleased with his performance which contributed to an entertaining game			1
@entity0 claimed referee @entity41 would not be ' brave enough ' to blow the whistle for full - time after @entity14 had saved @entity5 's kick			1
the @entity10 manager said : ' i 'd like a timekeeper to be perfectly honest with you			1
so we 're now doing @entity60 are n't we ? ' he would n't be brave enough to blow at home , would he ? he 'll say there was still two seconds left , or he will say that when the penalty was taken there were five seconds left			1
' @entity41 blew his whistle for full - time the very moment @entity10 kicked off and they were unlucky not to win at @entity8 for the third successive game			1
@entity10 goalkeeper @entity14 gets down well to save @entity5 's penalty before he taps home the rebound @entity14 guesses the right way ad saves @entity5 's penalty before the number 18 taps home the equaliser @entity5 reels away in celebration having given @entity6 a late equaliser at home to rivals @entity10 ' at the end , the referee 's not the reason why we drew			1
more than ourselves and a huge slice of luck for @entity6			0
i thought it was more good fortune today for @entity6			0
' the first goal was a complete miss - hit			2
when it bounces over the goalkeeper after it 's hit the floor , it 's so unusual that it sneaks into the corner and it lifts the opposition			0
' @entity0 also admitted he had some sympathy with @entity97 manager @entity96 over the inconsistency of refereeing decisions after they were denied two penalties against @entity101			1
he added : ' @entity102 goes down after a blatant push from the full - back and it 's not a penalty			2
so that is the inconsistency that we unfortunately have to deal with			0
@entity109 and @entity110 are left dejected as @entity5 celebrates his injury time equaliser ' here you can see why the referee 's give it because @entity11 's put his hands on him but the thing is that will happen next week and you wo n't see a penalty , as we saw in the @entity97 game			1
' @entity5 was n't going to go anywhere because @entity21 was in a covering position and @entity5 's first touch was too heavy , and he knew it were too heavy			2
' you 've got to give him credit for getting @entity6 a point in the end			0
it was also lucky because he missed the penalty and luckily it went to him to finish off			2
' @entity6 chief @entity131 admitted it was a big point for his side as they enter a crucial week in the @entity135 and play the @entity137 final against @entity97 at @entity138			0
@entity5 celebrates his late equalising goal against @entity10 at @entity8 on sunday afternoon he said : ' we are always confident because we trust our players and we never give up			1
this is important , we showed big character and big personality			0
' in the last 20 minutes it was important for us , it was a big point			0
it was difficult to play , but it is good to show character			0
for that we are proud			0
' at half - time i tried to change , but after the day was n't good for us			2
the second goal , now i have seen on tv , was offside			0
but it 's true that at 2 - 0 down , for me it 's important to say that we showed character and personality that was important for the team			0
' i do n't know if it was a penalty , maybe the tv can explain better			0
from my vision , maybe			0
it is difficult to say yes or no. ' opposing managers @entity0 and @entity166 direct their players match at @entity8			2

@entity5 went down under a challenge from @entity11 in injury time
@entity5 missed the penalty but was on hand to tap home an equaliser
@entity0 feels the *striker* went down too easily to earn a penalty
@entity10 took a two goal lead via @entity181 and @entity182
