i could n't understand what was happening to me and i kept thinking that it would go away soon			0

support : mr @entity8 with his fiance @entity149			2
he said : ' going out at night is not an easy task either as we have to plan in advance and have taxi pick us up then leave early , to avoid not standing in a taxi queue at night ' ' i have to wear ridiculous amounts of clothes in the winter and it 's tough covering transport costs , clothing costs and fuel bills			2
' although the condition has had a massive impact on his life and those closest to him , @entity8 says he has amazing support from his family including his fiancé @entity149 who he hopes to marry next year			1
' my fiancé has been great			0
she adapted really well to my condition and gives me support every day			0
' at first things were tough and they still are as we can no longer do outdoor things like going for a walk			0

' cold urticaria is an allergy to cold temperatures , where exposure causes redness , itching , swelling and hives on the skin			1
as much as possible , people with cold urticaria should avoid exposure to cold air and cold water			1
swimming in cold water , for example , is the most common cause of a severe , whole - body reaction - leading to fainting , shock and even death , according to the @entity202			1
the majority of cold urticaria reactions occur when skin is exposed to temperatures lower than @entity207 ) , but some people can have reactions to warmer temperatures			1
damp and windy conditions may make cold urticaria more likely			1
symptoms include : @entity214 , itchy hives ( wheals ) on the area of skin that was exposed to cold , swelling of hands when holding cold objects , swelling of lips when eating cold foods			2
what causes the condition is n't clear , but some people appear to have overly sensitive skin cells , either due to an inherited trait or caused by a virus or other illness			2
in some cases , cold urticaria goes away on its own after several months			1
in other cases , it lasts many years			0
