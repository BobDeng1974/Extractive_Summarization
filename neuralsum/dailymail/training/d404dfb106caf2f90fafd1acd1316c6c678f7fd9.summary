her son @entity27 and daughter @entity26 receive a third each			0
the remaining third was left equally to grandchildren @entity0 , 24 , and @entity30 , 19 , once they reach the age of 25			0
the bequest to mrs @entity4 was included in an amendment @entity8 made to her will in 2003			1
the same amendment said that @entity30 - who impressed mourners with a flawless reading during @entity8 ’s funeral service at @entity39 - should also receive ‘ free of inheritance tax ’ her grandmother ’s ‘ tiger brooch with sapphire ’			1
last night mrs @entity4 , who began working for @entity8 in 1978 and still saw her regularly in her final years , spoke of her ‘ pride ’ at being given her long - time friend and employer ’s ‘ beautiful ’ basket - shaped , floral brooch			1
speaking from her home overlooking the @entity49 around @entity50 , she said : ‘ it is very kind and thoughtful of her and it will be treasured forever			0
