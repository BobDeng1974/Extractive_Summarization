they 're known for being one of the most rancid - smelling animals and would seem to be the most unlikely of pets			2
but @entity4 keeps 50 of the animals in her own home ; they are given free reign of the five - bedroom house - even sleeping on @entity4 's bed			1

' she added : ' i have a lot of skunks in the house , they 've all got different personalities			2
' some are nice , some are not			0

' but , no matter what the issue is , we treat them all like family			0

she said : ' i have to get up early to start the daily routine of feeding and cleaning every single skunk in the house - that takes three hours alone			1
' i then go to work and when i 'm home at the end of the day the routine starts all over again			0
' it 's tiring but it all the running around has actually made me much healthier			0
if i did n't have so many skunks i would n't be so limber and so energetic			0
