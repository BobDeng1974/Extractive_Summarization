click here to read the full story ... the arrivals to @entity3 of @entity4 and @entity5 have brought @entity6 firmly into the @entity8 spotlight			1
each deal was protracted by the funding group ’s involvement as the @entity12 sought guarantees over the ownership of the players ’ economic rights			1
but just who are @entity6 and what do they do ? @entity6 is an investment fund supported by a collection of wealthy – and anonymous – businessmen speculating on the purchase of footballers to make money			2
instead of buying up players ’ economic rights , as with other third - party ownership schemes , @entity6 loan money to clubs to assist in transfers of notable targets who would otherwise be unaffordable			2
welcome along : @entity5 was unveiled at @entity33 following his £ 16million transfer from @entity35 when a player is sold a percentage hitherto agreed is returned , meaning @entity38 reap a share of any profit			1
alternatively repayments of initial loans are expected within three years at a set interest rate – as with any lending bank – but in general there remains an impetus for transfers to be made			0
on their website it reads : ‘ our partners include some of the world ’s pre-eminent law firms , financial advisors , sports consultants and football agents , giving the company and its clients confidence and protection in the investment decisions			1
’ who is behind the scheme ? @entity65 , a 35 - year - old @entity66 entrepreneur , is the chief executive and main face of @entity6			2
about four years ago he approached two wealthy businessmen and proposed his idea for enjoying football and making a profit from it – thus beginning the company			2
@entity65 is said to have learned his trade under @entity75 , the super-agent involved in bringing @entity77 to @entity78 , and has close relationships with many of the game ’s biggest boardroom figures , including @entity83 , @entity85 ’s larger - than - life president			2
new signing : but @entity87 defender @entity4 is yet to make his debut for @entity89 ‘ the money is only one part , the most important part is the networking , ’ @entity65 said in an interview with @entity91 from may			1
‘ i know all the sports directors , all the presidents			0
they ’re my friends for so many years			0
there ’s a friendship situation in order to negotiate			0
’ @entity100 , the agent of @entity102 and @entity103 , and @entity104 , former @entity33 and @entity78 chief executive , have been incorrectly linked to @entity6			1
their vehicle is a third - party ownership model called @entity108			0
in april last year @entity109 was launched to manage the commercial aspect of elite footballers , including @entity112			0
it is run by managing directors @entity114 , a key strategist in @entity117 ’s team for 10 years , and @entity118 , who has managed the images of @entity102 and @entity103 among others			0
not him : @entity100 , the agent of @entity102 ( pictured ) , has been incorrectly linked to @entity6 how much money are we talking and which players are involved ? so far € 100million ( about £ 80m ) has been invested in players , with another € 100m on the way			1
@entity65 says the sums are ‘ drops in the ocean ’ for the group ’s multi-millionaire backers			0
one of the company ’s biggest and earliest transactions was in 2011 , when @entity134 switched from @entity135 to @entity136 for £ 34.7m , even though the @entity138 club was in deep debt			1
last summer he moved to @entity140 for £ 51m and is on the market again this window , although @entity38 ’s interest in his transfer ended when @entity140 bought in full			1
@entity38 claimed a third of @entity4 ’s transfer to @entity89 , having assisted @entity135 with his move in 2011 , and are owed 75 per cent of @entity5 ’s transfer although a dispute with @entity35 has broken out and no money has been handed over to date			1
on @entity38 ’s website names such as @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 are listed but it is not stated in what capacity they are linked			1
subject : on @entity6 ’s website @entity85 's @entity153 ( right ) is listed but it is not stated in what capacity @entity136 have a wide - ranging financial agreement with @entity6 that allows them to buy players they could otherwise not afford			1
‘ we are sharing the risk , ’ @entity136 chief executive @entity164 says			2
‘ it ’s an interesting transaction because if the player does n’t do well the club does n’t lose everything			0
’ recently @entity6 has announced an agreement with @entity172 and that it financed @entity135 ’s deal for @entity176 @entity175 star @entity174 from @entity177			1
what is the global reception to @entity6 ? @entity138 ’s top - flight is very welcoming , with @entity182 president @entity181 arguing @entity6 offer the funds to provide smaller clubs the chance to compete when @entity85 and @entity188 hog the tv money			1
@entity138 football clubs have a combined tax debt of £ 550m			0
but the @entity12 is extremely sceptical and would not allow @entity6 to finance any deals entered into by clubs in @entity8 ’s top division			1
third - party ownership was outlawed after the @entity196 and @entity197 affair and even though @entity6 state firmly their model is different and does not exert influence on clubs , the @entity12 remain wary			2
they have concerns relating to funding schemes imposing penalties for non-sale of players			0
doyen insist they do not employ such measures			0
rule : third - party ownership was outlawed after the @entity196 and @entity197 affair a @entity12 spokesman told @entity213 : ‘ @entity12 rules prohibit @entity215 as we believe that it threatens the integrity of competitions , reduces the flow of transfer revenue contained within the game , and has the potential to exert external influences on players ’ transfer decisions			0
‘ when our clubs enter into negotiations to sign players from countries where the practice is permitted we work with them to make sure any third parties are bought out			0
this has to take place before a player can be registered to play in the @entity12			0
’ a row between @entity35 ’s new president @entity237 and @entity38 broke out when he claimed the club were being put under pressure to sell @entity240 to @entity33			1
@entity38 insisted this was not the case and could take @entity35 to court for their refusal to hand over any money			2
@entity245 want to ban the practice , while @entity247 have conducted various studies into its feasibility			0
doyen are keen to distance themselves from other third - party entities and would welcome tighter regulations			0
