' i had no way of telling where i was ' , ms @entity5 told sunday night			2

twelve days after she went missing , ms @entity5 decided to face her fear of crocodiles and head down to the water to see if she could find her way out by following the river			1
after swimming downstream all day , she crawled onto a rock in the middle of the river and slept there , waking up the next morning to discover she had begun to menstruate			2

ms @entity5 became lost in dense bushland after wandering off from the fishing spot where she had spent the day with her fiancee
her clothes were ripped from her by the unforgiving *native* plants and she was left naked in the bush without food or a way to contact anyone
the bush was home to many dangerous *animals* such as snakes , spiders , leeches , cassowaries and crocodiles
a huge search party was organised who looked for her for 15 days before it was called off when many believed she had died in the bush
she suffered many injuries *including* bites , scratches , severe sunburn and infections and lost 17 kilos from the ordeal
after 17 days lost in the bush she finally emerged and was *reunited* with her fiancee and children
