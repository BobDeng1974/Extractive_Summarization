@entity0 is preparing its fleet of martian scacecraft and rovers for a unique front row seat as a comet passes close by			0
@entity7 / 2013 @entity6 , also known as comet @entity8 , will pass within about 87,000 miles ( 139,500 kilometers ) of the @entity9 on sunday - less than half the distance between @entity11 and our moon , and less than one - tenth the distance of any known comet flyby of @entity11			1
researchers say it will provide an unprecedented opportunity to gather data on both the comet and its effect on the @entity9 atmosphere			1
closest approach to @entity26 is on october 19 , 2014			0
spacecraft will collect in a ' duck and cover ' move to avoid dust from the comet @entity8 's nucleus will come closest to @entity26 around 11:27 a.m. @entity34 ( 2:27 p.m. edt ) , hurtling at about 126,000 mph ( 56 kilometers per second )			1
this proximity will provide an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to gather data on both the comet and its effect on the @entity9 atmosphere			1
' this is a cosmic science gift that could potentially keep on giving , and the agency 's diverse science missions will be in full receive mode , ' said @entity47 , astronaut and associate administrator for @entity0 's @entity49 in @entity50			0
' this particular comet has never before entered the inner solar system , so it will provide a fresh source of clues to our solar system 's earliest days			1
' @entity0 's @entity26 orbiters lining up behind @entity26 for their ' duck and cover ' maneuver to shield them from comet dust that may result from the close flyby of @entity6 ( @entity6 ) on oct. 19 , 2014			1
@entity8 came from the @entity63 , a spherical region of space surrounding our sun and occupying space at a distance between 5,000 and 100,000 astronomical units			2
it is a giant swarm of icy objects believed to be material left over from the formation of the solar system			1
@entity8 will be the first comet from the @entity63 to be studied up close by spacecraft , giving scientists an invaluable opportunity to learn more about the materials , including water and carbon compounds , that existed during the formation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago			1
this graphic depicts the orbit of comet c / 2013 @entity85 as it swings around the sun in 2014			0
some of the best and most revealing images and science data will come from assets orbiting and roving the surface of @entity26			0
in preparation for the comet flyby , @entity0 maneuvered its @entity95 orbiter , @entity96 , and the newest member of the @entity26 fleet , @entity99 ( @entity99 ) , in order to reduce the risk of impact with high - velocity dust particles coming off the comet			0
the period of greatest risk to orbiting spacecraft will start about 90 minutes after the closest approach of the comet 's nucleus and will last about 20 minutes , when @entity26 will come closest to the center of the widening trail of dust flying from the nucleus			2
@entity6 comes from the @entity63 , material left over from the formation of the solar system			1
' this comet is coming into the solar system straight from the @entity63			1
it 's likely this is its first time this close to the sun , ' said space scientist @entity123 , of the @entity125 ( @entity125 ) in @entity126 , @entity127			0
@entity63 material , including comets , is scattered through a vast region that begins outside the orbits of @entity132 and @entity133 and extends a substantial fraction of the distance to @entity136 , the closest neighboring star			1
@entity63 comets can tell scientists about the materials - including water and carbon compounds - that existed during the formation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago			1
the images above show -- before and after filtering -- comet @entity6 , also known as @entity8 , as captured by @entity148 on @entity0 's @entity149			1
studying this close encounter will be the largest fleet of orbiting scientific observatories ever flown to another world , orbiting around ( and rolling on the ground of ) @entity26			0
these instruments will , for the first time ever , have the chance to make close - up observations of a comet new to the inner solar system			1
and though it will not be the easiest task , the teams operating these instruments and spacecraft have developed plans to take advantage of this rare opportunity			2
siding spring is small ( the nucleus is less than a mile in diameter ) and fast ( it will pass @entity26 at about 34 miles per second )			1
@entity170 , @entity171 , and @entity96 were built to study a slowly - moving planet , so they will use @entity96 's ability to rotate in order to capture images as the comet speeds by @entity26			2
the instruments will observe the comet repeatedly for two and a half days as it gets closer and closer to @entity26 before it makes its closest approach			0
the peak density of comet dust at @entity26 is expected 98 minutes after closest approach of the nucleus , and the @entity96 spacecraft will position itself behind the planet at that time			2
how graphic shows the science observations that may be captured by @entity26 spacecraft during the close encounter with @entity6 ( @entity6 )			2
' the hazard is not an impact of the comet nucleus itself , but the trail of debris coming from it			0
using constraints provided by @entity11 - based observations , the modeling results indicate that the hazard is not as great as first anticipated			0
@entity26 will be right at the edge of the debris cloud , so it might encounter some of the particles -- or it might not , ' said @entity203 , chief scientist for the @entity204 at @entity0 's @entity205 in @entity206 , @entity207			0
the atmosphere of @entity26 , though much thinner that @entity11 's , will shield @entity209 and curiosity from comet dust , if any reaches the planet			2
both rovers are scheduled to make observations of the comet			0
@entity0 's @entity26 orbiters will gather information before , during and after the flyby about the size , rotation and activity of the comet 's nucleus , the variability and gas composition of the coma around the nucleus , and the size and distribution of dust particles in the comet 's tail			2
on oct. 19 , the comet will have a very close pass at @entity26 , just 82,000 miles ( 132,000 kilometers ) from the planet			1
observations of the @entity9 atmosphere are designed to check for possible meteor trails , changes in distribution of neutral and charged particles , and effects of the comet on air temperature and clouds			0
@entity99 will have a particularly good opportunity to study the comet , and how its tenuous atmosphere , or coma , interacts with @entity26 ' upper atmosphere			0
@entity11 - based and space telescopes , including @entity0 's iconic @entity149 , also will be in position to observe the unique celestial object			0
the agency 's astrophysics space observatories -- @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 -- and the ground - based @entity261 on @entity262 , @entity263 -- also will be tracking the event .			0

will provide an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to gather data
