by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:00 est , 30 march 2013 updated : 12:29 est , 1 april 2013 a mother whose desperately ill baby was treated at @entity6 ’s children ’s heart centre told how she believed his life was only saved when she insisted on transferring him to another unit			1
all children ’s heart surgery was suspended at the hospital last week , after mortality rates were said to be twice the national average			1
this followed @entity17 ’s story last week exposing the scandal			2
@entity19 , 19 , watched her son @entity21 ’s condition steadily worsen after he was born 14 months ago in @entity22 with four heart defects			1
@entity19 had been told that her baby @entity21 could never be cured by @entity25			1
but , when she moved him to @entity28 in @entity29 , they said his heart condition could be fixed after an operation at eight weeks old , @entity21 was placed on a ‘ palliative care pathway ’ , meaning his life could be prolonged but his condition would not be cured			1
@entity19 and her mother , @entity34 , 42 , became concerned at @entity21 ’s listless state , frequent breathlessness and bluish pallor , but trusted the doctors caring for him			1
but in january 2013 , @entity19 ’s elder sister @entity39 , 22 , home from university , urged her mother : ‘ @entity43 , act quickly please , @entity21 looks dead			1
’ @entity34 said : ‘ i ’d done my homework and spoken to other parents and they just told me to get him to @entity29 , so that ’s what i did			1
‘ i insisted to @entity6 that they transfer him			2
although they did try and put us off and said it was a bad idea because it could take days for all the notes to be sent , they did refer him there			2
hollie with her 14 - month - old son @entity21			1
the mother said that his personality has come out since receiving treatment in @entity29 ‘ but my point is that patients should n’t have to push for that – they should always be offered a second opinion somewhere else in complicated cases			1
’ just two days after he arrived at @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity21 ’s astonished family were told his poorly heart could be fixed			1
@entity34 said : ‘ at this point we had lived a year knowing @entity21 was on palliative care only			1
the thought he could be taken away at any time is any parent ’s nightmare			2
’ @entity19 , a student nurse from @entity72 , @entity73 , whose studies were put on hold by @entity21 ’s arrival , said the transformation in her son since his operation was amazing			1
‘ i ’ve really got to know him in the last few weeks and he ’s developed a personality which you could n’t really see before as he was always crying or asleep			2
he ’s a different boy and i ’m so glad my mum pushed for us to be transferred			2
’ this week @entity21 , who has had to be fed through a tube all his short life , will have it removed from his nose for the first time as he gets stronger			1
mrs @entity34 added : ‘ i was n’t surprised that they suspended operations at @entity22 this week , but i do feel for all the children and families waiting for treatment			1
’ the @entity17 has also learned that a four - year - old girl died at the unit ten days ago after a relatively straightforward procedure to remove muscle from her heart			1
the girl ’s angry mother wrote on @entity100 last week : ‘ i will fight to the end to find out who did this to her as the surgeon could n’t tell me how it happened			0
i have raised money to keep @entity22 open myself and i wish i could take it all back			1
’ the suspension of operations at @entity22 was sparked by a @entity17 inquiry			1
last week we reported that one of two consultant surgeons at the unit had been secretly banned from operating			0
the hospital ’s failure to announce that decision until contacted by the @entity119 raised questions over the @entity121 , partly brought in following the @entity123 heart scandal in which more than 30 children died			2
archbishop of york dr. @entity125 wants @entity127 to intervene over the @entity22 general hospital scandal the archbishop of @entity130 has called on health secretary @entity127 to intervene over the controversial decision to suspend children 's congenital heart surgery at @entity6 ( @entity6 )			1
the hospital is carrying out an internal review after data suggested a death rate twice the national average			2
doubts have been cast over the reliability of the mortality figures after it emerged they did not include scores of operations carried out by the unit			0
dr @entity125 , who has backed campaigners in their battle to keep children 's heart surgery in @entity22 , visited the unit today in a ' pilgrimage of prayer and trust '			1
speaking at the hospital , the archbishop asked mr @entity127 to ' speedily ' conduct his own review into the unit , which was ordered after opposition to plans to stop surgery in @entity22			1
dr @entity125 told @entity161 : ' the data on which it was based to close these surgical procedures needs to be analysed fast and quick			2
' if it turns out not to be accurate then somebody 's got to come clean about it			0
' they should carry out what the court has asked and what the @entity170 has embarked on and do it speedily and quickly and without any bias at all			0
' i 'd ask the secretary of state really to intervene and come in pretty fast			0
' dr @entity125 said he believes medical director of @entity178 sir @entity177 would have " a lot of questions to answer " if the mortality results proved inaccurate			0
he added : " all i can say is that if the data and the research has n't been properly analysed , i would have thought you would have paused , come to the actual clinic and see what 's going on			0
' i hope mr @entity177 has the facts but if he has n't then he 's got a lot of questions to answer			0
' campaigners have criticised the suspension of surgery and its timing , which came 24 hours after a high court judge ruled the decision - making process to close the children 's unit was ' legally flawed '			2
a spokesman from @entity178 said tonight : ' we agree with the trust 's decision to launch this review			0
it is really important that this review is carried out in a sensible , effective and decisive way			0
' for that to happen it needs to follow a proper and complete process			0
it can not be conducted in the media			0
' the data and other information that triggered this precautionary pause have raised questions but they have not provided answers			0
that is the job of the review			0
' it is important that the review is allowed to do its work properly and reach a decisive conclusion on behalf of patients			0
' the surgeon ’s suspension , due to ‘ concerns over his practice ’ , left the unit with only one permanent consultant surgeon – who was on holiday – and two locums			0
matters were so desperate a surgeon from @entity233 had to fly in at weekends			0
one expert described the unit as ‘ dangerously dysfunctional ’			0
former heart tsar professor sir @entity235 , who heads the central unit analysing cardiac mortality data , was informed of the surgeon ’s suspension by the @entity119 last saturday as @entity22 had not announced the move			1
he alerted @entity121 chiefs not only to the death rates at the unit , but also the crisis sparked by the suspension			0
sir @entity235 said : ‘ i would not have been able to sleep this weekend knowing that there were people who might have been operated on in a potentially unsafe environment			0
’ he passed on his concerns to professor sir @entity177 , medical director of @entity178 , who ordered that surgery be suspended on thursday			0
campaigners have criticised the suspension of surgery and its timing , 24 hours after a high court judge ruled that the decision - making process to close the children ’s unit was ‘ legally flawed ’			2
but the accuracy of the mortality figures has been questioned after it was claimed that the results were preliminary .			0

@entity263 moved her son @entity21 to @entity28 in @entity29
while at @entity22 she was told that his heart condition could not be cured
just days after she moved him doctors said that his heart could be fixed
the 19 - year - old is *convinced* that his life was saved when she moved him from the hospital
