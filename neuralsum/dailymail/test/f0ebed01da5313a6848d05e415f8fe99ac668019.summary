@entity0 believes it is ' unthinkable ' that he will not win the masters at some point to complete the career grand slam			1
and the world number one has revealed how his final - round collapse at @entity8 in 2011 was the most important day of his career			1
@entity0 is looking to claim his first green jacket and become just the sixth player to win all four major titles after @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
@entity0 tees off at the @entity19 golf tournament in @entity20 on march 19 ' for me now it 's a career - long goal to win there to achieve something that only a handful of players have ever achieved , ' the 25 - year - old said in an interview with @entity31 @entity30			1
' there 's something special i can achieve going into @entity8 this year			1
you are a complete player if you can win every major because they are on different golf courses , different tests , different conditions			2
not many guys have done it in history so to put my name there would be awesome			2
it would just be incredible			0
' you feel the sense of what can be achieved but i ca n't think about that too much			0
i just have to think about trying to go out there and playing as best as i can and if i can do that hopefully my scores add up to a shot lower than anyone else 's			0
' @entity0 has just one top - 10 finish to his name in six @entity56 appearances , finishing joint eighth last year despite the embarrassment of being outscored by his marker in the third round			1
@entity0 is hoping to complete his grand slam of majors with a victory at @entity8 later this month but the 25 - year - old can not picture going through his career without slipping on at least one coveted green jacket			1
' during my career , yes it 's unthinkable , ' he added			2
' if i do n't win it this year ... either it 's not the right time or it is n't your time			2
if i was to look back as a 60 - year - old on my career and not have won a green jacket i 'd obviously be very , very disappointed			1
' and not just one			0
i feel like it 's a course i can do very well at and a golf course i can hopefully win multiple times on			0
obviously getting that first one is extra important and from there we can go on and maybe think about getting some others			2
' @entity0 held a four - shot lead going into the final round four years ago , only to collapse to a closing 80 and finish 10 shots behind the winner @entity86			1
but he bounced back to win his first major title by eight shots in the @entity89 two months later , before adding wins in the 2012 @entity92 @entity91 and both the @entity89 and @entity92 @entity91 last year			2
@entity0 is hoping to emulate the likes of @entity16 ( above ) by winning all four major titles ' i think it was the most important day of my career , ' he added			1
' if i had n't had the whole unravelling and say i just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one , i might not have learnt as much			0
' but for it all to come apart how it did i learnt an awful lot			0
i learnt so much about myself and my game and what i needed to do differently the next time i was in that position			0
' luckily it did n't take me long to get into a position like that again where i was leading a major and we know how that one played out			0
i was able to get over the line pretty comfortably			0
' @entity0 's extraordinary success last year came despite the distractions of calling off his wedding to @entity116 and a legal dispute with his former management company which cost him millions of pounds when it was finally settled in february			1
@entity0 's extraordinary success last year came he called off his wedding to @entity116 and he hopes he can again use the golf course as his ' sanctuary ' from the pressure and hype surrounding @entity8			1
' the golf course was my sanctuary , it was where i could get away from everything and just not have to think about it for the four or five hours that i am out there and it helped			0
it really did , ' he added			0
' i was looking forward to getting to the course and playing and practising and i think it will be the same at @entity8 because there will be so much hype and build up and talk about what could happen			1
' i know i wo n't be able to wait until thursday morning or afternoon and just get on the golf course and play golf			0
there is only so much you can talk about it and then you have to go out and try and play			0
