by @entity0 for @entity1 if @entity2 ends up pocketing $ 11.44 million on sunday , he might look back on the 14th hole of his second round of the @entity5 with particular affection			1
a rare wayward tee shot during the course of an otherwise wonderful round on friday could have been a card wrecker if it had stuck a tree and buried itself in the undergrowth			1
instead it ricocheted kindly – and ended up in a spectator ’s pocket			2
@entity2 was duly allowed a free drop , went on to make his par – and then closed with two birdies for a fabulous 65			1
‘ i think i probably owed the spectator rather more than a sweaty handshake , ’ said @entity2 , smiling			1
‘ it could have gone anywhere and it really was a lucky bounce			0
’ a disappointed @entity2 after a missed putt on the fifth green on friday world number one @entity2 hits his approach shot on the eighth hole on friday @entity2 narrowly misses out on a birdie on the first hole of his second round at @entity31 this was more like it from @entity2 , who thought he had discovered something towards the end of his scrappy opening round and duly delivered			1
a wonderful climax to the @entity38 season now seems assured this weekend with @entity2 tied for second place alongside @entity41 @entity40 and @entity43 @entity42 , who just happens to be leading the race for the @entity45 , with its alluring $ 10 million bonus			1
out on his own with a two stroke lead is last week ’s winner @entity48 , who stands number two in the @entity51 standings and , like @entity42 , will not be going to the @entity52			2
what on earth must captain @entity53 be thinking , sitting at home ? actually , @entity48 , who shot 66 to continue his hot hand , gave us an idea when he revealed he had received a text from the five time @entity62			2
it read : ‘ why did n’t you play like this earlier ? ’			0
@entity2 hits his tee shot on the eighth , on his way to a -5 round on friday a birdie on the second set @entity2 in motion for a charge up the leaderboard in his second round the @entity76 found himself in a bunker on the fourth hole - eventually his only bogey of the day @entity48 has enough on his mind , considering his wife is due to give birth in a fortnight ’s time			1
if all the excitement here causes her to go into labour , @entity48 ’s not moving			0
‘ we ’ve talked about it			0
let ’s be honest – how often do you get the chance to win a life - changing sum like $ 11.44 million ? ’ he said			2
if @entity2 , @entity48 or @entity42 win the @entity5 with its $ 1.44 million first prize , they will collect the $ 10 million as well			1
if @entity40 wins , he will need help from the other three to collect the bonus			0
@entity2 waits to putt on the sixth green during the second round of the @entity45 at @entity31 @entity2 was deep in concentration as he lined up a birdie putt on the second green @entity105 was another @entity106 representative who left contented , as he bounced back from his opening 72 with a fine 66			1
‘ it ’s funny how you can climb out of bed and not feel any different but your scorecard can change dramatically , ’ said @entity108 , who climbed to within six shots of the lead and into the top ten			0
‘ i guess it was just a cleaner round , as i cut out the mistakes			0
i also holed a few putts as well			0
’ as for the other two members of @entity122 ’s four - strong @entity52 contingent , @entity119 shot 69 while @entity124 @entity123 lies tied 14th after a 71			2
meanwhile , just to add to @entity53 ’s frustration , two of his wild card picks @entity128 and @entity129 continued to struggle with rounds of 72			0
the only players below them are a pair of disinterested - looking @entity41 – @entity134 and @entity135			0
on the second hole , @entity2 knew he needed a positive day to propel himself up the leaderboard			1

@entity2 was *-1* after *thursday* ****'s**** first round at the @entity45
the world number one ****'s**** tee shot on the 14th *landed* in a spectator ****'s**** pocket
@entity2 birdied six times on friday , and only bogeyed the fourth hole
the @entity76 ****'s**** 65 takes him a step closer to the $ 11.44m prize
