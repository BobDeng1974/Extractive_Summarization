by @entity0 @entity2 fishermen have finished killing some of the 250 dolphins trapped in what activists say was the biggest round - up they have witnessed in the last four years			1
@entity7 , best known for its anti-whaling activities , said the fishermen first selected 52 dolphins to keep alive for sale to aquariums and other customers			1
they included a rare albino calf worth millions whose mother it reports may have committed suicide after being torn apart from her baby in the brutal separation process in @entity20			1
speculation has been rife ever since @entity7 volunteers witnessed her diving under water then failing to resurface with the rest of the pod			0
experts say dolphins have been known to commit suicide in captivity after becoming distressed and confused at their conditions			1
writing on its website , @entity7 said : ' there is widespread speculation that the mother of the albino calf committed suicide after her baby was violently taken from her			1
' our volunteer @entity67 documented and witnessed the grieving mother repeatedly spy - hopping , looking for her calf , before lowering herself into the water , never to resurface			2
' dolphins are highly intelligent , socially complex beings who form close bonds with their family , and the trade for captivity regularly rips through these bonds in @entity20			1
' the theory has been taken up by @entity82 , a former dolphin trainer who is convinced the mother took her own life as a result of the ordeal			0
annual process : the fishing crew are pictured transferring several dolphins into the 250 - strong pod rounded up : the dolphins were forced to wait in the pen for 19 hours until the holding reached critical mass as conscious breathers , he said dolphins can choose not to take their next breath			1
mr @entity99 , who founded the @entity100 , told @entity101 : ' people do n't believe me , but dolphins do it all the time			2
' @entity105 is extremely stressful and there is nothing more stressful to a dolphin than taking away its calf			0
' the fishermen reportedly hid the baby dolphin under a tarpaulin and transferred it to @entity113			0
assistant director @entity114 said : ' albinos stand out and tend to be targeted by predators			0
' she must have been protected by her mother and her mates			0
we will take good care of her			0
' tradition : each year the fishermen capture and kill a huge amount of dolphins , putting the population at risk one of the crusaders from @entity7 , who hope to bring the dolphin 's plight to light ( left )			2
the fishermen preparing their nets to capture the next pod of dolphins ( right ) the albino dolphin is one of the rarest from this current batch of captured bottlenoses mr @entity82 - who used to train dolphins for the tv series @entity143 - became an activist in the 1970s after being left traumatised when one of the show 's stars , @entity148 , died in his arms			1
he has always asserted that she had committed suicide by refusing to breathe after spending years in captivity			1
there have been previous cases of suspected dolphin suicides , the largest of which occurred in 2007 when 152 striped dolphins washed up on the coast of southern @entity159			2
locals who battled to save them by taking them back out to sea were distraught when the dolphins refused and persistently re-beached themselves to die			2
a year later , one expert theorised that the deaths of 26 dolphins on a beach in @entity168 have been a mass suicide			1
the animals had died after inhaling debris and mud that clogged their insides			0
heavy machinery : fishermen hoist a dolphin out of the sea , on its way to either lifetime captivity or death speaking at the time , veterinary wildlife pathologist @entity182 said : ' on the face of it , it looks like some sort of mass suicide - but the question is why ? ' the dolphins had swallowed and inhaled big chunks of mud from the estuary			1
their lungs and stomachs were full of it			0
that is very bizarre indeed			0
' we have seen strandings on beaches , sometimes with five to seven dolphins - but never on a scale like this			2
' however , other experts are far more sceptical			2
dr @entity205 , who studies dolphins in @entity207 , believes suicide is a uniquely human notion , although she did acknowledge that animals can get depressed			1
she said : ' i think everything they are designed to be is to keep on keeping on			0
' so i think suicide is the curse of the human consciousness , but not other consciousnesses , she told told the @entity218 in 2010			2
of the rest of the 250 dolphins trapped in the @entity2 cove , about 40 were killed , one became stuck in a net and drowned and the others were released , @entity7 said			1
a video released tuesday by @entity7 shows dozens of fishermen on boats surveying the dolphins after they were confined to a cove with nets			2
divers can be seen holding the dolphins selected for sale and guiding them to nets hanging off the boats			0
boat : ' @entity234 ' use poles and flanges to make unpleasant sounds , driving the dolphins to specific places preparation : fishermen and trainers unload the orange nets yesterday - just 24 hours before decision day ( @entity246 ) the fishermen are for the most part , a selection of fishermen from the @entity251			0
( @entity252 ) one of the dolphin fences inside the cove that allows the fishermen to stand watch while other dolphins have been killed since the hunting season began in september , @entity7 said the 250 herded into the cove last friday was the largest group it has seen since it began monitoring the hunt			1
the annual hunt in the village of @entity20 received high - profile criticism when @entity265 ambassador to @entity2 @entity264 tweeted last weekend that she was deeply concerned about the practice			0
the fishermen say the hunt is part of their tradition and call foreign critics who eat other kinds of meat hypocritical			0
a @entity2 government spokesman defended the annual dolphin hunt on monday , saying it is carried out in accordance with the law			0
the hunt was the subject of the @entity281 - winning 2009 film @entity282			1
the dolphins will be uncomfortably oblivious of the impending doom some of them will suffer at the hands of the fishermen			0
they are captured around four to five at a time until enough of them are collected for ' selection ' treatment : the fishermen brutally kill the dolphins they do not set free or capture using a sharp spike or spear cramped : the cove does not provide much space for the dolphins to swim , forcing them to huddle up in groups			1
