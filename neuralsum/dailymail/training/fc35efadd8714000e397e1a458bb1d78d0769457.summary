read @entity1 's column here a final thought on the toxic fall - out between @entity4 and @entity5			1
might the @entity6 have been able to broker a rapprochement ? here were two players who had stood @entity9 through countless internationals			0
with @entity4 now saying he sought a quick resolution , a simple apology , and did not consider @entity5 a racist , was there not more common ground than was previously assumed ? the police involvement was the prime complication , yet even this may not have been insurmountable			1
in a less complicated era , matters on the football field were invariably handled by the @entity6 alone			0
the police did not want to be involved every time two players got into a fight , and the @entity6 did not want confrontations to end up in court			2
it is the reason @entity42 of @entity43 was not prosecuted for breaking @entity44 midfielder @entity46 â€™s jaw in 1988			1
could the @entity6 have told the police that they would deal with @entity5 ? did they even try ? at the time , it more appeared that they backed off the moment the police were involved			1
most likely the nature of the offence would have left them terrified ; frightened to be thought complacent , or accused of going soft and ignoring racial sensitivities if they merely tried to bring the sides together			0
yet a less punitive , swifter and more positive resolution is what @entity4 says he wanted			0
why , three years on , is the wound still sore ? why , so long after , does it continue to feel like there could have been a better way ? video @entity4 book criticises @entity27 and @entity5			2

@entity4 now says he just wanted a quick apology from @entity5
police involvement was prime complication
could @entity6 have told police they would deal with @entity5 ?
they punished @entity43 midfielder @entity42 for a punch in 1988
