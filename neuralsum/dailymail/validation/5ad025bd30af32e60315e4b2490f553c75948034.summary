a schoolgirl spent six months with four inflated balloons lodged under her scalp to grow new skin to allow doctors to cover her birthmark			1
@entity6 was born with a mole covering half her head			1
specialists warned her parents if it was left untreated , it could ultimately turn cancerous			1
medics did not want to leave the nine - year - old with a bald patch , by using a skin graft from elsewhere on her body			1
and so they decided to grow more skin on her scalp , during two complex operations			2
in what is thought to be a @entity22 first , surgeons put four balloons under her scalp in a ' mohawk '			2
@entity6 , nine , from @entity26 was born with a huge mole covering a large part of her head			1
doctors warned her parents if left untreated , it could become cancerous			1
and so , they inserted four balloons under her scalp , inflating them to grow excess skin to cover the mole they then spent six months gently inflating the balloons with more than a pint and a half of saline solution , to stretch @entity6 's skin			1
when enough excess skin had been created , the balloons were removed			2
meanwhile surgeons also removed the mole			0
then , the team were able to stretch the new skin over the gap , creating a normal scalp			1
@entity6 coped with her unusual ' hairstyle ' by drawing inspiration from her short - haired hero @entity50 and did n't complain once throughout the tough ordeal			2
her proud mother @entity52 , 34 , said : ' she was really so brave - it just did n't bother her			0
' she looked like she had buns on her head , and people used to comment on how they liked her " hairstyle "			0
' it was a long process but @entity6 showed us the strength with how brave she has been and her courage			2
' she wore a hat but then sometimes she would go out without it			0
' everyone is so proud of her			0
she just embraced what she has been through			0
she 's ever so brave			0
doctors spent six months inflating the balloons , three at first , to create extra skin			0
they then removed the mole , and used the new scalp to cover the birthmark @entity6 coped with her unusual ' hairstyle ' by drawing inspiration from her short - haired hero @entity50 and did n't complain once throughout the tough ordeal , her mother said ' it 's nice now to think that it 's all over for her			1
she looks as perfect as she did before and it 's as if it never happened			0
' in june 2013 , three balloons were inserted underneath @entity6 's scalp by plastic surgeon @entity83 at @entity84			1
gradually over the course of six months he injected saline into the balloons , every two weeks			0
as the balloons gently expanded they stretched @entity6 's scalp			1
once they reached a certain size , with almost one and a half pints of saline inside , surgeons operated on @entity6			2
they removed the balloons and then cut out the mole			2
using the excess skin created by the balloons , they were able to cover almost all of @entity6 's birthmark			1
but the excess skin was n't quite large enough and so doctors inserted a final balloon in october last year			2
her parents inflated the balloon at home until it was big enough to create enough new skin to cover the last 10 per cent of @entity6 's mole			1
in january mr @entity83 removed the last part of the birthmark and covered the gap with the remaining new skin			0
@entity6 , from @entity26 , was born with the birthmark - a pigmented melanocytic nevus - which was partially visible under her hair on the left hand side			1
the condition affects just one per cent of the population and appears on the head or neck in just 15 per cent of cases			0
the bubbly youngster was n't phased by the mark , but doctors said it should be removed as soon as she was old enough to avoid it becoming cancerous			0
' if it turned cancerous they would n't be able to remove it quickly enough because it 's such a large area and it takes such a long process , ' said mrs @entity6 , who runs a data cabling company with husband @entity136 , 37			1
@entity6 drew inspiration from her idol @entity50 when she was forced to shave all her hair off			0
she had the first three silicone balloons inserted in a line down the centre of her scalp in june 2013			2
plastic surgery specialist @entity83 at @entity84 filled them with saline every two weeks using a syringe			0
three months later - when the ' lumps ' contained almost one and a half pints - surgeons removed the skin with a mole on , and the balloons , and used her newly stretched scalp to cover it up			1
but the skin was n't quite big enough , and she had to have her head shaved again and a final balloon inserted in october last year , with her parents inflating it at home			1
a first operation to use the excess skin created by three balloons , did n't quite cover the entire mole , and so doctors inserted a fourth balloon in october last year in january after her final operation @entity6 was left with a full head of hair once more			1
it is thought the procedure has never been carried out in the @entity22 , and has only once been used in the @entity172 the final 10 per cent of the mole - along with the balloon on the side of her head - was removed in january , and now @entity6 has a perfect head of growing hair			1
' although @entity6 has scars , they are quickly fading and she is looking forward to growing her hair out again , ' said her mother			0
' she 's been amazing throughout this whole journey , taking it all in her stride with a huge smile on her face			0
' it is believed the procedure has never been done on the scalp in the @entity22 before , and only once before , in @entity172			0
mr @entity83 of @entity84 , said : ' the successful outcome of @entity6 's procedure is due to help of a wonderful team of anaesthetists , trainee surgeons , paediatric nurses , plastic surgery specialist nurses , play specialist and occupational therapists who help me make the surgical journey for the patients and their families smooth and enjoyable			0
' @entity6 and her parents were exemplary with way how they complied with all the instructions and kept smiling throughout this difficult time			0

@entity6 was born with a huge mole covering half her head
specialists warned if it was left untreated it could become cancerous
they did n't want to leave @entity6 with a bald patch , by using a skin graft from elsewhere on her body so used the *pioneering* *technique*
they inserted four balloons under her scalp to stretch the skin
they then cut out the mole , using the new skin to cover the gap left
