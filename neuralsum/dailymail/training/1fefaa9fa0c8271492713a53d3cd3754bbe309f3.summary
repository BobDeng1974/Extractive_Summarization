an astronaut conducting a spacewalk outside the @entity2 today reported dangerous water leak in his helmet - a problem reminiscent of a near - drowning in orbit two years ago			1
flight engineer , @entity8 , reported the water while he waited in the air lock for today 's spacewalk to formally conclude			1
the amount of water increased slightly , but he appeared to be in no immediate danger , said @entity16 astronaut @entity15 , who helped to remove his suit			2
@entity8 reported the water while he waited in the air lock for wednesday 's spacewalk to formally conclude			1
the amount of water increased slightly , but he appeared to be in no immediate danger , said @entity16 astronaut @entity15 , who helped to remove his suit in 2013 , another @entity16 astronaut , @entity23 , barely got back into the space station after a considerable amount of water filled his helmet during a spacewalk			2
the water escaped from his suit 's cooling system			2
@entity31 spent months investigating the mishap , before clearing the way for more spacewalks			0
today 's problem did n't impact the spacewalk which saw @entity37 join fellow astronaut @entity38 on a 6.5 hours mission to prepare parking spots for future ' space taxis '			1
a camera fixed to the astronaut 's spacesuits provided stunning shots of the @entity2 and @entity47 , as the astronaut 's grapple with lubrication of the latches and brackets			1
astronauts floated outside the @entity2 earlier today in the second of three spacewalks to prepare parking spots for future ' space taxis ' a camera fixed to the astronaut 's spacesuits provided stunning shots of the @entity2 and @entity47 , as the astronaut 's grapple with lubrication of the latches and brackets @entity38 took a moment to savor the view			1
' i do n't think i 've seen blue that blue , ' he observed above the @entity64			0
the spacewalkers struggled to remove a cover protecting the berthing slip , one of two sites being reconfigured for new spaceships under development by @entity72 and @entity73			0
' this thing has rigidified out here , ' @entity38 radioed to flight controllers in @entity77			0
' that 's as expected , so good luck with that , ' replied astronaut @entity81 at @entity82			2
station commander @entity38 , call sign @entity84 , is wearing a suit with red stripes and is using helmet camera no. 18			0
@entity8 , @entity84 - 2 , is wearing an unmarked suit is using helmetcam 20			1
the cover 's removal was another step to prepare the station for new international docking port adapters that are due to arrive later this year			1
in this image , @entity94 is dwarfed by @entity96 as he prepares the @entity2 for the @entity98 module ' orbital sunrise on @ @entity100 during the # spacewalk , ' @entity31 tweeted alongside this stunning image station commander @entity38 , 52 , and flight engineer @entity8 ( pictured ) , 47 , left the station 's quest airlock just after 7 am est ( 1200 gmt ) and headed to the space shuttle 's old docking port			1
the adapters will be installed during four more spacewalks @entity31 plans in 2015			1
construction of the @entity2 began on 20 november 1998			2
it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three			0
the station orbits at a height of about 255 miles ( 410km )			0
it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds ( 450,000kg ) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five - bedroom house			0
it completes an orbit of @entity47 every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles ( 27,600km ) per hour			0
it has now been in space for more than 5,900 days , during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of @entity47 , and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years			0
on saturday , @entity38 and @entity37 installed about 340ft ( 104 metres ) of power and data cables to support the new docking systems			1
during today 's spacewalk , scheduled to last about 6.5 hours , they plan to attach two more cables and lubricate the grapple fixture at the end of the station 's robot arm			0
the spacewalkers will also prepare the ' @entity138 ' connecting node for the september arrival of an experimental inflatable habitat built by privately - owned @entity98			1
@entity142 - based @entity98 is developing free - flying expandable habitats for lease by agencies , researchers and businesses			0
@entity31 is looking at the technology for future human expeditions beyond the station 's 260 - mile ( 418 - km ) high orbit			1
the station , a partnership of 15 nations , is a collection of laboratories and platforms for materials and life science experiments , @entity47 studies , physics and other investigations that take advantage of the microgravity environment and unique vantage point of space			0
the @entity167 @entity167 said yesterday it would remain part of the international outpost until 2024 , a four - year extension proposed by the @entity171			0
' @entity172 captured a # spacewalk selfie with his reflection in @ @entity100 radiator panel , ' @entity31 tweeted during today 's spacewalk , which lasted about 6.5 hours , astronauts attached two more cables and lubricated the grapple fixture at the end of the station 's robot arm astronauts @entity38 ( left ) and @entity37 ( right ) began the second of three jobs in preparation of private space taxis			2
