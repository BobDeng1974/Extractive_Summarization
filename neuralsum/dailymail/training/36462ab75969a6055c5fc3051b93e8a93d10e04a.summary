by @entity0 new spin : the parody video plays off of @entity4 's @entity3 show @entity5 @entity4 fans had reason to rejoice tuesday morning as comedian @entity8 released a parody video of his show , @entity5			1
the parody version took the writer 's iconic walk - and - talks , moral dilemmas and sexual politics to a different venue : a fast food restaurant			1
' the @entity19 ' gives a four - minute foray into the fictitious world of @entity22 , where a cranky male manager is in a moral lock - of - horns with his corporate overlords			0
sound familiar ? similar plot lines have been used in many of @entity4 's shows , whether it be the latest iteration in the newsroom or earlier series like @entity32			2
( if ' corporate ' was subbed out for ' republicans ' , there would be examples in @entity37 as well			0
) showing that the spoof was done in good fun , the male protagonist was played by @entity32 alum @entity41 , while his pesky female sidekick and former flame is taken on by @entity8			1
walk - and - talk : the parody film was made by comedian @entity8 ( seen in the background ) and @entity41 , who previously starred in @entity4 's earlier tv series @entity32 in the clip , @entity41 ' charactor @entity48 ( which is a clear homage to @entity52 's character in @entity5 , @entity53 ) is resistant to a healthy change that his overlords want to make in adding apple slices to their kids meals			1
' silly me , i thought we stood for something around here , ' @entity59 says in disgust			0
@entity8 , whose sketch comedy show will feature the clip on her @entity68 show tonight , goes on to buck him up and encourage him to take first the pragmatic route before returning to his moral high ground			0
moral highground : though the spoof centers around a fast food chain 's resistance to healthy food , it takes its cues from themes seen in much of @entity4 's work big finish : the romantic sub plot also mimics the gender relations on @entity4 's shows in a romantic interlude , she takes a jab at the way in which @entity4 's female characters are portrayed as at times hapless and entirely beholden to their love interests			1
poking fun : @entity4 has taken part in previous parodies , including one on @entity96 ' i worked my way up to be a @entity100 of a @entity101 in @entity102 , and then one day , i was stuffing cous cous into a calzone and then one day i realized a woman 's life is worth nothing except if she 's making a great man greater , ' she says as they share a private moment by a deep fryer			2
this is far from the first time that @entity4 's distinctive style has been spoofed by famous fans , as former @entity37 stars have created their own videos in the guise of their old characters to help get out the vote for one of their siblings who was running for office			1
the @entity125 - winning writer himself has poked fun at his walk - and - talk formula in an appearance in @entity96			0
@entity4 is currently believed to be putting the final touches on the script for @entity5 's third season which will air in september , but he has appearances scheduled at the @entity133 next week and the @entity134 in june , where he is being honored with their @entity136			0
until the @entity3 show returns , or his fast - paced writing style gets back on the big screen with his @entity142 biopic , fans can get quick refresher through the spoof			2
inside @entity145 more : @entity68 , @entity146 , funny tv shows			0

spoof video made by comedian @entity8 mocks the newsroom
stars @entity41 as a manager of a fast food restaurant who stands up against the higher - up 's orders to add apple slices to the menu
@entity4 fans will see many thematic jabs at the writer 's distinctive style
