by @entity0 published : 06:33 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 06:55 est , 14 august 2013 in an age where women are liberated , have choices and careers and economic equality , why are we still putting up with men behaving badly ? what ’s with @entity9 putting up with new dad @entity10 ’s blatant unavailability - both emotional and physical - when he should be beaming by her side , being proud and protective			1
@entity14 giving @entity15 a zillion second chances when she has visual evidence - her smashed up face - of what ‘ love ’ means to him			0
what 's with @entity9 putting up with new @entity10 's blatant unavailability ? @entity25 ’s mini-tribe of exes all sobbing that they should have been the one to father his love child			1
why exactly ? yes , i get the yacht / jet / diamond appeal but seriously , who really wants to spend their life with a man who collects their exes rather than puts them in the past , where exes are supposed to be			1
why is @entity38 sniffing around @entity40 ’s ex @entity39 ? what am i missing ? yes , we should all be entitled to make and learn from our mistakes but what message is this sending teenage girls , who we know are obsessed with celebrity ? @entity25 's mini-tribe of exes all sobbing that they should have been the one to father his love child			1
why exactly ? what ’s wrong with going for the nice guy ? women have always been brainwashed into the appeal of the ‘ bad boy ’			1
the drama of it all is seen as exciting			0
there ’s the ‘ hot ’ make - up sex after the fights ; the heady rebellion of going for someone who only thinks about now , does n’t care about the future			2
when you ’re 18 and tentatively exploring life and sex and relationships , this can be appealing			0
but as an adult , who can be bothered with the reality of dating a guy who ’s never on time ( if he bothers turning up at all ) , who has no money , drug or alcohol problems , an inability to plan ahead , an allergic reaction to a mere whiff of commitment , no real goals or ambition and loathes your friends and family ( but not half as much as they loathe him )			1
my definition of a bad guy is this : it ’s someone who does n’t treat you nicely			1
the stereotype that nice equals weak is false			2
studies show nice people are not necessarily less assertive or competitive than ‘ difficult ’ people			2
@entity0 says women have been ' brainwashed ' into liking bad boys and that nice does n't equal boring ‘ @entity99 is boring ’ also does n’t stand up to scrutiny			1
unless ‘ boring ’ means calling when they ’re supposed to and being where they ’re supposed to be , with the person they ’re supposed to be with			2
‘ @entity99 is average looking ’ is shot to smithereens by @entity106 topping @entity108 polls worldwide and also being a nice guy			2
‘ @entity99 ’ is n’t just an throwaway word by the way : it ’s measurable			2
psychologists define nice people as those who score high on a personality trait called agreeableness			1
if you ’re nice , your over-riding concern is having happy , positive relationships with other people			0
you like harmony and you do n’t like upsetting people			0
nice people are generous , trustworthy , reliable and considerate			0
they do n’t play games because they do n’t like to make other people feel uncomfortable			0
the ability to be able to ‘ put yourself in someone else ’s shoes ’ or ‘ see how your partner sees ’ is a hugely positive factor in relationships			0
this is the automatic default for the average nice guy			0
studies show agreeable people also stay married longer , are more intimate in their marriages , have better relationships with their kids and - not surprisingly - are more satisfied with their lives overall			0
@entity142 closed for any female who has even a hint of intelligence and high self - esteem			0
