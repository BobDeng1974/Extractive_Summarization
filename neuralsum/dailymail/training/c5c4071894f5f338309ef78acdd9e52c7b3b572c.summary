@entity0 were not in decline when i left ... @entity3 was sacked because his team were too slow i had nothing to do with @entity3 ' sacking sir @entity7 reveals he spoke to @entity8 and @entity9 about their @entity0 futures ... but insists he kept ' respectful ' distance after he retired sir @entity7 has revealed he tried to talk @entity3 into retaining @entity12 as @entity0 's assistant manager when he took over at @entity14 last year			1
@entity3 brought in his own backroom staff when he took over , with @entity12 and first - team coach @entity16 among those leaving the club after @entity7 's 26 - and - a - half year reign came to an end			1
@entity3 time at @entity14 lasted less than a year with many critics citing a lack of succession planning from @entity7 as the main reason for his successor 's failures			2
@entity3 did not take sir @entity7 's advice and keep @entity12 as part of his backroom team @entity7 thought it would be a good idea for @entity12 to stay at @entity0 to provide continuity @entity3 brought in his own backroom team at @entity0 , including assistant manager @entity35 , coaches @entity36 and @entity37 as well as goalkeeping coach @entity38 @entity7 claims everything was in place at @entity0 to enable @entity3 to succeed the front cover of @entity7 's autobiography but in the new chapters of the latest version of my autobiography - officially released on thursday but leaked on tuesday afternoon , @entity7 insists that everything was in place for @entity3 to succeed			1
@entity7 says : ' maybe @entity3 felt that at such a massive club he had to be sure that all corners were covered in terms of his support system			2
' i felt that network was already there , with plenty of great people already in important slots			0
' @entity3 instead chose to bring in his own team with @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity38 and @entity58 joining him in moving from @entity59			1
@entity7 adds : ' there appears to be an accepted view out there that there was no process			0
we feel we did everything the right way : quietly , thoroughly , professionally			0
' @entity7 believes that the former @entity59 manager did not appreciate just how big @entity0 were as a club and had found it ' a massive jump ' from @entity72 to @entity14			1
@entity7 adds in the new edition of his autobiography that @entity3 went against @entity0 's traditions by adopting a more conservative style of playing			1
' the reason for playing at speed was that @entity0 players had been accustomed to operating that way , ' @entity7 writes			2
' if the tempo slowed for any reason , i would be into them at half - time			0
' " this is not us , " i would say			0
playing with speed never hindered our results			0
it was our way : energy and determination in the last third of the pitch			0
