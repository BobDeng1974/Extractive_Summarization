at school i always bridled at teachers who referred to us as ‘ young people ’			0
invariably they were icky groovers , smelling of toothpaste and piety			0
yesterday the same rebellion rose in my gorge while watching a creepy @entity12 - @entity11 tv show that forced party leaders to matey up to selected yoofs			1
@entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and that @entity18 from the @entity19 took turns to be quizzed			1
the programme , @entity21 ( did they mean the ratings figures ? ) , was all about ‘ young people ’ and their alleged indifference to electoral politics			1
the camera angles were look - at - me edgy , all wobbly with up - the - nose shots			1
@entity31 : @entity15 ( pictured second from left ) poses for a photo with the @entity12 / @entity11 youngsters the late - teen / early 20s inquisitors , pretty plainly politics obsessives , soon had mr @entity15 in trouble by asking what ‘ life experience ’ he had to be @entity39			1
@entity40 should have said ‘ more than you , wonkface ’ or ‘ it ’s the middle of the day , why are n’t you festering in your bed ? ’			0
instead he scrunched his lips and claimed , in that frogman - still - wearing - a - snorkel voice , that ‘ ah ’ve done a number of things ’			1
he had been a @entity50 spin doctor and had briefly taught ( politics ) at @entity52			0
that had given him ‘ the ability , i hope , to engage and listen to people ’			0
normal 20 - somethings would have treated this lame answer to hog - whimpering derision and armfarts			1
the political trainspotters recruited by @entity12 heard it in respectful silence			1
mr @entity16 , when his turn came , discarded his tie – hey , look , i ’m a cool guy ! – and went all glottal - stoppy and @entity67			1
his @entity68 of @entity70 act was embarrassing , belittling , wet – just like the programme			2
public school - educated @entity72 started saying ‘ coontry ’ instead of ‘ country ’ , ‘ loonchtime ’ instead of ‘ lunchtime ’			2
we had ‘ kindof ’ this and ‘ kinda ’ that , and he gave his sentences a @entity82 - surfer uplift			2
yet the credulous boobies fell for it			0
thus is our politics infantilised			0
at least he and @entity87 ’ kept their ties on			0
he was asked what he thought about prime minister ’s questions ( one of the so - called youngsters , who actually looked quite middle - aged , trotted out the @entity93 view that rowdiness in the @entity95 is disgraceful )			1
the late - teen / early 20s inquisitors soon had mr @entity15 ( pictured centre ) in trouble by asking what ‘ life experience ’ he had to be pm mr @entity17 was also asked about the price of tampons			1
the show was fronted by @entity12 ’s political editor , one @entity104			1
amazing to think this chump is successor to the serious , worldly @entity107			0
in his shiny suit , the twinkly - eyed @entity108 could have been an under - manager at a boutique hotel			2
he kept mewing about what ‘ young people ’ were interested in			0
to keep the little darlings interested , the producers had laid on ping - pong , table football , a sweetie stall			2
@entity108 ’s co-presenter @entity121 showed us these and even announced that there was ‘ a break - out zone , as young people call it ’			2
after the show @entity108 and @entity121 repeatedly told us how ‘ extraordinary ’ the programme had been			2
right ! the @entity19 ’ @entity129 , in her session , announced she wanted ‘ peaceful political revolution ’			0
given that this involved encouraging more immigration and scrapping council tenants ’ right - to - buy , it was open to question how peaceful such a revolution could be			2
@entity17 ( pictured ) was asked about prime minister 's questions - and the price of tampons @entity16 ( pictured right ) discarded his tie and went all glottal - stoppy and @entity67			1
his @entity68 of @entity70 act was embarrassing , belittling and wet but her views went little challenged			0
ms @entity129 said she had been a feminist since the age of five			0
have n’t we all , dear ? there was no sign of @entity150 ’s @entity149			0
apparently he was in @entity152			0
perhaps he had spotted a stitch - up in the offing			0
instead it was @entity15 who was kippered , and not just with that excruciating piffle about his ‘ life experience ’			1
after his main session , he was pursued by a scruffy @entity12 hack who in a selfie - stick interview asked what @entity40 had done when he was 18			1
our hero said he had been just like any other teenager , really : he had lived in @entity167 with his marxist - historian father , had ‘ cared a lot about the world , been very interested in @entity172 politics and global issues ’ – and had ‘ drunk a bit too much ’			0
do we believe him ? is the problem with @entity15 not that , rather like the eggheads assembled at yesterday ’s patronising @entity12 / @entity11 stunt , he has perhaps never drunk quite enough ?			1

leaders attended @entity12 - @entity11 show , @entity21 and be counted
@entity15 was asked what ' life experience ' he had to be the prime minister
@entity16 discarded his tie and put on an embarrasing @entity188 act
@entity17 was asked about pm questions and the price of tampons
