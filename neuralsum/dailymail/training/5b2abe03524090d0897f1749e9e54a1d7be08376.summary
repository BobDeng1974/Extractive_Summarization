’ it shows 20 pictures of a man she calls ‘ @entity27 ’ taking advantage of her phone aboard the @entity30 , @entity41 ’s @entity40 blog originally reported			2
the disgruntled cruise - goer was able to see the pictures because of an @entity48 feature called @entity49 , which automatically uploads all photos taken with the iphone to their @entity14 account			1
@entity27 , it seems , was too busy having a good time to check whether or not @entity25 was activated			0
the feature can be turned off with a simple on / off switch in the phone ’s settings			2
@entity60 's night : @entity27 ( blue shirt , right ) took snaps of himself having a boys night with some friends gal pal : @entity11 identified this woman as @entity27 's girlfriend , who also appears to be pregnant angry and happy : he posted several pictures of his assumed girlfriend in an @entity73 t - shirt , displaying a breadth of emotions raise your glass : he is seen enjoying a cuppa with another crew member @entity27 took document @entity27 ’s adventures on the cruise ship			1

’ ) ms @entity11 did not immediately return @entity113 ’s request for comment			0
letting loose : @entity27 also went to what appears to be a staff birthday party , with the ship 's captain ( far right ) in attendance , she said bitter : @entity11 wrote , ' and here 's a beautiful sunset @entity27 had time to capture , all on my stolen @entity2 ' cruise - tivities : @entity27 's interests were varied , and included snapping a picture of another crew member , and one with a parrot statue @entity130 , the manager of public affairs at @entity3 , told @entity113 that the crew member in question has been placed on administrative leave			1

meanwhile , the crew member suspect is still on the wonder , but has been restricted from entering guest areas of the ship			0
@entity40 notes that there could be a large margin of error for the employee ’s culpability , including whether or not ms @entity11 reported the device missing or if he somehow purchased the phone from another person without knowing the original source .			0
