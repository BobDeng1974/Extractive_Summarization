by @entity0 for the @entity1 a @entity3 burglar who was released from prison early and deported has been caught back in @entity5 just 12 days later			1
police believe @entity7 , 32 , may have hoped to retrieve stolen jewellery he hid under floorboards			1
he was arrested at his former address in @entity11 , @entity12 , last week after being identified as a suspect in an assault			1
shocked and fearful : @entity15 , left , was robbed by @entity7 , right , who served hardly any of his prison term before being sent back to @entity3 - only to return days later police noticed the floorboards had been disturbed and discovered loot from the burglary last march beneath them			1
incredibly , @entity7 ’s accomplice in the burglary , countryman @entity24 , has twice been freed from prison early and deported – only to return to the @entity5 and continue offending			1
yesterday the men ’s victims and a local mp expressed their astonishment at the ease with which they came back			1
their most recent victim , dancer @entity15 , 26 , said : ‘ it ’s massively frustrating to learn that both people who burgled my house have been let out early and sent home , only to come straight back to @entity5			1
‘ i do n’t understand how someone can walk back into the country so easily despite being deported			0
’ the jewellery found by police has been returned to miss @entity15			1
it was a gift from her mother , who died from cancer in june			0
more items are still missing			0
@entity45 , the @entity46 mp for @entity11 , said : ‘ it is quite clear that the current system is not working			1
clearly it is good for the taxpayer if criminals are deported instead of serving in prison , but there needs to be a watch list of people who can not come back			0
’ accomplice : @entity58 was also jailed for the raid on miss @entity15 's home @entity7 and @entity58 , 27 , were jailed for a year and two years respectively in june for breaking in to the home @entity62 shares with her sister @entity64 , 24 , a shop assistant manager			1
@entity7 was deported on august 3 , less than six weeks into his sentence , under an early removal scheme intended to cut costs and free up space in prisons			1
he was arrested again on august 15			2
@entity7 has now been recalled to prison to serve out his sentence			2
he was not charged in connection with the assault investigation			0
@entity58 was originally jailed for 20 months in may 2012 after being convicted of two burglaries			0
he was arrested over another burglary the next april , and in august 2013 was sentenced to eight months in jail for that offence			2
he was again released early and deported – only to target the @entity78 ’ home seven months later			0
he remains in prison and will be considered for deportation			0
in a letter to mr @entity45 , @entity83 , the immigration and security minister , said the early removal scheme means foreigners can be released up to 270 days before the halfway point of their sentence			2
they should not return until the sentence has expired			0
he said : ‘ i have asked @entity92 to investigate how he has managed to return to the @entity5 before his sentence expiry date			0
’ @entity95 , 24 , who was burgled by @entity24 in 2012 , said : ‘ it worries me that the system allows these people to go free			2
’ a @entity100 spokesman said it has deported more than 19,000 foreign criminals since 2010			0
the spokesman said this was ‘ saving the taxpayer money , freeing up prisons and removing the opportunity for re-offending ’			0
sentimental : this solid silver necklace , which miss @entity15 's late mother gave to her , was among the loot stolen by @entity111 and @entity24			1
thankfully police were able to recover this item and return it - but not everything was found			2

@entity15 was burgled by @entity7 and an accomplice
26 - year - old dancer found them in *kitchen* in @entity11 , @entity12
both men were jailed - but @entity7 was sent back to @entity3 within weeks
three days after deportation on august 6 he arrested again in @entity11
miss @entity15 said she is ' *disappointed* ' with system and ' a bit fearful '
said poor border control like this justifies *public* ' *uproar* ' over immigration
