@entity1 ’s last - minute tap in eased the pressure on @entity3 as @entity4 finally recorded their first win of pre-season against @entity8			1
the youngster tapped home after @entity12 ’s superb solo effort had hauled the @entity4 level after goals from @entity15 and @entity16 sandwiched @entity18 ’s penalty			1
but there were still plenty of concerns for @entity3 with the start of the @entity24 season less than a week away and simmering tensions with the board and fans still brewing			2

the need for a fit striker to replace the injured @entity74 was obvious , with @entity48 floundering up top and @entity77 still some way from match fitness , and the ease with which @entity15 and @entity16 walked through the home defence for their goals was the stuff of nightmares			0
the fact @entity28 was already defending his manager in his programme notes before a @entity24 ball has even been kicked must also raise question marks			1
there were encouraging signs though , with a new 3 - 5 - 2 formation working well in the first half and new signings @entity44 , @entity37 and @entity45 – who was forced off with an injury after half an hour – all impressing , and @entity42 acclimatising well to a right wing - back role			1
it could easily have been a win too with @entity42 hitting the post late on and @entity28 curling @entity100 looked the better in the early exchanges , passing the ball out of defence with ease , but went behind on 16 minutes			2
@entity8 had threatened to expose the gap behind the @entity4 defence twice already when @entity15 outmuscled @entity40 and slotted past @entity38			0
winner : @entity1 celebrates scoring the winning goal for @entity4 against @entity8 spot on : @entity18 ( left ) celebrates scoring a penalty for @entity4 against @entity8 catch him if you can : @entity44 skips past @entity8 's @entity58 @entity48 thought he had equalised but was ruled offside when he collected @entity45 ’s scuffed shot , and @entity28 wasted a superb opportunity when unmarked on the penalty spot			1
at the other end , @entity16 should have scored but dragged his effort wide from @entity117 ’s cut - back			0
@entity44 was winning over the @entity119 crowd with an all action display , blocking a chance at one end and then coming close twice at the other – sending a half volley straight at @entity53 and then just failing to control @entity18 ’s throughball			2
@entity18 did bring the @entity4 level in first - half injury time			1
@entity45 ’s replacement @entity46 showed quick feet in the box and was brought down , with @entity18 coolly converting to the keeper ’s left			2
lots to do ? @entity3 watches on as his side came back from behind twice at @entity119 @entity47 came in for @entity37 at half time and the @entity4 switched to a more familiar 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 formation with @entity28 playing behind @entity48			1
@entity63 shot high and wide after @entity41 misjudged a long ball and @entity44 continue to impress , but his shot across goal was just too far in front of @entity48			0
@entity8 went back in front when @entity16 found himself in acres of space between @entity39 and @entity40 and finished with ease			0
@entity3 ’s men fought back though and @entity146 ’s introduction reenergised them before he got the equaliser , wriggling past three defenders before firing low in the near corner			0
the home side pushed for a winner , with @entity42 seeing his close - range shot come back off the post , before @entity1 touched home from two yards from @entity49 ’s cross to end the @entity4 ’ pre-season hoodoo and give @entity3 some much needed cheer .			1

@entity18 and @entity12 also on target for @entity4
@entity28 defended under fire @entity3 in programme notes
new signings @entity44 , @entity37 and @entity45 played
