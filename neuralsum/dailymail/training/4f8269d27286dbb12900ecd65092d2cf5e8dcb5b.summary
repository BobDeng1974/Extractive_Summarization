with the speedboat at risk of capsizing , the 18 - year - old sat on the 10 - inch wide shelf and desperately held on to it for fear of falling into the water and being dragged under the 100ft - long ferry			1
lucky escape : @entity7 in front of the @entity18 chain ferry which she had clung to for dear life to stop her being sucked under to her death after getting stuck on the outside of the vessel perilous passage : this picture shows where @entity7 ended up ( bottom right ) after stepping off her speedboat following a collision with the ferry and the narrow ledge she shuffled along before clambering through a hatch precarious : @entity7 was stuck on the 10in - wide ledge for around five minutes until a passing lifeboat managed to alert ferry staff , who opened the hatch when staff on the ferry were alerted to her plight , they opened a hatch and @entity7 carefully stood up and shuffled 30ft along the ledge that was 2ft above the water			1
after she reached safety , a passing lifeboat threw a line to speedboat owner @entity58 , who remained on board the broken - down craft , and pulled it away from danger			1
@entity7 had been on a day out in @entity62 , @entity19 , with friend @entity63 , 19 , and his dad @entity65 when the incident happened			2
@entity63 had just got off at a slipway on the @entity18 peninsula to use the toilet before the engine of the 18ft boat seized and it drifted helplessly on the current towards the ferry			0
@entity65 , 48 , told @entity7 to jump onto the ledge along the side of the @entity18 chain ferry as there was a risk the suction from it would have swallowed the boat up			1
imminent danger : her friend 's father @entity58 told @entity7 to jump onto the ledge along the side of the ferry as there was a risk the suction from it would have swallowed the speedboat up ' potentially nasty incident ' : an @entity93 spokesman said @entity7 was extremely lucky to escape because the choppy conditions that day made it far easier for her and the speedboat to be dragged under @entity7 , who is waiting to join the army , said : ' we stopped to let @entity63 off but then another boat came along and needed to get where we were			1
' we started the engine up and moved out the way but then it stopped working and the current pushed us into the side of the ferry			2
' @entity105 told me to climb onto the ferry and hold onto the side in case the boat flipped over			2
' i knew if i stayed on the boat i could have got sucked under the ferry but i was trying not to think about it otherwise i would have panicked and been in even more danger			0
' i pushed myself up onto the side and sat there and drew my knees to my chest			0
i grabbed hold of the ledge either side of me to make sure i did nâ€™t fall in			1
crisis : the collided with the @entity18 chain ferry as the larger vessel travelled across the entrance of @entity62 between @entity18 and @entity126 drama : the engine on the speedboat broke down near the wealthy @entity18 peninsula ( pictured ) which left the craft drifting on the current towards the ferry ' luckily after about five minutes an @entity93 lifeboat passed by and they got the ferry staff to open a side hatch for me			1
' i got onto my feet and turned around so my back with to the water and held onto a railing above my head and shuffled sideways until i got to the door			0
' it was a big relief when i stepped onto the right side of the ferry and i was even more pleased to see @entity105 being towed to safety			2
' @entity65 , an engineer from @entity147 , said : ' i got @entity7 out onto the side of the chain ferry because i was worried the current and suction would make the boat flip up and she would fall out			1
' it all happened so fast			0
i was just pleased that everyone was okay and came away with no injuries			0
' a spokesman for the @entity93 said : ' the boat was perilously close to the ferry			0
' it could easily have been sucked under as the conditions out in the harbour were rough and choppy			0

' the incident happened at about 6pm last friday .			0
