a lawyer who suggested convicted rapist @entity1 could be innocent has defended his views after they were removed from the website on which they were first published			1
the @entity5 of @entity7 's solicitor @entity6 , who also said the former @entity10 striker deserves a second chance even if he is guilty , detailed his views in an article posted on the association 's website			1
@entity6 's comments were removed on tuesday morning and while he insisted he had no problem with the decision , he stood by the views			2
@entity1 and his fianc√©e @entity19 , who has stood by him , near their @entity21 home last week @entity1 put a video on his website protesting his innocence and vowing to clear his name a lawyer from the @entity27 has said @entity1 is ' being treated like the @entity28 ' in an article which describes the convicted rapist 's crime as ' alleged ' he said : ' it was not taken down at my behest , but was removed with my consent and i have no difficulty with the @entity5 @entity7 's decision to do so			1
' the article reflected my opinion of the situation and did not seek to represent the views of the @entity5 @entity41 or its members			2
i stand over its contents			0
' @entity45 , general secretary of the @entity27 , confirmed that it had been the association 's decision to remove the article from the website			0
@entity45 said : ' we decided to take it down , it was our decision			0
we decided to take it down this morning as soon as we came in			0
@entity55 @entity54 ( left ) became the fourth high - profile @entity10 patron to resign over the ongoing row , while @entity59 said she would ask for her name to removed from the club 's ground if @entity1 returns the stand was re-named in @entity65 's honour after her 2012 @entity67 triumph ' the decision was not at the behest of @entity6 , it was our decision to take it down			1
' in the article , @entity6 argued that @entity1 , who was released last month after serving half of a five - year jail sentence following his conviction for the rape of a 19 - year - old woman in @entity77 , @entity78 , deserves a chance of redemption			1
the player has always maintained his innocence despite being found guilty			0
@entity6 wrote : ' this crime , as alleged , was at the bottom end			1
there was no violence and thankfully the victim has no recollection of it			0
this , i hasten to add , does not make it right , or anything close to it , but it is nonetheless a mitigating factor			0
' @entity54 's decision to quit his post follows the examples of tv 's @entity99 ( left ) and singer @entity101 businesswoman @entity102 also left her role at the @entity105 club since @entity1 returned to training he added : ' it 's not easy to muster up too much sympathy for @entity1 , but there is surely nothing worse than being accused of a crime which you genuinely believe you did n't commit			1
' the argument against that is that a jury convicted him of the crime			2
the same applied to the @entity28 and the @entity116			1
they got no public sympathy either			0
' maybe he is guilty or perhaps he 's innocent , none of us knows for sure			0
surely , either way , he deserves a chance at redemption			0
