by @entity1 reporter published : 12:44 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 16:07 est , 17 september 2013 with its looming towers and bright lights , @entity2 at night already looks like something from a fantasy world			2
but now the capital could have another addition to its skyline - a skyscraper that would n't look out of place in @entity12			0
the planned office development , which has also been likened to a giant set of books on a bookshelf and a toast rack , would comprise of 10 ' vertical slices ' ranging from seven to 34 - storeys high in @entity2 's financial district			2
the designs were unveiled today and have taken inspiration from the ' neo-gothic ' architecture featured in @entity25 's @entity24 and @entity27 's @entity26			1
the planned development is said to be influenced by buildings featured in @entity25 's @entity24 located in @entity31 in the insurance industry 's heartland , it would be 558ft ( 170 metres ) tall at its highest - 10 metres shorter than the nearby gherkin and would become the capital 's 13th highest building			1
the project is expected to cost about £ 391million			1
developer @entity38 also said it would consist of 890,000 square feet of offices and 20,000 square feet of shops			0
construction is planned to start in 2015 on the condition that it pre-lets 30 per cent of the building , with completion targeted for 2019			2
dizzy heights : the new building ( centre ) would be 558ft tall making it the capital 's 13th highest building @entity38 bought the development plot , known as the @entity53 , out of administration in 2011 for more than £ 175million			1
the value of the building once fully let could be between £ 800million and £ 1billion , property experts said			2
@entity58 , @entity38 's director of property development , said the building is ' a vote of confidence in the @entity62 and a major boost to investment , growth and employment in the economy			0
' it was designed to have a cascading shape so as not to spoil views of @entity71 from @entity72			0
inspiration : the new building would n't look out of place in @entity27 's @entity26 @entity38 's plans come amid a split in the office letting market in @entity2 's financial district with developers in the @entity82 postcode district having more success among the relatively buoyant insurance industry versus the more broadly weak state of financial services firms and banks further afield			1
the owners of the nearby @entity90 skyscraper , which attracted headlines this month after sunlight reflected off its glass cladding melting parts of a @entity96 car and even fried an egg on the pavement , said in july they expect the tower to open two - thirds full next year on the back of strong demand from insurers			0
many have said the building will liken @entity2 to @entity12 featured in @entity25 's 1989 version of @entity24 outside the insurance industry 's heartland , construction on the 100 @entity108 tower , owned by @entity111 developer @entity109 and the @entity113 skyscraper , backed by @entity116 investment manager @entity114 , has stalled amid a fruitless search for tenants			1
@entity38 will submit its plans to the @entity62 on september 23			0
it hired @entity125 's architectural practice make , the architect behind @entity128 's headquarters in the @entity62 , to design the development .			0
