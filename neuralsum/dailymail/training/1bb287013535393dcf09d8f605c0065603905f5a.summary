the names of @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 were found scrawled near the front door of @entity13 's and @entity14 in @entity15 , near @entity16 , by amateur archaeologists			1
the writing , which features their names and date , shows they left their mark on the village church in 1515 – as the country was hit by an outbreak of the bubonic plague			1
the medieval graffiti , showing the names of @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 ( pictured ) , was discovered on a wall of all @entity13 's and @entity14 in @entity15 , near @entity16 , by by amateur archaeologists the markings of @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 ( pictured with the markings coloured in ) stretch back to 1515 and have been discovered for the first time by @entity34 and @entity35 volunteers it was found hidden under lime wash which was removed by @entity34 and @entity35 volunteers			1
archaeologist @entity40 said the three girls were almost certainly children because their names have not been listed as adults in any parish records			1
other records reveal that members of their family were tenant farmers who had lived in @entity15 since at least 1279			0
centuries ago it was common for individuals to scrawl their names in churches as they were unable to afford memorials			1
mr @entity40 , who is working with a team which studies medieval graffiti , said their project had shown that church plague graffiti was far more common than previously thought			1
he said the elite and wealthy were remembered with monuments while graffiti remembered the ' common voice '			1
he said : ' the most heart - breaking inscriptions are those that refer to long - dead children			1
' this one is particularly emotive because it 's the names of three girls who all died in the same year			1
' these people often could n't afford to have themselves memorialised and in some cases this graffiti could have been the last mark of their life and that is heart - breaking			1
' although no records show how the girls died , it is believed they fell victim to the @entity80			0
one of the inscriptions discovered by @entity34 and @entity35 volunteers at the @entity16 church was a prayer , asking for @entity85 to have mercy upon the soul of an individual called ' @entity89 ' another inscription was that of a ritual protection marks – also known as witch marks - which wards off evil during their time spent uncovering the works in the church , the team also found a number of other inscriptions including ritual protection marks – also known as witch marks - which are said to ward of evil spirits			1
other inscriptions show figures of armed men and prayers to those who had fallen ill from the plague			1
the plea ' @entity85 save us ' was also found scrawled across the church in @entity111 , @entity112 , and is believed to be dated back to 1348			1
the @entity114 dr @entity113 , of all @entity13 's and @entity14 , said the discovery of the graffiti was pleasing			2
she said : ' none of us knew about the graffiti so it has added something to our local knowledge and it 's very exciting			2
' the church is full of absolutely fascinating historical details			2
it has stunning 14th century wall painting and there is a lot of graffiti chiselled in the tower - which was used by a school for years			1
' churchwarden @entity131 added that the new discovery was ' a bit mysterious ' for the church , which is open every day to visitors			2
he said : ' this is a new discovery			0
the group that came are experts who used cameras and equipment to find the graffiti			2
a lot of it is n't visible to the naked eye			0
' the project to unearth medieval graffiti was set up in 2010 and is the first attempt to survey @entity149 graffiti in churches since the late 1960s			1
pictured : an example of graffiti from @entity154 church , @entity155 @entity131 , churchwarden of @entity157 and @entity14 , and the @entity114 dr @entity113 ( together above ) said the discovery was ' exciting ' and ' adds something to the village 's local knowledge ' the 1515 outbreak of the bubonic plague started in @entity164 and quickly spread across south east @entity165			1
at the time , @entity166 suspended its classes and large gatherings of people were banned from attending public events			0
children were particularly hard - hit and their bodies were usually hastily buried in unmarked graves			2
the graffiti project was set up in 2010 and is the first attempt to survey @entity149 graffiti in churches since the late 1960s			2
volunteers use digital cameras and powerful lamps to reveal previously hidden or faded markings			0
at least 60 per cent of the 650 churches surveyed in @entity34 , @entity183 and north @entity184 have been found to contain ' significant amounts ' of graffiti and volunteers have recorded up to 500 pieces in many of them			2
the project has confirmed that most of the medieval graffiti was created during times of pestilence such as the @entity80 of 1349 and subsequent outbreaks of plagues			1
the bubonic plague is one of the most devastating diseases in history , having killed millions of people during the ' @entity80 ' in the 14th century			2
it resulted in the deaths of an estimated 75 to 200 million people in @entity205 between 1346 and 1353 and claimed thousands of other victims during the dozens of additional outbreaks later down the line			0
drawings and paintings from the @entity80 , which wiped out about a third of the @entity205 population , depict town criers shouting ' bring out your dead ' while dragging trailers piled with infected corpses through the streets			0
the plague is caused by a bacterium known as @entity220 , which uses the flea as a host and is usually transmitted to humans via rats			2
it causes grotesque symptoms such as gangrene and the appearance of large swellings on the groin , armpits or neck , known as ' buboes '			0
the bubonic plague kills up to two thirds of sufferers within just four days if it is not treated			0
however , if antibiotics are administered within 24 hours of infection , patients are highly likely to survive			0
after the @entity80 arrived in 1347 , the plague became a common phenomenon in @entity205 , with outbreaks recurring regularly until the 18th century			0
bubonic plague has now almost completely vanished from the western world , with 90 per cent of all cases now found in @entity246			0
however , there have been a few non-fatal cases in the @entity249 in recent years , while in august 2013 a 15 - year - old boy died in @entity251 after eating a groundhog infected with the disease			0
three months later , an outbreak in a @entity255 killed at least 20 people in a week			0
a year before 60 people died as a result of the infection , more than in any other country in the world			0
outbreaks in @entity263 have been rare in recent years , and most have happened in remote rural areas of the west			0
@entity263 's state broadcaster said there were 12 diagnosed cases and three deaths in the province of @entity272 in 2009 , and one in @entity273 in 2012			0
in the @entity249 between five and 15 people die every year as a result , mostly in western states .			0
