as thoughts were drifting idly towards @entity2 , out - of - work superhero twiddling thumbs and pining for @entity4 after leaving @entity5 , up popped @entity6 with another rescue goal			1
@entity6 is scoring at such a prolific rate he would eclipse even @entity2 in full flow			1
his late winner was his 14th in his last 18 games for @entity13 ’s team and completely transformed the mood of a frustrating night			1
he is a worthy heir to @entity2 ’s mask and cape			2
for 88 minutes , the @entity17 had grumbled and grown increasingly agitated as chances came and went			1
many were missed by @entity20 and supporters chanted for @entity22 to be unleashed from the bench			2

manager : @entity79 booked : @entity62 , @entity80 , @entity72 referee : @entity82 6.5 @entity83 : @entity34 attendance : 60,025 ratings by @entity86 at the @entity17 click here for all the stats , goals - including @entity6 's strike ( above ) - and heat maps from the @entity17 @entity34 performed superbly in the @entity26 goal , reaching out his giant paws to produce save upon save , the best to keep out a looping header from @entity22			1
a minute later , however , @entity34 was beaten as his defensive shield tired and made a rare mistake			2
they were down to 10 men having lost @entity62 to injury after @entity79 had used all his substitutes			2
it allowed @entity50 to collect a stray ball in the @entity26 penalty area and cut it towards @entity6 , who gleefully turned it over the line			1
it was a shame for @entity34 , who did not deserve to be beaten			2
but a triumph of sorts for @entity4 , who have won three on the bounce after losing at home to @entity114 and have kept three clean sheets with rookie goalkeeper @entity45 in the team			1
@entity13 confessed he was a little ‘ cautious ’ of declaring his problems were in the past			2
it was a relief to be stronger in defence , and he was grateful to have @entity47 back			2
but while tightening up at one end , his side seemed to lose some punch at the other , although piercing @entity26 ’s defensive shield is no mean feat. this was only the 10th goal they have conceded in 14 games			1
they are the best in the @entity43 , superbly well - drilled and committed			0
even when a first - half injury to @entity134 had forced a reshuffle , with @entity62 moving from central defence to midfield , they remained solid while dangerous on the break			0
@entity6 ( front ) tries to go past @entity26 defender @entity61 on wednesday night @entity4 midfielder @entity49 ( bottom ) perfectly times a sliding challenge on @entity26 striker @entity70 @entity142 boss @entity13 ( centre ) watches proceedings as his side seek that elusive first goal at the @entity17 @entity26 were dealt a blow midway through the first half when midfielder @entity134 ( bottom ) pulled up with a hamstring injury @entity67 ( right ) was replaced by defender @entity68 ( centre ) as @entity62 was moved into central midfield from centre back ‘ we were unlucky with the injuries , ’ said @entity79			1
‘ that gave @entity4 the motivation to carry on until the last second			1
@entity34 was outstanding but it not enough			0
that ’s the risk in football			0
a lot of players are having hamstring problems			0
when it ’s a kick maybe you can ask a player for five minutes more but it was a hamstring and you ca n’t continue as a player			2
’ it is a third game without a win for the @entity26 and the temptation is to think their bubble has burst			1
next up are @entity114 , at @entity173 ’s on monday , but @entity13 said : ‘ do n’t bury them too quickly			0
they are a good side			0
you have to count with @entity26 for the top four			1
‘ up front they are quick to come out , up front always first on the ball			0
they play in a very intelligent way			0
you always see they are a threat			0
’ having won here in the @entity185 in september , @entity26 arrived with confidence and @entity79 ’s fluent team did not take long to open up @entity4			1
@entity70 and @entity188 linked up neatly on the edge of the penalty area to create a clear chance for the @entity192 but his volley soared over			0
@entity79 claimed it was the best chance of the half , although @entity20 had already missed one just as good			0
@entity51 unzipped the defence for @entity20 who , having been restored to a central role with fit - again @entity22 resting on the bench , swept the ball wide			0
@entity4 striker @entity20 ( centre ) battled his way into the @entity26 box before firing a backheel shot towards goal unfortunately for the 23 - year - old ( centre ) he can only watch on as his strike fails to find the back of the net @entity52 was denied by @entity34 and a slip by @entity68 , soon after coming on nearly proved costly			1
@entity20 , however , was unable to convert an ambitious back - heel from a tight angle			2
@entity34 made a reflex save to deny @entity20 in stoppage time at the end of the first - half			0
@entity20 ’s glancing header from a free - kick swung in from the left by @entity6 , hit @entity62 and deflected towards goal			1
it was directly at @entity34 , but the @entity223 goalkeeper had to be quick to turn it over			0
@entity47 produced a smart block to thwart @entity70 soon after the restart and @entity227 darted clear on the right only to miss the goal by some considerable distance			0
@entity20 was soon in the thick of the action before half - time when he saw his fine header denied by man - of - the - match @entity34 @entity34 ( right ) lept up brilliantly to tip over @entity20 's effort up and over his crossbar in the first half the @entity223 international ( centre ) was brilliant throughout the match , this time denying @entity50 in the second half ( right ) @entity4 were far more direct and threatening once @entity22 was sent on for the last 25 minutes			1
@entity242 went the pressure on @entity34 ’s goal but the @entity223 keeper only increased in stature and confidence			0
he beat away a sweet volley by @entity22 at his near post and then made another splendid reaction save from @entity20 , throwing out a strong left hand and clawing the ball out			0
@entity51 fired high and @entity13 climbed to his feet as @entity4 fans roared on their side in search of a winner			1
aware that @entity259 were winning across the capital , they did not want to surrender more ground at the top of the table , but it was heading that way until @entity6 pounced			1
‘ he has such desire to fight and find something special to get the goal , ’ said @entity13			0
‘ we are in december and he only arrived in july			0
when you look at his goals and the impact he has had on the team it is tremendous			0
’ @entity274 unhappy with second half performance @entity6 ( left ) hugs captain @entity276 ( centre left ) after @entity4 's win - a result that was tough on @entity280			1

@entity6 scored in the 89th minute to give @entity4 a dramatic victory against @entity26
the @entity286 international tapped home from close range following an @entity50 pull back
result moves the @entity142 up to sixth on 23 points , while @entity26 stay in third on 26 after 14 games
