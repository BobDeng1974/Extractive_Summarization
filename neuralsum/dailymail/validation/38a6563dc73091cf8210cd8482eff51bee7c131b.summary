former @entity1 captain @entity0 is pushing his @entity3 front - row colleague @entity2 for an @entity1 call - up			1
the 30 - year - old @entity6 prop , who produced a man - of - the - match performance in the @entity10 ' 26 - 14 @entity9 win over @entity11 on friday night , has a @entity13 - born father and has put his hand up to represent @entity1			1
signed in the winter on a four - year deal from @entity17 , @entity2 has proved to be an instant hit with @entity3 and @entity0 believes he could make an impact with @entity21 's men in the test series against @entity23 in the autumn			1
@entity2 has been backed for an @entity1 jersey by former national team skipper @entity0 @entity27 , who signed with @entity3 in the winter , has a @entity13 - born father ' he 's been really good for us this year , ' @entity0 said			1
' he 's slotted straight into @entity9			0
the prop was man - of - the - match in @entity3 win over @entity11 on friday night ' he 's got a great style of football , he can play a bit			1
' @entity0 says he would not have a problem with the @entity37 - born @entity2 representing @entity1 , pointing to @entity21 's selection of @entity23 - born @entity39 for the 2013 @entity40 while predecessor @entity41 picked @entity43 - born forward @entity42 for @entity44 in 2007			1
' the bigger pool you can get for @entity1 the better , ' he added			2
' we are seeing that within all sports now with eligibility rules , so why not ? ' i ca n't speak for other players , you would have to ask them if it puts their noses out of joint but it never bothered me			0
' @entity55 ( @entity56 ) was in there , was n't he ? ' the biggest hurdle for @entity2 will be the plethora of world - class front - row forwards at @entity21 's disposal			2
@entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 and @entity66 are expected to be automatic picks after playing in the 2014 @entity68 while @entity70 duo @entity69 and @entity71 are pushing themselves into the reckoning			0
@entity37 - based @entity74 will also fancy his chances of breaking through after being a non-playing member of @entity21 's squad last year			0
@entity2 , who also played in the @entity78 for @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 , was selected for the @entity82 in 2011			0
@entity0 says @entity2 could make an immediate impact for @entity1 against @entity23 meanwhile , teenager @entity84 could be set for an extended run in the @entity3 team after marking his home debut with a try against @entity11			1
the 19 - year - old had been on stand - by for @entity1 winger @entity90 and got his chance when the former @entity93 favourite was ruled out with a serious shoulder injury			2
' @entity64 will have to have an operation so he is going to be a number of weeks out , which is a shame for him , ' @entity10 coach @entity95 said			0
' he 's been one of our best players and certainly one of the best wingers in the competition			0
' if there 's a positive it 's that it 's early in the season and he will have his rehab and come back to us at an important part of the year			0
