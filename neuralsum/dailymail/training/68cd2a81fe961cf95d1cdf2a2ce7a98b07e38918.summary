by @entity0 published : 07:10 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 08:17 est , 3 may 2013 one of @entity2 's leading scientists has hit out at @entity4 researchers who created new strains of a killer flu virus in a bid to develop vaccines			1
they claim the ' hybrid ' flu , which mixes bird flu virus with human flu , could escape the lab and lead to a global health crisis pandemic killing millions of people			2
it comes amid rising fears of a flu epidemic as @entity4 struggles to contain an outbreak of the virus			1
the @entity22 up close : researchers fear an experimental strain of the killer virus could escape from the @entity4 lab that created it fears over hybrid flu escaping led to scientists imposing a voluntary moratorium on their @entity22 research , banning transmission studies using ferrets			1
however , researchers decided to lift the ban earlier this year , arguing that they have now consulted widely with health organisations and the public over safety concerns			2
however , some scientists still oppose the work , saying any work is too dangerous and experimental strains could escape the lab. professor @entity44 , director of @entity4 ’s @entity45 at @entity46 , deliberately mixed the @entity22 bird - flu virus , which is highly lethal but not easily transmitted between people , with a 2009 strain of h1n1 flu virus , which is very infectious to humans			1
the researchers claim the work could help develop a vaccine			2
' the work of @entity58 and colleagues provides a framework for further studies examining how the structure of the avian flu virus influences how readily it could transition to being a pathogen with human pandemic potential , ' @entity54 , the journal which published the research , said			0
the study , which was carried out in a laboratory with the second highest security level to prevent accidental escape , resulted in 127 different viral hybrids between @entity22 and @entity72 , five of which were able to pass by airborne transmission between laboratory guinea pigs			0
however , it is feared the mutated viruses could escape , sparking a global pandemic			0
' they claim they are doing this to help develop vaccines and such like , ' lord may of @entity81 , a former government chief scientist and past president of the @entity84 , told @entity89			1
' in fact the real reason is that they are driven by blind ambition with no common sense whatsoever , and the record of containment in labs like this is not reassuring			1
' they are taking it upon themselves to create human - to - human transmission of very dangerous viruses			0
it ’s appallingly irresponsible , ' he said			0
it comes as experts warn human cases of a deadly new strain of bird flu that has killed 27 people in @entity4 are likely to crop up in @entity112 and around the world			1

lord may , a former @entity119 science advisor , warned the ' hybrid ' flu , which mixes bird flu virus with human flu , could escape the lab and kill millions in his first media interview since returning from an international scientific mission to @entity4 last week , professor @entity125 , the head of the influenza and respiratory viruses programme at the @entity130 ( @entity130 ) , said the @entity132 flu outbreak in humans was one that should be taken extremely seriously and watched closely			1
' we are at the start of a very long haul with @entity132 , ' @entity125 told @entity137 in a telephone interview			0
he said there were many scientific questions to be answered about the new flu strain , which was first detected in patients in @entity4 in march having been previously unknown in humans			1
the flu has so far infected at least 127 people in @entity4 and killed 27 of them , according to latest data from @entity4 health authorities and the @entity147			1
scientific studies of the virus have established it is being transmitted from birds - probably mostly chickens - to people , making it a so - called zoonotic disease that humans catch from animals rather than from other humans			0
@entity125 , who visited @entity159 and @entity160 last week with a team of international scientific experts , confirmed what the @entity147 has repeatedly said - that there is no evidence yet of the virus efficiently passing from person to person - a factor that would make @entity132 a serious pandemic flu threat if it were to evolve			1
a worker sprays disinfectant in a live poultry market in @entity172 , @entity173 , ahead of a sweeping ban on live poultry slaughter in markets that will take effect across @entity178 in two weeks @entity125 said the ' most pressing public health question ' for now was to identify the source of the circulating virus - the so - called ' reservoir ' - that is leading to chickens contracting it and sporadically passing it on to humans			0
this is likely to take time , with any results unlikely for several months			0
he said the @entity130 , which monitors disease in the @entity191 , and health authorities around the world should expect that ' imported cases ' of @entity132 flu may well begin to crop up elsewhere			0
flu experts speaking at a briefing in @entity198 on wednesday said those mutations , together with evidence that @entity132 is still mutating rapidly and probably spreading almost invisibly among birds because it does not make them obviously sick , meant this new flu was a ' serious threat ' to world health			2
' you can never predict anything about flu , but it is concerning to see those mutations there , @entity125 said			0
' that 's why it 's important @entity112 should take this very seriously			2
' @entity125 added that he thought the @entity4 were doing an ' impressive job ' handling , reporting , investigating and seeking to contain the outbreak .			2

former government chief scientist lord may *accused* @entity4 team of ' blind ambition '
researchers created strains in a bid to develop vaccines
comes as experts warn new flu strain that has killed 27 in @entity4 could spread to @entity112
