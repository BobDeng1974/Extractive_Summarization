they are not just pretty faces			0
@entity3 can learn how to make and use tools , a study found			1
the clever birds fashioned and used rakes made from pieces of wood to bring tasty morsel of foods within reach			1
what is more , they did n’t simply copy the technique			0
instead , they adapted it , so that their version was better than the original			0
this ingenuity made the bird at @entity32 the first known member of the parrot family to make tools , a feat once thought to be uniquely human @entity32 researcher @entity37 said : ' the cockatoos seem to emulate and surpass their teacher , which is what all good professors hope for from their best students			1
' an experiment by the @entity45 has proved that members of the crow family , known as corvids , are smarter than most mammals and can perform tasks that three and four - year - old children have difficulty with			0
scientists said that , while having very different brain structures , both crows and primates use a combination of mental tools , including imagination and the anticipation of possible future events , to solve similar problems			2
other experiments involving the same family of birds found that @entity67 crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food			1
a study also found that rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach			2
urban - living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts			0
two years ago , professor @entity37 told of his amazement that a cockatoo called @entity21 came up with the idea of biting a piece of wood of his aviary beam and using it to inch a piece of food within reach			1
this ingenuity made @entity21 the first known member of the parrot family to make tools , a feat once thought to be uniquely human			1
now , the professor has shown that other cockatoos can learn to make and use tools , by watching @entity21 give ‘ carpentry classes ’			1
the three other males tested - @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 - learnt to use wooden sticks – and had a technique that was superior to their teacher ’s			1
professor @entity37 said : ‘ there is a substantial difference between repeating a teacher ’s behaviour and emulating his or hers achievements while creating one ’s own methods			0
‘ the latter implies a creative process stimulated by a social interaction			0
while the former could , at least potentially , rely on simple imitation			0
’ now , three male cockatoos have learnt to use wooden sticks at @entity32 by mimicking @entity21			1
one of the three ( @entity104 pictured ) made his own stick without prompting , while a second fashioned a stick after watching @entity21 perform the same task one of the three made his own stick without prompting and a second fashioned one after watching @entity21			1
none of the females tested succeeded and they seemed less motivated than the males , the journal @entity128 reports			1
although many animals can use sticks and tools if they happen to come upon them , few physically fashion them			2
other than the cockatoos studied here , examples include @entity67 crows , which make hook - like sticks to spear insects , and chimps that use their teeth to fan out the ends of the sticks they use to catch termites			1
all of the birds tested were @entity151 ’s cockatoos			2
native to @entity154 , they are friendly birds sometimes kept as pets			0

pipin is pictured using the stick to move the food inside the cage			2

in 2012 , a cockatoo called @entity21 created a tool to help him reach food
he did it by biting a piece of wood in his aviary to inch food within reach
new research has shown other cockatoos can learn to make and use tools , by watching @entity21 give ' carpentry classes '
as a result , three other males tested learnt to make and use wooden sticks
