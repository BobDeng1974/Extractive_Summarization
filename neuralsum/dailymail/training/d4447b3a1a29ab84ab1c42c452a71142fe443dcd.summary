by @entity0 published : 16:52 est , 16 june 2012 updated : 03:36 est , 17 june 2012 @entity1 , @entity4 's first @entity3 rower , was worried that the clash of @entity6 and the @entity7 would affect his performance it was a sporting quandary with uncanny echoes of the movie @entity11			0
when @entity1 was selected for the @entity4 olympic 2012 rowing squad , he was naturally delighted – but his joy quickly faded when he realised he might not be able to compete properly because of his religious convictions			1
unfortunately for @entity1 – @entity4 ’s first @entity7 fall during @entity6 , when @entity17 may not eat or drink in daylight hours			1
@entity1 , the son of a @entity20 father and @entity22 mother , knew that failing to eat properly would badly affect his performance in the men ’s eight , so considered postponing his fast			1
but an imam he consulted warned that for each of the 30 days of @entity6 that he transgressed the rules he would incur an entire month of fasting later on			1
‘ that could have meant years of not eating between sunrise and sunset , ’ @entity1 , 24 , told @entity29			1
desperate to find another solution , he then heard about @entity20 goalkeeper @entity35 , who though a @entity3 never fasted during his time at @entity37 in @entity39 ’s @entity38			1
instead , he would go to @entity40 each year to pay for thousands of meals for the poor			1
a cousin in @entity44 , the home town of @entity1 ’s father , consulted scholars to come up with the final answer			2
@entity1 would follow the example of @entity49 and provide 60 meals for the poor for each day he misses the fast			1
so this summer , up to 1,800 people in @entity40 will eat a meal thanks to a 6ft 8in rower chasing a gold medal in the @entity4			0
he will pay for the food by donating £ 1,000 to a @entity4 charity , @entity59 ( ‘ nothing for us ’ ) , which helps homeless children in @entity40 , and giving a further £ 1,000 to the poor via his family			1
‘ @entity64 says you must fast unless you have “ due cause ”			0
the way i see it , i have a cause , which is the @entity71 , ’ @entity1 said			0
@entity1 is looking to tackle the issue by providing meals for 1,800 people ' a few people have mentioned the comparison with @entity11			2
it was a tough decision			0
' i wanted to pay my dues in full and i ’m very fortunate that i can			2
' the 1981 film @entity11 told the story of runner @entity81 at the @entity82			0
the devout @entity83 refused to run a heat in his best event , the 100 metres , because it was on a sunday , but then ran the 400 metres in world record time to win gold			0
@entity1 is one of an estimated 3,000 @entity3 athletes at the @entity7 who will cope with @entity6 in a variety of ways			0
special provision has been made in the @entity94 for those who fast , including pre-dawn breakfasts			0
all competition venues will also provide a meal immediately after sunset			0
@entity11 : @entity1 's story has been likened to the 1981 film about @entity83 runner @entity81 at the @entity82 who refused to run on a sunday but then ran 400 metres in world record time and won gold he said : ‘ the decision i ’ve made is the right one for me , but there will be athletes who are fasting and others who postpone their fast , or do what i ’m doing , but everyone ’s making their own decision for themselves			2
’ brought up in @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity1 was spotted by a @entity116 scouting programme visiting his comprehensive school when he was 15 years old			0
going on to study sports science at @entity119 , @entity120 , he fasted for a month in 2010 to investigate the results while still training			2
‘ i normally weigh about 16½ stone but during fasting i stuffed my face at 4am trying to eat enough to get through the day			1
by nightfall , i weighed 11lb less than in the morning			0
’ @entity35 , who played in goal for @entity40 ( left ) and also managed the national team ( right ) , never observed @entity6 while playing in @entity39 , instead choosing to feed the poor in his homeland			1

religious rules prevent him eating and drinking in daylight hours
@entity134 warned him that for each day he transgressed the rules he would incur an entire month of fasting
now he plans to emulate @entity20 goalkeeper @entity35 who would go to to his home country each year to pay for thousands of meals for the poor
