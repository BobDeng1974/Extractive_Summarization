@entity1 's once - stratospheric presidential poll numbers have begun their inevitable slide down to earth , and the leader of the ' @entity5 ' draft movement conceded thursday that she 's not as inspiring a candidate as president @entity7 once was			1
former @entity7 2012 battleground states director @entity8 hinted thursday that he 'll have trouble getting as excited about a @entity11 effort			2
' well , you fall in love once , right ? ' he said thursday in a videotaped interview			0
' 2008 was a magical time			0
@entity8 still refers to a @entity1 run for the @entity35 as a ' potential ' campaign , even though his group has raised more than $ 6 million from 55,000 - plus contributors since its january 2013 launch			1
there has been no public discussion about whether the donors would feel baited - and - switched if their campaign cash ended up supporting vice president @entity44 , @entity46 senator @entity45 , hud secretary @entity47 , @entity49 sen. @entity48 , @entity51 gov. @entity50 or any of the other @entity27 hopefuls who have tested the waters in public or behind the scenes with fundraisers			1
' i 'm not in love , no no , ' a mocking @entity58 , executive director of the right - leaning @entity59 , taunted @entity8 on thursday			0
\ ' " i 'm supporting her just because " is n't exactly an inspiring campaign anthem			2
' ' her strategists ' quote encapsulates a summer where the promise of @entity1 's campaign has been met with the cold , hard reality of what is sure to be a dreary slog to 2016 , ' @entity58 said			1
his quick - punching message group ridiculed @entity27 on its website after @entity8 's remarks hit the @entity74 , saying that while their 2008 slogans were ' change you can believe in ' and ' @entity79 , ' the 2016 equivalent would be ' meh , i guess she ’s our best shot			1
' @entity83 's sense of inevitability has taken a tumble since she claimed , while promoting her slow - selling memoir , that she and former president @entity83 were ' dead broke ' when they left the @entity35 in 2001			1
pundits contrasted that claim with the @entity92 ' wealth , massive speaking fees and high - flying lifestyle , turning an offhand comment into a national gaffe story			2
the perception that the former secretary of state is tone - deaf has taken its toll			0
a @entity103 - @entity102 poll released on thursday shows her once robust edge against likely @entity106 front - runners is thinning			2
' you only fall in love once ' : @entity8 was a fixture in @entity7 's two presidential campaigns but now finds himself promoting a less charismatic candidate against former @entity114 gov. @entity113 , she had a 55 - 39 lead in april polling , a margin of 16 points			1
that has shrunk just seven at 48 - 41			0
the 21 - point chasm between @entity83 and @entity46 gov. @entity121 , measured in february , is now just 6 points , a 47 - 41 edge that shows how soft her support has become			1
for the first time , in fact , @entity83 fails to crack the 50 per cent threshold in hypothetical contests against any @entity106 challenger			2
her ' misstatements , starting with " we left the @entity35 broke , " are n't headline grabbers , but they 're noticeable , ' said @entity136 , director of the @entity137 in @entity138			0
' with @entity1 , there 's no preseason , ' he added			1
' she needs a @entity142 - like performance from start to finish			0
' no one in the @entity106 has emerged as a pack - leader			0
the @entity102 poll shows @entity113 and @entity121 tied at the top of a 10 - person field with 13 per cent support			0
the ' undecided ' category still beats all comers , with 24 per cent .			0

*conservative* @entity31 says @entity27 will *replace* ' @entity79 ' slogan in 2016 with ' meh , i guess she ’s our best shot '
