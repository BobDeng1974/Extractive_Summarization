nervous : @entity1 is one of the @entity3 ultra-rich who could move if the country leaves the @entity5 a vote for @entity3 independence could see the country 's millionaires flee to @entity10 , with one in seven of ultra-rich @entity3 likely to leave , according to a report released today			1
experts warn of uncertainty over the tax regime and financial stability in an independent @entity3 , which could push the rich out of the country in the event of a @entity20 vote in thursday 's referendum			1
in addition , many of @entity3 's wealthiest people run businesses based south of the border , meaning they are more likely to move to @entity10 if their fellow voters opt to leave the @entity5			1
one example is @entity1 , founder of bra firm @entity29 , who has vowed to move her company headquarters to @entity10 if the @entity31 breaks up and claims to be ' very very scared ' at the prospect of independence			2
the revelations came in a report compiled by @entity37 's magazine and consultancy firm wealthinsight on the possible impact of a @entity20 vote on the 22,000 millionaires who live in @entity3			1
around 15 per cent of the wealthiest @entity3 , with a total net worth of £ 8billion , have their primary business in @entity10 , according to the data			1
the report claims that these people are particularly likely to leave @entity3 because of the difficulties of being based in a different country to their companies			1
in addition , the uncertainty about issues such as the currency and future tax rates are set to prompt millionaires to seek the security of the @entity5 , the report suggests			1
@entity58 , editor of @entity37 ’s , said : ' if there ’s one thing the wealthy – or indeed most people – hate , it ’s uncertainty , not least over the laws and taxes which govern them			0
' in the long , obscure and painful period between a @entity20 vote and eventual independence , wealthy @entity3 – and particularly those with business interests in @entity10 – might well hop the border to @entity10 , with its long - settled , reasonably advantageous tax system			1
' that ’s even before we learn what the @entity3 rates of tax would be , which would almost certainly be higher to pay for generous health , education and welfare provision			2
' a yes vote would therefore not only be hostile to many within @entity3 ’s wealthy community , but could affect the fortunes of its future entrepreneurs			0
' a newly independent @entity3 would put many wealthy business owners in an awkward position where they no longer live in the same country as their company			2
millionaires across @entity3 may suddenly have to choose in which country to declare their domicile and where to keep their millions			2
' estate agents have warned that the uncertainty caused by @entity3 independence would be devastating for the high - end property market - one said yesterday that £ 5million worth of deals would fall through in the event of a @entity20 vote on thursday			0
clash : @entity118 is in @entity119 today attempting to combat the arguments of @entity121 a @entity123 law firm warned today that investors would shy away from putting money into @entity3 infrastructure projects if the country voted for independence , because public - private partnerships would no longer be backed by the @entity130			0
@entity131 said : ' for some time foreign investors have been delaying investments in @entity135 projects in @entity3 because they are worried about having the implied guarantee of the @entity130 replaced with the much smaller and potentially weaker @entity3 balance sheets			0
' delays in getting investments from overseas investors into @entity3 infrastructure projects are only going to get longer if @entity3 decides to vote " yes "			0
' a string of high - profile businesses and entrepreneurs , from @entity142 to sir @entity143 , have warned of the economic instability from which an independent @entity3 could suffer			0
however , the @entity20 campaign insists that @entity3 would be one of the world 's wealthiest countries , and claims the support of 3,000 @entity3 businessmen .			0

report by consultancy suggests 15 *%* of ultra-rich could leave @entity3
