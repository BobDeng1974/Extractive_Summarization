by @entity1 reporter published : 14:44 est , 5 september 2012 updated : 14:45 est , 5 september 2012 for thousands of years , people have gazed at the night sky and found things they can relate to their lives on earth			2
where the ancient @entity8 saw mythological characters in the stars though , today ’s scientists have spotted something a little less glamorous			0
astronomers have discovered a molecular cloud , formations in space known as the nursery of an unborn star , which they say looks like a pig ’s tail			1
the giant ' pigs tail ' cloud spotted 30,000 light years from earth the @entity28 research team found two giant molecular clouds 30,000 light years from our @entity30 which they believe collided and formed the peculiar shape			1
and , spotting the twist in its tail , they gave the gas cloud an equally peculiar name			1
while the clouds often collide , few have been seen to do so with the spectacular consequences found by @entity42 , a second year @entity44 candidate , and @entity45 , an associate professor , the research team from the @entity47 at @entity48			2
they said they believe a magnetic tube was formed between the two giant molecular clouds , which is ' twisted and squeezed to become a helical structure during the frictional contact '			2
their research suggested that the molecular gas is captured by the twisted magnetic tube , forming the distinctive ' pigtail ' shape			1
researchers believe the galaxy was formed between the two giant molecular clouds , which is twisted and squeezed to become a helical structure			0
our @entity62 has a high quantity of the molecular gas which forms stars within a 600 light year radius from its centre			0
those clouds become increasingly dense and orbit the @entity62 ’s nucleus			0
at the distance that these two are found , there are two closed elliptical orbits clouds travel along and , at one of the two intersections , molecular clouds often collide			0
the huge gas formations can eventually give birth to new stars as they become denser			1
the gas is compressed even more when clouds collide with each other , meaning the strange shape observed by the scientists manning the @entity88 45m telescope at the @entity89 ( @entity90 ) in the @entity90 – which measures around 60 light years by 60 light years - could one day become a star itself			1
mr @entity42 said : ' in order to solve the mystery of the pigtail molecular cloud , we carried out high - resolution spectroscopic observations of rotational spectral lines for six other molecules			0
' those molecules are clues to understanding the physical state			0
' we were amazed by the clear and beautiful helical structure of the ‘ pigtail ’ molecular cloud in the data taken by the follow - up observation			0
' the data revealed that the pigtail molecular cloud has a huge volume of gas , several hundreds of thousands times greater than the @entity112 has			1

astronomers believe unique twisting shape was created when two clouds collided
@entity119 cloud has a huge volume of gas , several hundreds of thousands times greater than the @entity112
