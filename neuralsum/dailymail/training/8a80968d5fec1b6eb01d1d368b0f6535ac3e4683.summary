on the same day , an independent audit of @entity3 's banks will reveal how much money @entity29 will need from a £ 79billion aid package that @entity26 has already approved for the banks			1
there are also media reports that the @entity79 is reluctant to lend more to @entity28 without a new debt restructuring plan , and that @entity81 is getting cold feet about offering @entity83 a much - needed loan			2
@entity85 , head of credit strategy at @entity87 , said political rhetoric from all sides - @entity90 , @entity79 , @entity3 politicians and the @entity92 - was being ramped up ahead of the @entity3 budget tomorrow and banking sector recapitalisation report on friday			1

it 's pulling hard against the seams right now			0

' images of tear gas and rioting protesters on tv screens do n't generally engender confidence in investors that @entity131 leaders have control of the situation in @entity26			1
' prime minister @entity35 today suggested in an interview that he would make the move to ask for the bailout if debt financing costs remained too high for too long			1
