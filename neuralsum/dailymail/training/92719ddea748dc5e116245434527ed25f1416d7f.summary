@entity0 has told @entity2 fans to lay off @entity3 and believes they should be grateful for all he has done at the club			1
the @entity7 boss insists that only sir @entity8 has achieved more in the @entity10 era because @entity12 manager @entity11 ‘ has n’t done enough yet ’			1
@entity0 goes so far as to say that the @entity13 should be renamed in honour of @entity3			1
@entity3 has been in charge of @entity2 since 1996 , leading the club to multiple trophies and titles @entity3 endured dog 's abuse at @entity22 station following the @entity10 defeat last weekend the @entity2 boss is under increasing pressure after he was abused by his own supporters at a railway station following last weekend ’s 3 - 2 defeat at @entity22 , a result that left @entity2 sixth in the table and 13 points behind leaders @entity12			1
but @entity0 , who faces @entity3 in saturdays tea - time kick - off , said : ‘ the incident at the train station was totally disrespectful			1
i think 99 per cent of @entity2 fans would have been ashamed of that and we could get the backlash of it			1
they will want to show how much they love him			0
‘ that stadium should be named after him			0
the job he did in that move across ( from @entity47 ) , when they had all that debt and he had to be very careful with the transfer budget — it was a miracle that he kept them in the @entity52			0
‘ i think everyone at @entity2 knows he ’s done a magnificent job			2
for me , he ’s the second best manager in @entity10 history ( behind sir @entity8 )			1
@entity11 ( @entity11 ) has n’t done enough yet			2
’ @entity0 suggested that the club should rename the @entity13 in honour of their longest - serving boss @entity0 said @entity3 is the second best manager in @entity10 history - better than the @entity59 the incomparable sir @entity8 takes the title as the best boss , according to the @entity7 manager @entity3 has found an unlikely ally in @entity0 , the man he once shoved in a heated touchline fracas			1
they clashed at @entity66 in 2006 when @entity0 ’s @entity67 scored a late winner against the @entity69 , but the pair are now the longest - serving bosses in the top flight			1
and @entity0 added : ‘ i ’ve had one run - in with @entity3 , but otherwise he ’s been fantastic			2
i have nothing but respect for him and i ’ve always enjoyed watching his teams			0
’ @entity2 and @entity7 are only separated by goal difference and an away victory would intensify the scrutiny on @entity3 and his position , despite them making it through to the @entity52 knockout stages for the 15th consecutive season after tuesday ’s 4 - 1 win at @entity85			2
but @entity0 , who survived calls for his own sacking earlier in the season , admitted : ‘ @entity3 knows that instant results are massive , even for someone who has been in the position as long as he has			2
all of us managers are on a six - game , seven - game period with the media and social media			0
we have to accept that			0
’ @entity3 and @entity0 clashed on the touchlines while the former was boss at the @entity66 in 2006 the pair shake hands a year later during a frosty moment with @entity0 now managing @entity104 over time , it looks like the duo have grown rather fond of one another as this picture , taken in april , shows @entity0 , though , hopes @entity3 was cheered by @entity7 ’s 2 - 1 victory over @entity11 ’s @entity12 , meaning @entity2 ’s unbeaten ‘ @entity113 ’ tag from the 2003 - 2004 campaign remains intact at least for another season			1
‘ i imagine @entity3 might have had a glass of wine after that game , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ when you have that tag you do n’t want to lose it to anyone			0
‘ but we can only worry about us , it was a tremendous performance against @entity12 and the players can be proud			0
‘ we ’re on a good run but this is a difficult one because @entity2 away has not been a happy hunting ground for us			0
they have given us a thumping and on one occasion it was an embarrassing scoreline ( 7 - 3 , in 2012 )			0
‘ the games at our place have been a lot closer and we hope this one is a lot tighter as well			0

@entity7 boss @entity0 says @entity3 is the second best manager in @entity10 history

@entity0 was *shocked* at the abuse @entity3 received from *furious* fans at @entity22 station after @entity2 's loss at the @entity144
' the incident at the train station was totally disrespectful . i think 99 per cent of @entity2 fans would have been ashamed of that , ' he said
