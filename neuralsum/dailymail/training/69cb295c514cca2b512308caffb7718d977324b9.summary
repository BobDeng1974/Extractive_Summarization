state capitols across the country will be more @entity2 than at any point since the @entity5 ' 20s when victorious legislators and governors take office next year			1
that could result in lower taxes and perhaps fewer dollars flowing to social safety net programs			0
a day after a big election , newly emboldened @entity2 state leaders already were making plans wednesday to pursue deeper tax cuts , relax business regulations , expand private school vouchers and impose new limits on public welfare programs			1
in some states , such as @entity21 , @entity2 will be able to do as they want , because they control both chambers of the legislature and the governor 's office			2
in others , such as neighboring @entity28 , the @entity2 ' legislative supermajorities will be so large that they can essentially disregard the objections of a @entity31 governor			1
in this photo taken on tuesday , nov. 4 , 2014 , @entity2 @entity33 ( left ) celebrates his victory in the state @entity37 race at the @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40 , by making confetti out of negative ads and tossing them in to the air elsewhere , like in @entity46 , the @entity2 takeover of one legislative chamber simply means a stronger say in a state still otherwise led by @entity31			1
nowhere in the entire nation did @entity31 take over a legislative chamber previously held by @entity2			1
and @entity40 gov. @entity51 was the only @entity2 chief executive to fall to a @entity31 challenger			1
for statehouse @entity2 , ' it 's their strongest position in nearly a century , ' said @entity55 , an analyst at the @entity56			1
republicans will have full control of at least 29 state legislatures , according to the conference , the party 's largest total since 1928 , perhaps earlier			1
the @entity2 will hold at least 32 governorships , including newly won offices in traditionally @entity31 @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			2
in many cases , the @entity2 victories expanded majorities won in previous elections , such as the 2010 @entity2 sweep			2
over the past several years , @entity2 already have used those majorities to cut taxes , restrict abortions , expand gun rights and limit the powers of public employee unions			0
those all remain high on the @entity2 agenda			0
' we 're going to focus on legislation that helps small businesses , whether that 's taxes , labor or the regulatory environment , ' said @entity87 speaker - nominee @entity86 , whose @entity2 caucus now holds its highest - ever number of seats			1
the challenge for @entity2 may be to constrain their enthusiasm , lest they go further than some voters had anticipated and complicate their chances of re-election in the future			0
after large @entity2 majorities in @entity21 enacted widespread income tax cuts in recent years , the resulting budget difficulties turned tuesday 's election into a referendum on @entity103 gov. @entity103 's financial policies			1
he narrowly won , as @entity2 added to their ranks in the @entity87			0
@entity103 acknowledged at a victory party that ' it 's a difficult time for many @entity21 families ' and ' jobs are scarce , ' but he pledged to keep the state on the route he had charted			0
' our way is holding down taxes , holding down regulations , controlling spending , ' @entity103 said			0
@entity2 governors or legislative leaders in @entity66 , @entity119 , @entity46 , @entity120 and @entity121 also are already talking of tax cuts			1
@entity2 @entity123 , left , kisses his wife , @entity124 , after defeating rep. @entity125 in the 13th district of the @entity127 , tuesday , nov. 4 , 2014 , in @entity128 , @entity129 at right is their daughter @entity131 @entity120 gov. - elect @entity132 has promised to make an expansion of school vouchers and charter schools a priority for his new @entity2 administration that will be paired with an even larger @entity2 majority in the @entity87 and @entity139			0
@entity141 gov. @entity140 , who won re-election along with an expanded @entity2 legislative majority , also wants to expand enrollment in a private school voucher program			0
his agenda includes drug tests for people seeking food stamps or unemployment benefits and more tax cuts on top of the $ 2 billion enacted during his first term			2
in @entity119 , assistant @entity155 senate leader @entity155 said that the new @entity2 - led @entity139 hopes to team with a @entity2 governor to implement ' sensible ' changes to welfare programs , cut government spending , lower taxes and eliminate bureaucracy for businesses			2
the @entity2 victory in @entity164 was the largest since @entity165 , with @entity2 candidates sweeping the statewide offices and building upon its legislative majorities			2
republicans will have to decide whether to continue a program enacted under @entity31 gov. @entity172 that expanded health coverage to more than 200,000 people by using @entity177 money to buy private insurance			0
' with these victories by the new republicans — many of whom have voiced opposition to that — it really puts it in some real danger , ' said @entity188 , a political science professor at @entity189 in @entity190 , @entity164			0
' the big test initially is what happens to the private option			0

some majorities are so large that @entity2 state *lawmakers* can ignore objections from @entity31 governors
@entity56 says that for statehouse @entity2 , ' it 's their strongest position in nearly a century '
most state legislatures led by the @entity2 are expected to pass sweeping tax cuts that they say will *unshackle* small businesses and create jobs
