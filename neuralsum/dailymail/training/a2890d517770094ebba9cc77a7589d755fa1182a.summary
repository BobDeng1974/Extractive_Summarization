men across the country will be sporting a colourful look on their fingernails for the first two weeks of september as the the @entity5 campaign kicks off to raise awareness of violence against children			1
participants , who will wear nail polish on one of their fingers , include @entity14 player @entity13 , @entity16 winner @entity15 from @entity17 , @entity19 winner @entity18 and @entity22 's @entity21 ' @entity20			1
@entity15 , who began to show his support a little earlier than required , told @entity24 : ' i 'm already sporting a nice kind of pink with blue sparkles on top '			0
' the campaign is largely focused on getting men to participate as approximately 90 per cent of all violence committed against children is perpetrated by men			1
as a result , the campaign aims to encourage men to challenge their mates on ' what it means to be a man ' and to not accept violence , as well as painting one fingernail to represent the one - in - five children globally who experience violence			1
the idea sprung from the founder and ceo of social change advocacy group @entity64 , @entity65 , who met 10 - year - old @entity67 while in @entity68 , @entity69 last year			0
the idea sprung from the founder and ceo of social change advocacy group @entity64 , @entity65 ( left ) who met 10 - year - old @entity67 ( right ) while in @entity69 last year @entity67 was rescued from a safe house by @entity74 after suffering from abuse there			0
she and @entity65 ( right ) became friends during his stay and before he left she painted his nails ( left ) @entity67 suffered physical and sexual abuse at the hands of a paedophile for two years while at a ' safe house ' where she was taken after her father passed away			0
she was eventually rescued by @entity74 and upon meeting mr @entity65 who was working alongside the organisation , built a strong relationship with him			0
the inspiration for the @entity89 campaign came the day before @entity65 left @entity69 , when @entity67 drew a love heart on his hand and painted his fingernails			0
@entity15 revealed that his decision to become an ambassador for the campaign came from his exposure to similar experiences			2
the campaign asks men to paint one fingernail to represent the one - in - five children globally who experience violence ' i 've done charity work in @entity104 for @entity105 and i 've also worked in the slums of @entity107 in @entity108 for @entity109 , so i 've done work for children over there and seen quite in depth some of the experiences they 've been through , ' @entity15 said			1
' more importantly it 's in our own backyard and basically one in 29 children , or one kid in every class is being abused and we might not be aware of it or know it			1
' what 's important is to raise more awareness and encourage more conversations amongst ourselves , to bring the subject more light			1
' the mechanics and salesmen at @entity127 in @entity128 have also decided to take part in the charity event the workers held a barbecue for staff and clients to raise money and will have their nails painted for the fortnight one group of men who are proud to be displaying their colourful fingernails over the next fortnight are the mechanics from @entity127 in @entity128			2
the @entity143 , @entity144 , told @entity24 that everyone from the salesmen to the tow - truck drivers have painted their nails bright pink and purple			0
' @entity154 the tow - truck driver came up with the idea to get involved and it just snowballed from there and everyone got involved - the salesmen , all the service staff , the whole dealership got behind it , ' he said			0
in @entity159 , one in 29 children - or one child in ever classroom - experiences some form of abuse the campaign is largely focused on getting men to participate as approximately 90 per cent of all violence committed against children is perpetrated by men ' they are all young fellas and they just want to say not to that sort of behaviour			1
' the @entity173 kicked off the event by throwing a barbecue for staff and clients in which the proceeds were donated to the charity			0
' i think once they started to do it everyone was egging each other on and they seemed to enjoy it actually , i 'm a bit worried , ' mr @entity144 jested			0
funds raised during the @entity189 campaign will contribute to preventative measures to address violence against children he added : ' i was serving on the front counter and i 've only got one nail done and someone noticed and said " did you bruise it ? " ' i tell them the reason why and they get involved			1
it becomes a focus and talking point for people and it has certainly boosted the awareness around people so far because they 've asked a lot of questions			2
' funds raised during the @entity209 campaign will contribute to preventative measures to address violence against children .			2
