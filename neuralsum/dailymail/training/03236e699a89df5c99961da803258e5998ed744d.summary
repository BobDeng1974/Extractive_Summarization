by @entity0 a rare bee thought to be extinct in the @entity2 since 1946 has been rediscovered in @entity3 by a wildlife photographer			1
@entity5 , 66 , was in @entity6 when he unknowingly spotted a female @entity8 bee carrying pollen			1
but although mr @entity5 was drawn to the striking grey - haired insect because of its colour , he had no idea it was so rare			1
the unique @entity16 bee , commonly known as the mining bee , was last spotted on @entity2 soil 68 years ago - but has now been spotted by wildlife photographer @entity5 off the @entity3 coast mr @entity5 , 66 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , was immediately drawn towards the bee , but had no idea it was so rare until he showed the photo to his friend @entity26 , a bee expert it was only when mr @entity5 showed the photo to his close friend @entity26 , a bee expert , that the true identity of the bee was revealed			1
unbeknown to mr @entity5 , the bee had last been seen on @entity2 soil 68 years earlier and was even considered by experts to be extinct			1
mr @entity5 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , was over the moon when he realised he had spotted an incredibly rare species			1
he said : ' i had no idea it was so rare , but it turns out it has not been since in the @entity2 since 1946			2
' i 'm not a bee expert , but my close friend @entity26 is and when i showed him the picture he said : ' you 've hit the jackpot , mate ! ' ' he explained that this bee was declared extinct in the @entity2 68 years ago and that he could n't believe it was back in @entity49			1
the keen photographer spotted the distinctively grey - haired insect carrying pollen before burying it underground the bee , which is more regularly seen across the @entity54 in @entity55 , is only one - and - a - half centimetres long mr @entity5 wanted to call the bee by an easier name so has named it the grey - backed mining bee the bees that populate @entity2 today were mostly introduced from abroad - including the popular honeybee			1
in total , there are around 250 species of bees in the @entity2			0
these include 25 species of bumblebees , around 225 species of solitary bee and just a single honeybee species			2
although bees are not a protected species , they are incredibly important to the @entity2			0
they pollinate fruit and vegetable plants - making them worth £ 560m a year to the @entity2 economy			0
they are a critical part of the food chain because flowering plants depend on insects for pollination			0
the honeybee is the most effective			0
nationally , seven of the @entity2 ’s 25 native bumblebee species are in decline			0
two have become extinct , including the short - haired bumblebee			1
but sightings of rare bees , including the ruderal bumblebee , the red shanked carder bee , the moss carder bee and the brown - banded carder bee , have increased			2
' it was very exciting when he told me how rare the bee is and when i realised i could be the only person with a clear picture of it , i was thrilled			2
' mr @entity5 , who has been a wildlife photographer since the late 1970s , said the bee 's return was probably due to global warming			2
he said the energetic insect had most likely flown across the @entity54 from @entity55 , where it is more regularly seen			0
he said : ' it is called the @entity16 , but i wanted to call it something easier to understand so i 've named it the ' grey - backed mining bee '			1
' hopefully this common name will make it easier for children to understand so they can get involved and interested in nature			0
' because it is a mining bee , the female was flying around to gather pollen before burying it underground			1
' it has a grey back , and looks like a small bumble bee , but it is only one - and - a - half centimetres long			2
' anyone who has knowledge of bees would have been able to tell it was something completely different and incredibly rare			0
' bees are a critical part of the food chain because flowering plants depend on insects for pollination			0
the honeybee is the most effective			0
it pollinates 90 commercial crops worldwide , including most fruit and vegetables , alfalfa for cattle feed , nuts and cotton .			0
