@entity0 gyrating on - screen , @entity3 's childish antics and @entity5 's incoherent political ramblings have been chosen as the most irritating things of the year			2
the tiresome stars , whose performances have been endlessly documented , were singled out by 1,000 people asked to list the things that have annoyed them most in 2013			1
they are joined by figures including @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 in a list highlighting individual events - such as the birth of @entity18 , or @entity12 and @entity20 's own baby saga - as well as consistently irritating individuals such as mr @entity5			1
@entity22 : @entity3 , left , was the figure most people said had annoyed them in 2013 , while @entity5 , right , annoyed people with his entry into the political arena had enough : 35 per cent of people singled out @entity0 as somebody who has annoyed them in the past year @entity3 , whose questionable highlights this year included spitting on fans and abandoning his pet monkey , came top of the poll , with 36 per cent of people saying he annoyed them			1
miss @entity0 , whose ' twerking ' performance with @entity38 at the @entity40 awards was widely condemned , came a close second , with 35 per cent of people objecting to her , according to the survey commissioned ask jeeves			2
@entity5 , who this year entered the political arena , calling for revolution and making appearances on @entity49 and @entity50 , drew the ire of 28 per cent of those asked			2
other people to get on the nerves of the @entity56 public over the past 12 months , and probably for some time before then too , include @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity14 - all of whom have a very active presence on social media			1
however , while most of the issues on the lists were to do with celebrities , the single most annoying issue was the ongoing furore over energy prices , which has seen endless political posturing alongside painful price hikes of as much as 10 per cent			0
baby fatigue : large numbers of people were irked by the high - profile pregnancies of @entity12 , left , and the @entity75 , right , pictured with babies @entity76 and @entity18 respectively this was followed by the fuss over the twerking phenomenon , with @entity82 selfies and the rise of the onesie close behind			1
but drawn out baby sagas also annoyed @entity56 , from @entity87 ’s prospective fatherhood to the royal baby announcement to the birth of @entity76 to @entity12 and @entity20			1
with so much going on that made @entity91 feel either wound up or fed up , perhaps it is no surprise that 54 per cent said this year would be remembered as ‘ average ’			0
noisy : celebrities who have a very active presence on social media , such as @entity14 , left , and @entity97 , right , featured prominently on the list a spokesman for ask jeeves said : ' there seems to have been plenty that got on our nerves this year from pop stars to politics			1
' perhaps it is because things seem flat after we had the @entity110 and @entity111 in previous years that we found so many aspects of 2013 to be really annoying			2
' the rise of social media also means that no matter how hard one tries to avoid @entity3 or the news of @entity87 ’s impending fatherhood , it is simply not possible			0
@entity87 ' becoming a dad'4			0
arguments over the ' @entity132			0
the rise of the onesie7			0
