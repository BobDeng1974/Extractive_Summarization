with @entity1 rolling back the years against @entity2 on saturday to help @entity3 to a 3 - 2 win in the @entity6 fourth round , there has been no shortage of plaudits for the @entity10 midfielder			1
certainly , the 34 - year - old has proven himself to be one of @entity14 's most successful signings since joining from @entity15 in 2006			2
we asked @entity18 blogger @entity17 to give us the rundown on how @entity1 has won over so many fans ' hearts and etched himself into @entity23 ' folklore			2
@entity1 is proving his worth to the @entity3 cause and deserves a contract extension at the club @entity1 put in a man of the match performance as @entity3 beat @entity2 3 - 2 in the @entity6 fourth - round after the @entity3 and @entity30 star @entity1 put in a fantastic creative performance at the heart of midfield , which rightly earned him the @entity35 award , @entity14 was quick to heap praise on the 34 - year old			1
the @entity37 said , ' he was wonderful			0
a player we all love			0
if you love football , you love @entity1			2
on top of that he 's a fantastic character , scored and i 'm very pleased for him			2
' and this just highlights what the @entity3 fans have known for a long time , that @entity1 embodies the manager 's football philosophy			1
the way that @entity1 plays the game , with superb technical ability and the drive and attacking intent to go with it , is what we want to see from the @entity23			0
the way he can control and set the tempo of the game , as well as some of the outrageous bits of skill he produces is the reason why the fans call him ` little @entity64 `			0
some people do not seem to appreciate his talents quite as much , as @entity67 showed by calling his reverse passes against @entity2 ` disrespectful `			2
@entity67 later claimed that his comments were tongue in cheek , but i for one do n't buy it			0
some people still seem to want football to return to the days of heavy leather boots and ball on muddy pitches , with defenders allowed to get away with @entity81 to stop these uppity skillful players making fools of them			0
@entity3 fans , however , and most modern football fans , appreciate special talents and @entity1 has certainly been one of them			1
he may not weigh in with lots of goals for the @entity23 , but he has blessed us with some special and important ones and he is one of those players that is worth the ticket price alone			0
one of the longest serving @entity23 , @entity1 embodies the way that @entity3 want to play the game , with panache and with entertainment a close second to results			1
he scored with a well taken volley to give help restore @entity3 's two goal cushion in the second - half @entity1 joined @entity3 from @entity104 in 2006 and has since made 235 appearances for the club his superb goal yesterday , giving the @entity2 defenders ` the eyes ` and effortlessly volleying in the return pass from @entity109 was special but his goal against @entity113 last february was probably his best and more typical of his all - round contribution			1
it was more of a team goal for one thing , with @entity1 picking the ball up on the right and going on a mazy run and making not one , but two deft one - two 's with @entity121 and then @entity109 as he made the @entity113 players look like they were standing in treacle as he burst into the box and finished with a sublime dink over the keeper			1
so there was no doubt from @entity3 fans that he was worth the contract extension that he signed towards the end of the last campaign or that he is worth another at the end of this one			1
more surprising to us is that @entity14 has not made more use of him , with just six starts in all competitions so far this season and three of those in domestic cup games			0
yesterday 's performance was not unexpected from our midfield maestro at all			1
@entity1 is no spring chicken but he always shows the same energy , enthusiasm and ability as ever and i for one am hoping to be able to appreciate him more this season and at least one more			0
sign him up @entity14 , because talents like @entity1 do not come along too often			0
follow @ @entity150 on twitter the 34 - year - old @entity10 midfielder has firmly established himself as a favourite among the @entity3 fans @entity3 won the @entity6 in 2014 and will be looking to defend their crown after progressing to the fifth round			1

@entity1 's performance against @entity2 showed his class
@entity3 beat @entity2 3 - 2 in the @entity6 fourth round on saturday
@entity1 scored with a well taken volley to help them on their way
the midfielder 's overall contribution is deserving of a contract extension
