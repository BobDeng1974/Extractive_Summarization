@entity1 ’s super-rich are turning their backs on buying up historic stately homes in favour of building their own from scratch , according to luxury estate agents			1
experts in the top end of the property market say sky - high renovation costs and restrictive planning regulations are driving the wealthy to dream up their own ideal homes from scratch			1
and they are filling their dream homes with every conceivable luxury without the need for a bottomless sink fund to pay for the costly upkeep of older houses			0
pictured above is @entity28 , near @entity29 , @entity30 , which is on sale for £ 4million splendour : another striking example of the new opulence is the above property , @entity36 , near @entity37 in @entity38			0
it is currently on the market with an asking price of £ 7.5million @entity42 : pictured is the living and dining area of @entity36 , which is set in 56 acres of its own land and built in the @entity50 style with modern materials luxuriant : this indoor cinema room is another part of @entity36 , one of an increasing number of properties built to order on country estates of the super-rich the new , multi-million - pound properties have been popping up across the country over the past few years - and are being heralded as the stately homes of the future			1
wealthy buyers have been drawn to building new homes from scratch because the costs are significantly lower than restoring and running period properties			1
modern technology like eco-friendly biomass boilers and solar panels can dramatically reduce the running costs of new homes , which are easier to build and adapt in the first place due to laxer planning laws			1
however , the grandeur of the properties is unchanged from those built hundreds of years ago			0

interiors , too , have been given a modern makeover but traditional building materials such as wood and stone still feature highly			0

@entity226 , director of country houses at @entity228 estate agents , said : ' in recent years there has been a definite move away from the drafty , old rectories and @entity233 manor houses towards modern , comfortable and cost efficient properties			1
' it is many people ’s dream to design and build their own house exactly to their own specifications			0
' the quality nowadays is so much higher and the running costs are significantly less in comparison to centuries old houses			2

i think they will stand the test of time because the build quality is extremely high			0
' there are some similarities between new and old though - the principals of quality and grandeur are still as important as they ever were			0

modern stately homes are just following in that same tradition			2

' but it is even more evident at the top of the market where people can afford to build their dream homes with everything they want inside			0
' many large , older houses are listed buildings - making it difficult to adapt them plus running costs are often very high			1
' with modern stately homes you have the ability to build a property which is state of the art , cheap to run and environmentally friendly			2
' the emphasis is still on quality and being cutting edge , as well as showing off modern @entity1 architecture			2

estate agents say that the super-rich are no longer buying up existing stately homes but building their own
multi-million - pound properties are just as opulent as palatial homes of old , but with added cutting - edge features
some of the reasons driving @entity1 away from classic homes of the wealthy are high running costs and planning laws
