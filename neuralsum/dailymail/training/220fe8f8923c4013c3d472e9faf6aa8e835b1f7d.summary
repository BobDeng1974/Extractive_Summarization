@entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , last night held an event for alumni before it is due to close next month			1
but the party spiralled out of control when attendees - some in their 40s and 50s - began vandalising the building			2
the school blamed a ' small minority ' of the visitors for the damage , which prompted a clean - up operation this morning			2
carnage : a reunion at @entity9 in @entity10 had to be shut down thanks to ex-pupils ' behaviour the former pupils repeatedly set off the fire alarm when they refused to stop smoking in the toilets while drunk			1
they also drew lewd pictures on the wall , and damaged current students ' work which was on display			0
after police and firefighters were called to the scene , the revellers were told to go home early			1
former pupil @entity44 , who left the school in 2005 , said : ' i 've heard various stories that people were walking around drunk and did n't know what they were doing			0
' a few of the walls had graffiti on them , which is a shame because children now have to go to school this morning with their school emblazoned with graffiti			0
it 's sad it got out of control			0
' the school is set to merge with the nearby @entity9 to create @entity9			1
a similar reunion set to take place at @entity9 was cancelled after the carnage at @entity66			1
a spokesman for the academy said : ' unfortunately the evening had to be brought to a close earlier than planned due to health and safety concerns			0
' sadly a very small minority of adult visitors took it upon themselves to smoke within the building and write graffiti on the walls , causing vandalism to an operating school			0
' police said they were first called to the school to respond to issues over parking , but are now hoping to interview one of the visitors on suspicion of criminal damage .			2
