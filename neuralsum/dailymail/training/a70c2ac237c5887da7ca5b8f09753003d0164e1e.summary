by @entity0 painkillers taken by millions of @entity3 may be causing heart attacks , strokes and early death because they contain so much salt , a major study shows			1
patients who regularly take soluble forms of aspirin , paracetamol , ibuprofen and other common drugs are 22 per cent more at risk of stroke and seven times more prone to high blood pressure , the researchers found			1
they were also found to be 28 per cent more likely to die early			1
recommended doses of some of the painkillers were found to contain 50 per cent more salt than the safe daily limits for adults			1
soluble painkillers taken by million of @entity3 could be causing early death due to the amount of salt they contain , research shows the researchers behind the study , carried out by @entity32 and the @entity33 , are now warning patients to avoid regularly taking soluble painkillers			1
and they are urging drugs firms to print labels similar to those on food packaging on the tablets – most of which are sold over the counter – warning patients about high levels of salt			1
millions of adults , particularly the elderly , rely on painkillers for long - term conditions such as arthritis , while supplements such as calcium are commonly taken by pregnant women and those going through the menopause			1
many prefer taking the soluble varieties as they are easier to swallow and are thought to get to work more quickly as they have already been broken down			2
but the medicines contain very high levels of salt as it helps them dissolve in water and produce a fizzing effect			2
during the study , academics monitored patients who had been prescribed soluble forms of paracetamol , aspirin and ibuprofen as well as supplements such as vitamin d , zinc and calcium for an average of seven years			1
they trawled 1.29million patient records obtained from @entity76 surgeries across the @entity3			2
those taking the soluble pills for any length of time were 16 per cent more likely to suffer a heart attack , stroke or die early			1
they also found that patients were 22 per cent more likely to suffer a stroke , 28 per cent more likely to die from any cause and seven times more likely to suffer high blood pressure			2
on average , patients succumbed to these problems only four years after first being prescribed the drugs			0
certain painkillers were found to contain 50 per cent more salt than the safe daily limit government guidelines state that adults should eat no more than six grams of salt a day			1
patients taking eight soluble paracetamol pills a day – the full daily dose – exceed this amount by 50 per cent			1
the average adult eats about eight grams of salt a day , but experts calculate that if we all reduced that by three grams there would be 30,000 fewer heart attacks and strokes a year			0
by comparison a packet of ready salted crisps contains half a gram of salt , while a packet of salt and vinegar has one gram			0
a bowl of cornflakes – the saltiest cereal – contains around 0.4 grams , while two slices of bread have about 0.8 grams			0
the worst culprits are ready meals , which can contain seven grams per portion , and some ready - made sandwiches , which contain between three and four grams			0
professor @entity127 , of the @entity33 , said : ‘ we were surprised at how much salt there was in some tablets			0
researchers behind the study are now urging people not to take soluble painkillers on a regular basis ( library image ) ‘ all the foods we buy we can find out in intricate detail how much sodium ( salt ) there is but we ca n’t do that with medicines			1
’ he added : ‘ it ’s an avoidable risk and it ’s a cardiovascular risk which is the commonest cause of death in @entity3			1
if you take these drugs every day it would be better for your health to take the normal versions , not the soluble ones			0
’ the researchers only looked at patients prescribed the pills by their gp but they said millions of adults who buy them over the counter were also at risk			1
dr @entity161 , also from the @entity33 , said : ‘ these drugs are also available over the counter , they can be picked up in the supermarket			0
‘ we have no control over how many millions of people are buying these drugs			2
heart disease , which includes heart attacks and strokes , is by far the biggest killer in @entity3			2
it claims 180,000 lives a year			0
experts pointed out that patients taking the pills occasionally were probably not damaging their health			0
dr @entity175 , associate medical director at the @entity176 , said : ‘ we know that too much salt is linked to a higher risk of heart attack and stroke			2
‘ it ’s important to remember that this research applies to people who are taking these medicines every day – this does not mean that occasional use could damage your heart health			0
‘ to give us an idea of whether these risks translate for medicines bought over the counter , we would need to see further research focusing on non-prescription medication			0
’ ‘ this is an important reminder for doctors and patients to carefully consider the risks and benefits of soluble or effervescent ( fizzing ) medicines at the time of prescription			0
’ dr @entity204 , an expert in statistics who specialises in drugs safety at @entity32 ’s @entity207 , was also highly involved in the study .			0
