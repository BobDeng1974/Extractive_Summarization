fears : @entity132 and @entity216 criticized the regulations that kept @entity11 from getting an adult lung he called it troubling , and perhaps precedent - setting , for a judge to overrule that medical judgment , and predicted a run to the courthouse by patients who do n't like their place on the waiting list			1

@entity11 has had a second lung transplant after the first one failed earlier this month
she gained national exposure when her parents went public last month with the news that she only had weeks to live
initially she was n't allowed to be on the adult organ donor waiting list , and child donors are rare
a judge placed an order to put her on the adult list , and the national organ transplant *network* complied
since her second transplant she has taken her first breaths
