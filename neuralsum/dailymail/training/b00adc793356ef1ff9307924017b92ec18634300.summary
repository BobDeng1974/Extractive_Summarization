by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 today led calls for a ' rethink ' of the £ 90 price tag on the new replica @entity7 football shirt			1
the prime minister said fans would ' welcome ' the @entity10 and kit makers @entity12 reconsidering the hefty costs which have been condemned as a ' rip - off ' by fans			1
the government has insisted the charges are ' not right ' and risk punishing loyal supporters who are ' the bedrock of our national game '			0
scroll down to watch the @entity7 squad modelling the new kit problem : supporters fear they are being priced out of purchasing @entity7 's @entity27 strips - with the new @entity29 shirt costing £ 90 worth it ? the home and away kits go on sale for as much as £ 90 before the tournament kicks off fans are unhappy that the new , costly kit has been launched less than a year after the last new strip went on sale			1
it was only last may that the previous home kit was released , which has been worn just seven times			2
the red away kit , released even more recently in june 2013 , has had just two airings			2
the £ 90 shirt is identical to those worn by @entity46 's side , while an adult ' stadium ' @entity7 shirt is priced at £ 60 and shirts for children aged between eight and 15 cost £ 42 , with mini-kits priced at £ 40			1
sports minister @entity54 took to @entity55 to say : ' on £ 90 @entity7 football shirts for fans , it 's not right			1
loyal supporters are the bedrock of our national game - pricing needs a rethink			0
' prime minister @entity2 called for a rethink on the prices after a backlash from fans mr @entity2 's officials spokesman said the pm backed miss @entity54 and called for @entity12 to think again			1
he told a regular @entity71 media briefing : ' i 'm sure all fans would welcome a rethink			2
' the spokesman said it was ' clearly not ' for the government to set the price of football shirts			2
but he added : ' it is a matter for the manufacturers and the @entity10 , but does he agree with @entity54 that £ 90 is a great deal of money for a replica shirt ? absolutely			1
' would a rethink by the manufacturer be welcomed by all fans ? i 'm sure that would be the case			0
' @entity91 's shadow sports minister @entity90 said the price of the shirts was ' disappointing '			1
@entity94 , founder of popular parenting website @entity96 , said : ' with the previous kit less than a year old and the away shirt worn only twice since then , it 's not hard to see why some people might just think the @entity10 are exploiting @entity7 fans by churning out yet another expensively priced version			1
' when we asked our users about this this issue , an overwhelming majority thought football merchandise was a rip off			0
' instead of charging £ 60 - plus for an 8 - year - old ’s kit , the @entity10 could lead the way and produce a fairly priced kit so all @entity7 fans could afford to buy it and show support for the national team			1
' the latest shirts - to be worn at the @entity27 in @entity117 this summer - are going on sale on april 3 , less than a year after the previous ones were released			0
@entity120 , a member of @entity121 , said : ‘ they certainly do n’t help themselves the fact two new shirts were introduced well before the 18 months			0
‘ they seem to have broken that rule			0
i thought it was a legal requirement			0
‘ the @entity10 are in a difficult position , they ca n’t have a @entity12 home kit and @entity132 away kit			1
‘ i suppose the @entity10 ’s excuse for releasing the kits so early is that it ’s a @entity27 year , but i ’m sorry they should ’ve thought about that when they signed the contract with @entity12			1
’ added on top : if fans want to get added lettering with their shirt they 'll need to pay more money not happy ! @entity148 midfielder @entity147 is n't best pleased at the price of the shirt tough ! @entity151 has branded kit maker @entity12 a ' joke ' for the way in which they 've handled the release in the mid- 2000s replica @entity7 shirts were on sale for £ 30 almost as soon as they were released			1
the prices have since risen steeply , but they are dependent on results on the field			0
following @entity7 ’s 4 - 1 defeat to @entity167 in the @entity168 the price for the replica shirts worn in that tournament plummeted			0
@entity120 , who has been a member of the @entity121 for 18 years , added : ' at the end of the day people will vote with their chests			0
if @entity7 are doing well , people will buy it			0
‘ if they lose to @entity173 in the @entity27 it will drop to a fraction of that £ 90 price			1
’ outrage from punters and those involved in the game poured out across social media websites			0
@entity147 said on @entity55 : ‘ £ 90 for the new @entity7 shirt is taking the mickey out of the fans			1
when will it stop ? ‘ i wonder what ‘ magic ’ technology it has this time that forces the price up but does n’t actually work			0
coming thick and fast : these are the second new kits to have been released in the past year by @entity7 ‘ also [ it ’s ] technology that the supporters do n’t need			0
when will brands start to listen ? fans just want to feel a part of it			0
‘ [ it ’s ] appalling , in my opinion			0
@entity10 again allows commercialism to eat away at its soul			2
something has got to give			0
‘ its literally a white sports top with an @entity7 badge on			0
costs about £ 2 pound tops to make in some sweatshop in the @entity208			2
’ @entity151 added : ‘ @entity12 have gone down @entity216 route			2
a “ match ” shirt and “ stadium ” shirt , like @entity212 do			0
a joke , just make one please , £ 90 is a rip off			1
’ the @entity10 are not allowed by @entity217 and @entity219 law to get involved with setting the price of the replica shirts			1
a spokesman said : ' the @entity10 is a not - for - profit organisation that puts £ 100m back into the game every year			1
' it is through relationships with partners such as @entity12 that we are able to maintain that level of investment in football			2
' the @entity10 's policy is to avoid any involvement with how its partners or licensees set their prices , so as to avoid any risk of or implications of price fixing			1
' @entity12 have pointed out that the £ 60 replica kit is the one aimed at fans , whereas the £ 90 shirt is the exact one worn by the players with the full technological additions			1
the prices are recommended to retailers who are able to set their own value			0
a spokesman also confirmed that the kit cycle would return in future , saying : ' the previous kit marked the start of the partnership between @entity7 and the @entity10 and the timing of the agreement put us in an unusual circumstance with regards to kit cycle			2
' a normal kit cycle will resume with the new kits – the home kit will stay the same for two years , and the away for one year			2

premier wades into *row* over launch less than a year after last new kit
urges @entity12 and @entity10 to think again about costs
sports minister @entity54 says price is ' not right ' and punishes fans
@entity147 says the £ 90 costs it is ' taking the mickey out of the fans '
