a 1,700 - year - old lead tablet with a violent curse inscribed upon it has been discovered by archaeologists in @entity3			1
found in a wrecked @entity6 villa , the ' magical tablet ' is thought to have been created by a magician			1
the curse , written in @entity9 , which calls for help from six gods to punish a man called @entity13 , is believed to play a role in a bitter legal dispute and was ordered by a woman named @entity17			1
a 1,700 - year - old lead ' magical tablet ' ( pictured ) with a violent curse inscribed upon it , thought to the work of a magician , has been discovered by archaeologists in @entity3 in a wrecked @entity6 villa a translation of the ancient script reads : ' i strike and strike down and nail down the tongue , the eyes , the wrath , the ire , the anger , the procrastination , the opposition of @entity34			1
' she asks the gods to make sure that @entity34 is ' in no way oppose , so that he say or perform nothing adverse to @entity40 ... but rather that @entity34 , whom the womb bore , be subject to her '			0
@entity42 , of the @entity43 at the @entity44 said in a study , published in the journal @entity47 , that a professional magician probably created the curse for @entity17 , as the small script on the tablet is rapid and fluent , suggesting practice at inscribing leaden tablets			1
a translation reads : ' i strike and strike down and nail down the tongue , the eyes , the wrath , the ire , the anger , the procrastination , the opposition of @entity34 ' ' while the words might be purely metaphorical , it seems more likely that @entity17 actually used a hammer and nail ( s ) while carrying out a magical rite designed to enhance the efficacy of thecurse , ' the study said			1
professor @entity42 wrote : ' if she hammered and nailed several objects , they might have symbolised the seven items in the list of @entity34 ’ body parts and behaviours			0
' if it was just a single object , then it probably symbolised the first item in that list - @entity34 ’ tongue - or more generally the person of @entity34			0
whatever this object was , it was probably not the leaden sheet itself			0
' to judge from the tablet 's physical condition , it was neither pounded with a hammer nor pierced with nails , but merely has the type of damage that occurs to leaden tablets while laying in the ground or during opening			0
horizontal creases show that the tablet was folded from the bottom to the top between eight and ten times			0
the archaeologists believe both @entity34 and @entity17 were probably members of the @entity6 middle or upper class at war with each other over a legal matter , as the curse bears some resemblance to other tablets discovered in @entity106 that were also used in legal cases			1
the tablet was recovered from a ruined @entity6 mansion and suggests that the occupants of the building were wealthy , as several gems were found at the site alongside other decorative objects including the marble bust of a boxer			2
the discovery of the mansion and its contents provides firsthand archaeological evidence of the southward expansion of the @entity6 occupation over the southern part of @entity3 in the late third century @entity123 , professor @entity42 wrote			2
the ancient @entity124 at the @entity126 entrance to the @entity127 , is pictured come to me , you who are in the earth , chthonic daemon , you who rule and bind , @entity135 ; come , @entity136 , three - form queen , @entity137 ; come to me , king @entity138 , by your great name @entity141 ; come to me , chthonic @entity145 and chthonic @entity143 and @entity138 and queen @entity142			0
i strike andstrike down and nail down the tongue , the eyes , the wrath , the ire , the anger , the procrastination , the opposition of @entity34 , whom the womb bore , so that he in no way oppose , so that he say orperform nothing adverse to @entity17 , whom the womb bore , but rather that @entity34 , whom the wombbore , be subject to her			2
@entity159 , fulfi ll this perfect spell			0
( magical signs and letters ) the tablet was found in the northwest part of the building , which is believed to be around 2,000 square metres , along with pieces of mosaic and fragments of frescoes as well as a decorated box full of carved bone pieces			2
the curse calls upon six gods ( including @entity143 - a statue is pictured ) to help settle @entity17 's legal score with @entity176 archaeologists told @entity178 that a female figurine - possibly that of a goddess - was also recovered by the @entity181 and could have been used in a private cult of people living in the huge mansion			1
while they are unsure of the purpose of the room , on the first floor of the house , professor @entity42 said it could have been a place where @entity34 lived or worked , so the curse was close to him , or the room was near to a courtroom			0
the house was a large peristyle building of the @entity6 period has been unearthed on the northern part of the hill in @entity3 known as the @entity198 during excavations that started in 2007 and are still continuing			2
archaeological evidence suggests that the structure came to a violent end , as the latest coins found under the collapse of different rooms are from the year 363 ad , suggesting that the building was ruined as a consequence of the earthquake that occurred in @entity209 on may 18 of the same year			1
' no single coin retrieved from secure loci inside the building is dated later than 363 ad , ' the study said			1
the discovery of the mansion and its contents provides firsthand archaeological evidence of the southward expansion of the @entity6 occupation over the southern part of @entity3 in the late third century , professor @entity42 wrote .			0

the ' magical tablet ' was found in a huge @entity222 in @entity3 that was probably destroyed by an earthquake in 363 ad
th curse , against a man called @entity13 , is written in @entity9 and is *intended* to settle a legal dispute for a woman called @entity17 , some 1,700 years *ago*
an archaeologist from the @entity44 believes a professional magician probably *crafted* the tablet
