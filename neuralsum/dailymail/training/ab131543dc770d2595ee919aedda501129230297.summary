in 1905 , @entity0 calculated that the speed of light - thought to travel at 186,282 miles per second - remains constant when travelling through a vacuum			1
he also argued that , in theory , nothing can travel faster than light			2
while this has been accepted for over a century , a controversial new study suggests @entity0 was in fact wrong , and that the speed of light is slower than we think			2
the study was conducted by @entity13 - based physicist , @entity12 , who looked at why light particles of supernova @entity15 arrived 4.7 hours later than expected			1
the study was conducted by @entity13 - based physicist @entity12 who looked at why light particles of supernova @entity15 ( pictured ) , which exploded in 1987 , arrived 4.7 hours later than expected the star ’s collapse , which was seen from @entity20 in 1987 , triggered a burst of neutrinos - an electrically neutral , weakly interacting elementary subatomic particle			1
according to @entity0 , this should have happened roughly three hours before a burst of optical light - and from that moment on , the pulses should have kept pace , both travelling at the speed of light			0
however , the optical light arrived roughly 7.7 hours after the neutrinos - or 4.7 hours late			2
in 1905 , @entity0 calculated that the speed of light remains at a constant 186,282 miles per second ( 299,792 km per second ) when travelling through a vacuum			1
while this theory has been accepted for over a century , a controversial new study now suggests @entity0 was in fact wrong according to @entity0 , the speed of light remains at a constant 186,282 miles per second ( 299,792 km per second ) when travelling through a vacuum			1
in miles per hour , light speed is around 670,616,629 mph			0
this means that a traveller , moving at the speed of light , would circumnavigate the equator 7.5 times in one second			0
by comparison , a passenger in a jet aircraft , moving at a ground speed of 500 mph ( 800 km / hour ) , would cross the continental @entity46 once in four hours			0
the latest study suggests that the speed of light may be slower , but further research needs to be done to understand exactly how the delay is over vast distances			0
according to @entity0 , in theory nothing can travel faster than light			1
the @entity54 physicist believes the delay could have been because the light was in fact slowed as it travelled due to something known as ' vacuum polarisation '			2
during this phenomenon , photons break down to something known as ‘ positrons ’ and electrons for a split second			0
when they split , quantum mechanics creates a gravitational potential between the pair of ‘ virtual ’ particles			0
dr @entity12 argues that the process might have a gradual impact on the speed of the photon , meaning that over 168,000 light years , the photons may have suffered a near five - hour delay			1
if the physicist is correct , it means scientists have to recalculate everything from our distance to the sun to some of the most distant objects seen in other galaxies			1
dr @entity12 ’s paper has been submitted to the @entity87 and is currently undergoing peer review			0
the @entity54 physicist believes the delay may have been because the light slowed as it travelled , due to something known as ' vacuum polarisation '			2
during this phenomenon , photons ( artist 's impression pictured ) break down to something known as ‘ positrons ’ and electrons for a split second			0

@entity0 argued that , in theory , nothing can travel faster than light
speed of light in a vacuum is thought to travel at 186,282 miles per second
but @entity12 from @entity54 believes it is slower than this
in 1987 , light particles of a supernova arrived 4.7 hours later than expected
dr @entity12 suggests this may be because of ' vacuum polarisation '
this , he claims , had a gradual , but significant , impact on speed of photons
if he is correct , it means scientists have to recalculate everything from our distance to the sun to some of the most distant objects in other galaxies
