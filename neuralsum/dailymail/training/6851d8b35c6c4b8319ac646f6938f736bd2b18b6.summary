by @entity0 published : 10:50 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 11:47 est , 14 december 2012 a domestic violence charity has launched the world 's first audience - editing commercial , allowing the audience to view different events with each eye			1
the groundbreaking @entity8 cinema advert uses 3d stereoscopic technology to show two separate scenarios simultaneously			1
in one , a woman prepares a meal			0
and in the other , the same woman prepares the same meal , but a violent partner is added to the situation			0
with the haunting soundtrack of @entity38 's ' @entity37 ' , the commercial , created by leading @entity41 advertising agency @entity40 , simply asks ' will you turn a blind eye ? '			2
domestic abuse : in one of the scenarios , a woman tries to cook while her abusive husband shouts at her @entity48 , co-chair of women 's aid , said : ' women 's aid is delighted to have been part of the world 's first audience - edited commercial and would like to thank @entity40 for creating this groundbreaking advert with us			0
' at women 's aid we know that one in four women experience domestic violence at some point in their lifetime , but many of us ca n't imagine it happening to someone we know			0
yet it is happening all the time around us , without us necessarily noticing			0
' the technology used to make this advert allows the viewer to choose whether they see the abuse that is happening behind closed doors in a relationship			1
' the audience will have the ability to shut out the abuse and pretend it 's not happening , or they can choose to view the reality of living with domestic violence			1
' we hope it will open the audience 's eyes to the prevalence of domestic violence and let them know that women 's aid is here to help , as well as encouraging viewers to text to donate to support the lifesaving work of women 's aid			0
' watch the video here : @entity48 , co-chair of women 's aid , said : ' the technology used to make this advert allows the viewer to choose whether they see the abuse that is happening behind closed doors in a relationship ' @entity98 , creative director at @entity40 said : ' 3d is all about what your eyes see and what your brain creates , and plays on the fact that each of our eyes sees the same thing but from slightly different perspectives			1
' ' this got us thinking â€¦ what if you could create two stories , one for each eye , and leave it to the viewer to edit for themselves			1
what you get is technology that implicates the viewer in how much they choose to see or notice and a powerful advertising format that enables us to deliver a poignant message			2
' are you turning a blind eye ? in one scenario the woman cooks peacefully alone director @entity131 from @entity132 , who created the technology used in the ad , said : ' we were really excited about developing the technology to enable a completely new viewing experience and simultaneously bringing the script to life			2
' it 's the combination of audience involvement and powerful performances from the two actors that really helps convey the message			0
' the ad will run in selected cinemas across the @entity149 to coincide with the nationwide launch of @entity151 in @entity99			1
one in four : a quarter of all women experience domestic violence at some point in their lifetime , but many of us ca n't imagine it happening to someone we know to learn more about the campaign visit www.blind-eye.org and to learn more about women 's aid visit @entity161			0
