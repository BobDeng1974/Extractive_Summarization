by @entity0 published : 11:24 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 11:26 est , 24 may 2013 a now extinct giant flightless pigeon from @entity2 used its small but deadly wings to fight off competitors and communicate with mates , according to new research published this week			1
researchers from the @entity8 in @entity9 studied fossils of the solitaire , officially known as @entity12 , and in particular the unique ‘ musket ball ’ structure on the bird ’s wing			1
they discovered that the birds used the circular nodes as a way of fighting with other birds and fending off prey			2
researchers from @entity9 's @entity8 have discovered that the small ' musket ball ' knobs found in the wings of the now extinct solitaire bird were used for fighting			1
this artist 's impression shows what the pair of solitaires would have looked liked when fighting over territory in @entity34 valley on the island of @entity36			2
the birds became extinct at the end of 1700s the @entity12 , or pezophaps solitaria is an extinct , flightless bird that lived on the island of @entity36			1
it was genetically similar to pigeons and doves and is most closely related to the also extinct @entity44 of @entity2			1
the @entity12 was the size of a swan			0
males were much larger than females and measured up to 35 inches in length			0
females were around 28 inches tall			0
both sexes were highly territorial , with large bony knobs on their wings that were used in combat			2
the @entity12 laid a single egg , that was incubated in turn by both sexes			0
gizzard stones helped digest its food , which included fruit and @entity62 were first mentioned in the 17th @entity63 by @entity64 , leader of a group of @entity67 refugees who were marooned on @entity36 in 1691 – 1693			0
it is the only extinct bird with a former star constellation named after it , @entity70			0
writing in the @entity71 , ornithologist @entity72 from the @entity8 said : ‘ we know from detailed historical notes from eighteenth - century sailors that the birds were aggressive			1
' they also describe a musket - ball - like bony growth on the wings , which was originally thought to be the result of injury			1
when we compared the wings of solitaire fossils from the caves of @entity36 , an outer island of @entity2 , to modern birds we found that these growths were largest in adult males			1
' this means they were probably important in fighting , like a fighter ’s fist			0
’ ornithologists had previously thought that the musket ball growth in these birds was the result of disease or injury			1
fractures found during previous studies of the extinct birds ' bones confirm that they were aggressive animals			2
the solitaire was highly territorial and would fight regularly			0
it is thought the small knobs found on their wings may have been caused by fighting , but then evolved to make them better competitors researchers now believe that the structures grew as a result of combat or due to hormones when birds paired up to mate and defended their territory			1
many solitaire fossils contain healed fractures which supports this idea			0
‘ there are no living giant flightless pigeons for us to refer to , but museum collections such as those at the @entity8 contain thousands of solitaire fossils , ’ said dr @entity121 , a curator at the @entity8			2
' it is unlikely that the birds used the spurs solely for fighting as they also communicated with each other using their wings			2
historical records talk of people hearing the sound from almost 200 metres away			0
' the now extinct solitaire birds from the island of @entity36 are now thought to have been aggressive and territorial			1
they were reminiscent of the birds that star in the @entity142 game from developers @entity144			0
each bird is designed to destroy the egg - stealing pigs in a specific way			0

researchers from @entity9 's @entity8 have discovered that the small ' musket ball ' knobs found on the wings of the now extinct solitaire bird were used for fighting
it is thought that the knobs were a result of fighting and the @entity2 birds then evolved so the knobs developed *naturally*
the solitaires became extinct at the end of the 1700s but were genetically similar to modern - *day* pigeons
