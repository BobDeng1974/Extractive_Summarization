' he said the independence debate has prompted a discussion on @entity263 membership , adding : ' we ’ve got some things to say about how @entity24 might be outside the @entity263 with a reinvigorated fishing industry			0
' there ’s a gap in the political market for @entity14 in @entity24 that did n’t exist last year			2
