he was known as the @entity2 cat - murderer , a vicious hound sentenced to life imprisonment at @entity5 for the grisly killing of the governor 's moggie			1
in his prison mugshot from 1924 , he is seen with ears drooping backwards , an identification number hanging form around his neck looking decisively guilty			0
according to newspapers stories at the time , @entity15 attacked and killed a cat belonging to the wife of @entity2 's then governor @entity20			1
falsely accused : @entity15 ' @entity23 ' in his prison mugshot after being admitted to @entity5 showing absolutely no remorse for his despicable crimes , @entity24 was sent down for life with no chance of parole			2
@entity24 was actually entirely innocent , and his actual offence was nothing more serious than chewing the cushions of the sofa on the governor 's front porch			2
owner : @entity24 had been a gift to @entity2 governor @entity20 the account of him killing the cat was entirely fictitious , made up by a newspaper reporter taking a touch more than his fair share of journalistic licence			1
the editor loved the story as it was frequently reprinted bearing the mugshot picture			0
governor @entity20 's son would later recall how his father was inundated with ' absolutely thousands of letters ' about @entity51 and his prison sentence			1
of course the real story is far less exciting			0
@entity24 was originally a gift to @entity2 governor from the nephew of his wife @entity57			1
one of her relatives relative was a breeder of @entity61			1
he became a much - loved part of the household at the start of @entity20 's first term as governor which lasted between 1923 and 1927			1
but in early 1924 he began to develop a bad of chewing on the cushions of the front porch sofa			0
@entity20 decided that the unruly dog had to go and a trip to a penitentiary in @entity74 had given him the perfect solution			2
@entity24 was sent to @entity5 , but not as a prisoner			0
on his visit to @entity74 , governor @entity77 had seen dogs being used as therapy to help inmates rehabilitation , and thought @entity24 could be the perfect candidate			2
so the naughty dog was packed off to prison as a pet where he became a favourite among the inmates			0
lock up : @entity24 became a firm favourite with inmates at @entity5 in reality @entity24 was sent to the penitentiary as a pet for the prisoners after he developed a habit of chewing the governor 's cushions in 1929 when the new @entity97 prison was constructed about 50 miles away @entity24 would travel back and fourth with the prison work crew			0
he eventually died of natural causes and is buried on the prison grounds			0
the account of how @entity24 was framed is found in papers of the governor @entity20 's son at the family home in @entity106 , @entity2 about 130 miles northeast of @entity107 .			1
