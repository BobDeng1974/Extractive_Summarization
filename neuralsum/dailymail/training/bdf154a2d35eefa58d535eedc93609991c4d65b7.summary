by @entity0 published : 15:57 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 03:55 est , 29 july 2013 ' jerk ' : the change follows a ruling that @entity4 violated a demonstrator 's freedom of expression when he referred to @entity8 with the word being rude to the president of @entity4 is no longer an automatic criminal offence , @entity4 ’s parliament agreed today			1
in the interests of free speech , mps revoked legislation dating back to 1881 when anything judged to have ‘ offended the head of state ’ risked an automatic fine			1
the change followed the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) ruling in march that @entity4 violated a demonstrator ’s right to freedom of expression when he referred to @entity8 as a ‘ jerk ’			1
mr @entity8 , the notoriously aggressive 5ft 5ins conservative , became the butt of numerous jokes during his five years in office , which ended last year			2
but when a demonstrator held up a placard reading ‘ @entity33 ’ at a @entity8 meeting in western @entity4 in 2008 , he received a criminal conviction and a fine of around 25 pounds			2
this was despite exactly the same expression being used by @entity8 himself months earlier while he was attending an agricultural show in @entity41			0
last year @entity21 deemed the punishment handed down to @entity8 ’s tormentor as being disproportionate and a violation of freedom of expression , as the act was a ‘ satirical remark			2
’ the @entity21 acknowledged that the insult constituted ‘ criticism of a political nature ’ for which ‘ freedom of expression was of the highest importance			0
’ now anyone who chooses to insult a serving @entity4 president will have to be pursued through the libel courts			1
@entity55 , the current @entity56 @entity4 president , is regularly mocked , often by people using his nickname of ‘ @entity59 ’ , after a wobbly caramel pudding			1
earlier this month it emerged that @entity8 views his successor as a ‘ ridiculous little fat man who dyes his hair ’			0
barely disguised hatred between the two politicians has been well documented , but it was the first time that @entity8 ’s bitter language was reported in public , by @entity69 , the highly respected news magazine			0
@entity8 , 58 , was roundly beaten by the portly socialist , who is also 58 , in last year ’s presidential election – and both men are seen as comic figures			0
@entity59 : current @entity4 president @entity55 , whose figure earned him a nickname inspired by a wobbly caramel dessert			1
he is even less popular than mr @entity8 , who has called him a ' ridiculous little fat man ' when @entity8 was head of state , his third wife @entity80 put him on a fitness programme aimed at making him leaner , fitter and younger looking			0
before that the diminutive @entity8 - nicknamed ' @entity83 ' because of his love of tacky status symbols - was himself mocked for being a chubby little man			2
he continued to wear platform heels , and to surround himself with smaller men in an attempt to look taller , but lost a great deal of weight through constant work - outs and giving up chocolate			0
@entity55 , in contrast , has failed to lose the tubby image and shake off the @entity59 nick - name			0
opinion polls routinely reveal that @entity55 is the most unpopular president in the history of the @entity100 , with @entity8 a close second .			1

@entity21 ruled @entity4 violated a protester 's right to free speech when he was prosecuted for calling @entity8 a ' jerk '
current @entity4 president @entity55 regularly mocked , with his figure earning him the nickname ' *flanby* ' after a wobbly caramel dessert
