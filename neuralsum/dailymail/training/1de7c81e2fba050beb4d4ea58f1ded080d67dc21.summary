having tipped @entity0 to win the @entity1 i must say their opening performance against @entity4 was an anti-climax that highlighted vulnerabilities , particularly in defence			1
the brightest thing about thursday evening from the hosts ’ point of view was the extraordinary home support , as i saw close up			2
to watch the match i made a three - hour journey through some of the worst traffic i ’ve ever seen into the mountains above @entity18 , to share the occasion with two former @entity21 team - mates , @entity22 and @entity23			1
@entity18 in @entity18 : @entity24 ( centre ) with former team - mates @entity26 and @entity23 plus friends watching @entity0 - @entity4 they had a big crowd of family and friends around to watch the game , 25 people in one room , including six kids			1
when the first note of the national anthem played , every single person stood up , held on to each other with something approaching fervour , and then absolutely belted out the anthem , every word of it as if their lives depended on it			2
never mind the hairs on the back of my neck , i had a chill down the spine being part of that			2
it was the most extraordinary demonstration of what the @entity1 means to these @entity57			2
the game is in their dna and not just those among them who are footballers			2
then the game started and everyone watched in silence , nervous as it remained scoreless through the first 10 minutes and then shocked as @entity4 took the lead			1
at that point @entity22 said to me , quite dryly : ‘ if it stays like this , you wo n’t be going back down to @entity18 tonight			2
it ’ll be mayhem down there if we lose			0
’ a great leveller : @entity76 celebrates after equalising for @entity0 against @entity4 the room was quiet , despondent , but it did n’t stay like that as @entity76 equalised and then @entity0 went on to win			1
they were lucky , frankly			1
the penalty for 2 - 1 was an absolute joke			0
there was no way whatsoever that should have been a penalty			0
the most generous interpretation was that it was a dubious decision			0
the ref was conned , in my view			0
i hope for the sake of the tournament that it was n’t an early sign that poor officiating could spoil things			0
@entity4 started well and deserved to be ahead			1
the @entity0 back four were visibly uncomfortable with the ball being crossed into the area			1
against better teams and better strikers i fear they are going to have problems			0
as attacking full backs , @entity100 and @entity101 are right up there among the best in the world , but as pure defenders , let ’s just say they ’re not at the same level			0
as for the rest of @entity0 ’s team , i do n’t get what @entity112 ’s purpose is in there			1
what 's his purpose ? @entity112 ( right ) is n't a ball winner or a creator and it is n't clear what he brings to @entity0 he ’s not a ball - winner who breaks up play			1
he is n’t a creator			0
i ’d have @entity125 in way ahead of him			0
@entity127 and @entity128 were the best performers for me			0
@entity76 was relatively quiet by his own standards , even if he scored twice			0
that ’s the mark of a really great player , doing not much then contributing something significant when it matters			0
after the final whistle we went outside to play foot - volleyball on the twins ’ full - size beach volleyball court			0
@entity22 and i were beaten by @entity23 and a mate of theirs , who plays for @entity141			1
a whole new ball game : @entity24 ( right ) plays beach volleyball with the @entity22 twins and a friend i got back to @entity18 late , and there were still umpteen impromptu matches being played all along the beach			1
there are people everywhere in football shirts — @entity0 , @entity152 and @entity153 especially			1
but those people aside , it ’s odd			2
there ’s no other sign a @entity1 is unfolding around us			0
just people , in love with football .			1

@entity0 's *victory* over @entity4 was an anti-climax
@entity24 watched the match with @entity23 and @entity26
@entity0 were lucky to win and vulnerable *defensively*
there are no billboards or posters in @entity0 , just people who love football
