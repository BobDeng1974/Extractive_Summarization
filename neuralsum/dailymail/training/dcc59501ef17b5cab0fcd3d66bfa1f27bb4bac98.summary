inspired : @entity0 totally changed his style of writing after reading a 16,000 - word , amphetamine - fuelled letter by his friend @entity3			1
that letter is set to go up for auction in @entity6 next month it has been called the letter that launched a literary genre			2
@entity3 wrote 16,000 amphetamine - fuelled , stream - of - consciousness words in a missive to @entity0 in 1950			1
on reading them , @entity0 scrapped an early draft of his latest novel and , in a three - week writing binge , revised it into a style inspired by @entity3			1
that novel was @entity19 , and its style became known as beat literature			0
the letter , @entity0 said shortly before his death , would have transformed his counterculture muse @entity3 into a towering literary figure , if only it had n't been lost			1
turns out it was n't			0
it was just misplaced , for 60 - some years			2
at least , so says @entity28 , boss of @entity29 , a southern @entity6 action house putting the letter up for sale next month			2
the letter is being offered as part of a collection including papers by @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and other prominent literary figures			0
but mr @entity28 believes the item bidders will want most is @entity3 's 18 - page , single - spaced screed describing a drunken , sexually charged , sometimes comical visit to his hometown of @entity47			1
' it 's the seminal piece of literature of the @entity50 , and there are so many rumours and speculation of what happened to it , ' he told the @entity56			0
@entity0 told the @entity57 in 1968 that poet @entity58 loaned the letter to a friend who lived on a houseboat in @entity6			1
@entity0 believed the friend then dropped it overboard			1
' it was my property , a letter to me , so @entity58 should n't have been so careless with it , nor the guy on the houseboat , ' he said			1
as for the quality of the letter , @entity0 described it this way : ' it was the greatest piece of writing i ever saw , better'n anybody in @entity73 , or at least enough to make @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , i dunno who , spin in their graves			2
' it turns out @entity58 apparently was trying to get it published when he mailed the letter to @entity85 in @entity86			2
there it remained , unopened , until the small publishing house folded			0
when it did , its owner planned to throw the letter in the trash , along with every other unopened submission he still had in his files			0
that was when the operator of a small , independent music label who shared an office with publisher @entity102 came to the rescue			0
he took every manuscript , letter and receipt in the @entity108 home with him			0
up for sale : this image provided by the @entity113 auction house shows the cover of an auction catalog , featuring several pages of what has become known as the @entity118 , some 16,000 @entity120 - fueled , stream - of - consciousness words written by @entity3 to @entity0 in 1950 @entity121 : left to right , @entity122 , @entity0 and @entity58			1
@entity0 blamed @entity58 for losing the letter , believing the poet had loaned it to a man living on a houseboat who dropped it in the water ' my father did n't know who @entity58 was , he did n't know @entity3 , he was n't part of the beat scene , but he loved poetry , ' said @entity138 performance artist @entity137 , who found the letter as she was cleaning out her late father 's house two years ago			1
' he did n't understand how anyone would want to throw someone 's words out			0
' although she knew who @entity0 and @entity3 were , ms @entity137 had never heard of the @entity118 , the name @entity0 gave it for @entity3 's description of a woman he 'd had a brief romance with			1
on the road : @entity0 's 1957 masterpiece , which he totally transformed in draft stage after reading @entity3 's account of a drunken visit to @entity47 ' it 's invaluable , ' historian and @entity0 biographer @entity157 said			1
' it inspired @entity0 greatly in the direction he wanted to travel , which was this spontaneous style of writing contained in a letter that had just boiled out of @entity3 's brain			1
' it was a style he 'd put to use in the novels @entity19 and @entity166 , which featured @entity3 , thinly disguised under the names @entity169 and @entity170 , as their protagonists			2
he 'd continue to use it in such books as @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 , cementing his reputation as the father of the @entity50			0
@entity3 would gain some small measure of fame as @entity0 's muse and , later , as the sidekick who drove novelist @entity183 's @entity185 bus across the country			1
meanwhile , about a third of the @entity118 , copied by someone before it disappeared , became well - known to students of @entity0			2
when ms @entity137 discovered she had the whole thing , she took it to mr @entity28 , a prominent dealer in historical documents and pop - culture artifacts , to authenticate it			0
he 's reluctant to estimate what it might sell for			0
although the original manuscript of @entity19 fetched $ 2.4million in 2001 , everyone knew that existed			0
it 's much harder to estimate the value , he said , of something no one knew was still around			0
for her part , ms @entity137 says she 's just happy her father rescued the letter from the trash			2
she 's hoping whoever buys it will give the public a chance to see it			0
' the letter is so good , and you see why these guys loved him , ' she says of @entity3 's fellow beats			1
' the writing , it just breathes off the page			0

speed - fuelled 16,000 - word letter written by @entity0 's muse @entity3
it tells the story of a brief romance on a drunken visit to @entity47
@entity0 believed @entity58 had lost the letter after loaning it out
