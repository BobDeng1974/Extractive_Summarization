as saturday night 's show came to a close and the @entity4 crowd erupted into applause for @entity7 's rendition of @entity8 , the 29 - year - old contestant could n't hold back his emotion			1
not only was it the pinnacle of @entity7 's @entity4 journey , but as @entity7 explains to the @entity12 , it also felt like the culmination of years of hard slog in the music industry			1
' it was emotional , ' @entity7 says from his tour bus			2
‘ for me it all came to a head , thinking back over what i ’ve been through and the reasons i entered the competition			1
' @entity7 could n't hold back his emotion on saturday night 's show : ' for me it all came to a head , thinking back over what i ’ve been through and the reasons i entered the competition ' this week @entity7 is riding up and down the country in his very own tour bus with friends and family on board ' for me , it 's about trying to succeed in an industry that for i 've been trying to making it in for years , to the point of nearly giving up			1
' @entity7 has sung in bands with his big brother , @entity39 , since they were children , and for the best part of a decade has been playing gigs up and down the country , hoping to break into the industry			1
' we used to play gigs around the @entity48			0
when you 're spending money on petrol and not being paid anything to cover costs , it becomes hard slog			1
' i started thinking , " i ’m playing to five or ten people and i 've travelled all this way			2
what for ? " people are just there to drink – not really to listen to your band anyway			0
' @entity7 won enthusiastic reviews for his first song on saturday night , @entity65 left : @entity7 feeling good after his first performance on saturday night ; right : on stage with @entity68 receiving the news that he was through to this week 's final vote for @entity7 ! just to hammer the point home , @entity7 stood in front of some very important words ' no one 's ever said , " you 're not good enough " but then again i have n't always had the best feedback			1
i 've been heckled on stage with people saying " get off " and stuff like that			0
' it 's no different to the rubbish gigs that countless other musicians will have experienced			2
but when you 're not getting the recognition you want to , it does start to get to you , ' admits @entity7			2
who do you want to win @entity4 2014 ? who do you want to win @entity4 2014 ? now share your opinion as he sang the last few notes of @entity94 's melancholic tune , those experiences were whirring round his head			2
not all the judges were complimentary of @entity7 's rendition but @entity68 said : ' i am going to remember that performance			1
your voice broke in places because you 're emotional ... you 've earned your place in this final			0
' @entity7 explains : ' at that moment , that stage felt like an amazing place to be and everything was going through my head			1
i was also thinking how much that moment could change mine and my family 's life			1
' so what would it mean to the van driver from @entity115 to win ? ' @entity116 , ' @entity7 says			1
' it would make my life ! ' it would help get us , my family , in a better place			2
we live in a council estate and me , my mum and brother live together			0
so i 'd like to sort my family out with somewhere else to live			2
' @entity7 with fellow finalists @entity127 ( left ) and @entity128 ( right ) after the sunday night results show ' i just want to make my mum ’s life a bit easier			1
i 'd like it if she did n’t have to worry as she gets older and for her not to have to work quite so hard , ' he adds			0
the other important women in the singer 's life is his girlfriend of six - and - a - half years , @entity138 , who the singer plans to propose to in the near future			1
but for the moment , what 's on @entity7 's horizon is going on tour with his x factor buddies			1
' it 's going to be the most amazing experience , ' @entity7 says			1
' it 'll be a taster of what want to do for rest of life – to make make music and play gigs			2
' this week @entity7 is riding up and down the country in his very own tour bus with all his friends and family on board			1
left : with girlfriend of six - and - a - half years , @entity138 , who the singer plans to propose to in the near future ; right : @entity7 in boots and skinny jeans - a look he says he 's picked up from being on the show ' i ca n’t believe there ’s a bus with my face on it – it ’s a massive coach full of people that mean everything to me			1
that 's the most important bit			0
' it ’s going to be the busiest week of my life but i ’m looking forward to it and @entity68 may even pop on			0
' the music mogul , @entity7 says , has been a great source of support and advice			1
' he 's always told me to stay focused and try to be true to the musician you want to be in the real world			0
' he ’s lovely - he ’s had all that success but he ’s just a normal guy			0
' i respect all the judges , which is why i do n't mind the criticism			0
on the @entity4 you put yourself up on that platform to take on people ’s opinions and be judged			0
but it 's lucky to be in a position to get a critique from these people who have been in the industry for years			1
' before appearing on the show , @entity7 says he was ' jeans and t - shirt guy ' but says he 'll take away some style tips			1
going well , then ? the 29 - year - old heart throb gave a big thumbs up as he arrived at @entity207 's @entity206 studios @entity7 on stage in the quarter final - throughout the live shows , the finalist has won rave reviews for his rock voice from judges and @entity4 fans ' i 've always worn trainers , so wearing boots and skinny jeans is new to me			1
there have also been a lot of leather jackets			0
leather jackets were n’t exactly what i would have worn previously			0
' obviously being caked in makeup is not what i 'm used to either but i wo n’t be taking that into my daily life			0
' but having a team of people working with you and styling you have been great			0
at least i have n’t had to wear any sequin onesies or anything like that ! ' contrary to rumours , @entity7 confirms the boys in the house have n't been ordered to lose weight by x factor bosses			1
' there 's no truth in that , ' he says , but does admit : ' there 's been a biscuit and chocolate ban in the house since i got here			0
they do n’t want everyone gorging themselves on choc and sweets , which is understandable			0
' but there 's been no specific message for me and @entity128 to stop eating and go on a diet			0
' anyway , you want to look after yourself when you 're on stage - you want to look good and feel confident			0
' but one area @entity7 says has been slipping is his fitness			2
x factor madness has meant he does n't have time for his regular hour and a half daily swim and has spent less time in the gym			2
' my brother is big into the gym and he ’s in great shape so he usually spurs me on , ' he admits			0
can @entity7 reveal what audiences have in store this weekend ? ' i ca n't give anything away , ' he says			2
' but everyone ’s in for something really special ? the @entity273 takes place on @entity275 at 8.30pm on saturday december 13 and 8pm on sunday december 14			0

@entity7 , 29 , from @entity115 could n't hold back his emotions on live show
says : ' it all came to a head , thinking back over what i ’ve been through '
*describes* ' hard slog ' of years spent trying to break into music industry
' also thinking how much this could change mine and my family 's life '
