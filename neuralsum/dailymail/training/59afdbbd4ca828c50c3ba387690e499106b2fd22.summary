the @entity5 town was taken by @entity1 forces in the 12th century
it was then *transferred* to @entity1 rule in the first treaty of @entity19
@entity16 later took back control of town , but it was never signed over
historic links mean it is still referred to as ' @entity25 ' by some @entity1
*complication* shows how *legally* tangled @entity16 and @entity1 are
@entity80 's @entity81 - mp for the area - *praises* ties between two places
