@entity0 has revealed dramatic plans to replace cargo ships with crewless ' drone boats ' controlled remotely			1
the firm is developing a ' virtual deck ' in @entity6 that would allow captains to remotely command ships anywhere in the world			1
drone ships would be safer , cheaper and less polluting for the $ 375 billion shipping industry that carries 90 percent of world trade , @entity0 says			2
a fleet of drone ships : drone ships would be safer , cheaper and less polluting for the $ 375 billion shipping industry that carries 90 percent of world trade , @entity0 says			2
cameras would beam 360 - degree views from the drone ship back to operators based in a virtual bridge			1
@entity0 is already testing a @entity22 system in @entity6 for navigating the vessel remotely to steer them to their destinations			2
the firm eventually hopes it would be able to remove all crew from the ship			2
@entity0 has already begun the process of designing giant drone ships able to shuttle cargo across the ocean minus a single solitary human being on board			1
the @entity40 engineering group 's @entity38 marine innovation department have announced the concept of the robot vessels they believe would be able to carry more cargo , cut costs , be safer and produce less pollution			0
cameras would beam 360 - degree views from the drone ship back to operators based in a virtual bridge vr system in @entity6 navigating the vessel remotely to steer them to their destinations			1
talks have commenced over any regulatory obstacles and potential perceived hurdles and @entity0 are optimistic that the drone ships may be operational in ten years time			2
a @entity0 spokesperson says : ' some steps have already been taken , mainly in the naval area , but we believe a first step will be moving certain functions on a ship ashore			0
' for example , remote engine and equipment monitoring and some underwater operations - such as controlling @entity70 - in the offshore sector could be the first			0

the firm has already begun outfitting ships with advanced cameras			0
' a growing number of vessels are already equipped with cameras that can see at night and through fog and snow - better than the human eye , and more ships are fitted with systems to transmit large volumes of data			1
' so , some questions : given that the technology is in place , is now the time to move some operations ashore ? is it better to have a crew of 20 sailing in a gale in the @entity101 , or say five people in a control room on shore ? ' the same person could monitor and steer many ships			0
' the crewless ships would also be cheaper to build an maintain , @entity0 says			0
@entity108 , where the @entity109 is trialling virtual reality headsets			1
here , a soldier is seen operating a virtual ship - with commands that could one day remotely control a real warship			1
now @entity0 has revealed similar plans for cargo ships			0
' many facilities and systems on board are only there to ensure that the crew is kept fed , safe , and comfortable			0
' eliminate or reduce the need for people , and vessels could be radically simplified , reducing construction costs			0
' we think it is time to consider a roadmap to unmanned vessels of various types			0

ships would have no crew on board
