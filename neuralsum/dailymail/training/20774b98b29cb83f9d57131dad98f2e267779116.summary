by @entity0 what a quarter - final draw this will be			2
every tie should be a brilliant contest			2
of course the big three — @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 — are the favourites , and it ’s hard to look beyond one of them , but you ca n’t rule anyone out			1
@entity13 and @entity14 might seem the easier teams on paper , but @entity13 reached the final last year and @entity14 are second in @entity17			2
@entity18 are so strong and @entity19 , for all their issues , can still cause sides problems			2
i do think , though , that @entity23 have a chance to recreate the glory of 2012			1
they rode their luck that year , but the memories are still fresh and under @entity29 they look fitter and stronger			2
he knows how to win big matches and nobody will fancy testing themselves against him			2
two wins in three years ? @entity23 were underdogs to win in 2012 but they could replicate that famous win in @entity35 red hot favourites : @entity6 can become the first team in the @entity39 era to successfully defend the trophy going through : @entity19 secured their place in the last eight with a thumping 3 - 0 win at @entity44 i think @entity23 could win it this season , i really do			1
under @entity29 they are aggressive , they press the ball and @entity29 loves being an underdog			2
he wo n’t want to play a team like @entity14 because it will be a similar match , but against the bigger sides he knows what it takes to win			1
they are defensively sound and with a good draw they could do it			2
you look at what they did in 2012 and you still ca n’t quite believe it			1
they are in better physical condition and the only thing that will hold them back is the lack of a top - class goalscorer			2
@entity71 : @entity72 he has matured into an outstanding player this season and he has everything			0
when you look at his performances , it ’s easy to forget just how young he still is			0
been there , done it : @entity29 has won the @entity39 with @entity82 and @entity83 - can he become the first manager to do it with three clubs ? on a roll : in @entity72 , @entity23 have a player of the very highest calibre @entity6 @entity91 @entity90 20/1 click to view these odds and more it 's amazing to think @entity19 are rank outsiders in this competition			1
most teams would be happy to draw them , but nobody would want a second leg at @entity44			0
it was a good display on wednesday and if they get a result against @entity105 next week , their price might just change			0
they are not a terrible team , it ’s more of a confidence issue			1
a few more performances like the one against @entity111 and they can restore some belief that has been lacking			0
the quarter - final and clash with @entity105 will go a long way to deciding if @entity116 is still there next season			0
@entity71 : @entity119 he ’s been disappointing and will have been stung by criticism , but top players always produce , as he did on wednesday night			0
the catalyst : @entity19 fought back from the bring , beating @entity111 3 - 0 at @entity44 to seal their spot in the last eight flying @entity124 : the form of @entity119 will be key to @entity19 's chances of progression in the competition @entity14 have a real aggressive nature to their team this season			1
last year @entity132 was the unknown man but this year it ’s @entity134			0
he has his team very well organised and is always barking orders on the touchline			1
i ’ve been impressed with @entity139 and @entity140 , and @entity141 is a real star striker			0
@entity71 : @entity141 so strong and if anybody looks like a @entity29 player , it ’s @entity141			0
suits you , sir : @entity134 ( left ) and @entity141 have been integral to @entity14 's resurgence in form how 's stat : @entity150 is top of the charts when it comes to fouls committed by any player left in the competition @entity7 are always in the frame but you ca n’t help but think of last year ’s 7 - 0 aggregate defeat by @entity6			1
they missed @entity160 in that tie but the result will still be on their minds			0
they are not the side of three years ago and have defensive worries			1
@entity168 is not a good enough defender			0
@entity71 : @entity160 not at the same level as 2010 but a genius who can destroy anybody			0
an accident waiting to happen ? @entity168 ( left ) is a weak link while @entity160 is back to his best flying the flag : @entity7 fans cheer on their side against @entity105 in the last 16 i said last year they ’d win it and i still think they will be the first team to retain it			1
they are a team full of stars and they all know their jobs			1
if any side can trouble them it ’s @entity23			1
the memory of the 2012 final is there and with @entity29 and @entity192 in charge , the mind games will begin			2
@entity71 : @entity194 it ’s very hard to pick one main man , but @entity194 has everything : pace , skill and real star quality			0
making his point : @entity192 ( left ) can steer @entity6 to their sixth @entity39 win with the likes of @entity194 in the side @entity13 were so thrilling to watch last year but are not at the same level			1
they have suffered injuries and lost @entity206 to @entity6			1
but they got to the final last year so have pedigree			0
@entity71 : @entity209 the @entity210 is a beautiful footballer but with a move in the summer you question his drive			0
black and gold : @entity13 are 14/1 to win this year 's @entity39 pole star : but @entity209 will miss the first leg of @entity13 's quarter - final after picking up a booking in the defeat to @entity220 the dark horses this year			0
@entity18 have two of the world ’s best strikers in @entity225 and @entity226 , but they are strong in midfield too and @entity228 is one of the best defenders around			0
they were unlucky to lose to @entity7 last year and nobody will want to draw them			1
@entity71 : @entity226 it ’s easy to pick out @entity225 , but @entity226 is an unsung hero			0
he has quality and works hard			0
superstar : @entity225 has the ability to win matches on his own for @entity18 strong supporting cast : @entity226 has had an excellent first season in @entity239 , netting 18 times in all competitions they are finding their rhythm at the right time			1
they have two heavyweights in @entity246 and @entity247 but @entity248 has been an unsung hero			1
despite all his trophies , i ’ve always felt @entity251 is a bit of a liability at the back			0
but with those attackers , they are capable of anything			0
@entity71 : @entity247 he is a game changer and the one man you would n’t want to come up against as an opponent			1
a liability : @entity251 ( right ) is not the best central defender left in the competition a force of nature : @entity247 ( right ) has everything in his locker and will look to bring @entity8 a first @entity39 since 2002			1

@entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 are the favourites , but you ca n’t rule anyone out
i do think that @entity23 have a chance to recreate the glory of 2012
@entity7 are not the side of three years ago and have serious defensive worries
@entity8 have @entity246 and @entity247 and are finding their rhythm at the right time
@entity6 are a team full of stars and i think they can retain their title
