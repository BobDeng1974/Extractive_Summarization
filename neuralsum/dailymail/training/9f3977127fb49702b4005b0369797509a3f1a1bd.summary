by @entity0 published : 14:05 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 05:33 est , 2 october 2013 drug mules @entity3 and @entity5 are in brilliant health in a modern well - equipped prison , an @entity2 priest said last night			1
father @entity8 visited the pair in @entity10 last saturday where he found them sitting under a parasol in a yard in the jail drinking coffee and making phone calls			1
very , very well , ' he said			0
' they were n't in a cell			0
they were out in a wide open space sitting at a table with a parasol , they were talking and drinking coffee			0
i thought they were in great form actually			0
' father @entity8 , who had to wait a month to be allowed in to visit the young women because of a flu outbreak in the prison , said the pair can sit out all day every day and make as many calls as they wish , so long as they have money to cover it			1
his remarks come as the two appeared for a private hearing with a judge at @entity30 jail , in @entity30 , near @entity58 , yesterday looking healthy and apparently with new items of clothing , including new shoes			1
@entity3 even had a new hairdo - getting rid of her trademark bun in exchange for long , straight locks			1
last week @entity3 , 20 , from @entity66 , @entity67 , and co-accused @entity68 , 20 , from @entity69 , pleaded guilty to drug smuggling when they appeared before a judge			1
they had hoped the behind - closed - doors admission would be enough to secure a shorter sentence			2
settling in : the pair were visited by @entity77 who claimed he found them sitting under a parasol drinking coffee in the yard of their new prison contact : both @entity5 , left , and @entity3 have also been allowed to call their families so long as they pay for the cost of the calls however , the prosecutor in charge of their case said that the pair could face a six - month investigation if their guilty pleas are rejected			1
speaking after yesterday 's hearing , @entity95 said that the women 's confessions had not satisfied prosecutors			1
if their pleas are turned down by the court , prosecutors could force them to return to the interrogation room and give more details about the smuggling gang which allegedly gave them the drugs			1
mr @entity95 refused to say whether or not the women had told him anything more about the gang			2
they were moved to the modern jail after spending time in the harsh @entity114 prison in @entity58			2
change : the pair had spent time in the harsh @entity114 prison in @entity58 before being moved to a new jail story : @entity5 and @entity3 initially claimed they had been kidnapped and forced to board a flight with cocaine hidden inside their luggage father @entity8 said he did not speak to the pair about their legal case			1
but he said that he took @entity3 to one side during the visit and advised her that she should not expect to secure a sentence as low as one year			2
the priest said he expected a seven year sentence , which could be reduced at a later stage			0
@entity3 was very emotional when the priest warned her about the jail sentence			2
he said the women were sadder and wiser for the experience			0
father @entity8 also suggested they might get moved to a new prison in the north of @entity58 after sentencing which has an area dedicated for foreigners			1
the priest said local media reports had not done the women any favours , with stories saying that they had " behaved badly " in @entity147 and were then sent to @entity10 to act as mules			0
grilling : @entity5 , left , and @entity3 , right , pleaded guilty to drug smuggling last week hearing : the pair will be asked to expand on their statements before their guilty pleas are accepted father @entity8 said the prosecutors want the girls to hand over names and addresses of the gang who coerced them into the trafficking			1
' they do n't have that			0
all they have is the name of a cockney @entity166 by the name of @entity169 or @entity170 and that 's no good , ' he said			0
' i think they just do n't have that information themselves			0
my firm belief is that they were conned , they were backed into a compromising situation and their handlers worked on that and got them to go to customs with drugs			0
' what very likely happened was that people coming behind them in the queue in the airport were the ones who walked through with the drugs			0
' @entity3 and @entity68 initially claimed they were kidnapped , held at gunpoint and forced to board a flight from @entity58 to @entity195 with 24lbs of cocaine in food packets hidden inside their luggage when they were arrested .			2
