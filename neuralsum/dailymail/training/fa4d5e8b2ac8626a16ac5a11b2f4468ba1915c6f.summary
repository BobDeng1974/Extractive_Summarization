the murder rate in global violence hotspots has declined by more than 40 per cent in 15 years thanks to better policing and a lower tolerance for disruptive behaviour , experts have revealed			1
murders in @entity9 and @entity10 have dropped by eight per cent , in @entity11 by 19 per cent and in @entity12 by a staggering 61 per cent , new figures show			2
it means , the murder rate in @entity9 and @entity10 is now at its lowest level for 36 years , while the homicide rate in the @entity17 is at its lowest in 40 years			1
data by the @entity19 reveals the vast number of countries where murder rates fell by 40 per cent or more between 1995 and 2010 ( above , dark green ) and those where crime increased ( red ) the graphic shows the top ten countries which have seen the biggest decrease in murder rates since 1993 the data , which will be presented at the first @entity30 in @entity31 this week , shows how murder rates have been declining since the mid- 1990s in many parts of the world			1
@entity35 as diverse as @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , and @entity40 have seen average recorded murder rates drop by 40 per cent or more and out of 88 countries where trend data could be found , 67 showed a decline in homicide			1
only 20 showed an increase between 1995 and 2010 , the analysis of data from the @entity19 revealed			2
experts believe the drop in murder rates could be part of a wider trend which has seen improved policing strategies , tighter surveillance , and a lower tolerance for violent and disruptive behaviour from an earlier age , be rolled out in many countries			1
professor @entity60 , director of the @entity61 at the @entity31 , said : ' examples of successful homicide reduction over the past 15 years can be found across the world : from @entity65 and @entity66 to @entity67 and @entity68			0
' but if we want to achieve a worldwide decline in homicide we need to learn from these success stories and understand what they did right			0
murder rates have been declining since 1995 in many parts of the world			2
the latest figures ( displayed above in a graphic showing the areas with the highest murder rates ) show how rates have dropped by about 40 per cent ' evidence from many places in the world suggests reductions in violence by about 2.3 % per year - needed for a 50 % drop in 30 years - are feasible and realistic			1
' he emphasised that the figures did not yet show an overall global decline because some countries - primarily @entity92 - have seen recent increases in the number of murders committed which may offset the overall picture			0
however , he said that many @entity99 , @entity12 @entity92 and @entity98 countries have shown a steep decline in murder rates over the past two decades , and the lessons from these nations need to be built on			1
he added : ' in @entity105 , the risk of being murdered has declined by a staggering 99 per cent from the @entity106 to the present day			0
' in the last ten years alone , the number of homicides in @entity105 has been cut in half , from around 200 in 2003 to less than 100 in 2013 , for example - making it one of the safest cities in the world			0
' in @entity9 and @entity10 , the murder rate has dropped by eight per cent to 1.04 per 100,000 population since 1995			1
in @entity11 , the rate has dropped by 19 per cent to 1.8 per 100,000 population and in @entity12 it has fallen by 61 per cent to 1.4 , according to the data			0
experts now believe that global rates of violence could be halved by 2040 if the right policies can be defined and implemented			0
analysis shows that societies with the highest murder rates in @entity92 , @entity38 and @entity98 – such as @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity40 – suffer from a mix of corruption , highly profitable illegal markets , low investment in public health and education , and an ineffective police force that is not trusted by the citizens			2
' making the state more legitimate in the eyes of its citizens , the police more effective and accountable , and promoting the rule of law will be critical to achieve a significant decline of violence , ' @entity60 said			0
professor @entity141 , director of the @entity31 's @entity142 , added : ' an accountable and effective police that are trusted by civil society is indispensable			0

murder rates fell by 40 per cent in some countries between 1995 and 2010
of 88 countries , 67 have shown decline in homicide while 20 have increased
murder rates in @entity9 and @entity10 are at lowest for 36 years , data reveals
experts believe the trend could be down to better policing and surveillance
