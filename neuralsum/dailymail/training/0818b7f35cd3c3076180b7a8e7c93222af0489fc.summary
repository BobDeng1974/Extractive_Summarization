former prime minister @entity1 's childhood home was expected to be demolished within weeks the demolition of former prime minister @entity1 's birthplace has been put on hold			1
mr @entity1 , who died on tuesday aged 98 , was born at the house in @entity6 , @entity7			2
his parents sold it when he was one year old and the family moved to @entity11			0
the three - bedroom home , which went under the hammer for $ 3.3 million last year , was given the tick of approval to be ripped down just one week before @entity1 passed away on tuesday			1
the demolition order was lodged for the 46 @entity18 street site , known as ' @entity19 ' in april , before an application for heritage protection was rejected by the office of planning minister @entity23			1
however , mr @entity23 said on thursday he had applied for an interim protection order to put the demolition on hold , a move granted by the @entity28			1
city of @entity31 mayor @entity30 said the council was pleased ' this valuable piece of @entity35 's history ' was being protected for now			0
the demolition will be on hold for about four months while the issue of heritage protection is examined			2
mr @entity23 said the interim protection order meant works on the property had to stop immediately and it would allow for a fresh consideration of the property 's cultural significance given mr @entity1 's death			1
he said he had no direct power as planning minister to intervene and any person may apply for an interim protection order as he did			1
@entity1 's parents took out a house mortgage at the beginning of 1915 and the home was built by may that same year			2
the house , built in 1915 , at 46 @entity56 has been relatively untouched since the 1920s the home in the affluent suburb of @entity6 was sold for $ 3.3million in november last year @entity31 council attempted to save the home after declaring it was of ' local individual heritage significance ' due to @entity1 living in the house for the first two years of his life until the family moved to @entity11 with his father 's job in 1918			1
following an investigation , the council deemed the home as heritage - worthy due to @entity1 's childhood links to the property before it lodged a heritage protection request to the @entity74 in may			1
however , the planning department rejected the application in september because the demolition order was already approved before receiving the heritage request , the @entity75 reported			2
@entity1 's parents built the home in 1915 after taking out a mortgage following the sale last year , the home was listed on realestate.com.au as displaying ' splendid original character and grand room proportions offer endless scope to renovate / extend or perhaps create a luxurious new home			2
' former owner @entity88 , who sold the house in january , met @entity1 , along with his parents , when the politician visited his childhood home in the 1960s			2
' he turned up in a @entity95 car , ' mr @entity88 told the @entity75			0
' we had afternoon tea together , and found him to be a charming and congenial fellow			0
' the @entity98 took a mortgage out from the @entity100 of @entity101 on 30 january 1915 to build the family home which was completed by may that same year , the @entity103 reported			0
the announcement of @entity1 's birth was published as taking place at @entity107 , @entity56 , @entity6			0
legend has it - that @entity1 was delivered on the kitchen table in the home the following year after it was built			1
however , two years after his birth , the family uprooted to @entity11 after his father , @entity115 , was promoted to deputy crown solicitor the living area is one of many rooms with box and bay windows in the home the house features a large formal dining room and lead light windows looking onto the garden @entity1 is believed to have been born on the kitchen table in the @entity6 home in 1916 mr @entity88 said before he and his brother made the sale they expressed their preference for the new owner to only make renovations to the house			1
' it 's my view that a plaque should be placed in the pavement outside the house , ' he said			0
@entity140 said he expected the house , which has been relatively untouched since the 1920s , to be pulled down within a couple of weeks as the demolition process had already begun			0
he said the fact that many people had visited the home since @entity1 died proved its historical significance			0
' we 'll lose a large bit of @entity35 history , ' he told the @entity75			0
the house currently features a large formal living and dining room - along with a sun room and box and bay windows .			0
