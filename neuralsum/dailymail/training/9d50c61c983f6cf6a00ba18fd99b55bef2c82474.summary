by @entity0 @entity1 believes his appointment as manager of @entity4 has helped take his mind off the pressing business of a @entity7 with @entity8			1
@entity10 ’s team take on @entity11 in a mouth - watering @entity13 game in @entity15 on friday , a repeat of the 2010 final won by the @entity17			1
but with the 62 - year - old about to take over at @entity19 after the tournament , he claimed tonight that his imminent move to @entity22 has not hindered his @entity7 preparation			2
i do n't think this is the place			2
' @entity43 is a championship and clubs do n't take part in this , so i am fully focused on the national team			2
' distraction ? it may be a distraction but , for instance , the players - when was it ? - on monday afternoon and tuesday morning , i gave them some time off , just to get out there			0
' you ca n't just focus monotonously on the @entity7 , so perhaps @entity4 was a good distraction			1
you ca n't be fully focused on football for five weeks			0
' @entity10 was not coach of @entity8 when they tried to kick @entity11 off the pitch in losing 1 - 0 at @entity61 , @entity62 , four years ago			1
kicking off : @entity8 's @entity63 fouls @entity11 's @entity64 four years ago too strong : @entity11 celebrating lifting the @entity65 after beating @entity8 1 - 0 but on thursday he defended the rough house tactics of @entity68 ’s team			1
' i believe that physical resistance is part and parcel of football , ' said @entity1			0
' there is a referee that will point out what the limits are and i think the team four years ago did not cross the line			1
' it is obvious you have a different opinion , which is a shame			0
i think the physical struggle is part of football			0
it is part of sport			0
if you watch our training sessions you can see it for yourself , in the structure and process we have			0
