by @entity0 published : 17:55 est , 21 september 2013 updated : 11:14 est , 22 september 2013 they call them iceberg homes because so much is hidden beneath the surface – and they are proving very controversial			1
in @entity6 , where property prices keep rising and space is at a premium , ever more people are deciding to expand their homes downwards , creating vast basements – and in may cases a great deal of upset among the neighbours			2
@entity17 heir @entity16 is one of the latest members of the capital ’s super-rich to join the iceberg trend , planning a double basement complete with underground pool , car park and gym			1
buried treasures : the modest exterior of the extended £ 5.95million mews house which hides a 1,130sq ft. basement extension those living close to such developments often complain of the noise and vibration created – and object to the road closures frequently required while excavated material is removed form the site			1
there are also concerns about the effect that digging so deep can have on the water table			2
@entity41 is one of those who has successfully navigated the problems of creating an iceberg home , recently completing a basement extension in a mews house in @entity49 , @entity6 , that is now for sale for £ 5.95 million			1
@entity52 , 50 , has long - standing links with the area			2
besides his work as a property developer , he owns @entity58 breakfast haunt the @entity59 , where celebrities such as @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 are regularly seen sipping coffee			1
in fact , his family have been well known around @entity49 ever since his father , @entity68 , launched the @entity69 on @entity70 in 1973			0
this was the first kebab house to open in the capital outside the @entity75 community in @entity76 and is still there today , under the same ownership , keeping late - night revellers ’ appetites satisfied			0
deeply luxurious : a lounge in the @entity6 property which also boasts four bedrooms , a media room and a wine cellar @entity52 , who is married with a two - year - old daughter , ca n’t be charged with running roughshod over his neighbours ’ concerns when he developed his iceberg home , despite the fact he dug 23ft down to create two underground storeys comprising 1,130 sq ft. when he made the planning application for the development , the only objection he received was from a neighbour who was n’t concerned by the subterranean digging – she just insisted the garage was n’t used as a living area , which he was happy to comply with			1
@entity52 says his application was helped by the fact that another nearby resident had recently carried out a major basement development			1
the development did not come cheap			0
he spent £ 35,000 on simply renting two parking spaces at the rear of the house for vehicles to remove the excavated matter from under the house			1
@entity52 , 50 , works as aproperty developer and owns the famous breakfast haunt the @entity59 on top of that , he had to seal the basement storeys with a silicon membrane and fit a pump to deal with excess levels of water rising from beneath the house			1
‘ i could have gone down further , ’ says @entity52 , ‘ as i encountered fewer problems than other developers building basement extensions – largely because it is a mews house with direct access to roads on either side , which is very rare			0
’ @entity52 , who bought the house from an offshore company that had used it as a rental property , spent a large sum on the renovation , but the result of digging two new storeys is that a modest mews house has been transformed into a modern palace			0
‘ the main challenge was getting natural light in all the storeys , ’ he says			0
‘ this was helped by the fact that there are windows on both sides and i have created an open - plan effect with skylights and glass partitions throughout , which means sunlight reaches the bottom floor			0
‘ i like square rooms and the overall feel of the property is warm , cosy yet chic			0
’ the house now has four bedrooms , three with en suite bathrooms			2
there is also a shower room and a utility room and an abundance of entertaining space – a ground - floor reception , a dining room , a further reception room , and a media room with bar and wine cellar on the lower basement , plus a large garage			1
@entity171 , of selling agents @entity173 and @entity174 , believes the underground development will make the house attractive to a range of potential buyers			2
‘ what is extraordinary about this house is that it offers a true alternative to the typical townhouse style , ’ says @entity179			0
he says the house is finished to a luxury standard and believes that the probable buyer is already looking or living in the @entity190 , @entity191 or @entity192 areas			0
‘ properties with such width are rare , and this mews in particular is positioned in a very quiet and discreet position and would suit buyers looking for good security and discretion			0
this particular package is very hard to find in @entity49			0
’ whoever buys the house , regulars at the @entity59 can be reassured that @entity52 has no plans to allow his property developing sideline to take him away from in his catering work – thus ensuring that a great tradition that began with his kebab - selling father in the 1970s continues			1

@entity41 , owner of the @entity59 cafe , is selling his £ 5.95m home
the @entity216 was recently extended under ground
the ' iceberg home ' now has four bedrooms , media room and wine cellar
