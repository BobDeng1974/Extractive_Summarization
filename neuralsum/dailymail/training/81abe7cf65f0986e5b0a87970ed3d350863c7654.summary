@entity1 's remarkably serene build - up to the @entity2 includes agreeing player bonuses for @entity4 with the minimum of fuss well in advance of the big kick - off			2
the squad are understood to be on around £ 350,000 each for winning the tournament , with the deal heavily incentivised for progressing through the group stage			1
the terms were settled last january , with club @entity1 having set financial parameters			2
the smooth negotiations were helped by the current good relationship between the @entity17 and the players ’ representatives , which has not always been the case			2
resolved : @entity1 have already tackled the issue of bonus money well ahead of the @entity2 this is in stark contrast to the troubles other competing teams , especially @entity25 and @entity26 , have encountered			2
the team , as they do for all international appearances , will donate @entity2 match fees to charity			1
and the bonuses , despite being a hefty figure , are relatively insignificant for a squad of millionaires , with @entity35 earning £ 300,000 a week at @entity36			1
the importance of sports psychiatrist @entity38 to @entity1 ’s @entity2 challenge was demonstrated by manager @entity40 inviting him to sit in on the media interviews he did on thursday , with @entity40 wanting to utilise @entity38 ’ ‘ huge brain ’ as much as he can			1
also present at the manager and captain media conferences were coach @entity45 and three young players - @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 - though one ca n’t imagine @entity45 encouraging the trio to be helpful with the press			1
guidance : @entity45 will be @entity40 's number two in @entity4 new kid on the block : @entity47 is one of @entity1 's @entity56 who will be hoping to have a real impact former football journalist @entity58 , president of the @entity60 football federation , has emerged as a potential @entity62 candidate to take on @entity63 for the @entity65 presidency			1
@entity62 want @entity63 to face a proper opponent and @entity58 fits the bill			0
and the 63 - year - old , with powerful federation backing , would be not be derailed by defeat			0
@entity40 has rather less of a @entity2 pedigree than the great @entity72			1
but both are @entity2 ambassadors for @entity76 watchmakers @entity74 , with special timepieces named after them			0
there ’s a @entity79 and a @entity80 which @entity40 ’s son @entity81 , a former @entity74 employee , helped design			1
@entity83 , asked what he would rescue first if his house was on fire , nominated his watch collection			0
pedigree : @entity40 has @entity2 experience after taking @entity76 to the @entity90 in 1994 more pedigree : @entity72 has won three @entity92 , more than any other player in history cellino @entity2 ruck the @entity97 ownership fiasco since @entity98 took charge has even started to have an impact on the @entity101			1
the @entity102 , who has embarked on a heavy cost - cutting exercise , is said to be no lover of rugby union and has been questioning with @entity107 2015 every aspect of the contract he has inherited for two games — @entity102 v @entity112 on september 26 and @entity113 v @entity90 on september 27 — to be held at @entity114			0
it ’s understood @entity116 wants to know what the exact cost will be for @entity97 and how they will benefit , right down to the bar takings			1
an er 2015 spokeswoman said : ‘ we have a good working relationship with @entity97 and with @entity123 , who have plans to capitalise on tourism and the visitor economy through hosting two @entity129 games			0
’ unwelcome : @entity98 ( right ) is the unpopular new owner of @entity97 meanwhile beleaguered @entity130 , whose faulty computer system caused considerable problems for @entity134 and the @entity135 , at least managed to get through the first day of their @entity2 tickets sale without crashing			0
@entity138 ’s bizarre rules about their presenters working for other organisations somehow allowed @entity141 to promote bookmaking firm @entity142 with @entity143 despite cricket ’s serious match - fixing issues			2
yet @entity146 is prevented from supporting @entity148 ’s sponsorship of test cricket			0
after questions about the @entity142 advertising on @entity152 during wednesday ’s odi at @entity154 , a @entity156 spokeswoman said : ‘ after consulting with @entity138 , @entity141 will not be doing any further work for @entity142			0
’ disallowed : @entity146 ( right ) was prevented from supporting @entity148 's cricket sponsorship			0
