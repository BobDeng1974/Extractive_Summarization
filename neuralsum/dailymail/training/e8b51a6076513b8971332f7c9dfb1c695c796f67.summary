at the last race in @entity2 it was great to see we were still as strong as we have been all season			1
for me personally , qualifying in the rain did not work out for various reasons ; partly i did n't do a perfect job and partly some technical faults which meant i qualified fourth			1
in the race , i completely lost all the telemetry communication between the car and the engineers so the engineers could never see what was going on , which meant they could n’t help me on track – i was completely on my own ! moving on up : @entity20 speaks to the media on thursday ahead of this week 's @entity23 @entity22 battle : the @entity26 driver passing @entity27 en route to finishing second at the @entity30 the team , and all the engineers , are always following what is going on inside my car via telemetry			1
so during a race they help me with things like fuel consumption , tyre pressures , settings , the balance of my car - so at a pit - stop they can correct an imbalance – and brake balance			1
in @entity2 , i had none of that help			2
so , i had to drive according to what i felt and had to handle things , like fuel consumption , on my own			1
normally , they have sensors inside the tyres , too , which show my team what the pressures are at any moment in time			2
tyre pressures are really , really important for the car performance , so i was hugely compromised			1
they also could n't set the clutch setting , which you need to start a race , so i had a terrible start and ended up way down in seventh after the first corner			1
from then on i fought my way back through the field , and it was great to still finish the race second – it was the perfect damage limitation after a very sub-optimal weekend because so many things went wrong			1
it shows how good our car is and how good our team is			2
@entity76 moment : @entity20 celebrates on the podium with @entity79 and @entity80 we 've had a three - week break so there has been a lot of time for the teams to develop their cars – which this year , more than ever , will be a very fast development race – so we are expecting everybody to bring much faster cars to this week 's race			1
the @entity23 @entity22 is always a milestone in the season ; if you are quickest here then it is likely that you are going to be the quickest for many more races to come			1
i have spent time in the factory this week working with the guys and i had a big talk with the whole factory on wednesday just to say ' thanks ' and to give them some insight into what is going on			0
i was also in the simulator , preparing for @entity106 and the race weekend			1
@entity106 is , of course , a track that i know better than any of the circuits			0
i have driven here so much because we usually do all of our winter testing here			0
i like the track and it should suit our car which leaves me optimistic for the weekend			0
i went well here last year – i secured pole position – so everything is pointing towards a good weekend ahead			0
my team - mate @entity79 has come off three wins in @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity2 now , so it is important to try and break his momentum , turn it around , and get the win myself this weekend , so i am aiming to do just that			1
team game : mercedes are bidding for their fourth straight one - two finish at this weekend 's @entity23 @entity22 i went to the opening round of the @entity133 championship in @entity26 last weekend			1
while i was there , it was a great pleasure to drive five - time world champion @entity136 's 1954 @entity129			1
@entity137 , my pr manager , had the idea of doing a ' selfie ' while i was driving , and the video and photos turned out really well			0
nobody has done that before , so that was a new one ! i am proud because when driving @entity136 's car you clearly see the history of the @entity147 in @entity148 which is just massive			1
on track : @entity20 takes a ' selfie ' whilst driving @entity136 's @entity151 at @entity152 compatriots : @entity20 poses with @entity154 in between races i spent time with my friends , family and fiancee , trained and re-energised for the @entity160 season			1
i also met @entity154 , one of @entity26 's best players			2
i played some soccer with him on the river in @entity164			0
i 'm huge fan of football , so it is always great to meet the players			2
@entity154 is an easy - going and a nice guy			2
he was telling me that @entity169 still have the @entity171 final against @entity172 to come which is a big thing for them			0
and in terms of the @entity175 he is very excited and he is looking forward to that			0
i will be meeting the @entity26 team in their training camp after the @entity179 so that will be lots of fun , too			0
last week marked the 20th anniversary of @entity185 's death , but we must n't forget that two drivers lost their lives at the 1994 @entity189			2
@entity190 was killed in qualifying on a tragic weekend for the sport			0
i find it unfortunate that it is always just @entity185 who is mentioned because he had a bit more success			0
that said , @entity185 is a legend of the sport and one of the best of all time			0
it was a great loss			0
i remember the weekend very well			0
i was sitting in @entity202 in our kitchen waiting for many , many hours with my mum and cousin , listening to the radio for an update			0
because of that awful weekend , the safety in the sport has moved on massively			2
there was a big push after that , and we are still benefiting from it today			0
we need to keep pushing because the sport needs to be safer and safer , but it is going in the right direction which is fantastic to see			0
@entity20 's fee for his column will be donated to the @entity219 , which is dedicated to providing help to former and current @entity148 mechanics and their families , putting @entity148 mechanics throughout the world in touch with each other and raising funds to help in times of need			2
you can follow @entity20 on @entity231 @ nico_rosberg and @entity129 @ @entity232 .			1

finishing second at the @entity30 was perfect damage limitation
i suffered a telemetry issue which massively compromised my race
but i 'm ready to stop @entity79 's winning momentum in @entity23
i was proud to drive @entity136 's title - winning @entity129
