by @entity0 published : 17:56 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 02:54 est , 20 september 2013 if you spend every single day in a zoo enclosure , you could be forgiven for wanting some privacy now and again			1
but this extrovert otter still went out of his way to wow the crowds by juggling with a pebble			2
he put on a show for visitors to the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , to the delight of those around			1
but while his cute display may be amazing the humans , the otter laying right next to him barely seems to notice			1
the other creature , potentially the juggler 's partner , looks lazily over out of one eye before deciding she has better ways to spend her time			1
the performing scamp is part of a family of @entity53 short - claws otters that live in the park , which also has penguins , sea turtles , jellyfish , sharks and giant @entity60 @entity59			1
' look what i 've found ' : the otter grabs a pebble and looks around before his performance ready ... : the otter gets ready to launch the rock , to the bemusement of his partner @entity53 short - clawed otters are the smallest species of otter in the world , and weigh only 5kg			1
the furry animals live in water , but their fur is so thick that their bodies never actually get wet			2
they are often tamed and used as pest control to rid rice paddies of crabs			2
the mammals can live for up to 16 years and stay faithful to their mate for life			2
otters have many quirky habits , including banging rocks against clams and on their tummies to crack shells			2
at night , sea otters hold hands with their mate while they sleep to stop them floating apart			2
great catch ! : he starts to throw the pebble back and forth look at me ! : despite his trick , the otther next to him seems more interested in her own tail share what you think the comments below have not been moderated			0
@entity111 , @entity112 , 3 days ago " otters are the cause of our declining water vole population			0
they just love to snack on furry things after eating all the eels " @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , 21/9/2013 09:32 ... they 're not the cause			0
sure they will effect the voles , and certainly there are more otters around now - but voles decline where otters are not present too			1
the big reason for vole decline is damage to habitat and mink - not otters			1
there are a sight more voles than there are otters , and a damn sight more mink ! the big reason for eel decline is humans ! @entity146 , @entity122 , @entity123 , 3 days ago otters are the cause of our declining water vole population			0
