by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 13:30 est , 4 may 2013 updated : 14:54 est , 4 may 2013 the once - secret identities of the three @entity5 ' whistle - blowers ' have been revealed just days before they were set to testify at a congressional hearing about the deadly 2012 attacks on @entity8 in @entity9			1
on wednesday , the three @entity11 officials will appear on @entity12 before the @entity13 to talk about the september 11 , 2012 , assault on the @entity15 in @entity5 that resulted in the deaths of ambassador @entity17 and three other @entity8			2
@entity18 revealed saturday that the key witnesses are : @entity20 , the deputy chief of mission at the @entity21 in @entity9 at the time of the @entity5 terrorist attacks ; @entity24 , a @entity25 and now the deputy coordinator for @entity27 in the agency ’s @entity28 ; and @entity30 , a diplomatic security officer who was the regional security officer in @entity9			1
' for me the @entity43 is on the inside of the [ @entity11 ] building , ' the former mission deputy chief angrily said while speaking at a hearing chaired by @entity49 @entity48 rep. @entity48 in october 2012			1
during his testimony at the time , @entity39 detailed for lawmakers how he and the late ambassador had repeatedly asked to increase security at the embassy in the months leading up to the attack , but said that their pleas fell on deaf ears as the situation in the country continued deteriorating			2
witness accounts : the three career diplomats who were in @entity9 during the 2012 attacks will appear before a congressional hearing to testify about the deadly events of last september the two other @entity11 officials have never publicly spoken about the attacks			2
at the time of the deadly attacks , @entity20 was the highest - ranking @entity8 diplomat serving in @entity9			1
@entity71 rep. @entity70 , a @entity72 and members of the @entity74 , said that @entity20 - a veteran officer of the @entity34 - was in @entity35 on the night of the attack when he received a distress call from @entity17			1
' we 're under attacks ! we 're under attacks ' @entity17 reportedly yelled into his cell phone			0
according to the @entity71 congressman , @entity20 reacted to the news by calling @entity83 to alert officials and set off an ' inter-agency response			2
' what remains : as the investigation into the attack continues , the consulate remains damaged according to the @entity11 website , @entity24 ' advises senior leadership on operational counterterrorism matters , and ensures that the @entity8 can rapidly respond to global terrorism crises			2
' victim : @entity8 ambassador @entity17 was killed during the attack @entity20 and @entity24 are believed to be represented pro bono by @entity97 , a former @entity8 attorney , and his wife , @entity99 , a former chief counsel of the @entity100			1
of the three men , @entity39 is the only one who does not consider himself a whistle - blower			2
according to @entity107 and @entity99 , their clients ' accounts of the attacks in @entity5 were dismissed by then - secretary @entity109 's @entity108 , and the two civil servants have been subjected to an intimidation campaign by their superiors meant to stop them from telling the truth about the tragic events in @entity9			1
the revelation of the witnesses ' identities comes just days after the @entity119 administration denied that it was prohibiting any @entity8 personnel who survived last year 's attack on the @entity8 @entity122 in @entity5 , @entity9 from testifying before @entity123 about what they experienced			1
the @entity13 announced on wednesday that it will convene a hearing on may 8 aimed at ' exposing failure ' in the @entity119 administration to respond to security threats to that diplomatic mission , and to present to the public and to @entity123 an accurate version of the attack that left ambassador @entity17 and three other @entity8 dead			1
' this administration has offered the @entity8 people only a carefully selected and sanitized version of events from before , during , and after the @entity5 terrorist attacks , committee chairman @entity48 , a @entity72 congressman from @entity49 , said in a statement			0
' not surprisingly , this version of events casts senior officials in the most favorable light possible			0
' @entity143 insisted in a press briefing that no administration employees had sought security clearances so they could testify about he @entity5 raid , even after the @entity13 asked for those very clearances @entity48 's committee has already shed public light on the @entity11 's denials of requests for more robust security at the consulate in @entity5			1
and in an october 2012 hearing , it produced evidence contradicting the administration 's initial claim that the the sept. 11 , 2012 military - style assault on the diplomatic compound began as a ' protest ' sparked by a low - budget @entity165 video that lampooned the @entity168 prophet @entity167			1
' next week ’s hearing will expose new facts and details that the @entity172 has tried to suppress , ' @entity48 said			0
at least four surviving witnesses to the @entity5 attack have retained attorneys to help them navigate the process of testifying before @entity123 about what they saw			0
they are all employees of the @entity179 and the @entity11 , according to a @entity18 report			0
the @entity8 @entity122 in @entity5 , @entity9 was attacked and burned on sept. 11 , 2012 in a military - style attack that killed the @entity8 ambassador and three other @entity8 @entity49 @entity183 > @entity48 ( @entity184 ) has announced a hearing in which the @entity13 , which he chairs , will hear testimony from survivors who say they have been blocked from telling @entity123 what they know			1
@entity190 rep. @entity189 ( r ) has promised that the @entity5 attack is ' not going away despite the efforts of this [ @entity119 ] administration ' president @entity119 denied on tuesday that he was aware of any @entity8 personnel who were being prevented from sharing their observations with congressional investigators			1
' i 'm not familiar with this notion that anybody has been blocked from testifying , ” the president said in response to a reporter 's question , ' so what i ’ll do is i will find out what exactly you ’re referring to			0
' both the @entity179 and the @entity11 have told @entity123 that no employees have requested the security clearances that their lawyers would need before talking to @entity123			2
and on wednesday , @entity119 's chief spokesman @entity143 insisted during a @entity210 press briefing that ' @entity5 happened a long time ago , ' and that ' we are unaware of any agency blocking an employee who would like to appear before @entity123 to provide information related to @entity5			1
' attorney @entity99 represents a survivor of the @entity5 attack whom she says the @entity119 administration has blocked from testifying by refusing to give her the necessary security clearance to learn what her own client knows but @entity99 , who represents two of the witnesses , told @entity18 that administration officials are issuing ' some very despicable threats to people ... they 're taking career people and making them well aware that their careers will be over ' if they testify			1
the @entity11 , she said during a separate @entity18 interview , has ' had two letters from chairman @entity48 , one on april 16 , the other one april 26 , that specifically say , " we want you to provide a process for clearing a lawyer to receive classified information			0
" ' ' how can they possibly get up there and just lie to the press corps ? ' she asked , referring to the president and his spokespersons			0
@entity99 , according to her her husband and partner , who was interviewed wednesday on @entity244 affiliate @entity243 in @entity83 , already possesses a @entity246 clearance , and would only need a letter from an administration attorney in order to learn what her client already knows			0
@entity252 explained on monday that ' the @entity11 is refusing to grant clearances to @entity254 and other people who want to represent the whistle - blowers , in an attempt to prevent the testimony			1
' the @entity259 released these photos on wednesday of individuals who sere seen near the @entity5 consulate on the day @entity9 terrorists attack it , killing four @entity8 including the @entity8 ambassador			2
the raid on that diplomatic outpost happened eight months ago @entity210 @entity72 issued a scathing report on april 23 criticizing the @entity119 administration for a series of intelligence failures and an attempted cover - up after the @entity5 raid			1
when then - secretary of state @entity109 testified before @entity123 , she disputed that it was important to determine whether the raid was carried out by terrorist militants or by an angry group of protesters , as the administration first claimed ' on april 26 , congressman @entity48 sent a letter to the new @entity281 , @entity282 , demanding that the lawyers who are going to represent the whistle - blowers be cleared - be given clearances - so they can talk to their clients and the committee about classified information , ' @entity252 said			1
' she got a new @entity246 security clearance within the last year			0
and now they will not clear her or any of the other lawyers to represent the @entity11 people			0
' ' there is going to be a @entity297 showdown here , ' he predicted , ' and ' @entity123 is going to win			0
the administration 's effort to cover up whatever happened in @entity5 is going to fail			1
' ' the whistle - blowers are out there , ' @entity107 insisted			1
' these are great @entity8			0
they were on the ground in @entity5			0
they want to tell their story and the administration is going to do everything it can to stop them from testifying under oath in public			0
and they want to protect @entity109 [ @entity311 ] and the president			0
that 's what this is all about			0
' @entity316 @entity72 rep. @entity189 , who serves on the @entity13 , said wednesday that he was ' not at liberty to disclose the identity of the witnesses ' who will appear at next week 's hearing			2
' @entity5 is warming up , ' @entity189 promised during a televised interview			0
' it is not going away despite the efforts of this administration			0
' @entity325 , shown here in a file photo , said @entity5 survivors ' want to tell their story and the [ @entity119 ] administration is going to do everything it can to stop them			2

@entity24 is a @entity25 and now the deputy coordinator for @entity27 in @entity28
