by @entity0 published : 03:01 est , 31 july 2012 updated : 10:15 est , 31 july 2012 tube trains to the @entity2 were suspended this morning			1
spectators travelling to @entity4 on the central line at around 7am were told all services were terminating at @entity7 due to an incident at @entity9			1
a defective westbound train was awaiting the arrival of the @entity13 , a train driver said			1
fire alert : a driver smelled smoke on a train at @entity9 resulting in the part closure of the central line at least four fire engines and the @entity21 arrived at @entity9 station , and the central line service between @entity7 and @entity24 did not reopen until 10am , with severe delays remaining on the line			1
a number of passengers at @entity9 were forced to wait in the dismal weather for buses to get to their destinations			1
the fire alert meant there was no service for a large part of the @entity37 , and on the branch of the line that remained open there was severe delays			1
a @entity41 ( @entity41 ) spokesman said this morning : ' the suspension is due to a train being taken out of service at @entity9 after the driver reported smelling smoke			2
' this has been investigated and all passengers left the train and station without reported problems			2
' station announcers at @entity54 told passengers there were reports of a fire on board the train			1
not in the rain ! passengers were forced to wait in the bad weather for replacement buses to their destinations @entity41 advised @entity67 spectators to use other tube and main line services to reach @entity4 , including the @entity71 's jubilee line , the @entity72 and the @entity73			1
to add to the @entity67 travel problems , rail services in and out of @entity7 main line station were disrupted due to an overhead wire problem between @entity78 and @entity79 in @entity80			2
this was affecting travellers on services run by the @entity85 and @entity86 train companies			0
the problems around @entity7 come on another busy day for public transport as the first weekday evening football match takes place at @entity91			2
this is only one of a number of @entity67 events taking place in the capital , with @entity41 ( @entity41 ) advising that @entity97 is expected to be exceptionally busy throughout the day			0
final destination : many people were struggling to get to the @entity2 in @entity4 to watch the @entity100 @entity41 said people were heeding advice to avoid @entity97 if @entity103 added that while @entity105 were up 4 per cent yesterday , road journeys in @entity97 were down by 20 per cent			2
@entity97 ’s @entity106 , @entity107 , said : ' public transport in general , and the jubilee line in particular , will be exceptionally busy today as spectators make their way to events at key @entity67 venues across the capital			0
struggle : passengers travelling to the @entity118 ' 3 - 2 hockey victory over @entity119 earlier this morning will have been pushed to make the event on time ' we are very grateful to customers for following our advice to avoid @entity126 station and for major businesses who are enabling their staff to work flexibly during the @entity100			2
' our advice to all users of the transport network continues to be to plan ahead , avoid hotspot areas , and leave plenty of time for your journey			0
' one passenger , who was forced to wait for a bus in the pouring rain to get to work , described the situation as ' absolute chaos '			1
she said : ' the train was packed to capacity as there were lots people on the way to the @entity67 , including people in the @entity100 uniform			0
coping : culture secretary @entity151 claims the transport network in @entity97 is ' coping incredibly well ' with the @entity67 ' it stopped initially for about 10 minutes and then we were told it was suspended at @entity9 due to a fire alert			2
' so many families with young children who were not from @entity159 were panicking about how to get to @entity4 and could n’t work out the best route			0
' people were queuing in the pouring rain and the local cab rank was full of ticket - holders desperately trying to get to the olympic park			1
not a good impression for @entity97 ! ’ the central line was not the only section of the @entity169 to suffer problems			1
@entity172 1,2 & 3 station was closed for around 20 minutes due to yet another fire alert			0
culture secretary @entity151 claimed that the transport network has ' coped incredibly well ' , despite the central line grinding to a halt earlier for three hours			1
he said : ' the central line is up and running			1
' it 's a totally normal feature of @entity97 's transport network which , let 's face it , this is the first @entity169 in the world - something we are very proud of - but ( it is ) also something that gives us challenges			0
' but the question is how do people cope ? did people get to the @entity2 on time ? did people get to their events on time ? ' systems were put in place ... and the systems worked			2
overall things are very much on track at this stage of the @entity100			0
' he said the ' real success ' of the @entity100 was that fears of the capital 's transport grinding to a halt had not been realised , adding that it ' coped incredibly well '			0
the @entity207 union claimed that a likely cause of the closure is @entity9 train 's brakes seizing up he added : ' the reason it has coped is because @entity214 have listened to the messages , we 've got lots of people who are working from home			0
' actual overall traffic numbers on the transport network are four per cent up compared to a normal summer , but it 's working extremely well			0
' meanwhile the @entity207 transport union called for an immediate investigation into ' the real impact of cuts to fleet maintenance schedules ' following the central line incident			1
the union claimed that the likely cause of today 's part - closure are the @entity9 train 's brakes seizing up			0
this afternoon there were minor problems on the @entity71 , as a signal failure led to minor delays on the @entity73 - another link to the @entity2			0
a more significant worrying for @entity67 organisers is this afternoon 's closure of the @entity241 - the high - speed games rail service - between @entity243 and @entity245 stations			0
the service was suspended for around two hours , and spectators - depending on where they were travelling from - were forced to use the @entity85 trains , get either underground services to @entity251 or overground services from @entity7 this afternoon in order to get to the events on time			1
there was severe delays between @entity4 and @entity258 , but normal service has since resumed .			0
