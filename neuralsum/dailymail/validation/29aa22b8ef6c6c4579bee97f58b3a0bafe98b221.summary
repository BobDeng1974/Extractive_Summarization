the poky room the couple were pictured in last week , albeit with an oven and hob , was revealed by a family friend to mainly used for ' tea and quick snacks '			2
the revelation opened up the @entity1 leader to claims that he was trying to make his family life look more humble than it is , even though his home is reputed to be worth £ 2.5million			0
and ' two kitchens ' @entity7 invites unwelcome comparisons with the controversy over @entity54 for having ' two @entity55 '			2
mr @entity7 denied choosing to be filmed in the smaller kitchen because it was less imposing			1
' the house we bought had a kitchen downstairs when we bought it , ' he told the @entity62 ' and it is not the one we use			0

' surely that ca n't really be @entity7 and @entity38 's kitchen ? all that lovely huge , fancy house , and that is where they do their cooking ? ' i hope for their sake that it 's actually their utility room , and that some bossy spin doctor has shoved them in there to make their £ 2million - plus townhouse in @entity134 's trendy @entity133 look less fabulous and to bolster @entity7 's man - o ' - the - people image			1
' in his @entity20 card last year , mr @entity7 posed with his wife and children in what appeared to be a larger kitchen mrs @entity141 , a child actress - turned - barrister , is expected to make a series of high profile appearances in the run - up to polling day yesterday this prompted @entity87 , the @entity149 political commentator and family friend , to come to the @entity151 's defence – by revealing his actual kitchen is ' lovely '			1

' last night @entity96 mp @entity169 said : ' clearly there 's no cost of living crisis for ' @entity173			0
' it 's a bit rich lecturing people about poverty from his £ 2million mansion			0
