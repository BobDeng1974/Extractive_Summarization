how i felt for the elegant @entity1 and @entity2 at the @entity4 ceremony on sunday			1
both arrived in teetering @entity7 heels , and both left in bare feet , clutching their heels in their hands			1
i 'd hazard a guess that , however glamorous the after - show parties , they could n't wait to get home and soak their aching , swollen feet			1
for the fact is , after a certain age high heels can feel as painful as someone sticking hot pins into the soles of your feet			1
sore point : @entity2 ditched her heels at the @entity4 @entity1 stands tall on the red carpet ... but also left without her heels on i should know : i may still make my living as a model , but these days you 're more likely to find me in a pair of moccasins or my bare feet than you are in a stiletto			1
when i do wear heels , i prefer to only wear them to dinner , where i 'll be sitting down most of the time			1
it 's funny really , because in my 20s i practically lived in heels			1
my young feet just seemed tougher than they are now			2
i 'm in my 60s now and these feet have been around a long time			1
for me , my 50s was the decade when my tolerance for heels faded			1
i 'm in good shape and , at 8st 3lb , i 'm still the same weight i was in my 30s , but as you get older the weight of your body shifts somehow			2
standing in heels just felt increasingly unnatural , and increasingly uncomfortable - something i 'm now unwilling to tolerate			1
beauty is pain : @entity55 is a fan of heels but hates how sore they can make her feet it does n't help that heels have , year on year , got ever higher			1
but do n't get me wrong - i think heels make most women look great			1
we all want to make our legs look the best they possibly can , and there 's barely a woman alive whose legs do n't look longer and leaner in a high - heeled shoe			2
so if you 're an older lady like me who wants to stand tall occasionally , how can you wear heels late into the night ? lucky for you , i have some top tips on how to make high heels wearable , gleaned from my years of working in fashion			1
i 've slipped enough times over the years to know the peril of a too - smooth sole , so every time i buy a new pair i take a pair of scissors or a piece of sandpaper to the bottoms to roughen them up			2
in my catwalk days , i even used to spit on the soles of shoes before i ventured down the runway			2
another of my girlfriends uses a particularly tacky hairspray			2
anything to give them a bit more grip			2
i like to give my shoes a test drive once i get home , no matter how silly it feels to be walking round in stilettoes in your pyjamas			2
that way you can work out which bits of the shoe rub your feet			2
then you stick fabric plasters on the painful bits of your feet , briefly soak them in water before slipping straight back into your shoes and walking around again			2
strutting her stuff : @entity55 has picked up some tricks on walking in heels from her years as a catwalk model this will let your shoes mould and stretch out over the expanded damp plaster area			1
when you do wear your shoes next , they should n't rub			1
if you 've got a long night on heels ahead of you then warm up beforehand - standing on a four - inch heel is like a workout for legs			1
hamstring stretches and ankle rotations can help prepare your legs for what 's coming			2
for me , it 's pretty much a habit - i do it most of the time while i 'm sitting down			0
the great news , of course , is that if you 're out to dinner you can do some under the table and no one will be any the wiser			0
wobble when you try to walk your heels ? if you 're not wearing open - toed shoes , why not tape your third and fourth toes along from your big toe together ? this will keep foot muscles aligned , which allows the ball of your foot to be much steadier			1
spray your feet with deodorant beforehand to stop sweating and increase friction , which will help avoid those dreaded blisters			0
another top tip is to use a nail file to rub away any rough edges inside your shoes and coat them with a thin layer of @entity162			0
this will avoid any nasty sharp edges rubbing and causing you pain or blisters later on			0
if you do develop blisters , then soak your feet for ten minutes in a warm bath with @entity170 salts			0
tip : soaking feet in @entity170 salts can toughen up the skin it will toughen up the skin and the salt also acts as an antiseptic , killing bacteria and reducing your chances of developing an infection			0
some people use warm black tea to do the same , but that seems to me a waste of a good drink			0
one thing i do if i get home and my feet hurt a bit is to take my hand and place it between each toe to separate them out , particularly if i ’ve been wearing heels with a very pointed toe			1
it seems to relax them			0
i ’m also a fan of @entity197 , an anti-inflammatory gel , to soothe aches and pains			0
buy rubber grips to stick on the soles of your shoes , even your fanciest ones			1
they cost very little - i buy them in bulk online , although you can get a cobbler to fit them - and i find that sticking one to the widest part of my shoe helps give me more stability			0
@entity7 would be horrified if he knew , of course , as he is known for his stylish red soles			0
but they 're on every single shoe i own			0
always find your shoes feel tight by the end of the evening ? use a man 's shoe tree to stretch them out			0
this should provide a little extra wriggle room			0
do n't be scared of cushioning			0
the padding on the skin of your feet gets thinner with age , which is why the older you get , the less tolerant your feet are to wearing heels			1
i use stick - in foot cushions to give extra support , and also to stop my foot from sliding forward in your shoes			0
and while they 're not exactly sexy , cushioned tights can help , too			1
@entity240 do a decent range			0
i also find shoes with a platform sole much more comfortable than thin ones			0
you need to spend time finding the right heels for you - see it as a project			1
never ever buy shoes on the spur of the moment , because they 'll rarely be right once you get them home			0
i always go shoe shopping in the afternoon , when i 've been on my feet for a few hours and they 've swollen a little			0
that way you wo n't find that your shoes get tighter as the day goes on .			0
