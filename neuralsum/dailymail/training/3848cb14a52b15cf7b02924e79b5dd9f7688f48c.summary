dignified and solemn , and a display of all the ceremony that @entity4 could muster , sir @entity1 ’s state funeral 50 years ago was the country ’s epic farewell to its revered wartime leader			1
but @entity10 courtiers were initially opposed to giving such an honour to a mere ‘ commoner ’ , previously unpublished official papers reveal			1
their concerns have come to light as @entity4 prepares to mark the 50th anniversary of the funeral , which took place on january 30 , 1965			1
right , guardsmen carry the prime minister 's coffin official documents in the @entity24 in the @entity25 show that @entity27 representatives first raised their concerns in 1959 – just as civil servants were beginning to plan the event			2
a record of a ‘ @entity31 ’ which took place on june 23 that year states : ‘ it was clear that @entity35 and the @entity10 representatives did not appreciate the vast scale on which this occasion is likely to develop – at any rate as regards the lying in state			2
in this they were considerably influenced by the theory that the funeral of a commoner must in all respects be on a smaller scale than that of a royal person			2
’ the same document also refers to a proposal to include @entity52 and @entity53 troops in the event alongside representatives of the police , civil defence and @entity58 forces			0
it states : ‘ opinion seemed to be against this , partly on the grounds that the procession must not be larger than that of a reigning @entity65 and partly because it would be difficult to know where to stop			0
’ at one point it was even suggested that prince @entity69 should act as one of the pallbearers			0
news of the @entity10 ’s concerns will surprise many because the @entity74 was known to have been close to sir @entity1 , who was prime minister when she came to the throne in 1952			1
sombre : crowds gathered in @entity78 on 30 january 1965 to pray for the great wartime leader ceremony : attended by dignitaries from 112 countries – a record – it was the largest state funeral to date mourning : the @entity69 and @entity74 led other members of the @entity86 in @entity87 's historian @entity88 , the author of the book @entity90 , said it was quite possible that the @entity74 herself had not been aware of the opposition			1
he said : ‘ it is interesting that @entity10 did n’t want @entity1 ’s funeral to overshadow @entity27 funerals			1
on one level you can see their point a bit			0
but this is n’t necessarily the @entity74 herself – it sounds like courtiers , who are often more conservative than the @entity65			0
‘ the very fact that the @entity74 went to the funeral of a commoner was a complete break with precedent			2
’ the files show that preparations for @entity1 ’s funeral were revised seven times in the years leading up to his death and that the last revision occurred just a month before he died on january 24 , 1965			1
tributes : lord @entity115 , @entity116 and the @entity117 at @entity1 's grave dignified : crowds gathered as the coffin is carried up the steps of @entity122 in @entity123 respects : queues outside @entity126 in @entity127 , @entity128 , where @entity1 was buried officials spent a great deal of time planning what to do in the event of sir @entity1 dying abroad			1
the files show that the @entity136 was charged with bringing @entity1 ’s body home in the event of him dying in @entity52 , @entity139 or @entity140			2
in any other country , the @entity141 would have been responsible for repatriation			0
in the event , he died in his @entity123 home			0
attended by dignitaries from 112 countries – a record – it was the largest state funeral to date			1
the former prime minister ’s body lay in state for three days in @entity154 and more than 300,000 people waited to pay their respects			0
silent crowds lined the street as the cortege made its way from @entity161 to @entity122 and dockers bowed their cranes as the coffin was carried down the @entity165			0
last night , @entity10 declined to comment .			0

death of sir @entity1 was marked with a dignified state funeral
but courtiers were initially opposed to giving honour to a mere commoner
concerns come to light ahead of 50th anniversary of the funeral next week
