by @entity0 last updated at 8:36 pm on 17th january 2012 she is famous for piling slabs of butter and glugs of cream into any - and every - recipe possible			2
but now @entity7 has revealed that such a rich diet does not come without consequence - as she has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes			1
the chef , 64 , was diagnosed with the condition three years ago , but kept it quiet as she did not want to ' let diabetes stand in the way of enjoying my life ' , she told the @entity18			1
it is a result of the body not producing enough insulin or failing to use it efficiently , allowing excess sugar to build up in the blood			2
it can be managed by making lifestyle changes , such as exercising more and lowering blood sugars by altering the diet			0
it might come as little surprise that the condition has affected a chef whose signature dishes include bacon , egg and a burger between a doughnut			1
and in an interview with the @entity18 last year , the mother - of - two revealed she could never live without butter or her deep - fat fryer			1
but speaking about her diagnosis , the ' queen of @entity22 cuisine ' said people should take her recipes with a pinch of salt			1
' i 've always encouraged moderation , ' she said			1
' people see me cooking all these wonderful , @entity22 , fattening recipes ... it 's for entertainment			2
people have to be responsible			0
' love of food : @entity7 has said the one food she could not live without is butter speaking with @entity69 , @entity7 revealed how she told @entity71 to exercise the same sort of responsibility			1
' like i told @entity71 , " honey , i 'm your cook , not your doctor , " ' she said			0
' you have to be responsible			0
' type 2 diabetes is a long - term condition caused by too much glucose , a type of sugar , in the blood			0
it is often associated with obesity			0
in those with the condition , the body is unable to break down glucose into energy as there is either not enough insulin to move the glucose , or because the insulin that is there does not work properly			0
the symptoms , such as tiredness and weight loss , can be controlled by eating a healthy diet and monitoring the blood glucose level			0
insulin medication , usually in the form of tablets , also controls the condition			0
around 25 million in the @entity105 have diabetes , with around 90 per cent having type 2			2
when asked if her high - fat recipes can lead to diabetes , she said : ' that is part of the puzzle			2
' she added that there are other factors , including genetics , lifestyle , stress and age			0
to deal with the condition , she is ' making lifestyle adjustments , including lightened - up versions of her favorite recipes '			2
the @entity125 chef is also taking @entity126 , a once - daily , non-insulin injection			2
' i am here today to let the world know that it is not a death sentence , ' she added			0
although it was rumoured @entity7 had the condition in april 2010 , this is the first time she has confirmed it			1
in 2010 , @entity7 earned just under $ 10 million from her television shows , recipe books , endorsements , retail sales and speaking fees , based on figures by @entity141			1
it suggests she could have earned around $ 30 million in the time since she was diagnosed			1
type 2 diabetes is an ever - growing problem in the @entity105 , with around 20 million people suffering from the condition			2
some of @entity7 's peers have questioned her judgement in keeping her own diagnosis quiet			1
signature dish : one of @entity7 's recipes is a @entity155 's @entity154 that features doughnuts in place of buns , bacon , a beef burger and a fried egg fellow chef @entity163 told @entity164 : ' when your signature dish is hamburger in between a doughnut , and you 've been cheerfully selling this stuff knowing all along that you 've got type 2 diabetes , it 's bad taste if nothing else			1
' according to the @entity174 , @entity7 is said to be under doctor 's orders to steer clear of high - calorie foods			1
leading endocrinologist dr @entity177 said : ' diabetes can be deadly because it increases your risk of heart disease , kidney failure and stroke			0
' and type 2 diabetes can be directly related to obesity , which is reaching epidemic proportions in this country			0
' a family friend told the @entity190 : ' when @entity7 was diagnosed with diabetes i think she was worried that if her secret got out , it would make her look like a hypocrite			1
' ironically , the very thing that made her rich and famous turned her into a poster child for what could happen if you follow in her footsteps			0
' see below for videos			0
