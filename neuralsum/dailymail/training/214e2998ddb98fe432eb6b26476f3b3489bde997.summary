the one in three local authorities that responded to a nationwide survey revealed that they had paid out £ 4.8million after claims by drivers following two harsh winters			1
with data lacking from two out of three councils , this means the compensation bill for this period could well be up to £ 15million			2
cash - strapped councils are paying out million of pounds in compensation to drivers who claim their vehicles have been damaged by potholes @entity26 alone has spent more than £ 630,000 of taxpayers ’ money since 2010 on 3,650 payouts to motorists for vehicle damage caused by neglected roads and potholes			1
@entity34 issued freedom of information requests to 434 city , district , borough and county councils			0
some 143 responded with at least one piece of data , while 291 are either yet to respond , said that they did not keep the data , or that they were not responsible for road maintenance in their area			2
since 2010 , more than 54,000 compensation claims have been made to the councils in @entity49 that supplied figures to the survey			1
warning : the combination of a wet summer and a cold winter has particularly harmed road surfaces the claims ranged from potholes ruining wheel rims to punctured tyres and damaged suspension between 2010 - 11 and 2011 - 12			1
the combination of a wet summer and a cold winter has particularly harmed road surfaces , with potholes forming after water seeps down below the road surface and freezes , loosening the asphalt			1
according to the data , the average repair bill is £ 132 , with some claims as high as £ 3,000			2
at the same time , the average cost of repairing a pothole is around £ 50 , meaning the amount paid out by councils in compensation could have been used to repair more than 96,000 potholes			0
road maintenance is severely under - funded with estimates that just £ 17 per driver is spent on maintaining road surfaces and fixing potholes – amounting to 11 per cent of the annual road tax bill			1
@entity84 , managing director of @entity34 , said : ‘ the past two harsh winters caused significant damage to the @entity49 ’s roads , which has not been fully repaired yet			0
‘ cuts in road maintenance funding mean that local authorities face very difficult choices on the roads they prioritise for repair			0
motorists should protect themselves by keeping an eye out for potholes and keeping speeds down , particularly in wet weather when holes may be filled by rain			0
