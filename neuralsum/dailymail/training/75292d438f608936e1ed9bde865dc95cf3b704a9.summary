every dementia patient in the country can expect to suffer poor care at some stage , a damning report warns			1
it says an astonishing nine in ten care homes and hospitals fail to provide the proper treatment			1
the @entity10 review found widespread neglect , lack of care , poor training and failings in communication			1
poor care : most of the 400,000 elderly in @entity19 ’s care homes have dementia , as do 40 per cent of those in hospital ( picture posed by model ) the health watchdog ’s report concluded starkly : ‘ this unacceptable situation can not continue			1
’ most of the 400,000 elderly in @entity19 ’s care homes have dementia , as do 40 per cent of those in hospital			1
despite the huge scale of the problem , thousands of health and care professionals are failing to deal with the issue adequately , the @entity10 found			1
inspectors visited 129 care homes and 20 hospitals across @entity38			1
they found that 90 per cent had some aspect of poor or inconsistent care			1
they wrote : ‘ it is likely that someone living with dementia will experience poor care at some point while living in a care home or being treated in hospital			1
’ many staff fail to carry out basic checks properly , they found , so often they do not pick up their patients ’ essential needs			2
focusing on improvements : health secretary @entity53 ( above ) said there can be ' no excuse , and no hiding place , for poor care within our @entity57 ' fifty - six per cent of hospitals and 29 per cent of care homes failed to assess fully the needs of those with dementia			1
pensioners in parts of the @entity19 may have to spend up to £ 170,000 on care before they qualify for government help with the bills , a study has found			1
last year the @entity70 announced a £ 72,000 cap on care costs from 2016 , to stop people being forced to sell their homes to fund it			2
once they have paid £ 72,000 , the government is meant to help with any further costs			0
but the @entity78 found that when a person ’s care spending is calculated – to see whether they have passed the threshold – food , living expenses and extra bills beyond basic care do not count			2
it means people will pay up to £ 100,000 more than the @entity76 said , and many will never qualify for help			0
the average cost will be £ 140,000 , the report said			0
but a postcode lottery means it will be more in some areas – £ 170,000 in the @entity95			0
a @entity97 spokesman said the cap will protect people from ‘ catastrophic care costs ’			0
patients ’ mental , social and emotional health was also neglected , with 42 per cent of hospitals and 34 per cent of care homes failing to deliver consistent care			1
inspectors also discovered a major communication breakdown when patients are transferred from a care home to hospital			2
with many patients unable to tell doctors and nurses their needs , the elderly were in some cases left without pain relief for hours			0
some hospitals had lost patients ’ health documents or were not aware they had dementia			2
in other cases , nurses phoned care homes for extra information , only to find the care staff had no knowledge of the patients ’ needs or could not access the information			1
one distraught daughter of an elderly patient told the @entity10 report , cracks in @entity133 : ‘ the professionals we encountered had very little knowledge on dementia and of my mother ’s needs			1
at times we were made to feel that she was invisible ’			0
another said : ‘ doctors need reminding that most of the time the person involved has been a pillar of the family			0
’ last night @entity145 , @entity38 ’s chief inspector of adult social care , called for a much more consistent approach to dementia care			1
she said : ‘ people living with dementia , their families and carers have every right to be treated with respect , dignity and compassion			0
every dementia patient in the country can expect poor care at some stage , the reports said			2
stock image used problems : fifty - six per cent of hospitals and 29 per cent of care homes failed to assess fully the needs of those with dementia ( picture posed by models ) ' our review found some great care , delivered by committed , skilled and dedicated staff			1
but this is not the case everywhere or even within the same service			0
’ nearly a million elderly men in the @entity19 are living in isolation and the number is set to soar , a charity warned yesterday			2
older men are far less likely than women to have contact with the outside world and many speak to their children less than once a month , a study for @entity184 found			0
the number of lonely men will rise by more than half to 1.5million by 2030 , it said			0
health secretary @entity53 said : ‘ there can be no excuse , and no hiding place , for poor care within our @entity57 - we are focusing on improving the lives of dementia patients and their families as never before			2
’ charities said the report confirmed years of anecdotal evidence			0
@entity206 , chief executive at @entity207 , said : ‘ with a staggering 90 per cent of the care homes and hospitals inspected found to have aspects of variable or poor care , this report highlights the plight that many people with dementia face			1
many people are rightly worried about having to move into care			0
’ @entity218 , whose 89 - year - old mother @entity219 suffered terrible abuse at her care home in @entity222 , @entity223 , said she was not surprised at the @entity10 ’s findings			2
‘ it ’s been two years since my mum was abused and yet nothing ’s changed , ’ said @entity225 , 59			0
‘ the whole system is flawed			0
’ @entity230 , former director general of over- 50s campaign group saga , said : ‘ we would not treat children in the way we treat older people			0
' and the impact is not just on the patients themselves , it is on the families who have to cope with the consequences of an illness that is becoming more prevalent			0
