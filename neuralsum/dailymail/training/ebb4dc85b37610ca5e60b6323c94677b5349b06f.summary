by @entity0 published : 03:10 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 08:29 est , 9 august 2013 the meteor fireball that crashed into @entity2 in february was part of a 656 - foot wide asteroid called 2011 @entity5			1
@entity7 astrophysicists analysed fragments of the meteor that were scattered across the @entity2 town of @entity11 , where the meteor landed , and claim it came from the large @entity15 asteroid that regularly crosses passed @entity16 as it orbits the sun. they added that the piece may have broken off because of the stress caused by the gravitaional pull of the planets and the sun , or could have been caused by the asteroid hitting into something else during its orbit			1
@entity7 astrophysicists analysed fragments of the meteor and claim it came from the @entity15 asteroid that regularly crosses passed @entity16 as it orbits the sun experts said the meteor that left a 50 - foot hole in a frozen lake on the outskirts of @entity11 , in the @entity37 , weighed around 100,000 tonnes and measured 55 feet in diameter this caused the fragment to separate off and plummet towards @entity16			1
the meteor fireball , also known as a superbolide , was seen over @entity11 in the south of the country near the border of @entity46 and around 900 miles east of @entity47			2
it exploded over @entity2 's @entity37 and is the biggest space rock to have hit earth in more than a century			0
the 10,000 tonne rock , measuring around 55 feet in diameter , created a huge hole in a frozen lake when it crashed into the ground			1
over 1,000 people were injured by the exploding rock and scientists managed to recover more than 50 tiny fragments of the meteor , allowing them to study its contents and origin			1
@entity65 scientists at the time said the shockwave caused by the crash was greater than 30 @entity70 nuclear bombs and was so powerful it travelled twice around the world			0
the @entity2 meteor hit the @entity16 just hours before an asteroid called 2012 @entity75 was spotted nearby but the two incidents were not found to be related			1
@entity77 , who led the expedition from @entity79 in february following the crash , said that 53 fragments of the meteor have been plucked from the ice - covered @entity81 in february divers searched the waters beneath the ice for traces of space rock but surfaced empty handed , leaving some experts questioning whether the hole was indeed formed by a piece of falling debris professor @entity92 and his brother @entity93 from the @entity94 identified 20 possible sources from a cluster of asteroids dubbed @entity11 asteroid family			1
they told @entity99 : ' the most probable parent body for the @entity11 superbolide is 2011 @entity5			1
under such conditions , the cluster can not be older than about 20,000 – 40,000 years			0
' however , the only way to confirm this theory , claims @entity92 , would be to go into space and take samples of the 2011 @entity5 asteroid			1
@entity110 scientists are also set to publish finding later this year that claim the meteor was made of a stony material called chondrite @entity115 asteroids are made up of boulders , dust and ice			2
professor @entity92 added that another similar incident is ' unlikely ' but smaller fragments might crash to @entity16 as the asteroid continues its orbit			2
the meteor caused widespread property damage in @entity11 city , with health officials saying that 46 of the injured remain hospitalised			2
the debris narrowly missed a direct and devastating hit on the industrial city which has a population of 1.13 million but spread panic through its streets as the sky above lit up with a blinding flash			0
service pieces of a meteorite are displayed in a laboratory in @entity138 after being recovered from near @entity139 in the @entity140			0
a total of 53 pieces have been brought for analysis to the university in @entity138 @entity145 of @entity65 's @entity146 said at the time : ' we would expect an event of this magnitude to occur once every 100 years			0
' he told the @entity152 : ' when you have a fireball of this size we would expect a large number of meteorites to reach the surface and in this case there were probably some large ones			0
' @entity77 , who led the expedition from @entity79 , said that 53 fragments of the meteor had been plucked from the ice - covered @entity81			1
the local governor estimated the damage at 1 billion rubles ( £ 21.5million ) and said he hopes the federal government will provide at least half that amount			0
the debris from the crash in february narrowly missed a direct and devastating hit on the industrial city of @entity11 , which has a population of 1.13 million , but spread panic through its streets as the sky above lit up with a blinding flash @entity179 , head of the astronomy department at the @entity47 - based @entity181 , said experts have drafted a program that envisages building powerful telescopes , including space - based ones , to warn against potentially dangerous asteroids , comets and other threats			2
as it raced through the sky , the 50 - foot wide chunk of space rock compressed the air ahead of it , creating the enormous temperatures that meant it exploded in a fireball somewhere between 18 and 32 miles above the ground at around 9.20am local time on 19 february			1
although some debris fell to earth , ‘ whipping up a pillar of ice , water and steam ’ and creating a 20 - foot - wide crater , the damage in nearby towns was actually caused by shockwaves created by the meteor breaking the sound barrier and then exploding			1
collectors from around the world will be keen to get hold of a piece of the meteor			0
film director @entity214 is a noted collector			0
in october a 9in piece of the @entity217 meteorite found in @entity218 in 1960 sold in @entity219 for $ 43,750 ( £ 28,200 )			0
astronomers have also revealed that the meteor could have hit @entity223 cities if it had hit at a slightly different time of day			0
the city of @entity11 , 900 miles east of @entity47 and close to the @entity46 border , took the brunt of the impact local residents said they witnessed burning objects in the sky of the @entity11 and @entity138 regions			2

experts say the meteor weighed 10,000 tonnes and was 55 feet wide
the rock created a 50 - foot hole in a frozen lake near @entity11
scientists have analysed more than 53 tiny fragments of the meteor
it is thought to have been part of a large @entity15 asteroid called 2011 @entity5
