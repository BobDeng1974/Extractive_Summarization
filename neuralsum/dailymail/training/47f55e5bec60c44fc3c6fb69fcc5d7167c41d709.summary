by @entity0 for @entity1 a unique nude calendar challenges perceptions of beauty with its twelve stunning models - who all have no hair			1
the 2015 charity calendar from @entity9 is themed around a girls ' country weekend			1
each photo features a country house , fast car , croquet , tea party - or even wellies - and of course beautiful bald models baring all			1
the light - hearted pictures also feature wigs in places one would n't normally find them			0
all of the models have alopecia and the calendar will raise funds for @entity40 @entity39			1
organiser @entity41 says : ' having had @entity40 for nearly three years , i 'm pretty comfortable in my own skin and am really open about @entity40 , mostly because i have a fantastic support network			0
' many people i have met really struggle with the condition and it becomes a barrier to doing what they want and being who they want to be			0
' education is really important , and in a moment of madness one evening i thought : " why not get our kit off and raise awareness of the condition ! " whether you have cancer , thinning hair , scarring or @entity40 , this calendar aims to showcase and raise awareness of lovely ladies ( and gents ) without hair ' there are many nude calendars out there , but i do n't think any can claim to be as challenging as this one was - for many of the girls , this was the first in public without their hair and they 're prepared to share that with the world ! amazing ! ' i am so proud of what has been achieved and hope it can play a small part in raising awareness of alopecia , and funds for @entity40 @entity39			1
' thanks to all our sponsors , particularly head sponsor @entity85 , who have made this project possible ! ' the calendar costs £ 10 and is available through @entity9 's website			1
hair loss is technically known as alopecia			2
there are two main types - areata , which is sudden , and androgenetica , which is the normal hair loss that men suffer and is sometimes known as male pattern baldness			0
alopecia areata is divided into three types , depending on how much hair is lost			2
in its most common form , it results in patchy baldness on the scalp , leaving areas of bare skin which is smooth to the touch			0
where the scalp loses all its hair , it is called alopecia totalis			2
sometimes all hair on the body and scalp is suddenly lost , a condition known as alopecia universalis			2
@entity40 is not physically dangerous and does not cause any scarring - but it can be devastating psychologically			0
alopecia can affect anyone : it occurs in males and females of all ages and races , although it tends to be more common in childhood through to early adulthood			0
some studies have found that women are more likely to be affected by alopecia than men			0
the calendar is on sale in a bid to raise awareness and funds for a @entity40 @entity39 twelve inspiring ladies have bared all , including bald heads , in the unique fundraising calendar , showing that bald is beautiful			1
