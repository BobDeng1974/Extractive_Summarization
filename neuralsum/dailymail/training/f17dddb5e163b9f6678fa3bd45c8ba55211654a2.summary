a woman has given @entity1 to her lesbian lover in an extremely rare case of female - to - female @entity1 transmission , according to the @entity5 ( @entity5 )			1
the 46 - year - old @entity7 woman ' likely acquired ' the virus from her @entity1 - positive female partner			1
such reports are incredibly rare , but the women were noted to have engaged in several risky behaviors and the diagnosed woman had stopped taking her medication in 2010			2
she also said she had not engaged in sex with a man for 10 years			0
the woman reported no @entity1 risk factors - besides sex with her 43 - year - old partner - such as getting tattooed , having multiple unprotected sexual partners or iv drug use			1
the report indicated that the newly infected woman 's @entity1 strain was a 98 percent genetic match with her partner 's			1
the study notes no other cases that can be classified as female - to - female @entity1 transmission with as much certainty , citing that in most other cases ' other risk factors almost always are present or can not be ruled out '			1
despite its rarity at the outset , the case 's particulars make it less shocking			0
' they described their sexual contact as at times rough to the point of inducing bleeding in either woman , ' reads the report			0
' they also reported having unprotected sexual contact during the menses of either partner			0
' report : the @entity5 report notes the rarity of this type of transmission , but also details the higher - risk behavior that the newly infected woman engaged in with her partner , whom she knew to be @entity1 positive the known positive partner was prescribed antiretrovirals in 2008 and reported that she stopped taking them in 2010 and was ' lost to follow up in january 2011 , ' @entity68 reports			1
when a patient is taking antiretroviral drugs the viral load in their blood is so low that it is very unlikely they will pass on the virus			0
however , if they stop taking the medication , the viral load will increase again and they are more likely to pass on the virus			0
@entity84 , acting chief executive at @entity85 , said : ' sex between two women carries an extremely low risk of @entity1 transmission			2
' however , in any sexual pairing , the risk of transmission increases when one of the couple has @entity1 but is not on treatment			2
' in this case , when the hiv - positive partner stopped taking @entity99 drugs in 2010 , it is likely the amount of virus in her blood increased dramatically			2
' modern drug treatments do nâ€™t just keep people with @entity1 fit and well ; they can also greatly reduce the risk of infection			0

@entity7 woman has been infected with @entity1 by her female partner
it 's very rare to find a *confirmed* case of female - to - female transmission
the couple engaged in ' rough ' sex making transmission more likely
