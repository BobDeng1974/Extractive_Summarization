@entity0 appears to have ignored the desperate pleas of @entity3 fans to strengthen his central defence and midfield in favour of bringing @entity7 to @entity8			1
the @entity10 striker will undoubtedly improve @entity3 's attacking options this season , but where does he fit in the @entity14 's preferred formation ? @entity7 , who will put pen to paper on a season - long loan deal for a fee of £ 12million before the transfer window closes , is n't a versatile player			1
he must play centrally and @entity21 knows that			0
the challenge now facing @entity3 's manager is fitting that talented quartet on the same pitch in a system that he not only likes , but which brings the best out of each individual			0
with his 3 - 5 - 2 failing to deliver a victory in four games so far this season , @entity21 may consider utilising a new formation to put his summer acquisitions to good use			1
the 63 - year - old has experienced success - most notably at this summer 's @entity64 with @entity65 - using three central defenders , but he lacks the necessary quality in that area of the pitch at @entity3 to persist with it			0
with @entity71 and @entity72 being more accustomed to traditional full back roles too , a 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 system looks a more likely option as @entity21 settles in at @entity8			1
@entity77 and summer signing @entity75 should fill the central defensive berths			0
going forward : @entity40 ( left ) and @entity41 ( right ) are two of @entity0 's attacking options going nowhere : club captain @entity38 appears to be a vital part of @entity21 's plans at @entity8 how @entity3 could line up with @entity7 that would give @entity3 a midfield three of @entity84 , @entity85 and big - money buy @entity87 - an attractive mix of pace , passing ability and defensive nous			1
that leaves four players - @entity7 , @entity38 , @entity94 and @entity41 - battling for three spaces at the top end of the pitch			1
unfortunately for the @entity98 , he appears to be the odd one out			0
as shown by his promotion to club captain , @entity38 is seen as a central figure by @entity21			2
he has played as a striker in each of @entity3 's three league games so far , but remains the most adaptable of the former @entity106 boss ' options			0
dropping the @entity108 skipper back into the no 10 role would give him the regular football he craves , while allowing @entity7 to play in his natural position - up - front alongside @entity94			0
it would , however , leave £ 37m @entity41 as a peripheral figure			0
@entity94 - like @entity7 - is at his most dangerous when played in the middle as the furthest man forward			2
the pair of them together have the potential to become the top - flight 's most dangerous partnership , helping negate any shakiness in the new - look back four with the promise of goals , goals and goals			0
whether @entity38 will be content to drop further back remains to be seen , but he may have no option given the excessive loan fee executive vice-chairman @entity127 has allowed to be spent on a man who was also a target for rivals @entity131 and @entity132 giants @entity133			2
prolific : @entity7 celebrates a goal for @entity136 against @entity137 during a @entity139 clash last season @entity141 completes dramatic @entity8 move odd one out : @entity41 ( right ) faces a battle to start for @entity3 after the arrival of @entity7 @entity41 left @entity145 in january in search of regular football but after struggling in saturday 's 0 - 0 draw with @entity149 , it already looks like he 'll have a fight on his hands to nail down a regular spot in @entity21 's first @entity153 @entity38 will play as captain , @entity94 is one of his manager 's most trusted players and you do n't sign one of the world 's best strikers to let him sit on the bench			1
with @entity163 also providing attacking thrust from midfield , @entity3 fans will be excited at the prospect of their revamped attack helping turn around a disappointing start to the campaign			2
unfortunately for @entity41 , the arrival of @entity7 could well mean he is no longer a part of it .			1

@entity7 will seal a season - long loan move to @entity3
the @entity136 striker will provide another attacking option for @entity0
his arrival will increase competition among @entity38 , @entity40 and @entity41
but the *highly* - rated former @entity183 forward looks certain to start
@entity21 could revert to a 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 formation after failing to win with 3 - 5 - 2
