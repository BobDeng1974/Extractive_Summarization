the @entity22 , or national assembly of the @entity5 , will have an opportunity to debate and give formal approval to the declaration when it meets in @entity27 next month			2
if there is no debate , the declaration will automatically come into force at the start of the meeting			0
members of the @entity34 are set to approve a proposal that will mean clergy who support or join the @entity1 or @entity2 will face disciplinary proceedings the effective proscribing by the bishops of the two political parties comes after the @entity22 gave final approval in 2012 to legislation making it ' unbecoming ' or ' inappropriate ' conduct for clergy to be members of a political party with policies and activities declared “ incompatible ” with @entity5 teaching on race equality			1
