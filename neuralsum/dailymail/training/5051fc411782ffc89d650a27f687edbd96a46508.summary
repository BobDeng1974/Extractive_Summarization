in the 1990 @entity3 film , the character of @entity1 is seen to have a talent for topiary , wielding his hands to create impressive sculptures in his new neighbourhood			2
but even these creations may be beyond his skills , with the best plant artists in the world gathering in @entity13 to show off their designs			1
gorillas , monkeys and a line of lemurs are among the entries in this year 's @entity20			1
one of the hundreds of exhibits at the @entity20 , which is taking place this summer in the @entity24 city the elaborate sculptures see horticulturalists letting their imaginations run wild , including rock pools and colour as well as creating the shape of creatures and people horticulturalists pick colourful foliage - and even paint the leaves - to complete their designs for the triennal competition a small deer appears to be dancing over the outstretched hand of a serene - looking woman made from cacti the horticulturalists battle it out to choose the best foliage to create living exhibitions - even painting the plants as part of the look			1
the triennial show began in 2000 with entries representing 35 cities from 14 countries			1
now , more than 100 cities from 25 countries are taking part and their entries will be on display in the @entity24 city until september 29			1
the stunning array of designs feature 22,000 plant species and cultivars in ten exhibition greenhouses and 30 themed gardens			2
these hulking gorillas are made from living and growing plants with their chests , hands , feet and faces moulded out of plastic as an addition to the design the competition may remind some of the spectacular creations made by @entity75 's @entity1 in the 1990 @entity3 film the theme for this year 's event was @entity79 , with entrants asked to incorporate something from their own country with an environmental concern such as an endangered species a family of monkeys is seen gathered on one mound where the artist has also brought in giant leaves to recreate the animals ' environment in @entity13 the theme for this year 's event is @entity79 , which asks competitors to design something that represents either nature in the city , endangered species or ecosystems , peace , positive action to help the environment or how man and nature are dependent on one another			2
@entity103 , president and ceo of @entity105 , said : ' i am absolutely thrilled that show has returned to make @entity20 blossom in 2013			1
' it goes without saying that the beauty of these original works by talented horticultural artists will not only captivate local @entity13 , but will also serve to attract visitors from around the world			0
' the endless 50ft designs - including a chameleon , frog , family of chimpanzees , water buffalo and herds of animals - will become a key attraction in the city for the summer			0
a line of lemurs with with their distinctive bright eyes has been carved from foliage for this entry , likely to have been submitted by @entity131 some artists created plants out of plants , with this entry showcasing tall flowers with large petals and leaves on their stem a frog looks to be basking in the spray from a water jet among the exhibits , which are on show until the end of september an chameleon 's tail curls as it hangs out on a tree branch with different leaves and paint picked to show its ever - changing colours @entity152 is a chance for the representatives from parks , gardens and green spaces around the world to exchange ideas as well as a competition and exhibition			2
all the entries must match up to standards for sustainable development and can promote an attraction within their cities			0
organisers predict that more than a million people will visit the displays , which are expected to bring in about $ 46million to the province of @entity171			0
they say that mosaiculture is different from topiary because artists create something new out of foliage and plants , whereas topiary involves pruning shrubs into shape			0
this entry brought the sea bed into a flowerbed with this fish 's bright orange fins among the greenery a horticulturalist designed a horse for this entry , with the large eyes and ear added on to the plants and foliage used for the head and mane a @entity197 cow creation looks a long way from home in the @entity13 display , looking like it 's enjoying bathing time in the water a resting shepherd and his flock sit atop a carpet of shale in this entry			0
contestants were asked to include examples of man and nature being interdependent as part of the @entity214 theme a loyal sheepdog joins its master for the design , incorporating leaves in many different shades for the shepherd 's trousers , cloak and hat artists were free to interpret the @entity214 theme from looking at how humans interact with nature to highlighting endangered animals or ways to protect the planet the wide eyes of this colourful creature peer out from long blades of grass in another entry , part of the mosaiculture competition in @entity13 some sculptures stand as high as 50ft depending on how ambitious the horticulturalists were with their subjects			0
