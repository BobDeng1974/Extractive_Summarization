@entity1 's former nanny has been revealed as a gay transgender man who made the future president laugh by trying on his mother 's lipstick			1
' @entity6 ' cared for the boy she called @entity9 when his mother @entity10 moved to the @entity12 capital of @entity13 in the late 1960s			1
openly gay , she would leave the house dressed in full drag - but was very careful that @entity1 never saw her			1
' he was so young and i never let him see me wearing women 's clothes , ' @entity19 said			1
' but he did see me trying on his mother 's lipstick , sometimes			1
that used to really crack him up			2
' cared for : @entity1 ( left ) was looked after by transgender man @entity6 ( right ) when he lived in @entity12 former life : @entity1 's former nanny @entity19 , who was born a man but believes she is a woman , on the left of this picture the nanny , who turned to prostitution after the family left and now lives in a slum , met the future commander - in - chief 's mother at a cocktail party in 1969			1
@entity10 , who had moved to the country two years earlier with her second husband @entity41 , sampled @entity6 's beef steak and fried rice and was so impressed that she offered her a job			1
it did not take long before she was also eight - year - old @entity1 's carer , playing with him and bringing him to and from school			1
@entity49 recalled they often saw @entity19 , who believes she is really a woman , leave the house in the evening fully made up and dressed in drag			1
but when the family left in the early 1970s , things started going downhill			1
@entity19 moved in with a boyfriend			1
that relationship ended three years later , and she became a sex worker			1
she said : ' i tried to get a job as a maid , but no one would hire me			2
i needed money to buy food , get a place to stay			2
' poverty : @entity19 has suffered taunts and beatings throughout her entire life			1
she now lives in a tiny hut in a @entity13 slum young leader : @entity1 ( circled ) as a child at his school in @entity13 , @entity12 it was a cat - and - mouse game with security guards and - because the country was still under the dictatorship of general suharto - soldiers			1
they often rounded up ' banshees ' or ' warias ' , as they are known locally , loaded them into trucks , and brought them to a field where they were kicked , hit and otherwise abused			2
@entity12 's attitude toward transgenders is complex			1
nobody knows how many of them live in the sprawling nation of 240million , but activists estimate seven million			2
because @entity12 is home to more @entity95 than any other country in the world , the pervasiveness of men who live as women and vice versa often catches newcomers by surprise			1
they hold the occasional pageant , work as singers or at salons and include well - known celebrity talk show host @entity104			0
but societal disdain still runs deep - when transgenders act in tv comedies , they are invariably the brunt of the joke			0
they have taken a much lower profile in recent years , following a series of attacks by @entity95 hard - liners			0
and the country 's highest @entity117 body has decreed that they are required to live as they were born because each gender has obligations to fulfil , such as reproduction			2
' they must learn to accept their nature , ' says @entity126 , a prominent @entity95 cleric at the influential @entity127			0
' if they are not willing to cure themselves medically and religiously ' they have ' to accept their fate to be ridiculed and harassed '			0
many transgenders turn to prostitution because jobs are hard to find and because they want to live according to what they believe is their true gender			0
in doing so , they put themselves at risk of contracting @entity141 and other sexually transmitted diseases			0
the raid that changed everything came in 1985			0
@entity19 and her friends scattered into dark alleys to escape the swinging batons			1
one particularly beautiful girl , @entity148 , jumped into a canal strewn with garbage			0
when things quieted , those who ran went back to look for her			0
' we searched all night , ' said @entity19 , who is still haunted by the memory of her friend 's face			1
' finally ... we found her			0
her body swollen , face bashed in			0
' @entity19 decided , then and there , to live the rest of her life as a man			2
she ditched her tight , flowery dresses , brocade vest and bras			0
now 66 , she said : ' i knew in my heart i was a woman , but i did n't want to die like that			2
so i decided to just accept it			0
i 've been living like this , a man , ever since			0
' several longtime residents of @entity1 's old @entity175 neighbourhood confirmed @entity176 had worked there as @entity1 's nanny for two years , also caring for his baby sister @entity178			1
@entity19 , who like many @entity12 goes by a single name , now lives in a closet - sized hovel in a tightly packed slum in an eastern corner of @entity13 , collecting and scrubbing dirty laundry to pay for food			1
she wears baggy blue jeans and a white t - shirt advertising a tranquil beach resort far away in a place she has never been			0
she speaks softly , politely , and a deep worry line is etched between her eyes			0
as a child , @entity19 was often beaten by a father who could not stand having such a ' sissy ' for a son			2
she said : ' he wanted me to act like a boy , even though i did n't feel it in my soul			0
' teased and bullied , she dropped out of school after the third grade and decided to learn how to cook			0
she made her way into the kitchens of several high - ranking officials by the time she was a teenager			0
and then she met @entity1 's mother			1
@entity6 now seeks solace in religion , going regularly to the mosque and praying five times a day			0
she said she is just waiting to die			0
she added that she did not know the boy she helped raise won the 2008 @entity213 presidential election until she saw a picture of the family in local newspapers and on tv			2
she blurted out that she knew him			0
as a child : @entity1 seen riding a tricycle in his youth ( left ) and with his mother @entity10 , who moved him to @entity13 after her divorce ( right ) her friends at first laughed and thought she was crazy , but those who live in the family 's old neighbourhood confirmed it is true			1
' many neighbours would remember @entity176			0
she was popular here at that time , ' said @entity230 , who still lives across the street from @entity1 's former house			1
' she was a nice person and was always patient and caring in keeping young @entity9			2
' @entity19 hopes her former charge will use his power to fight for people like her			2
@entity1 named @entity237 , the first openly transgender appointee , as a senior technical adviser in the @entity239 in 2010			2
for @entity19 , who 's now just trying to earn enough to survive each day on @entity13 's streets , the election victory itself was enough to give her a reason - for the first time in a long time - to feel proud			1
' now when people call me scum , ' she says , ' i can just say : ' but i was the nanny for the @entity248 ! '			0

@entity19 , 66 , cared for future commander in chief she called @entity9 in late 60s
offered job after she impressed @entity1 's mother with steak and rice
when family left @entity12 , she became a sex worker and now lives in a slum
