by @entity0 published : 19:54 est , 18 april 2012 updated : 11:08 est , 19 april 2012 this was the spectacular sight of the @entity4 transmitter lighting up the sky last night to commemorate it broadcasting its last analogue signal after 56 years			1
the 719ft - high tower shone like a beacon over south @entity9 as it marked the end of an era following the biggest digital switchover yet			1
the mother of all transmitters , which reaches a fifth of the country 's tv sets all by itself , will continue to broadcast signals - but only digital ones from now on			1
the 219m tall @entity4 broadcast tower is illuminated to mark the switch from analogue to digital television , bringing to an the end the 75 years that the antenna has been broadcasting the analogue signal			1
@entity28 and analogue transmissions both use radio waves , except that the former encrypts the signals so that only digital receivers can light up our homes with entertainment			1
broadcasting its first tv signal in 1956 , the 719ft - high @entity4 transmitter has been nicknamed ‘ @entity9 ’s @entity39 ’			1
and , despite being in rather less exclusive area than the @entity42 icon and strictly off - limits to tourists , @entity4 has possibly a greater importance than its 1,063ft rival			1
. without it a fifth of @entity48 would have no tv			2
there are 1,153 other television transmitters reaching 62 million people , from the @entity54 to @entity55			0
but @entity4 is the largest and most important			1
it was from here that colour television first took flight in 1967 , from here that @entity61 television was transmitted for the first time in 2009			0
the tower was built on the ruins of the original @entity4 , the @entity66 exhibition centre which burned down in 1936			1
the first transmission took place on march 28 , 1956			0
it was initially only used experimentally , with the @entity71 ’s main transmitter at @entity72			0
the only terrestrial station in the pre-digital era that is did n’t transmit was @entity75			2
but now , using coded uhf signals , it can transmit every digital channel			1
nevertheless , the end of analogue at @entity4 , which first transmitted a signal in 1956 , marks an important step in our history as modern technology replaces old			1
it would be particularly pertinent to the 100,000 homes were left with no television service at all in the switchover because they only had an analogue set			1
second and third sets which were not digitally connected will also have gone blank in households throughout @entity9 and the @entity94			2
people will now need to use services such as @entity97 , satellite and cable to carry on watching on these sets			0
although there has been a major publicity campaign , there were thousands of calls to the national helpline yesterday			0
when the signal to @entity106 was cut in the capital and surrounding areas earlier this month , there were about 35,000 calls to the body in charge of the process , @entity114			0
yesterday in the second part of the @entity9 switch , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity75 lost their analogue signal			1
an estimated 12million sets were involved in the switch which took place overnight			2
@entity97 viewers were also required to retune their set - top boxes and sets			2
some viewers took to @entity128 to admit their confusion , while others complained that the retuning had not worked			2
one said : ‘ why have i lost @entity115 and @entity106 from @entity97 ? i thought it was analogue that was getting switched off			2
’ turning the airwaves blue : the transmitter tower is lit up as part of last night 's celebrations millions of viewers also lost access to @entity141 , the world ’s first teletext service			0
this week ’s move marks the largest phase of the switchover with not only @entity9 but parts of @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 also included			2
many areas such as the @entity157 region have already completed the change			0
the switchover process began at midnight when @entity71 director general @entity160 turned off the switch at the @entity4 transmitter			1
well - connected : @entity164 journalist @entity163 inside the broadcast station at @entity4 back in the day : the control desk at the @entity71 's new @entity9 transmitter at @entity4 in march 1956 grand : the original @entity4 site before it become the broadcast site the south @entity9 landmark , now owned by @entity173 broadcast network operator @entity172 , was illuminated last night to mark the historic moment with 200,000 watts of lighting			1
tv broadcaster sir @entity176 pressed the red button illuminating the 219 metre high tower in a blaze of colour and marking the end of 75 years of analogue tv broadcasting in the region			1
he was joined by television personality professor @entity184 , radio and tv personality @entity188 and top programme maker sir @entity189 at a special ceremony under the transmitter , owned by @entity48 tv broadcast network operator , @entity172			2
switch off : 100,000 homes were left without television service after the switchover the guests recalled their greatest ever tv moments with sir @entity176 recalling the ' moment a man walked down a ladder and stepping on to the moon ' and professor @entity184 treasuring the @entity206 splashdown			1
amongst the celebrity guests , former @entity71 director general @entity207 shared his precious tv moment of @entity211 's goal in the 1966 @entity212 and his favourite comedy , @entity214			0
he said : ' this is a momentous moment in terms of choice of tv			0
we are all guilty of forgetting the range and quality of television we have in this country and it 's all got a lot better with the digital switchover			0
' former playschool presenter @entity227 recalled the time her stage show in the @entity229 was halted because tennis legend @entity230 was on the brink of beating @entity232 and the show stopped so they could watch the historic moment			0
host @entity188 quizzed sir @entity176 about his 60 years in broadcasting and how he introduced @entity236 to @entity106 , snooker to television with @entity239 , floodlit rugby league and the @entity241			0
professor @entity184 said : ' tv that 's watched by millions of people , so significant fractions such as 10 or 20 percent of the population , is overwhelmingly important			0
' the argument that 's often made is that in a digital world , with the @entity247 , you can just choose what you want to watch			0
but i do n't think that 's genuine choice really			0
' i think that the foundation of choice is that you see things that you would n't normally have watched			0
” video : sir @entity176 and prof @entity184 help to light up @entity9 's @entity4 transmitter			1

beacons of light shine over @entity9 to mark the end of the analogue era
@entity4 will still continue to broadcast signals - but only digital now
still confusion over switch as 100,000 homes were left with no tv service
