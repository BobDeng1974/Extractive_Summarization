@entity1 with daughter @entity23 after @entity5 was found guilty of attempted murder after enduring 86 operations and with a further 30 skin - grafts to go the 48 - year - old remains in chronic pain but says the thought of seeing her children one day happy and married keeps her going			1

some days , i just cry			0
' people stare at me and mock my appearance			0
it 's a life sentence for me , so why should n't it be for him			0
' @entity1 , who previously worked as a janitor first met @entity5 , 57 , while they were living in the same apartment block in @entity46 in december 2008			1
before and after : @entity1 was seriously disfigured in the attack carried out by her ex-lover @entity5 insisted that he did n't realise the sulphuric acid would have such devastating consequences after a brief conversation in the lift he asked her out for a drink and more dates ensued			1

she added : ' i was shocked and said we should just be friends - we had n't slept together and i was n't about to break up a family			0

at one point his wife found out about the tryst and threw him out but @entity5 returned to his family while continuing to meet with @entity1 in secret			1
it was only on a holiday in @entity70 in 2009 that @entity1 became aware of @entity72 's dark streak when he started talking about violent films that involved torturing women and when they returned home she refused to see him again			2
brave : @entity1 ( right ) with her lawyer @entity78 ( left ) said her former lover ' destroyed her life ' it was this event that triggered his increasingly obsessive behaviour and he was even spotted by locals wearing a t - shirt printed with a picture of @entity1 's face and the words ' i love you ' shortly after			1
she alerted the police , but they told her to move house and four - days later she was visited at her flat on suburbs of @entity96 by @entity5 who was disguised as a parcel courier			2
as soon as she answered the buzzer he splashed a container of acid all over her face and upper body			0
