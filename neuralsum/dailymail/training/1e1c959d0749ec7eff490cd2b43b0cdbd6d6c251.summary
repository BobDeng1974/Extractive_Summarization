by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:28 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 09:36 est , 18 november 2013 paying the jobless over-generous benefits does not make them happy , a new @entity3 - wide study reveals			1
researchers at the @entity7 also insisted that extra welfare does not make the unemployed lazy and less likely to look for work			1
instead motivation levels of those without a job are more likely to be affected by the way society views them			0
employment levels across @entity3 vary widely , in part as countries struggle with the impact of the eurozone crisis researchers at the @entity7 compared how unemployment affected people 's life satisfaction in all @entity25 countries and @entity26 , and found there was no over-riding trend			1
the well - being of jobless people is not affected by the level of benefit they receive , they found			2
dr @entity34 , of the @entity7 's @entity35 and political science , said : ‘ those who claim that greater unemployment benefits lead to less motivation for people to seek employment should think again - for most people , it is not the degree of state provisions that determines how they personally feel about the experience of being unemployed			1
‘ unemployment does not just result in a loss of income but also a change in social position - that is perceived differently in different societies			0
’ rates of unemployment vary across @entity3 , with many countries still struggling under the impacts of the @entity60 crisis			2
in the @entity62 , the unemployment rate has fallen to 7.6 per cent , closer to the 7 per cent target set by the @entity64 before interest rates could rise			0
but in @entity67 and @entity68 it remains at more than a quarter , and is around 17 per cent in @entity69 and @entity70			0
dr @entity34 the study used data from @entity73 and the @entity74 to examine how the jobless in different countries are motivated to find work			2
it found that some of the countries with the most generous benefits have the greatest loss in life satisfaction for their unemployed , and vice versa			1
for example , @entity85 and @entity86 are in the top 25 per cent for unemployment benefits expenditure yet have high levels of dissatisfaction in people without jobs			1
the reverse is true for @entity94 and @entity95 , which are in the bottom 25 per cent for benefit provision while their unemployed are among the least affected			0
the @entity62 is ranked in the mid 50 per cent for the level of benefits provided to the country 's unemployed and is ranked as 18th for the extent of loss in life - satisfaction of the jobless			1
jobseeker : being made more in benefits does not make someone less likely to find work , the study found ( file picture ) it was concluded that cultural and demographic factors have a greater impact on the lives of jobless people , such as having no job in a country that has a proportionally older population and fewer people at working age			2
other factors highlighted by the report as having a negative impact on personal well - being were high inflation levels and income inequality			0
the country with the highest level of dis - satisfied unemployed people was @entity130 , with a rate that was 50 per cent higher than second - placed @entity132			0
at the bottom of the table was @entity94 , which is also in the bottom 25 per cent for benefit provision , while @entity67 is in the top 25 per cent for benefits expenditure yet unemployed citizens remain relatively unaffected , with the country sitting above @entity94 in 27th position .			0

countries with most generous benefits have the greatest loss in life satisfaction for jobless , @entity3 - wide study *suggets*
@entity7 finds no link between welfare and wellbeing
@entity85 and @entity86 pay most benefits but have high dissatisfaction
