there will be a three - year racing programme ahead of 2017 , with some six @entity44 events between nations hoping to qualify for the showpiece match - off against the holders			2
' winning that event in @entity18 with a good group of guys was way more powerful than anything i had done as an individual , to share that experience , but standing there on the podium lifting the @entity4 , it did cross my mind that it would be much more fulfilling with a @entity12 team , and so that is the goal , ' @entity13 said during tuesday 's launch at the @entity62 in @entity63 , which was attended by the @entity64 , @entity64			1
' it is never easy , but it is about bringing together the right people who have built successful corporations , designed successful @entity4 boats , sailed on winning boats , brought the @entity2 to @entity12 - and we have those people			1
king of the sea : four - time @entity2 champion @entity13 will lead a @entity37 - based @entity4 team ' i know what it is like to be successful			1
all of us are here to win the @entity4 and we will do whatever it takes to achieve that goal			0
' i learned a great deal aboard @entity15 in @entity18 and i would not be challenging if i did not believe we have a real chance of winning this time			2
' for me , it is probably not the easy option , but it is the right option			0
' it is about righting a wrong and bringing the cup back to @entity12 waters for the first time ever			2
' our budget is around £ 80million , which is realistic to try to win , we do n't just want to take part			0
' we need to bring together the right talent in terms of designers , we have a fantastic core team and will be building the team out from here			0
asset : @entity103 @entity102 designer @entity101 has been linked to @entity22 there have been reports @entity103 designer @entity101 could come on board with @entity22 , whom @entity13 said would be a ' tremendous asset			0
' the @entity110 added : ' we have already started on that process of trying to learn from motor sport , specifically with some of the engineering challenges we have with these boats			0
' we have also seen cycling become very technologically based in their performance , @entity7 for example , the approach they have			0
' that is what we need to follow in their footsteps and need to be better in every department ( than our rivals ) , which these teams have done			0
' the @entity4 was first contested off the @entity129 back in 1851 and after the inaugural trophy was lost to the @entity132 ' boat , it has never been won back by a @entity12 yacht club			1
@entity13 said : ' this has been a childhood ambition since i was growing up down in @entity137 , watching the @entity12 team , backed by @entity139 , racing in the old 12 metres			2
' something just bit me and i had this burning desire and ambition to ultimately be part of a winning @entity145 team			0
' it was a fantastic experience with @entity15 last time , we have a lot of respect for them , also for @entity17 and all the other competitors , but ultimately we want to win this for @entity12			2
