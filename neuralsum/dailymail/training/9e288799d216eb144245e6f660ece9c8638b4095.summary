' if i take an example , the place where @entity64 citizen @entity168 ( @entity99 ) is being held is a reform institution			0
' but in february the @entity172 found that there were widespread and serious abuses of human rights to be taking place in @entity1			2
in a recent online post titled ' @entity178 ' , @entity179 , a @entity181 history lecturer , suggested that the absence of @entity0 could be @entity1 's attempt to change the subject from its human rights abuse but he later added that there are lots of rumors floating around , and ' most of them are probably wrong '			1

' @entity0 's disappearance from the public eye ' does not appear likely to shake the regime , but it reveals the vulnerabilities the regime faces ' , @entity216 said			2
last week , @entity147 addressed the @entity1 dictator 's mysterious disappearance , with a bizarre skit in which the cast mocked his claims that he is still in power but just ' hurt his leg '			0
