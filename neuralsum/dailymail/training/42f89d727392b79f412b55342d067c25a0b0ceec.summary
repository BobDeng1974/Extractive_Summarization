outspoken independent senator @entity0 wants an overhaul of the @entity3 citizenship oath , to include renouncing of @entity5 and in , arguably , her most controversial call yet , she wants the death penalty reintroduced			1
capital punishment officially ended in @entity9 in 1984 , when revoked by @entity9 but had not been used after 1967 when @entity10 was sentenced to death by hanging in 1967			1
but as debate rages over @entity15 's use of the ultimate punishment on convicted @entity3 drug - smugglers , @entity18 and @entity19 , ms @entity0 insists treason against this country should be punished in the most severe fashion			1
' in those cases the @entity3 laws are very clear			0
@entity3 citizens who take up arms against members of our @entity50 ( @entity50 ) are guilty of treason			2
strangely no @entity3 politician , including mr @entity54 , has been able to explain why the most serious of federal charges - treason or sedition , has not been laid against the hundreds of @entity3 citizens who have joined the fight with @entity40 or are assisting them back home in @entity9			2
i want to know why ? ' senator @entity0 asked			0
the senator has urged prime minister @entity54 to overhaul laws to take tougher action against would - be terrorists in @entity9 the one - time @entity66 politician believes revoking citizenship or trying to rehabilitate @entity40 fighters returning to @entity9 is a waste of time , and dangerous			2
' part of my solution to help defeat @entity40 is to re-introduce the death penalty as a sentencing option for @entity3 juries who find our citizens guilty of treason , ' she said , explaining that would be categorised by taking up arms against @entity3 military personnel			1
' putting terrorists and would - be terrorists in jail will only turn our prison systems into recruiting centres for @entity89 extremism			0
' we need to get rid of them permanently			0
mr @entity54 needs to support the reintroduction of the death penalty for treason and terrorism			2
' ms @entity0 also insists that @entity96 supporters in @entity9 found to have any sort of link to the militant groups across @entity100 and @entity101 , should immediately have their rights as an @entity3 citizen revoked			1
under @entity3 law currently ; citizenship can be removed " if a person commits a ‘ serious crime ’ at any time prior to the person becoming an @entity3 citizen , provided they are convicted for 12 months or more for that crime			0
however , this applies only to applications for @entity3 citizenship by conferral , not to those who acquired @entity3 citizenship automatically			0
however , revocation can not occur if ( it ) would render a citizen stateless ( without nationality )			0
" ms @entity0 also insists that @entity96 supporters in @entity9 found to have any sort of link to the militant groups across @entity100 and @entity101 , should immediately have their rights as an @entity3 citizen revoked			1

' we need to get rid of them permanently			0
mr @entity54 needs to support the reintroduction of the death penalty for treason and terrorism , ' @entity0 said ' our citizenship oath should clearly state that anyone wanting to become an @entity9 citizen is opposed to @entity5 , a theocratic , anti-democratic law which strips women and gay people of basic human rights , ' according to senator @entity0 ' at the very least , they should not be allowed to vote , stand for parliament or receive any government benefits until an official investigation establishes that they have not assisted our enemies in any way , ' she added			1
' if they are found to have assisted our enemies they must be charged with @entity152 and put in jail for up to 7 years			0
' she went further , calling for an overhaul of the @entity3 citizenship oath			1
' our enemies in @entity40 want to impose @entity5 on us and the rest of the world , ' senator @entity0 said			2
' our citizenship oath should clearly state that anyone wanting to become an @entity9 citizen is opposed to @entity5 , a theocratic , anti-democratic law which strips women and gay people of basic human rights			1
' the senator 's preferred version of the new oath , reads : ' from this time forward , under @entity166 , i pledge my loyalty to @entity9 and its people , whose democratic beliefs i share , whose rights , liberties and opposition to @entity5 i respect and whose laws i will uphold and obey			2
' she went on to claim that ' if immigrants , refugees or other prospective @entity3 citizens have a problem with swearing an oath to oppose @entity5 , then they can leave @entity9 , and go to a country which does tolerate an anti-democratic law and culture - that the @entity96 terrorists want to impose on us by force '			1
' it ’s clear cut , from now on , it ’s 100 per cent the @entity3 way or the highway , ' said senator @entity0 .			0

@entity0 has called for the death penalty to be reintroduced in @entity9 for acts of treason
she says anyone who takes up arms against @entity3 military personnel is guilty of the crime
capital punishment ended officially in 1984 when @entity9 revoked its use
