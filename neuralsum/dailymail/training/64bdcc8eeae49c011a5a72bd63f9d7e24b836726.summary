@entity0 , former @entity1 commander and deputy @entity3 first minister , is considering whether to accept the invitation the revelation that former @entity1 commander @entity0 may attend a state banquet hosted by the @entity8 sparked a furious reaction last night			1
the @entity11 politician is still considering whether to accept an invitation to the white - tie event at @entity14 next month			1
@entity15 refused to confirm that @entity17 ’s deputy first minister is on the guest list for the banquet , in honour of @entity3 president @entity21			1
@entity0 is also thought to have been invited to a reception , also at @entity14 and hosted by the @entity8 , a few days later			1
but former @entity24 chairman @entity23 , who survived the @entity1 bombing of the @entity26 in @entity27 in 1984 which left his wife @entity29 paralysed , said : ‘ were i the @entity8 , i think i would be looking very hard for a reason not to be inviting mr @entity0 to my home			1
’ @entity33 mp @entity32 , a former @entity34 colonel who also served in @entity17 , said : ‘ the @entity1 was responsible for killing and injuring many of my colleagues and , while i fully appreciate the need for conciliation , i feel this invitation is going too far			2
’ a former @entity41 member , who was involved in @entity44 ’s long - running and costly @entity43 inquiry , said : ‘ the thought of this former @entity1 commander walking into @entity14 makes me feel physically sick			1
people should remember what the @entity1 did and how many innocent lives have been lost			2
’ @entity50 , whose policeman son was gunned down by an @entity1 fugitive in @entity53 in 1992 , said : ‘ this invitation is absolutely disgusting			2
he should n’t even be allowed into @entity55			0
’ other critics pointed out that the @entity8 ’s cousin , @entity57 of @entity58 – who was also prince @entity59 ’s uncle – was murdered by an @entity1 bomb on his fishing boat in the @entity62 in 1979			2
however , some saw the invitation as a possible further step in the peace process			0
@entity68 mp @entity67 said : ‘ there are many in @entity17 who still carry the pain and the scars of the @entity1 and other terrorist organisations			0
opposition : @entity23 ( left ) said he ' would be looking very hard for a reason not to be inviting mr @entity0 to my home ' while mp @entity32 ( right ) said the invite was ' going too far ' ' but if the @entity81 movement is prepared to recognise the legitimacy of the @entity8 as @entity83 then that might be looked upon as some sort of progress			0
’ former army officer colonel @entity86 said : ‘ there will be some people who will be deeply upset but i believe this is a move which speaks of the power of reconciliation			0
’ @entity93 chairman @entity92 said : ‘ it ’s just a tragedy that so many people had to lose their lives before he [ @entity0 ] realised that violence was futile and the @entity1 campaign was doomed to failure			1
’ @entity0 , who met and shook the hand of the @entity8 in @entity103 two years ago , would need any acceptance of an invitation to be ratified by senior @entity11 officials			0
last night the party refused to discuss when that decision would be made			0
a @entity15 spokesman said : ‘ we would never announce in advance the invitees to state banquets			0
