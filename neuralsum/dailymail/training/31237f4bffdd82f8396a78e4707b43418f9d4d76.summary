by @entity0 published : 17:43 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 17:56 est , 22 may 2013 the sole adult afflicted by a mystery @entity4 - like illness that swept the small town of @entity6 , @entity7 , in late 2011 has told how her body ' hurt ' and her head would become locked to one side			1
@entity12 , 36 , joined eighteen high school students who were suddenly struck down by terrifying , undiagnosable symptoms which included severe twitching and shouting episodes			1
speaking for the first time since her recovery in a new documentary titled @entity21 's , airing tonight on @entity22 at 10pm et / @entity23 , ms @entity12 states : ' everyone kept on referring to , " it 's only affecting teenagers " , and it was n't			1
' my doctor said " everything that you 've ever suppressed in your whole life has just erupted like a volcano			2
" in october 2011 she started experiencing sudden head jerks followed by vocal tics			1
at one point she decided to leave work early in fear of losing her job			1
recalling her deteriorating condition , ms @entity12 says : ' if anybody touched me it would hurt even more			2
so i could n't be touched			2
' my head it actually stuck right here			2
my chin was on the back side of my shoulder			2
' ' my head it actually stuck			2
my chin was on the back side of my shoulder ' when news of the bizarre outbreak first surfaced it was thought to be caused by a condition prevalent in children , as all of the cases involved students from @entity70			2
however , when details of ms @entity12 ' situation emerged researchers had to come up with a new theory			2
as time went on and no direct cause or cure was identified , worry turned to fear , panic and suspicion , particularly as the wider world began to show an interest			1
and the new footage highlights this terror			2
' i do n't understand it - something is not right , ' one parent tells the camera			2
another suggests drugs may be involved , adding : ' it 's either completely unrelated or they 've all gotten into something			1
' debilitating : ms @entity12 said that her head would become locked ' on the back side of my shoulder ' one of the younger sufferers is seen insisting : ' seriously , why would we fake this ? ' the @entity22 film examines the various speculated causes of the @entity4 's - like tics , as well as the rising fear that something serious was being covered up			1
' there might be some sort of cover up , ' one man is heard suggesting			0
' whatever it is , it may be spreading			0
' another says : ' please , just tell us what this is and where it came from and how we can get rid of it			0
' and a woman 's voice is full of frustration as she tells the camera : ' stop lying to me and just tell me you do n't know what the hell 's going on ! ' in total , 19 patients came forward with @entity4 ’s like symptoms , which include uncontrollable facial and body twitching			1
' electric shock feeling ' : one young girl clutches onto the sides of a hospital bed as she convulses distressing symptoms : another sufferer can be seen in a hospital bed twitching as she awaits diagnosis at one point in the @entity22 program one patient is heard saying between tics : ' the electrical shock feeling that i get in my spine never goes away			1
' another , also visibly affected , says : ' i was always so active			0
i do n't feel like myself			0
the true cause of the illness is still a mystery , but the documentary explores different possible causes such as infections , environmental influences , conversion disorder and even @entity155			1
among those who have taken an interest in the case is environmental campaigner @entity159 , best known as the woman portrayed by @entity161 in the eponymous 2000 movie			0
she has suggested that a chemical spill from a train derailment in the 1970s near the site of the girls ’ school may be the cause			0
but doctors who have treated or tested the girls in @entity6 believe they are suffering from conversion disorder , or the twitching symptoms are possibly related to an infection			1
@entity4 's - like symptoms : the teenagers affected by the bizarre tics speak of their distress in the documentary , describing how their lives have changed mystery condition : all exhibit frequent twitches , some more extreme than others , as they speak			1
one girl says : ' i feel like people look at me and judge me ' more recently , @entity188 and @entity189 were being blamed for the mystery illness			1
doctors said that symptoms are being ‘ reinforced and magnified ’ because victims of the bizarre condition are uploading videos of themselves onto social networking sites to appeal for help			0
they argue that when other people in the town of @entity6 view the videos , they are unconsciously mimicking what they see and spreading it around			1
@entity203 , professor of neurology at the @entity205 , who has treated several of the patients , told @entity208 : ' it 's remarkable to see how one individual posts something , and then the next person who posts something not only are the movements bizarre and not consistent with known movement disorders , but it 's the same kind of movements			1
' this mimicry goes on with @entity188 or @entity189 exposure			0
this is the modern way that symptomology could be spread			0
’ school scandal : eighteen @entity70 students reported a mysterious outbreak of spasms and seizures researchers have also come up with a string of theories and believe teenagers may have been struck down by pediatric acute - onset neuropsychiatric syndrome , or pans , which is a kind of @entity234 linked to strep throat			1
other believe that @entity236 could be to blame , which is a disease that causes patients to sprout painful sores			0
some doctors have also suggested it could be a mass psychogenic illness which can be triggered by stress and is spread from unconscious mimicry of one another			1
dr. @entity245 , chief of neurology at the @entity247 in @entity248 , said : ' when one has a symptom , it can be reinforced and magnified with other individuals with similar symptoms			0
' that 's what 's going on with these girls			1
they are in a segregated small rural town in @entity259			1
they are a cohesive group			0
and this wildfire of symptoms takes control			0
' local hazard : environmental campaigner @entity159 has suggested that a chemical spill from a train derailment in the 1970s near the site of the girls ' school may be the cause during an angry meeting with school officials in february 2012 , parents asked why the soil around a natural gas well which had been dug on school ground had not been tested for contamination			0
' this could take years ! what are you doing to protect my kid ? what are you doing to protect these peoples kids ? ' said parent @entity284			0
' i 'm not looking for a lawsuit of any kind , i just want my daughter to get better , ' said @entity288			0
adding to the concern was that the wells were drilled using the controversial hydraulic fracturing method , also known as ‘ fracking ’			0
dr @entity293 of the @entity294 had earlier explained that tests had ruled out environmental factors as the cause of the disease			0
he also claimed that genetics , antihistamines or head trauma could be to blame .			0

in @entity22 's new documentary @entity21 that caught @entity4 's locals talk about their fear , panic and suspicion after undiagnosable illness struck the town of @entity6 , @entity7 , in late 2011
