by @entity0 published : 09:46 est , 12 june 2012 updated : 01:40 est , 13 june 2012 as the writer half of the @entity3 , he was famous for his meticulous word play and brilliant punchlines			0
and @entity6 did n’t stop at his own work – a recent discovery shows that he even took his pen to the limericks of celebrated poet and artist @entity12			1
in his copy of @entity12 ’s @entity14 , @entity6 has crossed out the last lines of a series of verses and replaced them with his own version			1
great minds do n't always think alike : @entity6 ( left ) crossed out lines from the limericks of @entity12 ( right ) to ' improve ' them amendments : the book ( left ) includes @entity6 's limerick ( right ) , dated november 2001 , which explains why he improved @entity12 's poems the 19th century author of @entity27 wrote limericks using the same word at the end of the first and last lines – to @entity6 ’s obvious frustration			1
he wrote at the start of the book : ‘ there was an old fossil named @entity12 , who ’s [ sic ] verses were boring and drear , his last lines were worse , just the same as the first ! so i ’ve tried to improve on them here			1
’ rival in rhyme : @entity12 , who died in 1888 the book , signed by @entity6 , is up for auction with a guide price of £ 1,500			1
he is thought to have made his amendments in 2001 , four years before his death at 76			0
other limericks he changed included : ‘ there was a @entity54 of @entity51 , who wept when the weather was murky ; when the day turned out fine , she ceased to repine , @entity50 of @entity51			0
’ @entity6 replaced the last line with : ‘ in fact , she became rather perky			2
’ he did the same with : ‘ there was an @entity61 of the @entity62 , who was sadly annoyed by a flea ; when he said , “ i will scratch it ” , they gave him a hatchet , which grieved that @entity61 of the @entity62			0
’ @entity6 changed it to : ‘ and he cut his leg off at the knee ’ – which also fitted @entity12 ’s illustration of a man wielding a hatchet next to a man ’s leg			1
however @entity6 , described by @entity75 as a ‘ master of the @entity78 language ’ , could not always find inspiration and next to the limerick ‘ there was an old @entity82 ’ , he wrote simply : ‘ impossible – no further rhymes			2
’ by the end he ’d clearly had enough because he changed the final verse to read : ‘ there was a @entity54 of @entity87 , who was sadly pursued by a bear ; when she found she was tired , she abruptly expired , and so do these rhymes – in despair ! ’ the book was found by chance among a job lot bought by collector @entity96 , 40 , of @entity97 , @entity98			1
it will be auctioned at the @entity100 near @entity101 , @entity102 , on june 21			0
changes : @entity6 's revision of ' there was an @entity106 ' scribble : @entity6 wrote an alternative ending to ' there was an @entity110 ' notes : ' there was an old person of @entity114 ' is one of more than 100 limericks revised by @entity6 widely considered to be the creator of nonsense verse , @entity12 was also an accomplished author , artist and illustrator			1
he was born into a middle - class family in @entity122 , @entity123 , in 1812 , but suffered ill health - including epileptic seizures - from childhood			0
@entity12 travelled widely throughout his life and eventually settled in @entity128 , @entity129 , where his body is buried			2
he briefly gave drawing lessons to @entity133 @entity132 , and he journeyed to @entity129 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 ( now @entity137 ) to perfect his art. he helped popularise the limerick when he published @entity14 in 1846			0
his most famous nonsense work , @entity27 , was published in 1867			0
a spokesman for the saleroom said : ‘ if one had to name @entity6 ’s comedy ancestors then the name of @entity12 would surely feature			1
' both were masters of comic word play			0
’ but he added : ‘ to modern day readers such as @entity6 ’s generation and ours , the limerick form has to end with a funny punchline in the fifth brand new line			2
‘ what struck @entity6 as odd was that @entity12 used the same rhyming word as the first line , making the limerick an anti-climax of non-humour			2
‘ i think @entity12 ’s more nonsensical treatment of the limerick form he invented was deliberate rather than second - rate			0
' they were , after all , published in his “ @entity14 ”			0
’ @entity12 ’s book , however , did contain at least one limerick of which @entity6 approved , and commented next to it : ‘ this is the first one i have ever seen that did n’t use the same word ! ’ the acceptable limerick goes : ‘ there was an @entity61 who supposed , that the street door was partially closed ; but some very large rats , ate his coats and his hats , while that futile old gentleman dozed			1
’ @entity6 approved of this poem , and wrote : ' this is the first one i have ever seen that did n't use the same word ! ' crossed out : @entity6 amended the final line of ' there was an old person of @entity188 '			2

@entity6 's copy of @entity12 's @entity191 is expected to fetch £ 1,500 at auction
@entity194 wrote on the book 's pages , changing the words of more than 100 limericks
the book was found in a job lot bought by a collector from @entity97 , @entity98
