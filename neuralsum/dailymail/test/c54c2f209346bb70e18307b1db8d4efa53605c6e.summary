almost three years after nearly leaving @entity1 @entity0 has committed his long - term future to the club convinced he can win silverware at @entity5			1
late in the summer of 2012 , just a couple of months into the reign of @entity8 , he was lined up as makeweight in a failed bid to sign @entity12 's @entity11 only for the midfielder to reject the move			2
his determination to prove himself , and justify the £ 16million price tag which came with him from @entity17 the previous summer , has been rewarded not only with a new five - year £ 100,000 - a - week contract but with the prospect of him taking over the captain 's armband from @entity24 when he leaves for the @entity25 at the end of the season			1
@entity0 is ' over the moon ' after signing a new long - term contract with @entity1 the club 's vice-captain puts pen to paper on a deal which will keep him at @entity1 until 2020 @entity0 has enjoyed a strong campaign and could be handed the armband when @entity24 leaves but it is the unfulfilled potential which persuaded the 24 - year - old @entity39 international to commit what should be the best years of his career to the club			1
' a few years ago i had an opportunity to leave but i always knew how big this club is and i wanted to stay here for as long as possible - and nothing has changed since then , ' he told liverpoolfc.com			1
' i feel as though i have got a good connection with the club now and there was no doubt where my future was going to be and it was just a matter of time for my agent and the club to sort it out			2
' i have been through difficult times but i would never change that because i know there will be more difficult times ahead and i 'll have to use that and i 'll be able to handle it a lot better			2
' hopefully we 've got many years ahead of winning trophies			2
' i 'm the same as every other player , i want to be playing at the highest level - in the @entity67 , winning trophies and being very successful			1
' i had good conversations with the manager about the future of the football club and it was very bright , i was very pleased with what i was hearing			0

i 've got a good feeling that we can do that			0

' we are obviously delighted			0
it is great news for the club and @entity103 that he will be spending best part of his career and development here at @entity1 and he is a big part of the plan going forward , ' said the @entity110 boss			0

' the likes of @entity103 and @entity92 are very important players and the club , behind the scenes , is working very hard to ensure we sign these type of players			1
