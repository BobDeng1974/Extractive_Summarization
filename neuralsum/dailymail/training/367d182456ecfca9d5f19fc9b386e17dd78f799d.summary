by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor national security adviser @entity2 defended the @entity6 @entity5 's @entity4 prisoner exchange on sunday morning , telling @entity7 and @entity9 audiences that releasing five high - level terror targets to the nation of @entity12 in exchange for sgt. @entity14 wo n't put @entity1 national security at risk			1
' we felt that as the war is winding down , it was our sacred obligation , given the opportunity to get him back , that we do so , ' @entity17 told @entity7 's @entity23 on the ' @entity25 ' program			1
' we did so in a way that resulted in the @entity4 prisoners being monitored and kept in a secure way in @entity12			2
' and addressing the thorny question of whether negotiating with terrorists might lead to more kidnappers ' demands for more detainee releases from @entity34 , @entity17 insisted that the military detention center is still slated for closure			1
' the terrorists are intent on doing what they want to do , ' she said , ' but @entity23 , we have a commitment to close @entity34			2
the president 's been very clear about that			0
' ' the existence of @entity34 is itself a detriment to our national security , which is why the president has prioritized closing it , and why we intend to get that done			1
the five @entity63 are among the most senior members of the @entity4 being held at the controversial camp , and include one who had direct ties to @entity68 @entity6 was n't required to notify @entity69 before letting five @entity4 fighters out of @entity34 , @entity17 said , because sgt. @entity14 's reportedly deteriorating health gave the president an emergency exception to a law he signed a year ago -- but @entity6 has written in the past that the notification requirement itself was unconstitutional @entity17 also said president @entity6 had spoken personally with @entity12 @entity79 on tuesday ' when this looked like it was a real possibility			1
' the amir , she said , promised @entity6 ' directly and personally ' that there would be restrictions on the five released @entity4 fighters – ' that these prisoners will be carefully watched , that their ability to move will be constrained			1
' ' we believe that this is in the national security interest of the @entity1 , ' she said			1
the only condition of their release that has been made public is a promise that they will not be permitted to leave @entity12 for one year			0
' are they free to be in the country , free to communicate with whoever they want ? ' @entity23 asked , ' or are they in detention in @entity12 ? ' @entity17 pledged that ' there are restrictions on their movement and behavior			1
i 'm not at liberty to get into detail about the precise nature of those restrictions			0
' ' but suffice it to say that we are satisfied , ' she added , ' that that substantially mitigates the risk to the @entity1 and to our national security and we feel confident that the assurances given to us will be upheld			1
' @entity17 's choice of words – ' substantially mitigates ' – will be a crucial element in the @entity6 administration 's defense of its decision			1
on @entity9 's ' @entity128 ' program , host @entity126 cited a federal law that ' requires assurances that they 're not going to be able to return to the battlefield ' and harm @entity1 interests			1
@entity17 leapt in to correct him			0
' the law says that we need to have sufficient confidence that the risk can be substantially mitigated , ' she protested			0
' and we do have ... that confidence based on a detailed understanding with the government of @entity12 based on president @entity6 's personal communication with the emir of @entity12 on tuesday			1
' @entity17 also dismissed public concerns about the nature of @entity14 's 2009 disappearance from his @entity148 unit			1
president @entity6 joined @entity149 and @entity150 , the parents of @entity148 sgt. @entity14 , in the @entity153 of the @entity5 on saturday to announce that their son had been released to @entity155 after five years in captivity @entity17 dismissed concerns about how @entity14 came to be captured five years ago , saying that ' the point is that he is back ' sgt. @entity14 's capture was first announced to the world in a july 2009 video in which one of his captors displayed his dog tags ' there are a lot of questions about how he originally was captured and whether or not he had deserted , had left his post , ' said @entity126			1
' is that going to be investigated ? and if it 's found that he did indeed leave his post , will he be disciplined – or has he already paid the price ? ' @entity17 downplayed concerns about any part @entity14 may have played in his own capture			2
' certainly anybody who has been held in those conditions , in captivity , for five years has paid an extraordinary price			0
but that is really not the point , ' she replied			0
' the point is that he is back			0
' some @entity186 in @entity69 are complaining that @entity6 broke a federal law that he himself signed in 2013 , by failing to notify lawmakers before transferring anyone out of the island detention center			2
the law also requires defense secretary @entity193 to explain why prisoners are being released , and to assure @entity69 that the freed terror suspects wo n't be able to reengage in any activities that might harm the @entity1 or its global interests			2
the @entity198 reported saturday night that @entity6 added a ' signing statement ' when he inked the bill into law , ' contending that the notification requirement was an unconstitutional infringement on his powers as commander - in - chief and that he therefore could override it			0
' @entity6 's national security adviser said @entity12 's emir had given the @entity5 ' sufficient assurances ' that the released detainees wo n't be able to harm the @entity1 or its interests @entity14 's release was celebrated in his hometown of @entity213 , @entity214 , but unconfirmed reports have circulated since saturday describing a different @entity148 sergeant -- one who deserted his post and went off in search of @entity4 fighters to join , not to fight while campaigning for president in 2008 , @entity6 habitually excoriated president @entity221 for issuing signing statements , calling them an unconstitutional " end - run ' around @entity69			1
“ @entity69 ’ job is to pass legislation , ' then - senator @entity6 explained during a may 19 , 2008 campaign stop in @entity228 , @entity229			0
' the president can veto it or he can sign it			0
but what @entity221 has been trying to do as part of his effort to accumulate more power in the presidency			0
' ' he ’s been saying , " well , i can basically change what @entity69 passed by attaching a letter saying i do n’t agree with this part or i do n’t agree with that part , [ and ] i ’m going to choose to interpret it this way or that way			0
" that 's not part of his power , but this is part of the whole theory of @entity221 that he can make laws as he goes along			0
' @entity2 has been an infrequent guest on sunday morning political talk shows since september 2012 when she told five separate audiences on a single sunday that a terror attack on @entity1 diplomatic facilities in @entity256 , @entity253 was the result of an anti-muslim @entity259 video			2
that explanation was later debunked , and evidence shows that the @entity6 administration knew almost immediately that an @entity265 - linked terror group called @entity266 had launched a premeditated attack			2
four @entity1 , including the @entity1 ambassador to @entity253 , died in the military - style assault			0
but @entity6 was weeks away from re-election , and insisting that his foreign policy had taken @entity265 off the battlefield .			0

@entity6 's national security adviser told @entity7 that the president pulled the *trigger* on a hostage exchange after @entity12 's emir promised that the five @entity4 the @entity1 released would not be able to reenter the terror battlefield
she also *rearticulated* @entity6 's pledge to close the @entity34 detention center , saying its existence *attracts* kidnappers who want a *bargaining* chip to free their *comrades*
@entity17 refused to discuss the circumstances of sgt. @entity14 's capture , and did n't address reports that he was @entity293 and looking to join the @entity4
she was careful to use talking - point language on @entity9 , saying that @entity6 was only required to determine that @entity12 's promises about the @entity4 fighters ' restrictions ' substantially mitigates ' the risk to the @entity1
