it appears like any other racing car - taking the perfect lines , making spilt second decisions and navigating a track at 150mph			1
however , @entity6 's new @entity5 has one big difference - it does n't have a driver			2
the @entity10 car giant let the car show off its at skills at top speed for the first time			2
the car has no driver - and is driven entirely by software			0
for orientation on the track , the car uses specially corrected gps signals			1
this gps data is transmitted to the vehicle via @entity32 according to the automotive standard and redundantly via high - frequency radio			0
in parallel to this , 3d cameras in the car film the track , and a computer program compares the cameras ' image information against a data set stored on board			1
this is what makes it possible for the technology pioneer to orient itself on the track within centimeters - and decide on the perfect race line			0
the @entity16 piloted driving concept completed a lap on the @entity20 track in @entity21 – at racing speed , without a driver			1
@entity6 scored yet another major success in the development of piloted driving : before the season finale of the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) , the latest technology pioneer was running up to its physical limit , with no driver			1
it took the @entity16 piloted driving concept just slightly over two minutes to complete a lap on the @entity20 track in @entity21 – piloted with high precision and accuracy to within centimeters			1
' the top performance by the @entity6 rs 7 today substantiates the skills of our development team with regard to piloted driving at @entity6 , ' said prof. dr. @entity71 , @entity72 at @entity6 ' the derivations from series production , particularly in terms of precision and performance , are of great value for our further development steps			1

piloted driving is one of the most important development fields at @entity6 : the first successful developments were achieved ten years ago			2
the test results continually flow into series development			0
the latest test runs at the physical limit are providing the @entity6 engineers with insights for the development of automatic avoidance functions in critical driving situations , for @entity115 assistance systems from @entity6 are already making driving more relaxed and better controlled			2
these systems ' highest level of development can be experienced in the updated @entity119 * and @entity121 * model series			0
the offerings include @entity6 side assist , @entity6 active lane assist , and adaptive cruise control with @entity127 function including @entity6 pre sense front			0
experts from @entity130 , the @entity131 ( @entity132 ) and @entity133 ( both in @entity134 ) are supporting @entity6 as partners in the further development of piloted systems .			1
