reflecting on his life after a near - fatal stroke , he believes he may have taken ‘ a wrong fork in the path ’ and wishes he had trained as an artist instead of going into journalism			1
the 54 - year - old father - of - three – who admitted being a workaholic before his illness in january – has recently returned to presenting the @entity1 show on a sunday morning			1
he has made a number of changes to his life following his stroke and revealed he now draws regularly in the week and the time spent doing this was the equivalent of praying to him			1
speaking about his love of drawing at the @entity26 , he said : ‘ i might have been a happier man if i had gone to art school , ' describing the decision as ‘ a wrong fork in the path i think probably ’			2
mr @entity1 said as a young man he was given the opportunity of studying art in @entity34 , but chose to read @entity35 at @entity36 instead			1
he draws for a couple of hours three or four times a week , he said , which helped him take time out from his busy life to find ‘ space ’			1
‘ when i draw i ’m doing something similar to when people pray , ’ he said			2
‘ we need time to get away			2
’ he described art as ‘ a primal need ’			0
‘ it is not a modern affectation , ’ he added			0
but he is unimpressed by modern art , saying the art world ‘ has gone mad ’			0
‘ an absolutely absurd , and i think obscene , amount of money is being spent on these artists , ’ he said			0
mr @entity1 did not elaborate on which artists he was talking about , but said he thought his friend @entity55 was ‘ about the only one ’ who could draw			1
mr @entity1 , seen here ( left ) interviewing @entity58 , recently returned to the @entity1 show after his stroke in january he said the only good thing about modern art being about ‘ 3d ’ and ‘ installations ’ was that ‘ the rest of us can reclaim drawing and reclaim painting without having to be part of the art world ’			1
mr @entity1 walked on stage at the festival with some difficulty but without the aid of a stick			2
he wore trainers with his blue suit to make it easier for him			0
asked about his recovery from his stroke , mr @entity1 said he was making progress thanks to physiotherapy - but only because he could afford to pay for private sessions			1
‘ i ’m very , very lucky because i have got the money to pay for physio and help , and you do need a lot , ’ he said			0
‘ a lot of people do not ( have the money )			0
’ he explained he had met dozens of people who have had strokes since his hospitalisation and that many had not been given the physiotherapy they needed to be able to lead normal lives again			0
mr @entity1 interviewed home secretary @entity98 on sunday as he returned to @entity1 show ‘ we are brilliant in this country at saving people ’s lives - we then chuck them out , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s crazy economically because if you gave them the physio early on they could get back to work quickly and pay taxes			0
’ he called for a national scheme to help people who did not have the means to pay for physiotherapy to get the help they need			0
last year , mr @entity1 ’s marriage to @entity118 journalist @entity117 came under pressure when he was pictured putting his hand down a female colleague ’s trousers during an intimate late - night clinch			2
however he has now pledged to be a beta male and a better family man .			0

@entity1 reveals he turned down chance to train as an artist
he draws for a couple of hours three or four times a week to find ' space '
