by @entity0 opponent : mp @entity2 fears that loving parents could be dragged to court on the say - so of estranged partners , nosy neighbours and disaffected children a law to protect children from emotional abuse risks becoming a ‘ charter for whining kids ’ , a @entity7 mp warned last night			1
government sources yesterday confirmed that a so - called @entity14 introducing jail terms for parents who starve their children of love and affection will be included in the @entity20 in june			1
ministers said the move would ensure ‘ emotional cruelty ’ is treated with the same seriousness as physical abuse and children ’s charities hailed it as a ‘ monumental step forward ’ for child protection			1
but critics said the law would be difficult to enforce – and warned that loving parents could be dragged to court on the say - so of estranged partners , nosy neighbours and disaffected children			1
the new offence would include doing anything that deliberately harms a child ’s ‘ physical intellectual , emotional , social or behavioural development ’			1
parents found guilty could face up to ten years in prison , the maximum term in child neglect cases			1
@entity7 mp @entity2 said : ‘ no - one is going to condone the extreme levels of abuse that some children suffer			2
but there is a real danger that this becomes a charter for every kid whining and complaining about a bit of tough love from their parents			2
‘ i am sure it ’s well - meaning , but we have seen in the past how easily these things get completely out of control with the result that perfectly decent parents , who love their kids and are trying to do their best , get dragged through the courts			2
’ he added : ‘ being a parent is a tough job and most people do their best – i do n’t want to see them caught up by this			0
if the government is going to go down this route then they are going to have to find pretty robust measures to protect ordinary , decent parents or they are going to create a monster			2
’ @entity76 , of the @entity77 , urged ministers to focus on helping parents rather than finding more ways to criminalise them			2
‘ this so - called @entity14 is yet another example of the state stepping in to criminalise parents where in fact education would be a far more powerful tool for combating harmful behaviour , ’ he said			0
‘ simply introducing swathes of new and hard - to - police legislation does not guarantee the right results			0
there should be a focus on helping parents who are having serious problems , not a rush to criminalise them			0
’ changes to child neglect legislation would make ' emotional cruelty ' a crime for the first time under what is being dubbed a ' @entity14 '			1
file picture deputy prime minister @entity105 yesterday welcomed the proposals , saying current laws did not reflect the terrible impact on children of emotional abuse			1
but he acknowledged the need for ministers to strike the right balance to prevent intrusion into normal family life			0
mr @entity105 said : ‘ you ca n’t micro-manage what goes on in the living room , in the family home , in the kitchen , in law			0
‘ but what you can do is make sure that where the state has to step in to stop maltreatment of children … that they reflect emotional and mental abuse just as much as more visible physical abuse			1
’ deputy prime minister @entity105 yesterday welcomed the proposals , saying current laws did not reflect the terrible impact on children of emotional abuse neglect is the most common reason for a child protection referral in the @entity136 and emotional abuse is more common in these cases than physical abuse , according to the @entity140			1
former @entity7 children ’s minister @entity141 backed the change in law and insisted it would not affect normal parenting			0
he said : ‘ what we ’re not talking about is somebody who shouts at their kid in the aisles at @entity152 because they go off on one			0
‘ this has got to be sustained and deliberate emotional abuse and i think we need to be able to give the powers to social workers and others that we entrust with the protection of children in this country , so that when they see something they clearly think is systemic neglect of that child , ongoing neglect , they can intervene			1
’ a previous bid to change the law was blocked by ministers in february last year , with justice minister @entity169 arguing that it was not needed and that it was not clear ‘ how a new offence would work in practice ’			0
but following a concerted campaign by children ’s charities mr @entity169 launched a consultation on the issue in the autumn			0
sir @entity179 , chief executive of the charity @entity180 , said : ‘ this is a monumental step forward for thousands of children who we know suffer from emotional abuse and countless others whose desperate situations have yet to come to light			2
‘ i ’ve met children who have been scapegoated in their families , constantly humiliated and made to feel unloved			0
the impact is devastating and can lead to life - long mental health problems and , in some cases , suicide			0
