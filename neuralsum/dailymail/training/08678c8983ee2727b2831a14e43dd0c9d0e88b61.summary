by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor without immigration @entity5 women will have to have ' a lot of children very quickly ' to keep the economy and the @entity10 afloat , a @entity3 rising star has claimed			1
@entity11 , 37 , said @entity12 was ' deeply unpatriotic ' because his policies on @entity14 and immigration were ' basically talking about managing the decline of @entity5 '			1
the unmarried @entity3 mp said without immigration women already in the @entity5 will have to breed for @entity5 to support the growing number of pensioners			1
@entity3 rising star @entity11 said @entity5 women would have to have ' a lot of children very quickly ' if the country slashed immigration			1
she said there were not enough youngsters to support the rapidly ageing population miss @entity11 said society was ' rife with sexism ' and so was politics			1
she said the ' commons and politics is no different ' to everywhere else			2
the @entity3 mp said : ‘ @entity34 , like society , is full of all sorts of unconscious barriers to equality			2
' you know , if i hear another person saying that “ leadership takes balls ”			1
' this is not being disrespectful to mr @entity44 , but surely we should say leadership is about guts			1
it ’s not gender - specific			1
’ miss @entity11 , who does not have children , said without a baby boom ' our ability to sustain our economy ' will collapse - leaving the @entity10 in crisis			2
the @entity3 mp 's controversial remarks are likely to spark controversy and come just days after the former @entity57 chancellor @entity56 dismissed the claim that immigration was needed to cope with an ageing society			0
in a letter to the @entity63 newspaper he cited a @entity65 report that found ‘ no evidence			0
that immigration generates significant economic benefit ’ and rubbished the claim that migrants were a ‘ bulwark against an ageing population ’			2
he said this would lead to a need for ‘ ever escalating levels of immigration ’ as the migrants themselves became old and needed more youngsters in the country to look after them as well			2
but miss @entity11 said @entity77 were a party of hand wringers who complain ' is n't it awful ' while running @entity5 down			1
she said : ' i think @entity12 is actually , frankly , deeply unpatriotic because he ’s basically talking about managing the decline of @entity5			1
' he does n’t seem to think that we can compete with @entity85 inventors or that we can compete with the @entity87 capital			0
he seems to have written us off			0
’ miss @entity89 , appearing on ' @entity88 ' in august last year , was the victim of vile online abuse over support for a woman to be featured on a bank note			2
she also led a successful campaign to force the government to clamp down on pay day lenders changing sky - high interest rates miss @entity89 , pictured here in @entity101 in @entity102 , is the @entity3 member of parliament for @entity104 in east @entity105			0
she has been tipped as a future @entity3 leader she adds : ‘ talk to @entity12 not just about the immigrants who come here and create jobs but the immigrants who come here and create skills and create opportunities for people and create new ideas for people			1
miss @entity11 said @entity12 was ' deeply unpatriotic ' because his policies would result in the ' decline ' of @entity5 ‘ there are now more people over the age of 65 than under the age of 16 in @entity5			1
‘ so unless women like me have a lot of children very quickly our ability to sustain our economy , to sustain our public services [ will come under threat ]			0
' it ’s not just that these guys want to charge you to use the @entity10 , it ’s that their policies will actually mean the @entity10 will not exist by [ @entity5 ] not being able to have an economy than can support it			1
’ miss @entity11 said unlike @entity77 she was ' incredibly optimistic about the future ’			0
but she warned that the amount of debt families were taking on could cause the economy to crash			0
she said : ‘ we have this big bubble of personal debt coming up and … it will drag us all down			0
‘ we have to stop being @entity5 and coy about talking about debt because that ’s where these companies do well , [ it ] is people feeling ashamed			1
' it ca n’t be a silent source of shame any more , it ’s got to be something we talk about and which we manage together as a community			0
’ miss @entity89 also hit out at left wingers in her party who are angry at plans to make cuts to reduce the deficit			2
she said : ‘ if we get our economy wrong , it ’s the poorest who miss out and they pay the most comparatively in taxes			0
' she added : ‘ everyone ’s very negative about this idea that we ’re going to face difficult financial challenges			0
' she sees instead the chance to ‘ reshape services to get better outcomes for people			0
actually it will be cheaper			0
