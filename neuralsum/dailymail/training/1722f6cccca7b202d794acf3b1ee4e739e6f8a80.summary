' you do n't say : @entity1 has promised not to make any further claims that its @entity14 ( pictured ) or its @entity13 anti-aging serums ' target ' or ' affect ' genes , unless they are backed up by hard science @entity1 , the world 's largest cosmetics company , previously claimed that its @entity13 products , which sell for up to $ 132 a container , are ' clinically proven to boost genes ' and simulate the production of ' youth proteins , ' resulting in ' visibly younger skin ' in just a week			1
on the product 's website , amid mentions of ' cutting - edge science ' and claims that the serum ' recaptures the key signs of youth , ' its ' proof ' section is merely a handful of consumer testimonials , including , from an ' @entity47 ' user : ' this is the most amazing product , i will never go without it again			0
' as for @entity1 's @entity14 serum , which is priced much cheaper at $ 25 a container , ' ten years of gene research ' has led the company to claim : ' we now have the knowledge to help you begin cracking the code to younger acting skin			2
