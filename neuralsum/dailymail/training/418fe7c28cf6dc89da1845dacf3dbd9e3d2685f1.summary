@entity1 manager @entity0 believes @entity2 should not face disciplinary action after appearing to catch @entity5 defender @entity4 in the face with a stray elbow on monday night			1
@entity2 caught can in the side of the head during the first half of @entity1 's 4 - 1 @entity12 defeat at @entity5 and , although the incident went unpunished at the time , the @entity1 midfielder could face retrospective action from the @entity16 if referee @entity17 highlights it in his match report			1
@entity0 said after the game he had yet to view the incident properly , but he defended his player on tuesday morning after seeing footage of it on the team bus on the way home from @entity5			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity28 was caught on camera flinging an elbow towards @entity4 during the first half at @entity32 @entity2 catches the @entity5 midfielder in the face during another performance that prompted criticism the 22 - year - old watches as his headers finds the back of the net at @entity32 ' there was a motion towards the player , but it 's not clear , ' @entity0 said at his press conference ahead of the @entity46 ' trip to @entity47 on @entity48			1
' i spoke to @entity2 on the way home and he said his intention was not to catch the player at all			1
' he said the player was tugging on him and he was just trying to push him away from him to move it			2
' i do n't think it was an intentional elbow at all and the referee was perfectly placed			2
' no - one had a better view of the incident than him			1
he felt it did n't warrant any more action and the game went on			0
' there were no complaints from any of the players afterwards , so you have to trust the referee made the right decision - and we thought that he did			2
' @entity2 ( left ) had another evening to forget as @entity1 lost 4 - 1 to @entity5 the former @entity70 star leaves the pitch after scoring an own goal and courting controversy with an elbow @entity2 is likely to come under scrutiny after being seen joking with @entity76 during the match @entity5 's @entity79 forward @entity78 faces a similar anxious wait to see if he could also be punished after tangling with @entity1 's @entity82 central defender @entity81 during the closing stages of the match			1
the 20 - year - old slapped @entity81 in the face , but @entity70 boss @entity86 said after the game that the referee dealt with both situations sensibly and did not expect either @entity78 or @entity2 to face @entity16 action			1
@entity91 agreed with @entity86 ' assessment of both incidents and said @entity78 did not deserve a red card for raising his arm to @entity81			0
' it 's the same situation , ' @entity0 said			2
' yes , there is a motion towards @entity81 's face , but for me the referee and the linesman were the best placed people to see			0
' the referee looked straight at it and decided it did n't warrant any action			0
' does it warrant a sending off ? not for me , but again you have to trust that the referee 's in the right place and doing the right thing			0
' @entity5 's @entity78 ( right ) swung an arm towards the face of @entity81 ( left ) on monday the incident came during the closing stages of @entity5 's 4 - 1 @entity12 win against @entity1 @entity1 's heaviest defeat of 2014 saw @entity5 leapfrog them into eighth place in the midst of what has been a heavy festive programme for @entity91 's men , who have already had trips to @entity126 and @entity32 and must now visit @entity127 and then saturday 's third - round @entity129 opponents @entity128 in the space of 48 hours			1
' in terms of preparation , it 's difficult , ' @entity0 said			2
' it 's nice to have a week 's build - up to get more details into the players , but i 've played in these periods and i love the quick turnover of games			0
' i think players do enjoy it and they 're used to it in this country			0
' but physically it is difficult to churn out top - level performances in such a short space of time			0
' there 's a higher risk of injuries at this level , with the intensity and the physicality of games , but that 's the challenge for all of us			0
' we 've got to deal with it , and the medical staff have put programmes in place for the players for their recovery			0
