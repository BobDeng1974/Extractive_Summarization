a forthcoming @entity2 - organised conference on communications poses a grave threat to the freedom of the internet , @entity0 has warned			1
the @entity8 search giant said the december gathering of the @entity2 's @entity10 comes amid ' a growing backlash on internet freedom '			1
the @entity13 on @entity14 in @entity15 will update global telecom rules for the first time since 1988 , and some countries see this as an opportunity to set up new rules for the @entity12			1
behind closed doors : @entity0 has warned that the planned meeting of the @entity2 's @entity10 comes amid ' a growing backlash on internet freedom ' there are fears proposals made by @entity28 , @entity29 and other nations could threaten the open model of internet governance by giving the @entity2 a greater role			1
oversight of the net 's domain name system and technical specifications is currently undertaken by @entity39 - based bodies , but some countries want an international organisation to take responsibility			1
@entity0 's statement said ' the @entity10 is the wrong place to make decisions about the future of the @entity12 ' because ' only governments have a voice at the @entity10 , ' including some ' that do not support a free and open @entity12			2
' ' the @entity10 is also secretive , ' @entity0 said			2
' the treaty conference and proposals are confidential			0
' @entity0 said some proposed treaty changes ' permit governments to censor legitimate speech — or even allow them to cut off internet access '			1
others , the company warned , ' would require services like @entity59 , @entity60 , and @entity61 to pay new tolls in order to reach people across borders			0
' this could limit access to information - particularly in emerging markets			0
' champion of free speech ? @entity0 's position chimes with that of the @entity39 , which wants the institutions that govern the internet to remain in @entity39 @entity0 's comments backed the @entity39 position , which is that the non-government ' multi-stakeholder ' system of the internet should remain in place			1
' governments alone should not determine the future of the @entity12 , ' the @entity0 blog said			2
' the billions of people around the globe that use the @entity12 , and the experts that build and maintain it , should be included			0
' @entity0 last week admitted that it had received - and complied with - a record number of requests from governments to reveal information about its users this year			2
the latest edition of the search giant 's @entity96 shows governments around the world made nearly 21,000 requests to access its data in the first six months of 2012			0
the @entity39 government made the most demands , asking for users ' details 7,969 times between january and june this year			0
the @entity106 came sixth - behind @entity107 and @entity108 - with 1,425 requests			0
' this is the sixth time we ’ve released this data , and one trend has become clear : government surveillance is on the rise , ' @entity114 , a senior policy analyst for @entity0 , said in a blog post			0
' in the first half of 2012 , there were 20,938 inquiries from government entities around the world			0
those requests were for information about 34,614 accounts			0
' the @entity10 has however said that countries attending the meeting could invite whoever they wise to be part of their delegations at the meeting , the @entity126 reported			0
the @entity0 response comes a week after @entity29 submitted its proposal to the @entity10 suggesting the @entity39 should have less control over the net , provoking strong reactions from some online activists			1
the @entity29 proposal said : ' member states shall have equal rights to manage the internet , including in regard to the allotment , assignment and reclamation of internet numbering , naming , addressing and identification resources and to support for the operation and development of basic internet infrastructure			1
' currently , these internet infrastructure matters are dealt with by non-profit bodies ultimately answerable to the @entity39 @entity154 , but which in effect are suppoed to operate at arm 's length from the @entity39 government			1
@entity159 , an analyst with the @entity161 consultancy who follows technology issues , said the @entity29 proposal ' makes explicit ' @entity165 's desire to bring the internet under greater control of the @entity2 agency and diminish the role of the @entity170 , which manages the internet address system			1
' the @entity29 federation 's proposal ... would in specific substantially if not completely change the role of @entity170 in overseeing domain names and ip addresses , ' @entity159 said in a blog post			2
' of course the @entity29 , along with other repressive governments , uses every opportunity to gain control over the free flow of information , and sees the internet as its most formidable enemy			2
' @entity39 ambassador to the @entity10 @entity187 has already signalled he would not support the proposals from @entity29			1
he has said the existing institutions have ' functioned effectively and will continue to ensure the health and growth of the internet ' .			0
