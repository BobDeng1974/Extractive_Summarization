by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 for @entity1 tennis star : @entity4 today revealed he would play for @entity5 if it became independent with only 20 days left until polls open , the campaign for @entity5 independence has sparked huge political debate across @entity11			1
and now , tennis star @entity4 has revealed that he would play for @entity5 if it became independent			1
the 27 - year - old , who was born in @entity14 and grew up in @entity15 , said he would represent his country even if it opts to leave the @entity17 in the 2014 referendum			1
but he added that he does not believe independence is likely to happen			2
speaking of the @entity20 , @entity4 told @entity1 : ' if it happened where , if @entity5 became independent , then i imagine i would be playing for @entity5			1
' but he added : ' i have n't thought much about that yet because i do n't think it 's looking too likely that it 's going to happen			2
' ever since i started travelling to tournaments aged 11 , i played under @entity11			0
when i travelled to team events or overseas , we were always @entity11			0
that 's normal to me			0
' but if it did happen [ if @entity5 became independent ] , then it would be pretty much the first time in my life that i have represented @entity5			1
' @entity4 , who has famously refused to endorse either side of the argument in the referendum , said he has followed the debate ' very closely '			2
he said : ' i watched 45 minutes of the second [ television ] debate			0
but i did n't see the first one			0
i 'm not going into that			0
i do n't want to talk about politics here			0
i 'll worry about my tennis			0
' since his rise to fame , @entity4 's national identity has been widely commented on by the @entity17 media			1
in 2006 , the sportsman provoked a backlash when he joked that he would support ' anyone but @entity50 ' in the football @entity51 , a remark he said he later regretted			1
above , @entity60 's ( left ) poor act in the second tv debate gave a huge boost to @entity64 's ( right ) campaign narrower lead : following the tv debate , a poll by the @entity5 @entity67 revealed the no campaign still has a six - point lead over the @entity71 campaign , but that is down from a 14 - point lead enjoyed just three weeks ago and during a cameo appearance on comedy show outnumbered , he was asked whether he considers himself to be @entity17 or @entity5			1
@entity4 responded : ' it depends if i 'm winning			0
' yesterday , the tennis player eased his way into the third round of the @entity82 by defeating @entity84 's @entity83 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 4			0
it comes as @entity60 ’s poor performance in the second television debate on @entity5 independence has given a huge boost to @entity64 ’s campaign			1
the debate on monday , which was watched by more than two million people , was a disaster for the no campaign , which saw its lead narrow sharply			1
success : today , @entity4 eased his way into the third round of the @entity82 by defeating @entity84 's @entity83 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 4			2
above , the tennis star is pictured returning a shot to @entity83 during the match a poll by the @entity5 @entity67 revealed the @entity101 campaign led by mr @entity60 still enjoys a six percentage point lead over the independence supporters among decided voters			1
but this is down from the 14 - point lead it had after the first debate three weeks ago			2
if the shift in support towards the @entity113 continues at the same rate until polling day on september 18 , it would see @entity5 vote to leave the @entity17 , ending the 300 - year - old union			1
the poll results came as @entity118 warned that one million jobs rely on the @entity120 and urged , ‘ @entity121			2
’ prime minister : @entity118 has warned that one million jobs rely on the @entity120 , urging ' @entity121 ' the prime minister said : ‘ i want to talk about the business case for @entity5 in the @entity17 , something which matters to every man , woman and child in our country			2
‘ our economy ’s first great advantage is opportunity – the opportunity that comes from a domestic market of 60million people and nearly five million businesses			0
‘ this is one of the oldest and most successful single markets in the world			0
but if we pull that apart , if we make foreigners of our neighbours , business becomes tougher , trade becomes more costly and complex , and jobs become harder to find			0
