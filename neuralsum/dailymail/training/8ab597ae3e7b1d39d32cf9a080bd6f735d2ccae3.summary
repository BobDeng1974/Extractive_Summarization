a teenager who was robbed of her dreams by a motorist who skipped a red light is campaigning for a new law to clamp down on careless drivers			1
@entity6 , 18 , had been attempting to cross a road in @entity8 , @entity9 , on @entity10 this year when she was struck by the impatient motorist and left fighting for her life			1
@entity6 , who was hoping to attend university in september to study nursing , suffered a serious brain injury and spent four weeks in intensive care and months in a rehabilitation centre			1
@entity6 , pictured left before her accident and right today , was knocked down by a driver who skipped a red light she has had to learn to walk , talk and eat and undergone five operations - while the man that was found guilty of causing her accident received a mere four year driving ban and a Â£ 1,400 fine			1
the family were told that the @entity30 did not think they could guarantee a conviction for dangerous driving - despite ignoring a red light			1
magistrates were unable to impose a custodial sentence on @entity36 and , along with a ban and a fine , he must pass an advanced driving test before he can regain his licence			1
her mother @entity41 , 50 , a church administrator , said the family were left ' disappointed ' by the sentence			0
she has described the moment she was rushed to @entity46 in @entity47 , where she convinced her daughter would be dead			0
her face was so black and purple and swollen i could hardly recognise her , ' she told the @entity53			0
' we were told it was touch and go , that @entity6 might not live			2
' we were given no promises , no one could predict if she would ever regain consciousness , or if she would be left in a vegetative state			0
' she slept in a chair in the hospital over the course of three weeks until @entity6 was finally moved from the intensive care unit at the end of january and moved to the head injuries ward			1
before the accident , @entity6 had plans to go to university and study nursing , but now she has had to go back to school it took @entity6 a while to figure out where she was and why and she admitted she could n't remember the accident at all , and thought it might have happened on the landing of her home , fighting with one of her sisters			1
through physiotherapy she gradually began to get better - learning to walk , talk and eat again and in april she was discharged to a rehabilitation centre run by @entity83 in @entity84			2
during her time in hospital doctors had had to cut her long hair off and it was at the @entity83 that she made contact with charity the @entity89 , who provided her with a real hair wig			0
she stayed there for 14 weeks before she was readmitted to @entity46 in august to have permanent metal plates put into her skull			0
in september she was discharged and went back to school but it was far from her dream of beginning a nursing course and lives at home with her mother in @entity101 , @entity102			0
@entity6 still has some paralysis in her left hand and her right arm is numb in parts - but is still determined to get the best possible grades in her studies			2
now , along with her two older sisters @entity110 , 21 , a law student at @entity112 , and @entity113 , 19 , who is studying health and social care @entity114 , @entity6 is pressing for a new law to be introduced			1
the girls launched an online petition aimed at the prime minister @entity120 to introduce a new offence , of causing serious injury by careless driving , to the law			1
they state : ' on the 1st january 2014 , our younger 17 - year - old sister , @entity6 , was hit by a car at a pedestrian crossing			1
' the driver had driven through a red light			1
@entity6 suffered a serious brain injury			1
she was not expected to survive			0
' however , thanks to quick medical intervention and extensive continuing rehabilitation , she survived , albeit left permanently impaired and brain damaged			2
' the effects of @entity6 's accident have been life changing for all her family and friends , and most of all @entity6			1
' she was due to go to university this year but it was put on hold			0
she struggles with every day things because of her disabilities			0
@entity6 's mother @entity41 , 50 , right , said the family were left ' disappointed ' by the sentence and they are now campaigning for a change in the law after the man that knocked her over received a ban and a fine ' the driver who hit her was only charged with ' driving without due care and attention ' ( careless driving )			1
' under @entity161 law , the typical punishment for this offence is 3 - 9 penalty points			0
a ban from driving is only discretionary			0
' currently the law for careless driving only has two outcomes - causing death and all other results			2
for dangerous driving there are clauses set out , including causing serious injury by dangerous driving , which carries a maximum five year prison sentence			2
the sister 's add : ' our family feel that this is a huge gap in the law that needs to be filled			0
' why should the fortunate fact that someone survives affect the chance of the driver being disqualified ? after the accident doctors had to cut off her hair and she was given a real hair wig by the @entity89 ' if she had died he would have received a one year mandatory disqualification and our family would not have had to worry about the prospect of him getting mere points for what happened			2
' ' we feel that it is time that driving offences were taken more seriously so that other families do not have to go through what we have been through			0
' there needs to be more clarity in the law as to what constitutes " careless " as opposed to " dangerous driving " , especially given the huge difference in punishment between these two offences , and a new offence of " causing serious injury by careless driving "			2
' our family has felt incredibly let down by the justice system and we can only hope that things can improve for future victims like @entity6			0
' @entity6 may not have got the justice she deserved but we want to make sure other families do and do not have to go through what our family went through			0
