it was well past 2am at @entity1 and , before jumping in his car to head back to @entity4 , @entity2 was animatedly demonstrating a forehand stroke to make his point			1
his coaching client @entity7 had just been pushed hard by @entity8 on a raucous night in @entity9 ’s but survived to make it into the semi-finals of the @entity12			1
@entity2 was speaking admiringly of how hard @entity8 had been hitting his forehand , but suggested it was that effort which lay behind his body stiffening up towards the end of the match			1
the remedy , he believes , is that this game style must be replicated every time the 27 - year - old @entity20 walks on court , whoever the opponent			0
aggression : @entity2 said that @entity8 should keep up his aggressive style of play ‘ the first two and a half sets @entity8 hit the ball as cleanly as i have seen him do it in a long time , he hit the forehand hard but maybe it took its toll , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ he is turning his body right round to hit the shot , and it ’s made harder by @entity7 putting so much spin on the ball			2
it will become easier for @entity8 if he plays like this day in , day out			2
’ what @entity2 saw in the course of a 7 - 6 , 6 - 7 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 4 defeat for @entity8 is that it will not be long before the @entity20 is back in the world ’s top five			1
‘ the serve , forehand and backhand package was @entity8 at his very best until midway through the third set			2
i would expect him to have a good finish to the season on that evidence			0
there ’s a good base for him to work from over the next six months			0
i think it is only a matter of time before he wins a tournament			0
’ sidelines : former @entity57 champion @entity2 is @entity7 's current coach what the @entity60 @entity59 champion had prophesied before the match — that @entity7 ’s easier progress through the earlier rounds would be a factor — had come to pass			1
‘ sooner or later you are going to play someone who is as good as you are , and you are going to need every bit of energy you have got to beat him , ’ said @entity2			1
afterwards @entity8 said he was a little disappointed about how his body reacted , given that he began training in @entity73 straight after @entity57			1
@entity7 observed that , in their matches , ‘ i feel like there is a point where i feel i have that edge , you know , maybe physically ’			2
sitting courtside it was indeed striking how , after long rallies of often brutal intensity , @entity8 ’s chest would be heaving while his opponent would usually look ready to go again			2
defeat : @entity7 beat @entity8 in four sets at the @entity12 in @entity1 the @entity86 got married shortly after his @entity57 win and his mediocre results in the events leading up to the @entity12 suggested that he had taken it easy for a considerable period			1
and yet , in the @entity93 itself his fitness looks to have been restored to a supreme level			0
@entity8 could hardly be more diligent about his physical conditioning , and will have to bring the same level of application to working on his second serve if he is to revisit the heights achieved when @entity100 was his coach			1
his second delivery can sit up invitingly for the best returners to feast upon			0
he was broken 20 times in five matches , and that is a major reason why there was less left in the tank when it came to the ultimate battle against @entity7 , who will now face no 10 seed @entity111 in the last four			2
the @entity113 came through his second five - set match in succession to beat @entity116 3 - 6 , 7 - 5 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 7 , 6 - 4 and reach his first @entity93 semi-final			0
form : @entity7 had been struggling for form before the @entity12 and had not seemed fully fit considering that @entity8 returned from back surgery in january , three @entity93 quarter - finals and a semi-final is respectable and would be considered a dream scenario for all but the very best players			1
this result leaves him at @entity125 in the world , but that is sure to improve from here as he has no ranking points to defend from the corresponding period 12 months ago , when he was having the operation			0
he will need to perform strongly in the next two months otherwise he will miss out on the points bonanza that is the @entity132 at the @entity133 in november			0
rankings : after a brilliant 2012 , @entity8 slipped down the rankings to no 8 in the world after a break at home he will play two @entity143 events in @entity144 , one of which will be in either @entity145 or @entity146 and the other the @entity147			1
then comes the @entity149 indoor event ahead of the season finale in @entity151			0
@entity8 said he will not add extra events just to try to make the field for the @entity154 : ‘ i do n’t want to overplay			2
i ’ll play the right schedule and just try to qualify			0
’ given that what he is really lacking are the opportunities to register wins over top players you would have expected him to speak with more urgency			0
but it was very late , and @entity7 had ensured he was very tired .			0

@entity8 lost in four sets to @entity7 at the @entity12
@entity2 said that @entity8 was playing well and should play same style
