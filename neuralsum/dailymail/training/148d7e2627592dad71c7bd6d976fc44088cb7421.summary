by @entity0 published : 07:57 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 14:53 est , 19 november 2013 a youth worker has set himself the challenge of meeting 730 of his @entity4 friends in one year , despite many of them living overseas			1
@entity7 , vowed to meet each of his virtual friends in august , and will have to encounter two per day if he wants to reach his goal			2
the 38 - year - old from @entity12 , @entity13 , was coaxed into accepting the challenge when his cousin bet him he had n't met all the people on his friends ' list in real life			1
his 28th encounter was with friend @entity24 ( right ) @entity25 ( left ) was among the 129 friends @entity27 has met so far , as was friend , @entity28 , his 44th meeting ( right ) so far mr @entity7 has travelled to @entity30 and @entity31 to meet friends like @entity33 ( left ) and @entity34 ( right ) starting with his wife , @entity21 , who volunteered to be the first name he could tick off the list , mr @entity7 has visited @entity30 and @entity31 and met up with 129 people			1
though he has tried to restrict the list to local friends , the youth worker will eventually be forced to venture further afield to complete the challenge , with friends living as far away as @entity43 and @entity44			0
mr @entity7 said : ' it 's been great going around and meeting up with old friends and proving him wrong			0
' ' i 've started with my local friends first , and i met one in @entity30 last week , but i 'll soon have to book some time off work to travel around and meet others			0
' there 's one or two people i know in @entity54 and i 've got a cousin in @entity56 , but hopefully they 'll be able to come here , otherwise it might start to get very expensive			0
relaxing with friend number four , @entity59 ( left ) and with @entity60 who dressed in costume for the occasion ( right ) mr @entity7 is hoping to raise money for the @entity64 in his challenge			1
friends @entity67 ( left ) and @entity68 ( right ) pose for pictures after meeting up according to his wife , mr @entity7 has always taken an interest in charity and tries to raise money whenever he can			2
he is pictured with @entity74 ( left ) and @entity75 ( right ) ' i 've also got some friends in @entity44 and @entity43 , who might be too difficult to meet for now , but that 's why i decided to set the number at 730 - two friends a day is still a very good rate			0
' the popular youth worker in fact has 1,103 friends on the social networking website but only has to meet 730 of them in order to win the bet			1
if he does n't manage to , he has vowed to grow a beard for @entity89 next year to raise awareness for testicular cancer			0
mr @entity7 is campaigning for people to sponsor his challenge in aid of the @entity64 , a condition suffered by his wife 's stepfather			1
mrs @entity98 said : ' i think it 's an absolutely crazy idea , and i have noticed that the petrol expenses have been going up in recent months since he started it , but it 's brilliant that @entity103 's doing such a lot of fundraising			0
if @entity7 does n't complete the challenge in one year , he will grow a beard for @entity89 next year in aide of testicular cancer			0
friends @entity110 ( left ) and @entity111 ( right ) were happy to support his efforts @entity113 was the most recent friend encounter , with 129 people now ticked off mr @entity7 's list of 730 while @entity27 has n't ruled out travelling overseas to complete the challenge , he has tried to whittle his list down to more local friends than those in @entity43 and @entity44 for example ' he 's done quite a lot things for charity over the years - one year he grew a full beard for @entity125 , and he looked awful - but this one tops the lot			1
' it 's also for a cause that 's very close to my heart - my step - dad suffered from motor neurone disease , so i know he 's raising money for @entity64 partly for me , which is a really lovely gesture			2
' dressed in a ' @entity4 friend ' t - shirt , mr @entity7 poses for a photograph with every friend he meets in person to post online			2
documenting his progress in a blog , the 38 - year - old shares meeting 50 friends at once while at a party and persuading passers - by to take his photograph .			1
