by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has revealed how the @entity4 players used footballs as missiles in an attempt to knock down the spy drone that flew over their training ground last week			1
the @entity4 team have become embroiled in a spying row after reporting that their training had been interrupted by a small , unmanned aircraft that was presumably armed with a camera			1
speaking after the @entity16 opened their @entity18 campaign with an impressive 3 - 0 win against an over-physical @entity20 , their captain spoke of an extraordinary incident that brought one of their training sessions to a halt			1
video : scroll down for @entity4 fans in @entity28 enjoy 3 - 0 @entity18 win over @entity20 @entity29 : @entity2 acknowledges the fans after @entity4 's 3 - 0 victory over @entity20 on sunday missiles : the drone flew over their training ground during a session last week over the top : a drone with a spy camera attached ( not one which flew above @entity4 's training ground ) ‘ it ’s a good invention , ’ said @entity2 with a smile			1
‘ it looked like a little helicopter and it flew well			0
we heard it first and then we saw it			0
we did n’t see anyone controlling			0
maybe they were behind the stand or the hotel			0
it was a big challenge to hit it			0
’ on saturday the @entity4 coach @entity54 said the matter — which he described as an invasion of their privacy — was now being investigated by @entity59			1
curiously , a @entity59 spokesperson has said they have not received an official complaint from the @entity16 federation			1
in the same @entity67 press conference a @entity65 journalist insisted his country was not responsible for the drone			0
‘ no ? ’ said @entity54 with more than a hint of suspicion			1
if @entity20 were responsible , it did not do them much good here in @entity73			1
brace yourself : @entity75 scored two as @entity4 beat @entity20 in their opening game on sunday harmonious : @entity54 has created a seemingly more harmonious @entity4 camp than before reading the signals @entity81 coach @entity80 was fined $ 500,000 for taping opposition coaches to decipher signals			1
@entity84 @entity86 youth coach @entity85 hid in a tree in camouflage gear to spy on @entity89			2
scaring the lions @entity91 allegedly recorded @entity93 rugby training but said the tourists were paranoid			0
a room with a view @entity97 said the @entity98 used top - floor motel rooms to spy on their plays			2
@entity101 @entity103 staff tried to blend in at a children ’s judo practice next to a @entity107 training session			0
was @entity2 concerned on privacy grounds ? ‘ players can do nothing about that , ’ he said with a shrug			2
‘ maybe the guy is from the hotel just behind the stand and you ca n’t see him			0
maybe with a good job of the security we can find him ! ’ if @entity75 was among those who launched a football at the drone , he proved more accurate against @entity20			1
this @entity18 has so far seen the big - name forwards make an early impact and @entity75 was no exception — the @entity127 striker scoring twice on his @entity18 debut			1
‘ he had a really good season with @entity127 , winning the @entity132 final , ’ said @entity2			0
‘ that has given him good confidence			0
he played well during the preparation games and he was in excellent condition to play			0
it was important for him to start well because he is a decisive player for @entity4			2
‘ maybe he is our key player and he showed it			0
this competition is the perfect platform to show who he is to everyone			0
’ @entity2 said the @entity4 players should be more than happy with their performance against physically aggressive opponents who were reduced to 10 men before half time with the dismissal of @entity151			1
fumble : @entity20 ' goalkeeper @entity152 spills the ball over the line to give @entity4 a 2 - 0 lead goal - line technology : the ball was ruled in after the decision was taken to video replay for the first time at a @entity18 ‘ it ’s a good start , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ we expected that kind of game and we had good control			2
it was a tough game physically because @entity20 play very hard , very strong			1
but we stayed very calm and played our own game			2
‘ we have to stay calm because it ’s just the first game			2
we have two more strong games against @entity169 and @entity170			0
i think the next game will be decisive for us			2
‘ i do n’t want to compare to four years ago but , for me and everyone , it was really important to start well this time and come into the competition with a good performance and a good result			0
’ seeing red : @entity151 was sent off just before half time after a second bookable offence for flooring @entity179 in the area lucky : but the @entity107 midfielder could perhaps consider himself fortunate for not being sent off himself for an incident with the same player earlier			1

@entity16 players used the balls as missiles to try to ground the *device*
coach @entity54 described the incident as an invasion of privacy
@entity4 beat @entity20 3 - 0 in their opening @entity18 game on sunday
@entity75 scored twice in a match that also saw @entity197 midfielder @entity151 sent off for the losing side
