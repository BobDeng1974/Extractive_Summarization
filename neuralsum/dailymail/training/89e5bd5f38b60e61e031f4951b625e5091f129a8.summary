by @entity0 published : 07:34 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 12:39 est , 18 november 2013 delay : paramedics were made to wait 26 minutes to treat stroke victim @entity2 , 89 , as managers would not let them enter his sheltered accommodation room paramedics were prevented from tending to a stroke victim after care home managers refused to let them enter his room because it breached company policy			1
@entity2 who was a mechanic in @entity10 collapsed while he was on the phone to insurers the @entity13 after he called them about repairs to his car			1
the aa operator quickly dialled 999 and paramedics rushed to the 89 - year - old 's room at the @entity20 sheltered housing complex in @entity22 , near @entity23			1
however , when the ambulance crew arrived , staff would not let them enter the room , and they were made to wait for 26 minutes until a warden arrived with a spare key			1
a telephone operator also refused to give paramedics the code for a wall - mounted safe which contained a master key because it was ' against company policy '			1
frightened mr @entity2 was screaming for help through the letter box , while paramedics were forced to wait on the other side of the door			1
when a warden finally arrived with a master key , paramedics entered the room and rushed mr @entity2 , who served as an @entity42 mechanic in @entity43 during @entity10 , to hospital where he died of a heart attack nine days later			1
his family have accused the managers of the sheltered housing complex , run by @entity49 , of endangering the lives of residents			2
his daughter @entity52 , 66 , is considering taking legal action against @entity54 , which runs the out - of - hours service for places for people			0
' my father was fit and healthy for his age but i strongly believe the stress of being left on the floor in his room while paramedics were outside caused his death , ' said mrs @entity52 , a retired community care worker			2
' he was on the phone to the @entity13 about his car when he suffered a stroke			0
' the operator called 999 and my father tried to get to the front door so he could open it for the paramedics			2
' he always locked himself in because there had been a few burglaries in the area but he was always confident if he did collapse someone would help because they kept a master key on the premises at all times			2
restricted : out of hours staff at @entity20 refused to give paramedics the code to access a master key			1
eventually mr @entity2 was taken to hospital , but later died of a heart attack ' when the paramedics did arrive they were talking to my dad through the letter box			1
' he was shouting ‘ for @entity93 ’s sake help me ’ but they had to explain they had to wait			2
' one of the paramedics called the operator of the complex to ask for the code to the key safe by the entrance but they would n’t give it to him			2
' apparently the operator said they could not be sure it really was the paramedic and it was therefore against company policy to hand the code out to them			0
anger : mr @entity2 's daughter , @entity52 said she was ' disgusted ' at the treatment her father received ' part of me thinks the paramedics should have kicked the door down but they were in a very difficult position			1
' you expect when your dad is in a housing complex they will make sure there is a fast way of getting into his room if he is in trouble but my dad was left stranded on the floor because of these jobsworths			2
' mr @entity2 , who had seven grandchildren and two great - grandchildren moved into the complex in 1999 after his wife @entity128 died of cancer aged 66			1
after his stroke on october 12 this year , he was taken to the @entity131 in @entity23 and later transferred to @entity132 where he suffered a fatal heart attack on october 21			1
mrs @entity52 , from @entity134 , @entity23 , said : ' i am disgusted at what my father had to go through during his final days			0
' he had been living in that complex since 1990 and was an able man , he did his own shopping and he drove his own car			0
' to think he was lying there helpless in his bedroom while the ambulance crew were on the other side of the door is shocking , no one should have to go through that			0
' i have had various people sending through their condolences but i want answers into why more could n’t have been done			0
' i am thankful for the @entity13 contacting the right people and trying to help my father , but after that , not enough was done for him			0
' he is and will be missed , he was a father - of - two , grandfather - of - seven , great - grandfather - of - two with one on the way that he never got the chance to hear about			0
' more needs to be done so that this does n’t happen to other families because we are very angry about what happened , we ’re furious			0
' when he first moved into the complex , there was a warden on site , although through the years the warden disappeared , maybe they should bring a warden back so these incidents can be dealt with quicker			0
