when on the @entity2 it was suggested to @entity4 manager @entity3 that the dvd of their thrashing at home by @entity9 would n't make very edifying viewing , the phlegmatic gaffer replied ' you can not pick what you like to watch '			1
well , if @entity3 tuned in to watch his centre half @entity13 on @entity15 on sunday evening , he might well have decided to pick up the dvd of that @entity9 game again , and stick it straight back in the recorder			1
playing against soap and @entity22 star @entity21 and her family , things were actually looking pretty good for the @entity24 at the start			1
as in , before they 'd actually started playing			0
@entity13 ( left ) appeared alongside his family in @entity15 , where his team lost heavily the @entity24 appeared to have got host @entity30 onside early , but soon lost their advantage the @entity33 hail from the @entity34 , while @entity13 was playing a flat back four of sister , brother , wife and mother - in - law from @entity40			1
this had the man in the middle , @entity44 's own @entity30 , immediately looking to favour the team from the @entity46			1
but even with the man in black in their pocket , the @entity24 were still about to have an absolute mare			0
and just like on saturday , it began badly , and just got worse			0
@entity13 was first up at the buzzer with @entity54			1
and on beating her to the ball , suggested that the thing you 'd hang onto when it was windy was ' a railing '			0
and our survey said ... well , i 'll leave you to do the noise			0
so the @entity65 nipped in , and nicked the lead			0
yet a couple of the @entity24 ' other answers - namely ' a child ' and ' the elderly ' - were n't far off , surely , from an actual correct answer ' somebody else ' ? @entity13 is brushed off the ball by @entity74 in one of two poor performances this week @entity3 did n't enjoy watching his side 's defeat to @entity9 , but @entity13 's tv appearance was even worse soap star @entity21 and her family made it a torrid weekend all round for the @entity4 midfielder frankly , the fact the @entity24 were n't surrounding the official on that one showed remarkable restraint on their part			1
then , before you could blink , the @entity88 had doubled their lead			0
and this time , it was very much through a @entity13 own goal			1
who , as we had seen earlier in the show - when discovering about him from his family on a home video they 'd made - has his own mini cinema and a grand piano in the front hall			2
so it 's not all bad , eh ? the challenge this time was to name a small bird			2
' @entity107 ' , said @entity13			1
@entity30 did his best for him			0
' compared to an ostrich ' was how he defended the defender 's answer , but suffice to say ... that noise again			1
yet amazingly , there was arguably worse to come			0
the next question had the @entity24 pondering a variety of potential trouser malfunctions you might have while wearing a pair at work			0
@entity13 shares a joke with the host , but he failed to produce the goods on the pitch or the telly this week i 'm writing this sentence here now to give you a bit of time to think about a few possible answers for yourselves			1
i 'll even point out , to give you a little more time , that @entity30 did acknowledge that wearing trousers at work was not exactly in @entity13 ' area of expertise			1
@entity13 said ' they 'd changed colour '			2
anyone else out there ? anyone ? frankly , this was turning into a rout			0
so even @entity13 was probably grateful when @entity30 took time out to ask everyone to join him for a song from @entity13 ' favourite musical - which happens to be the @entity148			2
that 's right , @entity13 's fellow footballers			1
just in case you think you might want to remind him of the fact next time you 're with him in a dressing room or on the field of play			0
the @entity4 defender did however manage to raise plenty of money for charity perhaps something along the lines of the fact that he clearly could n't @entity165 a house brick ? no , too much knowledge , that			1
@entity13 did finally get off the mark with a correct answer about lying on a dating website , but when you looked up at the scoreboard come the end of the game , it was still something like 581 the @entity88 , but most certainly the @entity24 close to nil			2
in the end then though , the plucky , affable footballer and his family still managed to raise money for their chosen charity			2
and did at least give it a bit of a go in the process			0
but all i can say if that if @entity3 had been in charge of this team 's performance , chances are he 'd have cleared his desk at the training ground and said goodbye to the players before you 'd even had the chance to read this			1
no big deal though , @entity13			2
put that one behind you			0
you can fix it in the next game			0
you 're away at only connect .			0

@entity13 took part in @entity15 on sunday night
@entity13 's team lost heavily to soap star @entity21 and her family
@entity4 defender put in a *terrible* performance throughout
