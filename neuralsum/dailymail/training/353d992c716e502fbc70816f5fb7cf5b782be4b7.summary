however , hope of this materialising before this month ’s deadline expires is shrouded in doubt			0
while the @entity37 have so far raised £ 500,000 , it needs to show that £ 800,000 is in its bank by the end of november for the deal to remain on track			2
with the prospect of fan - ownership seemingly dwindling , the @entity5 - based consortium have moved into the picture and have made their intentions known to key figures at the club			1

hinting at the possibility of an alternative takeover in its most recent news letter last month , the @entity37 stated : ‘ given we are very nearly at the cut - off point , we needed to act quickly to make sure that the club remains in the hands of @entity0 fans – there are no guarantees that will be the case if the @entity37 does not reach the funds required by the end of november			1
’ @entity31 announced in february 2011 that he was to stand down as chairman at @entity13 which would ‘ allow wider ownership and involvement in the club for all who care about it ’			0

@entity87 resigned as @entity0 boss after a poor run of form in the @entity91 despite the possibility of a takeover , the club are still searching for a successor for @entity87 as manager			2

last night , when asked if he would be interested in the job , he said : ‘ absolutely			0
everyone i ’ve spoken to over the years has told me it ’s a really good club			0
