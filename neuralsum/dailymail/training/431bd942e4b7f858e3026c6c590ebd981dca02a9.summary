his title as @entity13 means he becomes the owner of the assets of anyone living in the county of @entity18 who dies ‘ intestate ’ , meaning who dies without a will or known relations			1
last year this entitlement provided him with more than £ 450,000 and he is sitting on £ 3.3m in cash from years of collecting @entity26 legacies , according to latest accounts seen by the @entity28			2
in 2012 the benevolent fund he set up to use the money made its biggest grant of £ 20,000 to @entity1 ’s charity @entity32 , whose supporters include some of the biggest companies in @entity35			0
another of its largest grants was of £ 5,000 to @entity39 , the @entity9 public school , which @entity1 attended in 1962 and reportedly hated , and where a place now costs £ 30,000 a year			1
the money was provided to support bursaries for @entity26 children who otherwise would not be able to afford the fees			2
a total of £ 1,000 went to his @entity49 - based @entity48 , which backs the prince ’s controversial ideas about architecture and planning			0
his title as @entity13 means he becomes owner of assets of anyone in the county who dies intestate last year the foundation established a five - year partnership with the @entity61 to showcase the value of sustainable design , which has been championed by @entity1			1

@entity1 ’ title already lands him an £ 18m private annual income			2
the donations provided by deceased people in @entity18 have drawn particular criticism in the county			1
last night there were calls for the inheritances to be channelled into the public purse as they are in the rest of @entity86			0
@entity87 , a councillor in @entity88 , told the @entity89 was ‘ abusing the loyalty ’ of cornish people and the ‘ privilege ’ of receiving the intestate assets			1

’ @entity1 has also been criticised for only distributing £ 100,000 – less than a quarter of the assets received from the deceased last year			0
a @entity18 spokesman said all of the money received would eventually be given to charity – minus the administration costs – but all the money from donations comes in at different points in the year and so is not allocated immediately			0
@entity115 , director of @entity116 , the campaign for an elected @entity118 , added : ‘ @entity1 is sitting on those funds when they could be supporting the vital work of charities , many of whom are really struggling at the moment			0
