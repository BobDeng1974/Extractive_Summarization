when most of us make a spelling misteak , er , mistake , at work a quick tap on the delete button usually does the trick			2
but that option clearly was n’t available to road markers in @entity10 whose @entity12 error at the civic centre was gleefully reported by drivers			1
contractors have corrected the mistake , which appeared last week , free of charge , and @entity19 has apologised			2
ceear - ly wrong : a bemused passer - by stops to look at the spelling mistake at the @entity22 in @entity10 councillor @entity23 said : ' anybody can make a mistake			1
i think it is a genuine mistake , it does n’t look to be anything else			2
it really shows how hard the lads are working			2
' @entity32 , chairman of the council ’s @entity10 local committee , said : ' it ’s just a basic human error			0
' he added : ' i am sure most people would be aware of what it means , in spite of the spelling			0
meanwhile in @entity43 , gas workers have dug up road bricks with double yellow lines on before placing them back into the road in different positions - making one of the lines barely recognisable			1
the double yellow lines in now look more like a scene from classic computer puzzle game @entity53 after the @entity56 workers finished their handiwork last friday			1
and until the surface was put back to normal yesterday , drivers were left unsure of the parking restrictions			1
road markings on a @entity43 street ended up looking more like a game of @entity53 than double yellow lines after builders bodged the job of relaying the bricks the jumbled road markings resemble vintage video game @entity53 , but @entity56 says it has put them right computer classic : a modern version of the game called @entity74 is pictured , available for free on @entity75 one of the world 's most popular computer games , @entity53 first appeared in 1984			1
it was created by @entity80 programmer @entity79 while was studying computer science in @entity82			0
the catchy theme tune was based on a 19th century @entity80 folk song called ' @entity85 ' , before it was arranged by @entity86 - also behind the music in @entity88			0
it is notoriously addictive - and a condition called the @entity91 was named after the game to explain when people spend so much time doing something that it begins to pattern their thoughts and dreams			0
@entity53 was said to have got its name from the ' tetra ' prefix in ' tetramino ' - a geometric shape made of four squares , connected at right angles to each other - and ' tennis ' , mr @entity79 's favourite sport			0
one passerby , speaking before the bricks had been fixed , said : ' it looks as if someone has left a trail of scrambled egg down the street			1
' i ca n't see how they can enforce the parking restrictions until they get some new double yellow lines painted			1
' another bystander , also speaking before the works were complete , said : ' they could get the contractors to rearrange all the bricks , but i think that might be rather expensive and i doubt they could figure it out			1
' it 's probably far easier for the council to paint some new double yellows			0
it should n't take them long , after all they 've had enough practice			0
' they 'd better hurry up though			0
this is not a very wide road and if a couple of drivers decide to take advantage it could cause traffic chaos			2
' a @entity145 spokesman said that the works had been completed four and a half weeks ahead of schedule by @entity56			0
although parking restrictions in the area remained in force throughout , no - one received a ticket over the weekend			1
and @entity56 said that the jumbled surface , which have now been fixed , were all part of a plan to ensure a professional and even finish			0
a spokesman for the firm , which is currently upgrading 0.75 miles of metal gas mains in @entity160 , said the lines were fixed yesterday so as not to cause disruption during the busy weekend - and the existing yellow marks were burned off before yellow lines were repainted .			2

@entity43 gas workers put road surfacing bricks back in the wrong order
*motorists* left confused over whether they would get a parking ticket
*onlookers* compare the *unusual* road markings to ' scrambled egg '
