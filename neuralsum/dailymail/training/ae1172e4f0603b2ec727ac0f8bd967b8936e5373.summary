an artist has managed to turn the most unlikely of places into her own personal yoga studio by striking poses in the streets of the world 's busiest cities			1
in @entity12 , @entity7 , @entity8 and in her native @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 has been surprising passers - by with her flexible routines			1
@entity11 , a yoga teacher of 12 years and former top athlete , decided to embark on her scheme over the last year and has now produced a book of her work called the @entity19			1
together they created this amazing series of photographs that make the daily commute look tame in comparison			0
@entity11 , 31 , says that the project came from a desire to explore the human body 's relationship with the city			1
' the photos are picturing my journey as an architect and a yogi using @entity47 to explore alternative ways of understanding the relationship between the urban environment and our sensuous body			0
the 31 - year - old has posed demonstrating her strength and flexibility in @entity12 ( pictured ) @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity10 's @entity9 @entity11 hopes to communicate the harmony between human beings and the urban environment through her gravity - defying yoga poses @entity11 said that the reaction she received from passers - by varied from city to city ' photos were taken during the course of one year in places i worked as a freelance architect and designer : @entity12 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			1
' every city featured in @entity47 photo series has a special place in my heart and shaped me as a researcher in architecture			0
' @entity11 says that the image produced was as much influenced by each of the photographers as they were by her posing			1
' choosing the location depended on the photographer , the city and the time of the year			0
i had been always excited to hear the ideas of the photographer and i enjoyed trying them out			0
@entity11 , who practised yoga for the photo series in a footless white leotard , chose locations where she had worked before as a freelance architect for each pose @entity11 aimed to ' connect , intertwine and mimic the urban space ' , which in this case mean a handstand between boxes on a truck here @entity11 , who worked with four photographers , becomes part of the view from the @entity100 development on to @entity12 's @entity101 ' so the final photo was a synergy between the photographer and myself			1
sometimes we chose locations as we strolled through the city and sometimes in advance			0
' with those chosen in advance , it sometimes happened that as we got there and tried them out we realised that they did not work at all			0
' when it came to deciding where and how to pose the final result was anything but random with @entity11 carefully considering the message she wanted to convey			1
@entity11 demonstrates her physical strength as she hangs from metal bars , here just below a basketball hoop in a heavily - graffitied environment @entity11 thought long and hard about how her poses , such as sinuously dangling from scaffolding , could best convey her message of urban unity ' as far as the poses are concerned , my aim was to connect , intertwine and mimic the urban space , so that the photos functioned as a metaphor for the fact that while moving through space , we subconsciously mimic and measure spatial configuration			1
' moreover , to invite people to surrender to urban space with their whole sensuous body and give themselves up to feelings that are running through it			0
' @entity11 added that she found it fascinating to see different reactions in the different countries she visited			2
' it had been also very interesting to observe people in different cities and how they react towards the making of @entity47			2
' in @entity12 , for example , they saw it as a spectacle , stopping their cars to take pictures , making traffic congestions , clapping as we finished finished the shot			2
' in @entity8 , on the the contrary , it seemed as if none cared at all , so it was much easier to focus			2
in @entity9 , people were amazed , but , they were standing there and observing quietly			1
' ' in @entity7 people were really helpful watching over me so i do not fall or get hurt , which was really sweet			1
' as well as posing outdoors , @entity11 also practiced some of her positions inside homes , here emerging from a large white bathtub the images will be displayed in the @entity173 a publication that sees a collection of the artist 's images @entity11 says that one of her favourite places to pose was her home town in @entity10 as she had a more interactive audience			1
' it was also a bit different , because it is my home town so many people we knew were passing by and together we were making jokes , which made the shooting lots of fun			0
' the yogi hopes that her project will help communicate her message of unity between humans and the urban landscape			2
' as a yoga teacher of 12 years i based my practice on the notion that our guiding principle is to live in harmony with ourselves as well as with the environment - any environment			2
' thus , i believe urban landscape should not be regarded as something , which disturbs our harmony , but rather as a vital element that contributes to it			0
' architecture with all its constructive fields makes up the urban landscape - the city , the inescapable environment of contemporary humans			0
this is where @entity47 steps in			0
' @entity11 's book was successfully funded on @entity216 and should be available by the end of march			2
