the former @entity8 midfielder insists the players will benefit psychologically from ending the club ’s nine - year wait for a trophy			2
nobody in the squad has lifted silverware in @entity8 before			0
@entity0 won three league titles , four @entity17 , and one @entity18 during his 12 - year career at @entity1 and knows how success breeds success			1
@entity0 , who left the summer before that @entity6 triumph , also played for @entity31 and says a win for @entity34 ’s team would make history – but it would affect the future for @entity1			1

‘ it would be really bad if that continued			0
i ’m not sure what effect that might have			0
the @entity45 : @entity0 believes the @entity46 will challenge for the title if they win the @entity6 ‘ but on the other side , winning the @entity6 would give players that confidence and belief			1

slip up ? @entity1 face underdogs @entity31 in the @entity6 final at @entity74 on saturday we all know what @entity26 has been working with at the club , the new stadium meant he had to balance the books and could n’t compete with the elite clubs in @entity81 on fees and wages			1
