for someone comfortable to let the spotlight shine on others , @entity0 is probably in two minds about being regarded as the new must - have accessory for all the @entity7 's top clubs			1
but he ca n't avoid the truth any longer			0
having just celebrated his 29th birthday with two @entity12 goals against @entity13 at the weekend , @entity0 's stock has never been higher			1
he is one of the stars of the season			0
@entity19 , with all their injury problems and squad restrictions , could n't have done without him this season			2
rivals like @entity21 and @entity22 covet him			2
and as his contract at the @entity25 runs into the final six months , @entity0 's bargaining position has never been stronger			1
@entity19 midfielder @entity0 has yet to sign a new deal to stay with the reigning champions @entity0 has been called many things in his career since scoring his first @entity7 goal for @entity31 at 16			1
he 's versatile , having played at full back , holding midfield , right wing , left wing , no 10 and now striker following injuries to @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			2
once seen as a weakness - ' @entity40 , master of none ' - it is now a strength			0
he 's also been mocked for being ' boring ' , even poking fun at himself for his image			0
all because he is teetotal and prefers to play golf rather than be photographed in celebrity hang - outs on his days off			0
@entity0 has attracted interest from @entity22 with his contract running out at the end of the season the @entity54 international pictured celebrating his 17th birthday with former @entity31 manager @entity56 @entity0 , who left @entity31 in 2004 , holds up a cake on his 17th birthday with former manager @entity56 here 's the breakdown of @entity0 's host of positions playing for @entity19 in 27 appearances in all competitions this season : @entity64 ( right ) - 5 @entity64 ( left ) - 5 forward / striker - 4 attacking midfield ( left ) - 2 @entity64 ( centre ) - 1 substitute appearances - 10 but if these are flaws , @entity69 and @entity70 are two of countless managers prepared to accept them			1
they would prefer their players to be boring rather than getting into controversy through boozing , smoking or problematic exchanges on social media			0
they also know in an era where clubs are restricted to 25 players in their @entity7 squad ( and 21 for @entity19 in the @entity82 this season due to @entity85 penalties ) @entity0 is even more valuable because he is five players in one			1
@entity0 is in an incredibly strong position as he prepares to enter his 30s			2
@entity19 have recently played @entity0 as a striker , seen here against @entity91 wednesday on sunday the 29 - year - old in action against @entity94 for @entity95 , where he played from 2004 - 2008 in the @entity82 against @entity96 was deployed wide left in an attacking role during the 3 - 2 win against @entity99 in the @entity100 played wide left again for @entity19 @entity0 enjoyed a successful loan spell at @entity102 before joining in 2008 for two seasons the 29 - year - old played wide right in the @entity19 midfield against @entity95 in the @entity106 he has shown before at @entity31 , @entity95 and @entity102 that he is strong enough to end up with what he wants and while very happy in the environment at @entity19 , he will seek assurances from @entity110 about the amount of matches he will play next season before committing himself to a new deal			1
@entity0 has helped out his manager this season when others have been unable to play but the memory of being left out of last season 's @entity106 final at @entity120 runs deep			1
having spent £ 25million on @entity123 last summer , the prospect of landing @entity0 for nothing will be mouthwatering for @entity22 boss @entity70 and the club 's moneyball owners			1
after @entity126 and @entity127 , he would be easy for the club 's overworked pr department too			0
city manager @entity110 put @entity0 in central midfield to face @entity131 in the @entity82 @entity19 remain confident that @entity0 , scoring against @entity13 , will sign a new deal @entity69 would see @entity0 as a positive influence on his young @entity135 players @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and others			1
on the pitch , he would give 100 per cent effort , has match intelligence and knows how to distribute the ball to keep attacking momentum			0
even @entity145 at @entity146 will be wondering if politically he can sign a former @entity19 player			2
@entity31 have also had severe injury problems this season and @entity0 is the type you want in the squad when that happens			2
the problem will be persuading @entity19 to let their asset leave early			0
their £ 30m pursuit of @entity156 does mean sacrifices will have to be made elsewhere in their squad to fit in with @entity85 restrictions			0
@entity0 runs over to the @entity19 fans and celebrates after scoring twice on sunday in the @entity12 getting £ 5m now for @entity0 would be one option but it 's hard to think that would make sense from @entity110 's point of view given the player 's form and importance to the dressing room			1
he is also one of the five association - trained players @entity19 need to fill their quota in their @entity82 squad and you know the boss would rather have @entity0 there than @entity177 , for example			1
when @entity37 ( knee ) and @entity39 ( calf ) left @entity19 bereft of a centre - forward at the start of december , there were plenty of doom - and - gloom merchants who thought their challenge was over at home and abroad			2
instead , @entity110 asked @entity0 to play up front , and the way he created space for the likes of @entity193 and @entity194 meant the good results continued			0
city are now unbeaten in 12 games , joint top of the @entity7 and have @entity199 next up in @entity200			0
life is anything but dull and for those clubs who want @entity0 , they face a wait of at least six months .			0
