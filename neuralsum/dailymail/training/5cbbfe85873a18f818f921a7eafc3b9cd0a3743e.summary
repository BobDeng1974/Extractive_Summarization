@entity0 is far more interested in winning races than popularity contests			1
still , the @entity4 sprinter with a doping history does n't quite understand the backlash over his nomination for track and field athlete of the year			1
@entity0 went undefeated in the 100 and 200 meters this season , a year that did n't include a major meet and one in which @entity12 chose to give his nagging injuries time to heal			1
@entity0 has been nominated as track and field athlete of the year despite his doping past @entity0 ( left ) powers ahead during the @entity19 meeting at @entity20 in july but @entity0 's inclusion for track 's annual award has angered some athletes			1
so much so that @entity26 discus champion @entity25 even withdrew from consideration			1
@entity0 insisted again and again in an interview with the @entity29 that he 's served his time - four years for testing positive for excessive testosterone in 2006 - and should be at least considered , especially after going 18 - 0			1
his reaction to those showing so much displeasure is this : why over an award ? why not after he captured a bronze medal at the @entity37 or silver at the 2013 world championships ? ' not a peep , then			2
not a stir , ' @entity0 said			1
' i do n't make any waves			2
i do n't say anything bad about anybody			2
i do n't point fingers			2
' i 'm sad to say that a lot of people out there feel that , " once a doper , always a doper			2
" but that makes no sense			0
that means you do n't believe your system is working			0
' the 32 - year - old sprinter said he 's been tested often by @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity19 , the governing body of track			1
skepticism remains , though , as when he finished in 9.77 seconds in @entity62 last month , a mark achieved only by the world - record holder bolt , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			0
that 's also the time @entity0 was running in 2006 , when he tested positive			1
gatlin in 2006 , the year he was banned by the @entity69 @entity0 celebrates winning the men 's 100m sprint in @entity72 , @entity73 in september to continue his superb year ' for some reason in an off year , when i run 9.77 with no medal of any sort , and now i get all of this backlash ? ' @entity0 said			1
' i guess people feel like if my two feet get me across the line in first , that 's good enough			0
but they do n't want me to win a popularity contest			0
' there was originally a 10 - man list of nominees for the award issued by @entity19 , until @entity25 took his name out of the running , with the @entity91 telling @entity90 magazine , ' it 's insulting for me and my fans			1
' the winner is announced next month			0
' i did n't ask to get nominated , ' @entity0 said			1
' my choice was to run and win races and be dominant for myself			0
my job is not to go out and lose			0
my job is to win			0
that 's what i 'm supposed to do , like everyone else nominated			2
' in the middle year of an @entity26 cycle and with no world championships this summer , @entity0 overhauled his training program			1
he ate healthier and slimmed down to 175 pounds			0
he also fine - tuned his technique in @entity104			0
for as fast as he runs , though , his past always catches up			2
a number of @entity107 meets wo n't include him because of his history			0
the 2004 @entity26 champion tested positive for amphetamines in 2001 , but arbitrators decided @entity0 did n't take it to cheat and that doctors prescribed it to treat attention deficit disorder first diagnosed when he was 9			1
' stopped taking it cold turkey right then , once i tested positive , ' said @entity0 , a former star at the @entity117			2
@entity0 ( right ) attempts to chase down @entity12 as the @entity4 claimed bronze at @entity119 @entity26 discus champion @entity25 has removed himself of the running for athlete of the year five years later , he tested positive again , this time for testosterone			1
@entity69 and the @entity19 pushed for an eight - year ban			1
' i took my lumps , sat my time down , came back and worked hard to make my way back to the top , ' he said			0
when he returned in 2010 , @entity0 was running 10.26			1
as he lowered his time , he increased his detractors			0
that did n't bother him			0
this insinuation , however , did : at the @entity134 , researchers gave mice testosterone - the same hormone for which @entity0 tested positive - and found the resulting super-mice developed muscle changes and performance benefits that lasted long after doping stopped			1
' for the few haters out there , seems like that 's what they want to do , discredit my name and label me with laboratory rats in @entity149 , and say , " oh , steroids are in you system for decades and decades , " ' @entity0 said			2
' a lot of athletes that tested positive , they never came back and ran times close to the times they ran when they were positive			0
i think that proves hard work and dedication on my behalf			0
' i 'm not doing anything that 's a secret to anybody			0
i 'm just going out there and believing in myself			0
