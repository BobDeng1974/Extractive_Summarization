yesterday details of @entity2 's latest bargain brassiere sent shoppers in to a spin as the company boasted that it expected to sell over one million units			2
featuring a sensible design and a £ 1 price tag the nylon bra may lack the style and sex appeal of costlier rivals but is expected to fly off the shelves after trials of the ‘ comfort bra ’ in selected shops last weekend proved a huge success , with almost 100,000 snapped up in hours			1
@entity2 bosses are expecting to sell over one million units by introducing the design in more than 200 branches nationwide , where it will be sold alongside their more established ranges of sweets , toys and toiletries			0
the bra comes in black , white and nude nylon and sizes range from medium to extra large and the manufacturer claims the curve - hugging design gives women the perfect fit and a smooth shape with no bumps or lumps			1
but does it really work ? and will any woman with a bust size bigger than an a cup actually wear it ? we asked banker @entity41 , 26 , from @entity42 and @entity43 , a 33 - year - old barrister and mother - of - three from @entity45 , to take it for a spin			0
she said : ' it 's more of a top than a bra			1
surprisingly the fabric feels fine , not too cheap and nasty , but i 'm not convinced			0
normally the only thing i buy in pound shops is bleach			0
' when asked if she would wear it after the trial in the @entity68 offices she said : ' absolutely no way , it 's not very sexy is it ? ' ' my verdict is , it 's not at all sexy , but i might possibly wear it for the gym because the support is ok			1
' not so sexy : ' it 's not very sexy is it ? ' retorted @entity41 whilst donning the bra ' comfort wise , it 's wonderful			1
it feels like you 're not wearing anything , which i think is part of the problem			0
i like my bras to do something ! ' ' but it is great value for money , ' she added			0
@entity43 , a 33 - year - old barrister and mother - of - three , however , was impressed			0
she described the bra , which comes in black , white and nude nylon , as packaged in a simple way not unlike many you see in supermarkets			1
she said : ' it is a crop top / sports bra style			2
i have 38e breasts so chose the @entity97 which is sized as 16 - 18			1
' it was plenty big enough to cover me			0
very easy to put on			0
the material is soft and comfortable but fairly thin ( this could cause some embarrassment in cold weather ! )			0
road test : the bras are only available in black , white or nylon and are expected to sell millions supportive : as @entity41 jumped around , she agreed that the bra was very supportive flattering ? the bra claims to be flattering and help with posture but @entity41 felt like she was n't wearing anything at all ' it only offers modest support - a quick skip across the garden with my 3 - year - old daughter made it clear that any running in it would cause too much discomfort			1
tried and tested : @entity43 , a 33 - year - old barrister and mother - of - three , put the £ 1 bra to the test and she was impressed ' having said that , i have a large chest and it gave a relatively decent lift and cleavage so i expect a smaller breasted woman would be more suited to it			1
' the manufacturer claims the curve - hugging design gives women the perfect fit and a smooth shape with no bumps or lumps			2
@entity43 said : ' it 's not the prettiest bra but that style of bra never is in my opinion			1
' i would n't wear it to feel sexy but it is n't ugly			0
' i was wearing it on a very warm day and it did n't feel uncomfortable or cause me to feel too warm			0
' @entity43 , who normally buys bras from @entity146 and @entity148 's limited collection or autograph range ( @entity2 boasts that its bra is £ 14 cheaper than the lowest - priced @entity146 rival ) , concluded : ' for £ 1 i was impressed i have to say			1
' i 've tried on bras in that style when pregnant ( as you ca n't have underwire ) at a cost of £ 10 - £ 15 and it was on a par with them			2
' it says to hand wash which is a bit inconvenient and i have n't washed it to know how it would hold up but it looks relatively well made			0
' if you are on a budget and you do n't need too much support i 'd say give it a go ! ' the retailer admits it will make a loss on the product , but hopes it will lure more women into its stores			2
however , it can not claim to be the cheapest bra to go on sale in the @entity174			2
two years ago , the 99p @entity176 chain sold a padded bra with decorative bow in 150 branches nationwide			2
it 's a no from me : @entity41 said she would ' absolutely never wear the bra ' tried and tested : the new bra has been trialled in selected stores and will go on sale nationwide today cheap cheap : the bra is £ 14 cheaper than @entity146 's cheapest support bra and targets cash - strapped women			1

£ 14 cheaper than @entity146 's lowest price support bra
100,000 women snapped one up at trial sale
nylon bra available in black , white and natural tone and medium to @entity97
