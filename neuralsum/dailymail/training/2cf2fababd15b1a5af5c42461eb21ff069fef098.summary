photographer @entity44 , 34 , said it was ' amazing ' to capture the birds hunting above the bustling cities			1
' there is something amazing about seeing one of the world 's fastest animals perched on a building you see every day , ' he said			1
' there are plenty of tall buildings in cities for the birds to perch on			0
' mid-flight : but the birds are usually spotted in the skies above mountain ranges and wild cliffs in remote areas incredible : photographer @entity44 , who has been tracking and photographing urban falcons for the past two years , said it was ' amazing ' to capture the birds in @entity7			1
above , a peregrine falcon flies over @entity13 ' perfect habitat ' : ' we have unwittingly created the perfect habitat for the falcons in @entity7 , ' said the 34 - year - old mr @entity44 , who has been tracking and photographing urban falcons in @entity13 and @entity14 for the past two years , said the birds had been attracted to the cities because of their large number of pigeons and other migratory birds			1
' i have seen falcons doing things they do n't do in the countryside , ' he said			0
' for example , i witnessed them hunting at night			0
' the falcons were using the city lights to spot other birds and then swooping on them			0

above , a falcon on a perch ' we are used to seeing nocturnal hunting behavior in owls , but not peregrines			0

' he added that march was a good month for photographing the birds - saying : ' we are coming up to the time when falcons lay their first eggs of the year			0
' males are particularly territorial during this time , and attack other birds like seagulls which come anywhere near their nests			0
' a couple of years ago two falcons in @entity13 only managed to lay one egg , and a seagull knocked it into the floating harbour			2
some workmen managed to fish it out with an umbrella , and it was saved			0
' mr @entity44 said he had captured the falcons from vantage points on high buildings - while carefully observing their nesting habits to determine where they will appear			2
' i stood on top of a car park all day , waiting for something to happen , ' he said			0
' from the pictures you would think these are really active birds , but often i sit there watching them perched on a ledge , digesting their food all day			0
' @entity143 , features editor at @entity145 , said peregrines have undergone a ' spectacular renaissance ' in @entity7 - and have been attracted to cities because of their ' suitable prey '			1
' there is plenty of suitable prey here , especially pigeons , and lots of nest sites too - a high ledge or flat roof is a perfect substitute for a cliff , ' he said			2
' the falcons have even learned to hunt after dark using the glow from streetlights , targeting the migratory birds that fly over our cities at night			1

but , today these fabulous birds of prey nest in full view in many @entity7 cities , often on cathedral towers or other tall landmarks			2
' i see a pair of peregrines most days in central @entity13 on my walk to work , and delighted local office workers love to follow the birds ' progress as they raise a family			0
' the birds seem remarkably tolerant of all the noise going on around them - once i saw the male peregrine perched on the end of a tower crane on a building site , completely oblivious as it swung through 90 degrees			0
