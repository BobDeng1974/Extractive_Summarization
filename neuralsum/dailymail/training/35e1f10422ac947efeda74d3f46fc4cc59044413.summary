by @entity0 my new best friend has some advice for me			1
' do n’t take yourself too seriously , ' says @entity5 , a pretty 28 - year - old dance instructor who has just stepped into my life			1
' if you do n’t quite understand what i ’m doing , keep moving			2
' it ’s an order , rather than a request , but it ’s delivered so sweetly – a peculiar mixture of authority and concern , like a country policeman who ’s just found the local headmaster whose satnav has sent him the wrong way – that i do my best to obey			2
i ’m at my very first zumba class – and @entity5 is my teacher			1
i ’ve spent the last five years of my life walking past leaflets and posters advertising this fitness craze , and now finally i ’ve succumbed			1
fish out of water : @entity26 , centre , went to his first zumba class - and says he seemed to be going in one direction while everyone else went in the other i call it a craze			1
but it ’s gone way beyond that			2
invented nearly 20 years ago by a @entity38 dance choreographer named @entity39 , zumba is now practised all over the world			1
it ’s estimated that 140 million people have taken part in zumba – a dance fitness programme , based around @entity47 music – in 185 countries			1
yet , here in @entity51 at least , there are precious few men who do it			2
' i do n’t know why men come to zumba so rarely , ' says @entity5 , who has taught just a ' handful ' of chaps in the three years she ’s been holding regular classes			1
' i ’m always telling men that it was a bloke who invented it			2
' i ’m in @entity62 , a beautiful market town in the county of @entity64			2
glorious sandstone and limestone buildings line the streets and market square			2
but i ’m cocooned inside a bright , shiny gymnasium – and there ’s fast , rhythmic music pounding from the speakers			0
meanwhile , @entity5 is pointing to her shoulders , pointing to her toes , imploring us – gently , kindly – to leap here , clap there , and jump to our left and right while waving our arms to the right and the left			0
( so confusing ! )			0
getting stuck in : instructor @entity5 , left , told @entity0 to let himself go and not to worry if people are watching - and @entity26 says by the end of the class , he manages just that my heart is beating , my legs and arms are moving			1
just not necessarily in the same direction as @entity5 ’s			0
put it like this : if she ’s @entity93 , i ’m @entity94			1
but does it matter ? let ’s say that , at the start of the class , i have n’t yet made up my mind			1
so why have i come to this particular zumba class ? @entity64 is @entity51 ’s smallest county ( there are just two towns , and not a single city , within it ) but it is part of a big , bold challenge			1
earlier this month , more than 100 local residents turned up early on a crisp winter morning to a public hall in the neighbouring town of @entity109			0
they ’d all been invited along to have their blood cholesterol measured			1
if their cholesterol was above the government ’s recommended level , they were asked if they wanted to take part in a community challenge			1
the plan was see whether , working in concert with their friends and neighbours , a whole community ( or at least a good chunk of it ) could collectively lower its cholesterol			1
* the volunteers agreed to alter their diets – fewer saturated fats , please , and more fruit and vegetables – and exercise more			0
they ’d also consume products from the @entity134 pro.activ range – which has been shown to lower cholesterol when consumed as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle *			1
community spirit : the class was arranged by @entity134 as part of its initiative to reduce cholesterol among residents of @entity64			1
' this is a close - knit part of the world , ' says one			1
' people pull together ' then , three weeks after they started , the local residents will have their cholesterol measured again – and see how well they ’ve done			2
the zumba class attendees here today seem to like the way this health challenge – individuals joining together to achieve a common good – has brought the community closer			1
' this is a close - knit part of the world			2
people pull together , ' says 66 - year - old former @entity162 teacher @entity160			0
it ’s clear local people are taking the challenge seriously			2
it ’s 10am on a tuesday morning but the people here are not the usual zumba suspects but ordinary folk from all walks of life , in all shapes and sizes			0
i chat to women in their 40s , 50s and 60s ; fit folk who take plenty of exercise anyway to larger types who are new to zumba			0
one by one , the locals have lined up to tell me that it does n’t matter that i think i ca n’t dance			0
so does the chap who ’s been sent along by @entity189 to make sure we ’ve all got what we need			0
and the amazing thing is that a few minutes into the class , i realise the truth : so what if i do n’t keep up with every step ? my eyes are fixed on @entity5 and her instructions			2
and – crucially – so are everybody else ’s			0
no one is spending a moment watching my dancing , how i ’m getting on			0
it takes all your concentration to keep your own show on the road			0
there ’s no time to pass judgment on others			0
so , i follow @entity5 ’s advice			0
if i get a step wrong , i just keep moving			0
and no one notices apart from @entity216 soon even i stop caring about that			0
at the end , i feel hot , sweaty – and like i ’ve achieved something			0
@entity5 says i ’ve done jolly well			0
and even if i do n’t believe her , i ’ve ended up rather enjoying myself			0
how did i allow that to happen ? * @entity189 contains plant sterols , which have been shown to lower blood cholesterol : scientific tests demonstrate that consuming 1.5 - 2.4g of plant sterols per day can lower cholesterol by 7 - 10 % in 2 - 3 weeks when consumed as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle with sufficient fruit and vegetables .			1
