it started out as a simple disagreement between neighbours over when to open and shut a gate on their shared driveway			1
but three years – and £ 100,000 later – the two middle - class couples have been criticised by a judge after their quarrel , which could have been solved for about £ 5,000 , ended up as a bitter feud in court			1
mr @entity11 said he was surprised that retired construction firm director @entity12 , 73 , and his wife , @entity14 , 67 , and retired teachers @entity16 and @entity17 had been unable to sit around a table and work out a solution			1
' prisoners in our own home ' : @entity12 and @entity23 said that they did n't want to ' roll over ' because giving the @entity24 control of their £ 650,000 five - bedroom property would be make it difficult to sell in the future centre of the dispute : the gates at the entrance to the driveway which is shared by the neighbours in @entity35 , @entity36			1
the @entity24 ' elegant £ 700,000 @entity38 villa , pictured , is at the front of the site instead they had spent what mr @entity12 called a ‘ sickening ’ amount paying lawyers to take the argument to court			1
after a three - day hearing in @entity51 in may , the @entity48 judge in @entity49 yesterday ruled a partial victory for the @entity24 , who will be allowed to lock the gates on the driveway to their properties in @entity35 , @entity36 , between 11pm and 7.30am			2
but he agreed with the @entity58 that the most sensible answer – and much cheaper than legal action – would have been to install a set of electronic gates			0
mr @entity12 last night said the whole dispute had left him feeling ill. ‘ we ’ve spent a sickening amount of money on this and the @entity24 have too , but once the legal machine is rolling it ’s impossible to get off without giving in , ’ he said			1
‘ we ’re determined to fight until a judge finally sees through the claptrap and orders for electronic gates to be installed			0
‘ that has been the obvious solution all along , but for some reason the @entity24 have refused point blank to have them			0
lawyers : retired teacher @entity78 and his wife @entity79 instructed solicitors after mr @entity12 padlocked one of the gates permanently open ‘ a set of electronic gates would have cost around £ 5,000 , but with the amount we ’ve already spent we could have had a pair of gold - plated gates by now			1
’ mr @entity12 said they did n’t want to ‘ roll over ’ because giving the @entity24 control of access to their £ 650,000 five - bedroom property would make it difficult to sell in future			1
he added : ‘ forcing the gates to be shut at night is a partial victory for them			2
we do feel like prisoners in our own home			0
’ problems began in august 2011 when the @entity24 , who have lived in an elegant £ 700,000 @entity38 villa for 28 years , began routinely shutting the front gate for security reasons following a break - in at a neighbouring property			1
the @entity58 ’ home , which sits directly behind the @entity24 ’ back garden and swimming pool , can only be accessed by a driveway down the side via a shared set of 4ft - wide wrought iron gates			0
they claimed that shutting the gates to their property , which they have owned since 2006 , was inconvenient and dangerous because they would have to stop and park the car at the roadside each time they came home			0
mr @entity12 claims he spoke to mr @entity78 , 67 , who agreed to look into getting a quote for electronic gates			1
but he said the @entity24 took umbrage when , in december 2011 , after months of inaction , the @entity58 got a quote themselves			0
things came to a head in august 2012 when , following no further progress , mr @entity12 padlocked one of the gates permanently open			2
this was the last time either couple spoke to each other and led to the @entity24 instructing solicitors			0
mrs @entity135 said : ‘ we offered to pay for electronic gates in full but they just wo n’t have it			2
’ she said the @entity24 had offered one objection after another to electronic gates , including fears that children would destroy post left in a mail box outside			0
she added : ‘ now i think it ’s all about saving face			0
’ the judge said : ‘ @entity151 neighbours would have sat round a table and worked out either a regime for closing the gates at agreed hours or the installation of remotely - operated electric gates			2
’ last night the @entity24 were unavailable for comment			0
shut : the @entity159 ' home sits directly behind the @entity24 ’ back garden and swimming pool , and can only be accessed by a driveway via a shared set of 4ft - wide wrought iron gates , which they claim are dangerous			2

@entity12 and @entity135 share a drive with @entity16 and @entity17
the neighbours could not agree when to shut the gate at the entrance
their quarrel , which could have been solved for £ 5,000 , ended up in court
