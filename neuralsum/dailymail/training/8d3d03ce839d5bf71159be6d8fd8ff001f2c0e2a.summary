doctors and nurses were given a green light yesterday to take a hand in killing desperately sick or disabled patients			1
@entity5 , the director of public prosecutions , said that rules which say doctors , medical workers and carers should be prosecuted for helping patients to commit suicide are wrong			1
in future , she said lawyers at the @entity14 should only bring charges when the doctor or carer ‘ may have exerted some influence on the victim ’			1
her order to @entity14 lawyers brought furious condemnation from anti-euthanasia campaigners who accused mrs @entity5 of legalising assisted suicide and opening the way for suicide hospitals in @entity27 on the model of the @entity30 clinic in @entity31			1
@entity5 ' order to @entity14 lawyers has sparked outrage among anti-euthanasia campaigners the @entity35 group said : ‘ she is effectively at a stroke of her pen decriminalising assisted suicide by doctors and other health care professionals as long as they do n’t have an existing relationship with the patient			1
’ the @entity5 was also accused of changing the law to allow doctors to help suicides without reference to @entity46 or even the courts			2
the switch in prosecution policy , announced in a @entity14 statement yesterday afternoon , comes at a time when peers and mps are set to debate a bill aimed precisely at democratic reform of the law so that doctors can kill terminally ill patients			1
@entity60 ’s @entity59 , due to go to its committee stage in the @entity62 next month , would allow doctors to provide lethal drugs to someone who has been diagnosed as terminally ill and who is expected to die within six months			2
two doctors would have to sign that the death was above board			2
however the @entity5 ’s ruling yesterday appears to free doctors from the threat of prosecution even if the patient they kill is not already dying from a terminal illness			1
the law on assisted suicide , laid down by @entity46 in 1961 , sets a maximum jail sentence of 14 years for anyone who aids and abets a suicide			2
this was effectively amended in 2010 by @entity82 ’ predecessor as @entity5 , @entity83 , who was asked to write prosecution guidelines in a @entity62 test case decision			2
@entity5 , director of public prosecutions , has said prosecutions should only be brought when the carer has exerted influence over the patient 's decision to commit suicide the result of mr @entity83 ’s guidelines is that no - one has been prosecuted for helping a @entity95 travel to die at the @entity30 clinic , even though many of the 150 @entity31 @entity27 suicides have had help from relatives or friends			1
the @entity103 rules mean in practice that no - one will be prosecuted unless they help to kill someone out of greed or malice			2
the 2010 guidelines said that prosecutions should be brought against medical professionals and carers where ‘ the victim was in his or her care			1
’ mrs @entity5 ’ new rule follows rulings by the @entity118 and the @entity119 in the case of @entity121 , a paralysed stroke victim who died in 2012 , but who had asked the courts to allow someone to kill him by injecting him with a lethal drug			0
the @entity118 judges hinted in june that they favoured assisted suicide but drew back from telling @entity46 that the 1961 law breaks @entity130 human rights rules			1
the @entity5 said her new guideline was made ‘ in the light of the recent comments of the @entity118			0
’ she said prosecutors should in future concentrate on the words ‘ the victim was in his or her care ’			0
she also added her own footnote to the @entity103 rules , which said that no medical professional should be prosecuted ‘ merely because someone was acting in a professional capacity			0
’ they should consider prosecuting only when there was ‘ a relationship of care between the suspect and the victim such that it will be necessary to consider whether the suspect may have exerted some influence on the victim			0
’ mrs @entity5 said that assisted suicide is ‘ an emotive subject on which many hold strong views and these cases present difficult and complex decisions for prosecutors			0
’ she added that ‘ nothing in these guidelines offers immunity against prosecution			0
’ but the @entity35 campaign said : ‘ this is very concerning			0
‘ it weakens the protections for sick and vulnerable people and signals to anyone in @entity130 wanting physician assisted suicide that @entity27 is open for business , opening the door to a @entity30 style death clinic being set up in the @entity27			1
it is an invitation to doctors who wish to push the boundaries and assist people who are not their patients to kill themselves to have free rein and go ahead			1
’ campaign director dr @entity180 added : ‘ such a facility could now be staffed by so - called health care professionals , who could assist in terminating the lives of disabled , terminally ill and vulnerable people with impunity			0
‘ the dpp ’s job is to administer the law not usurp the democratic authority of @entity46 , which is due to discuss this issue in just a couple of weeks time			0
she is acting way beyond her brief and effectively decriminalising physician assisted suicide by stealth			0

anti-euthanasia campaigners fear the new prosecution policy could lead the way to similar institutions opening in @entity27 ‘ i hope she will be forced to go in front of @entity46 and answer why she has rewritten the current law , ignored the will of mps and peers and put at risk the lives of many vulnerable people in our country			1
’ the assisted dying pressure group @entity214 , which backs @entity60 ’s bill , said the @entity5 ’s guideline was a ‘ small change ’ which would not make the law workable			0
dignity in dying chief @entity220 said : ‘ the change to the prosecuting policy makes clear that a healthcare professional who assists a patient to end their life in the context of an ongoing caring relationship is more likely to be prosecuted than a healthcare professional who assists outside of that context			2
‘ this seems to send a strange message to patients – effectively that they should not seek help from healthcare professionals who know them and their medical history , and who they as patients trust , but instead seek advice and assistance from healthcare professionals they do not know			0

prosecution rules relaxed for doctors who help patients commit suicide
charges should only be brought when doctors or carers ' exert influence '
the change in policy has been condemned by anti-euthanasia campaigners
there are fears it will lead to suicide hospitals being established in @entity27
