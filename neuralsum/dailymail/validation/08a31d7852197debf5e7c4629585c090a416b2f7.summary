he will bring with him @entity66 coach @entity65 , who was @entity67 's assistant at @entity68 in 2010			2
it is unlikely , however , that @entity1 will be considered as the permanent successor to @entity21 , who was sacked yesterday after 17 months at the @entity16			1
@entity71 understands that @entity68 manager @entity72 and @entity74 assistant @entity73 are at the top of the club 's shortlist to take charge beyond this season			1
@entity73 , in particular , fits the profile of coach who could work within the structure at the club , where sporting director @entity84 has control over transfers			2
