by @entity0 @entity1 watched @entity4 thump @entity2 on monday night knowing it was already too late to stop him losing his job as @entity7 manager next month			1
@entity4 chairman @entity8 held a meeting to make it clear he has chosen to go in a different direction at the end of the season after what he sees as a failed experiment with his highly - rated academy coach			1
@entity8 , who did not attend monday night ’s game , wants current @entity19 coach @entity18 to start work after this summer ’s @entity21 , having learned that the 62 - year - old can now negotiate a pre-contract			1
you ’d rather have a pre-season , bringing in your own players , but that was not the case for me so i ’ve just got on with it			0

my record is second to none here			0
’ @entity1 is likely to make a clean break from @entity7 after nearly six years with the club and try to get another chance as a manager			1
the former @entity4 midfielder was brought back by @entity64 , initially as a first - team coach , and then impressively guided the youngsters			1
but just one win in six matches before monday night , combined with @entity1 ’s outspoken comments criticising the character of his players , persuaded @entity8 to go for more experience			1
@entity73 was always his first choice , but has been waiting to decide his future while there were rumours that @entity78 might part with @entity79			2
the @entity80 accepts that will not happen now			0
waiting in the wings : @entity18 steps down as @entity19 coach after the @entity21 starting chance : @entity86 under 21 international @entity85 celebrates scoring @entity4 's third double trouble : @entity89 - rejuvenated under @entity1 - scored twice @entity8 has also kept tabs on @entity92 ’s @entity91 and @entity93 , who has just won the @entity80 title with @entity95			1
@entity96 was another option after a rocky spell at @entity99 but he is now closing in on a @entity101 semi-final			0
after scoring twice , striker @entity89 paid tribute to @entity1 , saying : ‘ no matter what happens to the manager , i respect him			2
‘ he has been a big part of my life			0
when everyone forgot me he brought me back and gave me my life back			0
’ this was a damaging result for @entity2 boss @entity111 , who said : ‘ i am the manager and i take responsibility			2
‘ sometimes the table does n’t lie			0
it would be a miracle to stay up			0
’ smiles better : @entity1 has just five games left in charge at @entity7			1
