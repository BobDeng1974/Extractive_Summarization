by @entity1 reporter it is the exercise increasingly favoured by those fed up with public transport and looking to take more exercise			0
but riding a bike dramatically increases the risk of injury to the genitals and kidneys , a study has shown			2
cycling , and in particular the bike itself , cause a worrying amount of kidney and genitalia injuries especially among children , researchers say			1
the study also found that 70 per cent of bike - related injuries to the kidneys and genitals were a result of direct contact with the bike , rather than falling off			1
on yer bike : cycling fans run a risk of injuring kidneys and genitals , with 4,000 people admitted to @entity32 every year in the @entity33 about 4,000 people visit @entity33 emergency rooms for bicycle - related kidney and genital injuries each year , 61 per cent of which were males			1
in a study published in the journal @entity43 , researchers analysed data collected by the @entity33 ’s @entity45 between 2002 and 2010			0
children were found to have sustained about ten times as many of these types of injuries as adults			1
still , adults ' injuries more often required hospital admission			2
about 12 per cent of the adult er visits in the study led to a hospital admission , compared to seven per cent of children 's visits			0
about 70 per cent of injuries resulted from direct contact with the bike , and in nearly half of those injuries , the culprit was the top tube that runs between the seat and the handlebars			1

they excluded injuries that had been caused by a collision with a car			2
despite these data , the authors called the paper ‘ exploratory , ’ emphasizing that it should n't necessarily lead to changes in safety precautions			0
‘ our data has n't informed prevention strategies yet , ’ said @entity69			0
although changes in a bicycle 's design could potentially prevent some injuries , ‘ you ca n't figure that out with this kind of study , ’ he said			2
some experts argued that biking holds inherent risks , and that making changes to bicycles in light of so few major injuries is n't necessary			0
‘ riding your bike safely is the most important thing			0
