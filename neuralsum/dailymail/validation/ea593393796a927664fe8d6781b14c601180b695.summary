she was one of the inaugural recipients on the now - highly regarded @entity136 which put a premium on travel and service			0
this is not the first time that @entity3 has been linked to @entity12 or to @entity131 , who was 16 when she was last seen in @entity75 , @entity74 , five months after @entity29 's disappearance			1

the @entity70 checked @entity3 out at the time but could not prove that he was connected to either woman			1
@entity7 is also skeptical even now that @entity3 , who was found not guilty of the 2001 murder of @entity80 , his neighbor in @entity191 , @entity192 , despite admitting that he chopped his body up and threw it in the sea , will be charged in connection with her sister 's disappearance			1

' the @entity70 looked at him a few years ago and came up with nothing			0

they dismiss the possibility that she might have staged her own disappearance			0
' we were a very close family — we still are a very close family , ' said @entity7			0
' and there are no signs that she wanted to disappear			0
she had n't packed her bags or withdrawn money or anything like that			0
' but still the family clings to the hope that she is still alive			0

' @entity67 of the @entity234 , a non-profit set up to help find missing adults , told @entity8 that the family is hoping that the @entity127 link may finally bring some closure to their 18 - year ordeal ' of course we live with that hope , ' said @entity7 , 38			2
' but it has been a very long time			0
' and as for the chance that she has been held captive for a dozen and a half years , she added : ' there is a part of each of us that hopes for something like that , but it is hard to imagine what the past 18 years would have been like for her if that were the case			0
' @entity29 's parents , @entity37 , an engineer and @entity31 , an elementary school teacher , have both now retired			1
last december they finally sold the five - bedroom , four - bath home in an upscale development south of @entity113 , that @entity29 and her three sisters had grown up in , and moved to @entity264			1
in a statement , issued through family friend @entity67 , @entity37 and @entity69 pointed out that the @entity70 had investigated @entity3 before			1

@entity67 , who runs the @entity234 , a non-profit set up to help find missing adults , told @entity8 that the family is just hoping that the @entity127 link may finally bring some closure to their 18 - year ordeal			0
' @entity3 is crazy and he has shown he is not willing to admit anything , ' she said			0
' i certainly want it to be him , ' @entity67 added			0
' then we would be able to find out at least something , but we have been disappointed so many times in the past			0
' but police in @entity61 , @entity74 say there is nothing new to link @entity3 to @entity12			1
' the @entity291 conducted an investigation with the assistance of the @entity70 regarding the 1997 disappearance of @entity12			1
the investigation was open and active for several years			0
at this time we do not have any evidence that indicates @entity3 was involved in her disappearance			2
