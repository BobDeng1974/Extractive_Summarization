@entity0 is confident he can reproduce his show - stopping form of last season for @entity3 as he approaches full fitness following hamstring troubles that have ruined his campaign so far			1
the midfielder delivered good news following the @entity10 ' disappointing 2 - 1 loss to @entity11 at the weekend - he 's feeling back to his best			1
and the timing could n't be more perfect ahead of the @entity10 ' @entity14 meeting with @entity15 on wednesday			1
@entity0 says he 's approaching full fitness after struggling with hamstring problems this season @entity0 skips away from @entity11 's @entity17 in their disappointing loss on saturday ' i had a hamstring injury and it takes a few games to get back to your best , ' he told @entity3			1
' in the last game it was the first time in a long time that i felt sharp again and felt like i was physically there			0
hopefully i can continue that and have a very successful season			0
@entity0 , 23 , scored three goals in the @entity10 ' opening four matches before being struck down again by injury and admits he 's been too eager to impress with goals on his return			1
' maybe at the beginning , yes [ i was trying too hard to score ] , ' @entity0 said			2
' now i 've put that to the back of my mind and i 'm focusing on other things			2
that will come naturally again			0
@entity0 ( left , marking @entity40 at training on tuesday ) says he is close to his top form the @entity10 train under grey skies at @entity44 on tuesday ahead of hosting @entity15 ' i still believe in my qualities , and i 'm confident that i can show them again this year			1
there will be plenty more opportunities			0
' in saying that , the @entity50 star is n't going to stop his surges forward that cause so many problems for opposing defenders			2
' i 'm still going to make my runs into the box			0
i also can get back and defend , and that 's what i mean by saying that 's the best i 've felt [ in a while against @entity11 ]			2
when i got forward , i could get back in time as well			0
' @entity62 ( right ) has come to @entity3 's rescue with goals in the absence of @entity0 and @entity66 @entity0 is substituted for @entity66 ( right ) , who scored a cracker on his return , during their 2 - 1 loss to @entity11 after their second 2 - 1 defeat in a row , @entity0 admits @entity75 's camp is disappointed , especially at missing out on the rewards for what they thought was an improved performance			1
but they 're looking forward rather than back with @entity15 en route to the @entity81			1
' it was very frustrating afterwards because we felt like we played a good game and had plenty of opportunities to score , ' he said of the @entity11 loss			0
' on another day they may have gone in , but i think it is important not to get too down about that			0
' we played well and we have to continue to play in the way we believe we should			0
we are looking forward to the game against @entity15 now			2
