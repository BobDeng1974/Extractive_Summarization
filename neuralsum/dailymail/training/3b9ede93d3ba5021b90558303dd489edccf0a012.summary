by @entity1 reporter published : 08:16 est , 19 april 2012 updated : 19:22 est , 19 april 2012 footage of @entity4 's brutal dictator and his wife packing up food parcels has been broadcast on state tv - after they were derided for ordering luxury goods on the internet while their country burns			1
pictures were broadcast last night showing @entity13 and @entity14 receiving a rapturous welcome at @entity17 stadium in @entity18			0
they joined hundreds of volunteers boxing cartons full of flour , sugar , cooking oil and pasta for victims of fighting in @entity27 , where the president 's forces are crushing an uprising			0
those images are now part of a @entity57 campaign led by the wives of @entity60 ambassadors from @entity61 and @entity62 , which alternates stylish shots of @entity14 with gruesome pictures of dead and injured @entity4 children			1
for her latest tv appearance @entity14 avoided any hint of glamour , dressing down in a sheer pink sweater over a simple dress with her dark blonde hair soberly braided and pinned up			0
her tall , gangly husband looked relaxed , towering above his admirers in a polo shirt with an identity pass on a ribbon around his neck like other volunteers			0
dressing down : for her latest tv appearance @entity14 avoided any hint of glamour , dressing down in a sheer pink sweater over a simple dress with her dark blonde hair soberly braided and pinned up workers : the two packed boxes , sealed them with @entity87 tape and carried them over to stacks of aid awaiting distribution the two packed boxes , sealed them with scotch tape and carried them over to stacks of aid awaiting distribution			0
emergence of the footage came as @entity4 was slammed by the @entity60 for failing to keep to the terms of a peace plan and continuing to station troops and heavy weapons in towns			1
in a letter to the @entity106 @entity60 chief @entity104 said @entity4 was failing to send a ' clear signal ' about its commitment to peace , underlining @entity111 fears for the week - old truce			1
despite these fears , the @entity60 today signed an agreement on the terms of a future ceasefire monitoring mission , the @entity4 @entity113 said			1
it could see up to 300 observers entering the country			1
@entity121 mediator @entity120 said the @entity4 government and the @entity60 had agreed a basis for a ' protocol ' on the deployment of more monitors			1
chaos : gunfire and protests broke out near a team of @entity60 observers yesterday , in a town close to @entity18 fear : shooting erupted close to an advance party of military personnel from the @entity60 who had been swarmed by protesters denouncing @entity138 in the town of @entity140 ' this agreement outlines the functions of the observers as they fulfil their mandate in @entity4 and the tasks and responsibilities of the @entity4 government , ' @entity141 , @entity120 's spokesman , said in a statement			1
@entity141 said @entity120 's team was holding ' similar discussions with representatives of the opposition on the tasks and responsibilities of the armed opposition groups			0
' a survey by the @entity60 has found that the number of civilians uprooted inside @entity4 has jumped by some 230,000 since the start of the uprising last year			1
a report by the @entity163 and the @entity165 - based @entity164 says more than 600,000 people are now internally displaced inside @entity4 , including some 400,000 from the country 's 1967 war with @entity169			1
tens of thousands more have fled to neighbouring countries , making them officially refugees			0
the increase makes @entity4 the country with the eighth highest number of internally displaced people in the world			1
@entity178 has the highest number of these refugees , with up to 5.2 million displaced , followed by @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183			0
the 15 - member @entity106 will meet at 1pm gmt today for a briefing by @entity120 's deputy , @entity185			0
it is seen as crucial in determining whether the conditions are right for deploying a larger monitoring mission to @entity4			1
@entity190 and @entity191 diplomats on the council have suggested that @entity4 's lack of full compliance with its obligations to end the violence may make it difficult for them to support a new resolution that would be needed to deploy an expanded observer mission			2
in the first progress report since the @entity106 passed a resolution on saturday authorising the deployment of observers			0
secretary - general @entity104 proposed an expanded mission of 300 personnel to monitor a shaky ceasefire between forces loyal to president @entity138 and opposition fighters			2
@entity104 said this week that 250 observers were too few in a country of 23million where the @entity60 says at least 9,000 people have been killed in the past 13 months			1
he sought @entity191 help in supplying planes and helicopters			0
but @entity4 foreign minister @entity215 said 250 was a ' reasonable number '			2
but he added that they should be from countries such as @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 - all more sympathetic to @entity18 than are the @entity224 or the @entity225			0
he also dismissed any need for @entity60 aircraft			2
violation : smoke and fire billows from a building as shells rain down in the flashpoint city of @entity27 chaos : @entity4 soldier manning a checkpoing the monitors ' mission , however , will be a perilous one			2
yesterday gunfire and protests broke out near a team of @entity60 observers			2
shooting erupted close to an advance party of military personnel from the @entity60 who had been swarmed by protesters denouncing @entity138 in the town of @entity140 , on the northeastern outskirts of the capital @entity18			0
there were no reports of casualties			0
but scenes of monitors ' vehicles stuck in a crowd and men running away while gunfire rattled in the air were an ominous echo of an earlier monitoring mission , by the @entity225 , which collapsed in january			1
the @entity190 said the incident - and sustained shelling by the @entity4 army of the city of @entity27 - raised questions about whether observers could actually monitor any truce .			2

@entity60 slams @entity4 for failing remove troops and heavy weapons from towns
despite that , agreement signed on terms of ceasefire monitoring mission
