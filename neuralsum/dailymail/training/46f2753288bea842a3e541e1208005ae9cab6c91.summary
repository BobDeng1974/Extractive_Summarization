published : 10:13 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 16:04 est , 4 june 2013 jubilant : @entity1 , a college student took the crown in @entity3 today after months of preparation there can only be one winner and today a 21 - year - old student beat 54 other participants to win @entity9			1
@entity1 , a college student took the crown in @entity3 today			1
she will now go on to represent @entity11 for this year 's @entity13 beauty pageant			1
the 20 finalists already hit the headlines this year when their photos were posted on @entity18 fuelling speculation that many of them had undergone surgery and prompting users to criticise the @entity25 nation 's growing trend to go under the knife			1
@entity11 currently have more plastic surgery than in any other country according to recent figures , with the craze particularly popular among 19 to 49 - year - olds			1
the popularity of surgery , particularly among the young , has been blamed by some on a desire to look more ' western ' fuelled by an obsession with celebrity culture			1
all of the women vying for the crown of @entity9 2013 have dark , perfectly trussed hair , either tumbling over their shoulders or neatly tied up , pale skin , bright eyes and a perfect bright white smile			1
and their apparent similarity prompted @entity18 user @entity46 to post their pictures online , suggesting that many of those vying for the @entity9 title this year have had similar surgery			2
he captioned the image : ' @entity11 â€™s plastic surgery mayhem is finally converging on the same face			2
' the post saw more than 3,000 people comment in response , debating the merits of widespread plastic surgery			2
scrolll down for video hopefuls : @entity11 contestants pose during the 2013 @entity9 beauty contest in @entity3 strike a pose : @entity11 contestants perform during the 2013 @entity9 beauty contest in @entity3 today @entity18 user @entity68 , who claims to hail from @entity3 , said : : ' those women in fact do look unnervingly similar and yes , @entity71 think so too			1
' this is called the @entity11 plastic face look			2
in certain areas of @entity3 , you would think all the women are sisters because they look so similar due to same surgeries			1
' without the plastic surgery , korean women are very diverse looking and easily can be told apart			2
' the surgery takes away their individuality and uniqueness and its sad			2
most are beautiful without it but telling them that their @entity11 ethnic features are in fact lovely is as effective as screaming at a brick wall			2
' they wont believe you because they 've been brainwashed to think westernization of their features is superior , i do n't think they want to look white , but a mix of white and @entity25 and definitely less @entity11			0
' another @entity18 user , @entity98 , added : ' i live in @entity11 and older women complain how girls do n't look @entity11 anymore because of all the plastic surgery			0
' it 's so common to the point if i meet a girl , i just assume she has had something done			0
' girls here consider eye surgery just like using make up			0

@entity117 will represent @entity11 for this year 's @entity13 beauty pageant victorious : after winning first place @entity120 was given a tiara , sash and flowers but others on the social networking site said that all the pictures served to prove was that there is a ' cultural divide ' between the east and west in terms of plastic surgery			1
@entity134 commented : ' @entity136 women want to exaggerate their features with plastic surgeries ( fuller lips , bigger boobs , bigger butts ) while @entity25 women want to refine their features ( smaller chins etc ) so there is definitely a cultural divide when it comes to plastic surgery			0
' the pageant sparked controversy last year when pictures emerged of winner @entity152 before she had undergone plastic surgery , with many claiming that cosmetic procedures give contestants an unfair advantage			0
the student revealed her plastic surgery secret after photos emerged of her looking very different at school , but she said she had n't misled anyone			1
but she defended her crown telling the @entity11 media : ' i never said i was born beautiful			1
' @entity11 have more plastic surgery than any other nation according to figures released in january			0
congratulations : @entity120 is congratulated by contestants during the contest those in the @entity25 country have more treatments per members of the population , with one in every 77 turning to the knife or needle			0
the figures , from the @entity179 ( @entity179 ) , show that in 2011 , 15 million people across the globe turned to plastic surgery to enhance their looks			0
while the popularity of cosmetic surgery in @entity11 may come as a surprise to many , the industry there is in fact booming			0
last year , 20 per cent of women aged 19 to 49 in the capital city of @entity3 admitted to going under the knife			1
one of the most popular surgical procedures is double eyelid surgery - which reduces excess skin in the upper eyelid to make the eyes appear bigger and make them look more ' western '			0
it is believed that the rise of the country 's music industry is behind the boom , and many patients visit clinics with photos of celebrities , asking surgeons to emulate @entity209 noses or eyes			0
singer @entity211 , whose song ' @entity214 ' became a global hit , said his record label had urged him to get plastic surgery			0
