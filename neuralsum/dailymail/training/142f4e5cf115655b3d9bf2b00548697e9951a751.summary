@entity0 has been a rock in @entity3 's shaky defence during a difficult first five months for @entity5 's new - look side , says former @entity7 legend @entity6			1
@entity0 , who signed from @entity8 for £ 18.9million in 2011 , had a difficult start to life with @entity3 with many criticising the @entity12 for some shaky early displays between the posts			1
@entity0 , however , has excelled for @entity3 in recent seasons and has been consistently excellent behind a questionable defence hit by injuries to key players such as @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 and without the experienced trio of @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 who all moved on during the summer			1
@entity0 has been superb for @entity5 's new look @entity27 side this season @entity0 saves a shot from @entity30 's @entity29 during his side 's recent 2 - 1 victory at @entity33 's @entity0 denies @entity35 forward @entity34 a shot at goal during @entity3 's win at the @entity39 @entity40 ( left ) congratulates @entity0 after his superb performance against @entity42 in october and @entity6 , who played eight seasons for @entity3 , believes @entity0 has proven himself to be @entity45 's most reliable player during the current campaign			1

i think he 's the only player in the squad who performs consistently every time			0
last season he was the only player who consistently brought any kind of quality to @entity3			2
' last season was good for him			0
he won the championship in the year before but there was still this doubt about him and i think he washed that away with his performances			0
' after a disastrous start to the season , including a 5 - 3 humiliation at @entity64 in september , @entity45 's has steadied the ship in recent weeks with @entity3 winning their last five @entity67 games on the trot			1
@entity70 's @entity69 shoots past @entity0 ( left ) during his time with @entity72 back in 2010 recent wins over @entity74 , @entity35 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity30 have propelled @entity3 up to third in the table			1
' that 's how you win championships			0
that 's how you qualify for the @entity83 , ' the @entity81 added			0
' last season , as soon as they came under pressure and went behind , they would lose the game which is very unlike @entity3			2
' to get results and play the way they played against @entity30 and win that game , it was hugely important			0
' at no point in that game were they impressive but that was the kind of game they would lose last season so that 's a very big positive			2
