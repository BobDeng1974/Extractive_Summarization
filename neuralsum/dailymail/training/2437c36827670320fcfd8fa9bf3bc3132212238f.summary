by @entity0 the famous slogan of the @entity2 is ' how do you eat yours ? ' but have you ever wondered how exactly they are made ? the chocolate treats sell millions every year in the run up to @entity9 and now for the first time , the secret of how the famous egg is created can be revealed			1
the factory in @entity12 , @entity13 , makes around 1.5 million of the sweets every day in an operation that @entity16 could only dream of			2
amazingly , the process is not as simple as pressing two bits of egg shaped chocolate together and injecting the creamy goodness inside			2
@entity2 executive @entity31 explained : ' the process of making the creme egg was a @entity35 moment and is not done in the way that most @entity9 eggs are formed			1
' instead the entire egg and the creamy interior are fused together while they are still in liquid form			1
mr @entity31 said : ' a blob of liquid milk chocolate goes into a half egg shape mould where it is levelled			1
melted magic : the entire egg and the creamy interior are fused together while they are still in liquid form @entity2 executive mr @entity31 explained : ' a blob of liquid milk chocolate goes into a half egg shape mould where it is levelled ' fusion : straight away a blob of white fondant goes on top of the still - melted chocolate and the orange fondant is then added cool down : once the fusing process is complete , cool air is blown onto the eggs for 40 minutes to set them ' straight away a blob of white fondant goes on top of the still - melted chocolate			1
the two liquids do n’t mix because the fondant is of a higher density			0
' the orange fondant , of even higher density , is then added			0
the other half of the egg , which is chocolate and white fondant is then put on top			2
' because the whole egg is still liquid the chocolate surrounds the filling and completes the egg shape			2
' once the fusing process is complete , cool air is blown onto the eggs for 40 minutes and once solidified , a hammer is gently tapped on the mould and the completed eggs drop down onto a ramp			0
' a robot sucks the eggs off the ramp placing them onto trays then another machine mechanically wraps each egg in foil			0
' nearly ready ! once solidified , a hammer is gently tapped on the mould and the completed eggs drop down onto a ramp ready for the wrapping stage wrap it up : a robot sucks the eggs off the ramp placing them onto trays then another machine mechanically wraps each egg in foil hundreds are wrapped each minute at the nut - free factory , which operates 364 days of the year			0
the premises were built just for @entity105 in 1986			0
they are the @entity108 ’s top selling confectionery item between @entity109 and @entity9 , a period known as the ‘ @entity2 season ’			1
around half of the factory output is sold abroad , mostly to the @entity112 and @entity113 where they are sold under license by @entity116 works like clockwork : hundreds of the chocolatey eggs are wrapped each minute at the nut - free factory , which operates 364 days of the year and they 're off ! the eggs are the top selling confectionery item between @entity109 and @entity9 incoming ! the chocolate treats sell millions every year in the run up to @entity9 and now for the first time , the secret of how the famous egg is created can be revealed from start to finish quality checks : @entity2 now claims 85 per cent of the filled egg market in the @entity108 the eggs are manufactured as a slightly smaller shape for the @entity112 market and the colour green is added to the egg ’s red , blue and yellow classic foil wrap			1
filled eggs were first made by the @entity2 brothers in 1923 , but the @entity2 in its current form was created in 1971			0
@entity2 now claims 85 per cent of the filled egg market in the @entity108			2
the company that began as a grocer ’s shop selling cocoa in 1824 uses one million litres of @entity146 and @entity147 milk and 60,000 tonnes of @entity149 cocoa to produce three billion chocolate items every year , including the @entity105			1
variations : the eggs are manufactured as a slightly smaller shape for the @entity112 market that 's a lot of chocolate ! the company one million litres of @entity146 and @entity147 milk and 60,000 tonnes of @entity149 cocoa to produce three billion chocolate items every year small but perfectly formed : filled eggs were first made by the @entity2 brothers in 1923 , but the @entity2 in its current form was created in 1971 ready to go : a staggering 1.5m of the chocolate eggs are made every day in the run up to @entity9 history : the company began as a grocer 's shop selling cocoa in 1824 on their way to a store near you : the eggs are the best - selling @entity2 product in the run up to @entity9 yum ! these fascinating pictures reveal the complex and high - tech process that goes into making the eggs confectionery giants : @entity2 now claims 85 per cent of the filled egg market in the @entity108 before and after : the melted chocolate falls into egg shaped moulds before being cooled down and set secrets revealed : the white and yellow fondants remain separate because they 're different densities creme eggs were first manufactured back in 1923 by the @entity185 the @entity2 of today is different to the original and was n't introduced until 1963 the egg was originally called a @entity187 's @entity2 ( because of the @entity187 's brand ) , and was then re-branded as the @entity2 in 1971 the foil that the egg is wrapped in was originally green , red , yellow and blue in the @entity108 and @entity193 the colour green was removed and purple replaced blue in the 21st century there have so far been 25 versions such as the @entity199 ( @entity200 ) , @entity201 , @entity2 ice cream , @entity203 , @entity204 ( @entity205 ) , @entity206 ( for @entity208 ) , @entity207 , and @entity209 in 1955 one of the first fully automatic chocolate egg machines was installed at @entity211			1
this meant that for the first time mould heating , depositing of the liquid chocolate , rotation of the moulds to achieve uniform thickness , cooling and de-moulding of the two halves of the egg took place in a series of mechanical operations			0
over the years this process has been refined , production speeds have been greatly increased and machinery has become computer controlled			0
the latest @entity2 plant at @entity211 is a sophisticated computer controlled operation capable of producing up to 1.5 million eggs each day how do you eat yours ? @entity2 introduced the classic @entity2 advertising slogan ‘ how do you eat yours ? ’ in 1985 - so what was the most popular answer ? - bite off the top , lick out the creme then eat the chocolate ( 53 per cent ) - bite straight through ( 20 per cent ) - use your finger to scoop out the creme ( 16 per cent )			0
