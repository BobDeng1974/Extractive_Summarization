scroll down for the video naked ambition : members of @entity26 take to the pitch in their pants in a desperate bid to attract a sponsor to buy them a new kit what a catch : the lads have produced a whacky video of them in action to the @entity34 's hit @entity35 in the three - minute film , the @entity37 side hit the turf in just their underwear , shin pads and boots to the tune of @entity34 's hit @entity35			1
within days of the clip appearing on @entity47 , more than 500 people have viewed it			1

club captain @entity54 , 27 , said : ' it not always easy to find sponsorship these days so we wanted to do something that would make us stand out			0
' our relegation last year certainly was n't going to do that so we came up with the idea of a @entity62 was good fun to make , if slightly odd , and hopefully people will enjoy watching it			0
' have it ! the boys leave the ' changing room ' in just their underwear , boots and shin pads to face the opposition getting the tackle in : the club , which competes in the @entity19 , was getting tired of opponents laughing at their tatty old kit the loin toss : the team , which includes a delivery driver , a groundsman , it expert and insurance workers , was relegated by two divisions after a dismal 2010/11 season that saw them concede more than 100 goals winger @entity87 , 30 , who features performing an elaborate stretching routine , said : ' new players might think twice about joining us if they see this video			1
' but we 're not particularly bothered about that at the moment			0
we just want to do everything we can to get some kit			0
' i do n't particularly fancy playing in next to nothing in november and december			2
' the team , which includes a delivery driver , students , a groundsman , it expert and insurance workers , was relegated by two divisions after a dismal 2010/11 season that saw them concede more than 100 goals			0

' @entity17 fan @entity136 , 28 , who occasionally brings dog @entity137 to watch husband and star striker @entity139 , 35 , said : ' the video did make laugh			0
' they do n't look particularly pretty but hopefully it will work			0
