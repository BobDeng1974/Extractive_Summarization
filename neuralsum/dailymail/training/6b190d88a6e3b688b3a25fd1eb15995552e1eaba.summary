broadcasters last night threatened to go ahead with televised election debates with or without @entity2			1
the ‘ take it or leave it ’ offer by @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 came as bosses published revised plans that will now involve the leaders of seven parties			1
along with the @entity16 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , tv executives have extended the invitation to the @entity18 , the @entity19 and @entity21 nationalists @entity22			0
her inclusion will now put pressure on @entity45 to agree to the debates – even though ongoing unrest among other smaller and regional parties threatens to scupper the screenings altogether			2
broadcasters last night said they had made the changes after reviewing the ‘ electoral landscape ’ but issued a clear warning that they would ‘ empty chair ’ any leader who refused to turn up			0
the @entity16 pushed for the debates to happen in 2010 , when mr @entity27 was seen to have have triumphed over mr @entity2 and @entity58 a spokesman for the tv companies said : ‘ the party leaders will be formally invited to take part in these debates			1
in the event that any of the invited party leaders decline to participate , debates will take place with the party leaders who accept the invitation			0
’ the schedule will now feature two debates involving all seven leaders – one on @entity4 and one on @entity5			1
@entity75 candidates : @entity2 and @entity28 host : @entity78 @entity4 candidates : @entity2 , @entity28 , @entity27 host : @entity81 @entity5 candidates : @entity2 , @entity28 , @entity27 , @entity30 host : @entity84 @entity75 candidates : @entity2 and @entity28 host : @entity78 @entity4 candidates : @entity2 , @entity28 , @entity27 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 host : @entity81 @entity5 candidates : @entity2 , @entity28 , @entity27 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 host : @entity84 a third , on @entity7 and @entity6 , will be a head - to - head clash between mr @entity2 and @entity28 only			1
the @entity16 last night said the proposals were ‘ being considered as part of the on - going discussions about the debates ’			2
the new format appears less favourable to mr @entity28 , however , who will have to face several other parties that are directly challenging him for votes and seats			2
@entity13 immediately insisted he would debate ‘ anyone the broadcasters choose to invite ’ , claiming it was ‘ surely now not possible ’ for mr @entity2 to oppose participation in the debates			1
the @entity14 , who find themselves reduced to minor party status within the new television format , strongly opposed the latest plans			0
they insisted that @entity27 – who triumphed in the debates before the last election in 2010 – deserved to feature in all the screenings because the @entity14 are in government and want to ‘ defend their record ’			2
@entity15 leader @entity30 also opposed the inclusion of other minor parties			1
he told @entity119 : ‘ what is the point of having the four major parties as defined by @entity123 and then @entity124 and all ? ‘ you ca n’t have a debate with seven people on the podium			0
' and if you ’re going to have seven , you ’ve got to have the @entity130 @entity129 ( @entity129 )			2
' they , after all , are the fourth biggest party in @entity132			0
’ the @entity129 ’s leader , @entity130 first minister @entity133 , wrote to the broadcasters yesterday describing the new format as ‘ unacceptable ’			2
he said : ‘ in light of the extension of the debates to smaller and regional parties , the failure of the broadcasters to invite the @entity129 to participate is inexplicable			1
‘ the broadcasters ’ decision can not logically or legally be defended			0
’ @entity130 's @entity129 ( @entity129 ) leader @entity133 said he would be writing to the @entity4 and @entity5 demanding an explanation for the exclusion in a further potential hurdle , @entity145 – whose elected mps do not even attend @entity132 – said it would challenge any attempt to exclude it from the debates			1
a party spokesman said : ‘ @entity145 will take every opportunity to present and promote its policies and positions			0
’ @entity155 , the @entity156 ’s sole mp , has also demanded his inclusion			0
the original proposal was for one debate featuring the @entity34 and @entity28 , a second including mr @entity27 and a third with the addition of @entity15 leader @entity30			1
the row over the exclusion of the @entity164 has sparked an apparent surge in support for the party , which saw it pick up several points in the polls and thousands of new members			0
leader miss @entity31 described the decision to include her party as ‘ groundbreaking ’ and the apparent surge in support as a ‘ @entity176 ’			0
the group of major broadcasters said that since the initial proposal they had monitored ‘ the electoral landscape ’ and taken into account polling data and ‘ expressions of public support for the debates to go ahead and for a wider range of parties to be included in the debates ’			1
the proposed dates for the debates are april 2 , 16 and 30 – with the final clash exactly a week ahead of the @entity193 poll on may 7 .			0

broadcasters agree to @entity2 's demand for a role for the @entity164
new plan would see one tv battle between @entity2 and @entity28
@entity4 and @entity5 would then host separate debates with seven - strong line - up
tv chiefs say debates will go ahead with or without @entity2 and @entity27
but minor parties are *furious* over snub - including @entity210 and the @entity129
