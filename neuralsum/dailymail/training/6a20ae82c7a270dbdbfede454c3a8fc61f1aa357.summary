while people like to think they will stick to their ethical principles no matter what , when they feel financially deprived , they are more likely to relax their moral standards and commit minor transgressions , scientists claim			1
@entity18 researchers found that faced with financial losses suffered as a result of the last recession , some people resorted to workplace sabotage and stole supplies and equipment			2
scientists from the @entity28 's @entity27 , said people are more likely to judge other deprived moral offenders who do the same more leniently			1
@entity30 , an associate professor of marketing at the university and one of the lead researchers of the study , said : ' we found that most respondents did not think financial deprivation would lead them to behave immorally			2
' yet , once they actually experienced financial deprivation , they were more likely to loosen their ethical principles			0
' the study , to be published in the journal @entity43 and @entity44 , found public policies that entrench financial inequalities , such as regressive taxation plans or tax cuts for the wealthy , could also lead to more cheating inside and outside the office			0
last resort : @entity18 researchers found that faced with financial losses suffered as a result of the last recession , some people resorted to workplace sabotage and stole supplies and equipment and those who interpret or enforce policies or regulations as part of their work - in corporations , law enforcement , or the judicial system - need to be mindful of the deprivation effect too , the study said			2
temporary upsets in a person 's own financial position could lead them to go easier on others demonstrating unethical behaviour while under financial stress , according to the paper			0
there are many ways people assess their financial health , but research has found one of the strongest influences is comparing oneself to other people			0
a sense of financial deprivation can happen when people simply feel financially inferior to their peers			1
the findings are based on a series of experiments that studied people 's views about dishonest behaviour and how they behaved once they were induced to feel financially - deprived themselves			1
workplace theft is common : employees may see their own and other colleagues ' financial positions as inferior and unfair , relative to the companies and executives they work for , leading to workplace stealing the effects were observed both in experiments where people actually experienced financial loss and in those where they were merely made to feel financially - deprived , relative to others			1
the effects were lessened however , when people saw that acting unethically would be unfair , would not improve their financial situation , or when they accepted that their financial position was deserved			0
perceptions of fairness were key to participants ' decisions to act honestly or dishonestly , said professor @entity30			0
the research suggests that one reason why workplace theft is so common , is because employees may see their own , and other colleagues ' financial positions as inferior and unfair , relative to the companies and executives they work for .			1

scientists from the @entity28 said that when people feel financially deprived , they are more likely to relax their moral standards
this is despite the fact that people predicted that financial *hardship* would not lead them to act immorally
the research suggests employees may see their own financial positions as unfair , relative to the companies they work for , leading to workplace thievery
