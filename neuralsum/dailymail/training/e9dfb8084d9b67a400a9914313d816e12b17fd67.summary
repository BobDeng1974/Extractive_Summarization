a pattern of the medal ’s shape is on the ‘ ball deadening ’ rubber grips on both the home white and red change strips			2
it alleged that both the shirt manufacturers @entity31 and the @entity32 had a last minute change of heart over the appropriateness			0
some fears that it was crass to associate bravery in the rugby world with the @entity7 that is awarded for ‘ most conspicuous bravery , or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self - sacrifice ’			1
@entity2 head coach @entity43 has drawn heavily on @entity2 ’s rich rugby history and used previous military examples to inspire players			1
the former @entity48 boss created the @entity49 , where @entity2 coaches select a winner after every match for the player producing the best defensive performance			2
@entity55 is @entity2 ’s only rugby international to be awarded the @entity7 , bestowed posthumously after he lost his life in the @entity60 @entity59 raid of april 1918 in the @entity61			1
it is the latest embarrassment for the @entity32 , which was forced to defend its new kit after admitting it will be changed in 10 months in time for the sport ’s world cup			0
@entity67 wearing the new @entity2 home kit , a uniform now mired in controversy the latest replica shirts , which cost £ 91 , will be used by the national team in the forthcoming @entity74 internationals and next year ’s @entity76 tournament			2

the manufacturers brought out three other @entity98 official jerseys at £ 56 each that are also replicas , but not made to the same standards as the @entity102 strips the players wear			0
the new shirt ’s design has not changed much from the previous one launched last september , apart from moving the @entity107 badge from the left to the centre			0
suppliers @entity31 claim the test jersey costs more because it is made from more flexible polyester and elastane fibres , has increased strength around the arms to prevent ripping and a small loop collar			0
