a @entity1 birdwatcher enjoying a sunshine holiday in @entity3 thought he was experiencing a case of deja vu when he captured a tiny bird			1
when @entity7 examined the identification ring on the leg of the blackcap he thought it bore an uncanny similarity to the one he had ringed weeks earlier			2
but that was 1,500 miles away close to his home @entity14 and the chances of capturing the same bird twice are almost incalculable			1
when @entity7 examined the identification ring on the bird ( pictured ) he thought it bore an uncanny similarity to the one he had ringed weeks earlier - 1,500 miles away close to his home in @entity14 but after a quick phone call to his wife back home , who checked in his ringing book , he found he had pulled off the most amazing fluke			1
the coincidence was the talk of the twitching world yesterday with enthusiasts wondering whether a case like it had ever been recorded before			0
last night mr @entity7 , 57 , was unavailable for comment as the keen ornithologist was out birdwatching and ringing again with twitchers			1
but @entity36 , 63 , a fellow ' ringer ' from the @entity39 , said he had been completely bowled over by the freak coincidence			0
he said the group had travelled to @entity42 in @entity3 to join an international team catching migrating birds to check them for leg tags to see where they had flown from in @entity47 while making their way to @entity49 where they usually spend the winter			1
mr @entity36 said ‘ i extracted a male blackcap from one of our standard mist nets and was very pleased , although not too surprised , to find that it was carrying a @entity58 ring			0
' back at the processing station , i read out the bird 's ring number several times for accuracy			0
’ he said : ‘ @entity7 went quiet , then he quickly got on the phone to his wife , who checked in his ringing book back home in @entity14			2
mr @entity7 had travelled with a group to @entity42 in @entity3 ( pictured ) to join a team catching migrating birds to check them for leg tags to see where they had flown from in @entity47 while making their way to @entity49 ‘ and hey @entity75 - the bird was indeed one of two blackcaps he had ringed at @entity78 , on the north shore of the @entity80 in @entity14 , on september 11 2014 , a few weeks before we had left for @entity3			1
’ he said the rare coincidence was one of those once - in - a - lifetime occurrences and it left fellow birdwatchers completely stunned			0
‘ unfortunately @entity7 was n't able to buy a lottery ticket on that day , but it must be a given that he was pretty certain of a big win with that kind of luck , ’ he added			0
a distinctive greyish warbler the size of a sparrow , the male has a black cap and the female has a chestnut one and its distinctive fluting song has earned it the name ' northern nightingale '			0
according to experts , it is primarily a summer visitor to the @entity1 , but birds from @entity106 and north - east @entity47 are increasingly spending the winter in the @entity1			2
an estimated half a billion birds , from huge eagles to tiny warblers , migrate from @entity47 and @entity112 to @entity49 in the autumn and fly back in the spring .			2

@entity7 had tagged the small bird near his @entity14 home
weeks later on holiday 1,500 miles away in @entity3 he captured same bird
mr @entity7 was part of a group catching migrating birds to check tags to see where they had flown from in @entity47 while making their way to @entity49
chances of catching the same bird twice are almost incalculable
