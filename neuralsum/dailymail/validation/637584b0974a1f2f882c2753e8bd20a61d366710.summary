after discussing the situation with the school district , it was decided that @entity8 should adopt her new identity immediately			2
@entity8 considered her gender very much a personal matter and so the decision was taken to notify only students in her class and their parents , rather than making a blanket announcement to everyone			1
' we decided as a district , as a faculty , that it would do more harm than good to do a mass notification , ' @entity8 told @entity48			0
' instead do individual notifications in classrooms where they knew what to expect			0
' the district 's handling of the matter and @entity8 sudden change have come in for criticism from some parents who say they support the teacher but feel they should have been notified so they could speak to their kids about it			1
the @entity13 have updated information of their website about @entity8 after the decision was taken that she would transition to a woman sooner than originally planned ' on a friday he was a man , on monday he was woman , ' said one parent			1
' this probably brought or is going to bring disruption in the classroom because all these questions need to be answered , ' said another , who identified himself as @entity75			0
' they 're going to want to know why did the teacher did what he did			0
' students interviewed seem less concerned			0
' if it 's what she wants to do , i mean , i 'm not going to judge			0
it 's what she wants to make her happy , ' said a pupil called @entity88			0
a spokesperson for the @entity13 said they ca n't comment because it 's a personal and private matter for the teacher			1
@entity8 has asked parents to not be angry with the school district			2
' i 've got nothing but overwhelming support from the school district , ' she said			0
the teacher also told @entity48 that she has no regrets and now wants to focus on doing her best job in the classroom			0
' it 's just relaxing to be able to wake up in the morning and just be me , ' she said			2
@entity8 , pictured above , had originally planned on returning to school as a woman after the summer holidays , but that timetable had to be brought forward after she was outed by pupils over the weekend while on a date			1
