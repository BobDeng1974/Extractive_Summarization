down @entity2 way they say the azaleas are in full bloom , which is more than can be said for @entity6 ’s @entity5			1
a bruising @entity8 swing last month saw the @entity6 fall outside the world ’s top 10			1
for a player who has been virtually a fixture in the top five for the last three years it was certainly a dent to the ego , with the masters now just around the corner			1
@entity19 ’s solution to his miserable form — three missed cuts and a 55th - place finish at the @entity24 in four @entity25 starts — was the time - honoured one			1
for the past two weeks , the 34 - year - old has spent long hours on the practice ground			1
@entity5 hit 17 out of 18 greens in regulation and signed for a 69 at the @entity31 in the first round of the @entity31 on thursday there were encouraging signs his decline will prove temporary			1
@entity19 hit 17 out of 18 greens in regulation and signed for a 69 , the same score as his playing partner , the ever - consistent @entity37			1
‘ it ’s certainly a welcome return to the sixties , for it had been a while , ’ said @entity19 , smiling			2
on a day when @entity47 @entity46 went round in 63 and @entity48 enjoyed his best round in months with a 66 , it was hardly surprising the only reporter waiting to talk to @entity19 was this one			1
but under the radar is never a bad place to be going to the masters			2
the boom and bust years that characterised the first half of @entity19 ’s career meant there was never going to be any feelings of panic following his unusually poor run in the @entity8			1
‘ there ’s no doubt i lost my game there but the @entity8 swing can be unforgiving if you ’re slightly off , ’ he said			1
‘ over the past two weeks i feel like i ’ve done some good work and whether i finish well or not here i feel like i ’m going in the right direction again			2
‘ basically i was getting ahead of the ball at impact , and shots were going left or right , the irons were not solid and the new putter was not working			2
so we ’ve corrected the faults and i ’ve gone back to the old putter			2
’ @entity48 enjoyed his best round in months with a 66 on thursday does he pay much attention to the world rankings ? ‘ you notice , for sure , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’m very proud of the fact i ’ve been in the world ’s top five for practically the whole of the last three years			2
it ’s a nice ego thing , so by the end of the year i ’m hoping there wo n’t be any slippage			2
‘ but right now , i ’ve got to focus on my game in the knowledge that the rankings change fast when you ’re playing well			0
i ’m in all the tournaments i want to be in , so there ’s no need to worry on that score			0
typically , your good years are built around four or five really good weeks , so you have to stay patient			0
’ he ’d certainly love for one of those good weeks to be the next one			0
@entity19 paid a reconnaissance visit to @entity2 last monday and felt the same old thrill			0
‘ it ’s such a treat to enjoy it when it is quiet , you still pinch yourself , ’ he said			0
‘ i think if i ’d had a crystal ball when i was 13 or 14 and it had said i ’d get to play @entity2 every year , i ’d have been very happy with that			0
’ he ’s certainly had his share of adventures during his nine appearances to date			0
@entity19 might be the only player in @entity115 history to have led or had a share of the lead after every round bar the last one			1
his best chance so far of finishing on top after 72 holes came in 2007 , when he stood on the 17th hole tied for the lead only to run up a fatal double - bogey six			2
@entity126 celebrated his last - gasp @entity115 invitation with two eagle threes in a fine round of 68 ‘ @entity115 has probably been less on my mind this year because i am trying to find some form , ’ he admitted			1
‘ but i think the fact i ’ve had a number of great rounds there will always stand me in good stead			0
regardless of what happens here , i feel comfortable on that course and know i can manage my game even if it ’s not 100 per cent			0
you draw off the energy of the place			0
’ @entity48 has certainly done that over the years and perhaps the veteran lefty , a three - time @entity115 champion , is gearing himself up for another run at the green jacket			1
‘ it was a good start to the tournament and now i ’m looking for three more good rounds , ’ he said			0
' this is a big week for me			0
i felt the game was close last week			0
the only thing missing was chipping and short game			0
' @entity126 , like @entity48 another former winner of this event , celebrated his last - gasp @entity115 invitation with a fine round of 68 notable for two eagle threes			1
in the afternoon wave , @entity159 and @entity160 both made good starts to play their first six holes in two under .			0

@entity5 *bounced* back from @entity8 misery by *carding* 69 in @entity166
three - time masters champion @entity48 enjoyed return to form
@entity126 celebrated last - gasp @entity115 invitation with fine round of 68
