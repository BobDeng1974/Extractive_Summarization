by @entity0 published : 07:34 est , 9 november 2013 updated : 09:13 est , 9 november 2013 measles cases in a region hit by an epidemic less than four months ago have tripled in the last fortnight			0
there are now 36 cases of measles in south @entity8 , up from 13 just two weeks ago , as children from four schools have reported symptoms			1
doctors are urging parents to properly vaccinate their children after fears of a second epidemic in @entity17 have spread			2
cases of measles at four schools in south @entity8 have tripled in two weeks after doctors warned that two million children across the @entity23 have not had an @entity25 jab despite an uptake of @entity25 vaccinations during the outbreak which killed one and infected 1,200 last november , health chiefs warned that 30,000 children aged 10 - 18 are still unprotected			1
in april dr @entity32 , of @entity34 â€™s @entity33 , warned that two million children across the @entity23 are still unvaccinated , while figures showed 81 per cent of children in @entity37 had no protection from the disease			1
figured from @entity40 revealed that there are 300,000 children without an @entity25 jab that are being targetted by a new catchup campaign			1
@entity45 ( @entity46 ) said it was ' very frustrated ' that a significant number of young people had been given the first dose of an @entity25 vaccine , but had failed to follow it up with a booster shot within one month			1
parents are being urged to make sure their children have been given two @entity25 jabs to fully protect against the viral disease it continued to stress that two doses of the vaccination was the only way to protect against the outbreak			1
dr @entity60 , @entity46 consultant in communicable disease control , said : ' parents and young people should not underestimate how serious measles can be and how quickly it can spread			0
' in a school setting , one child with measles sitting in a classroom for just one hour will lead to at least 70 % of other pupils who are not vaccinated catching measles			0
' to prevent this outbreak from spreading even further , it 's crucial that unvaccinated children and young people receive two doses of @entity25 urgently and that those with symptoms do not attend school			1
' cases of measles have steadily risen since a now - discredited report by @entity81 claimed autism was linked to the @entity25 jab in the late 90s			1
the outbreak in 2012 lasted for more than eight months and sparked a massive vaccination programme			0
dr @entity60 added : ' parents who have decided not to vaccinate their children are not only risking their children 's health , but are putting other children at risk , children either too young to be vaccinated or with medical conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated			0
' we are very frustrated to see more cases of measles in the area so soon after the large outbreak earlier this year and we are very keen for this to be stopped before it can get any bigger and we return to a position where children are admitted to hospital or die or are damaged by the disease			2
a now - discredited report by @entity81 ( pictured centre ) in the late 90s linked the @entity25 injection with autism and scared many parents off vaccinating their children ' the only way to achieve that is through vaccination and i urge parents whose children have not received two doses of @entity25 to ensure that they speak to their gp immediately to arrange this quick , safe and effective vaccine			1
' adults who have either never had the disease or work in close contact with children are being encourage to speak to their gp about getting vaccinated as well			2
dr @entity126 of @entity40 said : ' it is important to remember that measles is highly infectious and spreads easily in the classroom			0
' children who are fully vaccinated with @entity25 help to stop the spread of measles and therefore to protect their friends and families			1
' this protection is particularly important for those who have health problems such as weakened immune systems and who can not be vaccinated but are at most risk if exposed to the disease			2
' those who have not received a dose of the @entity25 vaccine should contact their gp urgently			2
after the second dose individuals achieve almost complete protection			0
' measles is an airborne viral infection picked up after inhaling or touching droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes			0
children aged between one and four are the most vulnerable , and the infection can lead to blindness and even death			0
the symptoms include fever , sensitivity to light , red eyes , and greyish white spots near the mouth and throat			0
a red - brown spotty rash also develops around the ears and can spread around the head and neck before going to the legs and the rest of the body .			0

cases at four @entity8 schools rise from 13 to 36 in two weeks
around 30,000 children in the country have not been given @entity25 jab
nearly 300,000 children from @entity40 have not been properly vaccinated
around two million across the @entity23 have no protection against disease
