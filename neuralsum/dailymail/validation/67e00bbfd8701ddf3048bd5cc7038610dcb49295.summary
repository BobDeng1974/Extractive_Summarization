millions of patients are struggling to see their gp as surgeries are not open at a convenient time			1
nearly one in five said they can not easily make the appointments offered – despite promises that family doctors would extend their hours to evenings and weekends			1
the number of patients who are ' fairly or very dissatisfied ' with the opening hours at their surgery has risen by two million , or some 43 per cent , in the past three years alone , jumping from 3.7million in 2012 to 5.3million , the latest @entity10 found			1

they said that this is piling pressure on emergency departments as patients who can not get a gp appointment decide to go to @entity33 instead			0

@entity49 , of the @entity50 , said last week : ' gps are facing unprecedented pressures in trying to care for increasing numbers of patients with increasingly limited resources			2
