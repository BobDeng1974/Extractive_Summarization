@entity1 manager @entity0 believes @entity3 's below - par showing against @entity4 was a one off			1
hazard was @entity1 's startling performer last season and is likely to sign a new contract at @entity8 , staving off reported interest from @entity10 and @entity11			2

' i do n't know what he needs			0
i know he needs to play more than he did ( against @entity4 )			2
' he started the season well			0
@entity30 played good matches with us			0
' i think it 's more an isolated not good performance than a period			0
@entity37 ( r ) scores again to keep @entity1 at the top of the @entity20 table ' no dramas and ( i am ) not too much worried about it , but ( saturday ) was not his day , was not his performance			1
' it is likely @entity0 will give hazard another chance to return to his high - standard showings against @entity48 on tuesday in @entity49 @entity0 also hopes to select @entity37 for a second match in quick succession in @entity52 , but it remains to be seen how the prolific striker recovers , given his fragile hamstrings .			0
