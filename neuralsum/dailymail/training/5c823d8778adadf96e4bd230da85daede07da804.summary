the family holiday memories or even my first kiss which is horrible			2

scene of smash : her parents were told four times it was likely she would die after the horrific crash on the @entity29 , a winding road from @entity31 to @entity32 amnesia is the name given to a disturbance in the ability to recall stored memories			1
it is usually caused by disease or head injury , but in rare cases can occur apparently spontaneously			1
the memory loss associated with amnesia can include everything from a person 's past or just portions of it			2
in most cases , it is a temporary condition , lasting from a few seconds to a few hours			0
but in severe cases , it can last months or even years			0
there are several different types of amnesia			0
retrograde amnesia is an inability to remember any events that occurred before the accident or illness			0
usually , the affected person can not remember events shortly before their accident or illness at all , but their memories of the distant past are intact , and there is a gradient of memory loss between the two extremes			0
retrograde amnesia often lasts for a year , before the patient starts to remember things			0
but in some cases where the trauma to the head has been severe , memory may never be recovered			1
' we were told she ’d be unlikely to ever leave hospital			1
one consultant even said there was a point when they might be asking to withdraw treatment			0
' but the prayer really worked			0
she did n’t get a serious infection , she did n’t get bedsores , and she started to kick her legs around			0
we ’d been told she ’d never come out of the coma , so that was exciting			1

@entity25 knows that she got an a * for her @entity162 literature and language @entity160			0
' i still have trouble remember things now which is part of the after affects of my brain injuries			1
i can remember things but i will have some short - term memory loss now and again			2
' a talented musician and writer @entity25 now helps other families whose loved ones are in comas , reassuring them to never give up hope			0
@entity25 said : ' when i woke up they said i would never walk or talk			0
i would just breathe and be a permanent vegetable			0
they were a bit wrong			0
' my mum and dad had faith in me and because of that faith that got me out of my coma i believe			0
' i want to show people just how much a brain injured person can do			1
' i had to relearn to walk and talk and do everything again			0
