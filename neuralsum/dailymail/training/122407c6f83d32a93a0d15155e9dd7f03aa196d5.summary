by @entity0 published : 15:57 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 18:13 est , 20 august 2013 an annual list of the richest lawmakers in the @entity3 was released today and taking the number one spot is representative @entity5 of @entity6			1
the @entity7 earned his estimated $ 355.4 million through his @entity9 car alarm company — ironically , since he 's been accused by opponents of having himself been a car thief in his youth — and represents the @entity13 ’s 49th district			1
though @entity5 is identifiable by many for his visible opposition to president @entity16 , he ’s surprisingly less well known than some of his colleagues on the list of @entity3 ’s least wealthy members			2
@entity30 , whose wife inherited a healthy chunk of the @entity37 ketchup fortune , was often at the top of the list released annually by @entity41 congressional newspaper @entity40			0
now @entity5 has more money than anyone else in @entity3			2
he ’s also chairman of the @entity44 , a job that often pits him against the @entity47 president			0
each year , @entity41 congressional newspaper @entity40 releases the top 50 wealthiest @entity33 representatives and @entity49			0
topping the list was @entity6 congressman @entity5 , whose @entity9 car alarm company , well known for their television commercials and talking warnings , led him to become a self - made millionaire			1
here 's the worth of the richest 10 of the richest 50 : saucy : former senator @entity30 once held the title thanks to wife @entity59 's ketchup fortune it should be noted , however , that while @entity5 has served as a congressman under president @entity16 , his personal wealth has more than doubled			1
the @entity66 native , though a watchdog of the president , has for years taken heat for unproven accusations that he actually stole cars , instead of protecting them , in the 1970s			0
just behind @entity5 , in the number two spot , is the man who held the title of number one richest congressman — @entity7 representative from @entity77 @entity76			1
@entity76 , who oversees the @entity78 , is worth an estimated $ 101.9 million thanks to his wife ’s family business — @entity81			1
at the opposite end of the spectrum are @entity3 ’s least wealthy members , some of whom are often cited as 2016 presidential contenders according to the @entity88			0
the other half : with the wealthiest lawmakers must come the least wealthy			0
among them are senators @entity92 of @entity93 ( right , with $ 455,000 ) and @entity94 ( left , with $ 166,000 ) sweating it : likely 2016 presidential contender senator @entity96 of @entity97 actually has a negative net worth of $ 190,000 likely presidential candidate and @entity93 @entity7 @entity92 , the @entity101 darling son of two - time presidential also - ran @entity102 , clocks in with the relatively paltry worth of about $ 455,000			1
@entity105 ’s senator @entity94 , whose name is also sometimes batted around in the 2016 echo chamber , is worth even less with assets roughly totaling $ 166,000			2
and finally , @entity96 , another name synonymous with 2016 @entity33 hopes , is actually well in the red			0
the senator from @entity97 is worth negative $ 190,000 .			0

@entity5 is worth an estimated $ 355.4 million thanks to his viper car alarm company
' protected by @entity9 . stand back ! ' : in fact , the richest representative was the voice of the once common talking car alarms
