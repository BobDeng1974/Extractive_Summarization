by @entity1 correspondent the dream of creating ethically sound stem cells on a large scale to combat diseases from @entity6 ’s to cancer is closer to being realised			1
scientists say they have found a way to produce stem cells that overcome the issues relating to the death of the embryos			1
and the method for cultivating large quantities of cells involves no animal products or human cells that could introduce contaminants , the @entity15 researchers say in the journal @entity23			2
the dream of being able to use stem cells as a repair kit for diseases from @entity6 's to cancer is now a step closer to being realised stem cells – ‘ master cells ’ capable of turning into other cell types – are widely seen as a repair kit for the body			1
embryonic stem cells , plucked from embryos in the first days of life , are the most versatile and so offer the most promise			1

embryonic stem cells , plucked from embryos in the first days of life , are the most versatile and so offer the most promise			1
however , their use is mired in controversy , because they have to be extracted in such large numbers that the embryo dies			1
but researchers from @entity51 ’s @entity50 say they have found a way of safely removing a single , precious stem cell			2
the method is already used in ivf treatments and so it is known that the remainder of the embryo can still turn into a baby			0

the method is already used in @entity66 and so it is known that the remainder of the embryo can still become a baby			0
researcher @entity70 said : ‘ we know the embryo can survive the removal of a single cell			0
this makes a huge ethical difference			0
’ just as importantly , the @entity15 have also worked out how to make the lone cell grow and multiply , using a lab - made version of a protein that is found in the embryo			2
@entity82 experts said the breakthrough would be welcomed but cautioned that the removal of even a single cell from a fledgling embryo is not without risk			0
professor @entity88 said : ‘ using this technology , the supply of human embryonic stem cells is no longer a problem			1
‘ it will be possible to establish a bank where stem cells can be matched by tissue type , which is important for avoiding transplants being rejected			0
’ another possibility is a single stem cell could be removed from an embryo before @entity66 treatment and then used to generate tailor - made treatments should that baby become ill later in life			1
@entity82 experts said the breakthrough would be welcomed by those battling devastating diseases but cautioned that the removal of even a single cell from a fledgling embryo is not without risk			0
scientists think their discovery could eventually lead to cures for diabetes , cancer , @entity6 's and parkinson 's disease @entity116 , an @entity117 ivf expert , said : ‘ a method capable of providing a reliable supply of stem cells , without harming human embryos , could prove to be a wonderful advance			1
‘ the method is a promising development , although it probably wo n’t entirely eliminate ethical issues			0
‘ it is true that a single cell can be removed from very early embryos , but the procedure does carry a small risk that the embryos will not survive			0
‘ despite these limitations , the research seems to be on the right track and will undoubtedly be welcomed by patients affected by a wide variety of crippling diseases			0

@entity15 scientists say they have *written* the recipe for making ethically *acceptable* , *highly* versatile stem cells in large numbers
the embryonic stem cells could be banked and turned into treatments for patients who need to *replace* diseased , *damaged* and worn out body parts
*previously* , taking stem cells from embryos resulted in the embryo 's death but scientists can now remove just one stem cell meaning the baby survives
