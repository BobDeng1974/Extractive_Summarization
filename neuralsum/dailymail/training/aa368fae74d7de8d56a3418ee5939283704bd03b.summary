by @entity0 published : 09:48 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 12:30 est , 23 october 2012 a second world war veteran who risked his life to transport vital supplies to the @entity4 has spoken of his anger at being denied a bravery medal by the @entity8 government			1
@entity9 , 93 , has been offered a medal by @entity11 for his role in the 1941 - 1945 @entity13 , but @entity8 rules on foreign military honours bar him from accepting it			1
the @entity11 embassy recently offered the @entity19 medal for valour to all survivors of the perilous missions to deliver food and munitions to allies on the @entity26 , on which 3,000 sailors died			1
' it 's a farce ' : @entity9 , 93 , has been told @entity8 rules ban him from accepting an award from @entity11 in recognition of his service on the @entity35 @entity34 convoys they have already given the honour to veterans from @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
but @entity9 , who braved @entity43 torpedo attacks on two convoys in may and october 1942 , has been told that @entity46 red tape prevents him and other veterans from claiming the medal			1
under the rules , former @entity8 soldiers are not allowed to accept military medals from foreign governments - unless it awards service performed in the past five years or there is no equivalent medal in @entity8			1
unrecognised : @entity9 as a young sailor , left , and the letter from foreign secretary @entity59 to @entity9 's mp @entity60 but veterans ' groups say that the @entity19 medal is a bravery award , and can therefore be awarded in addition to campaign medals that recognise service			1
@entity71 - of - four @entity9 , who lives in @entity68 , @entity69 , with wife @entity70 , 87 , said : ' it 's a farce			2
it seems like they have been trying to sort out [ what recognition we should get ] for years			0
' i would like to receive the @entity11 medal			2
the @entity11 embassy has the silver medal in its possession so it 's just waiting for our government to give it the go - ahead			1
' perilous : 3,000 sailors died on the @entity34 convoys hellish : sailors braved freezing conditions to deliver essential food and munitions to the @entity4 the @entity8 government has repeatedly denied the @entity34 convoy survivors a campaign medal of their own , insisting the @entity96 medal is sufficient			1
veterans say the @entity96 is inadequate , as it was created in recognition of a separate @entity100 campaign and extended to include those who served on the convoys			0
the fight to overturn the government ruling has now been taken up by the @entity106 mp for @entity107 @entity60			0
and @entity9 's friends at community group @entity109 , plan to conduct a ceremony in his honour - regardless of what the government decides			2
@entity114 , from the group , said : ' @entity9 is 93 and in poor health and i do n't see why he should not be honoured in this way			2
it seems mean - spirited of the @entity8 government			0
' a spokesman for the foreign office said : ' we very much appreciate the @entity11 government 's wish to recognise the brave and valuable service given by veterans of the @entity13			1
the @entity34 covoys delivered essential supplies to the @entity4 during the darkest part of the @entity35			1
with naval escorts , around 1400 merchant vessels sailed from @entity8 , @entity132 and @entity41 to the @entity4 ports of @entity134 and @entity135			2
the convoys carried food , munitions , weapons and vehicles donated under the @entity142 ' lend - lease agreement			0
these supplies were vital to @entity11 troops on the @entity26 , particularly those resisting the siege of @entity147			2
85 merchant vessels and 16 @entity150 warships were lost over the course of the campaign			0
' however , the @entity153 on the acceptance of foreign awards clearly state that in order for permission to be given for an award to be accepted , there has to have been specific service to the country concerned and that that service should have taken place within the previous five years			0
' additionally , permission can not be granted if they have received , or are expected to receive , a @entity8 award for the same services			0
all @entity8 veterans of the convoys were eligible for the @entity170 '			0
additionally , a lapel badge ( the " @entity172 " ) was introduced in 2006 and some 10,000 have been issued			0
' we look at each request for permission to confer a foreign or @entity178 state award upon a @entity8 citizen on an individual case by case basis			0
we can never comment on individual cases , but , in general terms , the @entity11 government would need to provide evidence of direct support for @entity11 in the last five years for any @entity8 citizen to be awarded the @entity188			0

@entity9 , 93 , took part in missions to deliver supplies to the @entity4
convoy veterans have been offered @entity11 's @entity19 medal for valour
@entity46 rules bar veterans from accepting foreign medals for service already recognised
