wales have reacted to criticism of their handling of @entity3 last friday by insisting that he would have been replaced immediately had they known he had been knocked out			1
the @entity7 wing was left unconscious by a second blow to the head during his side ’s 21 - 16 @entity11 loss to @entity14 at the @entity15 , but he was not taken off			1
team medical manager @entity17 on monday night revealed that steps will be taken to ensure better access to tv coverage after confirming that he and his colleagues were unaware of the extent of @entity24 ’s injury			1
in the first half , @entity25 accidentally struck @entity24 in the head with his boot and the 22 - year - old was forced to go off for concussion tests , returning to the field eight minutes later			1
@entity24 ( bottom ) is inadvertently kicked in the face by @entity14 second row @entity25 on friday the @entity0 wing appeared to be knocked out twice during his side 's 21 - 16 @entity11 loss against @entity14 @entity24 's ( right ) second apparent case of concussion came after a clash of heads with @entity43 ( left ) attempting to tackle @entity14 fullback @entity45 ( centre right ) , @entity43 's momentum also takes @entity24 @entity24 lays motionless on the @entity15 turf after the nasty - looking collision on friday night in the second half , @entity3 clashed heads with team - mate @entity43 and collapsed to the ground with his arms by his sides — a clear indication of concussion			1
however , he was not taken off at that stage for assessment and played the final quarter in a dazed state			1
the vivid footage of his ordeal has led to a torrent of criticism aimed at the @entity64 and last night — with @entity65 continuing an investigation into the events — @entity17 said : ‘ regrettably , i was unsighted at the time of the second incident			1
the other pitch - side medic was also unsighted and all i saw was @entity3 getting up off his knees			1
when i arrived on the scene he was completely lucid , conversing spontaneously with me			0
i undertook some on - pitch evaluations and at that point i deemed him fit to continue			2
the 22 - year - old ( left ) , missing a tackle on @entity77 , saw his game suffer after the first head injury ‘ regrettably , we did n’t get a chance to see the incident and had i been given that opportunity there ’s no doubt that he would have been removed from the field of play			1
there are no pitch - side replays available currently and the independent match - day doctor was also unable to aid us in that process			2
we unfortunately did n’t see it			0
having seen it since , he looks like he had a momentary loss of consciousness and in that case , he should definitely have been removed from the field of play			2
’ @entity17 suggested that the @entity0 coaches and analysts also missed the incident as they were reviewing an incident that occurred moments earlier			1
but he conceded that the process of monitoring such injuries was insufficient and will be immediately acted upon			0
‘ we ’ve seen where our protocols need to improve , ’ he said			0
‘ for the next four games of the @entity11 we ’re going to have instant video replays			0
we ’ve had a discussion with @entity65 and we hope that our discussions might spark some global intervention because sometimes pitch - side practitioners will need help			1
there will be rare occasions , like on friday , where people are unsighted , so we need to enhance these protocols			0
’ @entity3 ( right ) and his captain @entity117 look on during @entity0 ' defeat to @entity14 @entity3 puts his hands on his knees and looks on during @entity0 ' loss to @entity14 at the @entity15 in a detailed post-match examination and all subsequent tests , @entity24 has been deemed to be free of any concussion symptoms , and he appeared at a sponsors ’ event yesterday			1
however , having belatedly viewed the alarming footage of the incident @entity0 have put him through return - to - play protocols as if he had been concussed			1
a decision will be made later in the week about his availability to face @entity132 at @entity133 on sunday			1
meanwhile , @entity14 head coach @entity134 says facilities to monitor live footage are available to his management and medical team at @entity139			1
‘ there are definitely lessons to be learned , ’ he said			0
‘ at the time , i did n’t see it — i do n’t know if anyone did			0
clearly , the ability to review footage and identify if a concussion has taken place is crucial			0
my understanding is that we do have that provision in place at @entity139			0
’ @entity65 , formerly known as the @entity152 , have drafted the following guidelines : what is concussion ? a traumatic brain injury resulting in a disturbance of brain function			1
common symptoms include headache , dizziness , memory disturbance or balance problems			0
loss of consciousness , being knocked out , occurs in less than 10 per cent of concussions			2
what action do you take if you suspect concussion ? the athlete should be immediately removed from play			0
once safely removed from play , the injured player must not be returned to activity that day and until they are assessed			0
concussion has been diagnosed , what next ? a six - day graduated return to play programme ( @entity178 ) : 1 - rest for 24 hours — complete body and brain rest			2
2 - light aerobic exercise to increase heart rate			2
light jogging for 10 - 15 minutes , swimming or stationary cycling at low to moderate intensity			2
3 - sport - specific exercise to add movement			2
running drills , no head impact activities			0
4 - non-contact training drills to test co-ordination and cognitive load			2
may start progressive resistance training			0
5 - full contact practice so that functional skills can be assessed by coaching staff			0
6 - @entity200 can return to play .			0
