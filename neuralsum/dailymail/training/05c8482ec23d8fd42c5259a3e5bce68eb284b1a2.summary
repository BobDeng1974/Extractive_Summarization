by @entity0 published : 13:02 est , 19 may 2013 updated : 13:02 est , 19 may 2013 the number of people dying from unbearable heat in big cities could almost double because of climate change , according to new research			2
a study in @entity9 found the number of fatalities caused by global warming will far outstrip the reductions in those perishing from the cold			1
it follows a report last year by the @entity18 that warned heat related deaths in the @entity20 will increase by more than 10,000 annually - a fivefold rise			1
the study found that heat related deaths in @entity24 could rise by 91 percent in the 2080s the latest paper used projections from 16 global climate models under two different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios to predict temperature related deaths in the 2020s , 2050s and 2080s			1
in one , heat related deaths rose by 91 percent in the 2080s , compared to the annual average of 369 in the @entity37 's most densely populated borough in the 1980s			1
the decrease of 34.1 percent in the 340 cold related deaths during the same period meant an overall rise in temperature related deaths of 31 percent			1
another table based on alternative calculations predicted a 50 percent increase in ' heat ' deaths and a 22.1 percent fall in ' cold ' deaths , a net rise in ' temperature related deaths ' of 15.5 percent			1
the scenarios also forecast heat deaths will rise by 21.5 percent or 22.2 percent in the 2020s and cold deaths fall by 12.2 percent or 11.1 percent , a 5.3 percent or 6.2 percent increase in temperature related deaths respectively			1
the @entity18 fears old people restricted to their homes and patients in hospital will be unable to cope and in the 2050s heat deaths will rise by 36.9 percent or 49.4 percent and cold deaths fall by 17.3 percent or 21.5 per cent , a net rise in ' temperature ' deaths of 10.9 percent or 15.4 percent			1
the researchers said their findings published in @entity62 highlight the importance of public health risk management in response to global warming			0
they said rising temperatures in urban areas may lead to increased heat related mortality as well as reduced cold related mortality but until now the overall annual effect has been largely uncertain			1
the impacts on estimated annual mortality from the different models and scenarios were similar in the 2020s , but began to diverge in the 2050s and differed substantially by the 2080s			0
the pattern of divergence in mortality mirrors a similar pattern in projected warming			0
large increases in the percentage of annual mortality occurred in may and september , when absolute mortality associated with temperature is relatively low at present			0
the @entity9 based study said that the number of people dying from global warming will be far more than the number who will be saved from the cold the researchers suggest that adaptation planning strategies for the public health sector may need to consider promoting vigilance outside the traditional high ' heat risk ' months between june and august			1
professor @entity102 , of @entity103 , @entity24 , said : ' the impact of warming temperatures on population health is of increasing concern to health practitioners and policy makers			2
' urban areas such as @entity24 are especially vulnerable to temperature extremes owing to the high concentration of susceptible populations , as well as enhancement of temperatures due to the urban heat island effects			2
' temperatures in the @entity24 region increased by 2 c between 1901 and 2000 , substantially exceeding global and @entity121 national trends			0
preparing for and preventing temperature related health problems has beenidentified as a high priority topic by @entity24 's government			2
' the urban ' heat island ' phenomenon relates to big cities where buildings and asphalt help capture the sun 's light resulting in warmer temperatures			0
added prof @entity102 : ' all 32 projections yielded warm season increases and cold season decreases in temperature related mortality , with positive net annual temperature related deaths in allcases			2
' monthly analyses showed the largest percentage increases may occur in may and september			0
' these results suggest that , over a range of models and scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions , increases in heat - related mortality could outweigh reductions in cold - related mortality , with shifting seasonal patterns			0
' at the moment 2,000 people in the @entity20 die every year as a result of heat waves , mostly the old and vulnerable who find it difficult to cool down			2
but by 2080 the temperature in towns and cities could rise by @entity160 , peaking at up to @entity161 ( @entity162 ) in @entity163 , in the summer for several days			0
people in big cities , such as @entity166 ( pictured ) , could suffer as a result of rising temperatures the @entity18 fears old people restricted to their homes and patients in hospital will be unable to cope			0
in a report on climate change , the @entity173 predicted almost 12,000 ' heat related deaths ' by the 2080s , an increase of more than 500 per cent			1
the problem is even worse if the ' heat island effect ' is included			0
rising temperatures could also mean that @entity20 people may contract exotic illnesses at home as new species of mosquito , that carry tropical diseases such as dengue fever and chikungunya , could migrate to the @entity20 .			0

a study in @entity9 found the number of deaths will increase by 2100
it found that heat related deaths in @entity24 could rise by 91 percent in the 2080s
@entity18 say heat related deaths in the @entity20 will increase by 10,000 annually
