by @entity0 the last remaining women code - breakers who operated @entity2 - the world ’s first computer - have been reunited after 70 years after a picture of them was published in a local paper			1
the women were all part of the @entity9 at @entity10 in @entity11 during the @entity12 and were the world ’s first computer operators			1
most of them lost touch with each other after the war ended and they have not been together as a group for seven decades			0
this rare picture , taken at @entity10 where photography during wartime were strictly forbidden , shows the female code breakers			1
@entity30 ) today : six surviving women reunited after 70 years next to a replica of the colossus machine which they operated their reunion happened after a rare picture of the @entity36 was discovered in a drawer by veteran @entity29 , 88 , from @entity11			1
the photo , which was taken at the end of the @entity12 , shows around 40 women dressed in smart berets and ties			1
it is believed to be one of only a handful in existence as photos were not meant to be taken at @entity10 during the war years			1
the huge colossus computer was designed to break @entity51 ciphers used to encode messages between @entity53 and the rest of his high command vital work : women played a variety of roles from lowly clerks to operating machines and breaking into ciphers and codes the women spotted themselves in the photo after it was published in the national papers to mark the 70th anniversary of @entity2			1
they gathered together at @entity10 , where they were shown a fully - functioning @entity2 , which was rebuilt and unveiled in 2007			2
@entity29 said : ' in war time you were n’t really meant to take photos so i kept it very safe in my bureau , but i had forgotten all about it and only found it when i was looking for something else			0
' it was lovely to see everyone and be all together again after such a long time			0
’ it was on 5 february 1944 that @entity82 i tackled its first @entity84 - encrypted message , the highly sophisticated cipher used in communications between @entity53 and his generals during @entity12 @entity25 , 87 was delighted to be reunited with members of the @entity36 ( @entity36 )			1
most of them lost touch with each other after the war ended and they have not been together as a group for seven decades @entity26 , 87 , also featured in the photo which is believed to be one of only a handful in existence as photos were not meant to be taken at @entity10 during the war years @entity27 , was also part of the group which were reunited after it was printed in a newspaper @entity28 , 87 , from @entity103 , @entity104 , who joined the @entity36 aged 18 @entity29 then and now			1
the reunion was organised after a rare picture of the @entity36 was discovered in a drawer by ms @entity29 , 88 , from @entity11 @entity30 , 89 , worked at @entity10 as a registrar before going on to become a speech therapist after the war @entity2 was designed by @entity112 telephone engineer @entity111 to speed up code - breaking of the complex @entity84 cipher			1
by the end of the war there were ten functioning colossus machines and they had a decisive impact in shortening the war and saving countless lives			0
@entity2 was the first electronic computer , but news of its existence was kept top secret for 30 years because of the sophistication and sensitivity surrounding the encryption it had helped to break			2
the computer was enormous , measuring 7ft high by 17ft wide and 11ft deep , weighing a tonne and using @entity132 of power			0
it incorporated 2,500 valves , 501 of which are thyraton switches , about 100 logic gates and 10,000 resistors connected by 7 km of wiring			0
back to reality : of the 9,000 women who worked at @entity10 during @entity12 , just 600 went on to join the fledgling @entity144 or other branches of the secret services groundbreaking : but the work of female codebreakers was n't always given the recognition it deserved at the time			1
reading 5000 characters per second - faster than anything ever produced commercially ever since - it found the start wheel positions of @entity84 messages			0
it usually took @entity2 up to three or four hours to establish the start wheel positions of messages , but it is often surmised that the @entity159 might have been reading some of the decrypted messages before they reached @entity161			0
by the end of the war , 63 million characters of high - grade @entity51 messages had been decrypted by the 550 people working on breaking @entity84			1
in honour of the men and women who worked at @entity10 during the war , @entity167 , co-founder of @entity168 , led a team to rebuild @entity2 in 1994			1
on 15 november 2007 , a rebuilt fully - functioning @entity2 was unveiled to the public at @entity168			0
the women were part of the @entity9 watch at @entity10 ( pictured ) in @entity11 during the @entity12 the intelligence war waging in a quiet corner of @entity11 was to be decisive in the @entity159 effort to win the @entity12			1
@entity10 - known now as @entity10 - was the hub of @entity112 's code - backing effort , where hugely talented mathematicians and inventors worked tirelessly to give the armed forces a crucial helping - hand			2
@entity188 - educated mathematical genius @entity186 as @entity192 himself made clear , the accurate information which flowed from @entity10 every day , at a rate which sometimes reached 6,000 messages a day , saved lives and gave @entity112 a crucial edge in battle			2
@entity186 , the @entity188 - educated mathematical genius , and @entity198 engineer @entity111 , are the two most celebrated figures whose innovations greatly improved the @entity159 ability to decipher @entity51 messages			2
the enigma machine , which was on sale commercially in the 1920s , was modified by the @entity51 to make it more secure			2
they trusted completely that its codes were unbreakable , and used it for all manner of important communications			0
however , it was thwarted in part thanks to @entity186 's ' @entity215 , which was able to speed up the code - breaking process immeasurably			0
@entity186 based his invention on a @entity219 device , the ' @entity220 ' , which was handed over to @entity112 just weeks before @entity219 was invaded in 1939			0
it was not able to decipher @entity51 codes automatically , but once analysts had manually deciphered a few letters by picking out common words , such as the names of @entity51 generals or short words such as ' to ' and ' they ' , the device could rapidly test hundreds of other possibilities to put together a code			1
over 100 of the machines were built to aid the code - breaking effort , but they were all destroyed when the war ended			0
a replica was built in 2008 , and can be seen at @entity10 , which is now a museum			0
the quest to beat the @entity51 intelligence services also resulted in the construction of the world 's first proper computer - called @entity2			2
developed by @entity111 from a network of thousands of electronic valves , the device was able to crack the @entity245 , which the @entity247 high command used for messages deemed too sensitive for @entity251 transmission			0
the @entity2 , which was five times faster than the original , was finished less than a week before the @entity252 , and gave the @entity159 another crucial edge in the last phase of the war .			0

six women worked on the colossus machine at @entity10 during @entity12
computer was *responsible* for breaking @entity51 codes used in messages
seventy years after they worked together , the women have reunited
rare picture taken at @entity267 brought the former *colleagues* together
