looking back , @entity0 gave a telling clue about the precocious talent and mental strength that @entity4 hope to harness on saturday , when he scored eight tries in a junior rugby league match – at the age of nine			1
he was playing against older boys			2
that did n’t faze him			2
he was playing against bigger boys			2
that did n’t faze him either			2
such a scenario would become the norm in his fast - track rise to the heights			2
but back then , he also had to deal with good - natured banter from members of @entity21 ’s famous @entity20 clan , which he duly made a mockery of			1
@entity0 ’s brother , sale fly - half @entity24 , recalled their formative years in both codes and told @entity28 : ‘ the biggest game that stands out for me was when @entity0 played for @entity30 against @entity31 ’s , which is the team @entity20 used to play for			1
they are the biggest rugby league amateur club and @entity0 was in an age - group above himself			1
@entity0 is set to take @entity4 's no 10 shirt for the first time against @entity38 on saturday @entity39 trains with his team - mates ahead of @entity4 's @entity41 at @entity42 @entity39 practices with @entity20 ( left ) who he has played with since his childhood the @entity46 fly - half releases the ball as @entity4 are put through their paces at the @entity49 ‘ at the time , my dad was coaching @entity52 and @entity54 ’s twin brothers played for @entity52			1
they were giving @entity0 a lot of stick before the game , saying that they were going to get smashed			1
the next day he scored eight tries			2
’ the prodigious playmaker who will wear @entity4 ’s no 10 shirt for the first time on saturday , against @entity38 at @entity42 , grew up in a rugby household , but league was the code of choice			1
he and @entity24 would watch their father , @entity65 , play for @entity67 and then act as player - coach at @entity52			1
from the age of four , @entity0 and his older brother would come along to training , watch the team in action and try to emulate them			1
@entity75 was an @entity52 player at the time and he went on to coach @entity77 at @entity78			2
he said : ‘ @entity0 and @entity24 used to come to training with @entity65 and you would see the pair of them with a rugby ball in their hands constantly			1
they were always practising their passing and kicking			2
for however long we were training , they would be doing exactly the same with the ball			0
’ over the years that followed , the chosen practice location would be @entity95 playing fields , up on the hills of @entity97 , just outside @entity52			0
that is where @entity65 would take them to hone their kicking			0
when he was away , their mum , @entity105 , drove them there to train and train			0
former @entity4 coach @entity107 ( left ) poses with his sons @entity0 ( centre ) , 14 , and @entity24 ( right ) , 17 as a youngster , @entity39 took inspiration from rugby league star @entity112 ( centre ) brother @entity24 , who plays for @entity114 , insists @entity0 has to conviction to own the @entity4 no 10 shirt it helped that there was inspiration at close quarters			1
@entity121 , ‘ @entity122 ’ , was our next - door neighbour and he treated us really well , like sons , ’ said @entity24			1
‘ he was always out the front , throwing balls around with us			0
he was @entity0 ’s favourite player			1
‘ @entity0 and i always played a lot of one - on - one , so there was always a bit of competition			1
@entity0 always had a @entity132 shirt on with ‘ @entity122 ’ on the back			1
he never took that off			0
i was more mixed ; i went round the houses a bit , but @entity0 was always loyal to @entity122 ! ’ when @entity65 ’s coaching career took him from @entity52 to a role with @entity142 in union , his sons relished the opportunity for some informal tuition from @entity41 players			1
as a surreal twist , years later @entity0 finds himself forming a half - back partnership at @entity46 with one of the players – @entity150 – who made him and his brother feel so welcome on their visit			1
‘ we went into @entity142 camp with my dad , ’ said @entity24			1
‘ we spent a week with him , which was good			0
we got to work on our kicking with @entity159 and @entity160 , which was great			0
it was just before the 2003 @entity163 and we spent a week with them in @entity165			0
@entity150 was in camp then and he took us out for an ice cream ! ’ @entity39 ( left ) switched codes from rugby league to start his union career with @entity170 @entity39 ( centre ) joined @entity46 after the 2013 season having won two trophies with @entity170 the @entity46 star now plays alongside @entity150 - who bought the young brothers ice cream as children at school , @entity0 made a profound impression with his dedication and work ethic , in the class room as well as on the rugby pitch			1
aside from a spell down in @entity187 – at the same school as @entity20 – while @entity65 was coaching at @entity189 , most of his education took place at @entity191 near @entity192			1
the head of sport , @entity193 , recalls how he quickly made his mark			0
‘ he came to us as a rugby league lad , ’ he said			0
‘ he was a phenomenal player , but i do n’t think he had played rugby union at that stage			0
he had obviously watched it and he knew about it , but all his skills were from league			0
‘ my first memory of @entity0 playing rugby union was a game on our pitches here ; on the junior , under 12 - sized pitch			1
we were playing @entity211 , who are a decent rugby school			0
i was refereeing and it was the first time i had seen @entity0 play			1
‘ their no 8 picked the ball up off the back of a scrum and someone had obviously taught him to run straight at the 10 , to see what they were made of			0
so he ran straight at @entity77 and @entity222 just nicked the ball off him			0
he did n’t even bother tackling him , he just nicked the ball , ran to the other end and scored			0
no - one could believe what happened			2
i just stood there and thought , “ wow ”			0
’ @entity39 ( left ) played with @entity20 ( right ) for @entity4 at the @entity228 in 2011 the pair are now set to star for @entity4 seniors when they try and reverse a losing streak against @entity38 @entity4 skills coach @entity232 ( left ) talks to @entity20 and @entity39 during training in @entity234 @entity235 : season 5 , @entity237 2008 @entity4 under 16 teammates			1
@entity20 captained the side , @entity39 had just turned 15			1
2008 - 09 @entity4 under 18 team - mates			1
toured @entity241 together in 2008			0
2011 @entity4 under 20 teammates			1
lost 33 - 22 to @entity247 in @entity249 final			2
2014 @entity39 made senior debut off the bench at @entity42 as a replacement for @entity20 against @entity253 in the @entity246			1
the gifted tyro possessed all the technical attributes required , but what struck @entity193 was the mind - set he had , which set him apart			2
‘ @entity0 was a role model here , ’ he said			1
‘ it was n’t just in his rugby			0
he had a full timetable but his work was always first in			0
‘ he was a grafter and well organised – all with a view to the rugby			0
from a very young age , he was exceptionally driven , knew what he wanted to do and appreciated the sacrifices that had to be made			0
at 13 and 14 , he knew what he would have to give up and how to get the best out of himself			0
‘ it was clear that he would make it , not so much because of his skills - set , but because of his personality			2
more than anyone i ’ve come into contact with , not just in an educational sphere but in all walks of life , there was no doubt he would succeed because he was so driven			0
’ that drive would ultimately propel @entity0 into professional rugby union , where he became the youngest debutant in the history of the sport in this country – aged 16 years and 237 days – and was voted the @entity291 ’s world @entity289 in 2011			2
it also led to him switching from @entity170 to @entity46 , in the belief that he was ready to play week after week , and run the show			1
@entity39 takes a penalty kick during @entity4 's narrow defeat by @entity242 last saturday @entity4 are still searching for a first win this autumn after losing to @entity247 and @entity242 @entity75 saw that trait in him too , when he was at @entity78			1
‘ the thing with @entity0 is that he always stood out , ’ he said			2
‘ he was a year below the other lads , but he was still the stand - out player			2
it was n’t always because of the way he played rugby , it was also about the way he approached the game ; his attitude			0
that ’s probably the most impressive thing about him			0
‘ from a young age , everyone could see that @entity0 had a special talent , from the way he came across and the way he did things over and over again until he was good at them			2
he always seemed to be destined for great things			0
he will cope with it on saturday , without a doubt			2
this is what he has always wanted to do			0
it ’s like this was destined to be			0
’ @entity24 has similarly strong conviction that his brother can handle the magnitude of what awaits him			1
‘ there are a lot of good 10s around but , speaking to him , he is quite determined to take this chance and keep the shirt , ’ he said			0
’ the kind of character he is , i would n’t be surprised if he did it			0
