self - titled welfare queen @entity0 has once again fanned the flames of anger over her right to claim benefits to support her eight children			1
the 33 - year - old , of @entity7 in @entity8 , who lives in a council house and receives handouts of £ 26,000 a year , appeared on today 's @entity12 to feature in a debate on the government 's proposed cap on benefits			1
in last week 's @entity17 , she said a cap at £ 23,000 would leave her and her young family struggling to survive			1
she appeared on the @entity21 show today to further argue her case			1
i did n't chose to be left on my own			2
i use the money to raise my eight children , they will go to school and university and hopefully get jobs to put back into system			0
' @entity0 , who has been on benefits since she was 19 , said she is ' eager ' to work but she has struggled to find a job she can fit in around her commitments as a single mother			1
' there 's eight children , they could go to after school club and breakfast club but if they are ill what do i do ? ' she said			2
' i did get a job but as i struggled to get them all ready in morning , i had to call and tell them i could n't attend , ' she said			2
' i tried for another job working 16 hours a week but they said no as my face is known from the papers			0
i am eager to work , i would be a cleaner			0
i have an appointment at the job centre tomorrow			0
' @entity0 cares for @entity65 , 12 , @entity66 , 11 , @entity67 , nine , @entity68 , eight , @entity69 , six , @entity70 , four , @entity71 , two , and @entity72 , one , on her own after she split up with their father			2
she said he 's ' a working man ' who only sees his children at weekends			0
broadcaster @entity77 , who appeared on the @entity21 show to debate with @entity0 , asked her why she carried on having children when she knew she could n't support them			1
the 46 - year - old from @entity81 , who is married with an eight - year - old daughter , said : ' it 's your sense of entitlement that makes people angry			1
you made a choice to have eight children			0
' she accused @entity0 of abusing the welfare system			2
' most mothers work whether they are single or married because it 's the right thing to do , the only way we can afford welfare is because people work , ' she argued			1
@entity0 is raising @entity65 , 12 , @entity66 , 11 , @entity67 , nine , @entity68 , eight , @entity69 , six , @entity70 , four , @entity71 , two , and @entity72 , one , on her own after she split up with their father ' you are bright and in good health , you have a moral duty to work , ' she told @entity103			1
' how can you expect to live the life you want and expect everyone else to pay for it ? you 're telling everyone we are mugs for going to work			1
why do n't we all not work and get benefits ? ' @entity30 said @entity0 has no excuse not to work as there are thousands of jobs for cleaners available and many other single mothers manage to get their children organised so they can hold down a position			1
' others struggle to make ends meet to help people like you , many on minimum wage , ' she said			0
' we have made it possible for you to have this situation			0
' hundreds of viewers contacted the show to join in the debate			0
@entity128 wrote on the @entity130 page : ' if you ca n't afford to have eight children do n't have eight children			1
why should i pay to help you bring up your children when i 'm working hard to look after my own rather than scrounging ? ? ' the family live in a council house and @entity0 admits they 'd ' be lost ' without benefits @entity141 agreed			1
she wrote : ' i work long shifts , weekends and pick up no where near £ 2,000 a month			2
if you want children then why should the tax payers pick up your bill ! ' @entity149 added : ' i 'm a single mum and have worked since my little boy was eight months			0
i only get working tax and child tax credits			0
this pays for nursery fees only			0
i get no other support from the state			0
make me angry as i 'd like to be at home with my little boy but i know that i am giving him the best role model i can be			0
' but others rushed to defend @entity0 saying they felt sorry for her			2
@entity161 said : ' if you think life is better on benefits			0
quit your jobs and try it			0
' it 's not the first time @entity0 has caused controversy by making a tv appearance to air her views on her right to live off benefits			1
in december , she appeared on @entity175 show benefits @entity176 : life on the @entity178 where she admitted she was showering her children with @entity182 gifts rather than using her benefits money to pay the rent			2
she defiantly said : ' a lot of people will see this and once they are all wrapped think " how dare she , she 's on benefits and she has all these presents for her kids and we only have two or three for ours because we are working full time and ca n't afford it "			1
' but everyone deserves a @entity182 and why should we on benefits not be able to ? for my children not to be able to open a present on christmas day because we 're on benefits , it 's just not right , there should n't be a stigma for that			1
' she added : ' if i go back to work doing 12 hours a day it would be positive as i would be at work but the effect on the kids - they would have to go to breakfast club before school , after school club and then not know when i will be home			2
' so is it better to work and neglect the kids or be a stay at home mum till the benefits stop ? ' on today 's @entity12 , @entity0 said she believed her children wo n't grow up to be on benefits like her because she does n't think the welfare system will exist in the future as it does now			1
she admitted she has made a rod for her own back being so brazen about her right to benefits in the press and on tv			0
' i do regret it contacting a paper in the first place , ' she said .			0
