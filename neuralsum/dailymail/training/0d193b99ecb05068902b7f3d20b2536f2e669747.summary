by @entity0 published : 17:29 est , 21 april 2013 updated : 05:09 est , 22 april 2013 a collision between a wheelchair racer and a star woman runner marred the @entity5 ’s elite competitions			2
women ’s pre-race favourite @entity6 , the @entity8 champion , was hit by @entity11 wheelchair racer @entity9 at a drinks station about a third of the way into the race			1
@entity6 , 25 , from @entity16 , ran into the path of @entity9 as the leading wheelchair racers tried to overtake the women ’s pack			1
she carried on running but was unable to make up the ground , finishing 16th			1
after the race @entity9 , who won in @entity37 in 2010 , blamed the collision on the event organisers ’ insistence of the men , women and wheelchair racers finishing in close succession			2
the scheduling means the women set off before the quicker wheelchairs , forcing the wheelchair racers to overtake during the race			0
@entity6 carried on running but was unable to make up the ground , finishing 16th @entity9 , who finished 20th , almost 11 minutes behind winner @entity51 , said the same problems happened year after year @entity9 , who finished 20th , almost 11 minutes behind winner @entity51 , said : ‘ every single year we come to overtake the women , they want to have a staggered start for television so they have the winners one after the other , there ’s ten chairs going at over 20 mph and the poor women are scrambling to find their feet , and sure enough one of them knocked into me			1
@entity9 , 28 , added : ‘ i have a brand new $ 2,000 pair of wheels that are damaged , who ’s going to pay for them ? it ’s really frustrating and it has got to change			0
‘ one of these year one of those women are going to be knocked our unconscious or have their leg broken and their career ruined			0
‘ it ’s just not worth it having this programme set for the finish like this if it ’s going to cause injury or harm			0
