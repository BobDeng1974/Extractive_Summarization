but now she says she breaks down in tears every time she looks in the mirror - and she is even considering launching a legal claim over the £ 120 semi-permanent cosmetic procedure			2
@entity4 is preparing to launch a legal claim and says her tattoo has left her looking ' like a clown ' but the tattooist says the eyebrow inkings - which were discussed with @entity4 - will shrink and fade as the area heals , and the matter has been ' blown out of proportion '			1
the tattoos were done on friday at @entity23 , on @entity24 , @entity25 , as an early @entity27 gift from 18 - year - old daughter @entity28			1
@entity4 had wanted her eyebrows to look more substantial as they were beginning to thin			1
' i had been getting down and my daughter said i should get the tattoo for a @entity27 present , ' she said			1
' the pictures online looked excellent			0
' a consultation cost the family £ 60 before @entity4 went to @entity25 for the procedure on friday			1
