by @entity0 published : 05:02 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 09:37 est , 17 july 2013 not good enough : campaigners say restaurant chains and pubs are still full of burgers , nuggets and sausages most high - street restaurants and pubs still have menus dominated by nuggets , burgers and sausages , a new study has found			1
healthy eating campaigners , the @entity14 , says the industry is still ' churning out the usual suspects ' and must improve standards if @entity18 is to win the battle against increasing childhood obesity			1
an investigation found eight out of 21 restaurants did not have any vegetables or salad in their children 's menus and 11 did not have any fruit on offer as a children 's dessert			1
the charity also ranked the chains based on their nutritional standards , sourcing policies , children 's facilities and the experiences of 40 families who visited them over a period of three months			1
@entity42 's @entity41 was ranked top of the list alongside @entity45 's and @entity46 while @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 were the three lowest			1
but overall , 12 out of 21 restaurants have menus filled with nuggets , burgers and sausages			1
and 66 per cent of parents think food provision for children in restaurants is not good enough			1
in another worrying find in the wake of the horsemeat scandal , only one restaurant , @entity42 's @entity41 , could reliably tell secret diners where their meat had come from			1
study : the table was based on nutritional standards , sourcing policies , children 's facilities and the experience of 40 mystery diners @entity71 , who launched @entity42 ’s @entity41 in 2008 , said : ' since the first @entity42 ’s @entity41 opened we ’ve always kept things kid - friendly with our funky viewfinder menus and super-tasty food , so to come top of the table is a fantastic achievement , and more importantly , confirmation that we 're doing things right			1
' we believe that the quality of the kids ’ food should to be right up there on the same level as the main menu , and i truly believe that we have a brilliant offering that both kids love and parents can trust			2
' over the years , i ’ve learnt that if you give kids a bit of ownership over their food , they ’ll really embrace it , so that 's exactly what we ’ve done with our “ shake me ” salads			1
every dish on the kid 's menu comes with one and it counts as one of a child ’s five a day			2
i ’ve seen parents completely amazed that their kids are eating salad , and that 's down to the fact that they ’ve been involved and had fun putting it together			2
' @entity113 rated : a survey based on the experiences of 40 families rated @entity42 's @entity41 , pictured , as the best for children 's food @entity47 , which admitted that some of its burgers contained contaminated meat earlier this year , came bottom of the list			1
a spokesman said : ' at @entity127 we are committed to offering a welcoming environment for families in our restaurants , and to providing parents with a range of options to allow them to make healthy choices for their children			1
' this includes offering them apple fries , milk , water or juice in our kids ’ meals			0
our sourcing policy is rooted in ingredients that deliver the best quality , freshness and taste for our food , with more than two thirds of our products locally sourced			0
pleased : chef @entity71 said coming top of the league table was a ' fantastic achievement ' @entity71 , the world 's richest chef , has been campaigning for almost a decade to improve the diet of @entity18 's children			2
back in 2007 , he helped push through a minimum nutritional standard for state school meals on the back of his television series @entity164			0
the father - of - four went into school canteens and encouraged cooks to drop fatty foods of their menus in favour of healthier options			0
sweets , fizzy drinks and crisped were taken out of vending machines			0
some children complained and took to bringing in crisps and chocolate to sell to their classmates , but studies have shown may have led to improved exam results			0
scrapping junk food in primary schools led to a 4.5 per cent boost in @entity184 results the schools where the scheme was first tried			0
and take up of school meals has steadily increased with two - thirds of primary school children and a third of high school children now opting to eat them			0
but @entity71 has recently criticised education secretary @entity192 , accusing him of undoing the good work after his controversial decision to allow academies to be exempt from minimum nutritional standards			0
' @entity127 is committed to working collaboratively with @entity197 , industry and the public health community			0
' the ranking of @entity46 in third place may raise a few eyebrows , but food development manager @entity203 said it is not surprising			0
' we are very pleased to be recognised for the work we have undertaken on our children ’s menu			0
' @entity46 serves more than two million children ’s meals each year across our pubs and appreciate the importance of sourcing @entity18 ingredients and offering balanced meals			0
' we know that there is still more work to do to enhance the menu further , including offering varying portion sizes and we will be working towards this			0
' bottom of the class : @entity47 was the lowest - rated restaurant for the quality of its food provision for children the @entity226 campaign , launched by the @entity14 and organic baby food brand @entity228 , is calling on all restaurants to improve standards by offering the choice of a children 's portion of adult meals among other demands			1
@entity237 , from the @entity14 , said : ' our investigation reveals that most high street restaurants are not even meeting the most basic standards families should expect when they eat out			0
' most are still churning out children ’s menus dominated by the usual suspects – burgers , nuggets and pizzas – turning the table into a battlefield for any parents wanting their child to eat well			1
' with one in three children now overweight or obese by the time they leave primary school , it ’s time for these popular chains to use their influence in a positive way			2
' restaurants need to raise the bar and listen to parents who are saying they want fresh food not ready meals for their children , and the same kind of variety you ’d expect as an adult			1
' @entity270 , from @entity228 , an organic baby food brand which co-authored the research , said the best way for families to force restaurants to improve standards is to ' vote with their feet '			2
she said : ' four out of ten parents told us they eat out once a fortnight or more with their families			0
if restaurants and pubs want to ensure business stays strong and see customers return , they need to start improving what they ’re serving to children			2

more than half of most popular restaurants serve only ' usual suspects '
study found 12 of 21 menus filled with nuggets , burgers and sausages
@entity42 's @entity41 rated highest for food provision for children
@entity47 ranked bottom with score of only 10 out of *80*
