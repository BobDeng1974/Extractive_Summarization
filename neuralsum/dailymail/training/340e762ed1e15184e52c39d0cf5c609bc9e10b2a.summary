by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:54 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 11:34 est , 30 january 2013 cabinet minister @entity2 will today urge @entity3 to focus on the ' positives ' of @entity5 staying in the @entity6 as he helps launch a campaign to keep @entity8 in the @entity6			1
the former chancellor will be joined by @entity11 treasury minister @entity10 and @entity13 's @entity12 to front a ‘ patriotic fightback ’ against euroscepticism			1
mr @entity2 will defy @entity17 sentiment in his party to insist the pm must ' concentrate on what we are in favour of and not just what we are against ' while mr @entity10 will dismiss calls to withdraw from much of the @entity6 as ' nonsensical '			1
@entity26 @entity25 @entity2 will join @entity11 treasury minister @entity10 at the launch of the @entity28 for @entity8 influence the two coalition cabinet minister pair will be joined by former labour minister @entity12 , a one - time @entity6 trade commissioner , at the launch of @entity28 for @entity8 influence in @entity32			1
in a provocative move the launch of the @entity35 campaign to keep @entity8 in the @entity6 is being held in the @entity38 ’s building in @entity40 ’s @entity39 which used to be occupied by the @entity25			1
mr @entity2 will use a speech at tonight 's launch to urge ' strong support for a better @entity6 within which @entity8 can exert power and influence in the modern world '			1
addressing an audience of 200 people from the worlds of politics , the media , business , diplomacy , trade unions and think tanks , he will say it is ' obvious ' and ' essential ' that the @entity6 needs to reform in order for the @entity8 to ' compete properly in a fiercely global marketplace '			2
' the real challenge for us as we debate our role in the @entity6 is working out what we should be pushing forward , what we should be leading on within the @entity6 , to make it - and us - a more effective economic and global power , ' he will add			1
' we need to concentrate on what we are in favour of and not just what we are against			0
there is a huge potential prize out there for the @entity8 if only we focus our attention and influence in any future negotiations on the positive things that really matter			0
' the fact is , that we are immensely powerful as part of a market of 500 million people			0
' mr @entity2 , a minister without portfolio , is the most senior @entity25 figure to throw his weight behind the campaign against leaving the @entity6			1
as the prime minister 's special representative on @entity6 - @entity85 trade talks with a roving brief across @entity87 he remains one of the most well - known figures on the @entity25 frontbench			1
but his @entity26 opinions are sharply at odds with much of the rest of the @entity94			0
@entity25 party chairman @entity96 and @entity40 mayor @entity97 have both suggested they could vote to quit if @entity8 can not get a better deal from @entity5			1
@entity11 treasury minister @entity10 will warn of the economic dangers of leaving @entity5 in a move likely to rile @entity25 eurosceptics , the two government ministers will share a platform with @entity12 , who will insist anti-eu claims ' can not go unchallenged anymore '			1
@entity12 will say : ' i do not regard today 's event as firing the starting pistol for a referendum campaign because there is a lot of water to flow under the bridge – including the holding of a general election – before any point of decision is reached on that			0
' but the point is , for far too long , those who want to destroy @entity8 's interests and influence in @entity32 have been allowed to get away with murder with the lies and false propaganda they have poured out about the @entity6 and what it represents for our country			1
this can not go unchallenged anymore			2
' the pro @entity32 have bided their time			0
now we must unbide our time			0
' my complaint is that , often in @entity8 , we do not stand up for ourselves in @entity32 nearly as vigorously and effectively as we should			0
' instead of heading up a cul de sac of mindless , inward looking , soul searching and navel gazing , we should be going out and spreading our influence and fighting for the agenda we think is good for @entity8 and for @entity32 as a whole			0
' mr @entity10 , who before entering @entity142 worked for campaign group @entity143 , will argue that @entity8 has a more powerful negotiating role ' inside @entity32 than from the sidelines '			1
' the @entity6 is not perfect by any stretch and i ’m a big advocate of @entity6 reform			0
' but the idea that we should extract ourselves from the bulk of @entity6 obligations is nonsensical			0
' we can offer a more compelling alternative : a strong @entity8 , influential in @entity32 and so more influential in the world			0
stronger with @entity85 and @entity154 , because we are at the heart of the @entity6			0
' @entity3 used a speech on @entity6 and @entity8 's role in it to promise to give @entity8 a straight referendum choice on whether to stay or leave it comes as mps debate @entity3 's landmark pledge of an in - out referendum by 2017			1
@entity3 used his long - awaited speech on @entity32 last week to promise a referendum on leaving the @entity6 by 2017			1
the prime minister said the @entity166 will promise at the next election to renegotiate @entity8 ’s @entity6 membership , before putting the ‘ fresh settlement ’ to a straight in - out vote			1
he said : ' ‘ you will have an important choice to make about our country ’s destiny			0
’ organisers of the new @entity179 campaign say they want to challenge misconceptions the @entity8 public hold about @entity32 , including fears that it costs up to a quarter of the nation ’s economy while wielding little or no influence in @entity5			1
it will publish an annual @entity6 power league , to show how the @entity8 benefits from continued membership			2
@entity190 , director of the @entity191 , will say : ' we are assembling an army of supporters to fight @entity195 and promote a reform and growth agenda that serves the @entity8 national interest			0
many @entity8 people think their country is powerless in @entity32			0
' this is fundamentally wrong and unpatriotic			0
@entity8 helped create modern @entity32 , our allies want us in and it is time we finished the job			0
' details of the launch came as @entity207 yesterday condemned plans for an in - out referendum and said @entity13 should make the case for staying in because it will rebuild the party ’s relations with business leaders			2
the former prime minister told the @entity216 magazine @entity215 : ‘ i have difficulties with the notion that we commit now to putting a referendum question with an out option			2
‘ if you believe as i believe that @entity8 leaving @entity32 would be very bad for @entity8 , then it ’s a threat that is to do yourself damage			2
former prime minister @entity207 said leaving the @entity6 would be ' very bad ' for @entity8 ‘ it is not good for @entity8 , never mind if it ’s good for @entity32 , for us to question our membership in the @entity6 -- and then leave that question hanging there for what could be four or five years			1
’ he added : ‘ @entity13 should argue unequivocally for @entity8 to stay , it will help the party to build bridges to the business community , which is important			0
’ mr @entity3 won the support of 18 member states for a plan to reform the @entity6 and the single market , which the new campaign backs			2
the pm has insisted he will vote with his ‘ heart and soul ’ to keep @entity8 in the @entity6 if he gets a better deal			2
but the polls are split on whether voters would choose to stay in or sever all ties with @entity5			0
the @entity8 @entity246 has seen its popularity soar in recent months			0
@entity25 chancellor @entity248 has made clear his intention to make the @entity6 referendum a key dividing line at the 2015 general election			2
he claimed @entity13 and the @entity11 ‘ do not trust ’ the @entity8 people with having a say on @entity32			2
today it was claimed @entity13 leader @entity255 had been talked out of promising an in - out referendum by his brother @entity257 , a former foreign secretary			1
a senior @entity13 figure claimed @entity255 vetoed the idea after @entity257 said it was ' too populist ' , @entity258 reported			2
however , @entity13 's policy chief @entity262 has long - argued for a referendum and is pushing @entity255 to change his mind .			1
