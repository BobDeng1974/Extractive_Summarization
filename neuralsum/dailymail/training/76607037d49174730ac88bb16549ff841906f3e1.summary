@entity0 has launched an urgent investigation after a man passed through to the departure lounge without a ticket			1
the man , believed to be a @entity6 national , managed to pass through the security area and reach the departure lounge at around 8.20am this morning , despite not having a boarding pass			1
the incident comes less than a week after it was revealed that security checks were being enhanced at airports with uncharged electronic devices being refused access			1
security breach : a man got airside at @entity0 this morning despite not having a boarding pass it is believed that the man was not intending to travel , but wanted to see his family off			1
they passed through a buggy lane – but security staff failed to tally the number of boarding passes with the number of people coming through			1
they then passed successfully through the airport ’s scanning procedures and into the departure lounge			0
shopped : a retail unit asked the man for his boarding pass and alerted security teams when he failed to produce one airport security staff were alerted to the breach by a retail unit , which as a matter of course had asked the man for a boarding pass when he tried to make a purchase			1
one source told @entity44 : ‘ a @entity6 man managed to walk straight through customs to departures - and he had no tickets			2
he managed to get airside			0
‘ it ’s a huge breach of security but staff have been told not to talk about it and not to tell anyone			1
i think it ’s appalling			0
‘ how did he get through ? he was with his wife and came through the buggy and family track			2
security are playing it down and saying it ’s no big deal but it is			0
’ a @entity0 spokesperson said : ‘ earlier this morning a gentleman accompanying his family through the airport was incorrectly allowed access to the departure lounge without having a boarding pass			1
‘ the incident is being investigated but all individuals correctly passed through the series of full security search and screen processes			2
’ the electronic device checks introduced by the @entity75 last week will not affect all @entity77 passengers			0
although they have refused to make public the routes affected , ministers have provided a list of flights they consider require additional security checks			0
it is understood this includes flights to and from the @entity86 , @entity87 and parts of southern @entity89			0
if your flight is hit by additional security checks , it is unlikely you will know much about until you reach the boarding gate			2
arriving at the airport , passengers will check - in their hold luggage and pass through body and bag scanners into the departure lounge in the usual way			2
this will include ensuring all electronic devices being taken on board the flight - such as cameras and laptops - are packed away inside hand luggage bags			0
passengers are likely to expect extra checks if they are called to the departure gate earlier than usual			0
this is to allow for the extra time it takes security staff to check every electronic device is working properly			1
the @entity75 says all passengers arriving or leaving the @entity77 must prepare for the special measures			0
the teams working on the checks will have been hired by the airlines themselves , not by the airport , but the @entity75 has insisted all will be fully qualified security staff			1
if , for whatever reason , your device fails the security check , you will be forced to leave your device behind , and may even be banned from taking the flight itself .			0
