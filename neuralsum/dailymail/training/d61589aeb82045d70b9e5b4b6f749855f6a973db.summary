the campaign sees her posed alongside visual artist @entity14 in a denim dress , bright red lipstick and her signature platinum blonde hair , making it clear how mr @entity18 consciously decided to feature , rather than hide her electric wheelchair in the photo			0
cover girl : @entity6 ( right ) , a 26 - year - old fashion editor , stars in @entity1 's new spring campaign she told @entity25 that she hopes the ad ‘ gives hope to people who are maybe saying , “ my life is over ” because they are disabled			1
you can totally do it , nothing should be stopping you			0
’ the campaign - photographed by the acclaimed duo @entity34 and @entity35 - will run in the march issues of magazines including @entity38 and @entity39 , and will also be displayed on the walls of every single @entity1 store worldwide			1
miss @entity6 first met mr @entity18 through a shoot produced by we the @entity44 , where she works as the executive editorial director			1
a few months later , she saw that his assistant put out a casting call for young , culturally - representative models to join @entity1 as a campaign ambassador			1
miss @entity6 and her friends decided to enter the lot as a ‘ joke ’ she said			1
model citizen : miss @entity6 says that those in similar physical situations should not let their disabilities affect their success and dreams but then , ‘ a few weeks later i got an email from the casting agency that said “ hey can you send us more pictures ? we are kind of interested in having you in the campaign			1
” ’ out of disbelief , miss @entity6 responded with an assortment of @entity69 and @entity70 photos			2
following a few days of deliberation , she was chosen to star in the campaign among 23 tastemakers hailing from her own generation			0
' you do n’t have to be a conventional model type to represent a brand ' miss @entity6 was not aware when the campaign would become public and on tuesday morning woke up to see that mr @entity18 had ‘ tagged ’ her in a photo on @entity70 , signaling the campaign ’s surprise release			1
in an interview with @entity83 , mr @entity18 indicated that miss @entity6 was his favorite cast member of the campaign ’s total 23 participants , who were picked to represent different sects of youth culture ( including @entity89 internet stars and tattooed models )			1
‘ it ’s never easy for her to move from point a to point b , but she ’s totally fearless and has really been an inspiration to me , ’ he told the paper			0
‘ you do n’t have to be a conventional model type to represent a brand			2
’ street style : miss @entity6 is often photographed at fashion events for her bold style miss @entity6 admitted that she ‘ always gets scared [ of the public ’s reaction to her disability ]			2
you never know , there are a lot of people who hate , or a lot of people who are not comfortable with the situation			0
‘ i always have it in the back of my mind “ do n’t be surprised if someone hates on the photo			0
” ’ but when mr @entity18 released her image on his @entity70 feed yesterday morning , the overall response ‘ was completely amazing , ’ she told us			0
miss @entity6 thinks that mr @entity18 ’s decision to use her in the campaign represents something ‘ so much bigger than just an ad			2
‘ drawing on her own experiences , miss @entity6 said ‘ i know some people look at me and say “ oh wow , i ca n’t believe you ’re doing this ” and in my head i think , “ why do n’t you believe me ? ” i went to college , i did what everyone else did to follow their dreams			2
’ fellow stars : miss @entity6 stars alongside @entity89 internet stars @entity135 and @entity136 tattoo fringe : heavily - tattooed models @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 also take a starring role in the campaign in fact , miss @entity6 did that ten-fold			1
this writer attended college with miss @entity6 at the @entity148 and for 4 years watched her commute to the school ’s downtown @entity151 campus via a grueling series of multiple bus and subway transfers , as the city ’s mass - transit system is not fully wheelchair accessible			2
rather than appearing discouraged or frustrated , one could say that miss @entity6 came off as decidedly more cheerful , driven , and pleasant than the school ’s average student			0
during her time in college , miss @entity6 completed internships at @entity162 , @entity163 , and with the society photographer @entity165 – establishments that all embraced her disability			0
miss @entity6 says that there is no reason for people in similar physical situations not to pursue their dreams			0
‘ maybe their family does n’t want them to pursue something because they do n’t want them to get hurt , and yeah , you will get hurt , i wo n’t lie to you			0
it just depends on how badly you want it			0
’ @entity1 's spring advertisements mark mr @entity18 ’s second commercial outing for the brand			1
fashion education : miss @entity6 studied at the @entity148 and interned at @entity187 as well as with society photographer @entity165 he was appointed as the struggling label ’s artistic director last year after holding a similar position within the @entity192 house of @entity193			1
mr @entity18 has aptly named his outlook for @entity1 as a ‘ reboot ’ , and is working to target denim - loving millennials through a series of tactful marketing schemes – much of which has relied on his strong social media presence			0
miss @entity6 thinks that her feature in this new campaign is effective in how it shows that ‘ anyone can wear @entity207 – you do n’t have to be a supermodel , you do n’t have to be a millionaire , you can wear it no matter who you are and what you look like			0

@entity1 artistic director @entity0 said that @entity6 is his favorite participant in the brand 's spring advertisements
