@entity0 has gained a fiancee but lost two of his key lieutenants with his life set to change on different fronts			0
before it emerged that he was engaged to long - time girlfriend @entity7 , he announced a distinctly inharmonious separation from two other constants in his life over recent years — assistant coach @entity11 and fitness trainer @entity12			1
decidedly less romantic it may be , but the latter development will have more immediate impact on a career that the @entity17 hopes still has five seasons to run			0
@entity0 ( centre ) , pictured with mother @entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 ( second right ) in 2012 , has split with longstanding assistant coach @entity11 ( second left ) and physical trainer @entity12 ( right ) the @entity17 suffered a dreadful finish match of the season as he was smashed by @entity25 @entity0 's decision to bring in @entity27 as his coach is said to have brought about tensions the departure of @entity11 and @entity12 distances him further from the glory of the @entity33 era and cements his relationship with @entity27			1
@entity33 , who guided @entity0 to the @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity38 titles , last night told @entity39 : ‘ as you know , i think very highly of @entity11 and @entity12 and their work			1
’ with their exit , officially described as ‘ mutual ’ but inevitably more complicated than that , the 27 - year - old @entity17 has reaffirmed his faith in @entity27			1
a brief statement brought to an end @entity11 ’s five and @entity12 ’s seven years of solid service			2
‘ we sat down at the end of the season and decided a change would be best for all of us , ’ said @entity0 , who flew yesterday to @entity50 to begin his lucrative stint in the inaugural @entity52			0
‘ my off - season training and @entity59 preparations have already begun and i am very excited for the new year			0
i thank @entity12 and @entity11 for all their hard work over the years and wish them the best for the future			2
’ @entity65 ( right ) chats to @entity0 during a training session at @entity67 in @entity68 in june 2012 @entity0 plays a shot during his match with @entity71 of @entity72 during the @entity73 @entity12 ( front row , second right ) and @entity65 ( second left , front row ) watch @entity0 in 2012 that may be true as far as it goes , but the reasons behind the split lie in the growing influence of @entity27 and the differences of opinion in the camp that have developed since her arrival			1
it is known that @entity0 ’s long - time friend @entity65 has not enjoyed working with the 35 - year - old @entity88			1
both @entity11 and @entity12 only discovered that @entity27 ’s appointment was on the cards when they read @entity39 ’s exclusive revelation during the @entity93 that the groundbreaking move was imminent			1
their upset at being kept out of the loop became more clear after @entity0 lost in this summer ’s @entity36 quarter - final , although things appeared to have settled down thereafter			0
in recent weeks when he went on a tear through @entity101 and @entity102 to qualify for the @entity103 , @entity0 went out of his way to give credit to @entity65 ( the @entity106 was there through @entity101 , while @entity27 was absent )			2
but after @entity0 ’s 6 - 0 , 6 - 1 defeat by @entity25 in the @entity73 , @entity65 is said to have made it clear he was unhappy			2
he had been in charge since @entity33 walked out in march and was effectively demoted when @entity27 came on board			0
@entity33 ( centre ) , @entity12 and @entity11 were all key to @entity0 's success in the majors and @entity38 @entity0 has always been ruthless when making coaching changes			1
in his senior career he has gone through @entity117 , @entity119 @entity118 , @entity120 and former @entity122 star @entity121			0
@entity0 and @entity12 are said to have disagreed about training			2
@entity12 wanted to stick with the uncompromising routines of old that turned @entity0 into a super-athlete , while the player is said to favour a more nuanced approach as he heads into his late twenties			2
i understand that the trainer recently undertook some work with the hugely promising 17 - year - old @entity134 @entity133 , and that has also been a source of friction between the pair			1
while @entity0 is now set to work more full time with his @entity141 - based trainer , @entity140 , he is likely to bring in a replacement for @entity65 to work under @entity27			1
@entity25 ( left ) talks to @entity0 during a match at the @entity59 in january 2013 many former top players are privately sceptical about whether she can take him on ( but anxious about saying it publicly for fear of being accused of sexism )			0
in the final analysis , to finish ranked sixth in a season returning from back surgery is a fine effort , but since he and @entity27 teamed up the only sign of his @entity36 - winning form has come in the first two sets of the @entity35 quarter - final against @entity158			0
otherwise @entity0 has had to rely on his fighting instincts to beat lesser players and scoop his three @entity73 titles since late september			0
he insists that only next season can the partnership be judged , and @entity27 will have to instil in him a more dynamic and aggressive style if he is to seriously challenge the top three once again .			0

@entity0 has made some changes to his *backroom* staff
@entity17 has *dispensed* of services of assistant coach @entity11
physical trainer @entity12 will also leave the 27 - year - old 's staff
@entity11 had been with @entity0 for fives years and @entity12 seven
a rift is said to have arisen after @entity27 became @entity0 's coach
