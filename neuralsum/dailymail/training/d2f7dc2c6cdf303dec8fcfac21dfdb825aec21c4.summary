by @entity0 published : 09:57 est , 5 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:57 est , 5 december 2013 a @entity4 teen has had a lucky escape after accidentally swallowing two buckminsterfullerenes or ' @entity7 ' - rare - earth magnets that are incredibly strong and can perforate the stomach and even kill if swallowed			1
@entity10 , 14 , was given six of the magnets by a church friend just before @entity14 , and took them to her school in @entity16 to ' freak out ' her friends with tricks such as pulling a pen up a wall from a neighboring classroom			2
but the fun ended when @entity10 accidentally swallowed the magnets and had to have them surgically removed along with a portion of her colon and her appendix			1
life - saving surgery : doctors removed rare - earth magnets from @entity10 ' small intestine after she accidentally swallowed two @entity7 buckyballs come in a set of 216 magnets that can be manipulated into sculptures and chain jewelry			1
@entity10 says swallowing the tiny , spherical magnets was ' one of those stupid moments			2
' ' i was going to the bathroom and i put them in my mouth because i did n't want to put them on the floor			0
i was n't quite thinking			0
the kid on the other side said something that made me laugh and swallow them , ' she told @entity51			0
' i started to try to make myself throw up because i read they were really dangerous and got really worried , ' she said			0
' i told my teacher , and she sent me to the clinic and they called my mom			0
' @entity10 ' mother , @entity57 , did some research on the internet and realized that her daughter 's condition was life - threatening			2
she rushed her to the emergency room where doctors told her to go home and wait until her daughter passed the magnets			1
not a toy : magnet - related emergency room visits have increased five times since 2002 , and been linked with one death not content with this solution , @entity57 sought a second opinion and christin was sent to @entity74			1
' she came in overnight feeling fine , and in the morning when we repeated her x-ray we saw what looked like two round magnets and they had passed into the stomach , ' dr @entity75 , her gastroenterologist , told @entity51			0
irresistible : the tiny magnets have proven tempting for children and kids swallowing them or putting them up their noses has resulted in a huge increase in magnet - related injuries ' we thought we could do an upper endoscopy and be done with it			1
by the third day , the magnets had become stuck at the end of @entity10 's small intestine , risking perforation and infection of the tissue			1
the buckyballs @entity10 swallowed were made of neodymium , a material that begins to chip and erode in stomach acid			2
the risk becomes even more extreme if more than one magnet is swallowed , because if they become separated they can twist parts of the intestine and stomach between them , cutting off blood supply			2
after five days in hospital , @entity10 was finally released and her mother says she is ' doing well			0
' @entity57 and @entity10 are hoping to draw attention ot the dangers of the tiny magnets - particularly if swallowed by a small child who ca n't communicate the information to parents			1
' they are very dangerous unless they are used for the right things , ' @entity10 told @entity51			2
' i wanted to make people more aware of this before @entity124 when younger children can get ahold of the stuff			0
there is a 60 per cent morbidity			0
a little kid would n't survive			0
' rare - earth magnets pose ' unique health hazards to children , ' according to the @entity133			1
since 2003 , one death and 19 injuries , often requiring gastrointestinal surgery , have been reported and between 2002 and 2011 , magnet - related emergency room visits among people under 21 incerased five fold - a total of 22,500 cases			1
hospital stay : doctors at @entity74 ( pictured ) in @entity144 , @entity4 , had to perform surgery on @entity10 when the magnets became stuck in her small intestine @entity57 would like to see the tiny magnets completely banned			1
in 2012 , the @entity150 @entity149 ( @entity149 ) started a product recall proceeding against the former ceo of @entity153 & @entity154 , the company that makes @entity7 , linking them to 1,700 emergency room visits from 2009 to 2011			1
according to @entity157 , in february this year the @entity149 invoked a little - used legal doctrine to attempt to force @entity159 , the former ceo of @entity160 and @entity154 , to pay an estimated $ 57 million in costs related to the recall			0
last month , @entity159 filed a lawsuit asking the @entity164 of @entity165 to block the @entity149 from seeking damages against him personally .			0
