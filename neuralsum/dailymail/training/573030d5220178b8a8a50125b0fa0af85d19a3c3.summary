by @entity1 reporter published : 19:58 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 08:38 est , 7 november 2012 @entity3 @entity2 paid for his ' legitimate rape ' remarks , losing last night to @entity8 @entity7 senator @entity6			1
though @entity6 was considered the most vulnerable incumbent , @entity2 severely damaged his candidacy in august when he said women 's bodies have ways of avoiding pregnancy in ' legitimate rape			1
' he deeply hurt his campaign after saying on a @entity18 television show this fall : ' if it 's a legitimate rape , the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down			2
in his concession speech , @entity2 compared himself to people who have suffered from cancer , saying people like him ' suffer of cancer , loss of a job , house , loved ones and they press on			1

when called , they 'll risk their lives for their country or their community , but they do n't think of themselves as particularly special			0
they do n't look to government for special deals , but they do think that the government should respect our hard - earned tax dollars that it collects			2
in short , they love @entity51 , they love their families and they love our country			0
' @entity2 added , ' you know , we believe that life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness come from almighty @entity51 , not an almighty government ... and we believe that the @entity86 is not a list of suggestions			1
' meanwhile , @entity42 's @entity3 senate hopeful @entity44 lost to @entity90 @entity43 , following his ill - received comments that pregnancy from rape is ' something @entity51 intended			1
' in @entity42 , @entity8 rep. @entity43 triumphed over tea party - backed state treasurer @entity44 , whose own clumsy comment about rape and abortion in the closing days of the race damaged his chances of securing the much - coveted seat			1
with 61 percent of the vote , @entity43 was ahead by about 3,000 votes			1
@entity8 candidates grabbed the lead in two @entity3 - held @entity35 seats in @entity107 and @entity42 on tuesday , complicating the @entity3 's drive to seize control of the @entity35			1
@entity110 won the @entity3 @entity35 seat in @entity112 to add a dose of uncertainty to the fierce fight for the majority			1
democrat @entity117 held the edge in @entity107 over @entity3 sen. @entity119 , who stunned the political world in january 2010 when he won sen. @entity122 's seat			1
with 29 percent of the vote , @entity123 held a 52 - 47 percent edge			1
republicans set their sights on three @entity8 - held seats - @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity28			2

the @entity145 called the race based on interviews with voters as they left polling stations			0
in @entity151 , @entity8 sen. @entity150 survived an onslaught of outside spending , some $ 30 million , to defeat state treasurer @entity154			0
in @entity156 , @entity8 sen. @entity155 survived a late scare from businessman @entity158 , who invested more than $ 17 million of his money			0
@entity8 rep. @entity133 won the @entity136 seat held by sen. @entity137 , the independent who was the @entity8 's vice presidential nominee in 2000			0
@entity133 's win marked the second straight defeat for former wrestling executive @entity134 , who spent $ 50 million of her own wealth in a failed effort against sen. @entity165 in 2010 and more than $ 42 million this election cycle			0
@entity167 sent tea party - backed @entity168 to the @entity35 as the @entity3 won the seat held by retiring @entity3 sen. @entity171			1
wave : @entity8 candidate for @entity174 @entity117 waves to supporters before voting today controversy : @entity35 candidate , rep. @entity2 , left , and @entity179 candidate @entity44 , right , both @entity3 , have come under fire for their comments over rape in @entity184 , @entity8 sen. @entity183 triumphed in his bid for a third term , holding off a challenge from @entity188 rep. @entity188			1
@entity3 groups had spent heavily against @entity183 early in the race , but the moderate @entity90 was a prolific fundraiser with wide appeal among @entity8 and some @entity3 in the @entity193			1
independent sen. @entity194 won a second term in @entity196			0
@entity8 sens. @entity197 in @entity198 , @entity199 in @entity200 and @entity201 in @entity202 were all re-elected			0

polling : @entity8 candidate for @entity45 @entity133 votes while holding son rider in @entity218 , @entity219 today voting day pass time : @entity8 senate candidate @entity221 tends to his rose garden outside of his @entity223 , @entity224 home today informed : sen. @entity155 , @entity156 , watches the news in his upstairs office at his home in @entity229 today @entity230 gave @entity3 sen. @entity231 a second term			1
@entity234 voters did the same for sen. @entity235 , and @entity3 @entity236 captured another term in @entity224			2
win : @entity110 , an independent , has won the @entity35 race in @entity112 former gov. @entity110 has won the @entity35 race in @entity112 , running as an independent			0

@entity3 sen. @entity231 was re-elected in @entity243			2
@entity110 has n't said which party he will caucus with , but @entity3 groups have spent millions of dollars opposing his candidacy			2
@entity110 has resolutely refused to say which party he 'd side with if elected , and the outcome of the presidential election and the final @entity35 lineup could influence his decision			0
members of both parties have indicated that they expect @entity110 - former governor and one - time @entity90 who supports president @entity255 - to align with @entity8			2
one factor could be the million - plus dollars that @entity3 - leaning groups such as the @entity27 @entity258 and @entity260 's organization spent on ads criticizing @entity110			1
@entity8 currently hold a 53 - 47 edge in the @entity35 , including the two independents who caucus with them			0
@entity3 need a net of four seats to grab the majority , three if @entity3 @entity215 wins the presidency			2
the caustic campaign for control of the @entity35 in a divided @entity270 was marked by endless negative ads and more than $ 1 billion in spending by outside groups on races from @entity28 to @entity275 , @entity184 to @entity276			0
the outcome in @entity151 and @entity28 was closely linked to the presidential race			0
republicans and @entity8 in @entity107 , @entity129 and @entity275 hoped that energetic campaigns and personality would lead to ticket - splitting by voters			0
republicans were on the defensive in @entity42 , where tea party - backed state treasurer @entity44 was locked in a close race with @entity8 rep. @entity43			1
with 50 percent of the vote , @entity43 held a narrow lead , 48 percent to 46 percent			2
libertarian @entity290 , a potential factor in the final results , grabbed the remainder			0
vote : @entity2 , right , voting early on tuesday morning ; @entity2 is running against @entity8 incumbent @entity6 for the @entity45 in a race that has drawn national attention @entity297 : a volunteer carries a sign into @entity45 candidate @entity44 's ( r - in ) victory rally in @entity302 , @entity42 @entity44 had been considered the favorite after knocking out six - term sen. @entity304 in the @entity3 primary in may			1
but he damaged his chances when he said in a debate that pregnancy resulting from rape is ‘ something @entity51 intended			0
’ @entity3 sen. @entity119 , who stunned @entity8 in january 2010 by capturing sen. @entity122 's @entity107 seat , was the underdog against @entity90 @entity117 in one of the nation 's costliest races			2
the two candidates agreed to no outside money by super pacs and other independent groups then together spent $ 68 million on their campaign			0
the arithmetic was daunting for @entity8 at the start of the election cycle - they had to defend 23 seats to the @entity3 's 10			1
further complicating the calculation were @entity8 retirements in @entity28 , @entity327 , @entity129 , @entity328 , @entity128 and @entity276 as well as the retirement of @entity137			0
republicans had to deal with retirements in @entity332 , @entity167 and @entity112			0
@entity3 hopes of reclaiming the @entity35 suffered a major blow when the @entity3 candidate in @entity7 made awkward remarks about rape and abortion			1
democrats and @entity3 in a dozen states faced an onslaught of outside money that financed endless negative commercials and ugly mailings that left voters exasperated			2
the record independent spending - $ 50 million in @entity28 and $ 40 million in @entity327 in addition to $ 33 million in @entity151 - reflected the high - stakes fight for the @entity35			0
incumbent : senator @entity206 of @entity207 is the projected winner of the state video : @entity44 's gaff ... and likely the reason he lost the election ...			1

@entity2 of @entity7 takes only 39 percent of the vote
compares himself to cancer victim in concession speech
@entity179 hopeful @entity44 , a @entity3 , lost following his own ill - received rape comment
