prostate cancer resistant to conventional treatment could be all but wiped out by a therapy that boosts the immune system , claim researchers			2
tests carried out in combination with chemotherapy drugs achieved almost complete remission in mice			0
the @entity11 scientists used low doses of the drug oxaliplatin , which has a unique ability to activate cancer - killing immune cells in small tumours but works less well in large , aggressive tumours			1
tests of new drug oxaliplatin , carried out in combination with chemotherapy drugs , achieved almost complete remission in mice			2
each year in the @entity22 around 41,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer and 11,000 die from the disease the problem is partly caused by immune system ‘ b - cells ’ that put a brake on the body ’s defences in prostate and other cancers			1
in their study , the researchers found a way of blocking the development or function of these b - cells , or removed them entirely before using oxaliplatin			2
the prostate tumours were ‘ almost completely destroyed ’ by the mice ’s own immune cells , the team said			1
lead scientist @entity45 , of the @entity46 , said : ‘ the presence of such b - cells in human prostate cancer calls for clinical testing of this novel therapeutic approach			1
’ because of the effect of the immune system , advanced and aggressive prostate cancer does not typically respond to chemotherapy , researchers said			1
b - cells also undermine the effectiveness of promising new drugs called checkpoint inhibitors which ‘ unmask ’ cancer cells allowing them to be recognised by the immune system			1
there are currently few options for men with aggressive drug - resistant prostate cancer that has started to spread but researchers also managed to get a checkpoint inhibitor – combined with chemotherapy – to work after wiping out the b - cells in one test			1
each year in the @entity22 around 41,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer and 11,000 die from the disease			0
while early treatment is often highly successful , there are few options for men with aggressive drug - resistant prostate cancer that has started to spread			1
b - cells play a number of vital immune system roles , including the production of antibodies			2
they can also tell the immune system to slow down when it is getting overheated , but this can be counter-productive in cancer treatment			0
professor @entity88 , study co-author and also from the @entity46 , said there might be implications for the treatment of other types of cancer			0
the @entity94 designed @entity95 at the @entity46			0
researchers there have made this new prostate cancer breakthrough ‘ similar immunosuppressive b - cells can be detected in other human cancers , ’ he added			1
‘ this indicates that b - cell - mediated immunosuppression might be the reason several other cancers are also unresponsive to checkpoint inhibitors , raising the hope that chemoimmunotherapy will have broader applications for many cancer types			0
’ symptoms of prostate cancer include the need to urinate more frequently , especially at night , painful ejaculation and blood in the urine or semen			2
men may also have pain or stiffness in the lower back , hips or thighs			0
however , not all men with the disease will have symptoms and often the cancer is spotted only in a routine check - up			0
early diagnosis is crucial – up to 98 per cent of men who are diagnosed when the cancer is still contained within the gland will live for more than five years			0
that drops to just 30 per cent if the cancer has spread .			0

@entity11 scientists used drug oxaliplatin to fire up cancer - killing immune cells
drug blocks ‘ b - cells ’ that put a brake on body ’s defences against cancer
there are currently few options in cases of aggressive prostate cancer
