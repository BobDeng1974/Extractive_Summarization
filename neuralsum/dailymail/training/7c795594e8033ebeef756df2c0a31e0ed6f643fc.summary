by @entity0 for @entity1 a $ 67 invention that uses packets of empty chips to purify contaminated water could be @entity7 's answer to saving millions of lives			1
dubbed the @entity10 , four budding university engineers have formulated a design that uses the sun and packets of chips to kill harmful pathogens living inside contaminated water			1
the sun bounces off the reflective layer inside the chip packets and heats the water inside a glass tube - disinfecting contaminants such as faecal matter which may be present			1
the reflective layers from chip packets line inner sides of the timber and reflect the suns rays onto the glass , killing - off the water pathogens inside the product , which cost just $ 67 , is a fraction of the cost of a top of the line design and just as effective although in its early stages , @entity33 engineers @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 hope the product will provide a welcome relief to some of the 780 million people living with limited access to fresh water			1
@entity33 researcher dr @entity46 , who oversaw the design , said contaminated water kills about 2.5 million people a year through dehydration caused by diarrhoea			2
he said the @entity10 - which is built using half a cylinder of reflective material and a meter - and - a - half length of glass tube - could help counteract illness by better purifying water from the source to people 's mouths			1
the university has teamed up with @entity61 working in @entity62 to implement a trial of the design			1
dr @entity46 said he hopes it will help to reverse the affects of water - borne illnesses in @entity62 , which claim the lives of 900 children annually			2
' during the wet season in @entity62 the water comes from the roofs of houses which is littered with faecal matter from birds presenting a real problem , ' he said			0
and during the dry season the same faecal matter is collected in rivers and floats down stream , contaminating fresh water			0
the four students behind the design the @entity10 with @entity84 are @entity34 , @entity37 , @entity36 and @entity35 he said western civilisation 's bid to reverse water - borne deaths in places such as @entity89 has been fruitless and more needs to be done			0
' western countries have invested over $ 1 billion in water treatment in @entity89 which has failed , ' he said			2
' so we need to work with @entity61 's and locals to help countries to rectify these issues			0
' the revolutionary , yet extremely cheap design , uses the highly reflective layer inside a chip packet and the sun 's heat to actively kill contaminants inside the water			1
the prototype can be attached to a larger water system which connects the water from the source to the home			0
chips are a universal product which can easily be recycled in even the poorest of countries the students trialled the product by hooking it up to a water system and testing the results at the other end in testing the product the students found that the quality of the reflectivity is only a ' couple percent worse than the best product			2
' dr @entity46 said the best manufactured prototype in the workshop cost about $ 4,500 - a fraction of the $ 67 price tag for the @entity10 invention which was mostly spent on timber			0
already the idea is being rolled - out in @entity62 with the help of @entity61 , @entity129			1
dr @entity46 said the plan is to work with @entity61 's to create a solution to help communities reverse their poor living conditions on the ground			0
the purification project is now getting international interest , from places such as @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 , dr @entity46 said .			0

four @entity33 engineering students have designed a life - saving water treatment product using chip packets , glass tubing and the sun
the product works by heating the water inside the tube to kill off the contaminants inside
the reflective layer inside chip packets is a *key* material used to *intensify* the ultra *violet* light
it is now being trialled in @entity62 with the help of @entity61
