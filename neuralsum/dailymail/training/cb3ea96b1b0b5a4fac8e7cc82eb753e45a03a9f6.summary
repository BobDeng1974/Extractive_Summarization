by @entity0 published : 17:57 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 20:12 est , 19 september 2012 negligence claims : @entity2 and @entity3 lost their twins after medics failed to spot a ruptured uterus after losing their only son @entity7 at the age of 16 , @entity2 and @entity3 were desperate to build a family again			1
they went through 13 bouts of @entity13 before mrs @entity3 became pregnant again – this time with twins			1
but an inquest yesterday heard how the birth turned to tragedy following a string of medical failings			0
mrs @entity3 was rushed to hospital suffering from severe stomach pain just 30 weeks into her pregnancy			1
after being transferred to another hospital and enduring an agonising wait to be treated her baby boy @entity23 was stillborn and his twin sister @entity27 died the following day			1
the hearing found medics had failed to spot mrs @entity3 , 49 , had suffered a rupture to her uterus when she arrived at the @entity32 near @entity33 in july 2009			1
her condition worsened as she waited two hours for a caesarean section that resulted in @entity23 being stillborn and @entity27 showing no signs of life			1
after 22 minutes of resuscitation @entity27 began breathing again but she had suffered such severe brain damage that the @entity40 – who lost their son @entity7 to a brain haemorrhage – agreed to turn off her life support machine the next day			1
@entity45 heard midwives had ignored the warning signs of mrs @entity3 ’s condition despite the fact she was in severe pain			2
consultant gynaecologist @entity51 said the lack of uterine activity and a foetal heartbeat should have sent alarm bells ringing then			0
the inquest was being held into the death of @entity27 only because there are no inquests into the deaths of stillborn children			2
it heard that when mrs @entity3 arrived at the @entity64 a midwife could only detect one heartbeat instead of the two there should have been			0
but at this point at 12.40pm medics believed she was in premature labour and had not diagnosed a ruptured uterus			1
there was then a two hour delay before a caesarean section was performed in which time @entity27 is believed to have suffered severe brain damage			2
the hearing found medics had failed to spot mrs @entity3 , 49 , had suffered a rupture to her uterus when she arrived at the @entity32 near @entity33 in july 2009 @entity64 coroner @entity80 recorded a narrative verdict saying : ‘ @entity27 was well at 12.40pm – it is most likely there was a critical event then with things changing radically but not being appreciated by the medical staff			1
they have acknowledged that today			0
‘ because it was not appreciated that she was in serious difficulties there was a considerable delay in doing a caesarean section			0
@entity27 was not delivered for two hours – more than enough for the damage to have been done			2
‘ she died from brain damage caused by the rupture which went undiagnosed in labour resulting in delay in the delivery			0
’ the inquest heard the local @entity100 had accepted failing in their standard of care and offered its apologies to the @entity40 who were living near @entity33 at the time			0
after the hearing @entity106 , who now lives in @entity107 , @entity104 said : ‘ this happened three years ago but the pain is still there and will never , ever go away			0
’ her husband , 50 , said : ‘ we feel that @entity27 ’s death was a mixture of incompetence , negligence and a cavalier attitude			0
’ the couple are pursuing a legal case against the hospital for negligence .			0
