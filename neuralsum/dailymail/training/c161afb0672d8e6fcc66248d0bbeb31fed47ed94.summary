a beautiful city nestled in the clouds			0
where the sun â€™s constantly shining and its inhabitants live a life of bliss			0
rapture , this is n't			0
but for those yearning for the damp , claustrophobic atmosphere that made the last two games such hits , it 's not long before @entity1 reveals its sinister underbelly			0
@entity15 's the limit : you 'll often just want to stand and stare at the stunning views			1
but most of the time , you 'll die very quickly if you do			0
set in 1912 during a period of @entity22 , you play former @entity24 agent @entity23 who 's on a rescue mission to save a lady called @entity27			1
upon finding himself in @entity1 ( after one of the game 's splendid in - game cutscenes ) he 's soon harried and chased by the dystopia 's warring factions - the nativist founders and the @entity34			1
he 's also on the run from the @entity37 - a menacing flying robot who 's been @entity27 's guardian for the 12 years that she 's been imprisoned			1
immediately noticeable are the graphics - which are based on the @entity41 - almost unrecognisable given the amount of customisation @entity44 have done			1
beauty and the beast : @entity27 has been kept captive for 12 years , and is guarded by a huge metal beast called the @entity37			0
buildings stand tall , proudly displaying their venetian-esque splendour			0
intricately - laid cobbled roads are frequently interrupted with extravagant water fountains			1
there is no doubt that the sun - kissed world of @entity1 is a graphical masterpiece			1
gameplay , however , stills feels very much like a @entity59 game - albeit with a few tweaks			1
guns are used by the right trigger , while powers and mutations , the left			0
mutations available in the preview were a fireball - which engulfed foes and reduced them to charred embers , birds that could be released to tear people apart , and possession - which can be used to turn enemies against each other			1
similar to the @entity76 in the previous games - @entity23 can collect salts , which - when he has enough - can be used to trigger the mutations			2
this will come in handy : this claw - like weapon can be used to traverse the city 's sky lines , however , it also acts as brutal melee weapon			2
there are also plenty of man - made weapons , ranging from the trusty pistol to the high - velocity machine gun			1
but it 's a claw - like melee device that is perhaps the most useful			2
this allows you traverse the city 's skylines - and being magnetic - lets you perform death - defying leaps			2
indeed , this is much more vertically - layered than its predecessors - levels clearly designed to encourage gamers to explore and experiment			1
the claw is also a brutally powerful melee weapon - a press of the button sees @entity23 jam it into an enemy 's skull one minute , or cleanly decapitate them the next			2
sometimes , you 'll walk into areas designed to give you optional battles			1
for example , you may decide to gun down a load of @entity115 , which will alert guards to your position			0
if , instead , you leave them be , the nearby guards will be none - the - wiser to your location and you 'll avoid a firefight			2
it 's a bold move changing a winning formula , but @entity1 may be one of the rare examples where the risk pays off			0
it 's released on march 26			0
spoiler alert ! see the first few opening minutes of the game here : follow us on @entity132 : @ @entity133 and on @entity134 : @entity135 .			0

*amazing* level of *detail* in levels with ' optional battles ' *depending* on your play style
stunning graphics using custom engine with an @entity41 3 foundation
console version said to look like ' *mid* to high ' *pc* graphics - ensuring near optimal experience for @entity152 and @entity153 owners
