but a new study has revealed that far from being buttoned - up , @entity5 are more than twice as likely as @entity7 to sleep naked			1
when asked about their bedroom attire , 30 per cent of @entity9 admitted to nodding off in the nude – compared with 12 per cent of respondents from the @entity7 and just 9 per cent of @entity12			1
