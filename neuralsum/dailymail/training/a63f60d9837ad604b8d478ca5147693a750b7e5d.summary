@entity1 candidates appear poised to ride a wave of @entity4 - fatigued discontent to victory on nov. 4			2
new poll numbers show voters preferring unnamed @entity1 candidates by seven percentage points over their @entity11 opponents			1
that lead , from a @entity14 poll released wednesday night , grows to eight points when undecided voters tell pollsters which way they 're ' leaning			1
' most stunning is the split on terrorism issues , with @entity1 outpolling @entity11 by 20 percentage points on the question of who handles it better			1
@entity26 ' likely voters ' also prefer republicans by a 10 per cent margin on foreign affairs , seven points on the economy and 2 on immigration			1
@entity33 to read the poll numbers fired up : @entity36 , the @entity1 challenger in a @entity39 @entity26 @entity38 race , has led @entity11 sen. @entity40 in 6 of the last 7 published polls and holds an edge of nearly 4 percentage points on average @entity45 ? @entity47 's @entity11 secretary of state , @entity46 ( left ) , has trailed @entity1 sen. @entity48 in 27 of the last 32 published polls , despite help from @entity51 holding on : @entity11 sen. @entity52 ( right ) leads in most polls against former sen. @entity54 ( left ) , but the @entity56 - model - looking @entity1 is gaining the numbers are doubly sobering for @entity11 in the light of history : in 1994 , a year when @entity1 picked up 54 @entity61 seats and took over for the first time since 1952 , @entity11 held on to a 5 - point advantage in @entity65 polling right up to @entity66			1
the @entity1 tea party wave of 2010 , a more recent point of comparison , came on the heels of a four - point @entity1 polling advantage			1
the new @entity14 poll indicates an even more dramatic sweep could come tuesday			1
other polls , from news organizations like @entity77 , the @entity76 , @entity78 and the @entity79 , paint an overall picture that looks much the same			0
in the last seven published generic - ballot polls , @entity11 congressional candidates have n't led by more than a single point			1
@entity1 average three points ahead			2
election dynamics are about more than a broad national mood , however			0
statewide contests can come down to local differences in campaign tactics and volunteer strength , and even in technology			0
@entity11 strategist @entity92 told @entity78 this week that ' negative energy toward the president ' will contribute significantly to the result , but ' intense hand - to - hand combat ' will also make a difference			0
' it could be that one side has a really kickass mobilization field director , which could have nothing to do with the fierce ideological struggle between the parties in @entity104 , ' @entity92 said			0
the @entity1 needs to gain just six seats in the @entity38 in order to control both chambers of @entity108 , effectively neutering the president during his final two years in the @entity61			1
in the fall of 2013 , @entity11 held 10 - to 12 - point advantages in most so - called ' generic ' ballot polls			1
but that lead has evaporated after a year of stunning setbacks for @entity4 and his party			0
january runoff ? democrat @entity116 ( right ) and @entity1 @entity117 ( left ) will have to face a do - over three days after the new @entity38 convenes , unless one of them can win 50 per cent of the vote on nov. 4 @entity1 congressional candidates hold a sizable lead over @entity11 , according to a range of polls averaged by @entity125 ; their positions were reversed a year ago the flubbed rollout of the @entity129 website set the pace for a dismal year that included a contempt of @entity108 finding against attorney general @entity133 – the first such vote in @entity26 history – and renewed questions about the administration 's handling of the 2012 @entity140 terror attack			1
the rise of @entity142 , the self - declared @entity143 of @entity144 and @entity145 , has brought @entity26 a new round of @entity148 angst , as @entity4 steadfastly refuses to enter another desert war with ground troops			0
@entity1 have harped on him for pulling @entity26 forces out of @entity144 at the end of 2011 , which they claim left a power vacuum that gave the terror army room to grow			2
the @entity26 economy lies stagnant , with shrinking gdp - growth numbers announced thursday at the @entity61			2
@entity159 's economic engine is now projected to overtake @entity26 's , and the proportion of @entity26 working - age adults who have jobs – the so - called ' labor participation rate ' – is just 62.7 per cent			2
that 's the lowest since 1978 , when @entity167 - era economics began pushing @entity26 to the point of embracing a @entity1 solution in the person of @entity171			1
@entity172 is n't helping matters			0
a variety of polls show the @entity177 's performance inspiring levels of confidence among @entity26 that rank somewhere between middling and nonexistent			0
@entity181 : @entity182 , a political independent running against @entity185 @entity1 sen. @entity184 , says that if he wins he will caucus with whichever party wins the majority @entity188 ( @entity190 ) thin : @entity191 ( right ) , the @entity1 former pig farmer running for @entity38 in @entity192 , holds just a 2 - point margin in her race against @entity196 @entity195 and fears about coming changes to @entity26 's immigration system – policy shifts that @entity4 has pledged to execute by fiat – are creating a sense of urgency among conservatives			1
they hold a sizable ' enthusiasm gap ' over @entity11 , with between 7 and 13 per cent more of them saying they are fired up about voting , according to a range of polls			2
that puts @entity1 in a position to not just win legislative seats on tuesday , but to steamroll the field – growing their majority in the @entity217 , winning gubernatorial fights and holding as many as 53 or 54 @entity38 seats when the dust settles			1
the @entity1 holds 45 seats now , and at least three @entity11 incumbents – in @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225 – seem headed for sure defeat			1
another seven races are considered in play and ripe for the picking , and @entity1 candidates have gained momentum in six of them during the past two weeks , polls show			0
@entity11 incumbents in @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity39 , @entity192 , @entity236 , @entity237 and @entity238 look vulnerable to varying degrees			0
offsetting those risks , however , @entity1 could lose seats they hold in @entity185 and @entity242			2
if a 50 - 50 split should result , @entity11 would retain the majority since vice president @entity245 – as ' president ' of the @entity38 – could cast tiebreaking votes			2
adding to the drama , @entity242 and @entity236 both have runoff provisions in their laws , forcing a second election between the top two @entity38 candidates if no one wins 50 per cent of the vote on nov. 4			0
a @entity236 runoff between @entity11 sen. @entity257 and @entity258 congressman @entity258 would come on december 6			0
a @entity242 do - over , pitting @entity196 @entity116 against @entity1 @entity117 for a rare open seat , would n't happen until january 6			0
that 's three days after the next @entity38 is sworn in			0
@entity1 hope the drama has long subsided by then , making runoffs a matter of icing , not cake .			0

@entity14 poll shows likely @entity26 voters prefer republicans by 10 per cent on foreign affairs , seven points on the economy and 2 on immigration
generic polling looks better for @entity1 than in 1994 or 2010 , when the @entity1 made historic gains
very little good news for @entity11 as they 're expected to lose between 7 and 10 @entity38 seats , handing the @entity1 total control of @entity108
tight contests are widening in @entity1 ' favor and races once thought *unwinnable* for the @entity1 now look within their grasp
7 - point lead for @entity1 overall *expands* to 8 points when undecided voters tell pollsters which way they 're ' leaning '
