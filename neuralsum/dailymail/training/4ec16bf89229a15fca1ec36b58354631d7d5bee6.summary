an @entity1 town has become the first in the country to ban beauty contests calling them sexist and discriminatory			2
the pageants are popular in the @entity7 country and often lead to winners gaining greater fame and fortune			0
but in the city of @entity14 , in the province of @entity12 , have said they will no longer crown a queen based on her physical appearance			1
making a stand : beauty pageants are popular in the @entity7 but one city has decided they wo n't hold the competition anymore damaging : the city of @entity14 say the beauty pageants they have previously held ' reinforce the idea that women must be valued and rewarded exclusively by their physical appearance , based on stereotypes ' they say the practice is damaging to women as it forces them to live up to a ' stereotypical ' ideal of beauty which can lead to them developing eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia			1
the ruling has caused heated debate in the country where beauty pageants are a common element in regional festivals where a ' queen ' is chosen to represent the town for a year			1
women who participate are usually between 15 and 25 - years - old and are judged on categories such as ' beauty ' , ' personality ' , and ' poise ' after parading in a number of outfits including swimsuits			1
the new legislation was put forward by the @entity53 and the @entity54 of the local branch of the @entity56 ( @entity55 )			0
the new legislation was put forward by the @entity53 and the @entity54 of the local branch of the @entity56 ( @entity55 ) success : members of the group who lobbied for beauty contests to be banned in the past : from now on , young people in @entity14 will be rewarded for their efforts in the community rather than for their looks it was supported by the mayor of @entity14 and several @entity70 , and passed by the local council by 12 votes and five abstentions out of the 17 councillors present during the debate			1
outlining the reasons for its decision they said that such contests ' reinforce the idea that women must be valued and rewarded exclusively by their physical appearance , based on stereotypes '			1
they added that they are ' a discriminatory and sexist practice ' , and an ' act of symbolic and institutional violence against women and children			2
' banned : @entity92 was crowned earlier this month but one city in @entity1 has decided they wo n't hold a similar beauty pageant from now on ' sexist practice ' : the @entity14 council warned that rewarding women for beauty over achievements can lead to eating disorder instead , the beauty pageant traditionally carried out as part of the celebrations for the anniversary of the foundation of the city will be replaced by an event celebrating the achievements of young people and the difference they have made to the community			1
they stated that the new contest would be for ' people between 15 and 30 years who , in an individual or collective way , have stood out in volunteering activities aimed at improving the quality of life in neighbourhoods within the city or the district			0
' @entity122 of the local @entity55 branch said of the decision to ban beauty pageants : ' it 's a very important achievement			2
it has an enormous symbolic value			0
the municipal state made the decision , within the framework of this bill , to stop subjecting the women of @entity14 to the exhibition , objectification , and selection that beauty pageants imply , with the added bonus that instead they will promote other values that aim to encourage the construction of citizenship with a gender equality			1
' last september , the @entity143 government banned beauty contests for children under the age of 16 on grounds that participants are subjected to hyper - sexualisation			2
more than just a pretty face : this year 's @entity92 winner , @entity151 , 22 , from @entity152 , is a bilingual medical student in a similar move , @entity154 mps proposed a ban on child beauty pageants as they harm children physically , psychologically and intellectually			1
more recently the organisers of the most famous beauty pageant of all - @entity92 - announced they will no longer have a swimsuit round in the competition			1
in an interview with @entity165 , chairwoman @entity163 explained : ' i really ... do n't need to see women just walking up and down in bikinis			0
it does n't do anything for the woman			0
and it does n't do anything for any of us			0
' she added : ' i do n't care if someone has a bottom two inches bigger than someone else 's			0
we are really not looking at her bottom			0
we are really listening to her speak			0
' the motto of the competition - which started in the @entity183 - is ' beauty with a purpose '			2
they encourage participants to support and get involved in charity projects and prove they have brains as well as beauty			0
' beauty with purpose ' : @entity151 said she wants to use her position to promote education @entity194 : @entity92 has announced they are now dropping their swimsuit round which as been part of the pageant for decades this was illustrated by their year 's winner , @entity151 from @entity152 , who was crowned @entity92 earlier this month			1
the 22 - year - old is a bilingual medical student who wants to use her position to promote the importance of a good education			1
she said : ' @entity203 today because of the opportunities i have received and i would love to give others the same opportunities ; educating , the opportunity to be educated , to make healthy choices and also to live their dreams			0
' as @entity92 , people look up to you and see you as an independent , strong woman			2
that 's the picture i 'd like to show people out there			0
