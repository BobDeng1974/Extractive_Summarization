by @entity0 published : 15:53 est , 6 january 2013 updated : 05:28 est , 7 january 2013 an ambulance crew took forty - one minutes to reach a critically ill six week old baby because they finished their break before responding to the emergency 999 call			1
@entity6 died for four minutes after suffering a cardiac arrest and he continues to fight for his life at @entity9 two weeks after he stopped breathing and started to turn blue at his home			1
the child has endured 14 hours of open heart surgery in 11 days since his parents ' emergency call to @entity16 - and now faces a potential life of disability			2
his grandfather , @entity19 , a former fireman from @entity20 , @entity21 , has now vowed to ' fight until his last breath ' to improve ambulance services so no family ever have to endure the same heartache			1
six - week old @entity6 who suffered a heart attack over @entity27 but had to wait 45 minutes for an ambulance to arrive			1
he is still recovering in hospital ambulance bosses have now confirmed that the mercy crew which responded to the family 's 999 call could not be dispatched until they had finished their break			1
they had opted to take ' undisturbed breaks ' , which meant they did not show up on the operator 's system at the time			0
mr @entity6 , a 56 year - old fire risk assessor , said : ' i understand that they have got to have breaks , but , if years ago when i was a fire officer , i had sat outside someone 's burning house and told them i was just going to finish my sandwich , i do n't think they would have been at all pleased			1
' they knew how critically ill @entity6 was and how important time was			1
i think it 's disgusting			0
' a spokesman for @entity16 said : ' the crews work 12 - hour shifts and obviously have the right to a meal break			2
individual staff can request that their break is not disturbed , meaning that they will not show up as an available ambulance to send to jobs			1
the service is duty bound to honour that choice			0
' the crew that was sent to @entity6 was on an undisturbed break when the 999 call came through			1
as soon as it was over , they were shown as available and sent to @entity20			0
' mr @entity6 spent much of @entity27 drumming up support for his @entity69 to @entity20 campaign which he said he promised @entity71 he would win while his grandson was on a life support machine			1
he spent nine days - including @entity74 night - to get people to sign his petition and has collected around 2,000 signatures in just nine days			0
he said he does not want another family to suffer such heartache			0
he said : ' it is always going to be in our minds that the damage that has been done to @entity6 's heart was caused by the hold - up of the ambulance service			1
' my grandson will have a disability and he 's going to miss out on so much			0
it is breaking our hearts			0
' if we had an ambulance in @entity20 he could have been in hospital in half an hour			2
' he would n't have gone into cardiac arrest , and he would n't have gone into respiratory arrest in the ambulance on the way over			1
' i wo n't stop			0
i promised @entity6 when he was fighting for his life on a machine that i will fight until my last breath so another family will not have to go through what we have gone through			1
i feel the service @entity6 got was what you 'd expect in a third world country			1
' ' there are days when we do n't have any paramedic cover in @entity20 at all			0
the support i have had from the whole town is amazing			0
' @entity114 @entity19 , from @entity20 , has now launched a campaign for a better ambulance service @entity6 has endured 14 hours of open heart surgery in 11 days since his parents emergency call to @entity16 surrounded by tubes , @entity6 has two injections every day to prevent another devastating blood clot from developing on his heart			1
now aged eight weeks , his sports - loving family have been told that he will never be able to kick a ball around with his friends or take part in any contact sport			0
his parents , @entity131 and @entity132 , dialled 999 at 12.47pm on december 17 from their home in @entity20 , @entity134			0
the family waited for 15 minutes for help from a community paramedic , despite living just 300 yards away from the mercy base in @entity139 , where the family claim 24/7 cover was promised when the town 's ambulance station was closed in april			1
they say there was no - one working in @entity20 so a community paramedic had to travel from nearby @entity147			0
it took until 13.28pm for an ambulance to respond to their life - saving call because it had to travel from @entity153			1
@entity6 was initially taken to @entity154 in @entity155			1
mr @entity6 said : ' @entity6 was struggling to breathe and his breathing was really rapid			1
you could see his little chest going up and down , and he was going blue at the lips			0
' as soon as he got into the @entity154 he went into cardiac arrest and @entity131 , @entity132 and my wife @entity161 watched for three hours as anaesthetists desperately tried to provide him with oxygen			1
there was blood pouring out of his mouth			0
it was the most awful thing to witness			0
' doctors at the @entity155 hospital spent eight hours stabilising @entity6 before he was transferred to @entity9			1
the next day he underwent his first six hours of open - heart surgery , and two more the day after , as doctors closed his tiny chest back up			0
but the family 's heartache was far from over			0
a week after his first operation doctors discovered a leak in one of @entity6 's heart valves had worsened and that the already weak baby would need to go back under the knife			1
' we thought he was doing really well but then he took a turn for the worse , ' @entity19 said			2
' two doctors were trying to get lines into him with drugs and adrenaline but they could n't get them into his little arms or legs			0
the family still have a pile of unopened @entity27 presents ready to open with baby @entity6 ' in the end they managed to get two canulas into his head and it was a good job because he crashed right at that moment			2
' @entity6 was taken in for four more hours of surgery to replace his mitral valve with an artificial valve and then endured another two hours to close his chest again			2
he will need a further operation around the age of 12 to have the artificial valve replaced with a larger one as he grows			0
' i had a little , weak smile off him the other day and it was just heartbreaking , ' mr @entity6 said			2
' he 's been through such a lot but he 's a real fighter			0
' mr @entity6 said the ambulance response time was slower than that of a vet attending his elderly mother 's dog @entity212			1
he added : ' it 's absolutely ridiculous that a vet can get to a sick dog within 15 minutes but it takes them almost an hour to get a baby to hospital			2
' the family have also started raising funds for @entity9 and @entity224 has already been donated to their appeal from a quiz night at the @entity227 in @entity20			0
a spokesman for @entity16 said : ' due to the level of demand at the time of the call , every ambulance in @entity230 was committed to a patient			2
' the @entity236 arrived 15 minutes after the start of the call and began to treat the boy			2
' throughout all this time , the control room continued to search for an available ambulance			2
' it is also important to note that at the time of the call to @entity139 , an elderly woman who had suffered a stroke in @entity20 , was already being tended to by an ambulance crew and was taken to @entity154 , becoming available at 1.42pm			1
' there would not have been an ambulance available in @entity20 and an ambulance would have been called in from elsewhere to tend to the boy			2
the response would not have been quicker ; it could even have been longer			0

@entity6 died for four minutes after suffering a cardiac arrest
it has been confirmed crew ' finished break ' before responding to call
his grandfather @entity19 has now launched campaign to improve ambulance services
