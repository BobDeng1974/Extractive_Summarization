buoyant after their strong domestic performance last week , @entity0 will look to overcome the absence of key players including striker @entity4 in wednesday 's @entity6 quarter - final first leg against @entity7			1
@entity0 beat @entity8 bitter rivals @entity9 3 - 2 , thrashed @entity10 4 - 1 in the @entity12 semi-finals , and won the @entity13 final 4 - 0 against @entity14 on saturday			2
even if they will be without the suspended @entity4 and @entity16 and the injured @entity17 , @entity0 believe they are peaking			1
@entity0 will be without the suspended @entity4 and @entity16 against @entity7 ' do i feel a new momentum ? it 's been the case for a while			1
we worked physically ( during the winter break ) and today , in money time , we 're good , ' said coach @entity27			0
' we are gaining momentum while last year at the same time we were on the way down			0
' both teams have been meeting regularly recently in the @entity6 , with @entity0 beating @entity7 3 - 2 at home in a @entity33 game this season before losing 3 - 1 at the @entity35			1
the @entity8 champions will also have to cope without the injured @entity17 against the @entity38 giants @entity7 had reached the semi-finals in 2013 by eliminating @entity0 on away goals , drawing 1 - 1 at home after a 2 - 2 stalemate in @entity43			1
' the quarter - final tie is going to be very different from the group stage			1
there is a lot more at stake and in football no game is ever the same , ' former @entity7 and @entity0 winger @entity46 said			2
@entity7 's 2 - 2 draw at @entity53 in @entity38 on saturday , when they threw away a 2 - 0 lead , prompted renewed concerns about their defensive frailty , with both the concedded goals down to mistakes from the @entity7 rearguard			2
goalkeeper @entity60 made an uncharacteristic handling error to let in @entity63 's long - range strike before halftime and centre back @entity65 's loss of possession in midfield led to the @entity71 club 's late equaliser			0
@entity73 right back @entity72 is suspended for the @entity6 clash with the @entity8 outfit the stalemate in @entity53 meant @entity7 's lead over second - placed @entity78 at the top of @entity38 was cut to two points but they remain on course to repeat the 2009 historic treble of @entity6 and @entity84 league and @entity12			1
@entity7 's @entity85 right back @entity72 is suspended for wednesday 's game , with @entity87 or @entity88 likely to replace him in the starting lineup			0
@entity65 , however , is unfazed as @entity7 would once again bank on their formidable attacking trio			0
' i 've never before seen a relationship like the one between @entity94 ( @entity95 ) , @entity96 ( @entity97 ) and @entity98 ( @entity99 )			0
we 're talking about three of the best players in the world , ' he said			0
the second leg will be played at the @entity35 on april 21 .			0

@entity0 take on @entity7 in the @entity6 quarter - final first leg
but @entity8 leaders will be without a trio of key players for the fixture
@entity4 , @entity17 and @entity16 are all *missing*
@entity38 giants @entity7 will be without @entity72 for the clash in @entity43
