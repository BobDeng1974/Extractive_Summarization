dr @entity0 , pictured with his wife @entity1 , was sacked after blowing the whistle on shocking standards of care			1
a tribunal has now cleared him of any wrongdoing after a 13 - year battle at a cost of £ 10million the cardiologist sacked after blowing the whistle on shocking @entity11 failures was wrongly accused of sexual misconduct , fraud and assault as part of a decade - long intimidation campaign aimed at forcing him to drop his unfair dismissal case			1
the leading heart surgeon – who spoke out against dangerous overcrowding in @entity11 hospitals - has detailed the extraordinary bullying he suffered as his bosses attempted to blacken his reputation			1
instead of listening to his concerns over the shocking standards of care on the wards , bosses first suspended , then sacked him and then spent millions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money pursuing him through an employment tribunal			2
they also submitted more than 200 false allegations about him to the @entity38 – all of which , he says , were rejected			1
dr @entity0 was cleared of any wrongdoing yesterday – after a 13 - year battle thought to have cost the taxpayer £ 10million			1
incredibly , it emerged his bosses also spent thousands of pounds of public money hiring private investigators to look into the @entity48 , and on employing a pr agency to deal with potentially damaging media fallout from the case			0
dr @entity0 said immediately following his decision to blow the whistle , the hospital ’s head of security was asked to monitor his movements to start building a dirt file that could be later used to discredit his reputation			1
he says he believes the @entity11 wanted to ‘ try and find as much information to use against me as possible ’			0
‘ i was accused of fraud , i was accused of sexual impropriety , assaults , not doing my duties and so on , ’ he told the @entity63			0
' unfortunately that is a common practice of many managers within the @entity11 , this denial of what the primary reason is as to why you are targeted			0
‘ it is very hard to believe that it is sheer coincidence that , having never faced , from 1979 to 2001 , any allegations or complaints , that suddenly i should have become so altered in my nature and personality that suddenly more than 200 allegations were justified			0
' i just find it quite difficult to overcome the fact that there is always this attempt to put forward a plausible alternative when the real reason at the heart of why all these allegations were suddenly mustered up is the fact that i had whistle blown , spoken out as an advocate for the patients and was not prepared to accept what was in the best interests of the managers			2
' after the 13 - year ‘ @entity99 ’ battle , a tribunal yesterday found the surgeon had been unfairly dismissed			1
and , in a landmark judgement , the tribunal ruled he had been targeted by hospital managers specifically because he blew the whistle			1
' i ’m absolutely relieved that one of the things that has come out of this case that i have won is that i have been vindicated for what i did , because one of the other key findings of the tribunal is that they found that i had not caused or contributed to towards my dismissal , ' dr @entity0 said			2
' emotionally it has been very draining			0
i have mixed emotions over the judgement : i am relieved that i have won the case , i am also pleased that my detriments have been recognised by the employment tribunal			0
' but the saddest thing out of all of this for me is that the people who have lost out the most are the patients and the public because for 13 years the trust management have prevented me from looking after patients			0
' they have also , in the way they have treated me , discouraged any further whistleblowers in the @entity11 from coming forward and risking having their career and livelihood destroyed			0
' last night the health secretary , mps and patients groups condemned dr @entity0 ’s unacceptable treatment and the outrageous use of public money			1
@entity138 , a @entity139 member of the @entity141 health select committee , said : ‘ the fact that an individual , who has done their best to raise their concerns about patient safety , should have cost the @entity11 this amount of money is absolutely sickening			0
‘ the @entity11 needs to radically reform the way it thinks of whistleblowing			1
’ health secretary @entity152 said : ‘ this shows just how important it is that whistleblowers speaking out about poor care can be confident they will be listened to			1
’ dr @entity0 said he wanted talks with mr @entity152 and @entity11 chief executive @entity158 about his case and the treatment of whistleblowers			1
' i am hoping @entity152 will now grant me a meeting and mr @entity158 , the new chief executive of the @entity11 , will eventually meet with me so that we may discuss my experiences and , perhaps most importantly , learn important lessons that will prevent any other doctor from being treated this way , ' he said			2
he warned ' the protection presently available in the @entity11 is not adequate ’ for those doctors and nurses who want to speak out			0
' the @entity11 needs to radically reform the way it thinks of whistleblowing			2
this shows just how important it is ' - health secretary @entity152 dr @entity0 first voiced concerns about the high death rate for heart bypass operations at @entity180 in 1999 , which at the time had far higher death rates than expected			1
he blamed at least two of the deaths on the cost - cutting practice of putting five patients into bays equipped for only four			0
in one case dr @entity0 and two senior nursing colleagues lodged an official report after a 35 - year - old patient died because staff could not reach him with vital lifesaving equipment in an overcrowded bay			1
when the @entity195 failed to respond to his concerns , or those of the @entity198 and the @entity199 , dr @entity0 decided to go public , and spoke to the @entity63			2
this , he said , led to the start of a ‘ witch - hunt ’			0
five months after appearing on the @entity63 he was suspended not for clinical mistakes or for whistle - blowing , but for allegedly bullying a junior colleague – claims that were later disproven			0
meeting : dr @entity0 wants to explain his point of view to health secretary @entity152 judgment : a tribunal ruling found against managers at the @entity211 in @entity180 , now @entity180 after seven years being suspended on full pay , in 2007 the £ 70,000 a year cardiologist finally had his suspension lifted – becoming the longest - suspended doctor in the country			1
but the trust made it impossible for him to return to his previous position , a @entity217 heard yesterday			0
dr @entity0 claims he experienced increasing hostility from the trust management			2
then , after raising grievance proceedings he faced further false allegations			0
dr @entity0 said : ' i can only hope that the @entity11 learns from my case and starts to listen to doctors and nurses ' after a short period in work , dr @entity0 ’s health deteriorated as a result of these unsubstantiated allegations , and he was forced to take sick leave in february 2010			1
dr @entity0 was eventually sacked by the @entity195 in 2010 – while he was still in his hospital bed – nine years after he first raised concerns about dangerous post-operative care			1
judge @entity239 and her panel at the @entity217 yesterday ruled the @entity195 unjustifiably treated dr @entity0 by dismissing him as a consequence of his illness			1
judge @entity239 added that dr @entity0 did not in any way cause or contribute to his dismissal			2
however , the tribunal said it could not prove that dr @entity248 ’s claim that his dismissal in 2010 was a direct result of whistleblowing because ‘ those claims were presented out of time ’			0
dr @entity0 ’s lawyer claims the @entity195 submitted over 200 false allegations about him to the @entity38 , resulting in the cardiologist being investigated from 2002 to 2009 and 2011 to 2013			1
they say this makes him the @entity260 ’s most investigated doctor by the @entity38			0
however , according to mr @entity0 ’s lawyers , the @entity38 has never found cause to proceed to an inquiry , instead rejecting the many and varied allegations			0
following yesterday ’s judgment , dr @entity0 ’s solicitor , @entity265 at @entity266 , said dr @entity0 was ‘ completely vindicated ’			2
a statement from @entity180 said it was disappointed with the ruling .			0

dr @entity0 was sacked after *exposing* two patients had died in dangerously overcrowded bays at @entity180
heart surgeon endured more than a decade of bullying from @entity11 bosses
@entity11 submitted 200 false allegations against him that *included* claims of fraud , assault , professional *negligence* and sexual misconduct
the stress of the allegations eventually left dr @entity0 too sick to work
he says @entity11 attacked his reputation and livelihood to discourage any other potential whistleblowers from speaking out
@entity217 cleared him of wrongdoing after 13 - year battle costing £ 10million
landmark judgement ruled he was unfairly dismissed and targeted by hospital managers because he blew the whistle on poor care
health secretary @entity152 said @entity11 must ' radically reform ' the way it thinks about whistleblowers , adding it is ' important ' doctors are listened to
hospital trust said it is ' disappointed ' with the tribunal *'s* ruling
