by @entity0 published : 12:41 est , 21 january 2014 updated : 13:09 est , 21 january 2014 a 500 - year - old @entity6 mansion boasting a 100ft great hall , three priest holes and its own ghost is for sale for £ 4.75million			1
@entity9 , described as the finest private house in @entity11 , has five ensuite bedrooms , a moat , and an arboretum with rare trees , but its real draw is its history			1
owned by a grand @entity20 family for centuries , the @entity18 has secret places where outlawed @entity20 priests could hide when the terrifying priest - hunters came to call during the reformation			1
@entity9 , which dates back to the tudor period , was a @entity20 stronghold and boasts three priest 's holes in which outlawed catholic priests could hide when the feared priest - hunters came to call life - saving hiding place : this priest hole , hidden beneath in a spiral stone staircase in @entity9 , was designed by carpenter @entity34 guardians of history : @entity37 and @entity38 , left , who live at @entity9 with their three children , have spent ' millions ' renovating the rare @entity6 mansion feared by @entity20 who continued to practise their religion even after it was made illegal , priest - hunters would arrive with skilled carpenters who would spend up to a week ripping out panelling and pulling up floorboards looking for priests			1
@entity9 , which was one of the famous @entity20 safehouses in the reign of @entity51 , has three such holes hidden in the fabric of the stone , grade i - listed mansion			1
one of them , hidden within a stone turret housing a spiral staircase , was created by master carpenter @entity34 , and is said by experts to be the finest example of a priest 's hole in the country			0
@entity34 , who died under torture in the @entity65 in 1606 , was later canonised for his role in ensuring the future of @entity68 , and his work in creating spaces where priests could escape capture played a key role in @entity75 history			0
@entity76 , which lies seven miles outside @entity77 , was owned by the @entity79 family from 1517 until they sold up in 1982 , but much of its original furnishings and artefacts are still there , including paintings , tapestries and furniture			2
hailed as a rare perfect - not added to or rebuilt - example of @entity89 building on a grand scale , it was built using stones from @entity92 between 1557 and 1584 , replacing a late medieval manor house on the same spot that burnt down			1
@entity95 , the future @entity95 , hid in the original house as a guest of the @entity99 in 1553 on her way to claim the throne , and it is said the @entity103 , hot on her heels , burnt it down when he found she had escaped dressed as a dairy maid			1
beautifully restored : @entity18 has fine wooden panelling and plenty of original features dating back to the tudor period place of worship : the house , one of the most famous @entity20 strongholds in the @entity116 , comes with its own chapel @entity9 boasts grade i - listed gardens with formal gardens , a wildflower meadow , a moat , pinetum , and arboretum with rare trees @entity95 is said to have told her hosts not to worry , and promised to build them a better house , and the current @entity9 , which was occupied by the @entity127 during the @entity128 , is the result			1
after the @entity99 sold it , @entity18 became a language school and was then bought by an internet tycoon who hoped to turn it into a five - star hotel			2
but when he lost interest and emigrated to @entity137 , it was bought by former hedge fund manager @entity138 in 2010			0
since then , he and his wife @entity140 have spent millions of pounds restoring the building , adding a bespoke kitchen by kitchen designer @entity143 , five bedroom suites , and a sophisticated zoned heating system			0
the house is said to be haunted by @entity95 , but the @entity147 , who have three young children , say it has never bothered them			2
a campaign to raise the money to buy the house and open it for future generations has been launched by historians and is backed by leading @entity20 including @entity155 and cardinal @entity156 , the former archbishop of westminster			2
modern touches : the @entity38 family , who have owned @entity76 since 2010 , have added an expensive , bespoke @entity143 kitchen to the @entity6 mansion @entity162 view : @entity9 lies just seven miles outside the city of @entity77 and has grounds of nearly 60 acres , with water gardens , a moat , and specimen plants @entity169 , of the @entity170 , said the house 's rich history made it of interest to everybody , regardless of religion			1
he said : ' we want to buy it and open it as a heritage site for everyone to share			0
it 's just the most beautiful place , and has the most astonishing history			0
' he added : ' one of the priest holes at @entity76 , said to be the best in the country , is ingeniously hidden within the actual thick stone wall of the medieval spiral staircase and can be accessed by lifting the boards of the landing at the top of the stairs			2
' it is a couple of metres long once you get inside it and is a genuine hidden chamber built of stone			0
as you walk up the spiral staircase you could never spot it without knowing it is there			0
' the opening is quite small so the priest would have needed to be quite small to get in through the access			0
my understanding is that it worked in that nobody was ever caught in it during the bad times			0
' he also said @entity76 was designed to allow someone to circulate in such a way that would confuse an intruder			0
@entity9 is for sale through @entity219 estate agents , who say it may be of interest to the new breed of tech millionaires working in @entity77			1
when @entity20 were persecuted by law in @entity225 , beginning in 1558 in the reign of queen elizabeth i , it became an offence to celebrate @entity229 those found breaking the law were fined in the first instance , imprisoned if caught a second time , and imprisoned for life for a third offence			0
imprisonment for a priest often meant torture and execution			0
and those who refused to take the @entity241 , declaring that the @entity95 was the head of the @entity243 , would be found guilty of high treason and could be put to death			0
prince @entity246 examining a priest hole at @entity248 in @entity249 - @entity246 hid in a priest hole in the house after evading @entity252 after the @entity253 in 1651 after the @entity255 , anti-catholic sentiment became even more rabid			2
@entity257 families who were determined to continue in their faith built secret priest holes into their large houses , where priests could hide from the dreaded priest - hunters			1
they would be carved into thick stone walls , dug deep under wooden floorboards , or hidden in thick chimney breasts , and priests would often have to hide in them for days at a time while the priest - hunters laid waste to a house in their bid to uncover evidence of practising @entity20			1
many grand houses had priest holes , including @entity248 in @entity249 , where @entity246 hid in a priest hole after hiding in a tree known as the @entity277 , to avoid capture by @entity279 in 1651 .			1

@entity9 in @entity11 , which is for sale for £ 4.75million , was a @entity20 stronghold in the @entity116
it has three priest holes in which outlawed priests could hide when the feared priest - hunters came looking for them
the @entity18 , where @entity95 hid on her way to claim the throne in 1553 , lies seven miles outside @entity77
despite recent renovations , the hall is said to be a rare example of a @entity89 *domestic* building on a grand scale
