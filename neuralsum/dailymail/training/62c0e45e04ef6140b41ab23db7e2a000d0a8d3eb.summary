by @entity0 and @entity1 archived files have revealed how prime minister @entity3 considered deploying the army against striking miners @entity3 planned to mobilise hundreds of troops and considered declaring a state of emergency at the height of the 1984 miners ’ strike , previously secret files reveal			1
another option was to switch to a three - day working week after ministers warned her that the lights could go out in @entity15 , according to the @entity16			1
as panic appeared to grip the government , mrs @entity3 faced the possibility of defeat in the prolonged and violent strike that became a defining episode of her time in power			1
the dispute was triggered in march 1984 by plans to close 20 loss - making pits			1
@entity27 , leader of the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) , went into battle with the @entity30 and a year - long war of attrition ensued			2
mrs @entity3 had been expecting the confrontation and preparing for it since 1981			0
publicly , she remained resolute , but the files show how , privately , panic surrounded her			2
@entity36 , head of the policy unit , warned that giving in to the unions would be ‘ the end of effective government ’ in @entity15			2
‘ @entity43 ’s aim is to pave the way for the ultimate defeat of the government by destroying its policies and its credibility , ’ he wrote to the prime minister			0
‘ its purpose is to oppose and destroy			0
’ there was stalemate until july , when a dockers ’ dispute escalated into a national strike , giving the @entity28 extra leverage			2
there were fears that power supplies would run out and the @entity59 warned of possible panic - buying of food			1
as the pressure grew , mrs @entity3 held a meeting on july 16 at which declaring a state of emergency was discussed			1
the minutes noted : ‘ it was not clear how far a declaration of a state of emergency would be interpreted as a sign of weakness , nor to what extent it would increase docker support for the miners ’ strike			1
it was suggested that 4,500 military drivers would be needed			0
the government suspected that the @entity28 was receiving hundreds of thousands of pounds from @entity91 during the miners ’ strike			2
@entity94 informed ministers in november 1984 that the @entity96 were funding the union and it was reported in @entity91 that £ 500,000 had been raised by workers to support the strike			1
officials suspected government involvement , with a briefing letter noting that it was ‘ most unlikely that the @entity96 miners ’ union could have been given access to convertible roubles without official permission ’			0
but they had to admit that they were powerless to do anything about the funding and would have to rely on detecting a representative of the @entity28 ‘ entering this country with a suitcase full of bank notes ’			0
@entity28 leader @entity27 has always insisted that the miners received no overseas money			0
in a letter from the @entity120 to @entity121 , the @entity122 ’s private secretary , on july 11 , 1984 the idea was dismissed on the grounds that it would cause panic			1
it said : ‘ my secretary of state [ @entity128 ] … supports the view that the use of servicemen to move existing coal stocks would raise the emotional temperature and recommends that it should not be considered any further at this stage in the dispute			1
’ the correspondence also reveals that one of the options being considered was a state of emergency – proclaimed by the @entity140 – if power supplies were interrupted			1
it spoke of using servicemen ‘ as a last resort ’			0
the concern at the heart of government was summarised in a letter to the pm from @entity149 , the trade and industry secretary , warning her that ‘ time is running out ’			0
dated july 25 , 1984 , he said coal stocks would last until january , adding that the prospect would strengthen the miners ’ resolve			2
‘ i have no wish to rock the boat , and believe it essential that we should continue to present our existing public face , ’ he wrote			0
‘ but it is just as important that we should be utterly realistic among ourselves about what is actually going to happen			0
’ last night , @entity149 recalled that the miners ’ strike was a ‘ close - run thing ’ but said that @entity3 ‘ never wavered ’			1
the files reveal that plans were drawn up for soldiers to transport food and coal			2
it was suggested that 4,500 military drivers would be needed ‘ i was obviously concerned because i was looking after industry and people in industry were concerned so i was expressing those fears , ’ he said			0
his letter alarmed the pm , but she was encouraged by the response of industry leaders following a hastily arranged meeting			0
the prospect of a three - day week remained on the table but in the end the strike failed to have a widespread impact			1
as support among miners and the public drained away , it came to a formal end on march 3 , 1985			0
@entity3 did not mention @entity196 ’s detention during an official meeting with the former prime minister of @entity199 – despite being advised to by the @entity200 , documents reveal			0
@entity3 with @entity199 prime minister @entity201 in 1984 in a briefing paper written by the @entity200 ahead of the four - hour meeting with @entity201 , it was suggested that @entity3 include mr @entity196 ’s release as a ‘ point to make ’			1
the documents reveal that the @entity210 leader ’s imprisonment was mentioned with ‘ little success ’ during a private , 40 - minute ‘ tete - a - tete ’ with mr @entity201 , ahead of the official meeting in 1984			1
a memo about the meeting of the two politicians – who both died last year – notes that @entity3 mentioned mr @entity196 , but mr @entity201 said he was not able to interfere with the official process .			0
