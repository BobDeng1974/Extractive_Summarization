@entity0 has criticised @entity4 's @entity3 for his sloppy display in tuesday night 's @entity2 draw against @entity5			1
the @entity7 midfielder has been used as a makeshift defender in recent weeks , but bundled @entity9 to the ground in the box before the break as the @entity13 fired the visitors ahead from the spot			1
@entity17 's second - half strike spared @entity19 's blushes as the @entity20 came from behind to leave the semi-final on a knife - edge ahead of next week 's second - leg at @entity24			1
@entity4 's @entity3 flattened @entity9 in the box to give @entity5 a first - half penalty can had a night to forget and was criticised by @entity20 stalwart @entity0 but former @entity4 defender @entity0 stuck the boot in to the 21 - year - old			1
' he played really well in the last five or six games bringing the ball out , ' @entity0 told @entity30			2
' but against top - class players he 's been found wanting			0
he got beaten too easily and tried to rectify it and made two mistakes			0
' he found it really difficult and looked like a midfielder playing at the back			0
people say he 's been doing well recently in relation to bringing the ball out , but it was clumsy and a penalty , no doubt about it			2
' @entity44 tries to catch can during tuesday 's game at @entity46 @entity0 received a backlash on social media but took to @entity49 to explain his comments			2
he wrote : ' when i 've seen him ( and i watch every game ) defend he 's struggled at times in the game against @entity55 , @entity56 & on the one occasion tonight it may seem harsh but @entity59 had over 60 % possession so did n't have much defending to do			0
' my point is tonight was the first time he 's come up against top class attackers as the teams previously @entity59 would expect to dominate and win as they have done & he 's impressed			0
' can keeps tabs on @entity5 striker @entity67 but did struggle at times on tuesday great game tonight at @entity46 proper cup tie , but my comments regarding @entity3 at ht & afterwards seemed to get most reaction on social media from @entity59 fans ! my thoughts on can at cb in a back 3 is that he gives control to the team on the ball and helps the team build from the back			1
in a back 3 he will also have less defending to do but , when i 've seen him ( and i watch every game ) defend he 's struggled at times in the game against @entity55 , @entity56 & on the one occasion tonight it may seem harsh but @entity59 had over 60 % possession so did n't have much defending to do and he was good as you 'd expect with the ball & with @entity9 defensivley a couple of times second half			1
my point is tonight was the first time he 's come up against top class attackers as the teams previously @entity59 would expect to dominate and win as they have done & he 's impressed			0
but if the opposition dominate he 'll have to do more defending , and @entity75 's in a back 3 think if you had to put them in a 2 in a back 4 would you want can there probably not but why ? because his main strength is not the defending its bringing the ball out which he 'd do less in a back 4 ! ! hopefully that clears my thoughts up and yes i was n't quick & also made mistakes ! !			0
