by @entity0 last updated at 1:16 am on 28th september 2011 acquitted : teacher @entity1 had unfounded allegations made against him parents of children taught by the teacher forced to move away from his family over unfounded sex allegations have branded his treatment ‘ disgusting ’			1
they insisted yesterday that @entity1 , who was acquitted of touching girls in his primary school class , and his wife @entity11 were excellent teachers			1
the 35 - year - old remains suspended from the classroom – as does mrs @entity14 , 29 , simply for being married to him			2
one father said : ‘ mr @entity1 is a great teacher			1
‘ he ’s taught two of my kids and they thought he was great			0
he ’s very friendly – but that ’s his style of teaching			0
it ’s all been blown out of proportion			0
‘ you do n’t get many young male teachers in primary schools and i hope we see him back here soon			2
’ an unnamed mother said : ‘ it ’s shocking that they would n’t let him live with @entity11 and their son			0
i think what social services did is disgusting , he ’ll never get those first few months back			0
‘ i just hope they can put it all behind them now and start to rebuild their lives			0
’ another woman with children at the school added : ‘ it ’s fantastic that mr @entity1 has been cleared			1
‘ we never thought he was guilty of anything , but we do n’t understand why he ’s still suspended			2
anguish : mr @entity1 , pictured with a woman believed to be his wife @entity11 , leave court after an earlier hearing ‘ also , it ’s really unfair that @entity11 was suspended too			1
it did n’t have anything to do with her			0
‘ she ’s a lovely , lovely woman and she ’s really missed in reception where she teaches			0
’ mr @entity1 was suspended from the school in @entity56 – which can not be named for legal reasons – last year after young girls accused him of kissing them and patting them on the bottom			1
he insisted he had simply been trying to encourage pupils with a clasp of the shoulder , a hug or a pat on the back , and said the allegations that his actions were sexually motivated were ‘ probably malicious ’			0
cleared : it took a jury just 20 minutes to acquit mr @entity1 at @entity70 ( pictured ) while mr @entity1 was awaiting trial earlier this year , his wife gave birth to their first child and social services made him agree not to live with them for eight months			1
after he was acquitted on monday of indecently assaulting five girls , the teacher spoke emotionally about his ‘ horrible ordeal ’			0
however , neither mr @entity1 nor his wife is likely to return to the classroom for many months			1
@entity56 council has only now launched an investigation and both teachers remain suspended while it is carried out			1
it has refused to rule out referring mr @entity1 to the @entity87 , which could launch disciplinary action against him			2
the couple declined to comment yesterday at their £ 250,000 house in nearby @entity92 .			2

@entity1 and his wife described as ' excellent ' teachers
couple remain suspended from the school where they both work
