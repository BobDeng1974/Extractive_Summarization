by @entity0 @entity1 with her @entity2 , after the ceremony at the @entity4 , central @entity5			1
she has fronted campaigns for @entity7 and @entity8 and even starred in a @entity10 movie			1
but @entity1 really caught the world ’s attention in 1997 when she opened up about her horrific female genital mutilation ( @entity14 ) ordeal			1
she has since campaigned tirelessly against the practice and now her efforts have been recognised in the form of a @entity20 award			1
@entity1 , now 48 and living in @entity22 with her four children , was just five years old when she was subjected to @entity14 in her home country of @entity25			1
she was then forced into marrying a 60 - year - old man when she was just thirteen , a threat which left her no choice but to flee to @entity29 , where she had family			0
she later moved to @entity5 to live with relatives and worked in a local @entity32 before getting her big break when she was scouted by a fashion photographer in the 1990s			0
her career as a supermodel went from strength to strength and she starred in @entity7 campaigns and even made a cameo appearance in @entity10 movie , @entity41			1
but her life was fickle			0
‘ i thought , “ this is b * * * * * t , fake			0
i could n’t sleep one more night knowing the truth about what was happening to girls , ’ she told @entity43			0
and that ’s when she decided to speak up			0
in a candid interview with @entity50 at the height of her fame in 1997 , @entity1 revealed her dark past whereby she was subjected to @entity14 and left to recover in a makeshift shelter under a tree for several days			1
she has since set about saving other young girls from enduring what she suffered			0
she has since been appointed a @entity59 special ambassador and set up her own charity , @entity60 , to help protect girls against the practice , which involves partial or total removal of the external female genitalia for non-medical reasons			2
the practice – which many believe leaves a girl ‘ clean ’ in preparation for her marriage - usually happens before girls reach the age of fifteen but can be performed on babies at birth too			0
it causes intense pain , risk of infection and can even lead to fatal childbirth later in life			0
despite being illegal in the @entity86 , @entity14 is on the rise with an estimated 66,000 women dealing with the after - effects and more than 20,000 young girls thought to be at risk			1
worldwide , more than three million women have been subjected to @entity14 , many of whom come from @entity96 countries such as @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity25			1
rudimentary tools are often used to perform the operations , like these found in @entity98 ( pictured left )			0
the procedure is often performed on young girls like nine - year - old @entity103 ( pictured right )			2
those countries , many of which are part of the @entity108 , are at the heart of @entity86 's @entity14 problem , and as a result , the majority of @entity86 women to suffer @entity14 are part of the @entity86 's 600,000 - strong ethnic @entity96 community			1
when people fled from @entity118 in @entity25 or @entity119 in @entity97 , many came to the @entity86 - bringing with them local traditions , including @entity14			1
despite being illegal in the @entity86 , @entity14 is on the rise with an estimated 66,000 women dealing with the after - effects and more than 20,000 young girls thought to be at risk but @entity96 is n't the only place where the practice is widespread			1
women in @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and others are also highly likely to be forced to undergo @entity14			2
‘ if a white man or woman saw a white child that is mutilated , there would be screaming			2
i guarantee it would end			0
this is abuse against a child , so to say it ’s to do with your religion or race , it ’s all wrong			0
this is about child protection , ' said @entity1			1
@entity1 wants the issue to be debated on tv , in the media and by politicians and maintains that , by having it out in the open , we can fight it			2
her campaign work is endless			0
last month she opened the first medical centre in @entity155 that will offer fgm sufferers reconstructive surgery and she hopes to roll this initiative out to @entity98 , @entity159 , the @entity160 and @entity161			1

baroness @entity179 , president of @entity180 , said : ' @entity1 is a very worthy recipient of this @entity182 award			2
her astonishing bravery and commitment to this cause has brought this horrific crime against girls and women to the world ’s attention			0
' she provides hope and inspiration to victims that one day this abhorrent practice will be eradicated			0
' ' i ca n't turn back , not now i 'm almost there			0
you just have to keep going until one day it will come to an end , ' added @entity1			2
