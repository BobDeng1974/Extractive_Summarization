by @entity0 for two years , cerebral palsy sufferer @entity1 dreamt of the life - changing operation that would one day let him play football with his little brother			1
then , after the nine - year - old had endured gruelling preparation for the surgery , his dream was shattered by the @entity11 cancelling the operation just weeks before it was due			1
his mother @entity13 had to break the news to him after receiving a letter from @entity16 in @entity17 which blamed the cancellation on cuts which had made the £ 20,000 surgery ‘ unfundable ’ by the @entity11			1
@entity20 from @entity21 , @entity23 - under - @entity22 , @entity24 , with her nine year old boy @entity25 who has @entity26			0
the @entity11 have pulled out of funding for an operation @entity25 needs so the family are trying to raise the £ 11,400 themselves ‘ when i told him , he was completely devastated , ’ mrs @entity20 said			1
he just wanted to kick a ball with his brother without being in agony			0
’ @entity25 had already taught himself to walk , but his disability means it is painful for him and over time his mobility will deteriorate , leaving him wheelchair - bound and unable to play with brother @entity39 , five			2
mrs @entity20 , 29 , added : ‘ for the past two years , we ’ve been told by doctors that @entity25 was on the list for the operation and we had to prepare for the surgery			2
when i received that letter i felt like i had let my little boy down			0
@entity25 has already taught himself to walk , but his disability means it is painful for him and over time his mobility will deteriorate , leaving him wheelchair - bound and unable to play with brother @entity39 , five ‘ it ’s a particular blow to us that the @entity11 would cut back on operations , which could give children like @entity25 a brighter future , while still shelling out for people ’s gastric bands and boob jobs			1
’ the family from @entity21 in @entity24 have been helping @entity25 prepare for the operation since 2012 , and now plan to take legal action against @entity58 for cancelling at such short notice			0
the family from @entity21 in @entity24 have been helping @entity25 prepare for the operation since 2012 , and now plan to take legal action against @entity58 ahead of the surgery , @entity25 had already undergone an hour - long mri scan under general anaesthetic and had stopped his regular @entity65 injections which help ease his muscle stiffness			1
when families were made aware of the cuts earlier this year , the @entity11 promised to honour any operations that had been given a date			1
@entity25 ’s pre-operation baclofen procedure , which helps with muscle spasms , had been booked but because his final surgery had not been scheduled , the trust cancelled the first procedure – leaving the family to foot the bill for both that and the main operation on the nerves in his spine			2
mrs @entity20 and her husband @entity82 , a 37 - year - old welder , now need to raise £ 11,400 for the operation to be done privately			2
@entity84 , clinical director for the musculoskeletal directorate at @entity58 , said : ‘ we have been in contact with parents of children referred to @entity58 to inform them we will not be proceeding with any further pre-operative tests			0
‘ it would be unfair on these children and their families for us to continue a process which may not result in surgery			0
’ around 5,400 gastric bypasses and 1,300 gastric band procedures are performed by the @entity11 each year , while in 2012 it spent £ 3.5million on 790 breast implant operations			0
