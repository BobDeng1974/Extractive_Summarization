by @entity0 published : 05:58 est , 7 july 2013 updated : 09:52 est , 7 july 2013 a lifelong smoker keen to quit has taken drastic measures to kick the habit - he has locked his head in a cage which prevents him from putting a cigarette in his mouth			1
@entity8 is so unsure of his own willpower that he entrusts the keys to the bizarre contraption to his family so he is not tempted to release himself			2
the @entity14 man was inspired by another successful health campaign - the safety helmets worn by motorbike riders			1
however , since his father died of lung cancer , he has been desperate to quit for the good of his health and his family			0
he has made several attempts to give up , but has always returned to the habit despite his efforts			0
fitting : mr @entity8 's daughter attaches the cage to her father 's head as she goes out to work @entity39 : the 42 - year - old was inspired by the designed of motorbike safety helmets so mr @entity8 , from the western province of @entity43 , designed the helmet , similar to a birdcage , which prevents him from smoking a cigarette at all			1
every morning he heads off to work wearing the elaborate device - and he takes extra measures to stop himself from opening it and sneaking a smoke			0
he leaves the keys to the cage with his wife and his children , meaning there is no way he can break his vow to himself			0
out and about : mr @entity8 has attracted more than his fair share of funny looks from neighbours au naturel : mr @entity8 pictured when he is not wearing his unique anti-smoking contraption the family was initially dubious about his slightly ridiculous get - up , but after a few days they realised that the plan might just be the thing to help him give up at last			1
however , not all mr @entity8 's neighbours have got used to the sight of his head encased in metal			2
@entity73 footage shows him walking around his local area followed by young children , entranced by the unusual spectacle .			0
