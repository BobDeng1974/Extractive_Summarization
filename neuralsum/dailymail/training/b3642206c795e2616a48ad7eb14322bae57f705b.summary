their family pictured above the one that got away : @entity2 ( left ) dated @entity30 actor @entity8 ( right ) for four years in the early 90s , but the two broke up just before she landed a part on friends ' he would not approve of all this uninvited attention , ' said @entity34 of @entity8 in an interview with the @entity36 as part of her aggressive push to grab an @entity40 nomination for her role in the film cake , @entity2 said of @entity8 , who she dated in her early twenties : ' he would have been " the one "			1
but i was 25 and i was stupid			0
' she went on to say ; ' he must have sent me @entity47 to make up for it all			0
' this in reference to the actress ' current fiancé , @entity50			0
@entity6 took to @entity52 after seeing @entity2 's interview and said ; ' i am very upset that the media is exploiting @entity8 ’s memory in connection to @entity2			1
' what is precious shines in our hearts and should not be splayed for everyone ’s consumption in the media this way			0
' she then goes after @entity2 , saying ; ' why now ? i wonder			2
after decades of stardom , she is media savvy enough to know that any casual comment she makes becomes front page tabloid news			1
@entity2 is @entity2 , and that means that anything that she says about her love life to any journalist , even someone as reputable as @entity36 ’ @entity74 , will be later dissected and exploited			2
' @entity2 has yet to respond to these comments			1
@entity34 - @entity34 then adds : ' it pains me to read the headlines that allude to her losing him tragically when she was not present during his long and difficult illness			1
' she also reveals that she reached out to @entity2 after @entity8 died to see if the actress wanted any photos he had of the two back , but she never responded			1
@entity34 and @entity8 were married until his death in 2007 big relationships : @entity2 would go on to become engaged to actor @entity50 ( left ) and was previously married to @entity86 ( right ) as for @entity8 , @entity88 , who married @entity89 in september 2014 , says , ' he would not approve of all this uninvited attention			1
' ‘ @entity2 never stopped loving @entity8 , but things were happening very fast with her career by that time – it was just a year before she landed friends , ' a source previously revealed to @entity96			1
' she ’d moved to @entity97 , and @entity8 stayed on in @entity98 and was doing @entity30			2
‘ after @entity99 and @entity2 split , she went on to date and become engaged to actor @entity100 , but i do n’t think she ever got over letting @entity99 slip through her fingers			2
’ added the source ; ‘ @entity8 was a lovely guy			2
he was open , honest and funny , and i know @entity2 really loved him			2
the timing was just off for them i guess			0
' in light of what ’s been happening around the world , this may seem like a very trivial and superficial post			0
this past 24 hours have been very difficult for me …			0
. i am very upset that the media is exploiting @entity8 ’s memory in connection to @entity2			1
what is precious shines in our hearts and should not be splayed for everyone ’s consumption in the media this way			0
why now ? i wonder			0
after decades of stardom , she is media savvy enough to know that any casual comment she makes becomes front page tabloid news			1
@entity2 is @entity2 , and that means that anything that she says about her love life to any journalist , even someone as reputable as @entity36 ’ @entity74 , will be later dissected and exploited			0
my heart aches to see our tragedy of losing @entity8 to serve the media ’s hunger for sensationalism			2
i remember how journalists often called our home to ask @entity8 for information about @entity2 , and being the gentleman that he was , he would always decline to comment on anything at all			1
i imagine he would be appalled to be caught up in this media circus , especially after he had found @entity142 and built a family of his own			0
his love is part of our fabric -- part of me , part of @entity149 , part of @entity151			0
please respect our love and especially our loss			0
the children lost their father			0
i am sorry that @entity2 did not realize the treasure that was @entity8 when she had the chance , long before he and i met and long before he died			1
it pains me to read the headlines that allude to her losing him tragically when she was not present during his long and difficult illness			1
that said perhaps @entity8 ’s gift was to teach her how to love and appreciate @entity50			0
i know how much @entity8 cared about her , and how protective he was of her			0
that was part of what i loved about him			0
i find it very hard to believe that she may not have married @entity86 had @entity8 and i not married months before as some unnamed “ sources ” declared to the @entity168 on line			1
after @entity8 died , i reached out to her to give her back all the photographs from the time they were together			2
i never got an answer back from her			0
please ignore the gossip and remember what is essential ; the music in @entity8 ’s heart lingers on in us , in his dear friends , his mother @entity189 , his siblings who miss him every day , his cousins , his nieces and nephews , his colleagues , his fans , his children , and me .			2
