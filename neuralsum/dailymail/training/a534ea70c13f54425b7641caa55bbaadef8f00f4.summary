despite a pledge by the president to work with families of hostages and do anything to try and find them , @entity9 and @entity10 claim he has never spoken to them about the disappearance of their son @entity18 and the only certain thing they have is that they have no idea where he is			1
@entity23 was last heard from in august 2012 near @entity24 as he took photos to report on the conflict for a number of news organisations			1
' that line of communication has primarily been one way , ' mrs @entity10 told @entity38			0
she said officials were keen for them to share any information they receive , but said communication back from them ' has been exquisitely horrible , honestly			2
' the couple have struggled with the normal approach to keep a low media profile that officials believe can captives safer , and have instead done publicity campaigns in the hope that the @entity50 may take more action			1
the former @entity52 was in the region reporting for @entity54 , the @entity55 , @entity56 and others when he was taken			1

mr @entity8 said : ' it 's as tough as anything that i do -- having conversations with parents who understandably want , by any means necessary , for their children to be safe			2
' we will do everything we can short of providing an incentive for future @entity2 to be caught			0
' footage of a man who appeared to be @entity18 surfaced in september 2012			0
in a crudely shot video , a group of armed men lead a blindfolded @entity2 up a rocky hillside , where he makes statements in broken @entity88 before becoming too distressed to carry on			0
@entity8 said this week that the government would do everything possible to try and find hostages the @entity52 was reporting for @entity54 , the @entity55 and @entity56 when he was taken the identity of the man has n't been confirmed , but friends of @entity18 believe it is him			1
