@entity0 once flowed beneath the surface of @entity2 - and the warmer , wetter ancient planet could have been considerably more hospitable for life			1
scans by spectrometers on board the @entity8 and @entity9 have revealed 175 outcrops in @entity2 's @entity12 mountains that are unmistakably ' weathered ' by water			1
the rocks , found in craters , seem to have been ' carved ' out from beneath the crust by asteroid impacts - and offer an insight into the planet 's history , and what lies beneath the surface			1
the find proves water flowed beneath the surface of @entity2 for a ' long period ' , say the researchers			1
scans by spectrometers on board the @entity8 and @entity9 have revealed 175 outcrops in @entity2 's @entity12 mountains that are unmistakably ' weathered ' by water the find of 175 outcrops with weathered minerals in a region of ancient highlands , @entity12 , could reveal more about the planet 's mysterious history today , atmospheric pressure is so low on @entity2 that surface water can not exist on its surface			1
however , studies made by orbiting spacecraft and surface rovers show that @entity2 was once much warmer and wetter than it is today			1
the find of 175 outcrops with weathered minerals in a region of ancient highlands , @entity12 , could reveal more about the planet 's mysterious history			1
the spacecraft observations revealed hydrated silicate - bearing outcrops at 175 different sites in @entity12 , almost all of which are associated with ecrater walls and rims , and central uplifts inside craters			2
although the region is dissected by numerous valley networks , rocks altered by water are rarely visible between the craters in @entity12			2
this implies that the chemical weathering revealed by the craters was not associated with weathering by liquid water at the surface			1
‘ these minerals are associated with fresh craters that happened after activity caused by water , ’ said @entity63 , an @entity64 and lead author of the study			0
‘ they probably represent ancient hydrated terrains that have been excavated by the crater - forming impacts			1
these impacts have revealed the composition of the @entity78 crust , which was chemically weathered more than 3.7 billion years ago			0
’ their preferred explanation is that the hydrated minerals were formed underground in the presence of ground water			0
the rocks , found in craters , seem to have been ' carved ' out from beneath the crust by asteroid impacts - and offer an insight into the planet 's history , and what lies beneath the surface			1
the buried hydrated silicate - bearing rocks were then exposed and exhumed by later impacts			0
these impacts transported the hydrated minerals mechanically , without significant mineralogical transformations			0
the presence of a few phyllosilicate - bearing outcrops on a few buttes in the region , far from visible craters , also reinforces the idea that the crust has been broadly altered , not only around craters			0
phyllosilicates are hydrous minerals formed by interaction between rock and liquid water			0
this important group of minerals includes the micas , chlorite , serpentine , talc and clays - primary products of chemical weathering of rocks			0
the minerals form at different temperatures and seem to be located at different depths , consistent with temperatures of up to 300 degrees @entity122 a few kilometres beneath the surface			2
the presence of hydrated silicates on larger craters of the smooth plains can be explained by excavation : the lava plain is thin enough for larger craters to excavate rocks underneath , from the buried @entity78 unit			0
hence , hydrated silicate - bearing craters in volcanic plains illustrate the variation in plain thickness and excavation by impacts of buried hydrated rocks			0
‘ the large range of crater sizes studied , from less than 1 km to 84 km wide , indicates that these hydrated silicates are were excavated from depths of tens of metres to kilometres , ’ said @entity63			0
‘ the composition of the rocks is such that underground water must have been present there here for a long period of time in order to have altered their chemistry			0
’ ‘ water circulation occurred several kilometres deep in the crust some 3.7 billion years ago , before the majority of craters formed herein this region , ’ said co-author @entity152 , from the @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155			2
‘ the water generated resulted in a wide range of chemical changes in the rocks that reflect low temperatures near the surface to high temperatures at depth , but without any a direct relationship to the surface conditions at the that time			2
’ ‘ the role of liquid water on @entity2 is of great importance for its habitability and this study using data from @entity8 describes a very large zone where groundwater was present for a long time , ’ said @entity171 , @entity64 's @entity8 project scientist .			1
