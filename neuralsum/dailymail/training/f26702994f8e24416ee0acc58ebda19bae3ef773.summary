@entity1 should leave the @entity2 unless it changes , @entity0 has warned			1
the home secretary said politicians who argue that the @entity1 is better off in the @entity2 ' whatever the terms , are wrong '			1
ranging beyond her law and order brief – in a move likely to fuel speculation about her leadership ambitions – mrs may also warned red tape and regulations from @entity15 is holding back the @entity1 economy			1
home secretary @entity0 has warned @entity1 can not stay in the @entity2 at any cost mrs may faces a major test in the @entity19 tomorrow when she urges @entity21 mps not to vote against plans to sign @entity1 up to the @entity23			1
she insisted that the way it operates now is ' fairer ' but it is still ' every bit as effective when it comes to protecting the public from serious crime and terrorism '			0
but writing in the @entity32 , mrs may made a wider plea for major reforms to the way the @entity2 operates to work in the @entity1 's interests			1
she said : ' while access to the world 's biggest single market is in our national interest , the @entity2 's rules and regulations hold back not just our economy , but also the economies of every other member state			1
that is why we need to argue for changes that make the @entity2 more competitive , more outward - looking and more open to global trade			1
' these are the reasons i believe that the politicians who argue that we are better off in the @entity2 , whatever the terms , are wrong			1
but i also believe that the politicians who argue that we are better off out , whatever the terms , are also wrong			1
' because if we can make @entity57 work differently - if we can work towards a more flexible union of sovereign member states who use treaties and institutions to trade freely and co-operate in the fight against crime and terrorism - it will surely be in our national interest to remain members of the @entity2			1
' @entity67 has promised to renegotiate @entity1 's membership of the @entity2 before holding an in - out referendum by 2017 @entity67 's ' nods and winks ' that he might back @entity1 leaving the @entity2 is putting the nation 's future prosperity in danger , @entity70 claims			1
the @entity77 leader will use a speech to the @entity79 tomorrow to warn the @entity1 is being left increasingly isolated and is now on a ' conveyor belt towards exit with no idea how to get off '			0
he will also pledge not to play ' political games ' with @entity1 's @entity2 membership and insist @entity77 has a credible and clear plan to secure reforms			2
he will say : ' there are some people in our country who advocate exit from the @entity2			2
there are others who flirt with it , thinking they can do so without consequence			0
' giving succour to the argument that the real answer is leaving the @entity2 , or contemplating it , simply drags us closer to exit			2
' and every nod and wink to those who want to leave sends a message to potential investors in our country that we are not open for business			0
' it is a betrayal of our national interest			0
it is a clear and present danger to our future prosperity			0
' the way to overcome these false solutions is not to pander to them			0
not to posture about finding ways of accommodating them			0
not to make promises everyone knows you can not keep			2
' mrs may also issued a direct plea for mps to back the @entity23			1
' if we want to stop foreign criminals from coming to @entity1 , deal with @entity57 fighters coming back from @entity127 , stop @entity1 criminals evading justice abroad , prevent foreign criminals evading justice by hiding here , and get foreign criminals out of our prisons , these measures are vital			0
' tomorrow evening , the @entity135 should vote to give the police , prosecutors and other law enforcement agencies the powers they need to keep us safe			2
' @entity21 backbencher @entity141 accused mrs may of ' scaremongering ' with her claims the @entity23 ( @entity145 ) would lead to @entity1 becoming a ' honeypot ' for fugitives			2
the @entity21 leadership face a revolt from dozens of @entity122 , who could defy the party leadership to oppose the measure because of concerns that it is too easy for @entity1 citizens to be extradited on relatively minor charges to countries where they may have no guarantee of a fair trial			0
writing in the @entity160 mr @entity141 said : ' it is better to take a few weeks longer to return a terrorist to @entity1 justice than to take three years longer to recover a @entity1 citizen from a foreign injustice			0
' the warnings that @entity1 will become a safe haven for criminals is an example of the sort of scaremongering that has become far too prevalent in the debates on justice and anti-terrorism measures			0
' the @entity1 was certainly no safe haven prior to the introduction of the @entity23			2
' the controversial power is one of 35 @entity2 police and criminal justice measures the government wants to opt back in to , with mps expected to vote on the package as a whole			1
@entity67 has promised to renegotiate @entity1 's membership of the @entity2 before holding an in - out referendum by 2017			1
efforts to secure concessions from @entity15 were undermined by a shock demand for an extra £ 1.7billion from @entity1 last month			2
on friday chancellor @entity189 boasted that he had halved the bill to £ 850million			0
but critics accused him of ' smoke and mirrors ' , by bringing forward a rebate payment from 2015 which was always going to be paid			0
