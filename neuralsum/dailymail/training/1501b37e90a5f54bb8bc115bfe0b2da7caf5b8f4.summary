it 's the one topic @entity2 prime minister @entity1 has been trying to steer well away from during this weekend 's @entity4 summit			1
but with temperatures in @entity7 set to hit a scorching 41 degrees @entity8 ( 105.8 degrees @entity9 ) it seems that the topic of climate change will be unavoidable			1
world leaders and their staffers will be forced to put up with the near - record heat , but police are especially worried about how the sweltering weather will affect protesters and the thousands of police manning the city streets on sunday			1
' we 'll just have to manage that as best we can , but we certainly could have done without a 40 degree day , ' mr @entity38 said			0
the heat wave is being driven by northwesterly winds , which could also pose a problem for firefighters who are battling a number of blazes across the state			0
@entity7 's november record of 41.2 degrees dates back to 1913			0
sunday 's temperature is expected to fall just short of that			0
this comes after @entity27 president @entity26 gave a landmark speech at the @entity55 on saturday where he called for immediate action on climate change			2
swimmers cool off at @entity60 in @entity7 on sunday after soared throughout south - east @entity61 a @entity63 volunteer pours a bottle of water over his head temperatures are set to hit near - record levels of 41 degrees @entity8 ( 105.8 degrees @entity9 ) on sunday some members of the public chose to stay hydrated by eating ice blocks mr @entity26 piled pressure on the @entity1 government to act on emissions , declaring that natural wonders such as the @entity76 were under direct threat from climate change			1
the @entity27 president said today that no country was immune to the effects of climate change and that everyone must play a role in fighting the global phenomena			2
' i want my daughters to be able to come back and i want them to be able to bring their daughters or sons to visit , ' he told an audience at the @entity91 to loud applause			0
' i want that there 50 years from now			0
' while the @entity2 government has attempted to keep the focus of the @entity98 leaders ' summit on economic growth and jobs , mr @entity26 steered the focus back to climate change , following a historic @entity27 deal with @entity23 to slash emissions			1
while @entity2 has not made climate change a formal part of the 2014 @entity4 agenda , the final communique is expected to call on leaders to make clear their new carbon emission reduction targets before the @entity112 climate summit in december 2015			2
protesters march through the streets of @entity7 on saturday police are especially worried about how the sweltering weather will affect protesters and the thousands of officers manning the @entity7 city streets on sunday @entity121 prime minister @entity120 also urged mr @entity1 to take out more insurance against climate change even if he does n't believe in the threat			1
mr @entity120 told @entity121 's @entity125 on saturday that at the next climate change talks in @entity112 every country had to bring something more to the table			2
' but obviously countries that have so far done the least need to think about what more they can do and i 've had good and friendly conversations with prime minister @entity1 about that			0
' when asked if mr @entity1 's scrapping of the carbon tax and cuts to renewable energy went against the trend of climate change action , mr @entity120 said @entity2 had set a cut in carbon emissions of some 5 per cent			1
he said the @entity2 government saw that as an actual cut of 19 per cent if @entity2 had carried on with business as usual			0
mr @entity26 addresses an audience at the @entity91 on saturday mr @entity1 greets @entity121 's prime minister @entity120 at @entity28 in @entity7 ' i hope they 'll do everything they can in the coming months to look at what more they can deliver because when it comes to @entity112 , if you want to get a global agreement , everyone 's going to have to bring something to the table			1
' mr @entity120 said it made sense to insure against climate change			2
' i always say , think about it like insurance , even if you do n't believe in the nature of this threat , is n't it better to insure against it ? ' you might think there 's only a 10 per cent chance of your house burning down but even if it 's that percentage chance would n't you do something to try and make sure you can save your world , your environment for your children and your grandchildren ? ' mr @entity120 said he had already had that conversation with mr @entity1 .			0
