what two things do @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 have in common ? one , they have all been relegated from the @entity5			1
two , they have all scored more goals in @entity9 tournaments than @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			1
on the stretch : papa @entity0 has scored more @entity9 goals than @entity10 and @entity11 time to shine ! @entity11 ( left ) and @entity10 are the world 's best two players and must deliver on the biggest stage @entity10 - 571 minutes , 1 goal ( 2006 + 2010 ) ronaldo - 754 minutes , two goals ( 2006 + 2010 ) @entity12 - 595 minutes , 0 goals ( 2006 + 2010 ) despite seeming to smash a goalscoring record every other week in @entity23 or the @entity24 , both @entity11 and @entity10 have failed to sparkle in the last two @entity25 , while @entity12 has fallen foul of his own ill indiscipline and poor fitness			1
the trio have played 1,920 minutes ( 32 hours ) of @entity9 football between them but have collectively found the net just three times during that time			2
@entity0 , in comparison , played in just one @entity9 - but what a @entity9 it was			2
a colossus in midfield for @entity37 on their debut on the world stage in 2002 , he was responsible for one of the biggest shocks in @entity9 history when he scored the only goal in a 1 - 0 win over the then - holders @entity46 in the opening game			2
two goals in their third group game , a thrilling 3 - 3 draw with @entity52 , took his tally for the tournament to three but his hopes of adding to that were thwarted by @entity37 failing to qualify for 2006 and 2010			0
will this time be different ? @entity12 has n't performed for @entity57 at a major tournament since 2004 have that ! @entity60 striker @entity2 scored for @entity61 against @entity62 in 2002 sneaking in : @entity63 's @entity1 nets beyond @entity65 's @entity64 during the home 2002 finals then there ’s @entity1			1
a former team - mate of @entity12 ’s at @entity71 , the @entity69 was one of the poster boys of the 2002 @entity9 in the @entity74 and he did not disappoint			0
he scored once during @entity76 ’s sides run to the semi-final , where they were eventually beaten by @entity79			0
he added further strikes at the 2006 and 2010 @entity25			0
@entity57 ’s @entity81 oppponents @entity61 would love to still have @entity2 in their side			0
the @entity84 legend was a mainstay for the national side between 1996 and 2008 , appearing at two @entity25 during that time			0
he scored against the big names too , in a 5 - 2 defeat against the eventual champions in 2002 , @entity62 , and then twice against @entity79 in the group stages four years later			0
@entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 have laboured their way through the last two tournaments but with all three firing on all cylinders in qualifying , scoring 10 , eight and seven respectively , perhaps that disappointing form in @entity25 is about to change			1
other surprise names that have outfired @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 on the biggest stage : @entity99 ( 5 ) @entity100 – @entity101 ( 4 ) @entity102 – @entity65 ( 4 ) @entity103 – @entity104 ( 3 ) @entity105 ( 3 ) @entity106 – @entity107 ( 3 ) @entity108 – @entity109 ( 3 ) struggling : @entity111 's @entity110 winner @entity11 is n't fully fit for @entity65 ahead of this month			1

@entity114 striker @entity2 has also found the net more often
former @entity117 man @entity1 found the net for @entity63
@entity10 has only ever scored one @entity9 goal
meanwhile @entity12 has failed to score in a @entity9
@entity11 's @entity9 scoring record is almost just as bad with only two goals to his name from two tournaments
papa @entity0 has only played in one @entity9 , but nonetheless *boasts* a record as good as @entity11 , @entity10 and @entity12 put together
