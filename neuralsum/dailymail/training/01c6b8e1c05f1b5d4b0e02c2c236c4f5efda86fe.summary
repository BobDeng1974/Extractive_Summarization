by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson when former @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 coach @entity2 begins work as @entity8 's new coach he will face the task of carrying out the biggest overhaul of the team since his pal @entity12 took charge in 2008			1
the size of the job was made clear by the fact that the first player of the @entity2 era had already been signed before the man who played for @entity3 during the last eight seasons of his career had even been officially presented			1
@entity23 ’s arrival was announced at the same time as the new manager ’s			2
the 22 - year - old keeper signed from @entity26 will come in for @entity27 who joins @entity28			1
but the signings will not stop there			0
@entity38 ’s great pal has shown in the run - in that he no longer has what it takes in times of emergency and the new manager will study a list of options that include @entity52 ’s @entity51 , @entity54 ’s @entity53 , @entity56 ’s @entity55 and @entity58 ’s @entity57			0
the latter two might end up at @entity60 if , as expected , they lose @entity61 back to @entity62			0
@entity63 will join @entity27 and @entity40 in the cull			1
his move to @entity66 is all but sealed and one of @entity2 ’s most difficult jobs will be replacing the @entity70 right - back who arrived in 2008 coinciding with the greatest era in the club ’s history			1
a new right back will definitely be needed because there is little belief in the b - team 's @entity77 who may also be sold this summer			0
in the centre of defence there are even bigger problems			0
@entity84 is irreplaceable … but he will need replacing all the same			0
@entity85 certainly has the hair for it			2
he also has the chaotic , occasionally calamitous style that @entity84 showed earlier in his career			0
moving on : @entity63 ( centre ) looks set to join @entity91 side @entity66 this summer option : @entity2 could make a move for @entity58 keeper @entity57 , who spent last season on loan at @entity96 @entity3 ’s outgoing captain is very close pals with @entity2 so it may well be that the man himself advises on who @entity3 should bring in			1
@entity102 ’s @entity101 and @entity104 ’s @entity103 are also being looked at as new recruits for the centre of a defence that conceded soft goals all season right down to that @entity110 header that finally lost @entity8 the league			2
@entity112 and @entity113 are the players @entity8 would really like to bring in but both have no intention of leaving their current clubs , no matter how much money @entity3 can find to throw their way			1
in midfield @entity120 was sold to @entity3 fans as someone who could play in the centre of defence or in midfield			2
the former was plainly never true and he has never been given the chance to demonstrate the latter			0
@entity2 is understood not to be a fan , preferring @entity131 who has already been recalled from his loan spell at @entity5 where he played under the new boss			1
@entity8 are also talking up interest in @entity135 though they accept @entity136 are unlikely to sell			1
@entity137 is another target but @entity139 might have other ideas			0
@entity2 is understood to be upset the club sold @entity142 – the brother of @entity131 – to @entity143 and will look for a similar option if he can find it from inside @entity146			2
wanted man : @entity8 would love to sign @entity148 captain @entity112 but a move looks unlikely @entity150 : @entity136 midfielder @entity135 ( right ) is on @entity3 's summer wishlist to fund the overhaul at least one big name player will have to be sold			1
@entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 are all available at the right price			0
none of them will leave for so much as a euro less than @entity3 want for them , and @entity154 ’ suitors have already been told that it will take £ 45million to get him , and it ’s also clear they wo n’t all leave			1
but for @entity8 to bring in as many players as they want to they will have to sell at least one top earner			2
@entity156 is the most likely of the three to eventually move on			0
@entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 will also be shown the door to make way for returning loanees such as @entity173 who returns to play for his former @entity3 team boss			1
@entity175 could sign 18 - year - old @entity176 on loan to fill the gap , he is another @entity8 youngster who would benefit from @entity180 experience			1
return ? the @entity37 giants could decide to cash in on @entity154 , with @entity182 interested in the midfielder going home : @entity185 ( left ) will return to @entity3 after spending last season on loan with @entity175 it used to be that @entity188 worked so well that there was no need for a @entity191 but in meetings with sporting director @entity193 , @entity2 has already made it clear he wants a big centre - forward who can offer solutions when all else fails			1
@entity198 has been discussed although as with @entity136 would be reluctant to sell			0
the new manager will also sit down with @entity200 and @entity201			0
such is the huge respect for these two players they will only go if they decide to			0
neither can be assured a first - team place in the new @entity3 and so if @entity200 is tempted by an @entity207 adventure and @entity201 fancies @entity208 or a @entity180 swansong they will be allowed to move on			1
and when all the ins and outs are sorted @entity2 has the minor job or resurrecting @entity38			2
he signed his £ 16.3m contract on monday but the four - times @entity215 winner has looked a shadow of his former self			2
it will be new man ’s biggest challenge to make him shine again			0
full name : @entity2 born : may 8 , 1970 in @entity221			2
1989 - 91 : came to the fore in his second season at @entity221 and helped them qualify for the @entity227 @entity226			0

coaching 2008 - 11 : @entity3 coach and oversaw promotion to the @entity37 second division			1
2011 - 12 : a disappointing time at @entity4 saw him leave after a season with the team finishing seventh in @entity208 2013 - 14 : praised for @entity5 's attacking football and for finishing in the top half of the table			0
may 2014 : appointed as @entity3 coach to replace @entity252 who left after a year in charge with the team failing to lift any of the major trophies .			1
