by @entity0 for @entity1 a man who feared he would have to sell his ' wonderland ' home because he lost his job has taken it off the market after strangers donated thousands of pounds to his cause			1
on first glance , @entity11 's former council house in a quiet cul - de - sac in @entity13 , @entity14 , looks nothing special			1
but on the inside mr @entity11 has transformed it into the extraordinary , with different rooms designed to reflect a different time and place in history - including a 1950s @entity24 kitchen , @entity26 dining room , @entity28 bedroom , @entity30 tree - house loft and @entity32 edwardian hall			1
after spending almost 25 years and £ 700,000 on the home , he was forced to put it on the market for just £ 350,000 because he could not afford the £ 2,000 - a - month upkeep after being made redundant			1
his home , called @entity48 and @entity49 , has more than 1,650 objects , costing around £ 500,000 altogether			1
the other £ 200,000 spent on the house paid for building materials mr @entity11 opens up his ' wonderland ' home for visitors ' tours , as well as photoshoots and murder mystery nights			1
the home includes this 1950s @entity24 kitchen the @entity26 dining room is fortified with stone walls , which had to be lifted in by crane , and the tree - house in the loft is supported by a real trunk			1
the smells have been engineered too - nutmeg and coffee waft through the @entity24 kitchen whilst jasmine fills the tree - house air			1
even the sounds have been tweaked to help muster the right mood - and visitors quickly forget outside is suburban @entity14			2
but the £ 2,000 a month costs , which include the mortgage , insurance and general upkeep , became unaffordable when mr @entity11 , 49 , lost his job on a magazine earlier this year			1
he was forced to put the house up for sale in june , but set up an online fundraising site in the hope other people would share his passion for @entity87 - @entity88 for ‘ secret place in the woods ’			2
he was in luck , with strangers donating £ 6,000 to his cause - enough for the delighted homeowner to take the property off the market			1
mr @entity11 said : ' i 'm just emotionally exhausted			2
it 's been such a rollercoaster ride but there 's been so much positivity and it really shows how important @entity87 is , how much people love it			0
' @entity87 is the thing i would hold above my head if i was drowning			0
it affects so many people in such a positive way and i needed to do whatever it took			0
some people think it ’s totally mad but others say it ’s like being in one of those novels where a secret door opens up to a different world and fall in love with it			0
' @entity122 foliage and bright - coloured lights fill the fountain courtyard , which was almost sold along with the house but was saved by donations from strangers from the outside , the three bedroom property looks unremarkable , but inside it has been transformed into a ' wonderland ' emotionally exhausted : mr @entity11 , 49 , said the past two months had been a ' rollercoaster ride ' and that the donations show how much people love his house more than 1,650 objects from 27 countries fill the incredible home , which he bought in 1990 for £ 73,000 , with the artefacts costing him £ 500,000			1
@entity11 , who lives in the house alone , spent a further £ 200,000 on building materials , and says he has spent ' every penny ' in the last 24 years on his labour of love			1
‘ i ’ve always been interested in @entity88 history but being from an ordinary @entity145 of @entity147 family , i was never going to afford the sort of house i wanted , ’ mr @entity11 said			2
‘ it ’s every penny i ’ve had for last 24 years – and every weekend @entity151 was into writing speculative fiction at the time – fantasy , horror and science fiction – so originally the idea was to have a place i could write			0
‘ i picked the most normal house			0
i did n’t want character because i knew i was going to start from scratch			0
in fact , it was hideous – the bathroom leaked , it had everything wrong with it and it would n’t sell			0
i thought , “ perfect ! ” i started with the office and then moved onto the bathroom and have gone on from there			0
’ quite a transformation : the bedroom - now the ' room of dreams ' - before the renovation			2
mr @entity11 bought the council house for £ 73,000 in 1990 a shadow of things to come : this dingy kitchen is what welcomed @entity11 in 1990 when he moved into the worn out house			1
now it is an extraordinary ' wonderland ' mr @entity11 opens the house to visitors , and even hosts murder mystery nights and photoshoots			2
he holds them in the living and dining room , which is arguably his greatest achievement			2
the room took mr @entity11 four and half years to complete , with authentic stone walls which are a foot in depth and had to be lifted into place by a crane			1
the walls are defined with £ 4,600 worth of oak paneling and he then rendered them using limestone			0
an open fireplace , carved table , and velvet curtain complete the look			0
mr @entity11 said : ‘ to me , it ’s the perfect place for entertaining			0
people walk into the room and are transported to a different place			0
‘ i want @entity208 to be a centre of creativity			0
i want it to inspire people			0

@entity11 had to put the extraordinary @entity48 in @entity13 , @entity14 , on the market after losing his job
