by @entity0 published : 11:24 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 14:01 est , 14 october 2013 two proud parents with nine children under the age of seven have welcomed home the first of their new quintuplets - as they swear they did n't use fertility drugs to conceive them			1
@entity8 and @entity9 from @entity10 already had a seven - year - old daughter , a three - year - old son and one - year - old twin boys when they learned they were pregnant with five more babies			1
@entity8 gave birth to two boys and three girls at the @entity19 on september 6 , and this weekend , they brought home three of the newborns to a very excited welcoming committee			1
speaking with the today show , the parents shared their joy at having most of their family home			2
the couple now has nine children under the age of seven @entity34 : the couple , pictured with three - year - old @entity9 and one - year - old twins @entity37 and @entity38 , looked surprisingly relaxed as they said everyone is getting enough sleep and they are sticking to a schedule ' i wanted a large family , ' @entity8 said			1
' no one expects that overnight but i wanted a large family ... so this is just a blessing from @entity49			0
it 's a dream come true			0
' the couple hopes to bring another of the newborns home next week and the final baby - @entity56 , who was born weighing less than two pounds - the following week			1
' as a mother with nine children , you often think , " do i have enough love for all of them ? " ' @entity8 said			2
' i think that 's been my number one priority			0
i do n't want anyone to feel neglected or unloved			0
' their doctor had initially told the @entity67 that they were expecting four babies , before revealing that there were actually five			2
back home : three of the babies , who were born after 32 weeks on september 6 , have returned home to the family in @entity10			1
the other two babies will go home over the next two weeks when quintuplets are not all the same gender , they could be fraternal quintuplets or a mixture of identical and fraternal			1
fraternal quintuplets are conceived when five separate eggs are released by the mother and each egg is fertlized by a different sperm			2
but having quintuplets this way naturally is extremely rare			0
instead , quintuplets of different genders could be a mixture of fraternals and identicals			0
in identical twins or triplets , the mother releases an egg which is fertilized by one sperm before splitting to form identical twins or identical triplets			0
this means that the @entity9 quintuplets could have been formed in a number of ways			1
all could be from five separate eggs ( fraternal ) or from as few as two eggs ( a set of twins and a set of triplets ) , three eggs ( two sets of twins and another egg ) , three eggs with a different combination ( one set of twins and two other eggs ) , four eggs ( one set of twins and three other eggs ) or any similar combination			0
at 22 weeks of pregnancy , after they discovered they were expecting quintuplets , the family moved to suburban @entity124 for care from dr. @entity126 , a perinatologist and multiple - birth specialist			1
after spending her last trimester on bed rest , @entity8 gave birth after carrying the babies to 32 weeks - and nearly doubled the family in less than five minutes			1
each was delivered between 11.17am and 11.21am on friday , september 6			0
in keeping with family tradition , the babies ' names all start with the letter 'd ' : @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity56			0
they joined the @entity144 ' seven - year - old daughter , @entity145 , a three - year - old son , @entity9 , and one - year - old twin boys , @entity37 and @entity38			1
the mother did n't know the babies ' genders prior to birth , hospital officials said , and she announced ' boy ' or ' girl ' as each baby was presented to her in the delivery room			0
even though they already had twins and have other multiple births in their families , the couple was stunned			0
doctors said they chances of her carrying quintuplets was one in a couple of million			1
' we 're not shocked to have the twins , ' @entity9 told today			2
' we would n't have been that shocked to have had twins again , but we could have never expected this			0
' video source today making his entrance : @entity138 was the first of the quintuplets to arrive at 11.17am on friday september 6 tiny tot : @entity139 was the next boy to arrive one minute later - all weighed less than three pounds at birth here come the girls : @entity181 was the first sister born at 11:19am - their genders were not known prior to birth give me five : @entity141 was the next girl to be born , one minute after @entity181 under surveillance : @entity56 was the last of the quintuplets to be born at 11:21am - and although she has put on a pound since she was born , she is expected to return home in about two weeks growing : @entity9 and @entity188 with their four children , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity9 and @entity145 , before the quintuplets now the family is just trying to find out their normal routine , but the parents grinned as they said they think they 're already on track			1
' everything is going good and we 're all getting sleep and it 's working out amazingly well , ' @entity8 said			2
after the births , the family of 11 told the @entity202 that they have to make some adjustments			0
' we have a vehicle for the family right now , but we do n't have a vehicle for the five others , ' said mr @entity9 , who works as a field property manager			2
' there 's just so much to figure out			0
' the @entity9 quintuplets were the fifth set of out - of - state quints delivered at @entity213 in the past year .			1

@entity8 and @entity9 already had a 7 - year - old daughter , 3 - year - old son and one - year - old twin boys when they welcomed five babies on sept. 6
