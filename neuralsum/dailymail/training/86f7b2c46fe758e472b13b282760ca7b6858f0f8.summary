fear : @entity1 , 39 , suffers from venephobia - fear of developing varicose veins many women worry they will develop varicose veins as they age			1
very few , however , would rather lose their legs than have to look at the veins			1
but that is what happened to 39 - year - old @entity10 , whose phobia was so bad that she begged doctors to amputate her healthy legs			1
miss @entity1 pleaded with her gp to refer her for the operation because her fear of veins was triggering several panic attacks a day			1
she said the anxiety made life so difficult that she felt being confined to a wheelchair would be more bearable			0
however her gp turned down her request and she has now undergone therapy to help her manage her venephobia			1
@entity26 , a bank cashier from @entity27 , said : ‘ when it was refused i wished i could do it myself			0
’ she added : ‘ it ’s impossible to live hiding from your own legs and in the end i just thought i could be a better parent without them triggering anxiety all the time			2
’ the mother - of - three believes her phobia of veins may have been triggered by a botched attempt to remove a wobbly tooth when she was six			2
she recalls seeing the tooth dangle from what she thought was a vein and bursting into tears			0
she began panicking at the sight of veins , particularly her mother ’s varicose veins			1
varicose veins are swollen , dark blue veins , which are often lumpy and raised above the skin			1
they affect three in ten adults and women are more likely to develop them than men , especially if they are overweight or pregnant			2
miss @entity1 said : ‘ i would freeze and cry at the sight of them so my mother always knew to wear trousers so i did n’t get upset			0
’ but as she grew older miss @entity1 ’s phobia became worse			0
she began crossing the street to avoid older women in dresses that might reveal veins and avoided strenuous activities likely to make her own veins bulge			1
miss @entity1 said : ‘ drawing or swimming with my daughter was impossible because i would start to get anxious seeing the veins in my hands bulge			2
‘ at work i had to hold them up for the blood to drain down			0
’ but her phobia got more severe when she developed varicose veins in her own legs three years ago			1
she said : ‘ i had always struggled looking at them but it got one thousand times worse over night			0
my biggest fear had come true			0
‘ catching sight of them would trigger major anxiety and end up with a full - blown panic attack			0
' i was struggling to cope and got to the point where i thought life would be easier if i was n’t trying to avoid my legs all the time			2
’ she saw her gp who refused the amputation but instead agreed to refer her for surgery to remove the varicose veins			1
however , in the past two years she has had two more children and more varicose veins appeared			1
she added : ‘ had i known i was going to extend the family i would have waited to have the vein operation as unfortunately they have come back as happens with pregnancy			0
‘ i just hope this helps people understand because one of the hardest thing about living with a phobia can be being laughed at and judged			0
‘ women tell me they would love legs like mine but i just can not see them that way			2
to me they are just terrifying			0
