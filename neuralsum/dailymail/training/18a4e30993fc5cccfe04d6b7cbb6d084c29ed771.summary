a major security flaw has been found in @entity1 , @entity2 's phone software			1
the bug could allow hackers to gain control of a device if the user is running an old version of the software			0
however , the search giant has come under fire for saying it will not address the issue - which experts say could leave up almost a billion users vulnerable			2
@entity1 4.4 and 5.0 , are unaffected by the latest flaw			1
however , around 60 percent of @entity1 users are using 4.3 or below , and are at risk			1
users of the latest @entity1 handsets or those who have update to @entity1 4.4 and 5.0 , are unaffected			1
however , around 60 percent of @entity1 users are using 4.3 or below , and are at risk			1
these users are advised to update their software if they can			2
the flaw is in @entity25 , a component used to render web pages on an @entity1 device inside an app that 's not necessarily an internet browser , which affects all @entity1 versions before @entity1 4.4 @entity32			1
@entity1 4.4 and 5.0 , are unaffected			1
however , around 60 percent of @entity1 users are using 4.3 or below , and are at risk ' if the affected version [ of @entity36 ] is before 4.4 , we generally do not develop the patches ourselves , but welcome patches with the report for consideration , ' said @entity2			1
' other than notifying oems , we will not be able to take action on any report that is affecting versions before 4.4 that are not accompanied with a patch			0
' @entity48 's @entity47 discovered the security bug , and @entity2 's response , which he described as ' some eyebrow - raising news			2
' webview is used in about 930 million @entity1 devices , @entity47 said			0
' unfortunately , this is great news for criminals for the simple reason that , for real bad guys , pretty much everything is in scop , ' he said			0
he called for @entity2 to take action			0
' as a software developer , i know that supporting old versions of my software is a huge hassle			0
' i empathize with their decision to cut legacy software loose			0
' however , a billion people do n't rely on old versions of my software to manage and safeguard the most personal details of their lives			0
experts have called for @entity2 to take action and fix the issue , even though it only affects users of an old version of @entity1			1
' in that light , i 'm hoping @entity2 reconsiders if ( when ) the next privacy - busting vulnerability becomes public knowledge			2
' @entity47 told @entity81 that he learned of the policy change last october and suspects it coincided with the release of @entity85 , the klatest version of @entity2 's @entity1 software			1
. ' it 's important to consider that there is no published end - of - life or end - of - support policy from @entity2 with regard to any version of @entity1			1
the latest @entity1 distribution figures from @entity2 indicates that 46 per cent of @entity1 devices still run on @entity95 , another 39.1 per cent use @entity32			2
@entity95 runs on about 7.8 per cent of handsets , @entity97 , 6.7 per cent and @entity1 about 0.4 per cent			0
' @entity2 may decide to drop support for @entity32 tomorrow , though doing so would be suicidal			0
' of course , i would expect that dropping support for 60 % of your install base would also be suicidal , yet here we are , ' he said			0
