by @entity0 the @entity1 were christmas @entity2 and @entity3 had not even been born when midwife @entity4 started working for the @entity5			1
fifty years on , the 67 - year - old grandmother is about to retire from @entity7			1
mrs @entity4 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , said : ‘ it 's lovely bringing babies into the world , seeing new life and seeing new mums through difficult times , but i 've decided it 's time to retire			2
@entity4 , 67 , is retiring after 50 years in the @entity5 working as a nurse and then a midwife mrs @entity4 joined the @entity5 when she was just 17			1
she is pictured at @entity19 in the mid- 70s ‘ i 've seen so many changes			0
at one time we did n't have the dads at deliveries			0
i think things now are more informal - the uniforms certainly are ! ’ ms @entity4 , who has a four - year - old granddaughter , began her career with the @entity5 at 17 as a pre-nursing student at @entity29			1
she returned to her home patch in 1966 to spend two years at @entity31 before heading to @entity32 to train as a midwife			2
in her first few years on the job , ms @entity4 ’s patch included the city 's tough @entity37 area which was home to families whose fortunes depended on the nearby docks			1
she then spent the 1970s as a nurse and midwife in @entity45 and @entity46 before returning to @entity9 in 1981			1
mrs @entity4 ( pictured with her husband , @entity48 , and their children in 1987 ) says that when she first became a midwife men did not enter the delivery room ms @entity4 , who is now a midwifery sister in the maternity unit 's operating theatres , said : ‘ i could n't tell you how many babies i 've delivered , but it must be thousands			1
‘ my daughter is 29 , so i 'm now at the stage where i 'm delivering her friends ' babies and that 's really lovely			0
’ ms @entity4 says she had always wanted to be a nurse and after finishing school aged 15 she went to technical college to get the qualifications she 'd need to train as a nurse			1
she said : ‘ so many things have changed while i ’ve been working - most of them good			2
‘ people now are fitter than they were in the 1960s , and we have better diets			0
‘ now we get many older mums , women in their 40s just starting their families but many of them are fitter and healthier than women in their 20s were 40 years ago			2
‘ another thing is that years ago people used to die from things that now they do n't			0
mrs @entity4 ( left graduating in 1968 and , right , as a young nurse in 1971 ) says that the uniforms nurses and midwives wear have become much less formal during her long career in the @entity5 ‘ and our attitude to patients has changed too - when i first started nursing if someone had cancer they almost certainly would die , but we would n't tell them			1
‘ the attitude was that you could n't do a lot for a lot of people and you did n't tell them they were dying			0
‘ then , at some point along the line , it was decided that it really was n't our place to keep it from them			0
‘ i have n't watched @entity108 , but i think my time in @entity32 was a bit like that			0
‘ we would get lots of ladies who were n't very well nourished having lots of babies and that could lead to problems			0
‘ but even now at @entity118 there are ladies coming in having their eighth , ninth , even tenth baby			0
’ mrs @entity4 says that while she has been in the @entity5 people 's health and diets have improved			1
image shows her class graduating at @entity128 in 1968 mrs @entity4 ( pictured with her son in 1986 ) said : ' it is lovely bringing babies into the world ' she added : ‘ now , people want to go home sooner too			2
if there 's not been any complications the ladies go home the same day or the day after they 've given birth			0
‘ one time they were encouraged to be in bed for days - now that 's the last thing we want people to do			0
‘ i 've only been working two days a week for a bit and now i 've decided it 's time to go and i 've handed my notice in			0
’ mrs @entity4 says she hopes to spend her retirement enjoying time with her granddaughter and cycling in the countryside with her husband			2
@entity153 , @entity7 ’s interim chief executive , paid tribute to mrs @entity4 ’s service			1
she said : ‘ @entity4 ’s service to the @entity5 and @entity7 has been outstanding and is to be applauded			1
‘ her care , commitment and passion serve as a benchmark for all our staff and , while she will be sadly missed , we wish @entity4 the very best in retirement and thank her for her wonderful years of dedication			2
