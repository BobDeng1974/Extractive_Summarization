by @entity0 published : 08:41 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 06:25 est , 3 march 2014 @entity2 might not sound like an obvious choice of diet drink but it seems they could be the weight - loss answer we 've all been looking for			1
the @entity2 diet combines a menu of tropical fruit with healthy protein shakes , weight - loss supplements and regular workouts and claims to result in a new bikini body in just four weeks			1
sound too good to be true ? @entity15 put it to the test			0
@entity0 lost 10lbs and toned up through following the @entity2 diet plan and regular gym sessions @entity21 : ' i had piled on a few pounds over @entity23 and , at just 5ft 4in , it was noticeable , so i decided to see whether the @entity2 diet could make a difference			1
despite its name , the diet allows no alcohol			2
the @entity2 moniker comes from the cocktail flavoured protein shakes that i drank five times a week , and from all the mango , papaya and pineapple i ate			1
the concept behind the plan is to get in the holiday spirit by eating the same healthy things you might while sunning yourself abroad , thus inspiring you to get your bikini body back			0
you start each day with melt water - regular tap water which has been put in the freezer and then melted again			1
this , say the brains behind the diet , is crucial because the freezing and thawing process removes salts and other harmful material while retaining essential minerals such as calcium , magnesium and natrium			2
later , you get to tuck into a meal plan that focuses heavily on vitamin c and is complemented by @entity56 tablets , thought by some to help with weightloss , and meal replacement @entity58			0
she ate one pineapple a week , and despite the name , did n't indulge in calorific cocktails like @entity2 a typical breakfast would be poached or boiled eggs with steamed spinach and / or broccoli , or some fresh blueberries and @entity70 yoghurt and nuts			1
on a non-shake day , lunch would feature a stir fry or perhaps celery , beetroot and veggies with a turkey breast			0
i 'd end the day with butternut squash , courgette and lean fish for dinner			0
while trans fats were all but banned , healthy ones were allowed			0
i would cook with walnut oil and drizzle some extra virgin olive oil over salads			0
typical breakfast of poached eggs and steamed spinach typical non-shake day lunch with lean meat or fish and veg @entity94 , courgette and lean fish for dinner the secret ingredients in the diet are the re : active @entity2 flavour @entity100 and the re : active @entity56 pills			1
the pills contain extracts from the @entity107 garcinia gambogia fruit , which looks like a small pumpkin and is used in curries and chutneys			2
its ' magic ' component is hydroxycitric acid ( @entity114 )			0
@entity114 has been found to suppress the appetite , inhibit fat production and increase energy levels - without the negative side effects of caffeine			2
another key benefit is its capacity to boost levels of serotonin , relieving stress and low moods which often prompt us to binge eat			0
with the ' shake and take ' drinks , each bottle contains a small amount of powder , to which water is added to produce a reasonably tasty 234 - calorie shake			2
the re : active @entity100 in @entity2 flavour was her staple lunch or dinner for five out of seven days a week , and took @entity56 caffeine free fat burner pills before each meal to boost results a breakfast of blueberries and @entity70 yoghurt was common stir frys are satisfying and contain hardly any calories peas and lemon chicken was @entity0 's first dinner on the diet one - off dining out was n't a problem as @entity0 indulged in plain lobster and steak with lemon - dressed salad but shedding the pounds is n't just about eating well and so i met trainer @entity158 at @entity159 in @entity160 once a week for a 45 - minute workout and weigh - in to keep track of my progress - and to keep me on the straight and narrow ! we worked with weights , kettlebells , @entity168 and steps to build strength , tone up and burn fat			1
he took my measurements and kept an eye on my eating habits with @entity176			0
we built my strength up and i am now able to do 30 full press ups in a workout - before i could n't even manage one			2
personal trainer @entity181 talks @entity0 through lunges - with extra weight - at @entity159 in @entity160 push ups were a struggle but @entity0 was eventually able to do 30 in just one session @entity0 using the @entity168 at @entity159 in @entity160 during her weekly personal training session i 'm absolutely thrilled with losing 10lbs in just four weeks , taking me down from 10st 7bs to 9st 11lbs			1
i feel like some weight has come off evenly , all over , and i 'm so much more toned			0
my waistline slimmed from 29.5in to 27.5in , and my hips from 40in to 38in			0
i 'm even fitting into some size 8 clothes , which is nothing short of a miracle			0
despite the protein shakes and pills , it did n't feel like i was on a ' diet ' - it was n't torturous and i did n't feel deprived			1
a week after finishing the diet , i 'm still hitting the gym regularly and i 've learned to love healthy eating , although i 'm glad i 'm off the shakes and that no - one 's keeping an eye on my chocolate intake anymore ! the @entity207 costs just Â £ 39.99			1
this includes a four week diet and exercise plan , plus the re : active @entity213 and @entity56 supplements find out more and download a four - week meal plan from @entity207 @entity0 lost pockets of fat from her flanks , back and thighs , and her arms slimmed down through the diet she felt her stomach flattened yet she felt satisfied with plenty of fruit and @entity70 yoghurt in just four weeks our ft 4 " reporter lost 10lbs through a special diet and exercise plan			1
