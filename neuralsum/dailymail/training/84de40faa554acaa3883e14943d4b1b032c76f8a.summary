by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:58 est , 13 june 2012 updated : 04:09 est , 14 june 2012 if you sign up to be a postman in @entity4 , trudging through rain , sleet and whatever else the weather throws at you is pretty much the job description			2
unless , it seems , you work in @entity10 – where @entity11 is refusing to deliver letters to businesses in wet weather			1
two firms of accountants and a computer business in the town ’s @entity18 have been told to collect their post from the main sorting office when it rains , after a postman slipped on a wet mossy pavement and broke his shoulder			1
' bizarre ' : @entity26 , who runs an accountant 's business from an office in @entity18 is one of three businesses to appeal against the decision managers at @entity10 ’s main sorting office did manage to deliver a letter notifying the companies of their decision on monday - a dry day - saying the postman had slipped over last friday			1
yesterday customers described the move as ‘ completely laughable ’			1
@entity40 , who runs a business on the street , said : ‘ @entity18 is a main thoroughfare into the town and people are walking along here all the time … with the weather we have been having , we will never get any mail delivered			2
’ the letter , from delivery boss @entity50 , says : ' it has been brought to my attention that on june 8 , one of our postmen sustained injury whilst undertaking the delivery in your area			0
' the incident occurred as a result of our postman slipping over due to the footpath and steps being covered by moss and algae and a health and safety risk assessment has been undertaken			1
' this confirmed that the level of risk associated with this delivery is unacceptable due to the wet weather turning the footpath and steps into a dangerous surface to walk on			1
' under the circumstances , mail deliveries to your address will be suspended in wet weather conditions such as persistent rain , snow or ice , for health and safety reasons			2
' ' @entity84 belief ' : mrs @entity26 said the letter did not make sense , because there are no steps up to the offices and there is no sign of algae or moss on any of the pavements referred to in the letter @entity26 , who runs an accountant ’s business from an office in @entity18 is one of three businesses to appeal against the decision and yesterday described the move as ' bizarre '			1
mrs @entity26 said : ' the thing that really beggars belief is the apparent timetable of events			0
it took just 24 hours to do a risk assessment and decide we wo n’t get our post when it rains			0
' usually , it takes @entity11 a month to let us know they are holding an item of mail on which postage has been underpaid , usually by something like 9p			0
' when we pay this , plus the £ 1 surcharge , it takes at least a further week to send the item out , but when it comes to something like this it appears they know how to act fast			0
' laughable ' : managers at @entity10 's main sorting office did manage to deliver a letter notifying the companies of their decision on monday - a dry day - saying the postman had slipped over ' it just is n’t acceptable for them to tell us to collect our own post on days when the weather is wet			1
will they pay for the time or the expense we will incur going to the sorting office ? ' mrs @entity26 said the letter did not make sense , because there are no steps up to the offices and there is no sign of algae or moss on any of the pavements referred to in the letter			0
@entity149 from @entity150 , another accountancy firm with offices in @entity18 , has also lodged a formal letter of appeal			0
bossed by moss : the ban was brought in after a postman slipped on moss in rain while delivering letters ( stock picture ) ms @entity149 added : ' in our business we need to be able to rely on the post , and with the recent price rises , with a large letter now costing costing 90p , this just seems to be going too far			1
' we have no steps outside our premsises and if the pavement outside is slippery then surely that is something for them to take up with the council			0
' @entity11 spokeswoman , @entity175 said : ' last friday , a member of staff fell due to algae and moss on the pavement and steps at @entity18 and consequently broke his shoulder			1
' following a risk assessment of the area , we have notified @entity10 of the danger posed by the poor condition of the pavement and steps			2
' we have explained to customers in @entity18 that we must suspend deliveries to their address as a precautionary measure until the surfaces are improved by @entity10			2
' customers will be able to collect their mail from @entity194			0
' we know this is inconvenient and we apologise to customers , but the safety and welfare of our staff is paramount and we only suspend deliveries if the safety of our postmen and women is at risk			0
' @entity11 delivers to almost 29 million addresses across the @entity4 and our postmen and women go out in all weather conditions including wind , rain , snow and ice so it is always a last resort if we decide not to deliver to a specific address or addresses			0

@entity18 , in @entity10 , @entity215 , is a ‘ no go ’ area since a postman slipped on moss
businesses brand the decision ' completely laughable '
@entity11 say ' level of risk ' is ' unacceptable due to the wet weather turning the footpath and steps into a dangerous surface '
