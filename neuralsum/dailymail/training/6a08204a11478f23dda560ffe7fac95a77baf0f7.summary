' obviously the person who gave the award knows about peace - making and peace - keeping			0
' @entity6 's @entity18 chief executive is @entity80 , who worked as an adviser for mr @entity2 for three years and then for mr @entity28			1

' management staff in the region were not communicated with nor consulted about the award and were caught by surprise with this decision			0
' but in a statement , mr @entity2 's office claimed the article ' sought to traduce the reputation of @entity6 , and was neither balanced nor fair '			1

accepting the award , mr @entity2 said : ' from the beginning of humankind there has been brutality , conflict , intrigue , the destructive obsession with a narrow self - interest			2

to act not only in self - interest and sometimes to even to act in defiance of it			0
' mr @entity2 set @entity18 on course to meet its target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income on aid			2

much of the opposition to mr @entity2 centres on his decision to take @entity18 to war in @entity20			2
