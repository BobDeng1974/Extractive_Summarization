@entity0 tied the record for the best back - nine in @entity3 history as he catapulted himself into contention on day two of the @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7			1
the @entity8 was one over for the day and struggling to make the cut when he reached the turn but then fired six birdies and an eagle to come home in 27 and sit two shots behind @entity16 leader @entity15 on a congested leaderboard			1
@entity0 had fired a 71 on thursday and after three bogeys and an eagle on the front nine , he was two over for the tournament as he stood on the tee at the 435 - yard par - four 10th			2
back in it : @entity0 's astonishing back nine put him right back in contention in @entity7 in the lead : @entity15 made sure he was on top after two rounds by picking up two birdies late on but he birdied that and the 11th and picked up further shots on 13,14 and 15 before an eagle on 16 and a closing birdie			1
that made him just the eighth player in @entity3 history to shoot 27 over nine holes and his score was just one shot worse than @entity39 's front - nine record set at the @entity40 in 2006			1
' i had no concept of what i was doing , ' @entity0 told www.pgatour.com			0
' the seal was broken when i got to 10			0
it just spiraled from there			0
' i like to think i would be pretty good at shooting low rounds of golf through the past but certainly nothing like that			0
' @entity15 , meanwhile , followed up an opening 68 with an impressive 64 to take a two - shot lead over a large group on six under			1
eye on the ball : @entity57 continued his recent good form and shares second place with @entity0 the 28 - year - old birdied seven , eight , 10 , 11 and 13 before dropping his only shot of the day on the par - four 15th			1
at that point he was part of a large leading pack on six under but picked up shots on his final two holes to take a two - shot lead into the weekend			2
last week 's @entity68 winner @entity57 was amongst the chasing pack alongside @entity0 , @entity71 duo @entity70 and @entity72 , @entity74 @entity73 and @entity16 @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			2
bunkered : @entity79 's @entity78 plays a shot from the sand on the 12th hole during the second round two - time open champion @entity84 was two shots further back after a second consecutive 68 alongside @entity16 @entity87 and @entity89 's @entity88			1
in - form @entity90 was in the group at three under , one shot clear of overnight leader @entity78 who fired a disappointing 73			0
another former @entity96 champion , @entity95 , was just one shot off the lead after the first day but was suffering with an elbow problem and missed the cut by one shot after slipping to a 76 on friday			0
asked if the injury had impacted on his performance , @entity95 said : ' it did			0
to what degree , i do n't know			0

@entity0 shot a back nine of just 27 - one shot off the @entity3 record
@entity8 had been in *danger* of missing the cut at the turn
former world no 3 finally seems to be *recovering* his form
@entity16 @entity15 leads after two rounds
