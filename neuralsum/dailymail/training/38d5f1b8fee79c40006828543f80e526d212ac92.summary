@entity1 anchor @entity0 had a rocky experience trying to sign up for @entity3 as the insurance marketplaces opened up to a rocky start tuesday			1
the long anticipated rollout came despite the government shutdown and the snags are expected to contribute to a slow start to enrollment and give increased ammo to @entity14 's @entity13 foes			1
at least 25 of the 36 federally - run , state - specific marketplace sites posted error messages soon after open enrollment began at 8am , so @entity0 was far from alone			1
waiting : @entity0 ran into difficulties as she tried to sign up for the newly launched health - care exchanges			1
she gave up trying to sign up for a plan after 15 minutes online and about 20 minutes on the phone @entity0 described her experience in real time as she created an account at @entity25			1
she created a username and password and at first the process was typical			2
' pretty much like it would be for any other website , ' she said			2
after she created her account , @entity0 moved on to step two in the process , where she entered her and her family 's information			1
it was at step three , when the anchor would have chosen from among @entity3 plans , when she hit a snag			2
glitches : heavy @entity45 traffic and system problems plagued the launch of the new health insurance exchanges tuesday morning ' i keep getting this error page , ' she said , ' it wo n't let me progress			1
' after two phone calls and a combined 35 minutes trying to enroll in @entity3 , @entity0 gave up			1
' if i were signing up for myself , this is where my patience would be exhausted , ' she said			2
the website was showing signs of trouble handling the volume of consumers on october 1 , the first day of the six - month open enrollment period			1
federal officials are aware of the website problems and say they are working to address it as quickly as possible			1
@entity66 @entity65 spokeswoman @entity64 says officials " have built a dynamic system and are prepared to make adjustments as needed and improve the consumer experience			1
" the site for @entity72 , which is running its own exchange , displays a message saying ' we open at 12:00 noon on october 1st			1
' other callers to the federal call center where consumers can get help by telephone have reported long wait times			2
the federal government also announced delays for small business and @entity86 - language signups			1
system down : screenshot of the @entity65 website for the @entity3 exchanges the biggest expansion of society 's safety net since @entity94 is now in the hands of consumers , and most of their concerns do n't revolve around ideology and policy details			1
people want to know if they can afford the premiums , if the coverage will be solid , where the bureaucratic pitfalls are and if new federal and state websites will really demystify shopping for health insurance			2
full answers may take months			0
open for business : @entity3 's online insurance marketplace , pictured , went live at midnight			1
you can find it at www.healthcare.gov/marketplace people who do n't have access to job - based health insurance can start shopping right away for subsidized private policies			1
or they can wait to sign up as late as december 15 and still get coverage by january 1			0
consumers also could run into problems getting their right subsidy amounts			0
people with complicated tax returns and extended families living under the same roof could find they need personal assistance to work out the issues			0
referrals to state medicaid programs might go smoothly in some states , not so well in others			0
' as this unveils , it is going to be very clear that everything ca n't be done on a computer , ' @entity136 , director of @entity138 's marketplace , said in an interview prior to the launch			1
' but by day 60 to 120 , and the year after that , it 's going to get a lot more user - friendly and effective			1
' message : @entity14 recorded a video message for @entity66 military personnel in which he avoided blaming the @entity13 , saying only that ' @entity153 has not fulfilled its responsibility ' eventually , at least half the nation 's nearly 50 million uninsured people are expected to get coverage through the @entity3 , either through subsidized private plans sold in the new markets or an expanded version of @entity161 in states accepting it for low - income adults			1
immigrants in the country illegally will be the largest group remaining uninsured			0
people who do have access to employer - based plans will also see changes			2
starting january 1 , virtually all @entity66 will have a legal obligation to carry health insurance or face fines			0
passing up the company medical plan in exchange for a bigger paycheck may no longer be an option			2
but employees who lose their jobs , entrepreneurs starting their own businesses and people in between school and work could have an easier time getting coverage			0
also as of january 1 , a pre-existing medical condition will no longer be a barrier to getting health insurance			0
a partial government shutdown , driven by @entity13 opponents of increasing the federal role in health care , will not stop what they call ' @entity3			0
' core provisions and benefits are shielded from annual budget battles			0
if other government services are shut down , the health care overhaul can largely keep going - much like @entity203 and @entity94			2
' shutdown or no shutdown we 're ready to go , ' @entity65 secretary @entity204 said monday			0
@entity208 operated markets in 36 states open at 8 a.m. eastern time			1
the remaining states are running their own markets			0
shutdown : @entity213 , pictured , and president @entity14 squared off in a proverbial sparring match that ended up in a government shutdown on monday night polls show the country remains divided over the law , with opponents outnumbering supporters			0
nonetheless , a @entity222 survey released over the weekend found 56 percent of @entity66 disapproved cutting off funding to expand coverage for the uninsured , as congressional @entity13 have done			0
the poll also found people in a fog about what the law means for them			0
nearly three - fourths of the uninsured were unaware of the new insurance markets opening to serve them			1
in states not expanding @entity161 , millions of uninsured people below the federal poverty level will likely be shut out of coverage			0
that 's the case in @entity241 and @entity242 - both of which have large uninsured populations - and in many , but not all , @entity13 - led states			1
it 's because under the law , people below the poverty line - an individual making $ 11,490 , a family of four $ 23,550 - can only get the new coverage through expanded @entity161			1
and the @entity254 gave states the right to opt out			0
the other arm of ' @entity3 's ' coverage expansion - subsidized private insurance through the new markets - is mainly geared to uninsured people in the middle class			1
the administration is hoping to sign up 7 million the first year			2
young , healthy adults are prime customers , since they 'll help offset the cost of caring for sicker people sure to sign up once insurers can no longer reject them			0
@entity268 of @entity269 , @entity270 , has been uninsured for more than a year , since he turned 26 and could no longer stay on his parents ' insurance			0
he 's got a background in statistics that he hopes to apply to criminology , but he 's been working temporary jobs while looking for permanent employment in law enforcement			2
' not having health insurance has made me a little bit more cautious , ' said @entity268			0
' i like to snowboard , but it 's given me second thoughts			2
@entity285 forbid i should break my wrist or my arm			0
' @entity268 thinks he might be able to afford $ 100 to $ 200 a month for insurance			0
early indications are that he 'll find plenty of options			0
however , plans with the lowest premiums will have high deductibles and copayments , which means sizable out - of - pocket costs if he gets sick or has an accident			1
nonetheless , @entity268 says he 's definitely planning to check out the health insurance market			2
' my parents have been pushing for me to get health insurance , ' he said			0
' i might as well at least get something rather than pay ( a fine ) to not have anything			0

@entity0 called a *helpline* and was left on hold for 20 minutes before giving up
sites for at least 25 of the 36 exchanges open today posted errors as the marketplaces opened at 8am @entity313
officials blamed high traffic volume - @entity317 's exchange alone got two million visits just two hours after opening
