whiplash insurance claims linked to car crashes are rising again - adding £ 93 to the average premium , new figures show			1
the rise is being driven by lawyers trying to drum up business through cold calls and nuisance text messages			1
new figures from the insurance firm @entity10 suggest the number of personal injury claims linked to road accidents will have risen by nine per cent in the the year to april 2015			1
around 80 per cent of these will include a claim for whiplash , which is a far higher proportion than other comparable nations in @entity18			0
this will add up to 840,000 pay - outs worth £ 2.5billion			1
lawyers using nuisance text messages and cold calls are driving up claim numbers @entity10 says it is evidence of a damaging ‘ compensation culture ’			1
it believes a high proportion of the claims are bogus and blames ambulance chasing claims management companies and law firms			0
the insurance firm ’s data shows that 96 per cent of personal injury claims it received last year were brought by third parties			1
the government has put in place measures to try and tackle the menace , including introducing a cap on the legal fees surrounding claims as part of the @entity44			0
a new regime that vets and accredits medical experts who assess whiplash injury claims has also been set up by the government under an organisation called @entity51			0
however , @entity10 say these do not go far enough and it wants an end to cash windfall payments to people claiming a whiplash injury			2
instead , it says insurers should – in the first instance – be required to offer sufferers medical treatment			0
whiplash involves the sudden hyperextension ( right ) followed by immediate hyperflexion ( left ) of the neck , resulting in damage to the muscles , ligaments and tendons the firm ’s chief executive , @entity69 , said there has been a failure to address the excessive numbers of minor motor injury claims and the escalating costs surrounding them			2
‘ the @entity77 ’s compensation culture is at the root cause of the £ 93 cost of whiplash claims paid by motorists within their insurance premiums , ’ he said			1
‘ customers have told us they are fed up with compensation culture and all its trimmings : the nuisance texts and calls from claims management companies , excessive lawyers ’ fees and fraudsters abusing the system for their own financial gain			1
’ mr @entity69 said : ‘ we are here to help our customers when they need it , and pay genuine claims quickly			1
but we must address how to best treat the excessive number of fraudulent , exaggerated and minor whiplash claims which are driving up the cost of insurance			2
‘ sadly , we are now witnessing a resurgence in the number and cost of whiplash and soft - tissue injury claims despite some very positive developments , such as the @entity44 , which helped reduce customer premiums			2
@entity10 chief executive @entity69 : ‘ customers have told us they are fed up with compensation culture ' ' the introduction of a new system for sourcing medical reports in soft tissue injury claims is also a step forward			1
’ @entity10 says the length of time between an accident and a whiplash claim should be reduced from three years to one			2
and it argues that any claim should be backed up with medical evidence that the symptoms have lasted for more than three months			0
where someone can demonstrate real and lasting symptoms , they would be offered treatment rather than money			0
where problems persist , the insurer says cash payments would be offered against a set tariff			0
@entity10 claims its proposals could cut motor insurance tariffs by an average of £ 50 a year			1
mr @entity69 said : ‘ it is possible to cut the cost of motor insurance and ensure those who have suffered genuine injuries get the care or compensation they deserve			2
‘ we believe that everyone is entitled to fairly priced insurance to protect what is important to them			0
introducing these reforms is a challenge but we will not hide away from this - the @entity77 ’s motorists deserve even more affordable motor insurance			0
’ @entity10 says the large number of whiplash claims has driven up premiums here to an average of £ 372 a year			1
they are some 40per cent less in @entity158 and 50per cent cheaper in @entity159			0
at the same time , the proportion of insurance claims which include whiplash are much lower in these two other countries , where legal fees are also less .			0

rise driven by lawyers using nuisance text messages and cold calls
840,000 whiplash pay - outs worth £ 2.5billion made in last year , say @entity10
