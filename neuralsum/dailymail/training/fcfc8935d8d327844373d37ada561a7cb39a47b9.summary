as president @entity3 's signature health insurance overhaul effort began to enroll new participants on monday , some states running their own insurance exchanges saw huge levels of website traffic but paltry interest in signing up			1
@entity8 , the ultimate blue state whose federal lawmakers voted overwhelmingly in support of @entity12 , turned less than 1 per cent of its web visits into ' covered @entity8 ' participants on tuesday			1
' we had over 5.7 million hits to our website as of 3 p.m. yesterday , ' covered @entity8 spokeswoman @entity15 told @entity19			2
' 7,700 consumers began their application process yesterday			0
... 4,143 applications are pending , ' she added			0
' we received 23,269 calls yesterday to our service center			0
' @entity15 could n't say how many of the 5.7 million website hits were from unique @entity8			2
but assuming 712,500 online visitors saw eight different web pages each , the sign - up rate was 0.58 per cent			1
@entity3 - prayer ? the @entity30 is hoping millions of @entity31 will sign up for government - brokered health insurance , but so far there 's no indication that the throngs of website lookie - lous are applyling @entity38 saw a similarly low rate of interest			1
@entity42 congressman @entity41 tweeted after 8:30 p.m. monday that his state 's health exchange had ' received 28k visitors , and took 167 applications for health insurance			1
' that indicates just 0.59 per cent of @entity38 residents who sought information about their state 's @entity12 program on monday decided to become part of it , according to @entity56 spokeswoman @entity55			1
@entity57 @entity59 executive director @entity58 said in a statement that ' more than 12,000 business owners and individuals from across the state have shopped online for low - cost health insurance plans ... and the site has received nearly 30 million web visits			2
' @entity68 mayor @entity67 urged @entity8 to enroll in health care insurance through the covered @entity8 program , but his pleas may be falling on deaf ears a spokesman did n't respond to a request for clarification about whether those 12,000 people completed applications for health coverage			1
if they did , and if each ' web visit ' corresponded to a @entity57 who saw 8 pages , the state 's enrollment rate would be the lowest of all – 0.32 per cent			2
the low numbers of new enrollees stand in stark contrast to the robust website traffic statistics , suggesting that day - one anxieties about non-functioning online portals may have been overblown			1
only 14 states have opted to run their own health insurance exchanges			1
the @entity31 @entity94 is handling signup duties for the other 36 states and the @entity97			1
' starting today , ' president @entity3 said tuesday during a @entity103 event , ' you and your friends and your family and your coworkers can get covered , too			0
just visit healthcare.gov , and there you can compare insurance plans , side by side , the same way you ’d shop for a plane ticket on @entity110 or a tv on @entity112			0
' but his administration is n't saying how many @entity31 signed up online so far			1
@entity56 , the @entity38 state @entity12 insurance exchange , signed up just 167 members of the public on the first day of open enrollment , despite reports that the website was available and loading quickly on wednesday @entity94 spokeswoman @entity122 said the main @entity12 website had served 4.7 million unique visitors , adding to 190,000 phone calls and 104,000 online chats sessions that administrators had supervised			1
' millions want to get covered , ' according to the @entity12 system 's main @entity130 account on wednesday afternoon			2
' @entity31 across the country – millions of @entity31 – are taking advantage of the opportunity to shop for affordable health insurance that they could not attain before now , ' @entity30 press secretary @entity132 insisted on monday			0
but without enrollment figures , it 's impossible to know whether @entity12 is seeing a flood of new customers or just a trickle			0
the @entity30 did not respond to a request for those numbers			0
shutdown mashup : @entity30 press secretary @entity132 briefed reporters on wednesday , live - streamed on a website that the administration complained was partially inactive due to the government 's slimmed down operations some states are seeing greater interest , with signup rates in single - digit percentages			2
@entity154 reeived applications from 1.7 per cent of web visitors			0
@entity157 signed up 2.3 per cent			0
@entity158 reported receiving completed applications from 5.3 per cent			1
staff at the @entity161 in @entity162 , @entity38 wore ' get @entity12 ' buttons during a launch event on tuesday , but only 167 people statewide signed up that day @entity167 's participation rate is no more than 6 per cent , although that number may be @entity169 , a public information officer with @entity170 , told @entity19 that her state exchange 's website had served ' about 20,300 unique visit [ or ] s , ' resulting in ' just over 1,230 user accounts established			1
' but she could n't say how many people submitted completed applications			1
@entity97 government spokesperson @entity177 said wednesday that 15,452 unique visitors had seen his agency 's @entity180 website , and that new accounts were created for 4,171 individuals and families , and 136 small businesses – a rate of nearly 28 per cent			1
he , too , offered no numbers showing how many of those users applied for health insurance after they created accounts			0
but @entity177 did suggest that number was not as impressive			0
' we do n’t expect people to fully enroll this early , ' he said			0
glitch du jour : the @entity197 health care exchange , home of ' @entity199 , ' suffered from technical problems wednesday even though most state residents already have health insurance coverage @entity204 's health insurance administration , @entity205 , also said it had ' no enrollment numbers yet			1
' but spokeswoman @entity207 said the state 's insurance exchange website was seeing an average of 50,000 hits on its website every hour since it launched – a 24 - hour average of 1.2 million – from @entity213			2
just 2,500 new accounts resulted			0
at an estimated 8 pages per visitor , that 's an account - creation rate of less than 1.7 per cent			2
the number of actual applications would have been lower still			0
in a statement , the @entity220 reported that 292 businesses had enrolled in its coverage plans but would n't say how many individual taxpayers are taking part			0
' we do n't have any of those numbers yet , ' said spokeswoman @entity228			0
media representatives for health insurance exchanges in @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 did not respond to requests for enrollment statistics			2
@entity197 is running its own exchange but is expected to sign up few new enrollees since an existing program , created by former governor @entity241 , already covers most state residents .			0

@entity8 's program registered an estimated 0.58 per cent of website visitors in its first day
a @entity38 congressman boasted that his state took 167 applications for @entity12 services on day one , a rate of 0.59 per cent
@entity3 administration wo n't say how many @entity31 signed up on the central website that covered insurance exchanges for 36 states
@entity158 's 5.3 per cent application rate seems to be the nation 's *highest*
other states would n't provide statistics , or tracked only the creation of new online accounts , not numbers of completed applications
