by @entity1 reporter published : 10:50 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 10:52 est , 7 june 2013 a family has launched a campaign to make their health insurers cover the costs of a cochlear implant for their six - month - old son after the company said the life - changing procedure was ' elective '			1
@entity11 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , was born prematurely and has battled jaundice , gastric tube surgery and open heart surgery			0
he also suffers from profound hearing loss			1
after the family 's insurance company , @entity19 , covered procedures needed to overcome his other health issues , @entity11 's parents were stunned when they would not pay for the implant			1
' the fact that my son ca n't hear me - it breaks my heart , ' @entity35 told @entity29			2
' that i ca n't sing to him to soothe him - it breaks me up inside			2
' they have now launched a campaign on change.org to make insurance companies cover the procedure , which doctors say would help him to hear in his right ear			1
they note on the page that the procedure would cost around $ 125,000 for each ear - which is not something mr @entity11 , an @entity55 , can afford , he said			1
loved : he now needs a cochlear implant but insurance company wo n't cover it , his mother ( right ) said still smiling : @entity11 needed multiple surgeries after he was born - and the insurance company covered those a cochlear implant is a surgically implanted electronic device that gives a person who is profoundly deaf a sense of sound			1
it will not cure deafness , but is a prosthetic substitute for hearing			2
the sooner a child receives the implant , the less therapy will be needed to help him or her learn speech			2
the device is surgically implanted under a general anesthetic and the procedure takes up to five hours			2
it involves making an incision in the skin and attaching the device through the bone behind the ear and into the inner ear			0
the devices receives sound , processes it , and sends small electric currents near the auditory nerve			0
the currents activate the nerve , which sends a signal to the brain , which the person comes to learn as hearing			2
in the @entity97 , around 42,600 adults and 28,400 children have received them			0
' the fact that @entity19 is calling the ability to hear an elective surgery is just unbelievable to us , ' @entity99 said			0
' when you go with a particular healthcare plan through your company and pay for it , the expectation is that the procedures your family needs the most are going to be covered , ' mrs @entity35 added			0
but the insurance company said the family are best to take up the issue with their hr department			0
the insurance is provided through @entity30 's employer and @entity19 said the procedure is covered only for its fully insured members			1
but the representative said he was looking into the case and hoped to be able to help the family			0
for the @entity122 , it 's about a wider issue - and their desire to help other people across the country in need of the procedure			1
' when we found out that more than 90 per cent of commercial health plans in the country do cover cochlear implant surgery , we decided to start this petition to fight for @entity11 and other families like ours who are n't being treated fairly by insurance companies when it comes to hearing needs and services , ' they write on the petition			1
' this is a decision we think is best for our son and we should have the option to choose it for him			0
heartbreak : @entity35 became emotional as she said she hates how her son ca n't hear her voice hopeful : his parents have now started an online petition in the hopes the company will cover the costs ' @entity19 should change their policy and allow @entity11 , and other children like him , to have the gift of hearing			1
no one should have to go through what we have , especially when learning is so huge at @entity11 's age			0
' more than 37,000 people have signed the petition so far			0

@entity26 was premature and has undergone multiple operations
he now needs a hearing implant - but the insurers will not pay for it
they said his parents ' employers simply do not **include** it in their plans
parents have now started an online petition to **include** the life - changing procedure on insurance plans
