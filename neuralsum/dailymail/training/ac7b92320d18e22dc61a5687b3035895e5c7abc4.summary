by @entity0 published : 06:48 est , 4 july 2013 updated : 06:48 est , 4 july 2013 the process of labour and delivery usually looms large in a pregnant woman 's thoughts , with extensive birthing plans and preparation very much the norm			2
but in a story sure to terrify expectant mothers everywhere , a mother - of - two delivered her own baby in breakneck speed - whilst she was sitting on her toilet			1
in just thirty minutes , @entity15 , 27 , from @entity16 , @entity17 , delivered her baby girl after rushing to the bathroom thinking she needed the loo			1
@entity15 with her husband @entity21 and their new daughter winter at home write caption here although she had been in some discomfort for about 20 minutes , but she assumed she would have hours of labour and so did not rush to action			1
once on the toilet the @entity32 teacher felt a sudden need to push , and her baby fell into her arms just seconds later			1
@entity15 said : ' i 'd been in pain for about twenty minutes			2
' but all of a sudden i felt like i needed the toilet			0
i staggered to the loo , sat down , and before i knew it i could see the baby 's head			1
whilst baby @entity43 survived her dramatic delivery unscathed , mum @entity15 had to be rushed to hospital after haemorrhaging ' i lifted myself off the seat and just caught her as she came out			1
it all happened so quickly , i do n't think i even realised what had happened until afterwards			0
' i suppose it 's quite funny that i gave birth on the loo - but at the time it was the best place for it			2
' whilst baby @entity43 survived her dramatic delivery unscathed , mother @entity15 had to be rushed to hospital after haemorrhaging			1
the couple had carefully planned a hypno birth for @entity0 ( right ) after @entity15 had a bad birthing experience with her first daughter ( pictured left with the family ) luckily , both mum and baby have now recovered from @entity0 's exciting start to life			1
@entity15 said : ' it 's only now that i look back on it all and realise that it was quite exciting			1
' at the time i was just following my instincts			0
' the funny thing is my eldest daughter @entity74 , whose bedroom is next to the toilet , slept through the whole thing			0
' the mum of two had planned on having a relaxing hypnobirth , after suffering a painful 21 hour labour with her eldest daughter			0
@entity82 who was born in a incredibly fast thirty minutes , seemed undisturbed by her rather dramatic arrival @entity15 said : ' my husband and i spent a lot of time and money on hypnobirthing			1
you use lots of relaxation techniques and massage , and the idea is that you associate labour with something positive			0
' we wanted to have the baby at home , so had a birthing pool set up in the living room			0
' we just expected it to go very smoothly			0
' however , @entity15 's plans were scuppered when she woke up during the night in pain			1
' we just expected it to go very smoothly ' @entity15 admits @entity15 said : ' @entity74 had woken me up in the night			2
i went to comfort her and was just settling myself back into bed when my waters broke			0
' i was astonished because the baby was one week overdue and i just never thought it would happen			2
' in the time it took for me to walk downstairs to call my husband - who was at work - the pain had really started			0
' but i just lit some candles and put on some relaxing music - i was n't expecting to meet my daughter for a long time yet			0
' but whilst @entity15 was expecting a slow birth , her baby had other plans			1
@entity15 said : ' ten minutes later my husband came home and by this point i was getting quite concerned so i asked him to call the midwife			2
' but just five minutes later i felt the urge to go to the toilet			0
' i staggered across to the landing , sat on the toilet , and before i knew it i 'd delivered my baby			2
' when she was born i just followed my instincts			0
i pulled her onto my chest and gave her a rub to get her breathing			0
' my husband was still on the phone to the midwife , when the baby came out all pink and wriggling around , so i knew she was ok			0
' in fact , it was mum @entity15 that took a turn for the worse , and was rushed to @entity146 after haemorrhaging from her womb			1
luckily , doctors were able to give the new mum blood transfusions and she is now fully recovered .			1

@entity15 , 27 , thought she had hours until the birth
was *shocked* to see the baby 's head *crowning* as she went to the toilet
@entity15 was rushed to hospital suffering *hemorrhaging* , but fully recovered
@entity163 was born *healthy* and was unscathed from her birth
