a lawyer for phone - hacking victims in the @entity3 will meet the @entity5 attorney representing 9/11 families who fear their phones were also illegally hacked			1
@entity8 , the solicitor representing many celebrities who have won damages against the @entity11 in @entity12 , is crossing the @entity13 to take the battle to the doorstep of @entity17 ’s media empire			1
he is planning to launch three civil lawsuits over alleged phone - hacking against @entity20 victim by association : while princess @entity23 ( left ) may not have had her phone hacked , it is thought that her butler @entity25 ( right ) did but while in @entity26 mr @entity8 will also work with @entity27 , a lawyer who represents 20 families of victims of the 2001 outrage			1
@entity5 attorney general @entity31 launched an investigation last year after reports that @entity11 journalists had asked a @entity26 private detective to hack their phones , which he declined to do			2
mr @entity27 said : ‘ at the time we could not find any evidence anyone i represent was hacked			2
at this stage i ca n’t comment further because i do n’t know what will come out of the meeting			2
’ princess @entity23 ’s former butler @entity25 is expected to be one of the trio of individuals due to launch lawsuits claiming that their phones were hacked while they were on @entity5 soil			1
mr @entity8 said that one of the alleged victims was connected to princess @entity23 and the royal household whilst a second is linked to the @entity54 football team			1
the third is described as a ‘ @entity57 case ’ as the person was in touch with a well - known celebrity which made him a target			2
in another first , at least once of the cases allegedly involves a phone belonging to a @entity5 citizen			2
mr @entity8 will file civil lawsuits in @entity5 on their behalf ‘ imminently ’ as all three are claiming that the criminality took place whilst they were on @entity5 soil			1
possible victims : an acquaintance of @entity74 's ( left ) is thought to be one of the people whose phone was hacked at @entity78 , and @entity79 ( right ) is also allegedly a victim as well the legal action could open up @entity20 to further embarrassing revelations and bring the scandal to its headquarters in @entity26			1
so far it has been largely confined to the @entity3			0
in an interview with @entity87 , @entity8 says that all of the numbers which were allegedly hacked were found in the notebooks of @entity91			0
he was the private detective formerly employed by the @entity11 , which was owned by @entity20 subsidiary @entity92 before the newspaper was closed down in july last year			0
@entity8 claims that the individuals themselves may not have been the only people who were targeted but those close to them too may have come under scrutiny			0
lawsuits : lawyer @entity8 ( left ) said he will file civil lawsuits against @entity17 's ( right ) @entity5 branch of @entity20 on behalf of his clients as all three claim the hacking took place on @entity5 soil he told the @entity87 : ‘ this is getting wider			1
‘ it ’s not just the people who were a-list or celebrities , but people who were in their circles - people who might call them or work with them , what i would call the ordinary people who just got caught in the crossfire ’			0
@entity8 declined to say which newspaper carried out the alleged hacking but said he is keen to start requesting documents through the @entity5 courts as soon as possible			0
he said : ‘ we ’ve only seen the documents that exist in respect to @entity92 in @entity54 , and there ’s been no process of discovery in respect of @entity20 ‘ that could be the next thing that we have to find out			0
’ another arm of his legal action could be a separate lawsuit that examines ‘ the dirty tricks that might have been used in order to further the commercial aims for @entity20 , ’ he added			0
earlier this month @entity132 was forced to step down as chairman of @entity134 amid questions over his role in the scandal			0
the @entity138 has already reportedly begun examining claims by the actor @entity74 that his phone was hacked by the @entity11 whilst he was at @entity78 in @entity26			1
@entity20 declined to comment .			0

three lawsuits set to be filed on behalf of *unidentified* clients , but they are *suspected* to be @entity79 , a friend of @entity74 's , and princess @entity23 's butler @entity25
