lawyers for a transgender inmate convicted of murder asked the @entity4 @entity3 monday to overturn a ruling denying her request for sex - reassignment surgery			1
a federal judge ordered the @entity10 to grant the surgery to @entity12 in 2012 , finding that it was the ' only adequate treatment ' for @entity12 's severe gender dysphoria , also known as gender - identity disorder			1
that ruling was overturned in december by the 1st @entity4 @entity17			0
@entity3 appeal ? convicted murderer @entity12 , born @entity12 , is fighting to overturn a ruling that denied her request for a sex - change surgery			1
before and after pictures of @entity12 as a man on the left in 1990 , and living as a woman on the right in 1993 lawyers with @entity27 told @entity28 they asked the @entity3 to grant a hearing or to reverse the ruling by the appeals court			1
they argue that the appeals court did not find ' clear error ' in the judge 's ruling granting the surgery and therefore had no legal basis to overturn it			2
@entity12 , born @entity12 , is serving a life sentence for killing spouse @entity38 in 1990			1
now 65 , @entity12 has fought to get the surgery for two decades			2
in 2002 , judge @entity40 found that the treatment @entity12 was receiving in prison was inadequate , but stopped short of ordering the surgery , finding that the @entity10 had not violated her @entity44 right against cruel and unusual punishment			1
victim : @entity12 was convicted in 1990 of murdering her wife @entity38 ( pictured ) after that , prison officials began to provide hormone treatments , electrolysis to remove facial hair , female clothing and personal items			1
in 2005 , @entity12 sued the @entity10 again , arguing that the surgery was a medical necessity			2
in 2012 , @entity40 became the first judge in the country to order sex - reassignment surgery as a remedy for an inmate 's gender - identity disorder			1
courts in other states have ordered hormone treatments , psychotherapy and other treatments , but not surgery			0
@entity40 found that the @entity10 had violated the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the @entity44 by providing inadequate medical care to @entity12			0
a three - judge panel of the 1st @entity4 @entity17 upheld @entity40 's ruling , but the state appealed , citing security concerns about protecting @entity12 from sexual assaults if she completes her gender transition			1
she is currently housed in an all - male prison , but hopes to be transferred to the state 's women 's prison after the surgery			0
in december , a divided appeals court overturned the ruling by a 3 - 2 vote			2
@entity12 's lawyers argue that the appeals court overstepped its bounds and essentially re-tried the case			2
' their role is to defer to the trial judge on issues of fact , ' said @entity91 , director of the @entity92 , the @entity93 - based legal group that brought the lawsuit that led to @entity95 becoming the first state in the country to legalize gay marriage			0
' the meaning of the @entity44 is only as rich as its application , so those words that require prisons to provide adequate medical care are hollow if you have a district judge that makes the kind of careful fact findings that judge @entity40 did who is then reversed on appeal without a demonstration of the error in his facts , ' @entity99 said			0
@entity12 's lawyers also argue that the @entity44 prohibits prison officials from denying necessary medical treatment to an inmate for non-medical reasons , including security concerns			0
a message seeking comment was left monday for the @entity10			0
it is unclear when the @entity3 will decide whether to hear the case			0
the court receives between 7,500 and 8,000 new cases in a term and agrees to review roughly 1 percent of those appeals .			0
