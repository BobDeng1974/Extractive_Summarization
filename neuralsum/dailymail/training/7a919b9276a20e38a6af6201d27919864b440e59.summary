by @entity0 and @entity1 homeowners should brace themselves for sharp increases in the cost of their mortgages , the @entity2 warned yesterday			1
it is a bitter blow for @entity9 ’s 11.2million mortgage holders and comes as a direct result of the chaos in the eurozone			1
the crisis is driving up the cost of borrowing for high street lenders in this country – and they aim to ‘ restore ’ their profit margins by passing on that cost			1
homeowners should brace themselves for sharp increases in the cost of their mortgages , the @entity2 warned yesterday experts fear higher rates will mean many homeowners will have to find thousands of pounds extra a year , and some will be pushed ‘ over the edge ’			1
the warning comes on a bleak day for the economy , which is stuck in a double - dip recession as policymakers and politicians try to insulate it from @entity32 ’s chaos			0
the @entity2 said the eurozone crisis is beginning to hit homeowners , many of whom are already struggling to find the money to make their monthly repayments			1
since the start of the year , the funding costs for the high street banks have soared – and they are passing on the pain to their customers , including homeowners and savers			0
the @entity2 ’s report warned : ‘ in the absence of falls in funding costs , it suggests that some further increase in mortgage rates is likely as banks seek to restore their margins			1
’ some of the biggest mortgage lenders , such as @entity55 , the co-op and @entity57 , have already hit their customers with an increase in their ‘ standard variable rate ’ loans			1
this is the type of loan which homeowners are automatically moved on to when their current deal , such as a two - year fixed loan or a three - year tracker , comes to an end			1
experts have for weeks been advising @entity70 mortgage holders with equity in their property to scramble to get back onto a fixed rate while deals are still available			1
@entity75 , 23 , a personal assistant , and her boyfriend , electrician @entity77 , 24 , are preparing to remortgage their property after their fixed rate deal ended last month			1
uneasy : @entity77 and @entity75 do n't like the uncertainty of being on @entity55 's @entity70 and are looking to fix again the couple , from @entity81 , @entity82 , are now paying @entity55 ’s 3.99 per cent @entity70 after their two - year 4.2 per cent fixed - rate deal ended on april 9			1
but although the @entity70 is lower than the fixed rate , the couple are uncomfortable with a floating rate that they fear could rise further			2
miss @entity75 said : ‘ i have already spoken to an independent broker about remortgaging			0
we definitely want another fixed rate			2
‘ we have equity in the property so we should be able to fix for two years at an even lower rate than 3.99 per cent			2
this is our preferred option because we do n’t want sleepless nights about rates going up			0
’ up to eight million homeowners are thought to be on a variable rate , according to the @entity97			1
this includes those on tracker deals as well as those on the @entity70			0
however , many of those on fixed rates will have to remortgage in the coming months as their deal expires			2
experts said cheap deals are being replaced every day by more expensive options			0
last friday , @entity108 raised its two - year fixed rate loan from 3.24 per cent to 3.54 per cent			1
tomorrow @entity110 will raise its two - year fixed from 3.29 per cent to 3.49 per cent			2
any hike of interest rates risks sparking a fresh rise in the number of home reposessions , which had stabilised only this month			0
the 9,600 repossessions between january and the beginning of april was the same number as a year ago , according to data from the @entity97 , breaking the recent trend of year - on - year increases			0
record - low interest rates have helped mortgage borrowers in the past two years , despite the banks lending at much higher rates than the @entity2 0.5 per cent base rate , and 2011 saw the lowest annual number of repossessions in four years - at 36,200 homes			1
the @entity97 had said it could this summer revise the expected number of homes reposessed in 2012 down from 45,000 , but the fresh warning over interest rates has now put that at risk			0
presciently , the @entity97 said in a statement last week : ' continuing pressures on household finances , changes to welfare benefits and an upward drift in mortgage rates all have the potential to disrupt the current stable picture			0
' the @entity2 said the eurozone crisis is beginning to hit homeowners , many of whom are already struggling to to make their monthly repayments @entity148 , of debt advisers the @entity150 , warned : ‘ the margin between being able to pay your mortgage and falling into arrears is paper - thin for many			1
‘ even a small increase in their mortgage costs will push many over the edge			2
’ around one in ten homeowners with a loan are in ‘ some form of distress ’ , which typically means they have fallen behind with their repayments , according to the @entity150			0
one of the charges levelled against the banks is that they are raising rates even though the @entity2 base rate has been frozen at 0.5 per cent since march 2009			1
@entity170 of the @entity171 , said : ‘ the taxpayer imagines that part of the deal is that , having rescued the banks , they will help homeowners and businesses			2
but people are thinking to themselves “ this is not happening ”			0
’ a @entity97 spokesman said it was wrong to assume that banks could borrow money at 0.5 per cent base rate			1
she said : ‘ effectively , the cost to the lender of borrowing money from savers has risen			2
‘ also , problems in the eurozone have been causing significant difficulties in recent months , and funding costs are higher than they were a year ago			2
’ @entity193 the financial regulator has warned that homeowners in their 50s are sitting on ‘ a ticking timebomb ’ of mortgages handed out during the boom years			0
during a grilling by @entity203 last month , @entity200 , a director of the @entity201 , raised his fears about interest - only mortgages which are coming to the end of their life – but the homeowners have no money to pay off the loan			0
of the 11.2million mortgages in @entity9 , about four in ten are interest - only , meaning the homeowners pay only the interest but not a penny of the actual loan			1
between 2011 and 2020 , the @entity201 expects about 1.5million such mortgages – worth a staggering £ 120billion – ‘ will be due for repayment ’			0
mr @entity200 told the treasury select committee : ‘ there is a ticking timebomb that has been created over the last 20 years			0
’ the @entity201 said its figures mean 150,000 interest - only mortgages will come to the end of their life every year for the next decade			0
the vast majority of people with these types of loans – 80 per cent – have ‘ no repayment strategy ’ , the @entity201 said .			0

experts fear some of @entity9 's 11.2million mortgage holders may be ' pushed over the edge ' by hikes
banks blame eurozone crisis for driving up cost of borrowing - then pass cost on to *consumers*
but the @entity2 's base rate of interest is still at record low of just 0.5 per cent after *38* months
experts urge any mortgage holder on a variable rate to secure a fixed - rate deal as soon as possible
