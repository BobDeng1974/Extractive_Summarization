twisted @entity1 supporters are distributing a sickening video game that allows users to play the role of @entity6 extremists on a mission to murder @entity8			1
supporters of the terror group , which has brought rape and massacre to vast swathes of @entity14 and @entity15 , have modified the popular video game @entity16 to create characters based on @entity1 militants			1
the user - generated modification , or ' mod ' in video game parlance , is understood to reward users for killing @entity8 and characters based on @entity14 regime soldiers and the brave @entity26 peshmerga fighters who have formed the most effective resistance against the terrorists in real life			1
although the mod is not part of an official release by @entity34 developers @entity35 , @entity1 supporters are said to be using it to recruit children and radicalise the vulnerable , distributing it free on gaming forums to those declaring their support for the terror group 's self - styled caliphate			1
however @entity1 supporters quickly ' hijacked ' the mod and enabled users to play as the jihadis themselves , encouraging them to murder characters based on @entity8 and @entity59 troops			1
according to the website , one @entity1 supporter took to a well known pro-terror web forum to promote the mod , posting : ' in the latest version of the game @entity16 there are mods in which a user can play as an @entity1 militant , especially against the @entity81 and @entity14 army			2
' a second anonymous supporter replied : ' i will , with the help of @entity86 , make dozens of copies for this game and distribute it for free to all the brothers that use the name of the @entity93			0
' it is not the first time @entity1 has hijacked @entity96 video games to spread propaganda , having previously used @entity98 to recruit children and radicalise the vulnerable			1
modified : although the mod is not part of an official release by @entity34 developers @entity35 , @entity1 supporters are said to be using it to recruit children and radicalise the vulnerable chilling : @entity1 ' black flag of jihad is seen painted on cars and flying on flag poles in the video game mod hijacking the @entity16 modification is just the latest attempt by @entity1 supporters to use the growing influence of video games to recruit children to their twisted cause and radicalise the vulnerable			1
last september @entity1 uploaded a video to @entity117 that carried the group 's chilling black jihadi flag and showed violent scenes from the game - including police officers being gunned down and lorries being blown up by suicide bombers			2
at the start of the video a message appears that reads : ' your games which are producing from you , we do the same actions in the battelfields ( sic ) ! ! '			0
as the video continues , the players can be heard chanting @entity65 slogans whenever a bomb explodes or another character is killed			0
pro-jihadi music is also heard playing throughout the video , which is designed to look and sound like the terror group 's real - life footage of brutal slaughter that it has filmed in @entity14 and @entity15			2
the modification actually started as an @entity59 update , with video game players creating characters to fight against who were based on the @entity65 militants			2
users initially played the game as the @entity15 army ( pictured ) sick : @entity1 supporters are now distributing the @entity16 modification on gaming forums to those declaring their support for the terror group 's self - styled caliphate @entity161 media said that the video is meant to ' raise the morale of the @entity164 , and the training of children and young teenagers to fight the @entity168 , and throw terror into the hearts of opponents of the state ' , according to @entity173			1
@entity1 has also made continual references to the hugely popular @entity175 , producing slick posters that adopt the video games title to refer to jihad			1
they have even produced slick propaganda films that ape @entity175 's gameplay , using hd helmet cameras , freeze frame footage and heavily edited audio to make the terrorists ' real - life murder and massacre in the @entity14 city of @entity189 look like little more than a video game			1
a man has been blindfolded and thrown off a tower block in @entity14 for ' being gay ' before being stoned to death after surviving the fall			0
new images emerged appearing to show @entity1 militants hurling the man off the seven - storey building in the town of @entity201			2
the man , who was supposedly being punished for having a ' homosexual affair ' , apparently survived the fall , but was stoned to death by a waiting crowd at the foot of the tower block			0
footage shows the man sat on a plastic chair , while blindfolded , before being thrown off the tower block the @entity214 - based @entity213 , which relies on a network of activists on the ground , claims the man was thrown from the building before being beaten to death			0
photographs of the incident appear to show the man - who is thought to be in his 50s - sat on a white , plastic chair while blindfolded			0
he is surrounded by at least two masked militants , who are dressed in black clothing and army fatigues			0
the man is then thrown from the top of the tower block and one photograph shows him falling towards the ground , head first			0
the man was hurled from the building , at least seven storeys high , as punishment for ' being gay ' the crowd appeared to surround the man before beating him with stones until he fell unconscious			0

@entity1 supporters have modified @entity16 so users can play as the militants
jihadi characters are able to kill @entity8 and @entity14 regime soldiers
also carry out attacks on characters based on @entity26 *pershmerga* forces
@entity255 is not an official release by @entity34 developers @entity35
but jihadis are using it to recruit children and radicalise vulnerable , giving it out for free on gaming forums to those declaring support for @entity1
@entity1 supporters have previously used popular video games @entity267 and @entity175 in their sickening propaganda films
