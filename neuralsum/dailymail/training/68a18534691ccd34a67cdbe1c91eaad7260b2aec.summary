@entity2 , who is around four and a half months pregnant , will return to work properly for the first time since before @entity4 with a visit to an addiction centre in @entity12 tomorrow , followed by a ‘ royal away day ’ to @entity14 , @entity15 , on march 5			1
in a far cry from her recent @entity18 holiday on the island of @entity20 , tomorrow sees the 31 - year - old royal visit @entity22 , a 23 - bed residential treatment centre in @entity24 , south - west @entity12 , run by @entity25 , a charity of which she is patron			1
the centre treats women recovering from substance abuse and other compulsive disorders , many of whom have a history of difficult relationships and find an all - female environment a more supportive place to tackle their issues			0
@entity2 will meet staff and patients , all of whom are expected to have undergone initial detoxification , as well as learn more about the help they are given which includes daily workshops and one to one counselling sessions			1
she is not expected to undertake any more public engagements , however , until march 5 when she will travel to @entity14			0
the town has been in decline since the 1950s , when it was the busiest fishing port in the world , but is still one of the largest centres for fish processing in this country			1
unsurprisingly , she will first visit the @entity57 , where she will be given a personal guided tour of the museum by a local trawlerman			2
she will learn more about @entity14 ’s maritime and fishing heritage and have the opportunity to discuss issues around the environmental sustainability of fishing in the @entity67 – one of her father - in - law ’s pet projects			1
she will then go on to @entity71 where , as well as meeting the on - duty firemen and women , she will talk to young people taking part in personal development courses run by prince @entity78 ’s charity , @entity79			0
@entity14 has one of the highest levels of youth unemployment in the country , with around one in three struggling to find a job			0
downfall : @entity14 has been in decline since the 1950s , when it was the busiest fishing port in the world , but is still one of the largest centres for fish processing in this country the @entity79 is now offering 12 - week schemes for teenagers to help develop their team - building and @entity96 writing skills			2
as a result , three in four of those who complete the course move into work , education or training			2
it is the first time that the @entity5 has visited one of the charity ’s programmes but it is understood that she has discussed its work with her father - in - law at length			1
her final engagement of the day will be to officially open @entity111 , established in 2007 by the @entity112 , which serves more than 1,000 pupils aged between 11 and 18 in one of the most deprived areas in the country			0
she will also receive a tour of the school , meet an a-level photography group – something the @entity5 takes a keen personal interest in , having studied the subject herself – as well as view the sports facilities and an expressive arts display			1
@entity2 will carry out all her newly - announced engagements without her husband , prince @entity127 , who is putting off royal duties for the time being in order to concentrate on his ‘ day job ’ as an @entity133 pilot at @entity134 , @entity135			1
her decision to return to work suggests that she has recovered well from the severe pregnancy - related sickness , hyperemesis gravidarum , that blighted the early days of her pregnancy			2
tour : tomorrow sees the 31 - year - old royal visit @entity22 , a 23 - bed residential treatment centre in @entity24 , south - west @entity12 , run by @entity25 , a charity of which she is patron after being admitted to hospital in early december she cancelled all her forthcoming public engagements , save for a fleeting appearance at the @entity150 award shortly before @entity4			1
since then she has only been seen officially in public once , when she viewed her first official portrait at the @entity153 in @entity12 in early january , leading to questions being asked about her commitment to public duties			2
last week she and her husband issued a statement expressing their ‘ disappointment ’ that she had been photographed by paparazzi wearing a bikini while on holiday with her family in the @entity18			0
although @entity166 media were effectively barred from publishing the pictures as they were taken on one of @entity20 ’s private beaches , the shots were run by magazines and other media around the world			0
the couple were staying with their bodyguards in a luxurious £ 5million villa which boasts its own 64ft swimming pool			0
the villa , which cost a staggering £ 19,000 - a - week to rent , had a six - strong team of staff – including a chef – to tend to their every whim			0
@entity182 declined to comment on the holiday , saying it was ‘ private ’ .			0
