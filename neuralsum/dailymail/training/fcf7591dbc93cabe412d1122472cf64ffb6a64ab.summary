by @entity0 published : 09:18 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 10:59 est , 16 august 2013 from @entity3 's flip flop fetish to @entity6 's @entity5 sandals , there 's no getting away from the mandal ' - or men 's sandal - which is one of this season 's biggest trends			1
the summery shoes were spotted at @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 - among many others - and have since been seen adorning the extremities of most of the a-list			2
even @entity20 is partial to exposing his toes in public			0
clearly , sandals - be they flipflops , @entity26 , or more delicate , leather - strapped affairs - are a fashion force to be reckoned with			2
but they are also a sartorial minefield			0
what about socks ? are hairy toes allowed ? can real men have pedicures ? @entity37 teams his mandals with patterned pajamas , while @entity40 keeps it simple @entity41 accessorises with black nail polish but @entity43 goes au naturel mr @entity46 editor - in - chief , @entity47 , cleared up a few issues in an article for the @entity50			1
he advises that you ' handle your mandal with care			0
' rule number one is no socks , despite attempts by @entity16 - among others - to convince the world that the style beloved by grandads on the beach looks acceptable			2
' black socks , shorts and sandals will make you look like an @entity67 teacher , ' revealed @entity68 of @entity69 in the @entity50			0
as @entity72 discovered when he was ridiculed for sporting chunky sandals while on holiday earlier this summer , velcro straps and big buckles do n't cut it either			0
instead , says @entity47 , keep them plain and stick to dark colours such as black or brown leather			1
' team with looser rather than tighter trousers , ' he adds , ' and avoid any that look orthopaedic			0
' @entity3 styles his suit with flip flops @entity6 opts for an orthopaedic style @entity85 kicks back in @entity86 uh oh ! @entity87 mixes socks and sandals while singer seal opts for classic black leather mandals finally , while your mandals might be slick , if your feet are less than lovely , it 's time to put those toes away			1
as @entity47 puts it : ' there are two fictional characters it 's vital you do n't emulate : @entity103 ( ' filthy little hobbitses ' ) or hippy @entity104 from @entity107 's 1976 classic nuts in may			1
' in short : ' make sure your feet are in good shape : toenails need to be clean and short , calluses erased , dry skin buffed and excessive hair removed			1
' so do your man 's match up ? if not , it might be best to plump for a nice pair of loafers instead .			0
