by @entity0 speaking out : @entity1 threw down the gauntlet to @entity3 last night by publicly challenging him to impose a new wave of union reforms to combat the threat of a general strike @entity1 threw down the gauntlet to @entity3 last night by publicly challenging him to impose a new wave of union reforms to combat the threat of a general strike			1
the @entity12 mayor called on @entity3 to pull @entity13 out of the slump by clamping down on strikes , saying it was time to stop the ‘ endless buggeration ’ that disrupts public services			1
in his first major interview since this newspaper last week revealed his secret talks about making a quick commons comeback , @entity1 said reports that he was plotting @entity3 ’s downfall were ‘ twaddle ’			1
but he refused to rule out a @entity27 return before the next election , due in 2015			1
@entity1 says his anti-strike blueprint is designed to support @entity3 ’s drive to boost the economy , but it is bound to be seen as a riposte to critics who say he lacks the substance needed to be @entity38 leader			1
and it could lead to a new clash with the prime minister , who believes the proposals ‘ go too far ’ and could increase the likelihood of a general strike			2
the mayor ’s supporters say his proposals are the ‘ @entity49 equivalent ’ of the union reforms pioneered by @entity51 and @entity52 in the @entity53			1
the reforms would outlaw strikes unless a 50 per cent threshold of members take part in a vote ; ban all - out strikes among key public - service workers such as paramedics , firefighters and transport staff ; force key public services to maintain a basic service and stop pickets intimidating workers			0
@entity1 ’s proposals come after he was forced to pay huge bonuses to @entity12 bus drivers and tube drivers to stop them going on strike during the @entity74			1
he has clashed repeatedly with @entity75 , leader of the @entity78 ( @entity77 ) union , one of the last old - style militant union barons			0
burly @entity75 is accused of staging strike ballots involving a tiny fraction of his members and @entity77 officials have been accused of heavy - handed picketing			0
@entity1 praised @entity12 transport workers for their ‘ brilliant ’ performance during the @entity74 , saying : ‘ they served the city well and made everyone incredibly proud			1
’ but , frustrated by his inability to change the law , he wants @entity3 to rein in @entity94 dismissed : in his first major interview since his secret talks about making a quick commons comeback were revealed , @entity1 said reports that he was plotting @entity3 's downfall were ' twaddle ' adopting a new statesmanlike tone , @entity1 condemned last week ’s call by the @entity102 for a general strike over the government ’s public - sector pay freeze			1
he said : ‘ we ’re going through difficult economic times			0
people have got to be able to go about their business			0
it [ a general strike ] would be damaging to the economy , it ’s not in the interests of unions or their members and it is unlikely to carry much support			0
‘ what we do n’t want to see as unions start to flex their muscles in the autumn is a return to the unfair and unnecessary strikes and ballots that put a terrific psychological burden on people who do n’t want to take strike action			1
‘ there are hard - working people on @entity12 ’s transport system who are unnerved by what is going on			1
there are intimidating people who stop them getting to work , or a strike is called on the basis of a very small proportion of the relevant workforce			0
that is not fair on them or their families			0
’ it is time to adopt tough , @entity142 - style anti-strike laws , said @entity1 , who was born in @entity143			1
‘ in @entity143 , not just emergency workers but mass - transit workers [ the @entity143 underground ] are n’t allowed to strike at all			0
in cities like @entity149 , they have minimum service requirements that mean even if there is industrial action , a certain basic service has to be provided			0
all those ideas are worth looking at			0
’ battles : @entity1 has clashed repeatedly with @entity75 , pictured , the leader of the @entity78 ( @entity77 ) union and one of the last old - style militant union barons @entity1 said a total ban on public - sector strikes is ‘ not realistic , ’ adding : ‘ people have a human right to withdraw their labour			1
but we have to think very carefully about how it is done and the effect on people who are n’t in the ballot and suddenly find they ’re co-opted into a strike they do n’t support			0
’ @entity1 wants his anti-strike package included in the government ’s economic growth @entity173 , which is due to be introduced in @entity175 in the next few weeks			1
‘ it ’s got to be seen in the context of a general agenda for growth and jobs – that is what people want , a solid drive			2
the job of the @entity184 is to free the private sector from excessive taxation and regulation by providing the essential framework of safety and infrastructure to allow business to flourish			0
’ but this latest intervention could cause a new @entity194 rift			0
the @entity195 understands the prime minister believes there is no need for tough nationwide anti-strike laws because it is a ‘ @entity12 problem ’ caused mainly by @entity75			1
a no 10 insider said : ‘ most unions are a busted flush			0
‘ if we give @entity1 everything he wants , it could backfire			1
’ @entity3 wants a ‘ watered down ’ version of the mayor ’s strike - vote threshold plan , although the chancellor , @entity209 , is backing @entity1			1
the mayor is determined to win his latest tussle with @entity3			2
‘ it makes a big difference what you go for			0
we ’re asking for a 50 per cent threshold			0
’ he denies declaring war on the unions			0
‘ i ’m very keen not to seem adversarial towards the unions or to be doing this in an aggressive spirit			0
’ he defends his proposals : ‘ what it does is take away unions ’ power to cause endless grief and stress by threatening strikes and causing endless disruption and buggeration			2
’ it comes a week after this newspaper revealed how @entity1 met @entity235 mp @entity234 and discussed the mayor taking over @entity238 ’s seat in a by - election on an @entity241 third runway ticket			1
this sparked frenzied speculation about a @entity1 leadership challenge against @entity3			1
@entity1 ’s spokesman played down the report , saying it was ‘ fanciful			1
’ in fact , according to a very reliable witness , the mayor panicked when told that his talks with @entity238 had been leaked			2
as he agonised over whether to confirm or deny the report , he exclaimed : ‘ i ca n’t lie ! i ca n’t lie ! ’ he was sacked by former @entity254 leader @entity253 in 2004 for lying about his affair with writer @entity256			2
it was a fib to this newspaper that sealed his fate			0
wisely , this time , he did not lie , and told officials to confirm the @entity238 talks , while doing his best to limit the embarrassment of being caught red - handed			0
asked point - blank if he is undermining @entity3 , @entity263 the statesman resorts to his usual self - parody and bluster to get off the hook			2
he finally replies with characteristically colourful – and disarming – hyperbole : ‘ it is self - evident twaddle			2
as everybody remembers , i was one of the first in the tiny taxiful of supporters to back @entity3 in 2005			2
changes : it is time to adopt tough , @entity142 - style anti-strike laws , said @entity1 , who was born in @entity143 , pictured ‘ he ’s a winner			1
he ’ll win an election outright in 2015			2
i remain a big backer of his and i ’ve got four years of hard work here in @entity12			0
’ yet even when he is swearing allegiance to the pm , @entity1 makes it sound insincere by referring to @entity3 ’s ‘ tiny taxiful of supporters ’			1
put on the spot over whether he will rule out a @entity27 return before the next general election , due in 2015 – crucially , before his term as mayor ends in 2016 – @entity1 the clown throws up another cloud of chaff			1
will he or wo n’t he rule it out ? a simple ‘ @entity298 ’ will do			2
he has done it in the past , but appears reluctant to do so now			0
it ’s back to @entity1 the bogus bumbler , ducking and diving with the mock flattery and self - deprecation that has allowed him to rewrite the rulebook of political and personal conduct			2
‘ @entity0 , i ’m going to regretfully and respectfully , with deep respect and continued admiration for you and your style and interrogatory methods from which i ’ve learned so much over the past 20 years , i ’m going to respectfully , i ’m going to see if i can meet mr @entity311 , who ’s pounding my door to come and invest in @entity12			1
ok matey ? ’ and with that , he was off to meet @entity314 , chairman of the @entity315 , the world ’s 13th largest company .			0

the @entity12 mayor called on @entity3 to pull @entity13 out of the slump by clamping down on strikes
@entity1 said reports that he was plotting @entity3 ’s downfall were ‘ twaddle ’
