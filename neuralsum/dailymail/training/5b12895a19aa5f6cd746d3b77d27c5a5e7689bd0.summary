by @entity0 the owners of a rare antique steam engine could face a £ 100,000 repair bill after the machine slipped off the back of a lorry and was badly damaged			1
the 21 - tonne @entity8 engine , named the ' @entity9 ' , which was made in 1917 , missed an electric pylon by inches after falling off the low loader as it went around a blind bend			1
the ploughing engine 's flywheel , boiler and steering mechanism were damaged in the accident in @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21			1
the 21 - tonne steam engine @entity9 , which dates back to 1917 , was badly damaged after falling from the back of a lorry as it drove around a blind corner in @entity20 , @entity21 the engine 's flywheel , boiler and steering were damaged in the crash and could cost up to £ 100,000 to repair , according to @entity32 , which owns the vehicle the lorry was driving the engine back from the @entity36 , near @entity37 , where it had made its first appearance since being lovingly restored by the farm @entity32 , which owns the ploughing engine , had spent five years restoring the historic engine to working condition before the crash			1
the farm owners also restored its sister engine , @entity47 , also dating back to 1917 , which works in tandem with the @entity9			1
spokesman @entity50 told @entity51 that the steam engine - which must work in a pair - arrived back to the farm this morning and a mechanic was starting repair work today			1
she said : ' the engine has pride of place in our show every year			1
we do n't know the exact damage but we are expecting to look at around £ 100,000			1
' the plan is to repair it if we can and we are hoping to have it fixed by the time of the @entity66 , in september			1
' the engines work in a pair so must go together			0
although there are more ploughing machines around , it is so rare to get the exact pair so we really hope we can get it working again			1
' the crash took place around 7.30pm , but the machine was not recovered for another five hours because those removing it had to be so careful not to do further damage to the antique model the drama unfolded on sunday evening as the steam engine was being brought back from the @entity36 , near @entity37 , where it made its first appearance since being restored			1
after the crash , four cranes worked through the night to recover the steam engine			1
because of its age , recovery workers had to treat the machine delicately to ensure there was no further damage			2
it was finally moved at 1.30am the following morning			0
@entity95 , 59 , who lives close to where the accident took place , told @entity99 : ' i was standing in the lounge looking out the window and saw it coming round the corner			0
' the next minute there was a crash and it fell off			2
i came straight out and it was steaming			0
the steam engine is one of two ploughing engines owned by the farm which owners hope will make an appearance at the @entity66 in september the rare vehicle works in tandem with its sister engine , @entity47 , which has also been restored by the farm			1
both vehicles work to plough a field , one pulling from the left and the other pulling from the right the @entity9 is one of the ploughing machines famously created by @entity8 in @entity125			0
there are still around 3,000 @entity8 machines in preservation			0
of these , it is believed a few hundreds are ploughing engines , although it is believed there are just a handful that were also made in 1917			2
the two - gear engine , labelled as the 14729 , works in tandem with its sister engine @entity47 , which also dates back to 1917 and is labelled as the 14728			1
located on either side of a field , the engines are designed to pull a plough , or a scoop on a cable , backwards and forwards across a paddock , travelling at around 4mph			0
the engines are identical except that one engine pulled the rope from the right and the other from the left			2
the paired engine system was developed because the heavy traction engines caused the soil to be heavily compressed if driven across a paddock pulling a plough			2
' i was concerned someone was hurt so i went to see if the driver was okay and he was alright			0
a few people called 999 to get the police out			0
' it was a nightmare - they had four really big cranes and the road blocked off			2
it was very lucky that no one was on the verge and that it did n’t take any power lines down with it			0
' everyone was down here – no less than 50 people with the road closed off			0
' as well as damage to the vehicle , the kerb , a chevron sign and the grass verge were all damaged			2
passerby @entity176 of @entity177 , @entity20 , said : ' it will have done a lot of damage to the engine			1
luckily it fell onto the grass verge rather than the road and no one was walking on it			0
' a police spokesman said : ' officers attended and assisted with traffic management			0
the road was subsequently closed completely while the steam engine was recovered			0
it was fully reopened at 1.30am			0
' @entity194 were also notified about the incident due to suspected damage to the road surface			0

the 21 - tonne engine , built in 1917 , fell from the lorry in @entity20 , @entity21
its flywheel , boiler and steering are damaged and could cost £ 100,000 to repair
owners hope machine is fixed in time for @entity66 in september
