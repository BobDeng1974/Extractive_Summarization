by @entity0 published : 04:45 est , 23 july 2012 updated : 07:30 est , 23 july 2012 tummy troubles : there is increasing concern that climate change may be driving bacterial waterborne infectious diseases climate change could be driving an increase in illnesses such as cholera and gastroenteritis in northern @entity11 , scientists have warned			1
a rise in temperatures in the @entity14 has triggered the growth of the water - borne bacteria @entity18			1
the bacteria , which is passed to humans by eating raw or undercooked shellfish or from exposure to seawater , can cause various infections , ranging from cholera to gastroenteritis - like symptoms			1
an international team examined sea surface temperature records and satellite data in the @entity14 , as well as statistics on @entity18 cases in the region			1
the bacteria usually grow in warm and tropical marine environments , and the researchers found the number and distribution of cases in the @entity14 area was linked to peaks in sea surface temperatures			1
for each year that the temperature rose by one degree , the number of vibrio cases rose by almost 200 per cent			2
the study focused on the @entity14 in particular because it warmed at an unprecedented rate of 0.063 to 0.078 degrees celsius a year from 1982 to 2010 , or 6.3 to 7.8 degrees a century			1
study author @entity44 from the @entity45 - based @entity46 , said : ' the big apparent increases that we 've seen in cases during heat wave years ... tend to indicate that climate change is indeed driving infections			0
' climate studies suggest that rising greenhouse gas emissions made global average surface temperatures increase by about 0.17 degrees celsius a decade from 1980 to 2010			0
' ( it ) represents , to our knowledge , the fastest warming marine ecosystem examined so far anywhere on @entity61 , ' the paper said			0
many marine bacteria thrive in warm , low - saline sea water			1
in addition to warming , climate change has caused more frequent and heavier rainfall , which has reduced the salt content of estuaries and coastal wetlands			0
@entity71 - some strains can cause cholera : each year the temperature rose one degree , the number of vibrio cases rose almost 200 per cent as ocean temperatures continue to rise and coastal regions in northern regions become less saline , @entity18 bacteria strains will appear in new areas , the scientists said			1
vibrio outbreaks have also appeared in temperate and cold regions in @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , the northwest @entity92 @entity91 and northwest @entity93 , and these can be linked to warming patterns , the scientists said			2
rising temperatures : the @entity14 represents the ' fastest warming marine eco-system examined so far anywhere on earth ' ' very few studies have looked at the risk of these infections at high latitudes , ' @entity44 said			2
' certainly the chances of getting a vibrio infection are considered to be relatively low , and more research is focused on areas where these diseases are endemic or at least more common , ' he added			2
previous @entity71 outbreaks in colder regions have often been put down to a sporadic event or special conditions rather than a response to long - term climate change			0
this is because the effects of global warming can be more pronounced at higher latitudes and in areas which lack detailed historical climate data , the study said			0
writing in the journal @entity121 the authors , from @entity45 , @entity123 , @entity93 and the @entity92 , said : ' there is increasing concern regarding the role of climate change in driving bacterial waterborne infectious diseases			0
' however @entity44 added a note of caution saying there are still ' huge data gaps in that area which need addressing			0

vibrio bacteria , which is normally found growing in warm and tropical waters , now thrives in the @entity14
bacteria strains will *multiply* as seas warm , *predict* researchers
the bacteria causes illnesses from cholera to gastroenteritis
