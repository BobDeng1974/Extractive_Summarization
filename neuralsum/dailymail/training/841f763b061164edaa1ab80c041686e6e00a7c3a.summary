by @entity0 there have been nine @entity3 players to try their luck in @entity6 ’s @entity5 since 1990			1
his first alongside @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 was moderately successful and he returned the following year to the disapproval of fans at his parent club , @entity37			2
@entity17 played against @entity38 in the @entity39 but then tore his left @entity40 against @entity41 and was ruled out of the @entity30			2
verdict : fail big club : @entity17 poses in @entity23 's famous trophy room ahead of his unveiling at the @entity45 same old : @entity17 bends in one of his famous free kicks in a game against former club @entity38 injury : but his second spell in @entity23 ended in agony as he tore his @entity40 against @entity41 @entity52 – @entity53 ( 2003 - 05 ) games : 28 , goals : 5 @entity56 was just 21 when he made the eye - catching move from @entity59 to @entity60 the football did n’t go great – he returned to @entity31 for a loan spell with @entity63 the year after he left – it was an interesting life experience , befriending @entity65 ’s son @entity64 who was also on @entity53 ’s books and collecting the shirts of illustrious opponents like @entity69 and @entity70			1
verdict : fail high flyer : @entity56 fights it out with @entity73 of @entity74 in an @entity76 game useful : during his brief spell in @entity5 the former @entity59 hitman managed to bag five goals battler : @entity56 fights for the ball against @entity83 's @entity82 in a @entity85 tie @entity86 – @entity87 ( 1996 - 98 ) games : 6 , goals : 0 @entity90 , the former speed king of @entity91 , was pushing 30 when he went to @entity6 with lowly @entity87 and hardly made a big impression			1
he joined on a free transfer from @entity94 but after just a handful of games was back in @entity31 to play on loan at @entity98			0
verdict : fail transformation : @entity90 was the king of speed for @entity91 but was a flop at @entity87 @entity102 – @entity104 / @entity103 ( 1997 - 98 ) games : 12 , goals : 4 arguably @entity5 ’s unlikeliest @entity3 import , @entity104 thought the 6ft4ins @entity102 would give them something different up front but the former @entity112 striker ’s technical limitations meant he did n’t last			1
@entity113 signed @entity102 but left soon after the striker arrived , so he went on loan to @entity103			0
verdict : fail on the rocks : @entity102 had spells at @entity104 and @entity103 boy in blue : @entity102 shows his colours in a @entity104 photoshoot @entity122 – @entity123 ( 1992 - 95 ) games : 43 , goals : 6 to tell the whole story , you ’d need to write a book			0
@entity122 arrived in @entity129 a year after originally planned after rupturing his cruciate in the 1991 fa cup final			0
his time in @entity6 was dogged with injury and weight problems but he scored a vital goal in the derby against @entity14 and is still idolised by @entity123 fans			2
verdict : success fans ' man : @entity122 instantly made himself popular with @entity123 fans after turning up in this outfit culture : the @entity3 box of tricks poses in front of @entity129 's @entity146 after signing from @entity147 hero : @entity149 scored against @entity14 which means he is still loved by @entity123 fans to this day @entity150 – @entity23 ( 1995 - 97 ) games : 54 , goals : 10 @entity38 ’s self - styled @entity153 showed he could walk the walk by impressing in @entity5 under future @entity31 manager @entity155			1
@entity156 rose above the racist taunting that came from sections of @entity13 crowds and helped the club finish third in the league and reach the @entity85 final , which they lost to @entity163 on penalties			0
@entity23 wanted him to stay longer but he returned home to sign for @entity166			0
verdict : success excitement : @entity156 poses with his adidas boots and an @entity23 shirt as he signs in 1995 popular : @entity23 wanted to keep hold of @entity156 but he decided to return to @entity31 with @entity166 @entity171 – @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity104 ( 1991 - 95 ) games : 100 , goals : 31 probably @entity31 ’s most successful player in @entity6 , @entity176 was signed by @entity172 from @entity94 in the @entity179 boom and did so well he ended up moving on to @entity173 and then @entity104 , who valued his goalscoring prowess from midfield			1
the highlight came at @entity104 when he won the @entity184 under @entity113 and developed a close friendship with team - mate @entity186			0
unlike many @entity187 , @entity176 became a fluent @entity13 - speaker which helped him settle on and off the field			0
verdict : success @entity192 abroad : @entity176 in action for @entity172 during a @entity5 match in 1991 winner : @entity176 picks up the @entity85 during his time with @entity173 in 1990 trilogy : @entity176 makes a run for his third @entity13 club , @entity104 @entity200 – @entity104 ( 1998 - 99 ) games : 3 , goals : 0 @entity200 was recovering from a bad knee injury and past his @entity38 prime when @entity205 allowed him to go out on loan to @entity6			1
he played only three games and returned to @entity31 after a few months , signing for @entity208			0
verdict : fail flop : @entity200 watches on from the stands after signing for @entity104 on loan reject : @entity200 made a quick return to @entity208 in @entity31 after an unsuccessful spell in @entity6 @entity213 – @entity104 ( 1992 - 93 ) games : 30 , goals : 0 it was quite an honour for a leading club in @entity6 , where defending is regarded as an art form , to sign an @entity3 centre half from @entity91			1
unfortunately , the move coincided with @entity213 starting to lose his famed pace and confidence			1
he played mainly left back in @entity223 and soon his @entity31 career was over too , making his last international appearance at the age of 27			0
verdict : fail happy days : @entity213 poses in a @entity104 shirt after signing back in 1992 towards the end of his career hard man : former @entity31 centre back @entity213 playing for @entity104 in 1992			2

from @entity213 to @entity17 , the @entity3 have tried their luck in @entity5 a few times over the last *24* years
@entity8 becomes the 10th @entity3 player to move to @entity6 in that period
