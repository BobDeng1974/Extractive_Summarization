every time you drive , you ’re spied on			2
countless thousands of cameras monitor your speed and record your car ’s number plate			1
and there are at least 20 kinds — some gathering data for experts to analyse , others helping police catch criminals and manage traffic flow			1
but the most despised are those supposed to ‘ improve road safety ’ , which seem to be little more than fine machines			2
each year , £ 284 million is collected in speeding fines			1
recently , it was revealed that one , called the @entity21 , trapped 668 drivers on a stretch of the @entity24 in @entity25 in ten days			1
so who gets the cash ? most of the money goes to the @entity30			2
your fine might not improve the road where you were caught , but you may help to cut the national debt			2
here , @entity35 helps you navigate your way past all the cameras			1
@entity38 these rear - facing devices use radar to record a vehicle ’s speed			1
a radio signal is sent from the machine to the vehicle , which is then reflected back by the vehicle			2
the time between the signal being sent and being passed back is timed			2
a second signal is sent out and comes back , and is also timed			2
the difference enables the @entity38 to establish how quickly the vehicle has travelled between the two points			2
if the vehicle is going above the speed limit , the camera takes several pictures			2
white lines on the road are markers to show how fast the vehicle has travelled			0
newer cameras record images digitally , and beam them to the enforcement office			1
locations : all over the country , particularly near accident black - spots			0
@entity66 a camera that ’s linked to four sensors embedded in the road and is able to calculate how fast a vehicle has passed over them			0
a series of pictures is taken from the front — thus capturing a photo of the driver			0
locations : from the @entity78 such as @entity79 up to places such as @entity81			0
@entity66 d - @entity82 updated version of the basic @entity66 that employs lasers and can transmit images wirelessly to a central office — thereby removing the need for film in the camera , which requires to be changed often — as is the case with the @entity38			0
of course , it needs less staff and increases the capacity to catch speeders			1
locations : not common - currently found in @entity96 - but many more on their way			0
@entity99 uses @entity100 , and the 1,000 cameras currently being used can be linked so as to monitor a motorist ’s whole journey on main roads across the country			1
locations : currently on trial in @entity109 , @entity79			0
mobile camera operated by police officers — these devices are hand - held or mounted in vans that are normally parked in lay - bys			1
the cameras either use laser or radar technology			1
locations : could surprise you anywhere in the @entity120			1
@entity121 3 introduced last year by the @entity122			1
we were told the cameras would primarily be used for ‘ smoothing traffic flow and increasing [ motorway ] capacity ’			1
but it seems they are mostly used as a speed camera			0
they record average speed over a specific distance			0
unlike other average speed cameras , the @entity134 is painted grey not yellow , making it hard to spot — raising concerns that it is more about revenue than safety			1
this would seem at odds with the 2001 law that required all speed cameras to be painted @entity147 yellow to avoid concerns that the cameras were nothing more than hidden revenue raisers			1
the @entity21 camera uses radar to monitor several lanes of traffic			1
locations : known to be on the @entity24 in @entity25			0
more planned for the @entity157 in @entity79 and @entity158 , the @entity159 in @entity160 and @entity96 , and the @entity161 around @entity162			0
@entity163 able to monitor four lanes simultaneously , sets of these cameras are mounted on gantries			1
these are equipped with @entity100 ( @entity100 ) and photograph every vehicle that passes beneath them			0
the data is then sent to another set of cameras further down the road ( a minimum of 200m away )			1
the time that it takes for the vehicle to travel between these two set points is established , and as a result , a motorist ’s average speed between the two points is worked out			0
fitted with infra - red illuminators , they work night and day , and in all weathers			0
locations : motorways and dual carriageways all over the country			0
@entity191 a private firm that uses roadside cameras to monitor traffic speeds and congestion levels			1
information is sent to drivers whose satellite navigation systems have @entity199 built in — including popular sat - nav brands such as @entity201 and @entity202			0
this helps the sat - nav to avoid jams			0
police could get a court order to force @entity199 to hand over data , but they ’d be unlikely to do so for speeding offences			1
locations : on all major roads			2
@entity211 similar to the @entity38 , it uses radar to measure a vehicle ’s speed			0
if the vehicle is going too fast , it takes pictures of the rear of the vehicle			0
locations : more common in built - up areas , but particularly found in @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225			0
vector primarily intended for controlling average speeds , they can also monitor box junctions and bus lanes for traffic infringements and police congestion zones			1
data is transmitted instantly back to an enforcement team			2
locations : so new that only a few have so far been spotted — in @entity25			0
@entity122 cctv its 1,500 cameras on @entity242 ’s roads ‘ assist with management of traffic ’			1
they record traffic flow and how roads cope with it			1
cameras do n’t store data on individual vehicles			1
the agency also uses 1,100 @entity100 cameras that monitor an estimated 14 million vehicles a day			1
not used for fines , data not shared with police			1
locations : motorways and major a-roads			0
@entity259 uses sensors embedded in the road to trigger a camera to take a photo if a vehicle has passed over them too quickly			0
in addition , markings on the side of the road also provide photographic evidence of how quickly a car has been travelling between the markings			0
traffic light camera whenever a traffic light turns red , the camera takes a picture of any car that passes illegally beneath it — and can calculate its speed			2
locations : all over the country			0
@entity284 and @entity285 cameras the @entity284 cameras check vehicles for which the excise duty ( tax disc ) has not been paid			2
however , the @entity284 ( which keeps registers of all drivers and vehicles in @entity120 ) and the @entity285 ( @entity285 ) share data			1
the @entity285 was created in 2013			0
its responsibility is to improve road safety by setting standards for driving and motorcycling			0
as well as sharing information with the @entity284 , it has a network of mobile and static cameras to monitor whether goods vehicles have paid the @entity304			1
introduced nine months ago , the system has raised £ 500,000 in fines			1
@entity308 cameras are placed in police vans or unmarked cars , where they are fed data from a series of sensors embedded in the road			1
these sensors , which are visible ( like those pictured above ) are sometimes also marked by several short grey poles at the side of the road			0
information from them is transmitted to police positioned further down the road , who can then stop the speeding car and issue an on - the - spot fine			2
locations : anywhere and everywhere			0
@entity329 these record number plates of every passing vehicle , then store information to ‘ help detect , deter and disrupt criminality at a local , force , regional and national level ’			2
records can be accessed for up to two years			0
if a vehicle is of interest to police , officers monitoring it can order a patrol car team to stop the driver and , if necessary , make an arrest			0

some cameras are used to catch criminals , monitor traffic , or collect data
but large number are used to issue fines which total £ *284million* each year
