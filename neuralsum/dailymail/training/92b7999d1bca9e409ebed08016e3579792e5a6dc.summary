by @entity0 published : 13:53 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 15:58 est , 11 september 2012 a historic saddle used by @entity2 and once owned by the late writer @entity3 , who joked it holds a bizarre and terrible curse , is expected to fetch more than £ 10,000 at auction			1
the emerald green quilted saddlecloth , used by the @entity2 on a royal visit to @entity9 in 1574 , will go under the hammer at @entity12 ’ sale of militaria at @entity14 near @entity15 , @entity16 , on september 26			1
it is elaborately decorated with gold lace and a gold fringe and has been an heirloom in the @entity3 family for generations			1
by @entity24 appointment : the saddle used by @entity2 on her state visit to @entity9 in 1574			1
it was owned by writer @entity3 who joked it held a terrible curse @entity30 used the saddle as she rode through the cobbled streets of @entity9 in a spectacular procession in 1574 where she watched a three - day mock battle and received a £ 100 gift of gold from the city leaders			1
@entity3 , a brilliant columnist who wrote for @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 was best - known for his hilarious @entity43 ’s @entity42 ! books , before his death from cancer four years ago , aged 66			1
but the man who once sent an urgent telegram from @entity51 ‘ @entity50 here very warm , please send ice , ’ kept @entity46 a closely - guarded secret - until now			0
the saddlecloth is estimated to sell for £ 8,000 to £ 10,000 when it goes under the hammer and there will be an added bonus for the successful bidder			2
for @entity3 explained the untold story of @entity46 , in his own inimitable style , to his wife @entity60 shortly before his death and a copy will be included in the sale			1
two former owners : the late wit @entity3 , left , and queen elizabeth i seen in a 16th century portrait @entity69 ’ militaria specialist @entity68 said : ' queen elizabeth i ’s saddlecloth is an absolutely unique @entity24 artefact from the elizabethan era			1
' it is in extremely good condition considering it is 438 years old , and we are expecting a lot of international interest			0
' it is mounted in a glass display case and bears a plaque which states ‘ @entity30 ’s @entity46 , on which she rode on her state visit to @entity9 1574			1
@entity84 presented to a member of the @entity3 family ’			1
' in the note to his wife , @entity3 wrote : ' my dear @entity60 , i sometimes worry that i may pass on to the other side before i have handed down to you the secret of the @entity93			1
' @entity99 , i know , as the doctor has said given reasonable treatment and a visit to the pub every now and then , there ’s no reason why i should n’t last another 40 years , but nevertheless i think perhaps the time has come to tell the dread secret of the @entity93			2
' but it ’s just a silly old priceless family heirloom sitting in an old glass case , i hear you laugh			2
' there ’s nothing secret about it at all ...			0
ah , would that it were so			0
history : the saddle , which was passed down from generation to generation of the @entity3 family , is expected to fetch more than £ 10,000 when it goes under the hammer at auction later this month ' but this @entity93 has been handed down through eight or nine of maybe seventeen generations of the @entity3 family , all of whom are now dead			1
' yes , every single previous owner of the @entity93 is now in another place , and it ’s not @entity123 i ’m talking about			0
' why do you think they were all struck down before they reached 100 ? why do you think nobody ever gets the @entity93 out and rides around on it on a horse ? ' why , above all , do you think nobody ever wants to have it in their house , and everyone whispers furtively : ‘ let ’s give it to cousin @entity137 ... let ’s put it in a museum ... ? ’ ' i ’ll tell you			0
' it ’s because of the curse of the @entity93			2
the curse which has scattered the family far afield , from @entity146 to @entity147 , from @entity147 to @entity148 , and from @entity148 to a crazy steam railway between @entity150 and @entity151 only five miles long , for @entity153 ’s sake			2
' as a child i remember getting a really nasty sore throat and my father leaning over my bed and saying ‘ the curse of the @entity93 has got him , we must apply the only known antidote , mother , give me a corkscrew - yes , at the age of ten my life was saved by red wine and i have never looked back since , but that is another story			0
' i am surprised that you have never noticed that none of the @entity168 ever rides a horse			0
' there is a good reason for this			0
none of us can ever ride a horse because of the secret of the @entity93 , and were any of us to mount a horse , it would mean instant death			0
' my grand - father , @entity181 , mounted a horse for the regimental race in 1907			0
it collapsed on the starting - line and my grand - mother lost a lot of money			0
' my great - great - grandfather colonel @entity3 took part in the @entity190 , and had not gone 5 yards before his mount keeled over , dead , badly creasing his trousers			2
' my great - great - great ...			0
