by @entity1 reporter published : 16:51 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 16:51 est , 5 august 2013 bright red braces - the ultimate status symbol of the @entity6 ’s ' greed is good ' culture during the @entity7 years - have finally fallen out of fashion			1
the garish accessories , sported by @entity10 as ruthless @entity11 in @entity12 , once summed up the brash ' @entity15 casino ' culture			2
however , red braces have fallen spectacularly from grace and demand has plummeted as @entity6 wheelers and dealers seek to portray themselves as ' a safe pair of hands '			1
red braces first shot to prominence in @entity15 after deregulation and the release of the 1987 blockbuster movie @entity12			1
actor @entity10 is pictured here , sporting the red braces , as brash @entity11 in the movie for the first time in almost 30 years , department store @entity31 now stocks just one pair			1
instead its most popular braces are now risk averse grey , traditional bank manager dark blue and sombre serious black			0
@entity31 spokesman @entity38 : ' the days when @entity11 was a fashion symbol in the @entity6 has come to an end			2
' @entity6 workers are abandoning styles once associated with flamboyant deal making and opting instead for colours which enhance the impression of being a safe pair of hands			2
' red braces first shot to prominence in the @entity15 after deregulation and the release of the blockbuster 1987 movie @entity12			1
out went bowler hats , three piece suits and roiled up umbrellas as a new breed of trader , banker and analyst swept more conservative dressers aside			0
times have changed : instead of red braces , business leaders now wear ' risk averse ' grey or blue ties for a more serious look ( as shown by model ) with fortunes being made on the back of high risk investments , red braces became a virtual uniform as highly competitive teams decided that they too could be like @entity11			1
mr @entity38 said : ' our sales figures show that bright red braces first went into decline in 2008 when so many banks collapsed			2
' the decline became even more severe the following year as more people began to realise that this was not a temporary blip and the reasons for the crash began to emerge			0
' suddenly flamboyance and risk taking became bad words , and @entity6 workers , eager to distance themselves from that culture , switched to conservative colours instead			1
' now our two top selling braces are both traditional grey - one is a light grey with pin dots and the other dark grey with subtle diagonal stripes			0
' he added : ' the message they send out is clear - it is one of trust , caution , and a highly conservative approach to handling money			0
' it is safe to say that neither would have featured in @entity11 ’s wardrobe			0
' our next most popular colour for braces is beige			0
we ’re assuming that these are now the braces of choice when today ’s bankers really want to let their hair down			0
