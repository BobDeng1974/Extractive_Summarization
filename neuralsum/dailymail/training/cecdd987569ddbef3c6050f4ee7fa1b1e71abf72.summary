@entity12 told me that he talked to her about the puppies and the other animals at my house here , our wonderful garden and the new pope			2

i used to adore having her to stay here with me in @entity19			0
room : @entity6 had been staying in this suite at the @entity134 in @entity135 , where she had been living since @entity136 as she recovered from an operation , and this is where she watched the puppy video ' we would pick cherries together and i would drive her about on a little electric cart i have at the house as sometimes she could n't manage the walk			2
we had fun talking with the animals and playing with them			0
' @entity6 adored animals and all of my mine are named after famous politicians - i 've got a cross alsatian called @entity79 and i even have a bossy goose called @entity6 who ended up killing one of the roosters			0
