by @entity0 published : 05:19 est , 6 september 2012 updated : 05:44 est , 6 september 2012 the sheer scale of worklessness in @entity3 was laid bare today as one in three households in some cities are completely jobless			1
@entity7 has the highest rate for the fourth year running with more than 50,000 homes in this dire situation , and some contain families who have never worked a day in their lives			2
experts say that former industrial areas of the @entity3 have hundreds of thousands of households with generations of people who have been out of work for up to 40 years			2
best and worst : new figures have shown the scale of unemployed households in some areas of @entity3 official figures released by the @entity25 paint a depressing regional picture , with communities in the north - east , @entity28 , @entity29 and parts of @entity31 having the largest number of completely unemployed homes			0
in @entity7 homes , with someone aged between 16 and 64 , 31.6 per cent of them were completely workless in 2011			2
@entity37 , which includes @entity38 and @entity39 , had a 29.1 per cent rate - the second highest percentage - up from a ranking of fourth a year earlier			1
the highest percentage of workless households in @entity28 was in the @entity45 , and this area was the third highest across the @entity3 , where 28.7 per cent of households were workless			1
deprived : @entity7 is one of the poorest areas of @entity3 and has consistently had the highest unemployed household rates @entity51 topped in @entity29 and has the fourth highest rate in @entity3 at 28.7 per cent , followed by @entity53 , which completed the top five			1
the main reasons given by people was long term sickness , disability or just not being able to get a job			0
' the common link among the areas within the top five is that they were all heavily industrialised in the last century , ' the @entity25 said today , ' @entity7 had a large manufacturing base and one of the @entity3 ’s largest docks , which have both been in decline since the 1970s			2
@entity37 has also seen a decline in the heavy industries that dominated the area in the last century			0
the @entity71 were once one of the @entity3 ’s largest coal producers , most of which no longer exists			0
' @entity51 was once a major force in shipbuilding as well as other engineering but competition overseas has seen that decline since the 1960s			0
finally @entity53 was also affected by the loss of shipbuilding and coal mining as seen is some of the other areas			0
' up and down : this official graph shows how areas with historic levels of worklessness have fared over the years and where they were ranked up to 2011 in 2011 , the lowest percentage of workless households in the @entity3 were mainly concentrated in the south of @entity91			1
@entity92 had the lowest percentage , at eight per cent followed by @entity94 , on 9.8 per cent			1
both these areas have commonly had low rates of workless households since records began in 2004			1
@entity98 was the area with the third lowest workless households in 2011 at 10.9 per cent			1

the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) said this was 3.7 million in 2012 - down 153,000 on a year earlier			2
