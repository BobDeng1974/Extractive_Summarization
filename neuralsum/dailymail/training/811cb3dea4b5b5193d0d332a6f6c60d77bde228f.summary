by @entity0 published : 05:15 est , 9 june 2014 updated : 04:22 est , 10 june 2014 @entity2 , the wife of a @entity4 passenger , is disgusted by the release of the fictional book about the missing plane just three months after the mysterious disappearance furious families of @entity4 passengers have slammed a controversial new novel that uses the doomed airliner as a plot line - just three months after the plane vanished on march 8			1
@entity2 , the wife of missing @entity16 , told the @entity17 she was angered and disgusted by @entity19 's release of the fictional novella , @entity4 , so soon after the tragedy before knowing all of the facts			1
‘ i 'd rather they 'd put their efforts to helping them find the truth , to be honest , " she said			1
' we 're going to be spending the rest of our lives doing that			0
' @entity19 , who is based in @entity30 , said he never intended for the book 's audience to be the relatives of the missing passengers or for them to even find out about it			1
he said he was n't writing the piece for the families and wanted to apologise to ms weeks			2
‘ i 'm saddened to hear that she 's reacted like that , i 'm upset that she 's upset , ' he said			2
meanwhile , the relatives of the @entity4 passengers wo n't rest until they have answers about what happened to the plane , even announcing a plan to crowd - fund $ 5m to ' encourage a whistleblower ' to come forward to shed some light on what they believe has become a cover up			1
despite @entity30 's plans to send a team to @entity54 to finalise the next search phase of the missing plane on tuesday , relatives of passengers have decided to take investigations into their own hands			1
the @entity4 campaign is being spearheaded by an @entity61 businessman , @entity60 , who lives in @entity62 but has no connection with any of the passengers			1
despite intensive aviation and police investigations , authorities have been unable to explain why the plane carrying 239 passengers made a sudden turn westward and vanished			1
@entity2 , right , with her husband @entity16 who was aboard the @entity4 that vanished on march 8 @entity4 a novella , released by @entity19 , has hit a nerve with relatives of the passengers @entity75 , whose partner @entity76 was on board , said families wanted to look at the tragedy with ‘ a fresh set of eyes ’			1
‘ governments and agencies have given it their best shot but have failed to turn up a single shred of evidence , either because of a faulty approach or due to intentional misdirection by one or more individuals			2
ms weeks agreed that they had been left with no choice			0
‘ we ’ve been cut off so many times at the gate that we ’re just now having to take things into our own hands , think outside the box and just try and do something to find this plane , ’ she said			1
meanwhile , a @entity103 oil rig worker , who claimed to have seen ' @entity4 on fire ' over the @entity106 , revealed today that he had lost his job for reporting the incident			1
speaking for the first time about the sighting of a ' burning aircraft ' and the loss of his job , @entity110 remained positive about the contents of an email he had sent , in which he said : ' i believe i saw the @entity122 plane come down			2
' and he said that the ongoing search for the missing airliner raised many unanswered questions , adding : ' the investigators do not inspire trust			2
' mr @entity110 was working on the @entity131 oil rig off the southern coast of @entity133 on the night of march 8 when he saw what he believed was a burning plane			2
mr @entity110 sent an email to his employers , which in turn was leaked to the media who gained access to his name , place of work , the rig operator , @entity148 , as well as @entity110 's contractor and rig owner @entity145			0
a @entity103 oil rig worker lost his job for reporting that he claimed to have seen @entity152 on fire @entity110 claimed to have seen the aircraft ' burning ' while it was flying over the @entity106 the email address was inundated with so many inquiries that the operators ' communications became blocked			0
' this became intolerable for them and i was removed from the rig and not invited back , ' he told @entity103 's @entity163			0
he said that although he was paid up until the end of his work period , he was released from the rig five days earlier			0
mr @entity110 , a drilling fluids consultant who has worked mostly in @entity168 for the past 35 years - the last six almost continuously in @entity133 waters - is now looking for more work			0
in his email , mr @entity110 gave what appeared to be credible details of a burning plane			0
he described his exact location on the oil rig , the compass bearing of where the aircraft was in relation to the rig , the approximate distance of the plane from the rig , the current on the water surface and the wind direction			0
the plane , he said in the email , was not on the normal flight path scheduled jets flying from @entity192 to @entity193 took - a fact he knew because ' we see the contrails every day			0
' mr @entity110 signed off his email with a ' good luck ' , followed by his full name and @entity103 passport number			0
after reading the email , @entity133 authorities interviewed the @entity202 and started an initial search - but two days after speaking to him the search in the @entity106 was called off when the hunt for @entity4 switched to the @entity206 and then to the southern part of the @entity208 since then , he said , neither the @entity30 nor @entity61 search teams had contacted him			1
@entity30 will send a team of experts to @entity54 on tuesday to prepare to the next effort of the search phase the latest information and analysis confirms that @entity4 will be found in close proximity to the arc set out in this map and labelled as the 7th arc			1
at the time @entity4 reached this arc , the aircraft is considered to have exhausted its fuel and to have been descending			1
as a result , the aircraft is unlikely to be more than 20 @entity225 ( 38 km ) to the west or 30 @entity225 ( 55 km ) to the east of the arc			0
the 7th arc : the seventh arc on this globe is the area where @entity4 is thought to be			1
the arc was determined by measuring the time difference between communication messages sent between @entity4 and an @entity236 satellite just last week , @entity238 yachtswoman @entity237 , 41 , reported seeing an airliner on fire on the same night as mr @entity110 's ' burning plane ' - but she was in a totally different area , sailing east from southern @entity243 to @entity244 in southern @entity245			1
she told of seeing a plane surrounded by bright orange lights , leaving a trail of smoke as it pased above @entity250 told the @entity103 paper that his sighting placed the aircraft around 2000kms ( 1200 miles ) from the location of ms tee			0
he said he was unsure if @entity4 could have even flown that far while suffering such an obvious and devastating fire , asking : ' how far can a burning aeroplane fly ? ' a new and potentially deeper underwater search taking up to 12 months will begin in august , with a formal request for tender to undertake the search to soon be released , according to @entity262			1
meanwhile , a @entity264 vessel is currently conducting a bathymetric survey - or mapping of the ocean floor - to help experts determine how to carry out the next stage of the search on the previously unmapped ocean seabed			0
recently , there have been many claims of knowledge about the whereabouts of the missing @entity122 flight			0
@entity277 in @entity54 released information that an underwater sound recorded just 10 minutes after the plane lost contact with air traffic control could have been the plane crashing into the water			2
however , dr @entity285 from the @entity277 said there is only a 10 percent chance the ' dull oomph ' was actually @entity4			2
and a @entity238 sailor reported she spotted what she believed to be a plane on fire with black smoke trailing behind it while on a 13 month expedition with her husband			0
@entity237 said she did n't say anything at the time as she was the only one who spotted it and did n't realise it 's potential relevance			0
relatives of the 239 passengers and crew were recently successful in demanding @entity236 publicly release its data , after losing faith that searchers were looking in the right area			1
meanwhile , the @entity310 sparked renewed hope in the search for @entity4 , saying a study completed after the 2009 @entity315 crash concluded that the majority of aircraft in loss - of - control accidents were found within 32km of their last known position			2
this provides a reasonable limitation for the size of the search area across the arc			0
the satellite data indicates the @entity327 flew for six hours after falling off radar screens .			0

@entity2 , the wife a passenger aboard the @entity4 , is ' disgusted ' by the release of a fictional book on the mysterious jet
‘ i 'd rather they 'd put their efforts to helping them find the truth ' she said
relatives of passengers aboard the @entity4 are raising funds in an attempt to *unearth* new information on the missing plane
the families want the investigation to be looked at with a ' fresh set of eyes '
