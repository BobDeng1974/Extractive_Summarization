a student has set himself the goal of meeting every one of his 1088 @entity3 friends for a cup of coffee			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 , has not seen many of his social media ' friends ' for years but thought rather than delete them , he would try and catch up with one a day until he 's met them all - a task that will take him about three years			1
the 28 - year - old spoke with @entity13 about his motivation for the project , which he has dubbed 1000 + coffees , and his related blog			1
coffee # 4 : @entity19 ( friends on @entity3 since december 2013 , 71 mutual friends )			1
@entity6 ( left ) explains on his project 's blog , ' @entity24 and i met last year at @entity26			1
we were camping together thanks to mutual friends and i remember instantly hitting it off with him the moment we met			0
' coffee # 5 : @entity33 @entity32 ( friends on @entity3 since june 2008 , 145 mutual friends )			1
@entity6 said on his blog , ' @entity32 is one of my best friends and we hang out every week , but neither of us have any idea exactly how and when we met , but it was around the time i was living in a warehouse in @entity44 and having lots of parties			1
' coffee # 7 : @entity48 ( friends on @entity3 2.0 since november 2013 , 46 mutual friends )			1
' @entity50 and i caught up on our families , chatted about pop - culture and the time she rapped @entity58 ’s remix of ‘ @entity59 ' to a room of gobsmacked la - types , ' said @entity55 ' it ’s a very simple idea , really			0
i literally just asked myself , " who are these one thousand apparent friends i have ? " , who 'd i accumulated over about seven years , ' said @entity55 ' i was just going to do a cull to get rid of people , but then i thought that i should see if i could get to know them instead			2
it seemed like a cool social experiment , and amazingly has changed my life for the better			1
' starting the project in early september , @entity6 has had at least one coffee date per day for the past three weeks , and has already met up with 23 of his @entity3 - and now soon to be real - friends , with some interesting results			1
' i 've been keeping a very open mind			0
i caught up with an ex-girlfriend from five years ago , which went really well			0
we both have partners now , but we just slipped into old habits of chatting			0
i 'm assuming other people psych themselves out over their relationships with other people , but i 'm so glad that i have this catalyst to meet people , ' said @entity55 ' everyone i 've met up with has been interested in it			0
it 's a basic idea but has already had such a positive effect on my life			2
' coffee # 10 : @entity93 ( friends on @entity3 since may 2014 , no mutual friends )			1
@entity6 said on his blog , ' today i caught up with the lovely @entity96 , a new friend that i met at university towards the end of last semester			2
@entity96 and i both took a class on @entity100 and got chatting one day after she found out i was studying @entity102			0
' @entity6 said , ' coffee # 11 : @entity106 aka @entity105 ( friends on @entity3 since september 2007 , 84 mutual friends ) last night i strapped myself in for the experience of catching up with the hurricane of a human and old friend that i really need to make more time for , @entity112			1
' coffee # 14 : @entity113 ( friends on @entity3 since september 2011 , 53 mutual friends )			1
' @entity113 was in the year level above me in high school and also happens to be my sister ’s best friend ’s sister , so we had been friendly with each other for years			0
' said @entity6 on his project website			2
@entity6 sees the meet - ups as less of an opportunity to talk about himself , and much more a way to hear about other people 's lives			2
' i guess i see myself as more in an interviewing role , ' he said			0
' the experiment is a type of document about other people as well as the experience of stepping out of comfort zones			0
every person has something interesting and amazing to say			0
' ' i caught up with a friend from primary school who i have n't seen since 1998			0
he 's an amazing professional photographer and is going to take me diving			0
' ' i 've also had my taro read , which i 've never done before			0
really , this experience has just opened up a whole new universe of people that i would n't have been exposed to			0
' @entity6 has had a few snarky comments left on his blog , but he says that despite a little bit of tension , overwhelmingly the response has been supportive			2
' the theme of the project is for me , and others , to step out of the prescribed role of social media , and to spark something different			1
it seems that social media has evolved into everyone staring at their screens instead of interacting with those who are right in front of them , ' he said			1
' i used to work in hospitality and i was always so intrigued by the groups of people who would sit at the table staring at their phones without being in the moment			0
worse , they would put their phones on the table , waiting and ready for some fascinating development			0
' despite being a full - time student , @entity6 has been offered two jobs by people he has met up with during the project			1
he is now working several days a week as a digital strategist working on social media campaigns , and is also about to start working for the @entity178 , running workshops on having meaningful conversations			1
' both the jobs are pretty fitting to the whole theme of the experiment , ' @entity6 said			0
' i 've had to start getting up two to three hours early each day to fit the coffee dates in , but even though i 've got more on my plate now , i 'm determined to keep going			0
' ' the whole process has just changed my life so completely , and has had such a positive impact			2
' @entity6 said on the 1000 + @entity190 project : ' coffee # 17 : @entity192 ( friends on @entity3 since october 2007 , 14 mutual friends ) this afternoon i had the absolute pleasure of catching up with my old friend from primary school , @entity192 , someone i have n’t seen in thirteen years			1
' coffee # 20 : @entity198 ( friends on @entity3 since march 2011 , 36 mutual friends )			2
' @entity198 and i met through her excellent , self - proclaimed ‘ whorecore ’ band @entity200 in 2010			0
' said @entity6 on his blog coffee # 18 : @entity202 ( friends on @entity3 since november 2010 , 29 mutual friends ) ' @entity205 and i met back in 2010 at a bar she was working at in @entity207 that i used to occasionally @entity208 at			1
she would often give me extra beers in exchange for music requests ' said @entity6 on his blog			2

@entity6 has launched his blog project , 1000 + @entity190 , to get to know all of his @entity3 friends
launched in september , the @entity7 student is aiming to meet up with all 1088 in the next three years
said that it has ' changed his life in such a positive way '
wants the project to be a way of *challenging* the use of social media
