by @entity1 reporter last updated at 12:41 pm on 19th august 2011 executed : @entity2 was put to death via lethal injection at @entity5 in @entity6 a prisoner who raped and murdered an 88 - year - old widow has been executed despite a campaign to have his death sentence commuted			1
@entity11 , 30 , was sentenced to death for the 2001 rape and murder of seamstress @entity14 , 88 , in her apartment in the city of @entity17 , @entity6			0
he was pronounced dead at 9.14pm on thursday at @entity5 after his execution went ahead despite a campaign to save his life by lawyers and a reverend who spent years visiting him in jail			2
@entity2 was close to a reprieve last year when @entity26 district judge @entity25 allowed a two - day evidentiary hearing in which @entity2 's brother and sister testified about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his father and stepfather while growing up			1
@entity25 ordered that @entity2 should receive a new sentencing hearing , saying the testimony ' painted a graphic picture of an unwarranted , continuous , sadistic course of conduct that terrorized and dehumanized @entity2 throughout his childhood			1
' however , earlier this year a federal appeals court overturned that ruling on a technicality			0
recently , @entity2 's lawyers had argued that jurors should get a chance to hear the graphic details of @entity2 's horrific childhood abuse			1
but that argument was not enough to sway governor @entity49 , who denied a request to commute @entity2 's sentence to life in prison last week			1
on the day of the execution the @entity26 @entity54 denied a further request to block the execution			2
in a recent telephone interview , @entity2 talked about the abuse , which began with a broken arm when he was 19 months old and continued with sexual abuse and beatings with a fist , belt and once a two - by - four for more than a decade			1
execution chamber : the room at @entity67 where @entity2 was put to death using a controversial cocktail of drugs , which may cause suffering @entity2 acknowledged killing mrs @entity14			1
although he said it was n't an excuse for what he did , @entity2 said he did n't think it would have happened if he could have escaped the abuse as a child			1
' i do n't think i would have ended up this way , ' he said			2
' i do n't think i would be on death row			0
' @entity2 also expressed regret for his actions , saying : ' i 'm sorry mrs. @entity14 lost her life due to something that i done			1
' victim : @entity14 , 88 , was raped and murdered by @entity2 in her apartment in @entity17 in 2001 ' i 'm sorry to mr. @entity86 ( her son ) that he hurt so much			1
i 'm sorry that he lost his mother			0
' the @entity89 , who has written to and visited @entity2 for several years , called him a loyal and caring friend to many people			1
she was with @entity2 until he was taken into the death chamber			1
she then witnessed the execution , holding her bible , shutting her eyes and appearing to mouth a prayer			0
she had called up until the final hours for @entity2 's life to be spared			2
' he is not a monster , ' she said			0
' there is good in him as well as the bad that he 's done			0
' i wanted him to know there was somebody with him who loved him and who saw him as a beloved child of @entity107			0
and to know that in the midst of the state taking his life that there were people there that cared about him			0
' the execution also went ahead despite controversy over the method used			0
due to a shortage of a drug called sodium thiopental , many states have replaced it with pentobarbital , an epilepsy drug manufactured by @entity126 firm @entity125			0
@entity125 is on record as opposing the ' distressing misuse ' of its product and in a recent @entity132 execution there was some evidence the inmate suffered when the drug was used			2
worried : @entity136 had followed the controversy over the use of pentobarbital and had concerns about its use in his execution lawyers in several states have contested the use of pentobarbital , but federal courts have ruled that there is not enough significant evidence to prevent its use in two dozen executions this year			1
@entity2 had followed news reports about the use of pentobarbital , including the @entity132 case , and was said to be concerned about its use			2
when asked if he had any final words , @entity2 shook his head and said ' no '			2
while waiting for the cocktail of three drugs to be administered @entity2 tapped his foot as he lay strapped to a stainless steel gurney			1
the execution team took around 15 minutes to insert two intravenous lines , one in each of his arms			0
within four minutes of the lines being inserted , he was pronounced dead			0
@entity2 was the 31st person to be executed in the @entity26 this year			1
@entity167 spokesman @entity166 said the execution team had carried out the order of execution in a ' professional and constitutional manner			0
' the family of @entity14 , @entity2 's victim , did not witness the execution , though her son @entity174 - who found her dead in her apartment on august 26 , 2001 - said the execution was long overdue			1
mrs @entity14 , a widow for 30 years , had moved to @entity6 from @entity178 in the late 1990s so that she could be near her son and be safe			0
she worked as a seamstress making slip covers and draperies up until her death			0
during @entity2 's court case it was revealed that he had broken into her home while she was asleep			2
when awoke to find him rummaging through her purse and offered him anything he wanted if he would leave			0
instead , he put a pillow over her face and raped her			0
@entity2 fled the scene in mrs @entity193 ' car and used the $ 60 he stole from her apartment to buy marijuana			2
rev. @entity196 and @entity2 's lawyer declined to comment after the execution , the 32nd in the @entity26 this year .			1
