with @entity1 still nursing an striker crisis at the club , veteran defender @entity0 put forward a case to play in the makeshift role for the champions after a stunning goal in training			1
@entity0 produced something out of the ordinary ahead of his side 's @entity11 win against @entity13 wednesday on sunday , flicking the ball over team - mate @entity15 before hitting a rasping volley into the net , giving @entity18 no chance in the goal			1
the 34 - year - old , who has just three goals to his name since joining @entity1 in september 2013 , was an unused substitute as his side edged past the @entity26 opposition to advance to the fourth round of the competition			2
@entity0 holds off team - mate @entity15 as he looks to turn onto his right foot to have a shot the 34 - year - old makes the perfect connection with the ball in the training session ahead of the cup clash the defender and his team - mates watch on as the ball flies into the top corner @entity0 applauds himself after scoring the sensational goal in a training session with @entity1 's striking options still limited early on in the @entity43 , @entity0 could be considered for such a role in the near future , especially if their striking problems worsen			2
@entity47 and @entity48 remain on the sidelines , with fellow forward @entity50 only recently returning from an injury lay - off			0
in their absence utility man @entity52 played as a false no 9 for a three - game spell , with @entity57 's men winning two and drawing one of those fixtures during that time			0
@entity57 's men are currently level on points with @entity63 at the top of the @entity65 , with only alphabetical order separating the two sides currently .			0

@entity1 beat @entity13 wednesday 2 - 1 at the @entity69 on sunday to advance to the fourth round of the @entity11
prior to the match veteran defender @entity0 scored a stunning volley in training
the 34 - year - old 's rasping volley gave @entity18 no chance in the @entity1 goal
with this kind of *clinicial* streak the defender could come into contention to play in a forward role - with @entity52 recently playing in that position
city have been light on attacking options with the likes of @entity47 and @entity48 both currently sidelined through injury
