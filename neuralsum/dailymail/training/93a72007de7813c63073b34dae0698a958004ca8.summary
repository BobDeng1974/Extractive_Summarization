by @entity0 published : 10:10 est , 28 march 2012 updated : 07:20 est , 3 april 2012 as he explored his own back garden , a scrap of pottery protruding from the dirt caught dr @entity7 's eye			1
when the hospital worker tried to dig it out , it cracked open - spilling out a stream of gold and silver coins ' like a slot machine '			1
dr @entity7 , 53 , was inspecting a hole dug by builders at his home , in the village of @entity20 , near @entity21 , @entity22			1
token of love : the gold ring found among the hoard bears the romantic inscription ' when you see this , remember me ' the haul of @entity33 currency could be worth as much as £ 51,000 - but the doctor has had to hand it all in to the government			1
just under 600 coins dating from around the 1640s were found , as well as a stunning gold ring bearing the romantic inscription ' when this you see , remember me '			1
studies showed the find , with individual coins to the value of just over £ 85 , was located near what looked like an old post , and could have been stashed underground by a @entity49 who feared it would be looted by @entity52 troops			2
speaking outside @entity53 , where an treasure trove inquest ruled the find belongs to the state , dr @entity7 said he had taken the day off from @entity57 when he made the amazing discovery last july			1
dr @entity7 , who lives with wife @entity59 , 55 , and daughters @entity61 , 22 , @entity62 , 21 , and @entity63 , 17 , said : ' at first i thought the coins were some sort of toy , then we started having a closer look at them			1
the gold ones looked like they had just come out of a museum , and the ring is beautiful			1
' it was then we started to realise this was something significant			2
it was very exciting and we just stood there for a long time looking at it			2
' council bosses in @entity80 are now hoping they can secure the historic hoard for display at @entity83			1
dr @entity7 said : ' @entity83 is very interesting but it could do with some highlights and this would definitely be a highlight , which would be good because @entity21 ’s history is sometimes undervalued			1
' digging it : dr @entity7 , 53 , is pictured with his wife @entity59 and daughter @entity61 at the treasure inquest in @entity80			1
he will now have to wait to find out whether he is entitled to compensation for his discovery @entity93 , @entity94 ’s service director for sport and culture , added : ' we believe these items have been in our district since the 1600s , making them a real part of this district ’s rich history			2
' it would be a great shame to not do all we can to try and keep the treasure in its rightful home for future generations to enjoy			1
' the @entity80 district has a superb , nationally renowned heritage and @entity83 would be a fitting home for the treasure			2
' it would be yet another major attraction for visitors and contribute directly to the rich history of the area			2
it would also support the new @entity119 development			0
' the council will now wait for a valuation , after which it will be decided whether dr @entity7 will get any compensation			1
the hoard is more than 300 years old and so is covered by the @entity125 of 1996			2
overthrown : king @entity126 when @entity126 took the throne in 1625 , his reign was met with almost immediate murmurs of discontent			0
his was a style of governance defined by religious dogma and a stubborn opposition to parliamentary rule			0
this bred feelings of alienation and deep mistrust in pockets of @entity141 , while in @entity143 tensions with the @entity141 boiled over into bloody conflict			0
the embattled king was forced to form a parliament in 1640 , and within this a vocal and highly critical @entity148 faction began to grow			0
when a violent @entity152 rebellion broke out in @entity153 , disagreements over how to respond split @entity141 in two , and in 1642 the @entity33 broke out			0
the @entity154 , based largely in the north and west , fought for the king , while the @entity52 , also known as @entity158 , came mainly from the south and east			0
they took their nickname from their preference for closely cropped hair , which set them apart from the ringlets of courtly @entity154			0
the battles that followed saw @entity126 's forces , bolstered by the @entity168 and @entity169 , clash with a @entity52 army swollen with @entity171			0
the @entity154 looked to be on the brink of victory in 1643 , until their enemies joined forces with the @entity143			0
in 1644 , the king 's men suffered a crushing defeat at @entity178 , @entity179 , effectively conceding the north			0
a further loss at @entity182 , @entity183 , was the final nail in the coffin			0
the king gave himself up to the @entity143 and they promptly passed him on to their @entity52 allies , who were in the early stages of establishing a republican regime			0
he was executed in 1649 , but not before inciting further clashes known as the @entity192 .			0

dr @entity7 also found a gold ring bearing the inscription : ' when you see this , remember me '
