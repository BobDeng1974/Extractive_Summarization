the @entity1 and @entity2 rubbed shoulders with @entity5 royalty , @entity0 could n't keep his hands off @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 flirted up a storm while @entity11 and @entity12 chit - chatted with pals , flanked by prince @entity14 , lord @entity15 and his wife , actress @entity16			1
no , this is nâ€™t the glitzy after - party of a @entity5 premiere , but centre court at the @entity22 2014			0
has there ever been such a starry crowd in suburban @entity25 ? and how on earth has lawn tennis become such a fixture on the celebrity circuit ? june 30 : sir @entity30 arrives at @entity22 to cheer on @entity31 , who beat big - serving @entity33 @entity32 july 1 : a monochrome suit - clad @entity30 arrives to watch @entity35 take on @entity36 july 2 : third time 's a charm for sir @entity30 , who arrived to watch @entity31 play @entity40 in the quarterfinals july 3 : he 's back again - and this time he brought @entity44 along with him to watch @entity45 lose to @entity46 in the women 's quarter finals july 4 : sir @entity30 arrives during day twelve of the @entity49 to watch @entity51 play @entity40 in the men 's semi finals july 5 : here he is again for the women 's final where @entity46 lost to @entity56 july 6 : obviously sir @entity30 could n't miss the big men 's finals , where he watched @entity51 beat @entity35 from the @entity59 june 30 : sir @entity60 arrives at @entity22 to cheer on @entity31 , who beat big - serving @entity33 @entity32 july 4 : former tv journalist sir @entity60 arrives for the semi-finals on day 11 of the @entity22 july 5 : sir @entity60 arrives to watch the women 's singles finals , where @entity56 beat @entity46 july 6 and 2 : @entity64 of @entity65 was a real royal in the royal box on two occasions at this year 's tournament			1
left , watching @entity51 and @entity35 in the men 's finals and , right , watching @entity31 v @entity40 some stars are known to be avid fans - seven - time visitor @entity30 , @entity74 , @entity0 all have form - but a few admitted to never having watched a match before			1
the answer might lie in the energetic activities of championship sponsors @entity79 , whose public relations team has gone into overdrive persuading the stars to make the trip down to south @entity84			1
the @entity86 suite kept the important people supplied with free @entity88 's , table tennis , afternoon tea and @entity93 ( @entity92 's line of sweets , do n't you know )			2
celebrities who passed through its portals include @entity99 , @entity102 models @entity100 and new girlfriend @entity103 ( at the all - over - each - other stage , according to onlookers ) , @entity106 and @entity107 and @entity108 , to name but a few			0
tennis fans the @entity111 made their presence felt throughout the fortnight			0
whilst @entity114 once admitted she and her sister used to have to queue with the other mere mortals for tickets , this year they took their seats again in the royal box			1
@entity8 attended twice with her husband @entity120 while @entity114 also went twice , once with their brother @entity121 and then with her parents and boyfriend , @entity124			0
@entity125 and @entity14 trumped their off spring by attending three times			0
they were on centre court on three different days - with one of them spent in the royal box thanks to their connections to the throne			1
not lucky charms : prince @entity120 joined his wife on both of her visits			0
unfortunately on their first trip , they saw @entity31 lose in his quarter final match against @entity40 on july 2 genuine fans : the reactions of the @entity1 and @entity2 throughout the men 's final match showed how much they love the sport july 6 and june 26 : @entity8 's sister @entity146 also attended twice , with her brother @entity121 in week one , right , and her mother , @entity125 , and boyfriend @entity124 for the men 's final , left @entity146 hat - trick : @entity125 and @entity152 trumped their daughters by going to centre court on three different days , from left on june 27 , july 2 and for the men 's final yesterday june 30 : @entity158 star @entity157 attends the @entity160 v @entity46 match on centre court july 2 : he returned to see his friend @entity46 defeat @entity163 on court one in their quarter final match july 3 : back on centre court , he watched as @entity46 beat @entity45 to book her place in the final july 5 : in the women 's final , @entity46 's luck ran out and he watched as she lost the title to @entity56 support : comedian @entity176 joined @entity31 's coach @entity177 in the players ' box on centre court to watch him win his third round match against @entity182 , left			1
after the match , he met the @entity185 number one to help him through his warm down on exercise bikes @entity12 watched @entity189 win against @entity190 on june 24 and was ' thrilled ' to get a picture with the champion afterwards the @entity194 star returned to watch the men 's final even though @entity189 missed out on getting there meanwhile for others , befriending a top seed now seems to be the in - thing - comedian @entity176 joined @entity31 's support team this year even though the pair had previously never met			1
the @entity185 number one explained in his @entity205 blog : ' there was a new face in the gym after friday 's match as comedian @entity176 came along , as i 'd invited him to sit in my player box ... i 'd never met him before , although we 've had plenty of @entity215 banter and i 've watched all of his shows and his stand - up			1
' he added that big names taking an interest in tennis can only be good for the sport as it creates more interest			0
last year @entity31 's famous fans , who cheered him on alongside his family , included comedian @entity227 and cyclist sir @entity228			1
but he 's not the only one with well - known friends			2
women 's finalist @entity46 has a fan in the @entity158 star @entity157			0
he said they have been friends for years and he watched her play four times during this year 's tournament			2
two visits : @entity7 and boyfriend @entity0 attend the semi-final match between @entity51 and @entity40 on centre court on 4 july , left			2
he returned without her to watch the men 's final on july 6 between @entity51 and @entity35 , right joining in : @entity241 and his mother @entity242 carry on a @entity244 wave as they attend on saturday 28 june to watch victories from @entity189 , @entity35 and @entity92 free publicity : @entity241 was joined by his wife @entity248 on his second visit when she wore a dress from her new collection having fun ? she certainly did n't seem to be enjoying the match as much as her sporty husband too much excitement ? @entity257 watched as @entity51 took on @entity258 in week one , left , but he did n't seem quite as captivated during the men 's final , right this number of attendances was only beaten in the star stakes by the ever - present singer @entity30 - who attended seven times this year			1
former newsreader sir @entity60 , who is known to play tennis recreationally himself , was also there three times			2
there 's no doubt the standard of tennis at the moment would have been a draw for many			2
as if the old guard of @entity35 , @entity189 , @entity51 and last year 's champion @entity31 are n't enough of a world class sporting spectacle , this year they were challenged by a number of rising talents including @entity40 and @entity280			2
meanwhile , there were a number of stars in the women 's game to keep people entertained including eventual champion @entity56			0
time for tennis ? @entity288 and @entity106 , left , and @entity99 , right , enjoy the hospitality at the @entity86 suite on the opening day of @entity22 funny men do @entity22 : @entity293 and @entity294 pose with with @entity295 in the @entity296 making the most of the summertime tipple : @entity299 and @entity295 enjoy the free @entity88 in the @entity296 all white ! @entity5 actress @entity8 added some glamour to the @entity302 yesterday as she watched the men 's final while once was enough for the @entity305 and @entity306 , for other a-listers , much more than a single visit was needed			1
@entity309 reveals which big names love @entity22 the most ... @entity30 - @entity311 ( @entity158 ) - @entity312 and @entity313 and @entity2 - @entity319 - @entity318 - @entity317 - @entity316 - @entity315 prince @entity314 and princess @entity322 - @entity321 - two but it seems some of the celebrities were n't just there to see the tennis but to be seen at the tennis			1
this certainly seemed to be the case for @entity248 who did n't join her sporting husband when he attended the first saturday of the tournament - so he took his mother instead			1
but perhaps certain that more of the world would be watching on men 's final day , she joined her husband in the royal box on that occasion , and made the most of it by showcasing a dress from her new collection			1
despite not cracking a smile throughout the whole day , she later tweeted that she had ' so much fun '			0
she then posted a picture of her outfit pointing out it was part of her spring / summer 15 range			0
for some of the stars , the hospitality might also have been more of a draw than the sport			0
singers @entity106 and @entity99 were among the stars pictured enjoying themselves being entertained in @entity79 's @entity22 suite			2
they were able to grab food and drink , try their hand at table tennis - and of course be pictured by the gathered photographers			0
@entity363 , evian senior brand manager said they were delighted with how many celebs they had through their doors : ' we have been really pleased with how popular the evian live young suite has been this year , we 've had more a list celebrities than ever			0
' this is the eighth year we have been encouraging the stars to have fun and play at @entity49 , @entity22 and they have obviously enjoyed themselves			0
we are already looking forward to next year ! '			0
