@entity0 made a point of shaking hands with every one of the medical workers gathered for a @entity5 photo - op today as he hailed the work of @entity9 - exposed health care professionals			1
the president thanked the ' hero ' doctors and nurses for their work in @entity15 and insisted that they must be treated with dignity and respect			2
he conceded , though , that @entity18 will ' likely see more cases ' of the disease , which kills more than half of those diagnosed			2
a series of controversies have erupted , most visibly in @entity25 , surrounding the difficult question of whether @entity18 who work with @entity9 patients overseas should be forcibly quarantined upon their return			1
@entity0 said he was ' a little frustrated ' by ' people talking about @entity18 leadership ' but then ' running in the opposite direction and hiding under the covers ' when @entity9 emerges - an apparent dig at @entity25 's governor @entity34			1
quarantines for @entity9 typically last 21 days , the length of the disease 's incubation period			2
some of @entity0 's guests were still within that time - frame , meaning that they could possibly be harboring the virus without yet showing any outward symptoms			1
@entity9 can be spread through contact with bodily fluids , including sweat			2
human hands are the body parts that sweat the most			2
@entity0 said @entity18 ' ca n't hermetically seal ourselves off ' from the world in the fight against @entity9			1
discouraging their work with restrictive measures that confine them upon their return , he added , would be a bad policy			0
' we will contain and eventually snuff out this outbreak , ' the president pledged			0
' we do n't run and hide when there is a problem			1
' he did n't name any particular states , governors or policies , but his point was understood as a jab at @entity25 gov. @entity34 , whose statewide quarantine mandate goes far beyond what the @entity84 considers necessary			1
the @entity25 leader has been at the center of a row over the treatment of @entity90 , who was put into quarantine after arriving at @entity92 and who claimed she was being mistreated by being detained			2
@entity0 also embraced @entity94 , a @entity18 doctor who was treated for @entity9 but has since been declared free of the viral infection			1
his remarks came in the @entity97 of the @entity5			1
some of the health care workers have already been in @entity99 , @entity100 or @entity101 , where the disease has killed more than 5,000			0
others will soon go there			0
the president paid tribute to the health care workers ' on the front line in @entity15 '			0
' we need to call them what they are , ' he said : ' @entity18 heroes ' who show ' what is possible when @entity18 leads '			0
@entity0 cited an improvement in the mood of ebola - stricken countries as an example of ' @entity18 exceptionalism '			1
moments later he complained about policies that might make health care workers reconsider braving the inconveniences associated with traveling to fight @entity9			0
the president said @entity18 ' ca n't hermetically seal ourselves off ' from the world in the fight against @entity9 found ! @entity5 ebola response coordinator @entity130 , a former chief of staff to two vice presidents whose lack of a medical background has made him a political punching bag , attended the photo - op ' we are at our best when we are standing up and taking responsibility , ' @entity0 said			1
' making sacrifices especially when it requires sacrifices			0
' ' that 's how we help others around the world ... it 's not just massive deployments of troops and equipment			0
as proud as we are of that , it 's also our skill and compassion and painstaking effort and our ability to learn from mistakes that are made , and our ability to work through problems that are complicated			0
' ' and to see something through			0
and not lose our heads			0
to have grace under pressure			0
and apply ourselves with slow , steady effort			0
the kind that change and progress requires			0
that 's what i want to see from us , the pride of a nation that steps up to get the job done			0
' ' ebola czar ' @entity130 , the @entity169 operative tapped to coordinate what the @entity5 calls a ' whole of government response ' to the @entity9 crisis , was in attendance on wednesday but said nothing publicly			1
@entity130 's absence from public view has led to charges that the @entity5 is n't as serious about combating the public health threat as it is about managing the political risks just days before an election			1
@entity183 pundits have joked about the ' where 's @entity186 ' - style parlor game involved with spotting the all - but - invisible @entity130			1
the @entity5 says he spoke with the president on six of his first seven days on the job			1
nurse @entity190 ( left ) , who was quarantined at @entity92 this weekend when she returned from @entity15 , on the orders of @entity34 ( right ) to detain anyone potentially exposed to @entity9 the nurse was released from @entity194 ( above ) on monday after threatening to sue over her being kept in it			1
but @entity196 said she had ' takeout food from the best restaurants in @entity25 nurse @entity190 is now at her home in @entity200 , where she continues to protest over previous treatment and is now at odds with the governor of that state over whether she can leave the house @entity206 @entity34 to nurse @entity207 : ' whatever , @entity208			1
' @entity25 gov. @entity34 blew off on tuesday claims by a nurse that she was treated inhumanely when she was under mandatory quarantine over the weekend for @entity9			1
speculating about the possibility of a lawsuit from the nurse , @entity190 , @entity34 said , ' whatever			1
i 've been sued lots of times before			0
i 'm happy to take it on , ' he added , according to @entity221			0
@entity34 disputed the nurse 's claims that she was mistreated and pointed out that the tent she was confined to was indoors , not outdoors , as early reports claimed			1
' there 's been all kinds of malarkey ... about this , ' @entity34 told reporters who trailed while on a campaign stop in @entity233			2
' she was inside the hospital in a climate - controlled area with access to her cell phone , access to the internet , and takeout food from the best restaurants in @entity92 , ' he said			0
@entity34 has been heavily scrutinized over his decision to keep @entity190 in quarantine for several days after she tested negative for @entity9			1
attorney @entity245 speaks to his client , quarantined nurse @entity190 , at the isolation tent at @entity249 in @entity92 , @entity25 , where @entity190 was confined after flying into @entity92 abrupt : @entity34 had a brief and pointed response when he was asked about the potential for @entity253 to sue : ' whatever			1
' he added that she had been well - treated and disputed her claim she was in a hospital car park the nurse came from @entity15 by way of a @entity25 airport last week			2
she found herself summarily quarantined by state health officials after they detected she had a slight fever - a common symptom of @entity9			0
but even after the nurse 's fever subsided , health officials kept her confined to a tent at a local hospital that had no shower or flushable toilet			0
she has obtained a high - powered civil rights lawyer to defend her in a potential lawsuit			0
the lawyer , @entity274 , told @entity275 on sunday that @entity190 's quarantine raised ' serious constitutional and civil liberties issues			1
' the @entity25 government has since allowed @entity190 to return to her home in @entity200			2
@entity34 , a possible , 2016 presidential candidate , has denied that her release was an about - face , however			2
he has also refused to rescind the state 's new policy requiring health workers returning from @entity15 to self - quarantine at home for 21 days , the incubation period for @entity9			2
on tuesday he maintained that he did n't think he 'd done anything wrong in keeping her isolated until health officials could be sure she did n't have @entity9			0
' we 're trying to be careful here , ' @entity34 said on @entity296 's today show			2
' this is common sense , and ... the @entity18 public believes it is common sense			2
and we 're not moving an inch			0
our policy has n't changed , and our policy will not change			0
' at the campaign event later that day @entity34 pointed out that the @entity306 staff who were ' on the ground in @entity249 monitoring the conditions she was in ' did n't think the state treated @entity190 unfairly , either			1
' she had access to the @entity313 and we brought her takeout food , ' he said			0
pouncing on @entity34 's comment , @entity315 called some of @entity92 's ' finest ' takeout restaurants and found that none of them delivered food to @entity190 - or at least not to the restaurants ' knowledge			1
as @entity34 noted @entity25 officials brought @entity190 the food , so takeout restaurants may not have been aware they were feeding the @entity9 patient .			1

doctors and nurses , including some who could be incubating the disease , *appeared* in @entity97 photo - op with the president
president shook hands with everyone on stage during @entity5 reception about disease that can be spread through sweat
' we do n't run and hide when there is a problem ... *â€Ž* ' we ca n't hermetically seal ourselves off '
@entity0 ' a little frustrated ' by ' people talking about @entity18 leadership ' but then ' running in the opposite direction and hiding under the covers '
seen as dig at @entity34 over nurse @entity190 's quarantine but @entity25 gov is *defiant* over handling of case
@entity130 , the @entity5 ' ebola czar , ' was in attendance but continued his streak of days on the job without making public comment
