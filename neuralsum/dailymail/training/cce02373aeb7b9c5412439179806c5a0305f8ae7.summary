the gestation period for the species is between 14 and 16 months , after which they give birth standing up in order to break the umbilical chord			2
the breeding pair did produce one other calf , a male , which was born in august last year but died shortly afterwards			1
the zoo ’s other female is @entity38 , who came from @entity39 in the @entity40			0

there are only 670 @entity50 's giraffes in the wild , making them rarer than @entity66 very little is known about why the @entity4 - named after lord @entity50 - is so endangered			1
poaching , loss of habitat and increased contact with humans have all been put forward as theories to explain their gradual disappearance			0
giraffe are relatively easy to kill as they will often stare intently at a target before running , aming them easy to shoot			2
their long legs are also easily tangled in traps and one fall can be enough to break their necks			0
for the amount of effort required to kill , they have a large amount of meat and could therefore be targets for bush meat poachers			0
their skins are also prized for use on clothing , their mane can be woven into bracelets , their tails are used to convey authority and their leg tendons can be used as guitar strings			0
like most endangered species their body parts are also commonly used in tribal medicine			2
there are as few as 670 left in the wild , making them rarer than @entity66 , with another 450 believed to be in captivity .			0
