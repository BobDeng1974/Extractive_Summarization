a scientist has suggested the search for @entity2 should be extended thousands of miles north to a @entity5 valley where a cloud of smoke was seen at about the time the plane could have crashed			1
space scientist and physicist @entity9 , who is based in @entity11 , @entity12 , admitted that the search for the missing plane in the @entity15 appeared to be in the wrong place			1
suggesting that the @entity18 jet with 239 passengers and crew on board most likely ended up much further south , he also turned his attention to a valley in the central @entity25 country of @entity5			2
' for example , someone should go and take a look at the suggested crash site in the @entity30 - @entity29 ( @entity5 ) which was indicated by a smoke plume just when the aircraft would have been expected to have crashed , ' he said			1
' in reality , that might be only a one - in - 1,000 possibility , but why not go and take a look so as to exclude it ? ' @entity51 - @entity50 mr @entity9 , who is a visiting professor of astrobiology at the @entity53 , said his own conclusions matched what has now been established by the authorities - that the sonic pings in the @entity15 were not from the @entity2 emergency locator beacon			1
based on available information from the released raw data , he said , it was most likely that the aircraft headed south at near 500 knots and ended up much further south than the current search area			1
he praised @entity51 satellite telecommunications company @entity65 for doing a good job of pulling out the data and analysing it , noting that the company 's analysis of its satellite data was good			0
' however , that does not mean i am sure they are correct because we have not been given vital information about the composition of the @entity78 ( @entity79 ) and the modelling that @entity65 performed			0
' if we had that information , we could check on what was done to verify it or possibly find errors , ' he said			0
mr @entity9 told @entity87 : ‘ i have great misgivings about the present and recent search regions in the @entity15			2
whilst it seems very likely that the aircraft did go south into the @entity15 , as in all scientific analyses various assumptions need to be made			2
‘ it may well be that the @entity65 engineers were correct in their deduction that it went south			2
but true scientists are always sceptical , and so we keep beavering away until such time as we convince ourselves that what has been stated is true			0
’ he told @entity87 that @entity100 professor dr @entity99 had looked at the last definite arc of possible locations of the aircraft , and considered possible crash locations in remote places			0
the expert then found satellite imagery which showed an apparent smoke plume in the @entity30 - @entity29 near @entity109 in @entity5 , a remote location at a relatively high , snow - covered altitude			1
dr @entity99 then discovered other satellite imagery obtained just a few hours later showed no smoke plume , which would appear to be consistent with a possible aircraft crash			0
meanwhile former @entity116 chief pilot captain @entity115 said he had no reason to disbelief the analysis and calculations by @entity65 and the @entity120			0
space scientist @entity9 said the search for @entity2 appeared to be in the wrong place			1
pictured are @entity116 passenger jets are shown parked on the tarmac at the @entity126 in march 2014 the @entity127 departed the previous search area in the @entity15 on friday after it was revealed that the acoustic ' pings ' whose data the search was based off were unlikely to have been coming from the plane 's black - box			1
the new search for the aircraft is anticipated to begin in august and take up to one year a @entity100 survey ship has already begun mapping of the new ocean floor , expected to continue for the next three months he said the calculations had been verified by experts familiar with the fields of satellite communications from a technical angle			2
however , he added that there are margins of error caused by utilisation of assumptions , which may result in the widening of the search area			1
in @entity158 , @entity153 , the president of the @entity156 airline , @entity157 , told the annual meeting of the @entity160 that more analysis was needed to find the missing jet			0
' we need to know more about what actually happened to this aeroplane and do a forensic analysis of it			0
i think we will find it and get to the bottom of it			0

@entity12 - based scientist @entity9 : search should include @entity30 - @entity29
plane ' most likely ended up much further south than current search area '
but he said consideration should be given to possible ' northern ' flight path
