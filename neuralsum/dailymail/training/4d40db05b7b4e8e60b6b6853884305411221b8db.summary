by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor ministers today revealed they had refused to sack the head of the @entity4 - despite revelations thousands of graduates had been sent @entity8 style letters from fake law firms demanding money			1
@entity4 chairman @entity11 apologised to ministers and offered to resign over the ' misleading ' letters sent out by the agency in an attempt to recover debts			1
the ' clear and unequivocal ' apology came in a meeting with business secretary @entity19 last week , but mr @entity11 's resignation was not accepted			1
business secretary @entity19 ( right ) turned down @entity4 chief @entity11 's resignation , the universities minister @entity23 ( left ) revealed today @entity8 was forced to hand out around £ 2.6million to customers in compensation for sending fake debt collection letters the government agency sent out letters under the name of @entity31 and @entity32 - a firm it set up - demanding repayment for graduates that were in arrears			1
but in a @entity40 statement today , the universities minister @entity23 said ministers believed mr @entity11 had a ' very important ' job to do at the @entity4 - and claimed it would be unfair for him to take the blame for a practice that was nearly 10 years old			1
more than 300,000 graduates received letters from @entity31 and @entity4 over a 10 - year period , it has emerged			2
the system was stopped on june 27 , following the @entity52 's public condemnation of payday lender @entity8 for similar ' aggressive and misleading practices '			2
like the @entity4 , @entity8 sent letters to thousands of its customers from non-existent law firms threatening them with legal action			1
the firm - which is the @entity60 ’s biggest lender - agreed to pay £ 2.6million in compensation to customers for making up the law firms to pressure debtors into paying up			2
it sent bogus letters from made up law firms ‘ @entity72 ’ and @entity69 ’ to mislead customers into believing their outstanding debt had been passed to lawyers			0
despite condemnation from mps over @entity8 's behaviour at the time , government minister mr @entity23 today backed the @entity4			1
in a @entity40 statement he said : ' @entity11 , the chairman of the @entity4 made a clear and unequivocal apology on behalf of the company in a discussion with the secretary of state on thursday july 3			1
i also spoke to mr @entity11 on thursday to investigate what had happened			0
' mr @entity11 tendered his resignation as chairman to the secretary of state but this was not accepted			1
the secretary of state and i have confidence in his leadership of the @entity4			2
the multi-millionaire founder of @entity8 , @entity92 ( pictured ) , has been criticised over his former company 's decision to send bogus legal letters to thousands of customers ' we see mr @entity11 having a very important job to do at the @entity4 to oversee the significant investment the @entity100 ( @entity100 ) is making in the company to enable it to transform its products and operations and overall levels of customer service			1
' we are both clear that it would be unfair for mr @entity11 to take the blame for a practice that was nearly 10 years old , particularly as he had only been chairman since he joined in february of this year			0
' the @entity4 has been issuing letters to graduates who fall into arrears on their repayments under the name of @entity31 and @entity4 since 2005 , mr @entity23 said			0
in total , about 309,000 people received letters , which were sent to individuals who had failed to respond to several contact attempts by the @entity4			0
the practice , which was seen as a ' low - cost alternative ' to referring these graduates to debt collection agencies , was approved in late 2004 by the @entity4 's board at the time and ministers under the @entity126 government , mr @entity23 said			0
he insisted that the approach was not known to him or mr @entity19 before recent media coverage of the issue			0
while the @entity4 had not broken any rules or charged graduates for receiving the letters , mr @entity23 said , he added that ' it was clear that a public body should be holding itself to the highest standards in the treatment of its customers '			0
he said : ' it is important that the government recover taxpayers ' money , but it must do so in a way which is fair			0
' it must not use misleading tactics to get people to do the right thing			0
the @entity4 has apologised and now stopped issuing letters under the @entity31 trading name			2
i will be working with the company to ensure that lessons are learnt to ensure there is no repeat in future			0
