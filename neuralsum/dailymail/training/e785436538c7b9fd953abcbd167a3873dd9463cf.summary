misfit : @entity16 are ready to cut their losses on striker @entity1 @entity31 was caught on camera less than two weeks in a private conversation with the boss of a @entity39 watch company complaining that his team did not have a striker as it challenged for the @entity43 title			2
@entity10 's @entity9 , @entity12 's @entity11 and @entity14 's @entity13 are among his targets but @entity16 must recoup much of their spending to keep within @entity18 's @entity15 restrictions			1
@entity1 is one who will command a decent fee , even if his value has plummeted during three inconsistent years at @entity49			0

talks : @entity0 were in for @entity60 before midfielder joined @entity6 ambitious : @entity0 boss @entity53 has already landed @entity6 defender @entity2 on his way : @entity2 will join @entity0 after his contract runs out at @entity6 the 32 - year - old 's contract that will be portrayed as being for two years , with an option for a third , but is effectively for three seasons			1
