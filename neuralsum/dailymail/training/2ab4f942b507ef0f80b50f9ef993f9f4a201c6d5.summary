in truth , @entity21 's side can consider themselves incredibly unlucky to finish the game without a point			0
as if @entity2 needed another ego boost , @entity6 captain @entity45 tried to get one over on his team - mates by asking for his shirt during the pre-match handshake ! much like in their opening game , @entity2 and @entity4 really struggled to get going in the first half against @entity6			1
@entity53 made two changes from the team that started that game , switching to the personnel and system that began the second half against @entity61 - the 4 - 3 - 3 shape that @entity2 himself had told his coach he prefers			0
ready and waiting : @entity2 in the tunnel ready to enter the fray greetings : shaking hands with @entity6 's @entity69 chancer : @entity6 captain @entity45 tries to lay dibs on @entity2 's shirt before kick off tripling up : the @entity74 team starved the forward for space from the first minute but with a sea of hardworking @entity74 between him and the goal , the @entity78 captain struggled to sparkle in the early stages , with two or three red shirts immediately on top of him the moment the ball came into his feet			1
the likes of @entity88 and @entity24 tried valiantly to stretch the game and create space for him , but @entity6 stood well - organised and firm			0
it took until the hour mark for @entity2 to find any space whatsoever , turning and charging towards goal from 40 yards out in a style familiar to that of his strike against @entity61 , but this time his shot from the edge of the area flew wide of the left - hand post			0
frustration : it was a difficult first half for the little @entity78 opportunity : @entity2 's best chance in the first half , a free kick , flew over left behind : @entity2 finally finds some space on the hour , but can not take advantage after firing wide his second chance to break the deadlock came from a free - kick on the edge of the area just over 10 minutes later , but @entity2 's curling strike could only find the side netting			2
and just as it looked as though it was going to finish goalless , it was @entity2 who provided the breakthrough , curling in a stunning 25 - yard effort to hand @entity4 a dramatic victory			1
it was @entity2 's second goal of the tournament and ensured his side 's passage through to the last 16 of the tournament			2
just inside : the ball found its way just inside the post impact : it was not @entity2 's best game overall , but that 's unlikely to matter embrace : captain and his team - mates celebrating after the final whistle			0
