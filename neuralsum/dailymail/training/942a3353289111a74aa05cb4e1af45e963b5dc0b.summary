by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 11:31 pm on 29th november 2011 intimate details of the affair between a married mp and his blonde @entity6 researcher were exposed last night as she was cleared of spying for @entity8			1
in her diary , @entity9 , then 20 , described her love for ' her darling @entity14 ' @entity13 , who is 40 years her senior			1
she wrote of her desire to feel him ' with all my naked body ' , and nicknamed the @entity19 her ' @entity20 ' , thought to be a reference to the ape from @entity24 's @entity23			2
success : miss @entity9 , 26 , smiles with flowers outside the @entity28 hearing today where she won her case against deportation details from the diary proved crucial in convincing the tribunal that she was not a honeytrap sent to access defence secrets while working in the @entity37 mp 's parliamentary office , as @entity38 claimed			1
the @entity39 described the diary as ' compelling ' evidence of her innocence and concluded the pair 's four - year liaison was ' enduring and genuine on both sides '			1
the panel said : ' however odd it might seem , she fell for him			0
' appeal : @entity50 told a hearing her affair with mp @entity13 was based on love , not espionage last night miss @entity9 admitted she was ' surprised ' to win her case and accused the security services of being ' unprofessional and paranoid '			1
she added : ' i went through an extremely unfair process			0
if i can describe it in war terms it would be me on a horse with a sword against tanks and aircraft			0
' and she confessed she felt she had no choice but to reveal intimate details of her private life to prove she was n't a spy			1
she said : ' i had two options			0
i would be forever branded a spy , but will be able to keep my private life private ; or i had to give all of this out to the press and to the public but be able to prove that i am not spy			2
' and for me , it was more important to prove that i am not a spy			2
' the former international relations student was arrested last year as the government sought to deport her to @entity6 , claiming her presence was a threat to national security			1
the 26 - year - old , known as @entity85 , was accused of seducing mr @entity13 , who has been married to his wife @entity86 for more than 40 years			1
government lawyers pointed to a string of affairs she had with older men in sensitive positions , including a @entity94 official and a @entity96 diplomat			0
the journal emerged at the start of the tribunal – despite miss @entity9 's claim in her first witness statement that she had never kept a diary			2
it purported to cover a period from november 2004 to april 2007 , including the start of the affair with mr @entity13 in 2006			1
she wrote of clashes with her sister @entity108 who told her she was ' wasting her youth on an older man '			0
the panel said the diary showed miss @entity9 to be an ' immature , calculating , emotional and self - centred young woman '			2
in it she describes four men she wishes to date as potential ' victims '			0
in april 2006 , she wrote : ' @entity13 , mp wants both to help me and to sleep with me			1
true love : miss @entity9 , 26 , wrote in her diary like a ' love - struck teenager ' after meeting 65 - year - old @entity123 mp @entity13 , right , at a conference in @entity125 in 2006 , the hearing heard ' he offered me to go with him to @entity127 at the end of june			1
is there any danger in it ? ' then in june , after the affair began , she wrote : ' i am in love ... and he 's gone to @entity136 today			1
' i worry a lot , do n't know what to do , what to do with myself			2
yes , he had told me that most probably he wo n't be able to either call or to write me			0
' i wish there were at least some news			0
i stay at home all day			0
what if he calls me ? my darling @entity14			0
happy : @entity50 , centre , walks with lawyers to her immigration hearing in @entity150 last month ' i so want to see you , to feel you with all my naked body			0
let the moment of our next meeting come the soonest possible			0
i love you , my @entity20 ! ' the tribunal said the entry about @entity136 was a ' revealingly false statement '			0
while miss @entity9 thought mr @entity13 was in @entity136 on a committee visit , he was actually in @entity161			2
the panel , chaired by mr @entity163 , accepted this could be a ' subsequent fabrication ' but concluded mr @entity13 had lied to her			2
their ruling states : ' the picture painted by the diary entries is inconsistent with the @entity38 's assessment that she was , most likely , tasked actively to pursue the offer of a relationship with mr @entity13			1
' the most likely explanation , and one which we find to be proved on the balance of probabilities , is that , however odd it might seem , she fell for him			0
' last night security officials insisted they were not in any way ' embarrassed ' by the ruling and insisted their identification of miss @entity9 as a potential threat to national security was correct			0
the ruling said : ' we are satisfied that it is significantly more likely than not that she was and is not a @entity6 agent			1
' however , it added : ' we can not exclude the possibility that we have been gulled – but , if we have been , it has been by a supremely competent and rigorously trained operative			0
' a @entity192 spokesman said : ' the court ruled that there were ample grounds for suspicion			1
we are therefore very disappointed by the court 's judgment			1

@entity6 blonde convinces court she was n't sending spy secrets to @entity202
she wins right to stay in the @entity205 after four - year affair with @entity13 , 65
@entity6 's lawyer hails ' *historic* judgment '
@entity192 ' disappointed ' by ruling
