by @entity0 scientists have identified 101 distinct geysers erupting on @entity5 ’s icy moon @entity3			1
their analysis suggests it is possible for liquid water to reach from the moon ’s underground sea all the way to its surface			1
they used mission data from @entity17 ’s @entity16 spacecraft taken over seven years to map each geyser eruption			1
this two - image mosaic is one of the highest resolution views acquired by @entity16 during its imaging survey of the geyser basin capping the southern hemisphere of @entity5 's moon @entity3			1
it clearly shows the curvilinear arrangement of geysers , erupting from the fractures			0
. from left to right , the fractures are @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , and @entity34			0
this graphic shows a 3 - d model of 98 geysers whose source locations and tilts were found in a @entity16 imaging survey of @entity3 ' south polar terrain			1
over a period of almost seven years , @entity16 ’s cameras surveyed the south polar terrain of the small moon , a unique geological basin renowned for its four prominent ' tiger stripe ' fractures and the geysers of tiny icy particles and water vapor first sighted there nearly 10 years ago			1
to determine the surface locations of the geysers , researchers employed the same process of triangulation used historically to survey geological features on @entity60 , such as mountains			2
when the researchers compared the geysers ’ locations with low - resolution maps of thermal emission , it became apparent the greatest geyser activity coincided with the greatest thermal radiation			2
the result of the survey is a map of 101 geysers , each erupting from one of the tiger stripe fractures , and the discovery that individual geysers are coincident with small hot spots			0
these findings , and clues to what powers the geyser eruptions , are presented in two articles published in the current online edition of the @entity86			0

these relationships pointed the way to the geysers ’ origin			0
after the first sighting of the geysers in 2005 , scientists suspected repeated flexing of @entity3 by @entity5 ’s tides as the moon orbits the planet had something to do with their behavior			2
one suggestion included the back - and - forth rubbing of opposing walls of the fractures generating frictional heat that turned ice into geyser - forming vapor and liquid			2
alternate views held that the opening and closing of the fractures allowed water vapor from below to reach the surface			1
a regional cross-section of the ice shell underlying @entity3 ' south polar terrain , illustrating our current knowledge of the physical and thermal structure and processes ongoing below and at the surface			0
before this new study , it was not clear which process was the dominating influence			0
nor was it certain whether excess heat emitted by @entity3 was everywhere correlated with geyser activity			0
to determine the surface locations of the geysers , researchers employed the same process of triangulation used historically to survey geological features on @entity60 , such as mountains			0
when the researchers compared the geysers ’ locations with low - resolution maps of thermal emission , it became apparent the greatest geyser activity coincided with the greatest thermal radiation			0
this artist 's rendering shows a cross-section of the ice shell immediately beneath one of @entity3 ' geyser - active fractures , illustrating the physical and thermal structure and the processes ongoing below and at the surface comparisons between the geysers and tidal stresses revealed similar connections			2
however , these correlations alone were insufficient to answer the question , “ what produces what ? ” the answer to this mystery came from comparison of the survey results with high - resolution data collected in 2010 by @entity16 ’s heat - sensing instruments			1
individual geysers were found to coincide with small - scale hot spots , only a few dozen feet ( or tens of meters ) across , which were too small to be produced by frictional heating , but the right size to be the result of condensation of vapor on the near - surface walls of the fractures			0
this @entity16 narrow - angle camera image -- one of those acquired in the survey conducted by the @entity16 imaging science team of the geyser basin at the south pole of @entity3 -- was taken as @entity16 was looking across the moon 's south pole this immediately implicated the hot spots as the signature of the geysering process			1
' once we had these results in hand we knew right away heat was not causing the geysers , but vice versa , ' said @entity207 , leader of the @entity16 imaging team from the @entity210 in @entity211 , @entity212 , and lead author of the first paper			2
' it also told us the geysers are not a near - surface phenomenon , but have much deeper roots			0
' thanks to recent analysis of @entity16 gravity data , the researchers concluded the only plausible source of the material forming the geysers is the sea now known to exist beneath the ice shell			1
they also found that narrow pathways through the ice shell can remain open from the sea all the way to the surface , if filled with liquid water			1
this dramatic view looks across the region of @entity3 ' geyser basin and down on the ends of the @entity33 and @entity34 fractures that face @entity5			0
in the companion paper , the authors report the brightness of the plume formed by all the geysers , as seen with @entity16 ’s high resolution cameras , changes periodically as @entity3 orbits @entity5			1
armed with the conclusion the opening and closing of the fractures modulates the venting , the authors compared the observations with the expected venting schedule due to tides			0
they found the simplest model of tidal flexing provides a good match for the brightness variations @entity16 observes , but it does not predict the time when the plume begins to brighten			2
on this polar stereographic map of @entity3 ' south polar terrain , all 100 geysers have been plotted whose source locations have been determined in @entity16 's imaging survey of the moon 's geyser basin .			1
