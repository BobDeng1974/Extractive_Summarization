drought caused by climate change may pushed @entity2 towards the devastating civil war currently riping the country apart , according to researchers			1
a new study has found that many parts of the country were hit by a record dry period between 2006 and 2010 which may have propelled the uprising against the @entity2 regime in 2011			1
the drought , which scientists say was likely made worse by climate change , destroyed much of the agriculture in the north of the country , driving farmers into cities			1
this image taken in @entity2 in 2009 shows how drought left farmers unable to grow crops on the parched land the resulting rising urban populations combined with poverty , government mismanagement and other factors combined to trigger the unrest that led to the civil war			1
the conflict hjas since escalated into a complex war involving extremist @entity36 groups including @entity37 and forces from other nations including the @entity40			0
the brutal civil war in @entity2 has left a trail of destruction so deep on the landscape that it can be seen from space			1
researchers at the @entity47 analyzed high - resolution satellite images of @entity49 taken from august 2012 to may 2013			2
they noticed a dramatic increase in the damage to buildings and infrastructure over the 10 - month period , with almost all of the destruction concentrated in rebel - controlled or contested areas			2
they also found that the historic 13th century walled ancient city of @entity49 - a @entity60 - has also suffered extensive damage from the war			2
satellite images have also shown how the proliferation of roadblocks and build up of artillery and tanks have increased			0
in separate satellite images released by @entity70 in 2012 , there were more than 600 craters caused by artillery fire in the small town of @entity74 , four miles from second city @entity49			0
an estimated 200,000 people have now been killed and an estimated nine million @entity2 have fled their homes since the outbreak of the war			1
dr @entity79 , a climate scientist at the @entity81 at @entity82 in @entity83 , said : ' we 're not saying the drought caused the war			1
' we â€™re saying that added to all the other stressors , it helped kick things over the threshold into open conflict			0
' a drought of that severity was made much more likely by the ongoing human - driven drying of that region			1
' the study , published in the journal @entity98 , said that the 2006 - 2010 drought was the worst and longest on record compared to those in the 1950s , 1980s and 1990s			1
particularly hard hit was the @entity102 that spans @entity2 , @entity103 and @entity104			0
since 1900 the area has undergone warming of between 1 degree @entity107 and 1.2 degrees @entity108 and rainfall in the wet season has fallen by 10 per cent			2
the researchers said the trend matched that predicted by models of climate change caused by human carbon dioxide emissions			0
they said that the wind patterns bringing rain from the @entity118 weakened while higher temperatures caused greater evaporation of moisture from the soils during the summer			0
the drought was so severe that the @entity124 in the city of @entity126 , eastern @entity2 receded to the point shown above in 2010			2
previous water levels can be seen clearly on the observation tower			0
nearly half a million people left this area during the drought and 85 per cent of livestock were killed by the lack of water rising city populations and increasing poverty due to the drought led to the 2011 uprising which swelling into outright conflict which is now devastating much of the country like @entity49 's @entity143 neighbourhood above this caused agricultural production to plunge by a third in @entity2			1
combined with a growing population - from four million in the 1950s to 22 million now - this led to increasing levels of poverty and pressure within the country 's urban areas			2
the researchers said that @entity156 's regime also encouraged water intensive crops like cotton for export while illegal drilling of irrigation wells rapidly depleted groundwater			0
in the worst hit north east areas of the country , livestock herds were practically obliterated , cereal prices doubled and nutrition - related diseases among children increased dramatically			0
@entity171 , a student at the school of international and public affairs at @entity82 who also took part in the research , said that this led to 1.5 million people moving from the countryside to the cities			1
the initial 2011 uprising and subsequent civil war has now mutated into a complex battle between factions , like the @entity184 pictured above , islamic state fighters and the @entity156 regime writing in the journal , the authors said : ' rapid demographic change encourages instability			1
' whether it was a primary or substantial factor is impossible to know , but drought can lead to devastating consequences when coupled with preexisting acute vulnerability			0
' it is the first study of its kind to look at how climate change has played a role in a current war			0
professor @entity201 , a public policy researcher at the @entity202 , said similar climatic changes had triggered the collapse of the @entity205 in the region 4,200 years ago following a drought lasting several years			0
however , @entity209 , an environmental scientist at @entity210 , said : ' there were many things going on in the region and world at that time , such as high global food prices and the beginning of the @entity217 , that could have also increased the likelihood of civil conflict			2

study finds that @entity2 suffered the worst drought on record before the war
researchers say rainfall in the region fell by 10 *%* between 2006 and 2010
agricultural production in @entity2 fell by a third while the population *soared*
this led to an influx of people into cities causing rising poverty and unrest
this eventually led to the uprising that led to civil war breaking out in 2011
scientists say drought was likely worsened by man - made global warming
the research was conducted by scientists at @entity82 in @entity83
