@entity0 is to drop both the @entity1 and @entity3 brand names in favour of just using @entity5			1
the company is beginning a transition to change all of its branding to simply @entity5 , just in time for the holiday season			2
the @entity10 firm @entity1 will live on as a separate company , though , focusing on mapping and network infrastructure			1
a report by @entity15 says @entity0 is preparing to axe the @entity1 name			2
the change by the @entity19 firm will see phones simply called @entity5 from now on ( @entity5 730 shown )			1
both the @entity1 brand name and @entity3 are being dropped in the shake - up of @entity0 's phone business the change was first reported by @entity15 and has now been confirmed by @entity25 on their @entity27 page			1
they wrote : ' in the coming days , you will receive a @entity27 message regarding the change of name of this page			2
' we are on the verge of becoming " @entity5 ! " ' stay - tuned for more soon			0
' the move brings an end to @entity1 ’s name being on mobile phones , a long run that stretches back into the 1980s			2
' some of today ’s press reports related to rumours about @entity0 dropping the @entity1 brand have declared the death of the @entity1 brand , ' said @entity46 , executive vice president , marketing and corporate affairs			1
' but , to paraphrase @entity47 , “ reports of our death are an exaggeration			0
” ' yes , we have sold our mobile phone business to @entity0			1
but the @entity1 of today is financially robust and has moved from weakness to strength			0
' we have one of the world ’s best telecom infrastructure businesses , a global leader in the mapping and location business , a stellar intellectual property portfolio and some of the finest innovation capabilities of any company anywhere			0
' remember , @entity1 started almost 150 years ago with just one paper mill. over time we have repeatedly and successfully reinvented ourselves			0
' we may not be the same @entity1 of several years ago , but we are here , we are strong , and our brand is very much still alive			0
not to mention kicking ! ' it was first hinted at when @entity0 moved @entity1 to be hosted on @entity0 ’s own site			0

@entity0 bought @entity1 ’s phone business in april in a £ 4.5 billion ( $ 7.2 billion ) deal			1
it ’s unclear if the changes will affect existing @entity0 smartphones though , or only ones set to be released in the future			1
@entity1 phones will likely elicit fond memories for many , though , with the @entity81 in particular being one of the defining phones at the dawn of the cell phone age			2
first released towards the end of 2000 , the phone went on to sell 126 million units world wide and continues to enjoy a cult status			0
@entity1 has been quick to assure customers that the company will live on , albeit no longer in the mobile phone business			1
