' designed with imagination ' : with several fellow engineers , he has since designed and built eight miniature submarines mainly designed for harvesting aquatic products , such as sea cucumber but is it safe ? the wrought - iron submarines have enough room for two people , a diving depth of 66 - 98ft , and can travel for up to 20 hours			0
