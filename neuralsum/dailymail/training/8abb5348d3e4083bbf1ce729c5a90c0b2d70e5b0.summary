when my mother was diagnosed with terminal of breast cancer , she was devastated but also surprised because , as she put it , ' we were n't a cancer family '			1
there was no strong history of the disease whatsoever			1
her mother had died of lung failure after years of smoking and other relatives had succumbed to heart disease			1
an @entity17 cousin had died of breast cancer , but that felt , both genetically and geographically , far removed			1
but eight years later , at the end of 2010 , i was told that i was a carrier of the @entity22 mutation - an genetic abnormality which makes me far more likely than non-carriers to get breast cancer			1
it also makes me highly susceptible to ovarian cancer			1
@entity29 is pictured with her son @entity30 and daughter @entity30			1
she says that having children made the decision to undergoing a double mastectomy easier to make the lifetime chance of a woman developing breast cancer is 10 per cent , but this goes up to 80 per cent if they possess a mutated brca gene			1
the gene also raises the risk of developing ovarian cancer from 1.4 per cent to up to 40 per cent			1
my brother had been urging me for several months to take the brca test			2
but i did n't think it was necessary - given our cancer - free family history , it had never occurred to me that my mother ’s cancer was a result of a genetic fault			1
eventually i decided to go ahead - but more to shut him up than because i was concerned about being a carrier			2
i was living in @entity57 at the time with my husband and son @entity30 , now 6 , and @entity30 , 5			2
i had an excellent gp who managed to find a @entity64 geneticist who could arrange the tests			0
at my first visit , he told me that i would have to undergo several genetic counselling sessions to help me decide whether or not to have the test			2
but i told him that i was already decided			0
i would do the test at my next visit			0
i reassured him that if i were found to have the mutation , i would have a mastectomy and an oophorectomy			2
@entity29 , pictured with her two children , said that she did n't think she needed the @entity77 test because there was no history of the cancer in the family			1
she had believed her mother 's cancer was simply a case of bad luck			1
@entity29 wanted another baby before she underwent preventative surgery but her husband @entity88 ( pictured ) said that this was n't a good reason to have another child i have since realised how very easy it is to say things when you do n’t ever imagine you will have to act on them			1
a small phial of blood was taken and shipped off to a laboratory in the @entity17 when i went to collect my results several weeks later , i saw them before i heard them			0
the report was on a table between the doctor and myself			0
various markers had been analysed and i could see that next to @entity22 it said ' deleterious '			0
i had n’t even heard of that word before that afternoon , let alone understood its meaning			0
now i know only too well			0
@entity29 plans to undergo a double mastectomy next month and possibly have her ovaries removed when she reaches 40 it means lying in bed at night , checking for breast lumps and living with the anxiety that the next lump you discover is going to be cancer			1
it means going for yearly mammograms and bi-annual mris and ultrasounds and waiting nervously for the results			0
the alternative is to undergo prophylactic surgery – the removal of both breasts and the ovaries to greatly reduce my chances of getting cancer			1
nearly everyone i told about my mutation seemed to think it was a no - brainer			0
' i would have it done tomorrow , ' was the stock response			0
i know that the people who said this had my best interests at heart , but would they really feel like that if they were in my position ? admittedly , neither breasts nor ovaries are vital organs – i could easily survive without them			2
they do n’t help you walk , write or speak			0
yet , they are an intrinsic part of my identity - my sexuality and my sense of femininity			0
when discussing the possibility of an oophorectomy at the age of 40 with my gynaecologist , i joked to him that it would ' complete the sex - change ' , while silently weeping inside			2
my breasts and my ovaries have defined turning points in my life – the transitions from girlhood to adolescence , to womanhood and latterly to motherhood			2
there is a cruel irony that something that creates and nurtures life so beautifully , can turn out to be the greatest threat to your own survival			0
when i first heard the news i was a @entity22 carrier , i told my husband that we needed to have another baby – and fast			0
i had a strong desire to use these procreating parts of me one last time before they were swiped away on the operating table			0
he reasoned with me , saying that my mutation was not a reason to have another child			0
more importantly , i do need to stick around for the two beautiful children i already have			0
so rather than spend the rest of my life anxiously waiting for cancer , which may or may not happen , i intend to reduce my chances drastically			2
in the coming month , i plan to undergo a double mastectomy – with sizable reconstruction as my happy returns			1
i ’ll have my ovaries and fallopian tubes removed at 40			1
while my mum was right about many things , sadly her take on the family ’s genetic makeup was incorrect			2
we are a cancer family and will continue to be until someone discovers a cure			1
in the meantime , i need to get on with trying to prevent it .			0

@entity209 had no family history of cancer until her mother died of disease
she believed that her mother 's illness had been merely a case of bad luck
but after her brother urged her to get tested she discovered she had gene
@entity29 , *37* , now plans to undergo a double mastectomy next month and may have her ovaries removed when she is 40
