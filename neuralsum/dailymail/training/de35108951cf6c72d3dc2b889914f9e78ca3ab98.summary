@entity174 - winning @entity52 , director of the documentary , said : ' what kind of message does that send out to the army ? that they can get away with it			0
' speaking to the soldiers was very unnerving			0
the young one showed no remorse			0
' he was boastful , inflating numbers			0
' older , more educated soldiers have been taught that rape is an abuse of human rights , that it is a crime			1
so the older soldier was more of a pathetic character - in the real sense of the word pathetic			0
' he was clutching the @entity54 and kept saying how bad he felt			0

so really , we need solutions for what can be put into action ; specific ideas			0
' we need teams of experts on the ground			0
