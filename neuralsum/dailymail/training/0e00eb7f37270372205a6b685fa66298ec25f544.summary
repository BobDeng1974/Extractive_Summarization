by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:57 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 10:20 est , 26 september 2013 a packed passenger jet heading to the @entity4 was left flying on autopilot when both pilots fell asleep at the controls , it emerged last night			1
the terrifying incident happened last month on board an @entity10 operated by a @entity4 - based airline - but officials are refusing to name the company involved			1
the pilots - who had apparently slept for just five hours each over the previous two nights - are not expected to face serious disciplinary action over the incident , which highlights the danger of fatigue on flights			1
danger : both pilots on an @entity10 similar to this one fell asleep at the controls during a recent flight the @entity25 revealed that the incident took place on august 13 shortly after the 325 - seat plane had taken off , when the pilot and co-pilot agreed to take turn having short naps , leaving the plane on auto - pilot			1
however , one of them woke up to discover that they had both been asleep at the same time , and did not know how long the plane had been unsupervised			0
the pilots voluntarily reported the blunder to the @entity25 , which has hidden the name of the airline they work for in a bid to encourage other whistleblowers to speak out			1
a spokesman for the regulator said : ‘ i would be very surprised if any disciplinary action had been taken against these pilots			2
‘ perhaps the airline in question may have looked at their rosta or shift system as a result			2
‘ in potentially critical safety situations like this , we aim to learn from what happened and ensure it will not happen again			1
’ he added : ' we do n't know why the pilots had had so little sleep before this flight			1
they were taking it in turn to have rest periods , with the one always checking the autopilot and it looks as if both fell asleep at the same time			0
' @entity70 : the pilots ( not pictured ) are not believed to have faced serious disciplinary action by law , airline bosses must report any potentially dangerous conduct to the industry regulator			1
@entity77 , which operates a fleet of 10 a330 planes , said : ' @entity77 can confirm no safety reports have been received about pilots falling asleep simultaneously whilst in control of an aircraft			1
' the airline ’s primary concern is the safety and welfare of passengers and crew			1
@entity77 strictly adheres to and supports all @entity25 regulations			0
' spokesmen for @entity92 and @entity93 , which each have three @entity95 , said that the plane involved did not belong to them			0
aviation officials are set to investigate whether some pilots ' poor grasp of @entity100 is putting lives at risk			2
foreign pilots and air traffic controllers are supposed to speak ' aviation english ' , the international language of communication in air travel			2
but reports suggest that many do not speak the language well , leading to potential safety issues which could lead to serious accidents			2
the @entity25 has commissioned a report from expert @entity115 of @entity116 on the use of @entity118 worldwide			0
a spokesman said : ' we have seen some recent indications that pilots ' proficiency when communicating in aviation @entity100 is not at the necessary level at all times			0
' while we have seen nothing to suggest there is a major issue here , as the @entity4 's aviation regulator , safety is our number one priority and we believe it is sensible to examine the issue more thoroughly and have commissioned dr @entity135 to do just that			1
' dr @entity135 , a linguist and anthropologist , added : ' this project shows that the @entity4 recognises the need to maintain clear and unambiguous communication in aviation , and is treating it as a serious matter			1
' @entity143 said in a statement : ' the project will explore how existing methods of maintaining clarity can be enhanced to reduce or eliminate language - related problems , which can contribute to accidents or serious incidents			0
' pilots ' union @entity153 said that it had repeatedly warned the @entity25 about the dangers of pilots feeling overly tired , and accused the regulator of being ' complacent ' about the problem			0
general secretary @entity158 said : ' @entity4 pilots want to make every flight a safe flight and tiredness is the biggest challenge they face			1
' as the regulator responsible for @entity4 flight safety the @entity25 has been far too complacent about the levels of tiredness among @entity4 pilots and failing to acknowledge the scale of the underreported problem			1
' the problem of fatigue among pilots was revealed in a study by @entity153 which showed that 45 per cent of the pilots surveyed had suffered from ‘ significant fatigue ’			1
the figures revealed that about 20 per cent of pilots believe their performance is ‘ compromised ’ more than once a week			1
many pilots said they now have to fly more than regulation hours to deal with the volume of flights on offer from airlines			0
records show that two cockpit crew members fell asleep during a long - haul flight in 2011			0
one of the pilots was asleep for ten minutes while his co-pilot slept during his break			0
in another case in 2012 , a pilot was unable to gain entry to the cockpit and , after using an entry code to access the cockpit , found his first officer was asleep			0
while nearly all such cases are resolved without any danger , fatigue has been blamed for high - profile aviation accidents in the past			0
the pilot of an @entity205 flight which plunged into the ocean in 2009 , killing all 228 people on board , had only one hour 's sleep the night before , it emerged this year			2
@entity210 , the head of safety at the @entity212 , told the @entity213 last year that often pilots do n’t complain about being tired because they are worried about being punished			2
@entity153 claims that new @entity216 regulations on pilots ' working hours set to be voted on next week could increase the risk of similar incidents by tiring out workers			2
pilots will be able to land an aircraft after going 22 hours without sleep , fly long - haul flights with fewer crew members and operate early - morning flights up to seven days in a row			0
the union says the changes will ' increase tiredness among pilots and the risk of dangerous incidents '			0
however , the @entity25 said today : ' we understand that @entity153 are not happy with the proposals but we think overall it is a good package and not much different to what we have now			0

terrifying incident happened last month on board a @entity4 flight
but pilots from *unnamed* airline are unlikely to be seriously disciplined
fifth of pilots say their safety is *endangered* by fatigue at least once a week
