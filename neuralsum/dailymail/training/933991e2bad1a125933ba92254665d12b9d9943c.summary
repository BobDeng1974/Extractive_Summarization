by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the @entity4 administration is poised to entertain a flood of new clemency applications from thousands of federal prisoners who were given harsh sentences under mandatory - minimum laws following drug convictions , attorney general @entity2 said monday			1
@entity2 said in a short videotaped statement that he wants to shrink the federal prison population by a modest amount while ensuring ' that those who have paid their debts have a chance to become productive citizens			2
' at the center of the move is a set of old sentencing rules that punished crack - cocaine offenders with more time behind bars than users or traffickers of powder cocaine			1
civil rights groups have claimed the practice amounted to racial bias since crack – a solid , smokable form of the highly addictive drug , has been more popular in @entity37 , inner - city communities since its introduction to the @entity1 in the early 1980s			0
the announcement is part of an ongoing @entity4 administration push to re-evaluate sentences for drug crimes that officials believe were unduly harsh and were imposed under old federal guidelines that treated convictions for crack cocaine offenses more punitively than those involving the powder form of the drug			1
the @entity81 - led ' @entity83 ' era included dramatic increases of some mandatory sentences , a move designed to crush networks of narcotics dealers and sweep the streets clean			1
@entity2 suggested monday that the move had n't achieved its goal , and had left thousands languishing in custody unfairly			1
' there are still too many people in federal prison who were sentenced under the old regime – and who , as a result , will have to spend far more time in prison than they would if sentenced today for exactly the same crime , ' he explained in his video			0
' this is simply not right			0
' reactions were partisan and swift			0
' what you see is a moral imperative being seized on by the @entity111 , ' a @entity106 strategist in @entity107 told @entity112			1
' this is the stuff of legacy building			2
' a @entity81 election consultant , also in @entity107 , countered that president @entity4 's timing was suspect			1
' is n't it an election year ? ' he asked			2
anything to distract his base from the miserable failure of @entity126			0
' in december @entity4 announced that he had commuted the sentences of eight federal drug convicts , including six who were handed life sentences			1
' each of them has served more than 15 years in prison , ' the president noted at the time			0
' in several cases , the sentencing judges expressed frustration that the law at the time did not allow them to issue punishments that more appropriately fit the crime			0
' a month later the @entity53 issued guidance encouraging @entity1 defense lawyers to help drug offenders with no history of violence to start the process of appealing to the @entity111 for clemency			1
in the 1980s the advent of cheaper ' crack ' cocaine rocks brought the drug a wider market , and it quickly became a drug of choice in the black community in the @entity1 @entity156 of @entity157 , @entity158 ( @entity159 ) was given a 292 month sentence in 1997 for possession with intent to deliver cocaine base and marijuana , and @entity165 of @entity166 , ( r ) got a life sentence the same year for conspiracy to possess cocaine base with intent to distribute ; @entity4 freed them both in december international : drug trafficking is a trillion - dollar business worldwide , with much of the narcotics smuggled into the @entity1 and other nations through increasingly ingenious methods like this cache stowed inside heavy machinery the @entity4 administration has begun to add dozens of lawyers to the legal staff assigned to handle such applications			1
historically , very few have been approved			0
but that could change soon , now that @entity2 has opened the door for a new criterion : the difference between an existing sentence and oen that would be handed down today in similar circumstances			2
' the @entity53 is committed to recommending as many qualified applicants as possible for reduced sentences , ' @entity2 said			2
@entity111 press secretary @entity193 told reporters on monday that he could n't estimate how many felons would be released			0
' in terms of how many deserving candidates are out there , i could n't begin to speculate , ' he said			0
@entity200 , executive director of the @entity201 , told the @entity202 that he was excited by the prospect of a sudden break from the past inertia in clemency applications			0
' what you see is some focused attention on the part of the administration to deal with this in a serious way , ' he told the @entity202 members of @entity214 quizzed @entity2 this month in a @entity216 hearing , with @entity218 @entity217 rep. @entity217 asking why broader groups of clemency applications from @entity1 convicted of ' white - collar crime or campaign finance laws or a host of other areas that have been over-criminalized , all who also do the [ prison ] overcrowding that we ’re very concerned with , but have a much lower recidivism rate			1
' ' we ’re dealing with a particular problem , ' @entity2 replied , ' and that is that i think the pendulum swung a little too far in the ’ 80s ' with drug enforcement .			0

attorney general @entity2 announced that the administration would free convicts who would receive lighter sentences under today 's guidelines
the @entity111 set the stage for the move in december with a clemency trial *balloon* , freeing 8 convicts including 6 with life sentences
@entity106 insiders see the move as a legacy - building *recognition* of a moral *wrong* that @entity4 can right before his presidency ends
@entity81 counter that it 's an election - year stunt meant to break @entity106 *voters* ' *fixation* on the @entity126 *insurance* *system* 's failures
