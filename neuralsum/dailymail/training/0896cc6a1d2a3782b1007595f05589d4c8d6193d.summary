but a spectacular october loss that ended her undefeated streak was leaves her wondering if electing to remove all male hormones has her at a disadvantage against biological females whose bodies create just a little of the endurance - enhancing hormone			1
@entity20 woman : @entity22 fighter @entity1 has faced heaps of criticism over her biological past , but a shocking october end to her undefeated streak has some wondering if her full male to female transition actually puts her at a disadvantage against biological women ' i guess they 'll come out of the woodwork now , ' @entity1 told @entity34 as part of an in - depth profile of the fighter published in the january 2014 issue			1
' they were afraid before , but now they 'll all want to beat a woman who used to be a man			0

' intense : @entity54 trains intensely and has a long - held dream of making it big as a female @entity22 fighter , but her virtual lack of any male hormones could mean biological women -- who produce a small amount of endurance - enhancing testosterone -- are actually at an advantage blind - sided : @entity1 was undefeated until october , when her streak fell to @entity44 and left her in total shock bitter irony : because she no testicles and takes 16 milligrams of estrogen every morning , @entity54 could have significantly less testosterone than some of her female competitors @entity34 speculates that @entity54 , who traveled to @entity75 in 2006 to undergo both top and bottom surgeries , may be experiencing an unwanted side effect from her transition into female			1
biologically , she may be too female			0
like the male testicles , women 's ovaries produce testosterone -- though , in a very small amount			1
also like men , the testosterone can help naturally increase a woman 's endurance			2
@entity54 has neither organs and that fact paired with her heavy daily dose of estrogen means she also has virtually no testosterone			1

@entity1 , 38 , has fought four professional mixed martial arts fights and won three of them
