happy @entity5 - days ! @entity5 poses in some cosy knits for her new @entity10 campaign and says she opts for comfort over sparkly dresses in december ' @entity10 parties for me are less about a sparkly dress and heels and more about the most ridiculous @entity10 jumper i can find			1
' i want to be comfortable so i can eat canapés and drink mulled wine - i do n’t want to be in sequins , i want to be comfy in knitwear			2
' saying this , when it comes to christmas day , i like to wear red			0
i think you have to have one staple red dress in your wardrobe that you can put on and feel festive and fabulous			2
' i have a pretty dress that i only wear on @entity10 , and i always wear something with an elasticated waistband ! ' @entity5 will be spending @entity10 at her mother ’s house , so she can sit , relax , and just eat , drink and be merry			1
she is , however , hosting a @entity41 party at her house , so has shared her tips for a stress - free @entity10 , and also reveals how she manages to do it all and still look gorgeous during the holidays			1
feeling festive : @entity5 says she will be spending @entity10 at her mother 's house and eating lots and drinking mulled wine ' the three main important beauty aspects for me during the festive party season are my lips , lashes and teeth			1
' i smile a lot , especially at @entity10 , so i like to have a nice natural white smile which is why i use @entity13 @entity57 – it really looks after my teeth and helps keep them looking shiny , healthy and removes stains			1
' i also think a red lip at @entity10 is really nice - i love @entity62			1
' combine this with tonnes of @entity66 mascara and a slight shimmer - a wash of bronze across the eye can look lovely			0
' lady in red : @entity5 says she swears by crimson lips and a staple red dress over the festive period @entity5 , who remains unflappable at all times on this morning ( even when dealing with the likes of @entity77 ) , has shared her advice on staying calm over the @entity10 period			1
she said : ' you can take the stress out of @entity10 by trying to be as organised as you possibly can			1
' i try and get all my shopping done before december so all the presents are wrapped in my lounge and ready so i can really relax and enjoy @entity10			2
' if i see things throughout the year that i think someone will like then i buy them then and there			0
' around october / november , i really start cranking it up with shopping ; otherwise @entity10 turns into a panic ! ' i do a lot of shopping online as it ’s so easy			2
i do n’t always get much of a chance to browse around the shops , and i love the fact that you can click " gift wrap "			0
' in bed with @entity5 : miss @entity5 has also unveiled a range of vintage - inspired bedding for @entity101 ' this is originally @entity103 ’s top tip , but … my top tip is to hire in all of the plates , glasses , pots and pans			1
' the moment something is used , it gets put in a box in the garden which then gets collected after @entity10			2
is n’t it a brilliant idea ? particularly if you ’ve got a big family ! '			0
@entity5 has been busy in the run up to @entity10 and last week unveiled her new bedding range for @entity101			1
face compact - @entity118 do a really beautiful one			0
it ’s got a bit of foundation in it , but it ’s more of a powder			0
it ’s a nice , neat compact that ’s great to have in your handbag			0
it helps give a matte complexion , and it also has a shiny strip you can use on your cheeks as a highlighter to give a slightly dewy finish			0
@entity137 - i have a bit of a thing for flossing , i always carry @entity140 floss with me and i love it			2
once you get into it you get addicted ! lip balm - i really like @entity144 as they do a lovely lip balm in a little pink pot and that ’s perfect			1
it ’s brilliant in the winter for when you get dry lips			0
@entity152 - i get through tonnes of mascara			0
i ’m not one of those girls who just puts on a tiny bit			0

eyeliner – @entity163 do a really nice one with a felt tip end , it ’s called @entity166 in noir			2
it ’s really good and helps create a steady line for my ‘ flick ’ .			0
