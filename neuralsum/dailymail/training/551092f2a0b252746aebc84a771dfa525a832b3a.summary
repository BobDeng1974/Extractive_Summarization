by @entity0 published : 05:33 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 11:08 est , 30 january 2013 while her musical back catalogue might not attract many takers , @entity2 's critically - acclaimed fashion line is a different story			0
the designer has announced she is to re-release some of the most popular pieces from past collections , starting next month when the newly revamped victoriabeckham.com website launches			0
named the ' icon collection ' , the range will include reworked versions of best - sellers past , including the tight bandage style frocks worn by @entity16 and @entity17 among others			1
' i am excited to revisit archive designs as the @entity38 collection continues to grow			1
' prices for dresses in the collection , which date from the @entity45 / @entity44 collection onwards , will start at £ 1,000 , and will be sold online			1
speaking of her decision to sell the icon range online , @entity21 said : ‘ together with my personal edit of the @entity51 collections i wanted to be able to offer an exclusive product on the site that was in keeping with the signature aesthetic that ’s very special to me , ’ it 's a decision that puts the @entity2 brand at odds with some of the world 's most iconic fashion houses , including @entity61 , which recently revealed that its clothes will never be sold online			1
' we have to find the right balance for our customers , ' @entity63 , @entity61 ’s president of global fashion , told @entity68			0
' what they want is to feel unique , ' continued @entity63			0
' @entity71 is about clothing , and clothing you need to see , to feel , to understand			0
' a-list favourite : although @entity77 has racked up an impressive celebrity following , the kaiser is @entity79			2
fans include @entity81 ( right ) and @entity82 not online : although fans of @entity61 might want it , the brand has no plans to go online			2

the @entity38 collection will include versions of popular dresses in the @entity77 archive
the collection will be available exclusively through her new *ecommerce* site
unfortunately for fashion fans they do *n't* come cheap : prices start at £ 1,000
