by @entity0 published : 08:33 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 18:59 est , 25 april 2013 sitting in your conservatory is supposed to be a relaxing way of spending a sunny afternoon			0
but for the @entity7 family the sunshine means they are forced to retreat behind blackout curtains after their neighbour installed solar panels			1
they say there is so much glare that their home is lit up ‘ like a tanning salon ’			1
@entity7 says his neighbour 's solar panels give off such a glare his family are permanently blinded by the light @entity7 , 51 , says the position and angle of his neighbour ’s roof means excessive amounts of light are reflected over his garden and into his property			1
he claims his three - bed detached home is now filled with blinding light			2
he also fears the dazzle could permanently damage eyes and despite erecting a large fence , the garden is effectively out of bounds when the sun is shining			0
mr @entity7 , from @entity38 , @entity39 , who lives with his wife @entity40 , 58 , and son @entity41 , 15 , said : ‘ there ’s this huge wall of light pointing straight at you			1
it ’s worse than looking directly at the sun. i ’m really worried it ’s causing us retinal damage			0
‘ it ’s not much better inside			0
we just have to close the curtains and blinds and switch the lights on			2
eco-friendly : the offending solar panels which were put up by @entity55 on his bungalow @entity7 at his house in @entity39 where his neighbour 's solar panels reflect light straight into his house ‘ my son has blackout blinds in his room just so he can escape the glare to do his homework			1
‘ the conservatory is totally unusable as well			0
it ’s almost like living in a giant tanning salon			0
’ the panels belong to neighbour @entity72 , 81			1
mr @entity7 said : ‘ i ’ve invited him over to see the reflection for himself but he would n’t come			1
he thinks we ’re whingeing			0
my problem is with the authorities – they need to do something about this			0
’ mr @entity72 said : ‘ we wanted to do our bit to save energy and help the planet			1
on a good day the panels power the lights and the cooker			2
‘ on the house in front we can see sets of solar panels and there is glare when the sun catches them , but we do n’t mind			2
we just think , “ live and let live ”			0
’ but mr @entity7 , a former engineer , who is unable to work because of long - term health problems , is taking his fight to @entity96 secretary @entity95			2
a spokesman for @entity38 said the panels were erected under permitted development rights , so planning permission was not required			1
heat : @entity7 says the reflections caused by the solar panels are making his family 's lives a misery domestic solar panels became popular with homeowners in 2010 after the introduction of a tax - free feed - in tariffs scheme			1
households are paid for the energy they produce and use themselves and for the electricity they return to the @entity117			0
but the payments are far above market rates , requiring heavy subsidies which rose 14-fold last year			0
the tariff was introduced by @entity123 leader @entity122 when he was environment secretary in @entity125 ’s government			0
earlier this year it was reported his scheme to encourage homeowners to install solar panels and wind turbines is set to cost families an extra £ 1billion in higher bills			2
@entity133 , chairman of the @entity38 branch of the @entity135 , said : ‘ we believe solar panels should be installed on the roofs of agricultural and industrial buildings , as well as homes where appropriate			1
‘ however , the planning system should of course ensure there are no resulting problems affecting neighbouring properties			0
’ view from above : on sunny days light from these solar panels shines straight into the home of @entity7			1

@entity72 , 81 , fitted the panels on top of his bungalow in @entity39
his next door neighbour @entity7 says his home is now lit up
his family have to retreat behind thick curtains to hide from the glare
@entity38 said planning permission was not required
