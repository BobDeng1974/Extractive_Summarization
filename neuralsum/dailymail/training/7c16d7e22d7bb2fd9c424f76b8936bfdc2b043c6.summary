by @entity0 @entity1 has issued a stinging rebuke to @entity3 for daring to suggest that he is ‘ unfit ’ to succeed @entity4			1
the @entity6 mayor fired off a thinly veiled message to the @entity8 to concentrate on getting mr @entity4 re-elected and stop gossiping about the talents of other top @entity10			1
mr @entity1 also fuelled speculation that he will soon announce his intention to return to the @entity13 at the @entity14 next year			1
smiling for the camera : @entity3 with @entity1 last year the @entity16 revealed last month how mr @entity3 , seen by some @entity10 as a future leadership contender , had launched an extraordinary verbal assault on mr @entity1 ’s own credentials			1
the @entity8 stunned guests at a private dinner at the @entity6 home of @entity23 with a wine - fuelled attack , saying : ‘ the whole @entity1 routine will wear thin the electorate very quickly if he became @entity28			1
and he ca n’t make tough decisions			0
’ a ‘ tipsy ’ mr @entity3 added : ‘ @entity1 is incapable of focusing on serious issues and has no gravitas			1
he is n’t a team player and plays to the gallery the whole time			0
’ but challenged to respond to the attacks , mr @entity1 made it clear he thinks it is the education secretary – not him – who is no team player			2
in an interview with @entity40 and @entity41 of @entity42 , mr @entity1 declared : ‘ i ’m at one with the vast majority of the population that wants to hear a lot less about what other conservatives have got to say about each other and much more about what we ’re going to do to win the election			1
’ he implied that senior party figures speculating on each other ’s abilities only detracted from the ‘ mission ’ of getting mr @entity4 re-elected			0
and of his own ambitions , he said : ‘ people want to hear a lot less about my career and anybody else ’s career , and they want to hear a lot about how we are going to stop @entity64 , who would be a disaster			0
’ @entity1 made his attack in an interview with @entity42 , pictured only last week , mr @entity4 stepped up his appeal for mr @entity1 to return to @entity69 , sparking reports of a ‘ bidding war ’ among party activists in safe @entity74 seats desperate for @entity1 to be their mp			1
but asked about mr @entity4 ’s desire to see him ‘ back on the pitch ’ at @entity69 , mr @entity1 replied : ‘ my job is to help the @entity74 cause in any way that i can , by running @entity6 to the best of my ability			2
’ one of the main objections to mr @entity1 returning as an mp – and being able to stand in a @entity74 leadership contest – is that his term as @entity6 mayor still has two years to run			2
but he appeared intrigued by the fact that @entity87 had spent one year being both a @entity88 mp and running @entity89			0
‘ did he ? ’ asked mr @entity1 , before insisting his focus was on being mayor			2
reports last week linked him with at least two safe @entity74 seats that will be vacant at the next @entity94 and @entity95 and @entity96 in @entity97			0
but mr @entity1 would not be drawn on whether he would stand outside the capital , saying : ‘ i ’m playing no such games			0
’ he also laughed off suggestions that he could do a ‘ job swap ’ with dashing @entity101 , @entity74 mp for @entity102 on the outskirts of @entity6 , joking : ‘ the biggest supporters of that are all the women in my office			0
in a very insulting way , they ’ve told me in no uncertain terms the sooner i can swap with @entity101 the better			0
