@entity0 was instructed to remove her headscarf in a crowded foyer at the @entity3 in november last year a breast cancer survivor who was undergoing chemotherapy treatment was left humiliated after being forced to publicly remove her headscarf at a @entity7 court			1
@entity0 , from @entity8 in @entity9 , was checking - in her bag and stepping through the metal detector at @entity3 in november last year when she was stopped by a security guard			1
the 51 - year - old comedian and women 's health advocate told @entity15 that she had been attending a court case to support her daughter , who had been the victim of an assault at @entity19			2
' it was just another day for me , feeling a little uncomfortable and vulnerable about having to be in the same room as the person who assaulted her and smashed her head open , ' ms @entity0 said			1
' i was just going about my business when the male security guard pointed at his colleague who said ' take that off , ' pointing at my headscarf			0
' i said , ' what , you want me to take this off ? i have a bald head underneath '			0
' he said ' yes , you could be hiding something '			0
i just said , ' you want me to take it off now ? ' and he said yes			0
' i 'm normally quite a strong person and would have said ' no. i 'm not doing it here in front of everyone in the foyer ' , but i had just gone through chemo and it 's not easy when you 're standing there with three males surrounding you			0
she was at the court to support her daughter who was the victim of an assault and claims she had never been asked to remove her head - wear on previous court visits ' so i just pulled it off defiantly and said ' are you happy now ? ' i was just really affronted and i was happy to show my bald head to anyone , but at my own choosing , not when ordered in public			1
' ms @entity0 claims that she was never instructed to remove her head - wear during previous court visits			1
she later found out from a female security guard that she could have been offered a private room for the screening			2
the same security guard also told her that the guard who instructed her to remover her scarf ' was new and was probably nervous '			0
since sharing her story on social media last week , ms @entity64 has been astounded by the number of cancer patients who have experienced similar humiliating incidents the comments were posted on the cancer support group , under the @entity73 , @entity75 page @entity76 , ms @entity0 , who underwent a double mastectomy and five months of chemotherapy which she described as ' robbing you of your armour ' , wrote a complaint to the security company about the incident			1
although she was not offered an apology , the general manager of the service responded by assuring her the matter had been investigated and that their process were being reviewed to ensure ' there is not repeat of any matter that may cause undue embarrassment '			0
' my main message is that all women across all sectors of the community - no matter what their headwear - should be treated with dignity and respect , ' ms @entity0 said			1
' i was not given the choice of a private screening and i want women to know they can request this , if it is not offered			2
security is important and necessary - but being forced to remove a headscarf in such an insensitive manner is not acceptable			2
' since sharing her story on social media last week , ms @entity0 has been astounded by the number of cancer patients who have experienced similar humiliating incidents			1
@entity75 user @entity117 , commented with her own experience at @entity7 airport when a security guard ignored his supervisor instructions and she remover he headscarf			0
' he kept insisting that i remove it from my head so i did and when i did you could hear the intake of breath from everyone in the area , ' ms @entity117 wrote			0
' the supervisor quickly came over and apologised and then told me to continue on my way ... i was n't embarrassed about my bald head i just did n't think everyone around me needed to see it			0
