but police got their first and replaced the packet with another containing fake drugs			0
@entity18 , of @entity41 , @entity15 , was jailed for two years when she appeared at @entity43 on friday			2

witnesses reported seeing @entity18 pulling into a petrol station in @entity15 in a @entity63 convertible worth almost £ 40,000 , only for two men to rush at her , snatch the keys and drive away			0
the insurance company did not pay out , and police uncovered the plot when it became clear that @entity18 had put down a £ 25,405 cash deposit for the car when she had no obvious income			1
the crisp packet conspiracy happened on april 5 last year , when @entity18 was seen pulling into a car park outside @entity31			2
conspiracy : @entity18 and @entity17 hatched a plan for skunk cannabis to be smuggled into @entity31 ( pictured ) in a crisp packet , but police foiled the scheme a male associate was then seen to place the crisp packet beneath a tree			1

ignoring other rubbish on the floor , he went straight back to the prison gate but was arrested at the entrance			0
@entity18 was driving the @entity96 again two days later when she was stopped by police			2
