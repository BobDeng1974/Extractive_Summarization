a couple have been awarded £ 1,500 in compensation over a delayed @entity3 flight , three years after their plane was held back on the tarmac			1
@entity7 and @entity8 were travelling to @entity9 to embark on a @entity11 cruise in march 2011 when their flight was delayed at @entity14 for five hours			1
with no extreme weather affecting their travels , the couple from @entity16 , @entity17 , decided to find out if they were entitled to compensation for the inconvenience			1
now @entity32 and mrs @entity8 , who have two children , plan to spend their money on another holiday and may even book their next trip through the travel company			1
speaking of the flight in 2011 , mr @entity39 , 64 , said : ' when we left the house in the morning it was misty but the weather was n't bad			1
' we could hear aircraft going overheard			0
when we arrived at the airport a few flights were delayed but for no more than an hour , including ours			2
' at 10.30am , two hours after they were due to take off , the couple , who have been married for 35 years , were no closer to arriving in @entity9			1
' eventually they said it had been diverted to @entity54 and we could n't figure out why			0
' we were sitting there watching the world go by rather than being on our way to @entity9 , ' the retired customer services trainer added			2
after more than five hours , their flight took off at 1.40pm			2
the couple , pictured in @entity62 ( left ) and @entity63 ( right ) , have saved their entire lives to be able to travel once in retirement			2
they commended the travel company for being ' fair and decent ' mr and mrs @entity8 ( in @entity69 , above ) plan to spend their compensation money on another trip abroad according to the @entity77 , when your flight is affected by disruption , your airline must take care of you and get you to your destination			1
once the disruption has been resolved , you might also be able to claim costs or compensation			0
if the disruption was caused by extraordinary circumstances , then you will not be entitled to compensation , as long as the airline took reasonable measures to avoid the disruption			0
the @entity89 law on flight compensation uses the term ‘ extraordinary circumstances ’ to refer to situations where delays or cancellations have been caused by things that are not inherent in the normal exercise of the activity of the airline and outside of the airline ’s control			2

upon return to the @entity111 , the couple decided to put their case to the @entity77 to see whether or not they could be compensated for the experience			1
' it was more out of curiosity			0
we 'd seen an article which said we could claim so we got in touch			0
' the @entity77 said they thought that @entity3 could n't use the excuse of exceptional circumstance and said we would be able to take action in county court so we did , ' mr @entity39 added			1
after weeks of going back and forth with the company 's lawyers , @entity32 and mrs @entity8 were offered a settlement on november 26 of £ 1,049 with around £ 500 interest			1
' we did it more out of hope than expectation but it 's brilliant			0
' they 've done the right thing , they are a really good company			0
' we 'd never have claimed if it was n't right but we spent hours researching things to check			0
' if the @entity77 said we did n't have a case then we would n't have taken it on , but we were right			1
it was n't our fault			0
' the couple , who saved their whole lives to be able to travel when retired , now plan to spend their settlement on another trip and said they would happily travel with the firm again			0
' it 's not put us off flying with @entity3 at all , as airlines go they 're not the best or the worst			1
' they have been fair and decent with us			0
we 'd definitely fly with them again			0
' but we just think how many other people are entitled to the same as us ? ' @entity3 has not responded to @entity155 's request for comment			1
@entity3 did not respond to @entity155 's request for comment			1
the couple said they had not been put off travelling with the holiday company as they had done ' the fair and right thing '			2
