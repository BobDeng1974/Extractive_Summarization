park life : a woman walks past the councillor @entity6			1
locals reckon it could be the smallest in @entity4 , and even in the world it was created when a group of residents in @entity7 decided to turn the site into an ‘ environmentally aware space ’ featuring plants , free drainage and a recycled bench			2
the councillor @entity6 will soon be pitted against @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 , in a bid to be named @entity4 ’s @entity32			1
there is currently an ongoing debate between residents of @entity29 and @entity36 in @entity37 over which park is the smallest in the world			1
the park in @entity41 , which is two - feet in diameter with soil and some vegetation , has the backing of the @entity46			0
the one in @entity29 is just 15 feet by 30 feet , but they are disputing whether @entity36 ’s is a park at all due to its minuscule size			0
