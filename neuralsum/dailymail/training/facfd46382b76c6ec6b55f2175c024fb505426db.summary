by @entity0 published : 06:22 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 01:59 est , 1 august 2013 @entity3 ’s motorists are becoming a nation of ‘ dashboard dunces ’ baffled by the increasing array of warning lights in their cars , new research has revealed			0
more than nine in ten people failed to recognise one particular warning			1
the study identified 99 separate dashboard light warnings in 15 of the @entity3 ’s most popular cars ranging from the humble @entity16 hatchback to @entity18 executive saloons			0
yet just 12 of the symbol designs were common across all models			1
breakdown firm @entity21 , which commissioned the report , also conducted a survey of 2,018 drivers that revealed more than half of drivers ( 52 per cent ) can correctly identify all 16 of the most common symbols			1
the company said the number of warnings on dashboards varied dramatically from one make to another and highlighted the @entity33 for having 41 compared to 21 in a @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity34			1
the @entity21 poll found that a quarter of motorists have had one or more warning symbols light up while driving in the past 12 months – most commonly the engine , oil or battery lights			1
the @entity33 ( pictured ) had the most symbols with 41 compared to 21 in the @entity35 the most baffling light is for a faulty catalytic converter which was incorrectly identified by 95 per cent of drivers			1
@entity48 for confusion was the air conditioning light which 86 per cent got wrong , followed by a tyre pressure warning that flummoxed 71 per cent			0
nearly half ( 48 per cent ) do not even recognise the brake warning light and more than a third ( 35 per cent ) can not understand an airbag alert , with almost as many ( 27 per cent ) mistaking it for a seat - belt warning			2
dashboard lights commonly inform drivers about problems like poor battery condition , low oil pressure and high engine temperature			0
but many cars now have lights for service interval indicators and seatbelt reminders along with malfunctions ranging from faulty anti-skid stability control to blocked air and fuel filters , defective diesel filters or fuel contaminated by water			2
a @entity21 spokesman said : ’ cars have become so complex that the majority of drivers do n’t understand what all of the most common warning or information lights on a car dashboard mean			1
‘ as in - car technology becomes more advanced there are now more and more in - car gadgets with symbols that support everything from the car ’s sat - nav system to its heating and cooling options			1
' the problem is being exacerbated by the fact that many warning light symbols are specific to a manufacturer or even the individual model			2
’ the majority carry on driving and it takes an average 12 days before they get the problem checked but six per cent admitted they ignored a warning light for more than a month which can be costly			2
drivers who take 14 days to repair their car pay £ 200 , more than double the £ 85 spent by drivers who get cars fixed immediately			0
mercedes – benz @entity3 said its high dashboard symbol count was due to the complex safety systems it fits including ‘ collision prevention assist ’ which boosts the braking force when sensors that monitor the distance of vehicles ahead detect a potential impact			0
spokesman @entity116 said its cars also have more warning lights due to its two - stage system on common items like fuel level which are amber initially and then red if no action is taken : ‘ providing more information is preferable to providing too little			0
' the two - level system does mean there are more symbols on the dashboard			0
some are just to give you a nudge to remind you			0

nine in 10 failed to recognise the sign for a faulty catalytic converter
just 12 of the symbols were common across all car models
a @entity33 has the most symbols with 41 compared to a @entity35 which has 21
