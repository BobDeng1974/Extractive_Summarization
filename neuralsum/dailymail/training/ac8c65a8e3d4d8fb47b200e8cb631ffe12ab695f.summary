by @entity0 published : 06:39 est , 26 november 2013 @entity2 : 07:04 est , 26 november 2013 a mother has been left devastated by a rare condition that leaves her barely able to cuddle her children			0
@entity6 , 31 , suffers from a rare syndrome that causes her constant pain and makes her joints ‘ pop out ’ up to five times a day			1
it means she can barely pick up her one - year - old son @entity12 and has even dislocated her shoulder changing a nappy			1
@entity6 ( pictured with her husband , @entity15 ) has @entity16 which means the collagen in her body is weak so her joints dislocate easily and she is in constant pain mrs @entity6 suffers from @entity16 - a genetic condition which means the collagen in her body is too weak to hold her limbs in place			1
the mother - of - two from @entity24 , @entity25 , said : ‘ my ribs have popped out when i ’ve been picking @entity12 up out of his cot and i ’ve even dislocated my wrist and thumb when changing his nappy			2
‘ my ribs go multiple times a day - it can be something small that sets them off like just shutting a car door			2
‘ it leaves me in so much pain , it ’s like popping the lid on a jar , but now i ’ve learned to deal with it better			2
it was much worse when i was younger and they did n’t know what was happening			0
‘ on my worst days it hurts just to breathe			0
’ mrs @entity6 suffers from type three @entity16 , which means she suffers from joint hypermobility and has long arms and legs			1
mrs @entity6 's joints ' pop out ' up to five times a day and she has dislocated her shoulder , wrist and thumb changing her son 's nappy			1
she is pictured with her children , @entity58 , one , and @entity59 , three she has suffered from the condition since she was a child , but it is notoriously difficult to diagnose			0
it was only when she became pregnant with her first child , @entity59 , now three , that she was diagnosed			1
mrs @entity6 said : ‘ i was in agony			1
i got referred to a specialist and they were sure i had it as soon as i entered the office			0
‘ the situation was so bad i was bedbound for three weeks and they only rolled me once every 24 hours , but otherwise could n’t move me until after the c - section			1
‘ i gave birth eight weeks early			1
they just had to get the baby out of me			2
’ mrs @entity6 was diagnosed when she was pregnant with her first child , @entity59			1
during the pregnancy she was in so much pain she considered not having any more children but eventually decided to have @entity58 ( pictured ) she added : ‘ it ’s a 50 per cent chance of passing it on to your children			2
we wo n’t know for sure until they get older , but @entity59 is already showing symptoms			0
‘ it does worry me			0
if either of them have got it then it ’s come from me			0
’ mrs @entity6 and her husband @entity15 , a builder , thought long and hard before having their second child after the strain it put on mrs @entity6 ’s body first time around			1
she said : ‘ it did put us off having another child , but we planned everything the second time			0
we had a lot of special help			0
‘ we had @entity12 four weeks early as a planned thing			1
we both knew what was happening at every stage of the pregnancy			0
’ mrs @entity6 said : ' it leaves me in so much pain , it 's like popping the lid on a jar , but now i 've learned to deal with it better			1
it was much worse when i was younger and they did n't know what was happening ' but since @entity12 has been born the condition has presented itself in different ways and even picking the baby up out of his bed can leave her in agony			2
she now has a carer who helps her for 14 hours a week			0
she has also taken up dressage for people with disabilities and managed to walk down the aisle without her crutches			0
she said : ‘ originally i wanted to go away and get married somewhere where no - one could see us , but it was actually really nice			2
‘ i had to lean on my dad to get down the aisle and we sat for a lot of the service			0
mrs @entity6 was so ill when she was pregnant with @entity59 that she was bedbound for three weeks and he had to be delivered eight weeks early			1
he is pictured shortly after his birth ‘ @entity15 carried me for a lot of the day , but we were on the beach in the middle of a heat wave so it just looked normal			0
‘ it took me a week to recover			0
i ’ve taken up para-dressage riding and it really helps			2
along with my family it helps keep me sane			1
i think i would otherwise lose the plot with the high levels of pain			2
