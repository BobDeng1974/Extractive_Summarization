but @entity13 , the @entity14 expert who was involved with the release of the original @entity1 films , says these latest images are nothing but ‘ utter b * * * * * * * ’			1
@entity8 - based magazine , @entity7 , who says it found the footage , is adamant about its authenticity after doing a frame - by - frame analysis it has since became apparent that the footage was taken from the film @entity29 starring @entity30 , released back in 2006			1
according to @entity32 , who specialises in studying @entity14 film footage , the footage is the work of artist @entity35 who has confirmed he made the alien being			1

it has since became apparent that the footage was taken from the film @entity29 starring @entity30 , released back in 2006			1
pictured is a scene from the film ‘ others think we are getting close to the day of full disclosure about the alien presence in our skies , and stories like this are being leaked out to get us accustomed to this idea			2
’ @entity1 , @entity42 sprang to international fame on july 8 , 1947 , when the local newspaper reported the capture of a ' flying saucer ' by government officials in the town			2

due to public pressure , internal investigations were launched by the @entity107 to disclose the truth			0
their first report , in 1995 , confirmed that the wreckage was of a @entity113 balloon			0
in 1997 , their second report looked at the rumours and stories about recovered alien bodies			0
this concluded that they were a combination of rumours , and half - forgotten memories of missions involving the recovery of injured pilots or anthropomorphic dummies			0
