@entity1 's children plan to skip college next fall to talk about their dad with @entity6 voters , but the @entity8 governor has stopped short of formally saying he is running for president			1
so , too , has former @entity11 gov. @entity10			0
he carefully avoided declaring himself a candidate for the @entity14 nomination even though his two - day visit to this early nominating state had all of the marks of a @entity20 bid			1
welcome to cagey and often absurd early stages of this campaign for president			0
@entity1 delivered remarks on saturday , in which he called for more state and local control over education - as well as a stronger @entity30 foreign policy			1
and each , like the others who have been or soon will be coming , are taking great pains to avoid stating the obvious and triggering the headaches that come with being a full - blown candidate			0
but there are plenty of slips along the way , such as when @entity1 disclosed saturday that his 19 - and 20 - year - old sons plan to ditch college this fall			1
' they twisted our arms to figure out a way to maybe take part of a semester off next year , next fall , to come to @entity6 , to come around the country and talk to young people like themselves , ' @entity1 said			1
@entity1 also promised he would return to @entity6 often , even though he was circumspect on why the governor of a @entity67 state would take such a shine to @entity6 if he were n't running for the @entity14 nomination			1
' we 'll be back many more times to @entity6 , ' he promised			2
not waiting for @entity1 to make official his candidacy , union members rallied outside the political event			2
@entity1 as governor has dramatically rolled back union rights in his state and labor groups are already running their own campaign against his bid			1
a similar wink and nod came from @entity10 , who drew a large number of out - of - state reporters to his meetings with business leaders in southern @entity6 on friday			2
@entity1 made his appearance in @entity6 , a launching pad for presidential election campaigns because its primary is the first in the country , a week after signing a so - called ' right - to - work ' bill			1
the law prevents labor unions in @entity8 from forcing workers to pay dues , but opponents contend its underlying goal is to undermine organized labor			2
@entity1 has embraced the issue of limiting the power of unions as his signature cause , making him the target of a failed recall campaign three years ago			2
before @entity1 ’s speech at @entity36 , union members protested outside , holding signs that said , ' stop the war on workers , ' and ' @entity1 : stop trashing the middle class			1
' speaking in a full auditorium , @entity1 said he would not be cowed by those who disagreed with him			2
' they seek to intimidate , ' @entity1 said			2
' but we never lost focus			0
we did what we had to do , and that ’s what ’s needed in @entity30 today			0
' overseas interaction : @entity1 also called for a stronger @entity30 foreign policy , calling ' radical islamic terrorism ' the greatest security threat facing the @entity30 @entity1 made his appearance in @entity6 , a launching pad for presidential election campaigns because its primary is the first in the country , a week after signing a so - called ' right - to - work ' bill @entity1 has embraced the issue of limiting the power of unions as his signature cause , making him the target of a failed recall campaign three years ago			1
protesters are seen outside his saturday event the ' right - to - work ' issue has been contentious in @entity6			2
legislators have sponsored several bills to make union membership optional , but the legislation failed to clear both chambers and would have faced certain vetoes by @entity149 governors			0
in his speech , @entity1 called for more state and local control over education , a position that distinguished him from @entity10 , who has backed the controversial @entity156 national standards			1
@entity1 also called for a stronger @entity30 foreign policy , calling ' radical islamic terrorism ' the greatest security threat facing the @entity30			1
@entity1 was quoted by the @entity160 as saying ' we need a president who will do whatever it takes , whatever it takes			0
who understands we have an ally in @entity168 and we should start acting like it			0
who understands that radical @entity172 terrorism is like a virus and if you do n't take it out entirely , it 's like a virus in your computer that will keep coming back			1
' the @entity14 governor also reportedly said at the event that he was wearing a $ 1 @entity183 's sweater and also described a teenage job at @entity185			1
@entity1 , the @entity160 reported , ' earned an enthusiastic response from the crowd in @entity188			0
' @entity1 also took aim at @entity149 president @entity190 and polices he said measured success based on how many people were dependent on the government			2
' we should measure success on just the opposite , on how many are not dependent on the government , ' @entity1 said			0
@entity198 , 81 , a resident of the nearby town of @entity200 , said @entity1 ’s message resonated with him			0
' he wants to bring government closer to the people , back to the towns and cities			0
' @entity206 , the @entity6 @entity14 chairwoman , told the @entity207 ' it was a great day for the @entity14 , no question about it			1
we had 400 grass - roots activists together , energized , excited			0
obviously , gov. @entity1 was very well - received			0
' ex-new @entity6 state senator and @entity1 supporter @entity213 told @entity216 ' he just comes across as a very straightforward guy and i think he has a very unique voice to speak to the center			1
' the television station reported that the majority of people present have n't picked a @entity14 primary candidate to back yet			1
@entity225 reported that @entity1 also dismissed the the idea he 's a ' flip - flopper ' on issues saturday , saying the term is ' just a narrative from the other campaigns that are frustrated with the fact that we 've got a strong reputation of keeping our word			2
' according to the news outlet , @entity1 did acknowledge changing his immigration views			0
competition : former @entity11 governor @entity10 speaks with members of the media after visiting a packed house party on friday , march 13 , 2015 , in @entity242 , @entity6 meanwhile , @entity10 said ' i have brought all my friends from outside of @entity6 to come do their part to enhance the economic climate of @entity248			2
' and when asked how he , as president , would confront @entity251 militants , @entity10 made a point of saying he was not yet a candidate for the office			0
' i get really nervous about not triggering a campaign with all of these people around , ' @entity10 said			0
each of the likely candidates is coached to couch their ambitions in hypotheticals			0
@entity1 's ' not being a declared candidate ' caveat and @entity10 's ' i 'm considering the possibility of running ' statements are merely formalities at this point			1
several candidates are likely to start taking the next steps in april , and most have been laying the groundwork for a campaign for months if not years			0
for instance , @entity1 was tardy for a state party training session saturday morning because he was held up in private meetings with those he hopes will back his campaign in waiting			1
on his dance card on this trip : former gov. @entity281 , former sen. @entity282 , @entity284 mayor @entity283 , state senate president @entity277 and county party chairs			0
