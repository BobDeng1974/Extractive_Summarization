by @entity0 published : 11:05 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 11:32 est , 22 november 2012 when @entity2 stepped into @entity5 restaurant @entity3 last night for @entity7 's birthday party last night wearing a skintight leather dress , it was a wonder one of the sushi chefs did n't chop off his finger in shock			1
the @entity14 singer and former x factor star looked jaw - dropping in the stretch mustard number , a £ 1,800 piece from @entity18 and @entity20 's luxury label @entity21			0
but for those of us without an a-list bank account , is it possible to get a flash of that @entity28 magic in our wardrobes ? getting leathered ! @entity2 looked stunning last night in a light tan leather dress for bandmate @entity7 's birthday party at @entity32 restaurant @entity3 the short answer is yes			1
leather brand @entity34 have a lookalike tan leather dress , which is available at @entity37 for £ 150 , and currently discounted at £ 115 at @entity38			2
of course , the @entity40 version is less likely to cling in all the right places in the way that @entity2 's does			2
leaving aside for a moment the fact that most of us could only dream of having the body of the petite yet curvy star , the leather on the designer version is stretchy and buttersoft - making it comfortable and flattering to wear			0
credit : £ 1,800 ( @entity52 ) @entity2 's leather dress cost £ 1,800 from the @entity20 's brand @entity21			1
cash : £ 150 ( right ) @entity34 's version is on sale for £ 150 at @entity37 and has been reduced to £ 115 in the sale at @entity38 the @entity40 version likely does not have the same element of stretch ( it is very costly to create buttersoft leather with decent stretch , hence why @entity64 's leather jeans sell for upwards of £ 800 and @entity67 's stretch leather leggings are a credit card - scorching £ 645			1
but for the price and the overall appeal of the look , the bargainista 's leather dress ca n't be beaten			0
surprisingly enough , a leather dress is a more versatile garment than you 'd think too			0
glam up with glossy hair , a slash of red lipstick and bare legs for a high maintenance look , or dress down with tights , boots and a chunky cardigan for weekend wear .			0

@entity2 's stretch leather dress is by @entity89 ' brand @entity21
