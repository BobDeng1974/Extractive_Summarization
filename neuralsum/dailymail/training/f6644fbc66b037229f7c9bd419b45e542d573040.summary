@entity0 have got their mojo back			0
a club that has been on an upward trajectory for the past four - and - half years was seeing all that hard work beginning to disintegrate with the acrimonious departure of @entity7 and the unimaginative appointment of @entity9			0
@entity0 know they will never be able to compete with the biggest sides in the land , but the @entity0 thrive on being the cool kid in the @entity15 playground			1
@entity9 rues a missed opportunity against @entity17 as @entity0 fans watch on impressing neutrals with their guts , passion and eccentricities is in this club 's fibre , and those attributes have all been sadly lacking since august , having been so proudly prominent last season			0
but now , with the impending appointment of @entity28 , @entity0 are back in the limelight			1
make no mistake , there 's plenty for @entity28 to do if @entity0 are to stay up , but the news of his impending appointment alone has already breathed oxygen in to an atmosphere that was becoming toxic			2
@entity28 is no @entity38 , he 's no @entity39 either , but @entity0 fans know he 's one of them - and his managerial record is n't bad			2
@entity43 manager of the year in 2012 with @entity44 , @entity0 supporters could not have hoped for any better given the situation they currently find themselves in			1
@entity0 players react after conceding against @entity50 earlier this month @entity28 is set to leave @entity44 to take over as @entity0 manager @entity28 's appointment will restore fans ' faith in @entity55 and the club 's board , too			1
while @entity0 2010 - who saved @entity0 from liquidation that year - will always be universally popular among the @entity61 faithful , their decision - making regarding the departure of @entity7 and the appointment of @entity9 has come in for serious criticism in some quarters			0
with the transfer window opening this week , @entity28 's presence should be enough in itself to attract the players capable of keeping @entity0 in the top flight			2
at any rate , major surgery is not required			0
this , after all , is a squad that finished 11th last season and was significantly improved upon in the summer - hence the frustration with how things were going under @entity9			2
@entity9 was doing nothing for @entity0 's street - cred , which hit its highest point in the early 1990s when @entity28 was a player			0
@entity28 's winner against @entity82 in the 1990 @entity84 semi-final is well documented but their performance that year was not a flash in the pan			0
the following season , with him in midfield , @entity0 finished third in the old @entity90			1
@entity28 celebrates his winner against @entity82 in the 1990 @entity84 semi-final at @entity93 no one is expecting @entity0 to be able to do that again any time soon but with one of their own in charge - a man who just so happens to be one of the most experienced and proven @entity15 managers around - pride can start coursing through those red and blue veins again			1
the silence at what proved to be @entity9 's final game against @entity107 on @entity108 was deafening			0
however this reunion between club and cult hero goes , the decibel level will be off the scale when @entity115 visit on january 10 for @entity28 's return to @entity61 .			1

@entity28 set to leave @entity44 to take over at @entity0
