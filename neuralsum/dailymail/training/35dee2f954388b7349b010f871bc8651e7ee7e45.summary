@entity2 , 40 , claims miss @entity6 would play her own singles and perform karaoke at the top of her voice			1
her favourites were said to include @entity22 , @entity20 and @entity23 ’s @entity24			1
miss @entity2 said she complained , but in return miss @entity6 and other neighbours accused her of anti-social behaviour – and @entity28 and her disabled ten - year - old daughter @entity29 were told to leave their rented house by their landlord in october			1
the singer then rented the property and plans to buy it so she can convert the two semis , both former council houses , into a detached six - bedroom home			0

‘ i ’ve been through hell , ’ she said			0

it would go on most days , one time until after 10pm			0
‘ now i ’ve been turfed out			0
i just do n’t know why anyone would want to build a six - bedroom house in the middle of a council estate			0

the entertainer , who lives with her cat in a former council house in @entity63 , @entity64 , has amassed an estimated £ 22million after selling more than 20million copies of her five studio albums			0
next door : the stars home and the one @entity28 rented			0
one night it went on until 10pm , she claims miss @entity2 , a single mother whose daughter has muscle problems , said she used to get on well with her neighbour and voted for her on @entity76 ’s @entity75 in 2009			1
but while miss @entity6 would sing occasionally , her performances became ‘ unbearable ’ after finding fame			1
‘ she used to sing @entity22 over and over again			0
it sounded like she was doing a karaoke , ’ @entity28 said			2
‘ something played the backing music and she would do the singing			2
she always used a microphone			0

miss @entity2 said : ‘ i was devastated			1
we have n’t spoken to @entity6 since			2
she ’s got the full building to herself now so she can blare it out all she wants			0

she continues to enjoy living there and enjoys good relationships with her neighbours			0
’ miss @entity2 ’s landlord mrs @entity108 said : ‘ we served @entity2 with a notice to quit because there were three serious issues with that tenancy			1
