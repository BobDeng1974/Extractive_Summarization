stripped of its skin , and showing every bone and sinew , this gory display of an elephant is part of the latest exhibition from the infamous dr @entity7			1
body worlds : @entity9 , in which animal carcasses are preserved and displayed , opens today at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13			1
created by plastinator dr @entity7 and curator dr. @entity16 , the exhibition offers visitors an ' anatomical safari ' past nearly one hundred anatomically dissected animals			1
the graphic exhibition features @entity21 the elephant which , at 3.2 tons and a size of 6 by 3.5 metres , is the largest whole animal ever plastinated			1
@entity21 is joined by a gorilla packing 120 kilograms of muscle , watched on by its human close relative , as well as a giraffe , bear , shark and many more			2
' it is fascinating to see the anatomical similarities of the vertebrates on the one hand , and how many different anatomical variations have formed on the other hand in response to an animal 's living conditions — such as the elephant 's trunk or the giraffe 's long neck , ' says the curator dr. @entity16 on the exhibition website			1
embalming and @entity60 halts decay by pumping formalin into the body through the arteries			2
using dissection tools , the skin , fatty and connective tissues are removed in order to prepare the individual anatomical structures			1
removal of @entity73 and water the body water and soluble fats are dissolved from the body by placing it into an acetone bath			2
forced @entity78 reactive polymer - silicone rubber - replaces the acetone			1
the specimen is immersed in a polymer solution and placed in vacuum chamber			2
the vacuum removes the acetone from the specimen and helps the polymer to penetrate every last cell			2
positioning after vacuum impregnation , the body is positioned as desired			0
every single anatomical structure is properly aligned and fixed with the help of wires , needles , clamps , and foam blocks			1
curing ( @entity95 ) the specimen is hardened with gas , light , or heat			0
dissection and plastination of an entire body requires about 1,500 working hours and normally takes about one year to complete it aims to illustrate the complexity of the animals ' insides , and how different animals have adapted both their anatomy and their organ function to their natural habitats			1
the exhibition uses plastination , a technique developed by @entity116 anatomist dr @entity7 in 1977 for preserving biological tissue specimen			1
the process is used in anatomy to preserve bodies or body parts , by replacing water and fat with certain plastics , to create specimens that can be touched , do not smell or decay			0
plastination was originally used to preserve small specimens for medical study			0
it was only in the early 1990s that techniques were developed to plastinate whole body specimens			0
each could take up to 1,500 person - hours to prepare			1
plastination is now used at more than 40 medical and dental schools throughout the world as an adjunct to anatomical dissection			2
@entity138 went on to form the @entity139 in @entity140 , @entity141 in 1993 which made their first showing of plastinated bodies in @entity144 in 1995 , which drew more than three million visitors			1
over the next two years , @entity138 developed the @entity8 public exhibitions , showing whole bodies , donated by willing donors , plastinated in lifelike poses and dissected to show various structures and systems of human anatomy			1
more than 10,000 people have agreed to donate their bodies to @entity139 for plastination			0
past exhibitions have included a display in @entity157 , @entity158 which was mainly composed of plastinated @entity160 body parts and embryos			1
his most complex work so far is said to be the giraffe which appeared in ' @entity8 3 & @entity165 '			0
the specimen took three years to complete – 10 times longer than a human			0
the current exhibition , which is at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , was was made possible through cooperation with various veterinary programs and zoos with no animals harmed or killed for use			1
student @entity174 looks at a horse 's head , as nearly 100 anatomically dissected animals go on display at the @entity11 in @entity12 an intricate display shows a chicken 's blood vessels and veins which have been preserved using a technique called plastination but many of dr von @entity188 ' exhibitions - dubbed dr @entity186 ( dr @entity190 ) in @entity141 - have drawn criticism from religious groups			1
members of the @entity194 said that his displays of human remains is disrespectful			0
but that has n't stopped museums and venues in cities across the world hosting @entity8 , which has attracted more than 29 million visitors			2
the professor has continually courted controversy throughout his career and in 2005 in a four - part series on @entity208 called @entity209 for @entity210 , he dissected cadavers on live tv			1
he followed up in 2006 with @entity213 : @entity214			0
his laboratory later angered @entity116 @entity216 when it began to offer body parts for sale online , including plastinated ' slices ' of corpses including a human head			2
in 2011 , he announced he was dying of parkinson 's disease and has said he wants his own body displayed in the same manner as his specimens when his time comes			0
dr @entity7 at the opening of his plastinarium in @entity229 , @entity141 born in @entity230 in 1945 , @entity7 was diagnosed with a rare bleeding disorder and almost died aged six			2
aged 20 , he entered the @entity233 medical school where he began to oppose the @entity235 system under which he lived			0
attempting to flee to @entity236 in 1969 , he was imprisoned for two years			0
aged 26 , his freedom was bought by @entity141 where he completed his medical studies and entered the field of pathology			0
in 1975 , he began to experiment with the preservation of body parts using reactive polymers			0
he said : ' i wondered why the plastic was poured and then cured around the specimens rather than pushed into the cells , which would stabilise the specimens from within and literally allow you to grasp it			0
' by 1982 , @entity7 patented the plastination technique which has been adopted in laboratories across the world			0
in 1995 , he premiered @entity8 in @entity144 and the show has been seen by more than 28million people since , despite fierce opposition in some quarters			0
between 2005 - 2006 he dissected cadavers live on television a human body is on display next to a 120kg gorilla at the exhibition which offers visitors an ' anatomical safari ' past nearly one hundred anatomically dissected animals some animals , such as this shark , have been given the full - body plastinate process , while a series of ' single specimens ' offer preserved organs or even slices of animal the display aims to illustrate the complexity of the animals ' insides , and how different animals have adapted both their anatomy and their organ function to their natural habitats the exhibition uses plastination , a technique developed by @entity116 anatomist dr @entity7 in 1977 for preserving biological tissue specimen			1

the latest exhibition from dr @entity291 : @entity293 - is on display in @entity12 today
it offers a graphic ' anatomical safari ' for visitors who can see nearly one hundred anatomically dissected animals
exhibition includes an elephant which at 3.2 tons and 6metres by 3.5 metres is the largest animal ever plastinated
