‘ they just grabbed me , ’ she recalled solemnly , her head wrapped in gauze			1
‘ one grabbed this arm and the other grabbed the other arm and they just pulled me down and i was screaming and hollering			1
’ the bites exposed the bone of her limbs and skull as she screamed for help			1
‘ they grab my left leg and rip all that up then they tried to get my eye ball out			2

tragic : here @entity34 sits with her common law husband at their @entity15 , @entity16 home			2
