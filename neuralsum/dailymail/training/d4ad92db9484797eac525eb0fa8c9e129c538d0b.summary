by @entity0 last updated at 3:25 pm on 28th december 2011 although hailed for his discovery of the @entity4 in the 15th century , @entity2 ’s reputation was tainted because he was blamed for introducing syphilis to @entity6			1
however , several reports have since argued the case that the deadly disease was already widespread before @entity2 landed back in @entity10 in 1493			2
now researchers @entity11 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , from @entity15 and @entity17 ’s @entity16 , claim that all the evidence putting @entity2 and his crew in the clear is flawed			2
in the dock over syphilis : explorer @entity2 , who came from @entity23 , in present - day @entity24 @entity11 told @entity25 : ‘ there 's no really good evidence of a syphilis case before 1492 in @entity6			1
’ curable in the present day by antibiotics , syphilis used to be a debilitating and often fatal disease			2
caused by the treponema pallidum bacteria it affected the heart , brain , eyes and bones and was the scourge of every major city			1
ever since the first recorded case in @entity6 took place in 1495 - three years after @entity2 's first voyage to the @entity45 - doctors have argued over its origins			1
historians who argue that @entity2 could n’t have been source point out that rudimentary 15th century medical know - how meant that doctors would not have been able to distinguish the disease among others that had similar symptoms , so it could have been around for a long time			0
there are also skeletons from @entity6 that pre-date @entity2 ’s epic voyage and that show signs of syphilitic lesions			1
it ’s strong evidence and @entity62 admits to finding the idea of @entity2 bringing the disease back laughable at first			0
a syphilitic skull with the tell - tale indentations on the forehead ( file picture ) but then he began a closer inspection of the 54 published reports putting @entity2 in the clear			1
he found that the skeletal material was n’t irrefutable proof , by any means			0
writing in the @entity75 , his team report : ‘ we did not find a single case of @entity79 treponemal disease that has both a certain diagnosis and a secure pre-columbian date			0
‘ we also demonstrate that many of the reports use non-specific indicators to diagnose treponemal disease , do not provide adequate information about the methods used to date specimens , and do not include high - quality photographs of the lesions of interest			2
’ in the cases where the skeletons definitely were afflicted with syphilis , the researchers noted that they came from coastal areas , which would make radio - carbon dating difficult			0
this is because it ’s likely the victims ate seafood , which can contain carbon many thousands of years old from water wells			0
the team adds : ‘ solid evidence supporting an @entity79 origin for the disease remains absent			0

all 54 reports arguing he did *n't* are flawed , say *experts*
syphilis used to be the scourge of every city in @entity6
