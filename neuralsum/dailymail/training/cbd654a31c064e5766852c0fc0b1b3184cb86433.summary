by @entity0 published : 03:58 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 05:25 est , 28 august 2013 an internet advert that compared a scantily clad woman to a spicy @entity3 has been banned by watchdogs for being ' crass and degrading '			1
the ' @entity6 ' advert for @entity7 featured on the snack 's @entity9 page and showed a woman posing in red knickers and a revealing red bra			1
two other ads , including this one of a woman stripping , were cleared by the watchdog three adverts for spicy @entity3 - including a video of a woman taking her top off ( pictured ) - were investigated after 18 people complained to the @entity33 it formed part of an internet campaign by the brand featuring three sexually provocative adverts with the strapline ' peel the top off a hottie '			1
the @entity42 ( @entity33 ) launched its investigation after receiving 18 complaints that claimed the ads were offensive , sexist and degrading to women			2
some complained that it was irresponsible and harmful because it suggested it was acceptable to try and remove women 's clothing without their consent			0
the @entity33 ruled that the @entity6 ad had breached its regulatory code			0
it said its ' presentation of the woman in a sexual pose and the blatant comparison with the food product was crass and degrading and therefore likely to cause serious offence			2
' the @entity33 ruled the ad comparing women to food with strap line ' @entity64 the top off a hottie ' was offensive the watchdog acknowledged the ad was ' tongue in cheek ' , but ordered that it be removed and told @entity71 , the owner of the @entity3 brand , to avoid using offensive imagery in future campaigns			1
two other adverts that attracted criticism from members of the public were cleared , although the watchdog said viewers may find them ' distasteful '			0
one showed a man struggling to eat a spicy @entity84 chicken flavour @entity3 before fantasizing about dancing with a female passenger who eventually takes her top off followed by the strapline ' peel a top off a hottie '			1
after he finished the @entity3 he realises he has been dancing with a man			0
the @entity33 disputed viewers ' complaints that the advert was too sexually provocative or degrading , as the woman danced with the man while the woman removed her top voluntarily			2
the @entity33 cleared two of the adverts , including one in which showed a man fantasizes about a woman stripping but when he finishes his @entity3 realises he had been dancing with a man ( pictured ) a second advert on the @entity9 page , which showed cartoon versions of the pair alongside two @entity3 lids arranged to resemble a woman 's bust was judged as having a humorous tone and allowed to stay			1
the watchdog said : ' we considered that although some visitors to the @entity113 may have found the " peel the top of a hottie " to be distasteful , we considered that none of the ads condoned the removal of a woman 's clothing without her consent or suggested that such an act was likely to be acceptable			0
' according to the @entity33 , @entity71 said the campaign was ' cheeky and humorous ' in tone and that ' despite an element of light - hearted innuendo , the ads did not in any way condone or advocate that it was acceptable to remove another person 's clothing without their consent			0

@entity134 said advert ' crass and degrading ' to women
