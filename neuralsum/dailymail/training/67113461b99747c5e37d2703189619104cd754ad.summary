by @entity0 published : 15:14 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 16:55 est , 4 january 2013 an archeological team are heading to @entity2 in the hopes of unearthing dozens of @entity5 spitfires said to have been buried there at the end of the @entity7			1
over one hundred unused and unassembled aircrafts were supposedly buried in the @entity2 jungle by the @entity10 in 1945			1
the 21 - strong excavation team flying out tomorrow will include a 90 - year - old war veteran who claims to have witnessed the burial of the @entity4 after the war ended			1
exciting excavation expedition : a team leaving for @entity2 tomorrow hopes to find the up to 124 spitfire planes they believe to have been buried in boxes in the jungle at the end of @entity7 ( file photo ) some 36 planes are thought to be lying undiscovered in @entity23 - one of three potential sites in the country - with as many 124 @entity4 buried in total			1
farmer and aviation enthusiast @entity27 , from @entity30 , is spearheading the dig , having spent 17 years and thousands of pounds researching the project			2
speaking at @entity34 's @entity33 , in @entity35 , he described plans to return the @entity4 to @entity5 for restoration to allow them to be flown again			1
‘ there 's lot of rumours about why they were buried but the common theory is that they were buried after the war - in august and december 1945 - because they were surplus to requirements			1
somebody gave the order , let 's dig a hole and let 's bury them			0
' they will be restored to flying condition and hopefully they 'll be flying in about three years ’ time at air shows , and promoting @entity5 industry as well			0
’ high hopes : aircraft enthusiast @entity27 , 62 , has spent the past 17 years researching and investigating into the case of the missing spitfires and will finally head to @entity2 tomorrow the team includes @entity5 war veteran @entity62 , from @entity63 , who responded to mr @entity27 's appeal for witnesses who saw the @entity66 being buried 68 years ago			1
mr @entity62 , who is now in his early 90s , was stationed in @entity2 at the end of the @entity7 and is one of eight eye - witnesses to come forward			1
the planes are believed to be buried some 25 to 30 feet below the ground , and mr @entity27 believes they may have been protected from erosion due to a lack of oxygen underground			1
project archaeologist @entity75 said : ‘ the archaeological team are treating this like a police mystery			2
we 've got a missing person , we 've got a crime scene , and at the end we 'll hopefully have the evidence to base a case to say what actually happened at @entity23 in 1945			2
’ one of the @entity4 ( pictured : the tail fins ) being crated up in @entity2 in 1945 ready to be buried avengers re-assemble : the team hopes to be able to uncover the @entity66 in a good enough state so that they can be reassembled upon their return to @entity5 ( file photo ) online gaming site @entity93 is providing financial support for the hunt , which is hoped will unearth the first @entity4 in about two weeks			1
the contract allowing the dig to go ahead will see the @entity2 government take 50 per cent of the value of aircraft recoveredm while mr @entity27 's share will be 30 per cent and his agent 20 per cent			2
it followed a meeting between prime minister @entity106 and @entity2 president @entity107 earlier this year where @entity2 agreed to lift the trade sanctions			2
mr @entity27 helped persuaded the country 's notoriously secretive regime to allow him to search for the lost aircraft , winning their trust over several visits			0
the married father - of - three doggedly pieced together their possible location by speaking to the declining number of @entity121 veterans he said at the time : ' i ’m only a small farmer , i ’m not a multi-millionaire and it has been a struggle			0
it took me more than 15 years but i finally found them			0
' spitfires are beautiful aeroplanes and should not be rotting away in a foreign land			0
' they saved our neck in the @entity134 and they should be preserved			0
' mr @entity27 added : ‘ i think this is on the same level as the @entity137 in @entity138			0
‘ if we 're successful , i 'd like to repeat what archaeologist @entity139 said then			0
' @entity140 asked : “ can you see anything ? ” , and he replied : “ yes , wonderful things ”			0
