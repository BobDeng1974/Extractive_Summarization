by @entity0 published : 05:33 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 09:14 est , 3 march 2014 they come to leave bowls of fruit in the hopes of pleasing the gods , spend their days chanting mantras and dress in the colourful saffron robes favoured by the gods of the @entity12 pantheon			0
welcome to @entity13 , a two - day festival celebrated all over the world , although nowhere does it quite so exuberantly as @entity17 and @entity18 , the two homelands of @entity12			1
one of 12 holidays dedicated to the @entity12 god @entity22 , the bringer of death and destruction , the @entity20 marks the day of his wedding to the goddess @entity27 as well as the day he first performed his cosmic dance , the @entity30			1
from huge , colourful processions to a day - long fast , @entity57 celebrate @entity22 in scores of different ways			0
all , however , partake in the key elements of @entity70 : making offerings of golden apple leaves to @entity22 , fasting for a full 24 hours and by taking part in the jagarana - a night - long vigil held on the eve of the festival			0
many worshippers also choose to show their respect for @entity22 by chanting ' @entity79 ' , a sacred @entity81 mantra dedicated to the deity			2
others show their respect for the god by wearing his favourite colour , saffron yellow , or by dressing up as the god himself , his wife @entity27 or in some cases , both			1
watch out ! a worshipper dressed as a demon lies on a ( pretend ) funeral pyre during the @entity96 celebrations in the @entity17 city of @entity35 parade : three colourfully dressed little girls sit on a huge cut out portrait of an elephant head as they process through the streets of @entity35 @entity104 ! a worshipper dressed as a demon lies shrouded in smoke from a fake funeral pyre during the @entity96 celebrations in @entity35 deity : a man dressed as the @entity12 god @entity22 offers blessings to the crowd during the @entity115 through the streets of @entity35 do n't drop it ! ' @entity22 ' shows off his courage with the help of a python , watched by members of the huge crowds that line the streets for @entity70 preparation : a man is helped into his costume which is 50 per cent @entity22 and 50 per cent his wife , the goddess @entity27 while many ordinary @entity17 and @entity18 men and women get involved in proceedings , celebrations are led by the @entity133 men who have dedicated their lives to serving the @entity12 pantheon			1
the most colourfully garbed of all the participants , some choose to paint sacred scenes and symbols on their faces , while others smoke cannabis to help them achieve a meditative frame of mind			0
some , the @entity145 , carry human bones and skulls ; a sign of their life 's work on overcoming taboos , whether by meditating over corpses or even , occasionally , eating human flesh			0
regardless of what they wear - or the bones they carry - @entity155 is one day when @entity57 of all types come together in the hopes that lord @entity22 keeps death and destruction at bay for at least another year			1
respectful : this @entity48 ( holy man ) has chosen to wear a tunic and scarf in saffron yellow - the colour loved most by @entity22 with a history that stretches back almost 3000 years and links with @entity173 and @entity174 as well as @entity175 , @entity17 's @entity170 is one of the holiest cities in the world			1
now a modern metropolis with an estimated 1.2 million inhabitants , the @entity180 city remains an important centre for pilgrims and is the @entity186 equivalent of @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189			0
unlike the other three however , @entity170 , thought by @entity57 to have been founded by the deity @entity22 , is home to a set of hermits known as @entity48 who live and pray on the ghats ( steps ) that line the banks of the @entity197			2
they share their space with pilgrims who flock to the city to cleanse themselves of sin in the river 's waters or even , in the case of the old or terminally ill , to await their deaths			0
like the other six holy @entity12 cities , expiring while in @entity170 is considered an auspicious because it offers moksha - a lasting release from the cycle of birth and death			2
others visit to see the stunning architectural legacy left by the @entity216 dynasty , who spent centuries beautifying the city in honour of its founder , @entity22 , and the imposing @entity223 ; a @entity225 - built edifice that overlooks the city from the other side of the @entity197			0
singing : @entity230 also involves the chanting of mantras , most of which is done by @entity234 men like this pair drugs : many @entity48 , such as this one photographed in the courtyard of @entity18 's @entity238 , use cannabis to help them get into the right frame of mind celebration : a pair of @entity234 men dressed in @entity22 's favourite saffron yellow celebrate in the @entity238 in @entity18 capital , @entity246 beautiful : the colourful festival takes place in february or early march and along with processions , involves a day - long fast and a night - long vigil in honour of the god wisdom : the @entity48 or holy men are on hand throughout the celebrations to offer guidance to the crowd and will pray alongside them honour : along with painting their faces with representations of sacred images or symbols , many @entity48 dye their beards with saffron in honour of the gods			1
