by @entity0 published : 10:50 est , 26 september 2012 updated : 12:47 est , 26 september 2012 prince @entity1 dubbed it ' bloody daft ' and critics say that the idea of debutantes presenting themselves to the aristocracy is outdated and elitist , but for certain sections of @entity11 society the @entity8 's ball is the ultimate summer event			2
dubbed the ' crowning event of the @entity14 ' the guest list is hand - picked with care : only young women from the richest families are invited to the september ball where , after months of careful preparation and spending over £ 2500 on each ticket , the young debutantes are able to show off their skills in poise and elegance			1
in the past debutante balls were seen as a rite of passage for the young women of the upper classes , an opportunity to introduce themselves to society and seek out a potential suitor , but for today 's debutantes the season is seen as an opportunity to wear a designer gown , party their way around @entity39 , and do a little something for charity			0
debutantes @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , and @entity47 ( @entity48 ) attend a dress - fitting for @entity8 's ball in central @entity50 queen @entity8 's @entity49 was introduced by @entity52 in 1780 as a way to celebrate his wife ’s birthday , and a huge cake was one of the highlights			1
up until 1958 , young debutantes used to be presented to the @entity51 at @entity60 , until prince @entity1 pointed out that it was ‘ bloody daft ’			0
today the ' daft ' debutantes , all aged between 17 and 20 , follow the traditional @entity8 's cake in to the ballroom where the girls perform special curtsies to the nine - tier - high gateaux before being judged on their posture , elegance and pace by the room			1
the event involves meetings with aristocracy , etiquette classes , and charity fund - raising , and the ' deb of the year ' is chosen according to ' who has worked hardest ’ during fund - raising activities throughout the season and shown the most enthusiasm ( she is usually the prettiest too , although that is not an official judging requirement )			0
the debutantes , all hand - picked girls from rich backgrounds , rehearse their entrance to the ball dressed in couture gowns debutante @entity91 is told off for walking too fast by former debutante @entity92 as she rehearses			1
the girls make a grand entrance walking in one by one and are judged on their posture , elegance and pace @entity96 was named @entity97 at @entity8 's ball on september 14 , 2012 the young women spend months preparing for their dramatic entrance in to the ballroom and go to several dress fittings to make sure their couture gowns cling perfectly			2
prior to the event older debutantes are on hand to guide and critique the girls on their dress , dancing and pace around the ballroom and on the day an army of professional hair and make - up artists are on hand to make sure that the girls are glowing , setting off perfectly coiffed up ' dos with diamond studded tiaras and precious jewellery			0
and on the night , once the deb of the year award has been handed out - this year @entity96 won the accolade - the girls are free to dance the night away with their families , friends and the handsome male guests , dubbed the ' @entity127 ' delights '			0

ms @entity43 said : ' a lot of my friends went over to @entity168 and @entity169 and did something worthwhile , and i wanted to have the chance to give something back a little bit , so i was really interested in the charity side of it			0
