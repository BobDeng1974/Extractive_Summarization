by @entity0 published : 13:41 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 05:32 est , 1 november 2013 a toy lover has spent a decade recreating his favourite @entity3 characters in @entity5 - and results are impressive			1
@entity7 , also known as @entity8 , has painstakingly created a @entity3 series that could n't be further away from @entity5 's simple trademark look			1
the @entity3 fan from @entity12 has constructed , among others , an incredible replica of @entity8 complete with the @entity8 truck			1
the premise behind the design was that an individual toy 's parts can be moved to change it from a vehicle , a device , or an animal , to a robot action figure			2
the toys were promoted through a comic book by @entity31 and an animated series			2
the animated series was outlived by the comic , but it was the series that truly captured the imagination of children throughout the world			2
a number of @entity3 science fiction action films were created by @entity39 in 2007 , 2009 and 2011			2
over the past decade , he has made a number of different versions of @entity8 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			1
mr @entity7 is a self - confessed perfectionist and each version has improved design and functionality			1
he claims he ’s always on a quest for the right technique in order to get every transformation , ' every little feature and detail of every character right			0
’ when working on hound he said he had to wait years until the colours were available in order to finish the build to his high standards			1
even now he claims that he can hear the figures calling ‘ improve me , improve me again , now ! ! ’ mr @entity7 ’ creations can all be found on his @entity3 site , @entity8			1
the @entity5 artist has also built a number of other creations out of @entity5 , including a bat mobile , a @entity70 @entity69 cap , and a custom @entity72 2			2

' to get the build right is ( was / will be / has ever been ) always a quest for the right technique			0
