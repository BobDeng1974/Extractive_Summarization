@entity0 lauded his players for stretching their lead at the top of the @entity4 with victory at @entity6 – then hit out at the state of pitches in @entity9			1
a @entity11 strike and @entity13 ’s penalty were enough to see off a spirited challenge by the bottom side as @entity16 moved eight points clear of @entity18			1
but although pleased with the way his side stayed patient to win , @entity0 felt their cause was n’t helped by the state of the @entity26 surface			1
and he believes @entity9 football will struggle to develop top players if there is n’t a drastic improvement in our pitches			1
@entity16 manager @entity0 was impressed with his side 's performance against @entity6 on friday night ‘ it was a tough game , @entity6 were well organised and played very deep , ’ he said			1
‘ they fought really hard and it was difficult to break them down			0
we had to be patient			0
the pitch was better than some others we ’ve played on			0
but the pitches in @entity9 are terrible			1
‘ if you want to develop players and get passing football , it ’s difficult when the ball is bouncing all the time			2
it ’s much easier for the other teams to just sit behind the ball and try to break down our play			2
‘ it ’s better to play on an artificial surface than this			1
if they are watering artificial pitches and they are of the best quality , it ’s totally different and much closer to @entity60 standards			1
@entity11 slides on his knees to celebrate scoring @entity16 's opening goal against @entity6 ‘ if we are going to develop good young players , you need a good surface to play and train on			1
if not , you get fighters			0
if you want skills and technique , play on better surfaces			2
‘ they are much better in @entity71			0
sixty per cent are artificial and the grass pitches are better as well because they do n’t train there and there are n’t other teams playing on them			1
and we play in the summer			2
that ’s the biggest thing			0
the pitch here might not look so bad but try to play on it			2
’ tv pictures showed @entity81 eating a chocolate biscuit while sitting on the bench			0
but @entity0 , a strong advocate of fitness and conditioning , laughed it off			1
‘ i think it was a carbo biscuit which is totally different ! i ’ll have to check his weight tomorrow			0
’ @entity16 midfielder @entity13 slots home from the penalty spot to secure his side 's 2 - 0 victory @entity94 believes there ’s no stopping @entity16 as they close in on a treble			1
‘ it looks great for us now , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t think we ’re unbeatable but there is a huge confidence in the team			0
‘ we are starting to look fitter and have much more of the ball because we ’re playing with a higher tempo			0
that ’s the way the manager wants us to play			0
i said in the beginning when people were asking questions i was confident he would be a great and it ’s starting to look that way			0
’ @entity112 boss @entity111 felt there were positives in defeat but was n’t happy about the handball awarded against @entity117 for @entity16 ’s penalty			2
‘ was it ball to hand or hand to ball ? if they ’re going to give penalties for things like that they need to give all of them in every single game			0
’ @entity0 berated the state of pitches in @entity9 and claimed it would be better to play on artificial surfaces			1

@entity16 beat @entity6 2 - 0 to move eight points clear at the top of the league
@entity0 *praised* his players for their patience in waiting for the win
although pleased , he said the pitches in @entity9 are ' terrible '
@entity0 believes it would be better to play on artificial pitches
