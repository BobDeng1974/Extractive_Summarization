will @entity0 has n't been able to keep his feet firmly in one place since the age of 18			1
the 26 - year - old @entity5 backpacker has only once tried to conform to a regular nine - to - five desk job at a travel agency - an endeavour that failed within six months			1
instead , mr @entity0 has made a career out of travelling the globe as @entity11 , recording his adventures in his blog , making money through any random odd job he can find in foreign lands and spending only $ 100 each week on all of his expenses			1
will @entity0 has made a career out of travelling the globe as @entity11 while spending only us $ 100 a week ' when i first started travelling seven years ago i really did n't have any money whatsoever , so i became a bit of a whizz at hitching , couch surfing and dumpster - diving , ' he said ' @entity26 is definitely one of the cheapest countries i have ever been to			1
you can fill up a car for under 2 cents and get 12 beers for a dollar ! ' for just $ 100 mr @entity0 received a stack of money totalling over 1000 bills ' when i first started travelling seven years ago i really did n't have any money whatsoever , so i became a bit of a whizz at hitching , couch surfing and dumpster - diving			1
all of this helped me save money and spend my budget on what really mattered - having a good time , ' mr @entity0 told @entity45			1
' now i tend to purposefully pick extremely cheap countries such as @entity47 , @entity26 or @entity48 in order to help stretch my money as far a possible			2
' @entity26 is definitely one of the cheapest countries i have ever been to			0
you can fill up a car for under 2 cents and get 12 beers for a dollar ! ' sometimes , i pick up casual work on the road			0
i 've herded goats in the @entity58 , run beer - pong tables in @entity60 and done more than my fair share of flyering in @entity48			1
in general , i 'm very good at budgeting and i am now making enough money from my travel writing to help fund my lifestyle			0
pictured laying a water pipe , the 26 - year - old picks up odd jobs wherever he travels ' i 've herded goats in the @entity58 , run beer - pong tables in @entity60 and done more than my fair share of flyering in @entity48 '			1
pictured : mr @entity0 at the highest mountina pass in the world at @entity73 , central @entity47 ' i 've shared smokes with wandering holy men in @entity76 ( pictured ) and drank tea with rebels in @entity79 , ' he said ' i 'm still very proud to be @entity5 , but ultimately i 'm not sure if i will end up in the @entity5 or not because i can afford a much better standard of living whilst travelling and eventually i hope to open a string of hostels			2
' the keen traveller , who is currently making his way through the @entity86 , has visited nearly 50 countries over the last seven years and aims to reach 100 by the time he turns 30			1
' i spent over a year travelling in @entity76 before heading to @entity47 and then onwards to @entity79 and the rest of the classic banana pancake trail			0
i 've hitched all over @entity91 and even to @entity92 and more recently i 've been spending time in @entity26 and @entity93 , ' mr @entity0 said			1
but his adventures have left him with a scar or two and lead him into plenty of disastrous situations			2
mr @entity0 said he has been robbed on three separate occasions , once at knife point , crashed motorbikes , had to be evacuated from a jungle in @entity102 after developing a serious leg infection that left permanent damage to his limb and was strip - searched at gun point while crossing into @entity107 from @entity108			1
in @entity109 , he hitched a ride from a @entity111 ( pictured ) who let him spend a week living in his cave , cooking on the fire and helping to herd his goats while @entity109 's star - filled desert sky left him in awe each night @entity117 riding in @entity109 : ' get on with it , just go and do n't look back : if you spend your whole life waiting for the perfect time , the perfect companion or the perfect destination to go travelling then you may never end up going , ' mr @entity0 says he admitted that he found himself well and truly out of money on a number of occasions , often leading him to search for work at a bar for a few days or a farm in exchange for food and board @entity76 tug of war : ' after a year in @entity76 , i was totally skint and ended up couchsurfing with an elephant handler for a couple of weeks whilst i figured out my next move ' ' to this day , i do not know why i was singled out , but i was separated from everybody else in the queue and taken into a @entity139 building complete with blast doors , ' he recounted			1
get on with it , just go and do n't look back : if you spend your whole life waiting for the perfect time , the perfect companion or the perfect destination to go travelling then you may never end up going			0
make sure you have the right gear : if you 're planning on hitching , take a tent - who knows where you may end up at night			2
one of the most useful pieces of equipment that i take absolutely everywhere is my head torch - it 's gotten me out of a tight spot on more than one occasion			0
try not to worry too much : if you 're travelling for the first time and nervous about being lonely , us vagabonds are a friendly bunch and all you need to do is check in to a hostel dorm in order to make plenty of friends			1
via @entity0 ' i was instructed through a loud speaker to remove all of my clothes			2
i stripped down to my boxers and was then made to take them off as well by two guards who came in with assault rifles			0
' luckily they released me without anything else happening , but i still have no idea why i was made to take off all my clothes			0
a practical joke maybe ? ' he has also found himself in the sticky situation of well and truly running out of money on a number of occasions , often leading him to search for work at a bar for a few days or a farm in exchange for food and board			0
' after a year in @entity76 , i was totally skint and ended up couchsurfing with an elephant handler for a couple of weeks whilst i figured out my next move			0
' in the end , i sold a load of my stuff on @entity192 and my mum had to deal with posting stuff out all over the @entity5 for me			0
luckily i had a couple of hundred action figures from my school - days and selling them helped me keep travelling for another year			0
however the trips have also left him with invaluable experiences that he 'll never forget , including hitching a ride from a @entity203 who let him spend a week living in his cave , cooking on the fire and helping to herd his goats while @entity109 's star - filled desert sky left him in awe each night			1

' next week i plan to meet the fascinating @entity234 - a 95 year old @entity236 tattoo artist who is the last person left alive that still practises @entity239 tribal tattooing			2
she has agreed to tattoo me			0
' for his next lengthy trip , planned for march next year , mr @entity0 said he will travel to @entity241 without boarding a single flight			2
' i will catch trains as far as @entity244 before crossing into @entity245 , up into @entity246 and @entity247 and then across @entity248 and down through @entity249 and @entity250 , ' he said			0
' once i hit @entity251 , i plan on hitching rides on sailing boats across @entity254 and onwards to @entity255 ; finally , i will end my trip in @entity241			0
