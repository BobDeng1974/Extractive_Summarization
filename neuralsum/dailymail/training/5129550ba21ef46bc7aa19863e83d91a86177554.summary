standing tall : @entity0 , 12 , broke her back in may but is now fully recovered a paralysed girl who broke her back when she fell nearly 20ft from a tree has astounded doctors with her recovery – thanks to titanium rods screwed into her spine			1
@entity0 ’s parents feared she would never walk again after the accident at a @entity13 camp			1
the fall shattered a bone in her back and left another pressing against her spine			1
the injury was so serious that her spine would have collapsed if she had tried to stand up			0
@entity0 underwent a remarkable 90 - minute procedure which is similar to one routinely offered to patients with scoliosis – an abnormal curvature of the back			1
princess @entity24 suffered from scoliosis and had surgery lasting eight hours to correct it in 2002			1
@entity0 and @entity24 , who were both treated at the @entity28 ( @entity29 ) in @entity30 , ‘ swapped notes ’ when the 12 - year - old schoolgirl was introduced to the princess at a charity dinner six weeks after her operation			1
@entity24 is patron of an @entity29 appeal to raise £ 15 million to redevelop its site			1
@entity0 ’s mother @entity36 , 45 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , reveals : ‘ it was amazing meeting @entity24 , who told us all about her operation			1
@entity0 has been so brave through everything			2
' we had feared the worst , so when we saw her walk again it was such an emotional moment			0
’ @entity0 ’s astonishing recovery gives hope to the 1,000 @entity47 a year paralysed by spinal cord injuries			2
the spinal column is made up of vertebrae , and it relays messages from the brain around the body			0
people can end up paralysed if the spinal cord is crushed and a patient does n’t receive surgery promptly – for example if they ’re left trapped for hours after an accident			0
fortunately , @entity0 was in the operating theatre within hours of her fall in may			2
when she fell , she was acting as ‘ lookout ’ for her friends who were enjoying a water fight below her			0
the branch she was sitting on snapped suddenly , sending @entity0 hurtling to the ground , and she landed on her back			1
@entity36 and her husband @entity68 , 43 , a paramedic for the @entity69 , rushed to the @entity13 camp , which was just minutes from their home			0
@entity36 says : ‘ @entity0 was talking but complaining that her legs felt funny – she was getting shocks through her feet and her nerve endings felt on fire			2
‘ @entity68 did a quick assessment , then called an ambulance			0
i just keep telling myself , “ as long as she ’s alive			0
” ’ royal friend : @entity0 met @entity24 , who underwent the same type of surgery to treat scoliosis in 2002 , at a charity dinner six weeks after her operation the youngster was taken to a local hospital before being referred to the @entity29 for specialist treatment			1
an mri and ct scan confirmed that she had fractured one of the 12 vertebrae that make up the spine in the upper back and provide structure for the rib cage			1
a section of bone was also pressing on the part of the spinal cord responsible for muscle and bladder control			0
‘ @entity0 is incredibly lucky , ’ says @entity104 , a consultant spinal surgeon at the @entity29			2
‘ she broke the oval segment of bone that surrounds the spinal cord			0
it ’s a bit like squashing a grape – bits fly out everywhere and if you tried to stand , your spine would collapse			0
‘ patients who come in like this can be paralysed straight away or develop paralysis afterwards			0
' @entity0 had only partial paralysis but there was still a risk that she could deteriorate			2
’ she was given a general anaesthetic , then very carefully rolled on to her front , a manoeuvre that involved six people to ensure no further damage to her spine			0
straight up : the x-ray image shows the titanium rods which were screwed into @entity0 's spine where they will remain for the rest of her life medics then rigged @entity0 up to a special machine which checks that the nerves in the spinal cord are functioning normally during surgery			1
next , an incision was made down the middle of her back , before eight 12in titanium screws were positioned along the spine in pairs – one on each side – including where the bone was fractured			1
they were screwed into the bone to support and strengthen the vertebrae			0
mr @entity104 also inserted two 3.5in titanium rods vertically down either side of @entity0 ’s spine			1
a screw was used to secure those rods in place at each point along the spine – doctors tightened them using a special wrench to correct the fracture			1
the surgical team also took away a small portion of bone from the spine to reduce pressure on @entity0 ’s back			1
the schoolgirl was walking the day after the operation with the help of a physiotherapist , and discharged a week after surgery			0
the rods and screws will remain in her back for life and she relies on friends to carry her school bag , but otherwise she has made a full recovery			2
to thank doctors , her family are now raising funds for the @entity29			0
her father @entity68 said : ‘ we never dreamed @entity0 would make a full recovery			2
one day she will walk down the church aisle or run in the school sports day			0

@entity0 , 12 , broke her back after falling from a tree in may
