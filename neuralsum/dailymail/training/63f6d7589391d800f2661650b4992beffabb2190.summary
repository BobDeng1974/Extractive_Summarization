a space - age chain - mail structure stands tall in @entity1 , @entity3 's rough - and - ready arts quarter			2
the statuesque @entity4 makes its own mark on a city skyline which boasts the @entity7 , the @entity8 , the @entity9 and the @entity11 mountain with its faded carousels			2
it opened in september 2008 , taking up a site on @entity1 that was once a housing estate			1
fast forward six years , and this ultra-modern four - star retreat attracts a cool crowd in what is increasingly the alternative centre of the city			2
striking : interior designer @entity19 was the man responsible for creating the hotel 's chic @entity21 area renowned interior designer @entity23 was the man responsible for creating an interior so flash that - the receptionist says - people often wonder if they have walked into a nightclub			1
so it is fitting that , in the summer , when the city 's music festivals @entity31 and @entity32 come to town , this is where all the djs want to stay			1
but do n't let that put you off			2
this is not one of those image - obsessed hotels where the dolled - up flaunt their money and their flesh ( although you might gain that impression if the glamourous rooftop pool is your first port of call )			1
everyone fits in , and staff treat every guest with grace			0
drinks at dusk : the panoramic terrace bar affords magnificent widescreen views of @entity3 modern comforts : the 182 rooms have iphone docking stations , nespresso coffee makers and fabulous views the @entity62 - the dramatic pink and purple reception which you encounter as you walk into the hotel - is a multifunctional space , cafe by day ; cocktail and tapas bar by night			1
the tapas , incidentally , is glorious stuff - the very idea of small sharing plates taken to dizzy heights by beautifully sculpted ( and tasty ) patatas bravas and manchego lollipops			0
meanwhile , inside the rooms , it is all about ergonomics			0
each of the 182 rooms is like a futuristic pod , with @entity85 docking stations , motorised curtains , @entity88 cofffee makers and enormous fluffy beds			0
a flair for design : rooms at the hotel look as good on the inside as the view is impressive on the outside the rooms have large , wide windows , sound - proofed doors and what the hotel calls an ' integrated bathroom ' - which , simply put , means it is best if you are travelling with someone you know well			1
a glass panel in the shower pod leaves very little to the imagination - as my partner found out the hard way , when room service arrived unexpectedly			0
when you leave the hotel , you have a decision to make			1
one direction takes you towards a host of cafes , bars and galleries ; the other leads to the city 's red light district			0
unless you are interested in that kind of ' entertainment ' , it is advisable to double check with the hotel staff about the best way to go			1
find the right path , and you will be spoiled for choice			0
the @entity1 area is at the heart of the city , five minutes from the @entity136 - where boutique shops tempt on every street			1
the hotel is also a short distance from the @entity141 - @entity3 's ( rather tacky ) main avenue - as well as the @entity144 and @entity145 metro stations , which provide access to the rest of the metropolis			1
space - age : the hotel stands tall in @entity1 , @entity3 's rough - and - ready ( but increasingly chic ) arts quarter the surrounding streets bulge with achingly cool bookshops and trinket stores			2
and the nearby @entity156 cafe serves up delicious gazpacho in a hip post-industrial setting			0
the main attraction is the 360 - degree view from the hotel 's terrace bar - best accompanied by a cocktail or a glass of cava			1
the uninhibited can also fling off their outerwear for a splash in the pool			2
it is perhaps worth noting that , while anyone is welcome at @entity4 , it is not a place for the aurally sensitive			0
the night air is hung with neighbourhood noises of all varieties , from revellers making merry to dogs yapping and horns beeping			0
but if you have been partying yourself , you will find , once your head hits pillow , that you do n't notice			0
double rooms at the @entity185 ( @entity186 17 - 21 ; 0034 9 3320 1490 ; www.barceloraval.com ) start at € 110 ( £ 92 ) per room per night			1
prices based on two people sharing , on a bed - and - breakfast basis .			0

@entity185 has a panoramic rooftop terrace with *swimming* pool
site was once a housing estate , but is now at the heart of *gentrified* @entity186
hotel is where djs stay during music festivals like @entity31 and @entity32
