a former party - lover has given up cocktails , cigarettes and burlesque dancing and converted to @entity4 after falling for a @entity6 man nine years her junior			1
mother - of - three @entity8 , 37 , from @entity9 , overhauled her lifestyle after a trip to @entity12 in january where she met fiance , @entity13 , 28			1
in her days of burlesque dancing , she would parade around in nothing but knickers and nipple tassels			1
@entity8 , left , now @entity19 , has changed her ways as well her her name after converting to @entity4 , right ashamed : the mother - of - three now regrets pictures like this from her days as a burlesque dancer but since converting , she now covers up in a hijab and says she is ashamed she was once such an exhibitionist			1
she 's also changed her name by deed poll to @entity19			1
she said : ' before i enjoyed weekly burlesque classes			2
i would strip down to silky corsets and do sexy dances			2
now i 'm so ashamed of my past , i can barely look at old photos			1
i feel like i 've been reborn			2
' @entity19 , who has three children aged six , 16 , and 18 , met her fiance , @entity36 , following the breakdown of her first marriage and said it was love at first sight			1
she explained : ' my eight - year marriage broke down in 2013 around the time i decided to study tourism at college			1
' as part of the course last january , she travelled to the @entity12 , @entity48 , where she met @entity36			2
' he was a teacher and nine years younger than me but it was love at first sight , ' @entity19 said			1
' he was so intelligent and kind			2
on the last day of the trip in march he told me he loved me			2
' as i left the airport i cried and cried for three hours straight			0
' party animal : @entity19 used to love going out drinking before converting to @entity4 changed her life : now she 's happier and healthier after meeting @entity36 , right , who proposed in march back home , @entity19 , then still @entity8 , spoke to @entity36 on the phone every night and he proposed weeks later			1
she used to be a @entity60 but after listening to @entity36 talk about his religion , she decided to research it on the internet and ' immediately felt a connection '			1
' it 's about peace , empathy , love and kindness , all things i believe in			1
i realised i needed to become a @entity6			1
' she converted in a special ceremony in june and changed her name to one that 's traditionally @entity6			1
she has not asked her children to convert , leaving them to make their own decisions on whether they want to follow a path of religion			1
she also began observing @entity81 , explaining : ' it 's a month - long period of prayer , fasting , charity - giving and self accountability for @entity6			1
it was difficult but incredibly fulfilling			0
romantic thoughts are forbidden during @entity81 , so i banned myself from talking to @entity36 in daylight hours because i got too turned on by his voice			0
' it 's a far cry from her former hedonistic lifestyle			1
as a young woman , she had a weakness for cigarettes and alcohol and was often promiscuous			2
she said : ' before becoming a mum i 'd think nothing about bringing a man home after a night out			0
normally it was alcohol - induced but i 'd never do it now			1
long distance love : the couple will initially live apart as @entity36 works as a teacher in @entity12 and @entity19 does n't want to pull her youngest son out of school in the @entity110 ' i used to smoke 40 - a - day too			1
i was like a chimney and nearly always had a cigarette in my hand			0
i ca n't imagine smoking now , ruining my body			0
' she added : ' i used to get through at least a bottle of gin a week too			0
i was a huge @entity119 fan and would relax with a few in the evenings			0
that was just a normal week			0
' if i went out with the girls , i 'd drink more			0
i loved cocktails and would work my way through the menus in bars			0
' the next morning i 'd feel terrible and would waste the day feeling sorry for myself			0
when i think of how i behaved , i 'm so ashamed			2
' she 's also now given up her hobby of burlesque dancing , which she started in 2012 after signing up for classes at a local dance studio			1
' i wanted to improve my body confidence			0
i would perform routines , starting off fully dressed and ending up in just silky pants and nipple tassels , ' she explained			1
' i 'd never dream of doing it now			0
' looking at pictures of me in a pink silk basque i see it is very un-islamic			0
@entity4 believes a woman 's body is just for her husband			2
' mocked : not everyone has been supportive of @entity19 's decision to chance religion the way she eats and dresses on a daily basis has changed dramatically too			1
' i travel ten miles to ensure i only buy @entity150 meat from a specialist butcher			0
i used to joke " do n't wake me up in the morning unless bringing me a bacon butty and coffee " â€“ i 'd never say that now			0
' giving up bacon has been the hardest thing but @entity150 prohibits it			0
' i always cover my legs as requested to by @entity4			0
i found the headscarf quite restrictive at first			0
but now i wear it tighter because i want to			0
' @entity19 said @entity36 was ' heartbroken ' when she told him about her past but she said : ' he knows how committed i am now and believes i 've changed			1
' @entity36 is still living in @entity12 and the couple will continue to have a long distance relationship after they marry because @entity19 does not want to disrupt her youngest son 's education			1
given up alcohol : the mother used to get through at least a bottle of gin a week ' after the wedding we will live apart			1
because of the age of my youngest son , i wo n't take him out of school , so i ca n't leave the @entity110 , ' she said			0
@entity19 said she 's never been happier since meeting @entity36 and changing her religion but the decision has cost her a number of friends			1
she is often mocked or abused when she goes out in public wearing a hijab			2
she said : ' some friends do n't want to know me anymore and others are refusing to call me by my new name			0
' in the street one person asked why i was n't wearing a letterbox , meaning a burkha			2
i 've heard sniggering in the playground when i 've picked my son up from school and laughed at in @entity192 by teenage girls			0
@entity19 said friends who knew her as @entity8 refuse to call her by her new name and she 's been laughed at for wearing a hijab but she 's never been happier ' people i know locally are pulling coats over their head and running round with them , shouting , " i 'm @entity19 "			1
i 've also been called a terrorist by strangers and even former friends			0
' but she said for all the friendships she has lost , she has also gained new ones			0
' the @entity6 community is very welcoming			2
i 've been invited into their homes and made to feel more welcome by them then i ever was as a methodist			0
' i 've never been happier or healthier than now			0
and that 's all thanks to meeting @entity36			2
