a contest to turn ' nuisance ' grey squirrels into burgers had a cold reception from animal activists - who accused it of being a smear campaign against the so - called ' chicken of the trees '			1
the cook - off in the @entity11 , where the animals are accused of damaging trees , attracted wide publicity in its search for the tastiest squirrel snack			1
volunteers cooked up quarter - pounders using three minced carcasses each , and one triumphed with a ' cajun melt ' surprise - complete with a mozzarella and chutney topping			1
but they were criticised by vegetarian groups who said grey squirrels were being unfairly maligned , while the @entity27 issued a warning over how the animals were caught			1
tasty : it took at least three grey squirrels to make each quarter - pounder at a contest yesterday in the @entity11 , prompting complaints by animal rights activists who said it unfairly maligned the little - loved species popular : the contest was hosted as part of the @entity38 ( pictured ) the contest was held at the @entity38 yesterday near @entity39 , @entity40 , in a bid to get the animal on @entity44 menus			1
dozens of would - be chefs submitted a recipe to the @entity48 , and four finalists served up their version of the dish			1
each contestant was handed three ' locally - sourced ' squirrel carcasses and added their own flavours to make a quarter pounder			1
introduced to @entity57 in the 19th century , there are now around 100,000 grey squirrels in the @entity11 - a population the @entity60 claims is ' huge ' and ' extremely destructive '			1
although the agency does not cull the animals , a spokesman said : ' @entity65 squirrels do cause considerable damage to the trees through extensive bark stripping			1
' trio of carcasses : at least 12 squirrels were killed , skinned and gutted for the family event ( file photo ) hotly - tipped : a poster for the event yesterday promised prizes including a £ 55 cookery school voucher @entity78 , one of the event 's organisers , said : ' it is here in the @entity83 and we should be using it - they are a nuisance at the end of the day			1
' but the @entity91 - based charity vegetarians ’ @entity89 said the ‘ victimisation of grey squirrels ’ was ‘ totally misguided ’			2
@entity94 : this image was one of those used to advertise the squirrel burger cooking contest last week spokesman @entity99 added : ' this smear campaign against the grey squirrel reeks of both cruelty and irony			1
red squirrels themselves have previously been tarred as pests and killed in huge numbers			0
' favouring and massacring different species of wildlife continues to be a brutal fashion which can not carry on			0
' and @entity111 attacked the ' desperate - for - attention festival organisers ' who were ' swimming against the tide '			2
' our shops are brimming with healthy and delicious grains , pasta , beans , rice , nuts , fruits , almond milks and soya puddings , ' a spokesman added			0
' more and more brits are realising that these are not only far kinder choices but also far more nourishing than the dead bodies of squirrels , ponies or any other animal for that matter			0
' the @entity27 also raised concerns over how the animals were found			1
a spokesman said : ' we would hope that these particular squirrels had been killed humanely			0
' we would also be concerned about ordinary members of the public possibly trying to capture and / or kill grey squirrels and would not advocate this			0
' @entity142 defended the event , insisting it was fair to eat animals that roam in the woods			2
the @entity60 said the grey squirrel population in the area is ' huge ' and ' destructive ' ( file photo ) ready for lunch ? nicknamed the ' chicken of the trees ' , squirrel also tastes a little like rabbit ( file photo ) ms @entity78 said : ' it is no different to going out and having rabbit			1
it is also kind of an educational thing			0
it shows that it is a good food source here in the @entity83			0
by @entity161 , of the @entity163 - starred @entity162 in the @entity164 ' i think people seeing it [ at the competition ] were fascinated and curious			0
we had a lot of positive reaction			0
we have n't come across any [ negative comments ] as it happens			0
' nicknamed the ' chicken of the trees ' , squirrel meat is gamey and mostly tastes like a cross between chicken and rabbit			2
the first prize in yesterday 's contest was won by @entity182 , who won a £ 55 cookery school voucher for her ' cajun melt ' burger seasoned with jerk spices and topped with melted mozzarella and chutney			2
the runner - up was @entity190 who called her creation ' chicken of the tree surprise ' - a garlic and herb burger with melted @entity198 cheese in the centre			2
the @entity11 is already at the centre of animal rights campaigns because it is the focus of @entity57 's largest wild boar cull			2
the cull - which is taking place all winter and could claim as many as 500 animals , say activists - is set to be sabotaged by up to 30 locals who will inform each other whenever government - approved marksmen appear			2
the ancient forest is also the focus of the government 's highly controversial badger cull , which campaigners have accused of doing more harm than good			0
@entity219 , a catering lecturer at @entity220 and one of the judges , said the grey squirrel was ' obviously a nuisance within the @entity11 and it does a lot of damage and there ’s nothing wrong with eating it			1
' he added : ' it is a creature with a fluffy tail and some people would take offence at its use for food but to my mind it ’s just the same as a wild rabbit , which is perfectly acceptable			0
' they are a pest , they are in abundance and there is a food source to be had there			0
and i think it might make a nice cheeseburger			0
