by @entity0 published : 15:31 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 15:31 est , 14 november 2012 unimpressed : telecom minister @entity1 this was a bridge too far for a cash - strapped @entity5 government			1
in an apparent bid to bridge the fiscal deficit , it was banking on raising over rs 40,000 crore from the @entity10 spectrum auction			1
but the plan failed abysmally as telecom companies - bristling with anger over an exorbitantly high reserve price of rs 13,850 crore for all 22 circles set at the auction - decided to stay away			1
what the government got was a mere rs 9,407 crore			1
worse , the lucrative @entity20 and @entity21 circles went begging and found no takers			2
@entity23 and @entity24 had no bidders either			1
in fact , none bid for an all - @entity5 licence			1
the end result was that the ambitious plans to curtail the ballooning budget deficit had come a cropper and the government had only itself to blame			2
the telecom industry drew a clear link between the reserve price and the poor response			1
" first and foremost among the many causes , is the recognition that an artificially - high reserve price that bore no congruence to market realities was the key reason for the failure , " said @entity38 ( @entity38 ) 's director general @entity39			1
telecom minister @entity1 appeared to have read the reason for the @entity10 auction fizzle			0
he said the government may put the circles on auction again and possibly rework the auction reserve prices			1
" we would like to auction unsold spectrum by march next year			0
the government will take a call on lowering auction the price of @entity20 and @entity21 , " @entity1 said on wednesday			2
a top official said the department of telecommunications ( @entity62 ) would ask @entity63 ( @entity63 ) to look into the reserve price for the @entity10 licence			1
for the record , this is almost seven times more than what telcos paid in the 2008 when then telecom minister @entity69 gave them start - up spectrum of 4.4 @entity74 at rs 1,651 crore			1
the government was looking crestfallen and defeated and industry was determined to blame it for the poor show			1
" the results of the auction clearly indicate that the reserve price was completely off the mark , with none of the interested operators not pitching in for the circles that they had committed to participate in , " said @entity79 , a partner in @entity80			1
the auction was held after the @entity90 in february this year cancelled 122 licences held by eight telecom operators			0
it ended after 15 rounds on the second day of bidding			0
@entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity100 's @entity99 and @entity102 bid for @entity104 airwaves , but there were no bidders for the cdma spectrum after @entity108 and @entity102 pulled out of the race			2
new players and telecom companies affected by the @entity90 verdict had to win at least four blocks to start or continue their operations			0
while telcos in @entity5 had an eye on their balance sheet as they bid at the auction , the government made little effort in doing roadshows abroad to lure foreign players			1
telcos highlighted several deterrents that led to the poor bids			2
@entity38 's @entity39 said the majority of bidders were operators who had lost their licences and were compelled to participate in the auctions despite the high prices and the limited availability in order to sustain their customers , businesses and to protect their investments			2
this apart , the limiting of spectrum available for auction , which contrary to the @entity90 ruling to auction the entire spectrum related to the quashing of the 2g licences , added to the sense of uncertainty among potential bidders			2
the artificial scarcity created by holding back spectrum combined with the high reserve price dampened any enthusiasm for aggressive bidding by the operators			1
" the auctions have concluded on the exact note as predicted , " said @entity39			0
the only circle that did well in the bids was @entity157 , where the provisional winning price increased by rs 1.7 crore over the reserve price			1
apart from @entity157 , demand was largely concentrated in @entity161 ( @entity162 ) , @entity161 ( @entity163 ) and @entity164			0
meanwhile , @entity165 , which won airwaves in six zones , said it had always maintained that auctions were the best and the only transparent method for allocation of spectrum			0
" our decision to participate in the @entity10 auction was to secure additional spectrum in many circles where we have not received any new @entity10 spectrum since 2008 , " the company said in a statement			2
however , it said that the entire spectrum that is currently unused should be put on auction at the same time with a much lower reserve price			1
" the government should follow @entity63 's advice to abandon staggered spectrum usage fees which are higher for operators who require more spectrum			2
this does not make sense if spectrum is bought in an auction and is paid for already			0
spectrum usage fees should be flat and only represent the charge for administering the spectrum			0
@entity63 has advised to put this at 1 % of revenues , " the @entity102 statement said			0
by @entity198 on january 10 , 2008 , @entity69 with great alacrity and aplomb subverted the system to allocate out of turn spectrum to a handful of beneficiaries at 2001 prices without indexing for inflation			0
he did this despite repeated advice given by different sections in the government to use a market determined auction process			0
on february 2 , 2012 , the @entity90 struck down the award of these licences in a landmark decision clearly establishing malafide			0
the average revenue per user in 2008 for telcos was hovering around rs 300			0
cut to november , 2012 when @entity221 have dropped to sub rs 100 ( rs 97 )			0
by setting an unimaginably high reserve price of rs 14,000 crore for all @entity5 spectrum ( 22 circles ) , a greedy government grossly miscalculated and ended up with egg on its face			1
this was the biggest deterrent for local telcos already staring at a mountain of debt on their balance sheets			0
share prices of top telcos have been beaten down mercilessly due to this very factor			0
just to give you a flavour of what we are talking about - @entity243 ' total debt on march 31 , 2012 was rs 27,871 crore , @entity96 as on end march was rs 14,129 crore while @entity98 was rs 10,138 crore			1
once the @entity90 said transparent market forces should determine the auction reserve price , the cash - strapped government should have paid heed to market realities			1
industry repeatedly told the @entity62 brass that the reserve price could not be linked to @entity255 auction prices			1
a beleaguered government was keen on bridging the ballooning fiscal deficit and the @entity10 spectrum auction was manna from the heavens			0
but the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry			0
on the eve of the auction both the biggies from the @entity267 space - @entity265 and @entity243 - pulled out			0
in fact , @entity243 did not even bid			0
which left the foreign telecoms to plug and play			0
the government of @entity5 made no ostensible move to engage with foreign telecoms , there were no road shows , no hiking of 74 per cent cap in the sector as bait resulting in a desultory and disappointing auction			1
finally , the government has realised a paltry rs 9,407 crore against an estimated rs 40,000 crore			1
if i remember right , in 2008 the government managed to bring in a tad over rs 9,000 crore			1
a scandal - tainted auction in 2008 has been reprised in 2012 viz the amount raised			0
what the government required was fresh foreign capital			0
it could have been more aggressive with its pitch with foreign telecoms not present in @entity5 - but all to no avail			1
it is @entity99 which came forward to bid and win six most populous circles , deciding to stay the course in @entity5 where they had successfully managed to build a sliver of a business			1
once again validating that those who bid , bid selectively and strategically looking to optimise with circles that according to the players had the highest potential for continued growth and profitability			2
that nobody bid for all the circles was most telling			2
what was crucial for this sc - mandated exercise was a little foresight , some planning and vital insight into how telecoms function globally			2
what it ended up doing was getting its maths all wrong and antagonising an already fractured industry			0
a two - day auction is what it managed ultimately , against a 35 - day gruelling @entity255 auction process			0
rs 9,000 crore ball park vs rs 67,000 crore in 2010 is probably the rub of the green , but an abject slap on the face of a government which got ahead of the curve .			2

government had hoped to raise rs 40,000 but netted just rs 9,407 crore
@entity23 and @entity24 circles failed to attract any bidders
not a single bid was received for an all - @entity5 licence
