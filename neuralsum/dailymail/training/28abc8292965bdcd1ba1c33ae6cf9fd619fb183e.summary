by @entity0 parents have been left furious by a scheme punishing schoolchildren for being off sick for just one day by excluding them from a free trip to the ice - cream van			1
pupils at @entity7 in @entity8 with a 97 per cent attendance record at the end of each half - term are rewarded with membership of ‘ @entity13 ’ , entitling them to a free ice - cream			1
but those youngsters who fall short of the benchmark are made to wait indoors while their classmates go to collect their cornets from the van outside			1
prize : children will find out this friday whether they have earned an ice - cream for missing no more than half a day of school since @entity25 ( file picture ) and now some parents have registered formal complaints with headteacher @entity29 , claiming children as young as five are too young to understand why they are not allowed an ice - cream			1
the scheme was launched as a trial in february - with the first round of ice - creams awarded on the last day of term before @entity25			1
children will find out this friday whether they have earned an ice - cream for missing no more than half a day of school since @entity25			1
by friday , there will have been 23 school days since @entity42 , meaning that to achieve at least a 97 per cent record , pupils will need to have attended school for at least 22.5 days in that period			2

the ones who did n’t get it were left in the classroom watching the ice - cream van			2
‘ at the end of the day you ’re talking about pretty young kids who just do n’t understand it			0
the kids in years 1 and 2 , they did n’t understand what was going on			0

at the end of the day you ’re talking about pretty young kids who just do n’t understand it ' local parent ‘ we of course acknowledge that some of our pupils are very young so we have spent considerable time explaining the scheme and the importance of good school attendance to them at the launch of the scheme and throughout the term			0
‘ the age of our pupils also played a factor in deciding that we run this on a half term basis , so that every child has the opportunity to have a fresh start			0
‘ in our experience reward schemes help improve the attendance of pupils , ultimately giving them improved educational outcomes which is key to the school ethos of providing the best education possible			0

pupils at @entity8 school can be rewarded with ' @entity13 ' membership
but only if they have 97 *%* attendance record at the end of each half - term
they must have attended 22.5 out of 23 days for *latest* period since @entity25
children who fall short must wait indoors while classmates get ice - cream
some parents have registered formal complaints with the headteacher
but he *insists* the trial scheme has been well received by most parents
