by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:47 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 19:28 est , 22 april 2013 rags to riches : @entity8 boss @entity7 whose application to strike out a compensation claim by his ex-wife is being heard in the @entity9 back then he was a penniless hippy with no income and no apparent prospect of success			1
but the winds of change transformed @entity7 from a nomadic @entity17 traveller to the multi- millionaire head of one of @entity21 ’s biggest green energy companies			2
it ’s just that they did n’t blow quite so favourably for his ex-wife , whom he divorced without being ordered to pay maintenance			2
so yesterday @entity25 faced the 51 - year - old wind farm entrepreneur across a courtroom over a claim for £ 2million she says she is owed – more than 20 years after they parted			1
mr @entity7 was appealing after the @entity31 in @entity32 refused to dismiss the claim , and ordered him to pay £ 125,000 legal costs			1
yesterday the @entity9 heard miss @entity25 alleged she was treated ‘ with contempt ’ by her ex-husband while he drove increasingly expensive cars and moved into a £ 3million , 18th - century fort in @entity37			1
meanwhile she had to struggle through financial difficulties to raise their son and her other children – as mr @entity7 ’s once - fledgling company developed into @entity8 , currently a massive player in the @entity21 ’s eco energy sector			1
now judges must decide whether to allow the financial claim , back mr @entity7 ’s fight to have it dismissed or , as @entity49 put it yesterday , declare it ‘ so old and stale ’ that it should not be allowed to proceed			1
miss @entity25 , a former aid worker with a daughter from a previous relationship , met mr @entity7 in 1981 and they had a son , @entity53 , two years later			1
the court heard mr @entity7 took up a ‘ nomadic ’ existence as a @entity17 traveller when he and @entity57 , according to mr @entity7 , separated in 1984			2
he disputed miss @entity25 ’s claims that the pair repeatedly rekindled their relationship until the early nineties			0
his barrister @entity62 told the @entity9 that mr @entity7 was not ordered to pay any maintenance as he was broke at the time and living on housing benefit			2
in 1992 , when the couple divorced , mr @entity7 ‘ had a nascent business but no income at all ’ , he said			1
mr @entity7 with his £ 1million electric supercar : his ex-wife @entity25 tried and failed to get him to pay her maintenance while he drove ' better and better ' cars and moved into a £ 3million property , her barrister said living the high life : mr @entity7 , centre , now runs a successful business , while his ex-wife was forced to sleep in a bus garage in order to travel by public transport to the hearing , her barrister claimed at the @entity9 in 1996 he had made a ‘ full disclosure ’ of his financial position to the @entity87 , mr @entity84 said			1
‘ from a modest beginning , with the creation of a wind turbine to power a trailer in which he and his new partner were living , the business developed into a considerable enterprise			0
’ miss @entity25 started a new relationship in 1993 and had two more children , although she did not remarry			0
she later discovered her ex-husband ’s business was flourishing			0
but @entity99 , representing her , said mr @entity7 provided only three very old cars and ‘ sporadic pocket money ’ for his son and stepdaughter until 2001			1
the barrister said between 1996 and 1997 he achieved a ‘ nil assessment ’ for contributions by the @entity87 despite his ‘ apparent wealth ’			0
grand : the £ 3million , 18th - century fort occupied by @entity7 , who faces a £ 125,000 legal bill ' considerable enterprise ' : mr @entity7 in the @entity113 set up a wind energy business with a new girlfriend that developed into @entity8 , now a massive player in the @entity21 's eco energy sector , with over 70,000 customers he said @entity57 , now 53 and living in @entity120 in south - east @entity121 , learned mr @entity7 ’s business was taking off in the mid-nineties and claimed that ‘ the children had been pressured by him not to inform her of his newly acquired wealth ’			1
the @entity128 added : ‘ miss @entity25 repeatedly asked for financial assistance and whether he was going to pay the children more than just pocket money as he was building up his business			0
‘ he treated her with contempt			0
he said if she could not afford to maintain the children , they could live with him			0
’ mr @entity136 said : ‘ this is a lady who has had it financially very difficult			0
‘ she came to court today by getting up early to use the bus , and sleeping in the bus station			0
the contrast between the two [ her and mr @entity7 ] is extreme			2
’ the court reserved judgement on the appeal			0
if it fails , the maintenance claim is expected to be heard by a family judge in june .			0
