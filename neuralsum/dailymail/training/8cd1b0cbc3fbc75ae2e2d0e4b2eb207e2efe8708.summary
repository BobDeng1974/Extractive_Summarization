at one point , @entity9 leaped from a platform into a pit full of foam blocks , and he shot right through them and landed on his head			0
he broke a vertebra in his neck , and was left paralysed from the neck down			1
@entity1 , 22 , was left paralysed from the neck down after an accident at an indoor trampoline centre			1
he wants others to realise how dangerous the seemingly harmless pastime can be mr @entity1 's injury underscores recent warnings from doctors and government officials about the dangers of the jump gyms amid a heightened effort to regulate the indoor trampoline parks as they have become a popular rain - or - shine suburban entertainment for birthday parties and summer camps			1
' anything where something like that can happen , i mean , it 's such a devastating injury , ' the 22 - year - old said of his accident in @entity41			2
' it does n't seem like things are properly regulated if something like that is possible			0
' citing broken necks , shattered leg bones and one death , some doctors say the parks are dangerous and can lead to serious injuries that eclipse any benefits			2
governments are starting to take notice , with proposed regulations in @entity7 and @entity55 among the first attempts in the country to address concerns about safety in the burgeoning industry			1
operators of the trampoline gyms say severe injuries are rare and safety fears are overblown			1
they claim an injury rate lower than organised sports such as baseball or soccer and point out the gyms offer a place for adults and kids to have fun and get much - needed exercise			2
indoor trampolining has become popular in the @entity77 where centres offer fun for adults and children whatever the weather			1
governments are starting to take notice of the phenomenon , with proposed regulations in @entity7 and @entity55 among the first attempts in the country to address concerns about safety for safety , many of the gyms post staffers around trampolines like lifeguards to enforce rules			1
but some doctors say that 's not enough , and they 've asked the health board to step in the parks are typically giant warehouses filled with a series of trampolines that allow customers to bounce every which direction , slam - dunk basketballs and do gymnastics moves			0
this x-ray shows a broken leg caused by playing at a jump gym some parks feature angled trampolines sloping up the sides and pits filled with brick - size foam blocks			0
the industry has grown rapidly , from a handful of centres in the @entity117 @entity77 in 2007 to about 160 throughout the world , according to @entity119 , a standards - development organisation			2
for safety , many of the gyms post staffers around trampolines like lifeguards to enforce rules and require jumpers to first sign a waiver			0
emergency room doctors in one @entity7 county say that 's not enough , and they 've asked the health board to step in			1
' you 'll see a lot of these very severe , open wounds that you do n't see unless you 're in a high - velocity type of injury , ' dr @entity136 , trauma director at @entity137			0
' this is like a war type of injury or a motor vehicle crash			2
' trauma staff at the hospital say they saw 52 injuries requiring multiple doctor visits from area jump gyms from may 2011 to november 2012 , according to their emergency room records			1
most of the patients are young men around 19 years old , they say , and have had injuries such as dislocated feet , brain hemorrhaging and paralysis			1
@entity155 , who manages @entity156 in nearby @entity41 , said her gym already follows many of the health board proposals , but she 's concerned the industry has been unfairly targeted			0
this x-ray shows all the hardware , plates and screws required to fix a fractured ankle caused by a jump gym ms @entity155 said her centre sees few injuries compared to the number of people that participate , citing one major injury for every 20,000 visitors			1
that was mr @entity1 , and she said his jump violated the facility 's rules but that the location still took steps to make the pits safer			1
' my concern is , once they start with this , where is it going to end ? ' she said of the proposed regulations			0
the @entity187 is considering proposals that stipulate gyms must supervise the activities , report their injury rates to the county and warn jumpers about the risks beyond having them sign a waiver			0
the board will have a public discussion on the proposals this fall			0
' we do feel like we have an obligation to inform the public about safety risks out there , especially when it 's just open to general public , ' said dr @entity205 , executive director of the @entity206			0
at the new jump gyms , children and adults take on moves that might previously have be limited to professional gymnasts the @entity7 proposals are partly modeled after legislation pending in @entity55 that would create an inspection program for the parks akin to regulations for amusement park rides , in addition to requirements about insurance , employee training and injury reporting			1
the bill has been promoted by a @entity225 woman whose 30 - year - old son died days after breaking his neck at an @entity229 trampoline park in 2012			2
in @entity231 , the jump gym @entity232 has posted signs warning of rules and risks of " serious catastrophic injury or death " from the activity			0
in addition to requiring participants to sign a waiver , the gym requires jumpers to watch a safety video			0
' we try to make sure that people understand what this activity is all about and that the risks are there just like any other recreational activities , ' owner @entity245 said			0
mr @entity245 said his gym saw more than 150,000 visitors from july 2012 to july 2013 , but during that time had about 11 major injuries that required multiple doctor visits			2
