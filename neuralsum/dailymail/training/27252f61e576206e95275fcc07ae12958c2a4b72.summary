by @entity0 a mother - of - two from @entity2 , @entity3 , has told how her five - year - old daughter was treated like she had a disease for wanting to eat healthy snacks at her summer camp			1
@entity8 wrote on the @entity9 that at an orientation meeting , parents were shown the menu of snacks their children would be given at the camp , which consisted of a daily rotation of @entity17 , @entity21 , pretzels , cookies and cheese curls			1
when she asked that her daughter be given more healthy snacks like fruits and vegetables , the counselors told her she could send the ' special ' food to the nurse 's office , where her child could collect it daily			1
a mother 's concern : when @entity36 ( second right ) requested nutritional camp snacks for her daughter instead of cookies and chips , counselors treated her five - year - old 's healthy eating habits like a disease unhealthy : the normal snack menu provided for campers consists of a daily rotation of cookies , chips , crackers and pretzels , and a serving of fruit only once a week ms @entity53 , founder of child nutrition website @entity54 , noted that singling out a child for eating healthily is a backwards step in a country where one - in - three children is overweight or obese			1
since the camp children would be doing daily sports and activities , she asserted they would need ' a snack that provides them with energy and carries them from lunch to dinner '			0
she was shocked not only that the daily offering of snacks consisted of mainly crackers , cookies and chips , but that it featured a serving of fruit just once a week			0
after complaining to the head counselor , she was eventually sent to the camp nurse , who told her she could send in ' special ' snacks for her daughter , which would be stored in the nurse 's office			1
every afternoon , the counselors said , her daughter could go to the nurse to collect her food			0
but ms @entity53 was disconcerted when she realized that her five - year - old 's healthy eating habits were being treated like a disease			1
' the camp was very happy to accommodate our " special " needs , ' she wrote			0
' what message does it send to tell my daughter she needs to get her " healthy food " from the camp nurse ? ' ' [ they ] reassured me that with all the allergies today , our daughter would n't be the only one eating a " special " diet			2
' surprisingly , when she asked whether other parents had made similar requests , ms @entity53 discovered that the camp only received ' one or two ' complaints about the snacks per year			1
she notes that there is an irony in the fact that the @entity109 officially classified obesity as a disease last week , yet her daughter was being singled out for healthy eating as if it were an irregular diet			2
' my daughter does n't think her diet is " special , " ' she wrote			0
' to her , it 's normal			0
she eats a wide variety of fruits and vegetables throughout the day			0
' instead of treating healthy children differently , ms @entity53 states that camps as well as schools and teachers have a duty to protect children , which includes keeping them safe at the snack table			2
besides , she wrote : ' what message does it send to tell my daughter that to eat " healthy food , " she needs to get her snack at the camp nurse every afternoon ? '			0

@entity8 complained about the unhealthy snacks at her daughter 's summer camp - a daily rotation of @entity17 , @entity21 , cookies and chips
counselors told her she could send ' special ' food to the nurse 's office , where her five - year - old could collect it each day
she notes that treating her daughter 's healthy eating habits as *abnormal* is a backwards step in a country where one - in - three children is overweight or obese
shockingly , the camp *informed* ms @entity53 that they receive only one or two complaints per year about the lack of nutritional snacks
