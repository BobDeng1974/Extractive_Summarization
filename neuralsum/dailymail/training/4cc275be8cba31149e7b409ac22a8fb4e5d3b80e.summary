a 379 - year - old @entity1 ' selfie ' has finally been verified as being painted by the @entity4 @entity3 ’s own hand			1
the authenticity of the famous self - portrait has previously been in doubt , but following eight months of tests , scientists are now certain it is a genuine @entity1 masterpiece			1
the work of art , which has an estimated value of £ 30 million ( $ 50 million ) , is now back on display at the @entity15 ’s @entity14 , near @entity16 in @entity17			0
the painting has been returned to @entity14 , @entity17 , after scientific analysis confirmed it was painted by @entity28 's own hand the painting was given to the @entity15 in 2010 as a gift from the estate of the late @entity32 , @entity33 of @entity34 , and is now the first @entity1 in its collection of 13,500 paintings			1
as the @entity15 cares for items for public benefit forever , it could never be sold			0
in the 31 - inch by 28 - inch ( 91 x 72cm ) portrait , @entity1 is wearing a black velvet cap with two ostrich feathers , a gorget - a decorative metal band worn round the neck and originally part of a military outfit or armour - and a short , decorated velvet cape			1

the painting was given to the @entity15 in 2010 as a gift from the estate of the late @entity32 , @entity33 of @entity34 , and is now the first @entity1 in its collection of 13,500 paintings the painting went through a series of tests to verify its authenticity			1
this included : infra - red reflectography : infrared radiation is often used to ‘ see through ’ paint layers that are impenetrable to the human eye			0
the radiation passes through paint until it reaches something that absorbs it , or it is reflected back to the camera			0
for instance , if an artist has begun a painting by drawing the design in black on a white ground , an infrared image can make this visible			2
x-radiography : the technique can show the different elements of a painting , from the canvas or panel it is painted on to the top paint layer			0
x-radiographs are useful for revealing changes that may have occurred at different stages in the development of a painting			2
an @entity87 records the areas of a work where the x-rays have been impeded			0
for instance , pigments containing heavy metals such as lead and mercury show up , raking light photography : this technique illuminates paintings from a light source at an oblique angle or almost parallel to the surface to provide information about its surface composition			0
in some instances , raking light can help reveal whether a painter changed their intentions			0
it can also help document deterioration over time			0
painted in 1635 , the authenticity of the portrait had previously been thrown into doubt by @entity1 specialist @entity114 and the @entity115 in 1968			1
at the time they felt that certain areas of the painting were not accomplished enough to be by @entity1 , that the date and painting style did not correlate , and the panel type was unusual			1
in 2005 dr @entity123 , one of these experts , concluded that the painting may well be a genuine @entity1 when confronted with an x-radiograph of the painting and other circumstantial evidence			2
in 2012 he had a chance to study the painting at @entity14 where his theory was further confirmed			0
his assurance led the conservation charity to send the painting away to the world famous @entity135 in @entity137 for further scientific analysis			2
@entity139 , a paintings conservator at the institute , explained the scientific work that was carried out to confirm it as a @entity1			2
' the self - portrait went through a series of investigate analyses to include close visual examination under magnification , infra - red reflectography , @entity150 , raking light photography and pigment and medium analysis , ' she said			2
' careful cleaning and removal of several layers of aged and yellowed varnish which had been added to the painting much later , revealed the original colours and painting style beneath			1
' what was revealed was a true depth of colour , much more detail and a three - dimensional appearance to the fabric in @entity1 ’s cloak which had previously been obscured and detracted from the quality of the work in the eyes of the @entity115			1
careful cleaning and removal of several layers of aged and yellowed varnish , which had been added to the painting much later , revealed the original colours and painting style beneath ' next , it was close investigation of the artist ’s signature that gave us one of the biggest clues as to its true authenticity			1
' the signature and date of 1635 , inscribed both on the front and back of the panel , had been considered problematic in previous assessments as it was thought that the style and composition was much more akin to the artist ’s style slightly later in his career			1
' but , the cross-section analysis left no reason to doubt that the inscription was added at the time of execution of the painting			0
' the infrared reflectography and x-ray photography gave further insight into the compositional changes that took place at various stages during the execution of the portrait			1
' for example a white figure - of - eight cuff could be seen in the x-ray , showing how @entity1 ’s left hand was at one stage included in the composition			2
the self - portrait of @entity1 has been carefully hung at the @entity15 ’s @entity14 , near @entity16 in @entity17			1
painted in 1635 , the authenticity of the portrait had previously been thrown into doubt by @entity1 specialist @entity114 and the @entity115 in 1968 ' changes to the outline of the figure , carried out at a late stage and without much care to perfectly match the surrounding paint , were also present , and again , such alterations are present in many of @entity1 ’s own works , suggesting a dynamic process of painting typical of @entity1			1
' @entity225 , paintings and sculptor curator at the @entity15 , said : ' the debate over whether this is or is n’t a @entity1 has been ongoing for decades			0
' the key element for me has been the cleaning			0
the varnish was so yellow that it was difficult to see how beautifully the portrait had been painted			0
' now you can really see all the flesh tones and other colours , as well as the way in which the paint has been handled - it ’s now much easier to appreciate it as a @entity1			1
' with the technical analysis backing up @entity123 ’s claims , we are obviously very excited			0
' caring for the work of one of the great @entity4 masters , although in itself quite daunting , will also give us a great story to tell as we bring the mystery of its authorship to life for our visitors to enjoy			0
' dr @entity123 , a @entity4 art historian who is considered the leading world expert on @entity1 , examined the painting before it returned to @entity14			2
' although i was pretty certain the painting was a @entity1 when i saw it in 2013 , i wanted to further examine it after cleaning and see the results from the technical analysis as this had never been done before , ' he said			1
' with all this additional scientific evidence , i am satisfied it is by @entity1			0

authenticity had previously been doubted by specialist @entity114
he felt parts of the painting were not good enough to be by @entity1
but removal of several layers revealed original colours and style beneath
investigation of artist ’s signature also helped reveal its true authenticity
further analysis provided an insight into the compositional changes that took place at various stages during painting of the portrait
