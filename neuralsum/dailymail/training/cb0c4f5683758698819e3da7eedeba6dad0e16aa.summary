by @entity0 published : 15:48 est , 1 june 2013 updated : 15:51 est , 1 june 2013 even though the @entity3 economy appears to be on the mend , two thirds of @entity3 adults are unhappy these days , with minorities being the most miserable of the bunch , according to a new poll			0
the polling company @entity9 surveyed online 2,345 @entity3 adults between april 10 - 15 , asking them questions to calculate their overall level of happiness			1
according to the findings of the poll , only a third of @entity18 can quality as ' very happy			1
' among the most discontented group are minorities , recent college graduates and people with disabilities			0
sad bunch : @entity9 poll has found that recent college graduates ( left ) and people with disabilities ( right ) are the least likely to quality as ' very happy ' discontented : the @entity29 was especially low among @entity18 , which may be related to the immigration debate mired in controversy an especially deep decline in the @entity29 was registered among @entity18 over the past two years - a trend that has been partially attributed to the acrimonious debate over immigration policy			1
african - americans appear to be less happy today than in 2011 , with 36 per cent qualifying as very happy - down from 44 per cent two years ago			0
however , though the @entity29 was down among black survey participants , they remain roughly as happy as caucasians			2
‘ our happiness index offers insight into what 's on the minds of @entity3 today and is a reflection of the state of affairs in our country , ’ @entity41 , senior vice president of the @entity9 , said in a statement			2
‘ while the attitudes on the economy may be improving , we 're seeing that this is not translating into an improvement in overall happiness			0
’ among @entity18 with disabilities , the percentage of those very happy has slid from 34 to 31 per cent - another drop which may be related to cuts or feared cuts in services as a result of the recently implemented sequester			0
college graduates appear to be less content now than two years ago - a possible casualty of a tough job market coupled with growing doubts about the true value of higher education			0
while it is accepted by most people that money ca n't buy happiness , the survey indicates that having more of it can significantly improve one 's outlook on life			2
happy campers : poll results show that those over the age of 50 are more likely to be happy than their younger counterparts gender gap : men are less likely than women to quality as very happy , according to the @entity9 @entity18 earning under $ 50,000 in annual salary are less likely to qualify as very happy than in 2011 - down from 33 per cent to 29 per cent among those earning less than $ 35,000 , and from 35 per cent to 32 per cent among those earning between $ 35,000 - $ 49,999			1
old age is rarely associated with joy or exuberance , but poll results show that those over the age of 50 are more likely to be happy than their younger counterparts			1
about 41 per cent of adults over age 65 rank highest on the @entity29 , while the least likely to be happy are those between the age of 30 - 39 , with about 28 per cent of this group qualifying as very happy			0
insiders vs outsiders : political independents are less happy that either @entity102 or @entity103 the survey also found that women are happier than men , while political independents are significantly less happy that members of either the @entity102 of the @entity103 parties at 35 per cent each			1
the silver lining of the rather gloomy poll results is @entity18 ' attitude toward work : compared with 2011 , fewer survey participants consider their jobs frustrating .			2

@entity9 poll found that the happiest groups *include* people over 50 and those early more than $ 50,000 a year
