' @entity2 detectives ' investigation - helped by officers from @entity42 - into her disappearance prompted appeals for help across the world			2
but the official inquiry was formally shelved in july 2008 and since then no police force has been actively looking for the missing child , who would now be eight			2

in may this year , the prime minister asked @entity7 to carry out a review of the investigation to bring a ' new perspective ' to the case			1
