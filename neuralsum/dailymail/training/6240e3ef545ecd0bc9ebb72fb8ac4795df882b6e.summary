during his summing - up , the judge asked the jury trying @entity3 , the first @entity4 doctor to stand trial for allegedly carrying out female genital mutilation , to consider whether he was simply a scapegoat			1
by their decision to acquit him , we are entitled to believe that the answer to that question was an emphatic ‘ yes ’			2
indeed , few people – outside the @entity16 – who have followed this disturbing case could have been left in much doubt that dr @entity3 was the real victim			1
back in 2012 , dr @entity3 was a junior registrar in obstetrics and gynaecology at the @entity36 in north @entity37			2
one of his patients was a young pregnant woman identified only as @entity40			2
@entity40 had indeed been subjected to female circumcision in her native @entity42			0
to make it possible for the baby to be delivered , dr @entity3 had to cut through the stitches made during the barbaric procedure			2
afterward , he replaced them to stop the woman , who now lives in @entity4 , bleeding			1
however the prosecution claimed she was stitched in such a way that her urethra was obstructed and the ‘ vagina entrance ’ narrowed			2
this , they claimed , amounted to @entity55			2
the defence disputed this account			0
tellingly , you might think , the notes relating to an examination by an fgm specialist mysteriously went missing			1
would it be too cynical to suggest that if those notes had been as potentially incriminating as the prosecution maintained , they would not have disappeared ? either way , many might think that equating what dr @entity3 did with the almost medieval savagery involved in female genital mutilation beggars belief			1
few people who have followed this disturbing case could have been left in much doubt that dr @entity3 ( pictured ) was the real victim nevertheless , those few stitches cost dr @entity3 his career and his reputation			1
he was suspended by the @entity77 in march following an internal investigation lasting nearly two years			0
he is still facing the ordeal of a @entity77 hearing and possible disciplinary action			0
dr @entity3 and his wife , also a doctor , from @entity83 , @entity84 , who were married in 2010 , delayed moving home and starting a family of their own because of the cloud of suspicion hanging over him			1
he has also received death threats			0
only when the trial got under way did the shortcomings of the evidence against him become scandalously apparent			0
the woman herself , now 27 , did not make an official complaint against dr @entity3			1
it was a midwife who was present during surgery who reported him			0
nor did the patient give a statement to the police			0
‘ @entity40 has no complaints against the doctor , ’ his barrister @entity105 , reminded the court in her final address to the jury			1
‘ do you remember , when giving evidence , she said “ he delivered my first baby ” with a smile on her face			0
’ moreover , dr @entity3 was not a @entity117			1
he is a @entity119 @entity118 who came to this country when he was a boy			1
@entity55 is not practised in @entity118 culture			1
‘ i regard it as an abhorrent practice , ’ he told the court			1
he completed his medical training in 2005			0
he underwent two years further training before training at the @entity128 in @entity37 , arriving at the @entity129 in 2012			0
so why did this case ever come before a jury ? might the real reason have more to do with politics , both inside and outside medicine , than justice , as the judge alluded to in his summing - up			0
the @entity16 has been under increasing pressure from campaigners to secure an @entity55 conviction			1
the number of women and teenage girls in @entity144 and @entity145 who are victims has increased three-fold to 170,000 over the past decade due to the influx of migrants from countries where the practice is widespread			0
only when the trial got under way ( pictured ) did the shortcomings of the evidence against dr @entity3 become scandalously apparent in the majority of these cases @entity55 is thought to have taken place abroad , not in @entity4 , which makes the decision to charge dr @entity3 all the more controversial			1
indeed , the announcement to charge him , in a blaze of publicity , came just days before @entity161 , director of public prosecutions , appeared before the @entity163 home affairs committee to explain why there had been no fgm prosecutions in the @entity4			2
when committee chairman @entity166 expressed his surprise that this prosecution had suddenly occurred almost 30 years after @entity55 was outlawed , miss @entity161 replied : ‘ the fact is we ’ve had the evidence that ’s been supplied to us that ’s enabled us to bring a prosecution , it ’s as simple as that			2
’ not everyone agreed , then or now			0
leading gynaecologist dr @entity178 accused the @entity16 of putting politics before the welfare of women			0
she said she and other obstetricians were ‘ up in arms over the decision to prosecute this case , which involved a woman who had already suffered @entity55 and warned it would distract from the real problem ’			1
' scapegoat ' : bosses at @entity36 ( pictured ) were accused of exploiting dr @entity3 in order to cover up systemic failings indeed , the court heard that the woman at the centre of this story should have been identified as a victim of @entity55 by medics before she gave birth			1
this would have meant she was put on a special care ‘ pathway ’ with midwives who are experienced in dealing with such cases			0
but this opportunity was missed when she arrived at hospital in labour in november 2012			0
‘ if @entity40 had followed the @entity55 pathway he [ dr @entity3 ] would never have been in the situation he found himself , ’ his barrister told the court			1
dr @entity3 had ‘ absolutely no training ’ in this field during his undergraduate studies			1
even so , @entity40 had suffered no problems since dr @entity3 had treated her and had gone on to have a second child and is now expecting a third			2
there were other systemic failures at the hospital			0
no official interpreter was present during @entity40 ’s birth – a position dr @entity3 should not have been placed in			2
and , as we have already said , crucial notes reinforcing the prosecution case went missing			2
‘ these are serious systemic failings , none of which are dr @entity3 ’s fault , ’ his barrister claimed			1
he had , she said , been ‘ hung out to dry			0
’ did ‘ systemic failings ’ within the hospital and mounting pressure to secure an fgm conviction conspire against dr @entity3 ? it ’s is hard to avoid that conclusion			1
in january last year , a report by a left - wing campaigning journalist @entity240 , called @entity241 , said of 3,032 @entity55 cases treated by hospitals in the past three years , only 3 per cent were referred to the police and 11 per cent to local authorities			0
‘ professionals working in this field , ’ the report concluded , ‘ believed that a few high - profile criminal actions could act as a deterrent and demonstrate that the state is taking this form of violence against women as seriously as other forms			0
nothing would boost the campaign against @entity55 more powerfully than some convictions			0
that would send out a message loud and clear that the state is taking the problem seriously			0
’ the @entity3 case has had precisely the opposite effect – and almost ruined a good man and widely respected doctor in the process .			1

@entity3 , 32 , was first @entity4 doctor to face trial for fgm
woman , 27 , who was subject to @entity55 as a child , never supported the case
should have been identified as @entity55 victim before she gave birth , court told
notes on examination by an fgm specialist mysteriously went missing
doctor , a @entity119 @entity118 , told court : ‘ i regard it as an abhorrent practice ’
he was cleared by jury amid claims he was used by hospital as ' scapegoat '
@entity16 has been under increasing pressure from campaigners to secure @entity55 conviction
