the @entity0 has spent about $ 1.2 million on impotence medications since they first went on its insurance plan 's formulary , including more than a half - million dollars last year alone			1
federal government contract records , filed under the category ' troop support , ' show just how reliant @entity8 's fighting men have become on the little blue pill that can add between - the - sheets pushups back into their regular fitness regimen			1
tapayers began footing the bill for erectile dynfunction medicine in 1998 , when the military 's @entity15 medical plan added @entity17 and covered up to six pills per month			1
records for those early years are hard to come by because @entity0 physicians were required to special - order the medication for each patient			2
by 2008 , however , the government began issuing regular contracts to stock the pills in its pharmacies			0
@entity28 , blue pills : the @entity0 has paid for countless doses of @entity17 for men in the field and stateside now with extra taxpayer dollars : the @entity8 military has ramped up its purchases of @entity17 for servicemen , spending more than $ 504,000 last year alone the @entity37 uncovered some of those records			1
a broader survey of contracts shows $ 1,199,785 in purchases in the last seven years , of which 89 per cent were for @entity17			2
other brands including @entity44 and @entity45 reeived narrower distribution to military men			2
@entity15 provides ' medically necessary ' and ' appropriate ' remedies for erectile dysfunction , and it does n't stop with pills			0
' external vacuum appliances ' – a polite euphemism for penis pumps – are covered , as are penile implants , testicular prostheses and hormone injections the @entity0 's @entity57 decides what does and does n't make the cut			1
most of the @entity17 orders have been 30 - pill bottles of 100mg tablets , delivered by a single pharmaceutical vendor in @entity65 , @entity66			0
@entity15 forms filled out by prescribing physicians require a diagnosis for men under 50 that shows they suffer from ' organic impotence ' – a condition that reduces blood fllow to the sex organs or causes nerve damage			0
about $ 1.2 million in taxpayer funds has paid for erectile dysfunction pills used by military men it 's not a @entity79 : the @entity0 's @entity15 medical insurance plan now covers ' external vacuum devices ' – penis pumps – to treat erectile dysfunction , along with a range of miracle pills soldiers , sailors , airmen and @entity89 over 50 do n't need to qualify – if the doctor says they need it , the taxpayers foot the bill			1
but @entity0 physicians are not permitted to provide the drugs to men whose impotence is entirely due to psychological factors			0
there are no records online that indicate the @entity101 is purchasing impotence drugs for its patients , which suggests that men who leave the armed services must use private insurance to cover the cost – or pay out - of - pocket .			0
