by @entity0 published : 20:16 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 20:28 est , 14 december 2012 easing the burden : business minister @entity2 will set out measures aimed at preventing regulators from burdening small businesses council and quango jobsworths who regulate small businesses face a ‘ bonfire of excessive red tape ’ in a fresh crackdown on their box - ticking culture			1
ministers want to prevent regulators from needlessly burdening businesses and stifling economic growth			2
they will tell the ‘ men with clipboards ’ to use common sense before intervening , and are planning a dramatic overhaul of their guidelines			1
in the future , regulators will be forced to consider whether their actions will impinge on a business ’s ability to grow and be productive			2
the move , ordered by business minister @entity2 , may be viewed with some scepticism among business leaders , as it is the latest in a long line of desperate attempts to get heavy - handed overseers off the backs of small and medium - sized enterprises			1
but mr @entity2 is determined to make a difference			2
he said : ‘ we have started a bonfire of excessive red tape , but i know that it is just as important that we look at the way that regulations are enforced			1
‘ there is room for far more effective enforcement which reduces the burden on businesses which stick to the rules			0
’ last week chancellor @entity48 set out a ‘ package of measures ’ to tackle systemic problems in the way that regulations are enforced by over-zealous officials			1
these included forcing regulators to take into account the potential economic impact of their actions before intervening			2
in one example , the owner of a factory producing blue cheese was told by his council that he could not have mould on his produce			0
yesterday the @entity68 also promised to overhaul the appeals process			0
at the moment , if a decision is made against a business or company by its local authority , it has to appeal to the same body that made the judgment in the first place			0
on top of this , companies have to accept the initial judgment that they were in the wrong before they can appeal , meaning they are forced to appeal against a decision they have accepted			0
businesses also say that they can not complain openly about their local authority , for fear they will be targeted			0
because they have the power to spring surprise inspections , businesses say , local regulators will ‘ make their lives hell ’ if they are publicly criticised			0
ministers will spend a month reviewing the flaws in the system before proposing changes			0
mr @entity2 added that non-financial regulators , such as the @entity101 and the @entity102 , will face a much tougher regime to cut out ‘ crazy ’ rulings			1
about 60 non-financial regulators , as well as local councils across @entity107 and @entity108 , will be hit by mr @entity2 ’s changes			1
systematic problems : @entity48 last week set out a ' package of measures ' to deal with the way regulations are enforced by over-zealous officials cabinet office minister @entity116 has previously said that the government ’s ‘ bonfire of the quangos ’ – designed to cut down on state - backed organisations which sprung up during @entity123 ’s period in office – would save taxpayers £ 2.6billion by 2016			1
but the figures have been called into question by mps on the @entity128 , who say shutting down government organisations incurs massive costs			0
dr @entity131 , from the @entity132 , said : ‘ the government does deserve some credit for slowing down the flow of new regulation			0
’ he added : ‘ but only now are they starting to tackle the mountain of existing regulation that many businesses face			1

small business regulators *warned* they face a ' bonfire of excessive red tape '
