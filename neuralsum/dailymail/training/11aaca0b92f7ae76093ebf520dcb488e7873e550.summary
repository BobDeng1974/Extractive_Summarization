by @entity0 six years ago @entity1 found himself watching a situation we all dread , as his beloved grandpa who could no longer live alone , moved into a retirement home			1
while helping to pack up his home , he uncovered a box full of extraordinary photos his grandfather @entity10 had taken throughout his life			1
@entity1 , who is originally from @entity12 , took the images to show his grandfather , but sadly he could not remember much about them or where they were taken			1
what made the discovery more interesting was that his grandfather had never mentioned his passion for photography , or many of his trips abroad			1
' i was hoping to make him a book or something			2
something to give him more to talk about , more to think about in that home other than catheter bags and test results			2
it worked for a while but he never really believed that the photos were that good			2
he thought i was just being nice			0
' from that moment @entity1 's project began ; he knew he had to show his beloved grandpa how good the photos were , and help him remember the stories behind them			1
eager to find out more about the photos and make his grandpa believe in his talent , he decided to reach out to the world for help			1
the 34 - year - old art director , who has worked at @entity45 advertising agency in @entity46 , used his creative side to put together a website			2
while he could recognise some of the locations instantly , including his @entity51 's stunning shot of the @entity46 skyline , a few of the photos were harder to place			2
he called on the public to help him narrow down and locate the whereabouts of the images , and his idea proved to be an overwhelming success			2
thousands of people flocked to help him discover where the photos were taken , helping @entity1 piece his grandfather 's history together			1
with the help of hundreds of responses on the website , he was able to track down most of the photos locations			1
the striking photos were taken in @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and all over @entity76			2
taken in the @entity79 area , @entity73 , @entity80 - the @entity77 is now a @entity81 @entity46 's @entity82			0
' taken from a pedestrian walkway			0
many people on @entity87 helped find this one , ' @entity1 said @entity89 view : taken outside the train station at @entity91 in @entity76 @entity10 looking very dapper in his ala @entity93 style suit at his home in @entity96 the hustle and bustle outside the entrance to the empire state building on @entity101 looking @entity102 towards 33rd street in @entity46 @entity1 is not too sure where this photo was taken but the best guess on @entity107 is @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity80			1
he 's hoping to find this one on his trip from a rooftop looking down onto a ferris wheel and a roller coaster at an amusement park at @entity115 , @entity72 , in @entity116 not long after @entity1 moved to @entity46 after that to chase ' the big job ' as an art director in @entity120			1
' i had been talking about @entity51 's photos for way too long and one of the agencies i worked at even put them into an exhibition			2
i was able to go home and tell @entity51 he was in an ' exhibition in @entity46 '			2
( that 's a really big deal in @entity75 )			0
' that blew his mind			0
everyone within a 5 mile radius ( his scooter range ) of the nursing home knew all about it			2
it was working , he was n't talking about urinary tract infections and how bleak the home was			1
' he says some of his favourite photos include one of his grandmother relaxing on the beach in @entity75 , and another where his grandfather is head of the table enjoying a meal with family			1
' most of the family ones are great to me as i get to see family in scenarios i 've never seen them in			0
happy smiling shots of youth , bright colours and always happy times			0
not one single hospital bed , waiting room or nursing home ' also the one where my @entity162 is in the photos it 's pretty obvious he was around at the family in - laws for dinner			1
they got divorced when i was 2 so these are weird and funny and my @entity162 looks hilarious			0
' picture perfect : a photo of @entity171 in @entity76 which is as idyllic as a postcard the misty atmosphere at @entity91 railway train station in @entity76 ' this was taken in @entity176 , @entity76			0
probably taken out of a cab driving over a short bridge called the @entity179			0
the bridge in the photo is called ' @entity182 ' - i had no idea where this was until putting up the site , ' @entity1 said ' not sure where this was taken			1
seems to be that @entity51 travelled down overland from @entity91 to northern @entity80			0
it has been suggested that this is possibly the @entity192 not far from the alps , ' @entity1 says catch of the day : @entity1 thinks this photograph was probably taken on a fishing trip that his @entity51 was on more than likely off the coast of @entity96 in @entity75 sadly his @entity51 has since passed away , but @entity1 is determined to keep his memory alive through celebrating his photos			1
he explains that the striking photographs are not only a way to keep @entity10 ' memory alive , but also an insight into parts of his life he never knew			1
the art director who has been living in @entity46 for the last four years , recently decided to pack up his bags and head home to @entity75 wanting to be closer to family			1
however he thought of a much more interesting and scenic route home			2
instead of paying an extravagant airfare to fly straight to @entity75 , the creative thinker decided to get a much more reasonably priced flight to @entity214			0
after @entity1 is headed to @entity215 to see family and not one to miss out on an opportunity , he is going to visit all of the places where his beloved grandfather took his photos			1
' i think the next generation will have a different experience because we take photos of everything			0
most people in 20 years will be able to see what their parents ate on any given tuesday , in - between lunch and dinner			1
' ' i 'm not sure how it will be			0
but it 's great to think that photos i take on this trip will be around for my future kids to see and especially for my @entity236 , @entity51 's daughter now			0
' ' the aim is to get as many people as possible to appreciate @entity239 even if he is n't here anymore			1
somehow it almost feels like he is alive for a tiny bit longer			0
i know that sounds weird but talking about him so much and looking at his photos is somehow like having him around			0
maybe just not forgetting him i guess			0
' the @entity249 in @entity74 , @entity250			0
at the time it may have been called @entity252 a canal possibly near @entity254 in @entity76 and looks as though it has been taken through the window of a train or bus ' this is my @entity259 , @entity260 on the beach			0
probably in @entity96 , @entity75			0
i ca n't work out what she 's reading			0
such a great shot , typical of @entity75 life in @entity266 , ' @entity1 says @entity1 is not 100 per cent sure where this was taken but he guesses it is in @entity76 and it has been suggested on the website that it is somewhere along the @entity271 - a river in @entity76 taken from the top of @entity274 in @entity46 looking out across the @entity275 in a westerly direction numerous people from thee website are quite certain this was taken in an alley way in @entity281 , @entity80 the @entity282 : another photograph taken from the top of the @entity274 in @entity46			1
