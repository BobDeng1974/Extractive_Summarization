@entity0 was forced to unveil a series of changes to @entity4 ’s mansion tax plan yesterday – including a charge of £ 3,000 a year on homes worth up to £ 3million			1
the @entity8 ’s announcement of the controversial levy on homes worth £ 2million or more was the centrepiece of the @entity4 conference – with the money earmarked for the @entity13			1
but it has been attacked by senior @entity4 figures , who say it will penalise pensioners who live in houses that happen to have soared in value , and the @entity21 said yesterday that the plans were ‘ unravelling ’			2
he also revealed that @entity4 ’s mansion tax will cost about £ 250 a month for someone in a home worth between £ 2million and £ 3million			1
this adds up to a maximum £ 3,000 a year – £ 500 above the average council tax bill for properties in top rated @entity38 owners would pay mansion tax on top of council tax			1
mr @entity0 also said foreign owners with second homes in the @entity44 could be forced to pay ‘ a larger contribution ’ than people living in their only home			2
thousands of @entity49 homes could be hit by the plan to impose the levy on properties worth more than £ 2million writing in the @entity53 , mr @entity0 addressed concerns that ‘ cash poor , asset rich ’ households would suffer			1
‘ @entity58 should be protected and wealthy foreign investors must finally make a proper tax contribution in this country , ’ he said			0
the tax would be ‘ fair , sensible and proportionate ’ , he claimed , adding : ‘ we will ensure those owning properties worth £ 2 - 3million will only pay an extra £ 250 a month			1
owners and investors in properties worth tens of millions of pounds should make a much bigger contribution			0
’ responding to the charge that poorer pensioners in expensive properties would be hit , he vowed that ‘ long - standing residents ’ on less than the higher rate of income tax — that is , less than £ 42,000 a year — would have a right to defer the charge ‘ until the property changes hands ’			1
senior labour mps @entity81 ( left ) and dame @entity83 have spoken out about the mansion tax and its impact on @entity49 mr @entity0 also addressed concerns that rapidly rising property prices in @entity49 would see ever - more households sucked into the tax			1
he said the threshold would rise in line with the average prices of homes costing £ 2million and more , rather than in line with average house prices			2
‘ we will guarantee that more modest properties are not brought into the tax , ’ he said			0
it is estimated that 108,000 homes – the vast majority in @entity49 and the @entity102 – will be caught by the tax			2
@entity104 of the @entity105 offered the @entity8 some support , saying it was ‘ perfectly possible ’ that the proposals would raise the £ 1.2billion that mr @entity0 wanted for the @entity13			0
but he said it would mean people with a home worth £ 3million and above having to pay ‘ substantially ’ more			2
@entity112 , exchequer secretary to the treasury , said @entity4 ’s plans were in chaos			0
‘ @entity4 ’s @entity13 promise has unravelled , ’ he said			0
‘ this panicked change in policy shows @entity120 and @entity0 ’s homes tax wo n’t raise the money they say it will			0
' you ca n’t protect the @entity13 if you ca n’t make the sums add up and bankrupt the economy like @entity4 did last time			0
‘ the only way to secure the future of our @entity13 is to stick to our long - term economic plan			0
