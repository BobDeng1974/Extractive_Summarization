by @entity1 reporter published : 14:19 est , 14 january 2013 updated : 15:45 est , 14 january 2013 a millionaire property developer and his wife , who say they were ruined because of a simple banking error , have lost their @entity7 claim for more than £ 3milion in damages			0
@entity9 and @entity10 are now faced with a £ 1million legal bill after they were left living in a bungalow on a building site near their former home - £ 4million @entity15 , a @entity19 country estate once sought after by the actor @entity20			1
the couple , both 66 , claimed @entity22 wrongly told credit reference agencies mr @entity24 was over his agreed overdraft limit , ruining his credit rating and killing their business			1
ruined : @entity9 and @entity10 say they were ruined because of a simple banking error			2
they lost their claim for more than £ 3million in damages judge @entity33 rejected claims of negligence , breach of contract and defamation and said the couple probably would have lost their assets in the credit crunch anyway			1
the @entity45 had ‘ borrowed beyond their means ’ and their business would have been unlikely to survive the crash in the property market , he said			0
speaking after the judgment was handed down , mrs @entity10 told judge @entity49 : ‘ it is an absolute mockery , i have £ 30 in my bank account ’			1
the judge , who heard the @entity7 trial last year , said the @entity45 had been successful property developers who ‘ lived the lifestyle of prosperous , indeed wealthy , people ’			0
they sold their £ 2million home in @entity59 in 2004 and moved to @entity15 , a medieval manor house with substantial grounds and outlying cottages			0
there , they had space for mrs @entity10 's stable of quarter horses , a £ 240,000 mobile home , as well as mr @entity24 's @entity69 and collection of @entity72 motorcycles			1
the judge continued : ‘ plainly , they were not afraid of borrowing , as some people are , but regarded being overdrawn for business and living purposes as a normal condition , confident of being able to repay when their ship came in			0
' former home : the couple were left living in a bungalow on a building site in the shadow of their previous home - £ 4million @entity15 ( pictured ) disaster struck for the couple in april 2008 when they were refused remortgage finance by @entity92 on their home , which they needed to plough into development projects			1
they soon learned that @entity22 had provided reports to credit reference agencies stating that mr @entity24 's account was ‘ delinquent ’ , since it was £ 260,000 overdrawn when the agreed limit was only £ 1,500			1
lack of finance resulted in the collapse of development projects and their @entity104 business , the repossession of @entity15 and mr @entity24 's eventual bankruptcy			2
unable to fund anywhere else to live , they moved into a bungalow , owned by their son , on the boundary of the historic @entity15 estate , in @entity114 , near @entity115			0
the bungalow was part of a development property and so the couple , who had once lived in the nine - bed stately home , were left living a stone 's throw away , surrounded by building works			2
they sued on the basis that , although mr @entity24 was indeed £ 260,000 overdrawn , it was with the permission of the bank and should not have led to adverse credit reports			1
claims : the couple claimed @entity22 wrongly told credit reference agencies mr @entity24 was over his agreed overdraft limit giving his judgment today , judge @entity49 said that , on the evidence before him , the bank was correct in saying that the account was well overdrawn			1
the higher limit had been sanctioned to provide funds in february 2007 , but for four months only , after which it reverted to the £ 1,500 limit			0
the information disclosed by the bank to the credit agencies was with mr @entity24 's contractual consent and was ‘ true and not misleading ’ , he said			1
‘ it is more probable that , like so many others , the @entity45 , who had prospered on the rising market but had spent their profits and continued borrowing beyond their means , would not have been able to survive the falling market even if these credit reports had not been published , and even if they had continued to speculate with more borrowed money into 2009			0
‘ in short , they would probably have lost their net assets , which were in fact very few , in any event			0
’ the judge allowed a counterclaim by the bank for the repayment by @entity24 of £ 847,287 in outstanding loans and overdrafts , as well as £ 80,000 in costs			2
mr @entity24 had originally been a claimant in the case , but his claim was bought by the bank from his trustee in bankruptcy and discontinued			2
he was in court alongside his wife throughout .			0

@entity9 and @entity10 were left living in a bungalow on a building site

judge rejected claims and mr @entity24 and his wife - who says she has £ 30 remaining in her account - now face legal bill of £ 1m
