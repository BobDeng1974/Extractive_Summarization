by @entity0 published : 04:03 est , 5 september 2012 updated : 04:03 est , 5 september 2012 scientists believe they are on the verge of solving the 70 - year - old mystery of dark matter			1
the structure of the observable universe suggests there is a lot of matter that we simply can not see , and astronomers , cosmologists and particle physicists have been looking for answers to what it could be			0
but now the @entity18 satellite has picked up radiation beams from the centre of the @entity21 , and scientists believe they have discovered proof that dark mater exists - otherwise the alternative would re-write physics as we know it			1
@entity27 , professor of cosmology at the @entity29 at the @entity30 , said : ' the radiation can not be explained by the structural mechanisms in the galaxy and it can not be radiation from supernova explosions			2
' we believe that this could be proof of dark matter			1
otherwise , we have discovered absolutely new ( and unknown for physics ) mechanism of acceleration of particles in the galactic centre			2
' radiation map of the skies : a false colour image of the whole sky as seen by @entity18 , the space observatory in this image , the dust of the @entity21 is shown in blue , with a red band across the centre showing hot regions			1
the mottled yellow area above and below represents relic radiation , otherwise known as the @entity56 , created in the fireball of the @entity58 13.7 billion years ago , which is the oldest light in the @entity59			0
such an image allows scientists to study both the origins of the @entity59 and the birth of stars in our galaxy			0
researchers were studying data from the @entity18 satellite , launched in 2009			1
the satellite does not just remain still in space , but changes direction every hour as well as rotates once a minute on its own axis			0
these movements mean that it scans the entire surrounding universe in the course of six months , using extremely sensitive instruments that can map microwave radiation in the entire sky with great precision			0
the latest data from the @entity18 mission reveals unusual radiation from our own galaxy , which open a new direction in understanding the most fundamental properties of the space , time and matter in the @entity59			1
@entity27 said : ' we have observed a very unique emission of radio radiation from the centre of our galaxy , the @entity21			1
' by using different methods to separate the signal for very broad range of wavelengths , we have been able to determine the spectrum of the radiation			0
' the radiation originates from synchrotron emission - electrons and positrons circulating at high energies around the lines of the @entity107 in the centre of the galaxy , and there are quite strong indications that it could come from dark matter			1
' @entity18 produced its first all - sky image in 2010 , and scientists are currently working to analyse and parse the various and complex elements @entity27 said that leading scientists like @entity118 professor @entity117 have predicted , using calculations , that dark matter may consist of very heavy particles that are around 10 times as heavy as the @entity123 particle , that is to say , 1,000 times heavier than a proton			1
but they have very unique properties and do not interact with ‘ normal ’ matter particles			0
dark matter particles are also usually very scattered and do not interact with each other			2
' but we know from theoretical predictions that the concentration of dark matter particles around the centre of galaxies is very high and we have a strong argument they can collide there and in the collision electrons and positrons are formed			1
' these electrons and positrons start to rotate around the magnetic field at the centre of the galaxy and in doing so produce this very unusual synchrotron radiation			2
it has simply not been possible to observe this radiation in such detail before , as previous instruments have not been sensitive enough			0
but with @entity18 , this unusual radiation is seen very clearly			2
' the results have been published in @entity151			0
and submitted to the scientific journal , @entity153 .			0

@entity18 satellite picks up beams of radiation from centre of @entity21 which could prove existence of ' dark matter '
researchers at @entity29 say radiation is either proof - or something currently unknown to physics
