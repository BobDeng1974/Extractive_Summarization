the @entity2 gang - rape victim 's father has called on all countrymen to watch a banned documentary which showed his daughter 's killer blaming the student for ' being out at night '			1
@entity9 's daughter was described as the ' bitter truth ' by the young woman 's father after it quoted the views of her rapist @entity15 , who is on death row over the 2012 attack			1
the film by award - winning @entity20 @entity19 , who produced 1999 indie hit @entity22 , was due to air on the @entity24 and @entity9 news channel @entity25 to mark @entity26 this sunday			1
but it was dropped by @entity25 following a ban on the film by the @entity9 government , and the @entity24 brought forward its screening to last night , citing a strong public interest			1
' we will investigate and the @entity48 ( @entity49 ) will take action accordingly			0
the conditions have been breached so action will be taken accordingly			0
i wo n't comment any further			0
' the hour - long documentary aired as part of the long - running @entity56 series on @entity24 , and is believed to have been accessed by many in @entity9 on sites such as @entity59			1
today the victim 's family showed their support for the film , saying the rapist 's comments had to be be exposed because they expressed how many people still think			1
the victim 's father , who is named in the documentary but kept anonymous by some international news agencies , told @entity25 the film was ' the bitter truth '			1
horror : the crew obtained an interview with killer @entity15 , who said the student was to blame ' everyone should watch the film , ' he said			1
' if a man can speak like that in jail , imagine what he would say if he was walking free ? ' the victim 's mother added she did not object to the ban but believed @entity15 's views were widespread in @entity9			1
' i do n't care what the government does , bans the film , does n't ban the film , the only thing i know is that nobody is afraid , ' she said			2
' it is not only @entity15 who thinks like this			2
' @entity15 was one of five men convicted over the rape and murder of the physiotherapy student , who was lured aboard a bus along with a friend in december 2012			1
once inside , bus driver @entity15 , his brother @entity101 , gym instructor @entity102 , 20 , bus cleaner @entity103 , 28 , fruit - seller @entity105 , 19 , and an unnamed teenager launched the attack			1
the attackers beat her friend and took turns raping the woman			0
they penetrated her with a rod , leaving severe internal injuries that caused her death			0
she died a fortnight later after suffering terrible injuries to her abdomen , genitals and intestines			0
her death prompted mass protests and led to speedier trials and tougher penalties for rape			2
yet many still hold the firm belief that women are subservient - illustrated by convict @entity15 , who told the documentary his victim would still be alive if she had not objected			2
' when being raped , she should n't fight back , ' he said			2
' she should just be silent and allow the rape ... then they 'd have dropped her off after " doing her " , and only hit [ her friend ] the boy			0
' he claimed ' you ca n't clap with one hand - it takes two ' and insisted : ' a decent girl wo n't roam around at 9 o'clock at night			1
film - maker @entity19 , an award - winner who produced the 1999 hit @entity22 , said : ' the more they try to stop the film , the more they are going to pique people 's interest			2
now , everyone is going to want to see it ' protest : @entity151 's death sparked outrage in @entity9 with many taking to the @entity2 streets to demand better protection for women and a change in a culture which sees them as second - class citizens ' a girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy			1
boy and girl are not equal			0
housework and housekeeping is for girls , not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things , wearing wrong clothes			0
' about 20 per cent of girls are good			0
' the views , which have prompted horror around the world , are not exclusive to the girl 's attacker			0
the rapists ' own defence lawyer @entity177 told the documentary : ' we have the best culture			1
in our culture , there is no place for a woman			0
' home minister @entity42 said of the film : ' under no circumstances should this be telecast ' a second defence lawyer , @entity188 , said if his daughter or sister ' engaged in pre-marital activities ... in front of my entire family , i would put petrol on her and set her alight '			1
the exact reasons for the government 's ban were initially mired in confusion			0
home minister @entity42 told parliament yesterday that the government sought the ban because @entity15 's comments were ' highly derogatory and an affront to the dignity of women '			1
one government minister , @entity207 , called it a ' conspiracy to defame @entity9 '			2
there were heated questions over how the documentary crew gained permission to interview the convicted rapist amid concerns he was being given a platform			0
spokesman @entity217 said the @entity2 police had petitioned the court for a ban on the grounds that the film 's ' objectionable content ' could cause public disorder			2
yet campaigners criticised the government for appearing more worried about the country 's reputation than about the dangers women face			0
' banning this movie is not the answer , ' said @entity233 , an independent mp			0
' we have to confront the issue that men in @entity9 do not respect women and any time there is a rape , blame is put on the woman			2
' film - maker ms @entity19 said : ' the more they try to stop the film , the more they are going to pique people 's interest			0
now , everyone is going to want to see it			0
' @entity251 protests : the december 2012 gang - rape and murder of a young physiotherapy student highlighted the frightening level of violence against women in @entity9 and led to a major reform of the country 's rape laws			1

@entity9 's daughter aired on @entity24 last night despite ban in @entity9
it interviewed victim 's family after gang - rape shocked nation in 2012
student , 23 , was *lethally* raped by five men on a bus in @entity2
*greatest* horror came from interview with one of the rapists on death row
@entity15 said : ' you ca n't clap with one hand - it takes two '
and defence lawyer ' would set own daughter on fire for pre-marital *sex* '
home minister @entity42 vows to take action against the @entity24
