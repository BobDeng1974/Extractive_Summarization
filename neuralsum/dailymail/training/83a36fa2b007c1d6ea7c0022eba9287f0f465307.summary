when it comes to their loved ones , most people are content to wear their hearts on their sleeves			0
but one @entity6 artist has taken the expression a step further by stitching portraits of his family , friends and girlfriend into the palms of his hands			1
artist @entity15 , 21 , uses his body as a canvas for his project @entity19 which illustrates how much the members of his family , including his girlfriend , @entity22 , are woven into his life			1
this picture shows his brother each eye - watering artwork takes about four hours to complete , after which @entity15 , a music student and artist , films himself picking the stitches out of his hands			1
using a needle he very carefully pierces the top layer of his skin before drawing the thread through to create a stitch			1
he then repeats the process with different coloured thread for up to four hours to create surprisingly detailed pictures of people who have influenced him			2
scarred : the palms of @entity15 's hands are now permanently scarred with partial outlines of the portraits @entity15 has so far created around 20 of the artworks featuring family members including his brother @entity65 ( pictured ) after completing each picture @entity15 picks the needlework out of his hand before starting on the next one this picture shows @entity71 's friend @entity70 recreated as an intricate artwork stitched into his hand and remarkably , an outline of each face is still visible in the picked flesh of his hand - but there is very little blood			1
@entity15 , from @entity78 , @entity6 , says the process does n't hurt because it is only superficial , but admits that pain would n't bother him anyway			2
' every person we meet makes us in some way , ' he said			0
' their image projects onto us , reminding us where we come from			0
@entity86 marks : @entity15 will be hoping to impress his teacher , @entity87 , with this picture of him sew into his flesh @entity15 the works cause him no pain , which is what his cousin @entity92 will be hoping after seeing this picture of her friends forever : the face of @entity15 's friend @entity96 will now be forever visible as an outline on his hand @entity15 has used coloured threat here to pick out the detail around his aunt @entity101 's eyes and mouth ' by sewing into the palm of my hand i paint the faces of the people that have left their mark on my life : family , friends , partners , teachers			2
' their lives have been interwoven with mine to build my history			0
' each portrait uses different coloured threads and intricate techniques to capture the resemblance of each individual family member			0
@entity15 was probably cursing his grandmother @entity129 's long hair while making this image of her love me tender : @entity22 , david 's girlfriend , is lovingly recreated using a needle and thread through his palm @entity15 claims that ' pain is no boundary ' to his art , such as creating this picture of his father twenty pictures have so far been made , though @entity15 insists he will go no making more but it is clear that the most detailed work goes into the eyes and mouth			1
so far , he has stitched the likeness of his brother , @entity65 ; his grandfather , @entity15 ; his aunt , @entity151 ; his father ; his girlfriend , @entity22 ; his grandmother , @entity129 ; his friend , @entity96 ; his teacher , @entity87 and many more .			0
