by @entity0 published : 19:55 est , 5 april 2013 updated : 20:08 est , 5 april 2013 surrounded by mobiles ringing , emails pinging , screens flickering and worries about work , it is impossible to get enough sleep these days			2
or so we tend to believe			0
in reality , we ’re actually getting more shut - eye than we were 30 years ago , a study has claimed			1
research has revealed the proportion of adults managing at least nine hours of sleep a night has risen sharply since the early 1980s			1
new research suggests we get more sleep than we did 30 years ago one in four now gets a full nine hours on most nights , compared with fewer than one in six in 1983			1
meanwhile , the numbers getting by on six hours or fewer has fallen to just 10 per cent , down from 15 per cent three decades ago			1
the @entity22 research calls into question the notion that our 24 - hour society has disrupted conventional sleeping patterns			1
@entity27 , professor of psychological medicine at the university , said : ‘ in the @entity31 , short sleep has been less common in every survey since 1983 , but long sleep has been more common			2
this turns the concept of an increasingly sleep - deprived society on its head			0
’ instead , researchers believe the perception that we are all sleeping less stems from the fact that populations in developed countries are ageing and actually need less rest			0
sleep deprivation has emerged as a major concern in recent years			0
in 2010 , a team of @entity31 and @entity48 researchers found that regularly getting fewer than six hours a night could increase the risk of premature death by 12 per cent			1
sleep deprivation has become a major health concern in recent years last year , @entity54 scientists reported that two hours of missed slumber is enough to stop the brain from laying down and storing memories – and simply dropping from eight hours of sleep to six could make the difference			2
and a @entity61 study found men who snooze for an average of nine hours a night may be half as likely to develop prostate cancer , possibly because lack of sleep may trigger inflammation in blood vessels			1
but the latest research casts doubt on how many of us are actually affected by sleep deprivation			0
it pooled data from surveys carried out down the years in the @entity31 as well as @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity48 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and the @entity83			0
‘ we found strong evidence that long sleep durations have become more common in adults in the majority of countries examined , ’ the researchers said			2
‘ but the prevalence of short sleep duration has shown no consistent increase over the last three decades			0
’ however , they warned that sleeping too long can also be harmful			0
previous studies have indicated lying in bed for more than eight or nine hours every night could signal mental health problems , conditions such as diabetes or even the early stages of alzheimer ’s disease .			1

adults managing at least nine hours a night has risen sharply
one in four now gets nine hours each night
it was one in six in 1983 , according to study by the @entity22
