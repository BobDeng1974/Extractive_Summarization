from scrambling for a passport at the airport , to checking the safety of your wallet on a busy street , plucking items out of a stuffed backpack can be a pain			2

former engineer from @entity104 has created the wolffepack bag
it will let wearers get item out of the backpack without taking it off their shoulders - using an ' orbital trapeze ' system
user pulls a strap to release the main body of the bag and can swing it round to their front to *access* items , returning it again with the same action
@entity181 *'s* made for crowded places and where people want to keep valuable safe
backpack is available to pre-order on @entity109 from £ 85 ( $ 137 )
