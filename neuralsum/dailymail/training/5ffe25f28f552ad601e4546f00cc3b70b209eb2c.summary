mr @entity34 , 49 , who lives in @entity39 , said : ' i was out on safari early one morning and came across a large buffalo herd grazing in the marshes			1
' approaching the herd was the resident pride of lions			2
' the lions began to stalk and the matriarch lioness , about 13 years old , broke free and ran towards a female buffalo and her baby calf who had drifted apart from their herd			1
' the calf was surprisingly quick for its age , but its mother reacted instinctively , putting herself between her calf and the lions			0
' the calf escaped and ran down the embankment and into the water where another lioness pounced			0
a bull buffalo waded in to help and charged at the lioness , who let go of the calf			2

the lions attacked again and the mother charged , putting her head down and barreling into a lioness			0
' this went on and on , backwards and forwards , with the lions attacking the buffalo relentlessly and the buffalo fiercely protecting their calf			2
' the atmosphere was electrifying , my nerves were shattered after it was all over			0
while i was trying to capture all the action , i was also silently rooting for the calf			0

' her pride followed hesitantly and the mother and her calf retreated to the safety of their herd ; the calf narrowly escaping to live another day			0
' the lions went hungry that morning , but were no doubt back to try their luck again the next day			0
it was extremely dramatic and emotional to watch , but this is everyday life in the @entity37 bush			1
