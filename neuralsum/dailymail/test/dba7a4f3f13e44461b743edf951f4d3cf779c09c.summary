@entity0 tonight backed the immediate transfer of all tax powers to @entity3 in a move that threatens a multi-billion pound cut to @entity7 's budget			1
the first minister was forced to admit her mps would vote for fiscal autonomy as early as next year , despite the catastrophic collapse in @entity13 oil revenues			1
such a move would leave a massive £ 7.6billion black hole in @entity7 's finances , triggering either higher taxes , deeper spending cuts or unsustainable borrowing levels			1
@entity0 said she would back calls for all tax powers to be devolved to @entity7 ' as soon as possible ' , but @entity23 leader @entity22 ( right ) warned this would leave a catastrophic hole in the country 's budget miss @entity0 struggled once again in a tv election clash screened by the @entity29 , just a day after she faced an audience backlash by refusing to rule out a snap second referendum on independence			1
she walked into a trap set by @entity23 leader @entity22 , who pointed out that one of the @entity36 's biggest supporters , billionaire @entity34 , admitted @entity7 is not ready for fiscal autonomy			1
but asked when she wants full tax powers , @entity38 said ' as soon as possible '			2
' as @entity7 's voice in the @entity41 , if the @entity36 is there in numbers we will be arguing for as many powers to come to @entity7 as quickly as possible , ' she said			1
' i would like it as quickly as the other parties agree to give it			1
' asked by @entity22 ' would your mps vote for it next year ? ' , the first minister replied : ' i would vote for it , would you support it ? ' to applause , the @entity23 leader swiftly responded : ' no i would n't			1
' absolutely not , and let me tell you why			0
this is the idea that we cut ourselves off from sources of taxation across the @entity62			0
miss @entity0 ( centre ) struggled slightly during a debate tonight in @entity65 ( pictured ) just a day after she was booed for refusing to rule out another referendum after the election gaining full fiscal autonomy from the rest of the @entity62 will likely leave @entity7 with a £ 7.6billion shortfall in cash , according to independent experts , after the value of @entity74 plunged earlier this year ' after the difficult time that @entity65 and the north east of @entity7 been through , the idea that we voluntarily give up the pooling and sharing of resources , the ability to transfer money across these islands - i do n't think it makes sense			1
' the debate was held in @entity88 's @entity87 , and was chaired by the @entity29 's @entity89 – who has been the victim of ' @entity91 ' abuse in recent days			2
@entity38 , mr @entity22 , @entity93 leader @entity92 and @entity95 leader @entity94 – who all took part in an @entity98 debate the previous night – were joined by @entity100 's only elected politician in @entity7 , mep @entity101 , and @entity7 @entity103 co-convener @entity102			1
during the one - hour clash : much of the debate focused on the @entity36 's support for ' full fiscal autonomy ' , which former first minister @entity108 has described as ' home rule ' and critics have branded ' independence by the back door '			2
it would see the devolution of every tax – including @entity13 oil revenues – and leave only defence and foreign affairs reserved to @entity119 , ending the generous @entity120 that funds @entity7			1
@entity122 official annual accounts show how @entity7 contributed £ 400 extra in taxes than the @entity62 average last year , but received an additional £ 1,200 in public spending			2
@entity7 @entity95 leader @entity94 ( left ) warned @entity38 against another referendum , while @entity7 @entity128 leader @entity102 ( right ) called for an end to @entity13 drilling last month , the highly - respected @entity131 ( @entity131 ) predicted that a ' fiscally autonomous ' @entity7 would have a massive £ 7.6billion black hole in its finances			1
that is the difference between the estimated budget deficit for the entire @entity62 in 2015 - 16 of 4 per cent of @entity136 ( gdp ) and @entity7 's budget deficit of 8.6 per cent			1
according to the independent @entity140 ( @entity140 ) , offshore revenues are expected to shrink to only £ 600million in 2016 - 17			0
that is a staggering 13 times smaller than the most optimistic figures @entity108 based his independence blueprint on			0
speaking after the debate , @entity93 leader @entity92 said @entity38 's election campaign is ' beginning to unravel '			1
one member of the audience warned the first minister that she ' does n't speak for everyone ' in @entity7			0
in the earlier stv debate on tuesday , @entity38 said next month 's general election is not a 're - run ' of the referendum , but pointedly said ' that 's another matter ' when asked about her @entity3 manifesto for 2016			1
her weak response was met with audible groans from the audience			0
@entity92 ( left ) , leader of the @entity7 conservatives , said @entity38 's election campaign was unravelling			1
@entity100 mep @entity101 was branded a ' disgrace ' by @entity0 during the show , the @entity36 leader insisted : ' i do accept the result of the referendum			1
there is a triple lock on this			0
' before it is inserted in the manifesto , public opinion has to change , and then people have to vote for the manifesto if it is in it , then people have to vote for independence			0
' pressed on whether the @entity93 would block another referendum , miss @entity92 said : ' i do not see an area where if the circumstances arose again that we would			1
' however , we would feel a betrayal very deeply when we were promised time after time by @entity0 , by [ deputy first minister ] @entity184 , by all her @entity185 , mps , @entity187 and councillors that this was ' once in a generation ' and we were told by the end of the campaign it was ' once in a lifetime '			2
' mr @entity22 said : ' you do n't get a mandate from an opinion poll , you get a mandate from a manifesto and you have gone from being a proud co-leader of the big @entity201 campaign to being the head of the ' maybes ayes , maybes naws ' campaign			2
' mr @entity94 said : ' just imagine if we had a different vote last september			1
' i think there would be blind panic as a result of what has happened in the @entity13			0
' @entity0 has got a nerve to continue to argue for a policy that was soundly trounced in the referendum			2
' @entity100 ’s @entity7 leader @entity101 was last night branded a ‘ disgrace ’ by @entity0 for comparing one of her ministers to convicted terrorist @entity218			1
the first minister rounded on the @entity187 after the @entity7 @entity221 revealed how he made the comparison when referring to @entity224 minister @entity223			2
mr @entity101 was also roundly booed by the audience in the @entity29 leaders ’ debate as he claimed ‘ open door immigration ’ has contributed to the rise in food banks , and demanded a cut in foreign aid because most of it ‘ goes to dictators ’			0
in a fierce exchange , @entity23 leader @entity22 told him : ' do n’t demonise immigrants			1
how dare you ? ' @entity92 best bit : a passionate defence of the @entity62 , describing it as a ‘ social union as well as a political union ’			0
key clash : a row with @entity0 over a second independence referendum , in which she warned that breaking the @entity36 ’s ‘ once - in - a - generation ’ promise would be a ‘ betrayal ’			1
worst bit : forced to concede that @entity119 would not stand in the way of another referendum if the @entity36 wins a majority			2
verdict : not quite as sure - footed as she was in tuesday ’s @entity98 debate , but her honesty with voters and passion for the @entity256 shone through			0
7/10 @entity0 best bit : branded @entity101 a ‘ disgrace ’ to his face for comparing @entity36 minister @entity223 to convicted terrorist @entity218			0
key clash : a battle with @entity22 over ‘ full fiscal autonomy ’ and what it would mean for @entity7 ’s budget			2
worst bit : admitted @entity36 mps would vote for full tax powers as soon as next year – coinciding with a dramatic slump in @entity13 oil revenues			1
verdict : unlike last week ’s @entity62 - wide debate , she struggled under scrutiny from her opponents , with full fiscal autonomy now a millstone around the @entity36 ’s neck			0
5/10 @entity22 best bit : vowed to fight to keep the @entity120 ‘ today , tomorrow and forever ’			0
key clash : took @entity101 to task for ‘ demonising ’ immigrants in an explosive confrontation that left the @entity100 leader in pieces			0
worst bit : forced to admit that a @entity23 government would make ‘ targeted ’ cuts , less than 24 hours after he claimed the party may not make any spending cuts			0
verdict : a commanding performance , forcing @entity0 to sign up to massive budget cuts for @entity7			2
8/10 @entity94 best bit : huge applause when he used self - deprecating humour to warn @entity0 against ‘ breaking a promise ’ that last year ’s referendum was a ‘ once - in - a - generation ’ vote			1
key clash : desperately tried to distance the @entity95 from their coalition partners during exchanges with @entity92			2
worst bit : squirmed over the @entity95 ’ broken promise not to increase tuition fees south of the @entity306			1
verdict : came out fighting after failing to make any impact in tuesday ’s debate , and delivered the best joke of the night			0
6/10 @entity102 best bit : won applause for accusing @entity100 of trying to ‘ cancel our membership of the civilised world ’			0
key clash : left looking foolish by presenter @entity89 , when asked if opposing ‘ capitalism ’ would be a ‘ red line ’ for @entity318			0
worst bit : telling an audience in @entity62 ’s oil capital the country must ‘ minimise extraction ’ of @entity13 reserves , jeopardising thousands of local jobs			1
verdict : @entity101 saved him from making the most ridiculous comments of the night , but his arguments were at the level of a sixth form school debate			0
2/10 @entity101 best bit : claimed @entity7 would have called in the @entity332 ( @entity332 ) by now if there had been a @entity201 vote in the referendum			2
key clash : clashed with every leader and the audience , and most of civilised society			0
worst bit : nearly every time he spoke			0
booed for blaming immigration for the rise food banks and claiming foreign aid mainly goes to ‘ dictators ’			0
verdict : arguably should have lost his job weeks ago when he compared a @entity224 minister to @entity218			0
added nothing to the debate			0
