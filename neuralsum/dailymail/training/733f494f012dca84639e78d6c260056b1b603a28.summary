in time , the current storm of unrest raging around the @entity3 team may serve a positive purpose			1
@entity5 believes that he and his players are finding out what the @entity7 will be like — 10 months early			1
as the tournament hosts trying to satisfy an expectant nation , demands will be sky - high and tolerance of failure extremely limited			2
there will be no allowances made for the age - profile of the team , or their lack of caps compared to leading rivals			2
in the harsh glare of the global showpiece in this country , the head coach knows that it is a case of deliver or be damned			2
@entity3 head coach @entity5 speaks to the assembled media at @entity27 on monday @entity5 looks pensive on the @entity29 pitch following his side 's 31 - 28 loss to the @entity32 that equation is already coming to pass during this @entity35 autumn series			1
@entity3 have been regrouping and developing and learning since @entity36 took charge in the aftermath of the last @entity7 , but now the time has come for positive momentum and it is eluding them			1
five defeats on the bounce is cause for alarm , no matter who the opposition and no matter how many untimely injuries			2
last saturday ’s defeat at the hands of @entity32 has acted as a tipping point			2
media criticism has been accompanied by sometimes ugly social - media barbs from disgruntled @entity55 supporters — with @entity56 particularly targeted on @entity57 after being sin - binned during the latest defeat			1
@entity59 , @entity3 are circling the wagons			1
@entity36 yesterday lifted the lid on his personal torment			0
the head coach has been the subject of largely positive commentary since replacing @entity67 , but he is feeling the heat as progress has stalled			0
@entity70 has not impressed in this autumn 's games , and @entity5 could be forced to experiment the @entity3 players are finding out the pressure of playing at home under extreme expectation ‘ it ’s hard to take , ’ he said			1
it hurts when you lose when you ’re @entity3 and it should do			1
it hurts me personally because i ’m responsible for the team and it hurts the players			0
no - one accepts it as part of the job because you do n’t want it to happen , but when it does come you ’ve just got to accept it for what it is			0
‘ more importantly , you have to make sure that you and all the other guys keep some perspective about what you ’re trying to do and what you ’re trying to achieve			0
it ’s when the pressure starts to affect the team that the problems begin			1
my sense is that we ’re disappointed with ourselves but we have to believe in what we ’re doing			0
’ @entity5 has been stung by the criticism and revealed that he finds it hard to escape from it			1
‘ it ’s not nice and it ’s not taken lightly , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s not very easy to tune out from it			0
my way of dealing with it is to look at the areas of the game that we could have controlled and done better and to understand why they happened			0
@entity5 has defended his team , but he may have to change his half - back combination to @entity119 and @entity120 ‘ secondly , but probably most important , it ’s about thinking about selection and thinking about who deserves an opportunity now and who perhaps does n’t deserve that opportunity			1
‘ that over-rides your mind , but also how you deal with the pressure that comes on the team , so that they become resilient to it			1
actually , we ’re going to have pressure on us when the @entity7 comes around , irrespective of the results leading up to it			2
@entity5 stressed his selction dilemas , and could pick @entity139 ( left ) or @entity140 against @entity141 ‘ that ’s what comes with the expectation of being the home nation , so we better get used to it			1
’ once again , @entity5 was at pains to emphasise the context of each defeat			1
he has been assailed by injuries and fixture clashes and form fluctuations among his leading men , but no test coach is immune from such trials and tribulations			0
@entity3 have the resources to cope with most adversity			1
in the past , @entity160 captain @entity159 has had to withstand fierce individual pressure but it is unfamiliar territory for @entity36			2
he has understandably shown signs of stress and strain			0
as ever , he is prepared to face the inquisition head - on , but the occasional terse reply shows how the pressure is affecting a naturally good - natured man			2
there is a sense of exasperation and indignation among @entity36 and his staff at some aspects of the criticism			0
captain @entity159 has been criticised in the past , but @entity5 is feeling the pressure for the first time on monday , when he was asked to address the revolving door of @entity3 midfield selection since the 2003 @entity7 , he quipped : ‘ i looked at those 39 centre partnerships but there ’s only about three of them that involved me			1
i do n’t see why i ’m culpable for the whole centre partnership conundrum			0
’ this period will serve as a major examination of his composure and man - management skills			0
the fur is flying and @entity36 must prove that he can initiate a revival			0
it is a difficult aspect of the role he signed up for but if this is a sign of what the @entity7 will be like , the man in charge of the host nation has to seize this awkward opportunity to show he can survive and thrive .			0

@entity3 have lost their last five games in a *row*
@entity5 is beginning to feel media pressure for first time
@entity3 must buck the trend against @entity141 and @entity212
