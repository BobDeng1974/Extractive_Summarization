and now the loved - up couple are celebrating 20 years of being together			0
@entity5 and @entity6 are now experts at ' selfies ' , but when they met , online dating was a new phenomenon and they had to ask friends to help them build an internet profile flashback : the couple on their wedding day after first getting together online ‘ we 're definitely one of the first ever dates and we believe we 're the first date that turned into a couple , ' said 72 - year - old @entity6			1
‘ when i first told my friends i was using the internet to find a boyfriend they were a bit anxious for me - because the internet itself was very new and online dating was unheard of ! ‘ but as soon as they met @entity5 they realised they did n't need to worry about anything			1
' although today 's online dating profiles are awash with dozens of perfect selfies , @entity6 's profile did n't even have a picture - as she did n't know how to upload one			1
' a friend had to help me set up the profile as the internet was very new , ' said @entity6 , a travel agent			1
many adventures : @entity5 and @entity6 enjoy a meal out , despite their first date in a restaurant not going to plan the couple quickly fell in love after meeting online ‘ i just about managed to get the profile done but a picture was an ask too far ! ‘ he only had my personality and description to go on when i turned up for our first date			1
' after a week of messaging , the pair decided to start chatting on the phone and after another week decided to meet in person			0
a retired engineer , @entity5 said he believed their meeting was fate			2
' i did n't know how i was going to get on with online dating - my picture was one of my better ones , ' said the 76 - year - old			0
‘ but as soon as i saw the lady walking in front of me i just knew it was @entity75			0
‘ i guess it was meant to be			0
’ @entity5 , determined to impress @entity6 , chose a @entity78 restaurant close to both of their homes and ordered the most expensive lobster dish on the menu			1
however , his idea of a romantic meal did n't go to plan when the bill came to more money than he had with him and @entity6 had to chip in five dollars to cover the shortfall			2
' it was n't an impressive first date at all , ' said @entity6 , ‘ but i wanted to go on a second date to make sure i got my five bucks back ! ’ their next date did n't go any better after @entity6 's perm went wrong and she tried to cancel their meeting scheduled for that weekend			2
when @entity5 said he did n't care what she looked like and arrived to pick her up anyway , @entity6 opened the door with a paper bag complete with holes cut out for her eyes and mouth			2
despite the awkward start , @entity6 and @entity5 soon started seeing each other regularly and after 18 moths , @entity5 moved into @entity75 's home , before they tied the knot 18 months later			2

' our wedding was charming , ' said @entity6			2
' it was in a restaurant and because we 're @entity119 we had a @entity120 and lots of traditional elements			0
' @entity123 only knows what would have happened if we had n't had @entity9 - i probably would have married someone boring from my bridge club			0
' at the time i just thought maybe it was time for me to get married so i started going out on dates and meeting people			0
’ partners through time : not only has the internet gone from strength to strength since 1995 , so has @entity5 and @entity6 's relationship the couple now have seven grandchildren between them ' i had been dating guys who were much younger but who acted like granddads so i decided to find someone my own age			1
' i did n't really go out to bars and parties so i thought i would try @entity9 " i was ready to give up and then he came along			0
. ' if i was advising women thinking about going online now , i 'd have to warn them that there are n't that many great guys like @entity5 out there ! ' @entity5 added : ' i feel so lucky to have met @entity6			1
we got onto @entity9 just at the right time			0
' i know it does n't work out for everyone , but it was perfect for us			0
