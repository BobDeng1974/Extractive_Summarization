the court heard that the @entity122 had a stormy relationship over many years			2
they are half brothers and @entity13 said his brother used to give him serious beatings and their mother viewed @entity13 as the ' golden boy ' of the family			1
there had been a major falling - out after @entity13 claimed his brother had slept with his girlfriend who was ' the only girl he ever loved ' and @entity17 or someone on his behalf had once shot him in the stomach			1

just a few hours later he armed himself and drove to mr @entity9 ’s house , entering through the unlocked conservatory door			0
he shot mr @entity9 once to the back of the head before leaving the house and driving off at speed			0

he said he had found his brother in bed with @entity55 and shot him			2

she said : ' i could n’t believe it			0
with him being in a car crash it could have been a haemorrhage or someone might have bashed him on the head			0

he said of @entity13 : ' he has always been a bum			2
nobody liked him , nobody ever has			0

he told @entity13 : ' you were so hyped up you scarcely noticed who you were shooting and mistook @entity9 for your brother			1
' you intended the cold - blooded execution of your brother and you carried out the cold - blooded execution of @entity9 against whom you had no grudge			1

sleeping woman and child in bed next to him did *n't* hear a sound as shotgun was held so close to his skull when it was fired
the intended target was actually the alleged shooter 's brother , as the two family *members* *shared* years of *animosity* and *violence*
gunman @entity13 now been jailed for life with minimum of 30 years for the ' cold - blooded execution '
