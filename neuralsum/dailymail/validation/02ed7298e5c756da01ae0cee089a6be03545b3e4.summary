an incredible finish produced two stoppage - time goals as @entity2 came from behind for a second time to rescue a point			1
no sooner had @entity5 put @entity6 2 - 1 in front than @entity2 substitute @entity8 plundered a point with almost the last kick			1
both goals came from close range			0
@entity5 was stupidly sent off after his , taking off his shirt in celebration to pick up a second yellow card within moments of each other			2
@entity8 celebrates after scoring an equaliser six minutes into injury time for @entity2 earlier , a goal disallowed after it had been awarded - and an amazing miss - beset @entity2 in their top two challenge			1
but they rallied to challenge strongly for all three at one stage			0
@entity24 was cautioned for handling the ball into the @entity6 after referee @entity26 had signalled a goal from the @entity2 first serious attack			2
late in the first half @entity29 somehow failed to make clean contact with the ball , let alone bury a sitter from six yards			0
the young striker fires home after @entity37 ' original effort was saved by @entity38 @entity6 : @entity38 ; @entity39 , @entity40 ( c ) , @entity41 , @entity42 ; @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 ( @entity47 ) ; @entity26 ( @entity48 - 78 ) , @entity5 subs not used : @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 booked : @entity41 red card : @entity5 95 goals : @entity26 54 , @entity5 95 @entity2 : @entity57 ; @entity58 , @entity59 ( c ) , @entity60 , @entity61 ; @entity62 , @entity63 ( @entity64 - 87 ) , @entity37 , @entity24 ( @entity65 - 67 ) ; @entity29 ( @entity66 - 78 ) , @entity67 subs not used : @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity73 - @entity72 booked : @entity24 , @entity59 , @entity8 goals : @entity65 67 , @entity64 96 in between times , @entity2 were stretched to stay on terms in a lively contest and eventually fell behind to @entity78 after the break			1
but substitute @entity65 slipped home from close range within five minutes of leaving the bench to round off a fine move triggered by @entity84			1
the @entity24 no - goal was a big talking point			2
he knocked the ball in almost on the line after @entity67 had headed goalwards from @entity84 's fine run and cross			0
there was no flag from assistant referee @entity93 but @entity26 was prompted to consult her amid strong @entity6 protests			0
the upshot was a booking for @entity24 whose team mate @entity67 was later lucky to escape at least a yellow for clattering over @entity39			0
@entity5 , albeit a handful , failed with at least two chances to punish @entity2 for whom keeper @entity57 also denied @entity45			1
@entity65 ( left ) fires home the first equaliser just minutes after coming on as a substitute but @entity26 struck with a smart turn on the edge of the box to smash home with @entity57 caught out of position			1
@entity53 , 19 year old grandson of the great @entity109 , was on the bench for @entity6 in his first call up to the senior squad			0
@entity114 's team were fighting a rearguard action in the last 20 minutes as a more fluent @entity2 found their rhythm			1
@entity24 ( centre right ) has a goal disallowed in the first half after handballing it into the net the quick and clever @entity84 was a constant source of danger down the right , forcing @entity125 to substitute left back @entity46			0
clearly manager @entity126 was in no mood to settle for a point as @entity2 looked to climb from fifth place			2
@entity2 appeals for a penalty were waved aside after @entity44 was suspected of handling in the box			2
the @entity6 players complain to the referee and @entity24 was then booked for his handball			0

@entity8 equalised for @entity2 after 96 minutes to save a point
former @entity139 @entity5 scored what he *thought* was the **win*ner* after 95 minutes and was then sent off for the home side
@entity78 gave the home side the lead before @entity65 scored
@entity2 lost ground on the @entity149 top two after failing to *win*
