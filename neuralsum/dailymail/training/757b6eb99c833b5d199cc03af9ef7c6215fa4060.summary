@entity1 scientists have embarked on a mission worthy of @entity3 – to save the world ’s chocolate supplies			1
with global demand for chocolate soaring and disease ravaging crops in the world ’s biggest cocoa - producing countries , the scientists are battling to develop hardier and more productive cocoa plants			1
the @entity13 has been given exclusive access to the epicentre of the @entity1 effort to save chocolate : a high - security £ 1 million greenhouse in @entity19			1
growing challenge : professor @entity21 at the @entity22 in @entity19 boom : the aim is to ensure global chocolate supply keeps up with growing demand			1
above , one specemine here , a team from @entity28 is hard at work on the project – dubbed ‘ @entity36 ’ after the character @entity3 in @entity34 ’s classic children ’s book @entity35			0
the ‘ @entity3 ’ of the operation is @entity21 , a professor of horticulture , who explains that the ‘ @entity42 ’ , or @entity22 , was set up to ensure that the global supply of chocolate can keep up with booming demand , which is being fuelled by the sweet - toothed @entity41			1
he said : ‘ our aim is to provide new genetic plant material for cocoa - producers which will help them by giving them better - quality and more productive cocoa beans			1
the drive is to find disease - resistant and highest yielding varieties			0
’ most of the chocolate eaten in @entity1 is made from cocoa beans produced in @entity57 and @entity58 in @entity59			1
but a virus called cocoa swollen shoot and an insect called a mirid are devastating crops there			2
inspiration : the project is dubbed ' @entity36 ' after the classic @entity34 character			0
above , @entity69 as @entity3 in 2005 prof @entity21 says the producers in @entity59 want to try new varieties grown in @entity72 and @entity73 , but they do n’t want to run the risk of introducing diseases and pests associated with those crops			0
‘ this is where we have a pivotal position , ’ added prof @entity21			0
‘ we receive a @entity83 variety and quarantine it here for three months to ensure it is disease - free			2
we then grow , observe and test the plants for two years , and when we are happy the variety is safe , we send a cutting to @entity57			2
‘ without this facility there is a real danger people might be tempted to sidestep the safe movement routes for plants and bring in a plant that could destroy their crops			2
’ in the 11,000 sq ft greenhouse in @entity19 , 400 different types of cocoa plant are being nurtured			1
the plants , which are between 7ft and 9ft tall , are arranged in rows in a polythene - roofed hothouse where temperatures are kept at tropical levels			0
more than 1,000 gallons of water a day are pumped over the plants by an automatic system and a close eye is kept on them for signs of disease			0
plants are also monitored for growth rates and pod yields			0
the ‘ chocolate factory ’ costs £ 160,000 a year to operate , with half of its funding provided by the @entity119 @entity118			0
the rest comes from the @entity122 ( @entity122 ) – a consortium of chocolate traders and manufacturers			0
@entity122 chairman @entity125 said : ‘ we are all very proud that @entity1 , a chocolate - loving nation , is taking on this important role to ensure a better future for cocoa - producers and chocolate supplies			1
