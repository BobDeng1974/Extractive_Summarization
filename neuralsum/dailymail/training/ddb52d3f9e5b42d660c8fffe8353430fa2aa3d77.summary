@entity4 gave me a job to do that i loved more than anything else			0
’ miss @entity2 told the @entity11 it was ‘ very likely ’ her next book will be for children			1
she has previously admitted that the pressure of following up the seven @entity4 novels led her to consider publishing @entity26 under a pseudonym , although she later decided that it would be ‘ braver ’ to be honest			1
@entity66 in the title role in the cinema adaptation of @entity69 : the series has made @entity71 a multi-millionairess miss @entity2 told the @entity11 that her life as a single mother in the early @entity75 informed much of the class issues in her latest opus , which she feels reflects the situation today in austerity - stricken @entity79			1
' i would say there 's a whiff of the early - @entity75 about the way these issues are being discussed right now			1
