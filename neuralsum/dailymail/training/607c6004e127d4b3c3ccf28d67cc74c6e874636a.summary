by @entity1 reporter published : 09:29 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 10:51 est , 8 august 2012 as @entity3 triumphantly raised her arms at the end of her gold medal - winning performance yesterday , the entire arena appeared to be cheering - except this guy			1
the grouchy gentleman may argue that he had the worst seat in the house during the women 's gymnastics floor exercise final , right behind @entity3 's jubilant parents			1
sporting a preppy look with a white t - shirt and a green sweater over his shoulders , he can not keep his exasperation a secret as @entity22 and @entity23 celebrate their daughter 's routine , which made her the first @entity26 woman to strike gold in the event			1
down in front : the spectator , pictured here between @entity3 's parents , shoots @entity23 an angry look as he cheers for his daughter golden girl : @entity3 won a gold medal in the women 's floor exercise final on tuesday , her second in @entity41 the parents ' merriment as their daughter completed the floor exercise for the gold medal was so unbearable to the crabby codger that he motions with his hands for them to sit down at one point			1
when that would n’t work , he could be seen burying his face in his hands in exasperation			0
it was @entity3 's second gold medal and her third overall in the @entity56			1
she picked up a bronze medal earlier in the day in the balance beam			0
though @entity3 has made a huge splash in @entity41 , her parents are in no way getting used to it			1
sit down : as @entity23 stands to get a better look at his daughter , the man can be seen waving his hand in an effort to get him to sit back down a hilarious video of the couple from the all - around qualification round on july 29 showed them contorting their bodies almost in sync with their daughter as she performed on the uneven bars			2
mrs @entity3 , a former gymnast herself , keeps repeating ‘ let ’s go ’ as she lurches to the side to get a better view			2
exasperated : as the @entity78 clap and cheer for their daughter , the man appears to give up sensation : though @entity3 has made a huge splash in @entity41 , her parents are in no way getting used to it and at the end the two both chant ‘ stick it ! stick it ! ’ and fist pump in the air as their daughter got a great score			1
the video of the @entity78 became an internet sensation - even though they claimed they were actually trying to be quiet so as not to distract @entity3			2
but their reaction was understandable as they have been planning @entity3 ’s success since she was 18 months old when mrs @entity3 took her to ‘ @entity100 ’ gym classes			0
hilarious : @entity3 's parents squirm and pull distressed faces as they watch their daughter 's routine distracting : @entity3 's parents winced and gasped as she performed on the uneven bars and support is so strong for the 18 - year - old her that 10 relatives have made the journey from their home in @entity114 , @entity115 , for the @entity41 games			1
in the 50 second video @entity117 and mrs @entity3 can be seen leaning over to their right as mrs @entity3 mouths to herself again and again : ‘ come on @entity3 , let ’s go ’			0

in an interview with @entity126 , mrs @entity3 admitted that she burst into tears when she saw the result			0
critical : mr and mrs @entity3 flinch and draw back in their seats workout : mrs @entity3 leans to her right as she mimics @entity3 's moves she said : ‘ i started crying … when she was in first place … there were many points that were overwhelming			2
‘ i kept saying , ‘ oh my gosh we ’re at the @entity142 , we ’re at the @entity142			0
’ so you wan na soak it in , but it ’s so nerve racking because you just want it for them so much			0
‘ because you know what they ’ve put into it and it ’s just unbelievable ’			0
relief : mr @entity23 whoops proudly as his daughter 's score is announced she also admitted that she does not even talk to her daughter before she competes any more			0
mrs @entity3 said : ‘ we were really close to the bars and i was like , nobody say anything to her , be really quiet			0
