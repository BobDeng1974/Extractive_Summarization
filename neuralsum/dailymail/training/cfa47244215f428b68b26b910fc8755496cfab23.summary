by @entity0 published : 13:55 est , 16 december 2012 updated : 13:57 est , 16 december 2012 this stunning scene could almost be mistaken for blossom floating on a river or lake at the end of an @entity6 summer - the reality is far more breathtaking and otherworldly than that			0
hundreds of flowers drift silently across the surface of the sea , but these are n't your average petals they in fact elaborate ice formations in the @entity18			0
the beautiful selection of snaps were shot last year by @entity22 graduate student @entity21 and his professor @entity23 as the pair worked on a project combining oceanography , microbiology , and planetary sciences in the central @entity29			1
the pair focused their study on the awe - inspiring frost flowers , a strange phenomenon where frost grows from imperfections in the surface ice amid extreme sub-zero temperatures			1
beautiful : hundreds of frost flowers in the central @entity29 other - worldly : the photographs of ice were taken last year by @entity22 graduate student @entity21 and his professor @entity23 while they worked on a study combining oceanography , microbiology , and planetary sciences breathtaking : frost flowers are a strange phenomenon where frost grows from imperfections in the surface ice amid extreme sub-zero temperatures nearing -22c or @entity54 , forming spiky structures that have been found to house microorganisms science : the pair were in the central @entity29 examining frost flowers as part of the @entity61 and @entity62 ( @entity63 ) program freezing conditions : @entity21 braves icy temperatures in the @entity29 sea to carry out experiments on frost flowers and ice cores cold : graduate student @entity21 handles a perfectly formed block of ice the flowers typically form in temperatures nearing -22c or @entity78 and their spiky structures have been known to house micro-organisms			1
similar to a coral reef , each flower is in essence a temporary ecosystem , with the bacteria found much more dense than in the frozen water below it			1
the pair 's research was part of the @entity61 and @entity62 ( @entity63 ) program			0
the research offers clues as to the limits of life in extreme temperatures which will be useful when we search on other ice - covered planets and moons for possible extraterrestrial life			2
the flowers were found to produce chemicals such as formaldehyde which could give clues about the origin of life on @entity107			0
although frost flower blooms are frequently observed in both polar oceans , little is understood about the physical , chemical and biological nature of the structures			0
to investigate their microbiology @entity21 and @entity23 learned to grow frost flowers in a freezer lab at the @entity22 before moving their study into the field , collecting frost flowers during several challenging expeditions			1
@entity21 and @entity23 are building a special chamber to grow frost flowers under ultra-clean conditions			2
digging deep : the scientists had to clear inches of snow to reach the sheets of ice to take samples tough terrain : the team used specialist vehicles to safely negotiate across the ice and snow supplies : @entity21 is pictured checking the equipment before taking on the field work on @entity139 in @entity140			0
