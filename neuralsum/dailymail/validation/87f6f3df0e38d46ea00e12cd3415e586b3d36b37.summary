apology : police officer @entity1 today said sorry for failing to admit that he ordered the gates at @entity3 to be opened the police chief on duty during the @entity3 disaster today apologised for lying to officials about ordering the gates to the stadium to be opened , leading to a deadly crush which killed 96 @entity12 fans			1
as the disaster unfolded , @entity1 told officials from the @entity13 that ' some fans have got in through a gate ' - which he admitted today was a ' terrible lie '			1
the former officer said that he ' apologised unreservedly ' for failing to confess that he had personally ordered police to open the gates in order to relieve overcrowding at the turnstiles of the @entity24 stadium			1
after the gates were opened fans rushed into the terraces , causing dozens of people to be crushed under the weight of bodies			1
mr @entity1 was the officer overseeing the @entity32 semi-final between @entity12 and @entity33 on april 15 , 1989 , even though he had been promoted just two weeks previously and had never been in charge of policing a football match before			1
yesterday he told the inquest into the fans ' deaths that he was ' not the best man for the job ' given his inexperience , and today he gave evidence about his decision to open @entity44 eight minutes before kick - off			1
after the gate opened an estimated 2,000 fans poured in , heading straight for a tunnel leading directly to the already - packed central pens three and four , behind the goal			1
mr @entity1 , 70 , today recounted a conversation he had with @entity13 officials @entity53 and @entity54 minutes after the match was abandoned amidst the chaos			1
he denied the suggestion that he had said the gates were ' stormed ' , and claimed he told the men ' something like , " some fans have got in through a gate			1
" ' he continued : ' i was pointing out that fans had gained unauthorised access to the ground			2
what i did n't say to mr @entity53 , i did n't say , " i have authorised the opening of the gates , " i did n't tell him that			2
' @entity70 , counsel for the inquest , asked : ' do you consider now that you told them a lie ? ' mr @entity1 replied : ' yes , ma'am			1
i certainly now appreciate it was wrong and completely open to misinterpretation			0
' he added : ' i was probably deeply ashamed , embarrassed , greatly distressed and i probably did n't want to admit to myself or anyone else , what the situation is			0
' what i would like to say the @entity12 families is this , i regret that omission and i shall regret it to my dying day			2
' i said something rather hurriedly , without considering the position , without thinking of the consequences and the trauma , the heartache and distress that the inference would have caused to those people who were already in a deep state of shock , who were distressed			0
' i apologise unreservedly to the families and i hope they believe it is a very , very sincere apology			0
' evidence : mr @entity1 pictured in the dock , where he talked about his actions on april 15 , 1989 relatives : campaigners @entity103 , left , and @entity104 , right , pictured outside the inquest asked if he was trying to hide the truth because he was responsible for the tragic events , mr @entity1 said : ' i think in a crisis , and probably in this shock and in stress , i said something i deeply regret			1
' i 'm a very honest person			0
i do n't tell lies			0
i set very , very high standards , not only in myself , but my colleagues in the service and my family			0
' no one , but no one can understand my behaviour that day - least of all me			0
that was a terrible lie , in that everybody knew the truth			1
' earlier mr @entity1 said he now realised ' in hindsight ' the ' most likely ' route fans would take once @entity44 was open was to go down the tunnel facing them and in to the central pens			1
miss @entity127 said : ' you say in hindsight you recognise that 's where a number of fans might have gone			0
do you think as a match commander the consequences of the decision you made , and in particular thought as to where the fans might go , is something you should have considered ? ' mr @entity1 replied : ' i think it is fair to say that is arguably one of the biggest regrets of my life , that i did not foresee where fans would go when they came in through the gates			1
' the commanding officer , who was stationed in the police control box with a bank of cctv monitors , said he was ' shocked ' at the request to open the gates from superintendent @entity155 after police became ' overwhelmed ' by the number of fans gathered at the turnstiles			1
crush : 96 @entity12 fans were killed by being pressed up against the ground 's perimeter fence mr @entity1 said : ' i do n't mind telling you i was shocked and taken aback by it and thinking , " where are these people going to go if i open the gates ? " ' he said another message then came through on the police radio from mr @entity155 saying : ' if we do n't open the gates someone 's going to get killed			1
' the witness continued : ' that really was a shocking , terrifying moment to feel you had got to that situation			0
' another officer in the police box , @entity180 , then said to him : ' are you going to open the gates ? ' the jury heard			2
mr @entity1 said : ' i remember saying to him quite clearly , mr @entity180 , if people are going to die i have no option but to open the gates			1
' he said he was left ' no option ' and thought fans would feel ' relief and comfort ' in being released from the crush of the turnstiles on to the concourse			2
mr @entity1 added : ' i think it 's fair to say i was overcome by the enormity of the situation and the decision i had to make			2
' and as a result of that i was so overcome , probably with the emotion of us having got into that situation , that my mind , for a moment , went blank			0
' mr @entity1 said there was ' every possibility ' that he panicked , and accepted that it was a mistake not to have taken steps to close the tunnel leading to the central pens			2
chaos : fans flooded onto the pitch in the aftermath of the disaster after climbing over perimeter fences the gate remained open for five minutes , allowing fans to flow into the ground , but the officer said today that he did not think about where those supporters would go			1
he admitted : ' it certainly was a mistake and an oversight			0
under the circumstances , with my limited ability , i accept it was a mistake - a mistake i should n't have made , a mistake i regret bitterly			0
' it was a grave mistake and i apologise profusely			0
' at 2.59pm , when the match kicked off , mr @entity1 said he looked towards the @entity228 terrace and had seen ' nothing untoward '			2
miss @entity127 suggested that it might have been ' obvious ' that fans were climbing out of the pens because of the number of people entering through @entity235 ' it was not obvious to me , ' mr @entity1 said			2
' i thought there may have been some crowd disorder or some problem and i was awaiting information			0
i did n't know what to think			0
i was looking and waiting for information			0
' asked when he had realised that something was badly wrong , the officer said : ' i have a recollection that a young man came from the perimeter track behind the goal and either collapsed or fell down			0
' he was hobbling , i remember seeing him hobbling , and there was a sudden realisation that this was not a pitch invasion , this was a serious situation			0
' the hearing continues tomorrow , when mr @entity1 will be questioned by a lawyer representing victims ' families			2

@entity1 , 70 , was in charge of the stadium on the day of disaster
he ordered gates to be opened to relieve overcrowding , but this led to thousands of fans flooding on to the terraces causing a *massive* crush
officer told @entity13 officials the fans had ' got in through a gate '
today he admitted that was a ' terrible lie ' and apologised for his actions
