by @entity0 published : 11:40 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 12:36 est , 24 may 2013 media mogul @entity1 faces up to five years in jail if found guilty of politically - motivated hooliganism @entity6 president @entity5 wants @entity1 ' punished ' claimed a witness in the media magnate 's trial today			1
the tycoon faces up to five years in a grim @entity6 prison if convicted of ' hooliganism motivated by political hatred ' for hitting a property tycoon in a television talk show 20 months ago			1
the suggestion that @entity5 was seeking harsh treatment for @entity1 - whose family own the @entity20 titles and the @entity21 , and who controls a @entity6 investigative newspaper - came on a day of angry , heated exchanges in a @entity26 court			1
' i remember @entity5 said on air that it is hooliganism , it must be punished , ' so - called expert witness @entity30 , an academic , told the court			2
' i ca n't agree more			0
if , yet again , such action is not punished , it means @entity6 is going to hell			0
' the reference to @entity5 is highly significant because critics claim that by labelling the fracas between @entity1 and @entity39 as ' hooliganism ' , the @entity6 president - speaking three days after the incident - was discreetly issuing an order that legal action should be taken against the media owner with whom he once served as a @entity46 spy			1
the @entity47 has denied interfering in court cases and his only known public comment on the incident does not directly demand punishment for @entity1			2
@entity52 also insisted @entity1 struck mogul @entity39 , 40 , with ' three punches '			1
this is disputed by the defence which claims the media owner pushed @entity39			1
if the court finds there were indeed three strikes , and that they were based on @entity1 's ' political hatred ' of @entity39 , it would open the way for the judge to impose a lengthy jail term under @entity6 law			1
charge : @entity1 is accused of politically - motivated ' hooliganism ' after punching @entity39 on @entity6 television ' there were three punches , ' said @entity52 , who claimed he was a ' culturalogist ' and is vice-president of the @entity71 and co-operation among the @entity73			1
' some minutes before the physical attack i noticed @entity1 massaging his fingers			2
it is normally done when the fighter has already decided to attack , ' he claimed			0
@entity1 's team disputed @entity52 's status as an ' expert ' or his right to give evidence , claiming he had no proof of a string of academic qualifications he claimed to hold			2
they accused him of ' lying to the court ' and last night @entity1 alleged that @entity52 last year sought to launch a police probe against him			0
if true , the judge said it could nullify @entity52 's evidence			0
it was claimed in court today @entity5 is seeking harsh treatment for @entity1 and wants him ' punished ' he did not directly witness the alleged punches but saw the show on tv			0
at one point today @entity1 's lawyer @entity99 claimed ' the trial is turning into a farce ' and the judge responded ' i have started thinking so too ' , though it was unclear to what he was referring			1
a succession of witnesses have failed to turn up at the trial to give evidence against @entity1 amid signs of bungling by the prosecutors			1
in a positive move for 53 year old @entity1 , the judge refused to accept written evidence from @entity39 because it was not certified by the @entity6 consul in @entity118 where he is on bail for allegedly assaulting and kidnapping a group of sailors			1
another @entity1 lawyer , @entity122 , said @entity39 must be made to appear in person at the trial , and raised doubts over whether he is , in fact , in @entity118 , as he informed the court			1
' his testimony is needed in order to investigate the truth , ' said @entity122			0
' @entity1 is accused of hooliganism based on political hatred			2
it is still not clear at all what political disagreement we are talking about all the time			0
' only @entity39 can explain the gist of this political hatred , when it began and what it was about , this is why we demand to make him come to @entity6 and take part			0
' on trial : @entity1 , right , talks to his lawyer @entity99 , centre , alongside his wife @entity144 , left , during a break in proceedings he warned @entity1 's rights to a fair trial would be jeopardised if he could not question is accuser			2
@entity5 's only known quote on the subject does not call for @entity1 to be punished but states : ' they are punching each other in the ears			0
imagine how they fight for money			0
they can gnaw each other 's throats			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
