keep on rolling : @entity13 , 81 , outside his home in @entity39 , @entity40 ' to go right through the bunch , if you like , and to get to the top by a @entity44 is great			1
' it ca n't get any better , can it ? ' speaking at his home in @entity39 , @entity40 , where he still rides his bike regularly , mr @entity13 rejected any suggestion that modern cyclists had an easier ride than those of his generation			1
' i do n't think so , no , ' he said			2
' riding the bike is riding the bike			0
no matter how good the bike is , you 've still got to push it			0
