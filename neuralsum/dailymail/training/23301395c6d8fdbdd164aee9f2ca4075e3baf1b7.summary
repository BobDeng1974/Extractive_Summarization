listening intently to the music played out through underwater speakers , they exercised their tremendous breath control , knowing execution is crucial to their success			0
double crab : @entity23 's team compete in the team free routine final during the synchronised swimming competition dancing on water : as their glamourous costumes glistened in the water today , the @entity2 synchronised swimmers made their sport look deceptively graceful from the poolside graceful : one of the @entity23 competitors back flips through the water elegantly mid-flight : a synchronised swimmier representing @entity36 flies through the air like a bird perfection : the team from @entity41 hold a pose in the pool			1
the @entity41 won a silver medal earlier in the week and are hotly tipped to be amongst the medalists once again synchronised swimming is one of two @entity2 disciplines contested only by women - the other is rhythmic gymnastics			1
after a closely - fought battle @entity53 's synchronised swimmers swept to gold today with an impeccably executed team routine punctuated by military drumbeats and spectacular acrobatic jumps , marking their fourth consecutive clean sweep at the @entity60			1
@entity41 , an emerging force in the sport , pipped @entity23 to claim silver			1
the @entity53 , who have won every duet and team gold since the @entity60 , scored 98.93 points out of a possible 100 for their ' free ' routine , a sequence which is not prescribed and in which swimmers show off their creative and technical skills			1

@entity23 , silver medallists in the duet segment , were denied second spot by a fractionally lower synchronisation score than their @entity41 rivals , despite an ocean - inspired routine - swimmers in fish - scale suits - that had the crowd roaring approval at movements imitating crab pincers and ocean waves			1
@entity92 missed out on the podium , ending the @entity60 without a synchronised swimming medal for the first time since the sport was introduced at the @entity2 in 1984			1
underwater fun : @entity118 's team are seen underwater as they perform in the @entity119 all together : @entity121 's team line up and point their toes in the air as they do a scissor moment in their routine @entity127 's synchronised swimmers today came in sixth place in their first ever @entity2 , meeting the target set by their coach			1

@entity135 , 23 , said she was pleased with how the ground - breaking team had done			2
' it was an incredible performance , all our highlights functioned and we really felt as a team underwater			2
hearing the crowd cheering , supporting us the whole way , really gives you the boost to perform that much more			0
' dress to impress : the costumes of all the competitors were deigned to glisten in the water and be eye - catching determined : precision and strength are both key skills for competitors in the sport success : @entity41 have shown dramatic improvement under @entity92 - born coach @entity91 , known as the ' mother of synchro ' and scored 194.01 points to take the country 's first silver in the sport the eight - strong @entity161 team , pinning their medal hopes on @entity163 , could not compete with the all - conquering @entity53 team , who won gold today having done the same in @entity168			1
@entity41 took silver and @entity23 bronze			2
@entity171 , 24 , was also upbeat about the final result			0
' it was a really strong performance , all our highlights worked and we got a really good score			0
' we 've shown how strong we are and we 've improved so much over the last few years			0
it stands us in good stead for the future			0
' @entity161 synchronised swimming was given a marked boost in 2007 , with lottery funding granted after the successful bid for the @entity184			2
@entity127 show a team effort as they hold one of their competitors in the air they are using their strength , endurance and flexibility to ensure their movements flow against the backdrop of the aqua blue water at the @entity13 @entity199 , 21 , said this was vital to the team , who were able to bring in @entity121 coach @entity203			2
she said : ' it 's made a huge difference			2
we 've been able to bring in @entity207 , get the best coaches in the world , bring in their ideas and knowledge			0
we 've centralised as well , training eight hours a day together every day and that 's played a big part			0
' the team are now focused on next year 's @entity215 and beyond that , the 2016 @entity2 in @entity163			2
@entity203 said : ' we have a couple of competitions this year , then it 's preparing for the @entity215 in @entity220			0
we just want to keep building up			0
' for us the weakest thing is artistic , that 's what we really need to step up on in the future			0
that 's what our lowest score was here , for the artistic side , so that 's what we really want to work on			0
' it 's a really young group , the oldest is 24 and the youngest is 18			0
so now it 's onwards to @entity163			0
' smiles all round : @entity118 beam as they take to the water skill : the sport requires competitors to hold their beneath for long periods under the water unity : the @entity121 team put on a show of underwater elegance much to the delight of the @entity246 crowds at the @entity13 not rusty : the @entity23 team dazzled the @entity246 crowds with their metallic style costumes toe - curling : the @entity53 girls try to hold a pose in the synchronised swimming despite some members of the team clearly having their faces submerged @entity255 : the @entity36 synchro team - as seen from above - clearly enjoyed themselves in the pool despite the strenuous activity high hopes : @entity53 had already won gold in the synchronised swimming duet segment earlier this week going for gold : @entity127 's team concentrate on their moves in the final best foot forward : @entity121 show their moves in their fluorescent pink costumes			1
