the memory sticks were full of photographs , and it expert and photography enthusiast @entity8 quickly realised how precious the images could be and determined to find the owner			1
amazing : @entity8 managed use technology to track down the photos ' owner half way across the world technology : when @entity8 put this picture in , it matched to a woman called @entity28 - who would eventually turn out to be the owner of the photographs so he set about selecting images and running them through @entity33 image search , trying to get the perfect match			2
and his hard work paid off , when he managed to find the name @entity28			0
but even with the unusual name , he was still struggling to find the mystery owner			0
' none of the names was @entity28 , so i went onto @entity42 and trawled through some of the photographs of people with that name to see if i recognised anyone from the pictures , ' he explained			0
' then i went back to the usb stick and looked at some of the documents on it and found the surname @entity54			0
' i typed that in @entity42 and a lady called @entity54 , from @entity56 , came up and i managed to positively identify her			0
' @entity28 , it transpired , was a teacher now living in @entity59 - almost 4,000 miles from @entity8 's home in @entity61			1
extra : @entity8 then turned back to the usb sticks to find more information , and then found a surname then he hit another hurdle : he sent a message to @entity28 , to let her know he had found her photos			1
but she did n't respond , so he did a little more sleuthing work and found a friend who was willing to help			0
and finally , he was able get the pictures back to their rightful owner , who is said to be ' absolutely delighted '			1
@entity28 sent @entity8 a thank you message saying that she believes she lost the sticks possibly on a visit to @entity78 in 2013			2
it said : ' thank you so much for getting my pics back to me ! i lost my bag with the usbs in it in @entity78 two years ago - or so i thought			1
' we probably stopped at other places as well but i 'm not that familiar with the area			0
' amazing that after two years you got it back to me i 'm now in @entity89 , and most of the photos were taken in @entity92 and @entity59 , and the @entity89 , where i 've been teaching			2
' thanks to you i 'll have my memories ! ' @entity8 is equally as pleased			2
