by @entity0 published : 16:15 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 16:15 est , 12 june 2013 this is it - the end			1
i imagine the scissors , now mere centimetres from my neck , making a sound like the rush of a guillotine blade			2
for i am about to lose , if not my head , then the signature style that has defined me for the past 15 years			1
my shoulder - length , honey - coloured tresses			1
' stop ! ' i squeal			2
the long and short of it : an initially dubious @entity0 now loves her pixie cut but it is too late			1
my life in hair flashes before my eyes : how i used to stroke it like a beloved pet when i was 13 and it had finally grown enough for me to tease it into a pinned - up style ; how i loved using hot rollers when i was 17 in an attempt to look like @entity29 actress @entity28			1
so when i eventually look down and see my luscious locks on the floor , i think for one crazy moment something inside me has been murdered			2
' it 's better to get it over with quickly , ' says @entity35 , my brilliant hairdresser from the @entity37 salon in @entity38 , @entity39			1
i 've long been visiting @entity35 for haircuts , and the @entity41 and @entity42 get their coiffures tended to here , too			0
but neither of them have done anything so drastic as to have the @entity50 pixie crop			0
so what on earth possessed me ? well , it was n't fashion , despite the popularity of actress @entity50 's crop , which she had done for her role in the film @entity58			1
no , my decision was based on crude practicalities			0
for a start , my hair makes me late			1
on a holiday to @entity64 , where the climate is devastating to long , frizzy hair like mine , i struggled with a hairdryer , hot irons and a heap of products to tame it into a semblance of a style every evening			1
' have you never thought of cutting your hair ? ' asked my travelling companion , who 'd just waited an hour for me to turn up for dinner			1
top of the crops : @entity50 's pixie crop has become one of the top ten most copied celebrity hairstyles i knew she was joking			1
but before i 'd left @entity39 , a male friend said : ' i like you best with you hair tied back , like a boy			1
' i had been mildly annoyed ; now i wondered if he actually had a point			0
so when i returned to @entity39 , i confessed to a couple of friends that i was thinking of cutting it all off			0
they told me to go for it - after four glasses of wine			1
that 's when i broke the first rule of tonsorial decision - making : never text your hairdresser when drunk			1
the next morning i find myself , sweating , having a ' consultation ' with @entity35			0
' right , ' she says			0
' i was thinking @entity50			0
' @entity35 has been cutting my hair for 15 years and has been itching to chop it short for ages			1
but a pixie crop ? firstly , i worry that i 'll look more gruesome than gamine			0
my bone structure is good , but it 's not classical like @entity50 's			1
my nose has a bump in the middle - will such an unforgiving cut accentuate it ? secondly , i worry i 'll lose my sex appeal			1
do n't men love long , tangled hair that they can use to drag you back to their caves ? in the @entity121 , @entity123 queens , no matter what they really looked like , were automatically endowed by painters and poets with very long , fair hair			1
the length indicated fertility and the light colour virtue			1
i had the length and the colour if not the virtue			1
so why did i want to lose those as well ? @entity35 ignores my tortured bleating and says she believes long hair is not the most flattering style for women over 35			1
she says it pulls down the face , making it appear older			0
short hair will ' take years off you '			1
@entity35 does n't even wash my hair before she begins to chop - apparently that gives people too much time to change their mind when going for something this drastic			1
' i feel the back of my neck : there is nothing there			0
i recall @entity155 's line in the 1942 film @entity157			1
he finds out both his legs have been amputated and duly cries : " where 's the rest of me ? " ' she turns my chair away from the mirror			1
' no peeking till it 's ready , ' she says , clearly worried i might faint from shock			1
then i am shampooed and my hair combed , parted and cropped with a small blade that brushes the back of my neck			1
i feel the back of my neck : there is nothing there			0
i recall @entity155 's line in the 1942 film @entity157			1
he finds out both his legs have been amputated and duly cries : ' where 's the rest of me ? ' @entity35 begins to blowdry what 's left of me			1
it used to take me at least 25			0
by this time i 'm almost sobbing			1
i realise that such a drastic change in hairstyle will require a whole new way of life			0
during the day , i almost never wear make - up because i can hide behind my hair			1
if my eyes are puffy , i simply shake some tendrils over them			0
if i get a spot on my forehead , i 'll artfully pin my hair to cover it			2
now i 'll need to wear lots of make - up at all times			2
i 'll need a new wardrobe , too			0
with a pixie crop , pared - down elegance is crucial			2
think @entity194 - style silk @entity192 and fitted tops			1
but while i 'll save money on all those anti-frizz hair - styling products , my new wardrobe and enhanced make - up collection will cost another Â£ 2,000 at least			1
oh lord ! ' you can look now , ' @entity35 cries			0
i do not recognise the face staring back at me			0
my nose seems longer and larger			0
for one awful moment , i think i look like @entity205			0
on the plus side , my eyes appear bigger and my cheekbones higher			0
in fact , i have n't seen my cheekbones for years - they were always hidden by hair			1
' @entity211 , ' i say feebly trying to seem happier than i am			0
i go to the bathroom and apply thick black eyeliner in a vain imitation of @entity215			0
when i add a slick of lipstick , i do feel a little better			0
while i look nothing like @entity50 , i do look younger by at least five years			0
meanwhile , @entity35 is ecstatic			0
' it 's wonderful ! ' she gushes , ' it really suits you			2
' my mother 's reaction is surprisingly enthusiastic , too			2
' that 's nice , darling			2
i never noticed what a long neck you had before			0
' cute cut : getting the chop can be nerve - wracking , but ultimately refreshing still , i go out food shopping in dark glasses and a cap			2
no one recognises me , not even the butcher i owe money to			0
the following morning i have a coffee appointment with an old male friend			0
' when did you do that ? ' the blood in my veins turns cold			0
it 's taken years off you , ' he continues			2
my spirits begin to rise			0
another friend says i look ' fresher '			0
then i test it on a date with a man i 've been seeing for a while			0
nervously , i put on lashings of black eyeliner and flick my hair up at the ends			2
even with the agonising about clothes and make - up , it takes me only 15 minutes to get ready			2
gone is the need for backcombing , tonging and spraying my hair			2
when my date sees me , he hollers : ' hey , you 're on time			2
what happened ? ' i point to my hair			2
' well it was about time you did something with it			2
your hair looked like an unmade bed			2
now you look sort of cute			0
' cute ? i ca n't help but be thrilled			0
i have n't been called that since i was 22			0
perhaps my pixie cut is n't so hair - raising after all .			1

@entity0 's shoulder - length hair do defined her signature style
but *maintaining* it was time - *intensive* , so she got the lop !
