president @entity1 's most secretive and controversial adviser is n't going anywhere , despite six years of whisper campaigns and public derision offered up by @entity5			1
@entity6 , the onetime aide to then - @entity8 mayor @entity7 , was introduced to @entity1 by a young staffer then named @entity10			1
in short order she had the future leader of the free world 's future plans mapped out and underway			2
it does n't help her public image that she was born in @entity17 , albeit to @entity19 parents			2
or that she 's unelected and has never faced the @entity21 confirmation process			2
but @entity19 presidents have broad discretion to appoint their own advisers , and @entity25 now says she 'll ' stay until the lights go off			0
' @entity27 : during a july 2014 broadcast interview with @entity29 , @entity25 showed off her office – including a picture frame decorated with figurines bowing to her obama - @entity35 : @entity25 is the president 's closest adviser but has never faced an election or a @entity21 confirmation vote the @entity39 interviewed @entity25 for a feature published on friday , hearing her say that her relationship to @entity1 is nothing like the famously cozy one between former president @entity44 and vice presdient @entity45			1
' please do n't say that			2
stop right there , ' she insisted			0
' the president listens to people who have interesting things to say – that could be the most junior person on the staff or it could be a senior adviser or it could be a person who whispers something to him across a rope line			1
' there 's nothing new about close advisers in the @entity63 , not even with the spacious @entity65 office @entity25 has occupied since 2009			0
' night - @entity73 ' : @entity25 has access to both the @entity65 and the upstairs presidential residence , drawing resentment from other senior staff but a @entity5 congressional staffer who requested anonymity spoke frankly about @entity25 on friday , telling @entity80 that she ' is clearly @entity1 's @entity81 , subtlely steering the ship of state			1
' ' @entity6 has the kind of influence on the federal government that the @entity88 was designed to prevent , ' the staffer said			1
@entity89 once reported on quiet discussions with an unnamed former @entity1 administration official who explained aides ' resentment of her all - hours access status with the first family – a situation that has earned her the nickname ' the night stalker			1
' ' it ’s pretty toxic , ' the official said			0
' she went to whatever meeting she wanted to go to – basically all of them – and then would go and whisper to the president			1
or at least everyone believed she did			0
... people do n’t trust the process			0
they think she ’s a spy			0
' @entity25 told the @entity109 that having @entity1 's ear and knowing his instincts ' initially it probably made people a little uncomfortable , ' but ' i think that has faded			1
i just want to do my job , and part of my job for the president is to be his friend			2
' ' whatever meeting she wanted ' : @entity25 reportedly has carte blanche to sit in with @entity1 wherever and whenever she chooses – including this february 2014 sit - down with business leaders where she sat closer to the president than former secretary of state @entity128 ' @entity130 ' : a @entity5 congressional aide likened @entity25 to @entity81 , the mystical @entity132 faith healer who earned the nickname ' mad monk ' as he wielded influence over @entity136 and his wife what has n't faded is the @entity140 - wide perception that she has outsize influence			1
recent books and @entity63 interviews have fed that fire more oxygen			0
in his book ' leading from behind , ' noted terrorism expert and multiple @entity109 best - selling author @entity150 reported that the president called off – three times – a planned the @entity154 raid that killed @entity156 mastermind @entity155			2
it was @entity25 who persuaded him to step back each time , according to @entity150 's sources			0
the @entity63 later denied his account			0
and @entity161 , whose book ' @entity163 ' traced the arc of a decade - long rivalry between the @entity166 and the @entity167 , said wednesday on the @entity168 that the @entity63 – not scheming @entity5 – is behind the swirling scandal over @entity171 's secret email server			1
@entity161 cited sources who told him @entity25 and @entity1 are jointly behind it since neither wants sto see mrs. @entity171 measuring the @entity175 's drapes			1
@entity63 staffers , he told @entity168 , are seeing ' tons of documents being wheeled through the corridors from @entity67 ’s old offices , and they ’re going through these looking for problems on her expense account , on her dealings with foreign leaders			0
' ' all of this , i ’m told , is prompted by @entity6 and the president , who do not want to see @entity171 president of the @entity19 , ' @entity161 said			1
excuse ? @entity25 explanied away the bow - to - me photo frame on @entity192 in a profile published during @entity1 's first year in office , the president told @entity196 that ' @entity6 is one of my oldest friends			1
over time , i think our relationship evolved to the point where she 's like a sibling to me ... i trust her completely			0
' he trusts @entity25 , he said , ' to speak for me , particularly when we 're dealing with delicate issues			0
' @entity1 also trusts her , it seems , to give tv interviews like the one she granted @entity209 last july			2
her message , though , was overshadowed by a camera shot of a framed photo of herself of a bookshelf – complete with three figurines posed bowing in homage to her image			0
@entity25 later fell back on a tweet claiming it was ' a gag gift			0

@entity6 helped *launch* the president 's *political* career in @entity8 is never far from the @entity166
a @entity5 congressional aide says she ' @entity1 's @entity81 , subtlely steering the ship of state '
seen as @entity1 's top *domestic* *policy* adviser , is often pictured closest to him and has a vote on *cabinet* appointments
helped decide to send *attorney* general @entity233 to @entity234 , @entity235 – in a *conversation* that @entity233 was n't a part of
