no sooner had the players finished their lap of honour than the work began through the night to turn @entity4 into a venue fit for a grudge match			1
they will bay for blood when @entity7 and @entity8 collide but @entity11 skipped off on their @entity13 adventure with frivolity in the air			1
there were paper planes , @entity19 waves and beach balls bobbing in the stands			2
very few of those present expect @entity22 and his team to return with the trophy , but @entity13 is the home of carnival and most were ready to commit to the spirit			2
thirty years ago , @entity11 fans would have been ready to perform their own tribute to the @entity13 riots			1
there has been a huge change in the demographic and a change in expectations			2
on friday night the crowd were unfailingly positive , and they were rewarded with goals			1
this is @entity22 ’s @entity51 , his new wave			2
‘ @entity55 ’ said the front of the match - day programme			2
the @entity11 manager addressed the crowd pre-match from the big screens behind each goal			1
@entity22 and his lions , off to the jungle saddling supporters of a certain generation with a ‘ @entity70 ’ tune in their heads , even if lions do n’t live in the jungle			0
the steamy rainforest climate , however , seemed a long way off on a cool may evening			0
fans watched in hats and scarves but @entity77 still infiltrated @entity4			1
pensive : @entity11 manager @entity22 looks on as he watches his side beat @entity37 3 - 0 plane sailing : @entity11 goalkeeper @entity81 throws a paper aeroplane after it landed on the pitch there was the samba band before kick - off and of course the @entity87 , intent on giving @entity11 a tough pre-tournament test			1
@entity11 were preparing for a @entity90 in @entity91 when they last played @entity37			1
that was in @entity93 in 1962 and @entity94 scored a hat - trick in a 4 - 0 win			0
the aim on friday night was the same			0
@entity22 wanted his players to sample the rhythms of @entity77 opponents , to tackle some of the inevitable frustrations that come with football on that continent			0
@entity105 ’s reckless assault on @entity29 might not have attracted attention in the ’ 62 @entity90 but he was rightly booked on friday night			1
@entity29 climbed to his feet and shook his head , unimpressed			0
crunching challenge : @entity37 's @entity105 ( bottom left ) goes in hard on @entity11 captain @entity29 it was not a warm - up - friendly sort of tackle , but it was a timely reminder that @entity11 need their captain fit and healthy for several reasons			1
on his 34th birthday , winning cap no 110 , he is close to irreplaceable as a leader and a holding midfielder			0
here was a lesson in patience			0
do not lose the plot when a team defends deep and with resolve			0
do not react when on the receiving end of a hefty midfield challenge			0
@entity127 and @entity128 have cracked in the past and seen red			0
@entity37 broke up play , interfered with @entity11 ’s tempo and threatened on the break			1
@entity22 looked on and rubbed his chin			0
he had , by his own admission , talked a lot over the last couple of weeks			0
had any of it sunk in ? maybe			0
@entity22 allowed himself an air - punch of delight when @entity140 curled in a left - footer from the edge of the area			2
in the air : @entity140 ( 2nd right ) points to the sky after scoring for @entity11 at @entity4 @entity11 took control in the last half - hour			1
@entity148 offered glimpses of the invention which has added creativity to this team			0
the set - pieces proved successful			0
and the @entity155 scouts in the crowd , filmed occasionally on their phones and scribbled when @entity11 went forward			1
they will be confident of defending the set - pieces better than @entity37 did			1
and while the support was impressive , they probably will not be too in awe of anything they saw on the pitch			2
powering through : @entity11 's @entity148 ( right ) evades the challenge of @entity37 's @entity165			1

@entity11 skipped off on their @entity90 adventure with frivolity in the air
the @entity4 crowd were unfailingly positive during the friendly against @entity37
the @entity155 scouts will probably not be too in awe of anything they saw on the pitch
