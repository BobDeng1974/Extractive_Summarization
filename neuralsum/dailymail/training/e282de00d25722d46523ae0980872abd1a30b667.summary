@entity0 is facing poll numbers that are now in the same territory as president @entity4 's following @entity3			1
the @entity5 released numbers on tuesday showing that just 38 per cent of registered voters approve of the job @entity0 is doing as president , with a whopping 56 per cent saying they disapprove			1
the president has lost his landslide electoral edge among young voters , too , with a negative 41 – 49 per cent rating among 18 - to 29 - year - old voters			1
his once formidable support among @entity15 has also evaporated : they now support him by an historically small 50 – 43 per cent margin			1
worse for @entity0 's fast - approaching legacy - building years , the public believes he is not ' honest and trustworthy , ' by a 52 – 44 per cent score			1
a smaller majority , 51 per cent , said he lacks ' strong leadership qualities			1
' respondents said by a 41 – 38 per cent gap that they would vote for a @entity25 over a @entity26 for the @entity28 @entity27 , the first time this year @entity30 have had a winning posture in the @entity5 poll			0
friendlier shores : @entity0 got a rousing ovation from a crowd attending the official memorial service for late @entity38 president @entity37 on tuesday , a change of pace from @entity28 who are losing faith in his policies majority leader ? @entity45 , the leader of the @entity47 's @entity25 minority , would run @entity49 ' upper chamber in 2015 if the public 's feelings about who should run the @entity53 hold up and 47 per cent of voters said they would like to see @entity55 gain control of both houses of @entity49			1
the @entity25 can achieve that outcome if it holds the @entity27 and picks up seven @entity47 seats in november 2014			0
fully half of independent voters – those aligned with neither the @entity30 nor the @entity25 – said they would back a @entity49 completely under @entity25 control			2
' president @entity0 could be pretty lonely during his last two years in office if voters decide they want @entity25 majorities in the @entity27 and @entity47 , ' said @entity5 assistant director @entity67			2
but @entity49 has n't had an easy ride either : 74 per cent of voters disapprove of the way @entity55 are doing their jobs			1
a smaller 67 per cent group says democrats in @entity49 are also falling shirt of the mark			0
exhibit a : @entity78 secretary @entity77 is presiding over a health insurance overhaul that has drawn catcalls and sighs from the public as its website flails and its sticker shocks hit home pollsters interviewed nearly 2,700 voters between dec. 3 and dec. 9 , asking their opinions after a spate of positive news hit tv broadcasts and internet news portals about jobs and the economy			0
the results suggest the staying power of @entity0 's unpopular health insurance overhaul and his administration 's controversial nuclear deal with @entity99			2
even @entity30 are beginning to doubt the president who famously promised hope and change : 18 per cent of them now say they 're no fans of @entity0 's work in the @entity106			1
@entity107 called the news ' a rousing chorus of @entity110 ! humbug ! for president @entity0 as @entity28 voters head into the holidays with little charitable to say			1
' that includes his handling of specific issues			0
while @entity0 enjoys a 50 – 41 per cent positive rating for his handling of terrorism , that 's the only issue @entity5 polled where he comes out on top			2
he 's under water on the economy , 37 – 59 per cent , 34 – 62 percent on health care and 42 – 49 per cent on foreign policy			0
@entity99 , too , is making @entity28 uncomfortable			0
just 40 per cent of registered voters say they approve of the @entity129 's approach to the @entity131 republic , whose expanding nuclear program is the subject of a deal brokered in november by the @entity28 and five other nations			2
a larger 48 per cent group disapprove			0
@entity28 are less disapproving of the agreement itself , by a 44 – 46 margin , and a 45 – 37 plurality say it will make @entity28 ' less safe			0
' making nice with the mullahs ? secretary of state @entity143 got a grilling in a @entity146 hearing on tuesday , defending the @entity0 administration 's decision to pursue a nuclear pact with @entity99 the only good news for the @entity129 is that @entity28 support @entity0 's pitch to raise the minimum wage nation - wide			1
fully 69 per cent support hiking it by at least some amount , with 27 per cent opposed			0
but the pollsters offered their interviewees three separate choices of how much to raise the minimum wage , compared with only one option to leave it alone			0
@entity25 lawmakers cite economic studies that show minimum wage hikes have corresponded with job losses , particularly among low - skilled and minority workers , as companies let people go in order to comply with wage hikes without spending more money on human resources .			0

@entity0 's support among young voters has disappeared , with 49 per cent now saying they disapprove of his job *performance*
@entity15 ' historic *preference* for the president shows signs of evaporating , with 43 per cent opposing him
52 per cent of the voting public now says @entity0 is not ' honest and trustworthy ' and 51 per cent say he lacks ' strong leadership qualities '
@entity28 who want republicans to control both houses of @entity49 now *outnumber* those who fear one - party control
