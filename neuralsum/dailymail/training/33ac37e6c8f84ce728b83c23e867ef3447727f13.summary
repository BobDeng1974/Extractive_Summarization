placing your wrist under a tap of running water is an age - old trick to cool yourself down when starting to overheat			2
but not everyone has a tap or cold flannel to hand			0
with this in mind , a team of students has developed a bracelet that acts like a wearable air conditioning unit for your wrist			1
called @entity17 , the band directs either cool or warm air to the surface of a wearer 's skin to balance the body 's temperature			1
the bracelet provides heating or cooling to the wearer ’s skin by pointing waves or air at the skin ’s thermoreceptors			1
it glows blue when cooling the skin , and orange while warming it @entity17 was developed by @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity47 - @entity46 from @entity48 , who recently set up embr labs			1
however , unlike a true air conditioner , the device only adjusts the temperature of the wrist , and not the humidity			0
last year , the team 's concept won the $ 10,000 ( £ 6,100 ) first prize in the making and @entity59 at the @entity61 - based university , and it is now a finalist in @entity31 ’s make it wearable competition			1
wrapping a cold flannel around a wrist is a quick way to cool the body down , because there are pulse points in the wrist			0
at these points , blood vessels are closer to the surface of the skin than in other body parts			0
the body 's natural cooling system circulates blood to move heat from inside of the body to the surface of the skin			0
sweat then helps cool the skin by releasing some of this heat as it evaporates			2
the blood near the surface of the skin recirculates through the body and absorbs more heat to be released			0
by placing cold air or bands around these pulse points , it helps the body perform this process more efficiently			0
as a result , the team has been awarded an additional $ 50,000 ( £ 30,700 ) to help make the band a reality			1
in addition to the prize money , all finalists are given mentorship and technical support from the @entity103 - based tech giant			2
a prototype version has been developed , and is undergoing tests			2
designer @entity106 has also created a concept illustration of what the final model will look like			0
as the company explained : ‘ @entity17 uses all - natural waves of coolness or heat to activate the thermoreceptors on the surface of your skin , leaving you feeling rejuvenated			2
‘ it gently glows blue when cooling you , and glows a warm orange while heating you up			0
‘ our comfort depends on a lot more than just core temperature , and we have drawn on the last 30 years of thermal comfort research to design a device for maximised comfort that is also discreet and energy - efficient			0
the winner of @entity31 ’s competition will be announced on 3 november			1
embr labs said the team is working to develop the @entity133 bracelet ‘ as fast as possible ’ , but did not reveal when it would be available or how much it is likely to cost			1
the team has created a prototype ( illustrated ) and recently received $ 50,000 ( £ 30,700 ) in funding			1
winners of the @entity31 competition will be unveiled on 3 november			1
embr labs said the team is working to develop the @entity133 bracelet ‘ as fast as possible ’ , but did not reveal when it would be available or how much it is likely to cost cooling a wrist can cool or heat the rest of a person ’s body because it is a pulse point - meaning the temperature change reaches the blood sooner			1
' at embr labs , we are driven by a shared belief in the importance of connecting mind , body and environment , ’ continued the firm			2
‘ using our patent - pending technology , we 're working hard to make a piece of jewellery that actually does something			0
‘ in fact , we think it will change how the world thinks about wearables and comfort			0
