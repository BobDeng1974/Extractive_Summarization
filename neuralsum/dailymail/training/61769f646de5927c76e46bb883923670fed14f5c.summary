finding the cheapest train ticket for your journey in @entity3 is often a demanding task , and can take hours of research if you ’re really determined to calculate the best deal			1
but a new tool called @entity9 aims to help passengers by working out if it is cheaper to buy multiple tickets for different parts of the same journey - without necessarily having to change train			1
' ticket splitting ' is legal - and all you have to do is take the same journey with two cheaper tickets instead of one more expensive one , without having to break the journey at the middle station			1
now , a desktop version has been launched which also works for advance tickets			2
the tool currently works for single tickets using just one split , and allows users five searches a day			1
@entity34 tells users to watch out if they need to change trains , and says splits are not always identical for the same service			2
the train must call at all stations you buy tickets to or from			2
for example , a @entity54 - @entity53 anytime return is £ 301			1
but researchers found if you buy singles from @entity60 and @entity60 - @entity53 in both directions , it could be £ 82 - a huge saving of £ 219			1
choices : you can book split tickets online or just ask for them at station kiosks - rather than using machines days gone by : passengers ' tickets are checked at @entity70 before they board trains for @entity72 in 1948 the practice is completely within the train operating companies ' terms and conditions , but is not advertised by rail firms – the emphasis is on the user to work out how to find the best deal			1
you can book split tickets online or just ask for them at station kiosks - rather than using machines			2
and you can buy tickets for anywhere at any train station			0
@entity87 , founder and editor of @entity34 , told @entity89 : ' train fares and logic go together like marshmallows and tomato soup			0
yet there ’s a way to work the system and it ’s totally legal			0
' our ticketysplit web tool takes on the ridiculous train ticket pricing anomaly that means buying two separate tickets sometimes costs less			1
and it can save some regular travellers thousands of pounds			0
' we first tested the water with an app that does walk - on fares , then the really tough nut to crack , as there are so many variables , was to do it for advance tickets			0
' the tool proves that when you ask for the " cheapest day return " rail companies are simply not giving it you , their information can not be trusted and people have to fend for themselves			2
' so ensure you do it yourself , just tell the tool when and where you 're travelling and it crunches thousands of advance and walk - on ticket combos to check if you can split and save			1
if so , you can buy them with just a few clicks			0
' @entity126 , @entity127 head of policy , told @entity89 : ' our most recent passenger survey showed that just 45 per cent of them felt they had got value for money on their ticket			0
' some passengers tell us that they can sometimes find better deals by " splitting " tickets , so they will welcome the extra choice the different split - ticket finders provide			1
' the consumer group added that the @entity143 website also offers a split - ticket fare finder tool			2
how it works : step - by - step guide to how money is saved on train tickets looking at purchasing a ticket seven days in advance for @entity152 - @entity151 , an anytime return bought on the day is £ 234			1
the first direct @entity152 - @entity151 service is the 07:12 - 10:47 , for which an advance single costs £ 111.90			2
however , if you split this ticket at @entity159 , you can save £ 33.90			0
this is done by buying advance singles from @entity152 - @entity159 ( £ 68.70 ) and @entity151 ( £ 9.30 ) , totalling £ 78			0
that is £ 33.90 less than the £ 111.90 - and you can stay on the train			0
how to save £ 33.90 without getting off the train : this graphic shows how splitting an advance single from @entity152 to @entity151 - which was originally £ 111.90 - at @entity159 gives a new , lower price of £ 78 on the way back , the last direct @entity151 - @entity152 service is the 18:25 , arriving at 22:03 , for which an advance ticket costs £ 53			1
but by splitting this ticket at @entity159 again , you save £ 8.40			0
to do this you need to by buying advance singles from @entity151 - @entity159 ( £ 9.30 ) and @entity177 ( £ 35.30 ) , totalling £ 44.60			0
this is £ 8.40 less than the £ 53			0
so , overall , you will now buy four advance tickets - from @entity152 - @entity159 ( £ 68.70 ) , @entity180 ( £ 9.30 ) , @entity151 - @entity159 ( £ 9.30 ) and @entity177 ( £ 35.30 ) - totalling £ 122.60			1
that is a saving of £ 42.30 on the original price of @entity152 - @entity151 and @entity151 - @entity152 advance singles - and a whopping £ 111.40 less than the original anytime return price			1
