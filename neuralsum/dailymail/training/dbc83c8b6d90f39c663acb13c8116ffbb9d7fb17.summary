just in time for spring , scientists hope to launch a ' @entity1 for birds ' that will help people identify the tweets that are waking them up in the morning			1
the app , dubbed @entity6 , claims to be able to recognise the song of 88 bird species , and could help track their migration patterns			1
like @entity1 , it works by recording nearby noises on smartphones to analyse it in real - time and identify the bird species according to its tweets			1
the app , dubbed @entity6 , claims to be able to recognise the song of 88 bird species , and could help track their migration patterns whenever the app identifies a bird , geo - tracking allows it to map which species is being spotted where and when , with the information made public			1
the information will be made publicly available to allow zoologists and ecologists monitor species growth and decline , as well as patterns of migration			1
the app , developed by two scientists using a grant from @entity42 , is currently raising funding for development on @entity45			0
at the time of writing , the campaign has raised £ 3,290 ( $ 5,300 ) towards its £ 50,000 ( $ 80,570 ) goal			2
whenever the app identifies a bird , geo - tracking allows it to map which species are being spotted where and when , with the information made public			1
pictured on the left is a bluethroat and on the right a bee eater after recording the bird song , the app returns a list of the most likely results , with percentage indicating their levels of likelihood			1
however , initial test with the @entity69 found that the app still needs to iron out some problems			0
for instance , @entity72 struggled to distinguish between a canada goose and screaming child			0
it 's not uncommon to see a pretty bird flit by when you are enjoying a walk or a picnic - even if you live in a built - up area			0
but if your knowledge of flying fauna is n't up to @entity86 's standards , it can be difficult to work out which creature you have spotted			0
but now an app , developed by computer scientists , can identify a bird from a single photo			2
a team of researchers led by professor @entity94 at @entity95 , @entity96 , have used computer vision and machine learning techniques to create @entity99			0
the free @entity101 app claims to be an electronic field guide featuring 500 of the most common @entity104 bird species			1
it lets users identify bird species by uploading photos and there is also a website , which includes 50,000 images as well as bird calls for each species			2
beginners and experts can sort through species alphabetically , by their relationship in the @entity118 and by the frequency with which they are sighted at a particular place and season			0
in the first test , the app recorded a canada goose , but interference from a ' screaming child ' caused the app to misidentify the calls as those of a crow			0
the @entity45 funding , according to the team , is to help address the app 's problems which will be sold in the spring for £ 1.99 ( $ 3.20 )			1
creator , @entity136 says her goal is ' to bring people closer to the natural world through technology ' and help protect the wildlife for the future			0

@entity6 is capable of recognising the song of 88 bird species
like @entity1 , it works by recording nearby noises on smartphones
@entity6 will map which species are spotted where and when
this will allow public to track migration patterns and monitor species
the app will be released in spring and will cost £ 1.99 ( $ 3.20 )
