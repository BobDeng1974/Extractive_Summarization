in the journal , @entity3 wrote that @entity77 could win due to his energy and focus , but ' he could lose because he lacks humanity and does n't love people '			1
ends up that @entity3 was right at the time since @entity77 's 2002 bid for governor failed but he went on to win in 2010			1

@entity3 was jailed alongside @entity13 and the wife of @entity11			1

' i feel dirty around him , and i feel like i ’m being used			0
i feel like with @entity11 , it ’s all about @entity11 , ' he added			2

as a result , he included some withering reviews of the @entity146 response			0
