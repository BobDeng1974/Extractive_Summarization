the £ 86 @entity2 device – which is sold online and in boots – claims to help women spot the first signs of tumours			1
more than 20,000 of the torches have been sold worldwide since they were launched in 2006			1
but in a ruling published today , the @entity15 said the website which advertises and sells the devices is ‘ misleading ’ and ‘ irresponsible ’			1
cancer charities are also concerned that women are using the torches as a ‘ substitute ’ for breast screening and subsequently getting ‘ false reassurance ’			2
on the product ’s website , manufacturers @entity25 describe the torch as an ‘ earlier breast cancer screening device ’			2
women are advised to use the device in a darkened room and shine the red light of the torch on their breasts which enables them to see under the skin			1
veins and blood vessels appear as dark lines and any tumours may show up as shadows			2
the manufacturers claim to have carried out trials on 300 women showing the torch successfully detected cancers in two thirds of cases			2
they also say that 80 per cent who have used it felt ‘ more confident ’ afterwards			0
but the @entity15 has today ordered the manufacturers to change the website and remove such claims			1
in a statement , the watchdog ruled : ‘ the ad must not appear in its current form			1
we told @entity25 to hold robust evidence before making claims for early detection			0

dr @entity80 , of @entity81 , said : ‘ there is no clear evidence to show this sort of home testing kit could reliably detect breast cancer , so we welcome the decision to ban this advertisement			0
‘ there ’s a danger that using the device could leave some women with increased levels of anxiety and others with false reassurance			2
’ @entity98 , of @entity99 , said : ‘ we would like to reassure women that there is no need to spend money on products like these			0
‘ the best way for women to be breast aware is to know their own breasts , to touch and look for changes and to check anything unusual with their gp			0
’ and a spokesman for @entity114 said : ‘ @entity115 is not a substitute for the breast screening programme or general breast awareness			0
‘ the most effective tool for detecting breast cancer is mammography			0
