it 's a highly - anticipated deal that keeps his nation from teetering over the edge of the fiscal cliff - yet president @entity5 has not even shown up to sign the new bill into law			1
instead , @entity5 , who is vacationing in @entity8 , has signed the bill using an autopen , a mechanical device that copies his signature - allowing him to accept the deal after playing a round of golf			1
while he 's the only president in history to turn to the gadget to sign a bill into law , it is not the first time president @entity5 has used it			1
in may 2011 , he used the pen to sign the @entity25 - extending anti-terrorism measures enacted in the wake of 9/11 - while he was 3,725 miles and six time zones away in @entity28 at a @entity30 meeting			1
the fiscal cliff bill was approved on a sunny day in @entity62 during which the president played a round of golf at a @entity68 base in nearby @entity69			1
in between the round of golf , working out at the local gum and dining with his wife and friends , @entity5 reviewed a copy of the legislation and ordered that the original be signed by autopen in @entity79 @entity80 : @entity5 winks at photographers as he arrives in the briefing room to make remarks after the @entity36 passed legislation intended to avoid the fiscal cliff after months of wrangling , the deal was finally reached after @entity5 cut his family vacation short last week , returning to @entity79 on december 26 for the negotiations			1
but after addressing the nation following the @entity36 's passage of the fiscal cliff deal , @entity5 jetted back to the @entity33 late on tuesday night			1
he arrived in @entity62 before 5am local time yesterday and immediately rejoined the @entity94 in their rented beachside vacation home in @entity96 , a picturesque suburb on the east side of @entity98			0
after @entity5 used the autopen to sign the @entity25 in 2011 , critics claimed using the mechanical device to write his signature was unconstitutional			1
@entity103 1 , section 7 of the constitution states that if a bill is passed by both the @entity36 and @entity107 , it shall be presented to the president			2
' if he approve ( s ) he shall sign it , ' states the @entity110			0
president @entity5 's @entity112 signature ...			2
and the autopen signature conservative critics have claimed that using the autopen for a president to write his signature is unconstitutional			2
@entity103 1 , section 7 of the constitution states that if a bill is passed by both the @entity36 and @entity107 , it shall be presented to the president			2
' if he approve ( s ) he shall sign it , ' states the @entity110			0
there is nothing in the document that suggests a reasonable facsimile affixed by an appliance will do just as well			0
but in 2005 , the @entity131 's @entity130 deemed the use of the autopen constitution , ruling that ' the president need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill to sign it '			2
the autopen is often used by politicians and celebrities to duplicate signatures for letters			0
@entity5 is the first president to use the device to sign a bill into law , but @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 are also known to have used the autopen			1
there is nothing in the document that suggests a reasonable facsimile affixed by an appliance will do just as well			0
but the @entity36 sidestepped the constitutional requirement by citing a 2005 opinion from the @entity131 's @entity130			0
it concluded that ' the president need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law '			2
in the @entity36 's view , it does not make a difference that one bill is really signed by the president and the other bears a look - alike signature , and it rejected calls for him to re-sign the @entity25			1
the autopen has been called into question in other cases ; in 2004 , then - secretary of defense @entity172 met criticism for using an autopen to sign condolence letters to the families of fallen troops			0
and in 1992 then - vice president @entity178 was lambasted for using the autopen on official correspondence during an appearance on ' @entity182 with @entity183 '			0
@entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 are also known to have used the autopen , yet @entity5 is the first president to have used it to sign a bill into law			1
