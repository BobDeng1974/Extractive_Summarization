an entire family of small frogs found on the coast of @entity3 is thought to have been wiped out by a deadly amphibian disease			1
the @entity6 's frog , and its cousin the chile darwin 's frog , have not been spotted for months and scientists from @entity10 and @entity11 believe they are now extinct			1
the disease is called chytridiomycosis and the claims have been made by the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) and @entity17 ( @entity18 )			1

the @entity6 's frog and its cousin the chile darwin 's frog , pictured , have not been spotted for months and scientists believe they are now extinct @entity6 's frog and its cousin the chile darwin 's frog are both named after naturalist and evolutionist @entity6			1
as its name suggests , the @entity10 @entity6 's frog is endemic to @entity10 , while its cousin was also found in @entity30			1
@entity6 first discovered the @entity32 species in 1834 in south @entity10 during his voyage around the globe			0
the species have a distinct appearance , having evolved to look like a leaf , with a pointy nose			0
@entity6 's frogs are small , reaching a size of only 3cm in length			2
professor @entity42 from @entity16 's @entity43 said : ‘ only a few examples of the ' extinction by infection ' phenomenon exist			0
‘ although not entirely conclusive , the possibility of chytridiomycosis being associated with the extinction of the northern @entity6 's frog gains further support with this study			1
’ the scientists claim the plummeting numbers and the disappearance of the creatures from most of their territory across @entity10 and @entity30 can not be explained by habitat loss alone			0
hundreds of specimens of @entity6 's frogs and other amphibians from similar habitats were collected between 1835 and 1989			2
each were tested in order to find dna pieces of @entity66 ( @entity67 ) , a fungus that causes the disease chytridiomycosis			0

the disease is called chytridiomycosis and comes from a fungus called @entity66 ( @entity67 ) in addition , 26 populations of @entity6 's frogs were surveyed in @entity10 and @entity30 between 2008 and 2012 for the presence of @entity67 research leader dr. @entity83 , from @entity18 and former @entity16 phd student said : ‘ amphibians have inhabited the earth for 365 million years , far longer than mammals			1
‘ we may have already lost one species , the northern @entity6 's frog , but we can not risk losing the other one			2
there is still time to protect this incredible species			0
‘ amphibians provide an important ecosystem service by maintaining balance in the environment			0
without them insect plagues and their subsequent effect on agriculture and public health would be more frequent			0
‘ @entity16 scientists are working to further understand the reasons behind the extinction of @entity6 's frogs , and ensure the long - term survival of the species			0

@entity6 ’s frog and the chile darwin ’s frog are both said to now be extinct
it 's thought a disease called chytridiomycosis has wiped them out
one of the last known *sightings* of the small frog was in *january* 2013
