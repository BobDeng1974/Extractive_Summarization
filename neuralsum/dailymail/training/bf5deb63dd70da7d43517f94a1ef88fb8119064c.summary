by @entity0 published : 23:03 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 3 january 2013 a gunman thought to have murdered three women in a rampage through an @entity5 is to be questioned about a similar massacre on a @entity8 family last year , it emerged today			1
police in @entity10 are waiting to interview the 33 - year - old psychiatric patient , named locally by his first name @entity13 , thought to be responsible for last night 's carnage in @entity15 , in the @entity17 canton , 60 miles east of @entity18			1
the man , who has a history of threatening people with guns , is in a ' stable condition ' in intensive care after being shot in the chest by a tactical police firearms unit last night			1
had they not stopped him he would have killed more people			1
' at around 8.30pm , the alleged killer , who is believed to have been thrown out of the @entity60 for making threats with guns , stormed out of the @entity63 ( @entity65 ) restaurant in @entity15 following a heavy drinking session , and picked up two rifles from his nearby flat			2
he is then said to have used the weapons - a hunting gun and an antique military carbine used by the @entity71 in the world wars - to kill and maim those around him			2
witnesses said he fired indiscriminately , first from his flat before turning his guns on a nearby lane and a multi-storey car park			1
his principal targets were apparently three women aged 32 , 54 and 79 - all of whom he knew - while two men aged 33 and 63 were badly wounded			2
one , a retired police chief , is thought to be the suspected killer 's uncle			1
the survivors were tonight ' critical but stable ' after being airlifted to hospital in nearby @entity88 , the capital of @entity17			0
picking up the pieces : forensics officers in the village , where the unnamed 33 - year - old fired up to 20 shots at neighbours and the police tragedy : the gunman is a local resident known as a drug addict and former mental patient the youngest victims of the 45 - minute rampage , the 32 - year - old woman and 33 - year - old man , were a married couple with young children			1
the attack had disturbing similarities to the one in which four people including a @entity8 couple were shot dead by a mystery gunman in september , less than 100 miles away			1
@entity8 engineer @entity112 , 50 , his wife @entity115 , 47 , and mother - in - law @entity116 , 74 , were killed alongside 45 - year - old @entity32 cyclist @entity117 in an @entity5 beauty spot close to the @entity32 village of @entity120 , by @entity121			1
police are largely baffled about what happened in the @entity32 attack , although they fear that the assailant might have been a crazed psychiatric patient with a history of threatening people with guns			1
terrifying : part of the pretty village is cordoned off after the killer was arrested and placed in custody gun collection : @entity10 general prosecutor @entity54 said ' at least two weapons were used ' including a hunting rifle and an antique military carbine dating back to before @entity137 the @entity120 attacker is also thought to have used an antique weapon , possibly an ex-military @entity143 handgun , parts of which were found at the scene			1
as in @entity120 , those who died in @entity15 received clinical shots to the head and chest , while those wounded received shots to the shoulder and pelvis			2
@entity153 , the seven - year - old who survived the @entity120 shootings along with her four - year - old sister @entity156 , suffered a shoulder wound			0
@entity32 prosecutor @entity158 said at the end of last year that a deranged gun enthusiast was high on his list of possible suspects , explaining : ' we are looking for unbalanced people - capable of extreme violence			2
people who have access to weapons - hunters , collectors , shooting club members - some of whom could have had psychiatric problems			1
' senseless violence : a crowd forms at the scene where the brutal attack took place			2
an elderly couple thought to be related to the gunman are among the dead saddened : @entity180 , left , chief prosecutor of @entity181 , speaks beside @entity182 , chief of police ad interim , at a news conference in @entity15 today both @entity32 and @entity10 police today confirmed that the @entity15 killer would be questioned about the @entity120 atrocity , with a spokesman for the @entity191 force adding : ' our inquiry will investigate every element of the attack , including possible links with nearby crimes			1
' despite having psychiatric and drug problems and no weapons licence , the @entity10 attacker spent a number of days in protective custody in 2005 for threatening people with guns , which were later confiscated			1
he is said to have fired at least 20 shots in @entity15 , a picturesque village surrounded by vineyards , some at the police who had come to arrest him			1
local resident @entity210 said the unemployed man ' had drunk a lot ' before the attack			1
he lived on his own but under the surveillance of the local authorities , and received a disability allowance			0
she said : ' we heard shots outside , dimmed the lights and hit the floor			0
' the killer , named locally as @entity13 , is said to have been kicked out of the @entity60 for threatening people with guns , it has emerged			1
he is said to be the son of divorced parents and left home when he was 18			2
he spent a short spell in the military but was considered a danger and placed under psychiatric care in 2005			0
@entity13 was described by one local as a ‘ gun lover with an obsession with the army ’			0
he has no car so you often see him wandering around on foot , ’ added the source			0
‘ he left home at 18 after his parents split up and has struggled ever since			2
‘ his dream in the army was to become an instructor , but he was soon thrown out			0
he became a waster - spending all his time smoking cannabis and playing video games			0
’ the source said @entity13 had been in dispute with his ex-police chief uncle , who was one of his victims			1
a former classmate of @entity13 described him as a mixture of ‘ @entity257 and boy scout ’ , saying that he once had a big collection of guns and knives which he kept at home			0
a @entity10 police spokesman last night confirmed that the killer was now ‘ stable ’ and - despite his injuries - would ‘ soon be in a position to speak ’			2
@entity268 , who runs the @entity269 in @entity15 , said : ' my sister - in - law heard shooting and went out on the street and was herself shot			0
' weapons possession is extremely high in @entity10 , where soldiers are allowed to take guns home striking similarities : police had been looking for a mentally unstable gunman living in the area in relation to the @entity282 massacre of last year rules : part - time soldiers in @entity10 can keep guns at home , as long as they are not fully automatic and ammo is restricted police arrived in @entity15 after receiving reports of people lying in the streets following a spate of gunfire			1
they wounded the gunman after initially finding it difficult to locate him in the dark , and he was arrested and placed in custody by a special tactical team			1
@entity288 spokesman @entity300 said : ' at the moment there is incomprehension and shock here in @entity17			0
the toll is very , very heavy			0
it 's a sombre start to the year for the canton			0
' it was n't easy to intervene in the darkness			0
the gunman turned his weapon on the officers , who had to shoot him in order not to be injured themselves			2
' arrested : the gunman was wounded after officers struggled to find him in the dark not the first time : the attack took place less than 100 miles from the @entity32 village where five people were shot dead by a mystery gunman last year armed and dangerous : up to three million guns are in circulation in the nation of eight million @entity326 was walking her dogs when she heard gunfire , saying : ' there were people running around near the chapel			1
' at first i did n't realise what was going on			0
i thought children were shooting at cats and i called out for them to stop			2
i am still shocked at the thought that i could have been hit by a bullet			0
' local authority chief @entity338 said : ' the day was sunny here but the night black			0
what a terrible start to 2013			0
' @entity15 has a population of just 400 people			0
the alleged killer moved there a number of years ago from the nearby town of @entity15			0
gun ownership is widespread in @entity10 , with around a quarter of the eight million population carrying weapons			0
army - issue weapons are used in the deaths of more than 300 people in @entity10 every year			2
a judicial investigation has been opened into the latest killings in @entity15 , although none of the victims have yet been named			0
on guard : army - issue weapons are used in the deaths of more than 300 people in @entity10 every year @entity360 : a policeman controls traffic on the road into @entity15 following the shooting @entity365 : most @entity10 towns and villages have a shooting club that meets for target practice at least once a week @entity10 police close off the road to the village in the wake of the shooting , which is believed to have been carried out by a drunk man with an assault rifle lockdown : the village of @entity15 was closed to the press following a shooting statement : police say they will release more information about the horrifying events later today			1

the killer *wielded* three weapons as he fired indiscriminately in the street
reports say ' drunk ' man was wounded in police shootout and arrested
he murdered three people and injured several more before he was stopped
all were reportedly known to the gunman , with one thought to be his uncle
two of the victims were married and the parents of young children
the massacre has striking similarities to @entity410 attack on @entity8 family
