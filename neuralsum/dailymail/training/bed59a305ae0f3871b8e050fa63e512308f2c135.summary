by @entity0 published : 05:19 est , 17 august 2012 updated : 06:42 est , 17 august 2012 while most teenagers are quivering with nerves when it comes to taking their maths a level , @entity1 described it as easy peasy - and he was just seven years - old			1
now the prodigy has gained his third top - grade a level pass at the tender age of ten			1
@entity1 , whose teacher claims he has ' a brain like a calculator , ' achieved an a * in @entity16 and now hopes to go to university			1
he already has an a * in @entity19 and an a in @entity21 - both of which he gained at the age of eight			1
he 's got the @entity26 = y factor : @entity1 , appropriately sitting in front of a picture of @entity29 , has achieved another excellent grade ( seen here aged eight ) he is the youngest person in the world to have achieved a grade a in @entity19 - scoring 100 per cent and 99 per cent in two of the six papers two years ago			1
@entity1 , from @entity35 , says he did not suffer from exam nerves as he tackled his @entity16 exam paper this year			1
he said : ' i opened it , looked at the first question and just started writing			1
' i did n't feel nervous			1
i probably felt better than the other teenagers			1
' his father , @entity42 , a 49 - year - old @entity42 , who raised his son single - handedly after his marriage broke up , said : ' it just confirmed my expectation			1
i felt very pleased and very proud			1
' he does n't work that hard at all			2
he just does the minimum			2
he was born with a talent			2
' @entity1 , who goes to @entity51 in @entity35 , has tutoring sessions at @entity53			2
he is now hoping to find a university that will let him enrol on a @entity19 course			1
he started reading at a very early age and has learnt @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			2
the boy 's headmaster , @entity61 , said two years ago : ' @entity1 is off the scale - just so far ahead of everyone else			2
his thinking skills are incredible			2
' we 've linked him to a professor at a local university to tutor him			2
while most teenagers fret about their exams , @entity1 sailed through his maths paper with ease ( picture posed by models ) ' he 's not just gifted			0
he is way more than that			0
the word genius springs to mind			0
' one of his teachers , @entity80 , said last year : ' it is like having a second teacher in the classroom			0
he has got a brain like a calculator			0
' his impressive mark came on the same day that thousands failed to make the grade			0
more than a quarter of a million university applicants are stuck ‘ in limbo ’ after a drop in a grades triggered an unprecedented scramble for places			0
record numbers of teenagers missed the grades they needed to secure their first - choice degree courses , causing ‘ gridlock ’ in the system as universities sifted through borderline candidates			0
decades of ‘ grade inflation ’ ended as candidates passed 26.6 per cent of exams at grade a – down 0.4 per cent on last year			0
it marked the biggest fall in the proportion gaining as since grades were introduced in 1965 to replace a simple pass or fail			0
the number of exams awarded the elite a * – used for the first time in 2010 to counter a relentless rise in results – also fell , from 8.2 per cent to 7.9 per cent			1
