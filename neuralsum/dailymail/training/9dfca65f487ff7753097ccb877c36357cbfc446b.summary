cyclists across @entity1 are being urged to arm themselves with cameras so that they have evidence against motorists in court after a truckie was convicted of getting too close to one man on a bicycle			1
in the @entity10 , @entity11 , a truck driver was handed a conviction for breaking a new rule , introduced in april , that means drivers must keep a 1.5m gap limit from cyclists at all times			1
@entity20 director @entity19 told @entity21 : ‘ there are lots of people who take umbrage to our presence on the roads and a camera covers the cyclist if anything goes wrong			1
mr @entity41 was filmed overtaking too close to a cyclist who was wearing a camera while cycling along a two - lane road at 7.55am on july 4 this year			1
outside court mr @entity41 told the @entity46 the cyclist had ‘ a camera on his helmet and a big chip on his shoulder ’			2
mr @entity19 , who is campaigning for the new @entity52 to be introduced across @entity1 and not just @entity11 and the @entity53 , said : ‘ more cyclists are buying cameras to help enforce the law			1
’ @entity20 director @entity19 ( left ) has urged cyclists to equip themselves with cameras such as the @entity59 ( right ) which gives them evidence that they can use in court the minimum passing distance for motorists in @entity11 is now a minimum of 1 metre when passing cyclists in a 60km/h or less speed zone and at least 1.5 metres where the speed limit is over 60km/h			1
motorists are allowed to cross centre lines , including double unbroken centre lines , straddle lane - lines or drive on painted islands to pass cyclists provided the driver has a clear view of any approaching traffic and it is safe to do so			2
the minimum passing distance will be trialled in the state for two years and will help make drivers more aware of cyclists			0
on 7 september 2011 , cyclist @entity84 filmed the moment he was hit by a white car during his early morning commute mr @entity84 had a front and back camera on his bike which showed the horrific incident that broke his back ‘ we always hear the argument that sticking to this rule would force drivers to overtake on the other side of the road but if there is n’t room they should wait … there is a brake pedal and we are more than ready to see them to use it , ’ mr @entity19 said			1
recent research by @entity105 showed nearly half of drivers wish they did n't have to share the road with their two - wheeled nemesis			0
‘ we certainly encourage cyclists to use cameras if they are road riders or sporting cyclists , they normally have the most issues on the road traffic			2
' a lawyer told @entity21 that using footage filmed on a cyclist ’s camera is no different than using @entity120 footage in court			2
without footage cyclists are often told it 's just their word against the motorist , mr @entity19 said			1
‘ police in @entity11 have stated they are supportive of cyclists using the cameras if drivers are breaking the @entity52 , ’ mr @entity19 added			1
‘ there is a small majority of drivers who seem intent on doing the wrong thing and then there are those that do n’t pay attention to cyclists , ’ he claimed			0
the @entity53 followed @entity11 ’s lead and also introduced the @entity52 in april			2
the rule will be trialled for 12 months as the government attempts to make cycling safer by keeping cars and bikes apart			0
in @entity144 recently , a cyclist captured the frightening moment he was chucked over the windscreen of a car in @entity148			0
@entity149 said the footage convinced police that he had not broken the law			0
mr @entity149 was cycling home from work when a driver allegedly pulled out in front of him at the intersection of @entity159 and @entity160 streets in @entity161 on @entity148 's lower north shore			0
and on 7 september 2011 , cyclist @entity84 filmed the moment he was hit by a white car during his early morning commute			0
he broke his back in the accident and has been left with chronic back pain			0
some of the most popular cameras used by cyclists are the @entity172 device and the @entity173 , which can cost hundreds of dollars but are deemed worth it .			0

in @entity11 , motorists must keep a 1.5m gap from cyclists
the cyclist filmed the incident with a helmet on his camera
