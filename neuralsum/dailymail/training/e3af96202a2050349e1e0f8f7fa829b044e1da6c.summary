forget the fuss over @entity1 , the impending @entity3 debut of @entity5 transfer record signing @entity6 is what should be getting @entity9 fans excited right now			1
for £ 60million , you ’d expect a player who can run , dribble , cross , pass and score goals for fun			2
thankfully for @entity16 , that ’s just what @entity6 did for @entity18 against @entity19 on wednesday night , having a hand in every goal in a 4 - 2 win			1
@entity23 highlights : @entity19 2 - 4 @entity18 running riot : @entity6 shone for @entity18 in their 4 - 2 win against @entity19 on wednesday @entity6 , 26 , excelled in a free role by @entity18 boss @entity28 due to @entity29 missing out through injury			1
if he can repeat the performance against @entity33 on sunday september 14 , @entity9 ’s early - season woe will be quickly forgotten			2
the heat map showed the @entity36 ’s biggest signing has in his locker			0
he hugged both left and right touchlines at times , drifted inside to make an impact on other occasions , and had the energy to get into the penalty area with some great runs			0
from an inside - right position , he produced a fantastic pass with the outside of his left boot for @entity50 to score the opening goal			0
mr @entity52 : @entity6 's touch map showed he excelled for @entity18 in a free - role on wednesday he crossed for @entity56 ’s @entity55 from the right - hand byline and set up @entity58 with a set - piece			1
he then scored the fourth himself with a delightful dink over advancing goalkeeper @entity61 , timing his run into the area to perfection to receive and dispatch @entity65 ’s pass			2
it must have given food for thought for @entity16 as he works out how to assemble his expensive chess pieces in the right formation			2
he was the outstanding individual from a clash between the two best teams in the world , and it was n’t surprising @entity28 described him afterwards as ‘ one of the best five players in the world ’			0
exquisite : @entity6 ( right ) scored @entity18 's fourth goal against @entity19 with a delightful chip all hugs : @entity6 ( right ) is embraced by @entity82 ( left ) after scoring against the @entity83 delighted : @entity18 boss @entity28 ( right ) hailed @entity6 as one of the best five players in the world ’ all smiles : @entity6 ( right ) poses for a picture with @entity88 ( left ) and @entity89 it ’s clear he could play wide , in the middle or as an orthodox @entity92 for @entity9			1
or a combination of all three			0
just set him free and let him get on the ball ! @entity6 was injured when @entity19 beat @entity18 in the @entity97 final in july – and showed in @entity98 how badly the @entity99 missed him			1
now it ’ll soon be time to turn his attention back to @entity9 , where former @entity103 team - mate @entity102 , one of @entity6 ’s predecessors to wear @entity9 ’s famous @entity106 shirt , has already given his blessing			1
‘ @entity6 is going to be good			0
i told him being @entity106 is a big responsibility but he will be able to live up to it ’			0
the hype that was attached to @entity9 ’s dramatic deadline day capture of @entity1 on loan somewhat overshadowed the fact that their most important piece of business was signing @entity6 from @entity103			1
@entity120 taste : @entity9 's new no 7 @entity6 joined in a £ 60million move from @entity103 overshadowed : @entity9 also signed world class striker @entity1 on loan on transfer deadline day @entity125 wo n’t be able to squeeze in all his big names and @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity1 and particularly @entity129 will be sweating , not to mention @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 lower down the pecking order			1
yet @entity6 wo n’t have to worry			0
he will be in any strongest @entity9 xi. the only question is where ? @entity125 primarily sees him as a winger , complaining that the wide players already at the club were n’t world - class			2
but @entity6 showed , especially with the opening assist for @entity50 , that if he does drift inside , he has the vision to create chances from virtually nothing			0
food for thought : @entity6 's ability means @entity9 boss @entity16 could use him in several formations on the ball : @entity6 ( centre ) made his @entity9 debut in their 0 - 0 draw at @entity153 on saturday if @entity16 chooses a 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 , @entity6 is capable of playing at @entity92 , supplying the ammunition for two out of @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity1			1
that would guarantee he sees as much of the ball as possible			0
or he could be part of a midfield three with @entity158 and @entity159 or @entity160 , though that would take away some of his attacking dimension			0
in a 3 - 5 - 2 , he could bomb on from midfield , and @entity16 might even think he ’s got the work - rate to be one of the wing - backs			1
@entity168 talent : @entity6 could be utilised as a wing - back , winger or central midfielder by @entity16 in a 4 - 3 - 3 , he could play either right or left to feed @entity1 or @entity128			1
@entity125 ’s philosophy is all about footballing intelligence and the ability to change positions , not only between matches but during matches too			0
in that respect , @entity6 is his identikit signing			2
if he can prove it against world champions @entity19 , imagine how he might tear up the @entity182 .			0
