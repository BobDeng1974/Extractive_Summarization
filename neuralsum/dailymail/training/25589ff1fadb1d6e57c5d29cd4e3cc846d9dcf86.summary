by @entity0 a knock at the door in the middle of the night			1
a policeman telling you your teenage daughter has been abducted			2
they ’re trying to find her but she may have already been sold as a sex slave or a child bride			0
a chance she might be dead			0
and 270 of her friends have been taken too			0
reality in parts of @entity15			1
in @entity17 and the @entity18 we still have the capacity to be stunned when evil descends on our classrooms			0
who could forget ? sixteen boys and girls and a teacher murdered at @entity26 , 12 students and one teacher wiped out at @entity29 , 20 children and six staff shot dead at @entity32			2
all of them events of such horrific magnitude they will forever be etched in the world ’s collective memory			0
@entity39 leader @entity38 said he will ' sell ' the schoolgirls his terror group kidnapped three weeks ago these massacres shocked us to our core precisely because they were so out of the ordinary – innocent children gunned down in the supposed safety of their schools			1
but in @entity15 , where i have been this past week , the bombing , burning and kidnapping of schoolchildren is now almost a regular occurrence			1
another day , another outrage			0
schools are far from safe havens , and they must be just that			0
they have almost become instruments of war , and the brutality inside those walls has become so commonplace it is rarely reported			0
why in @entity66 ’s name has it taken three weeks for the world to sit up and care about this atrocity ? i once visited a school on the outskirts of @entity15 ’s capital , @entity72 , with @entity73			1
when we asked the children what their ambitions were , we found they were the same as kids all around the world			0
former @entity17 prime minister @entity0 said the international community had to work together to prevent the spread of groups like @entity39 some wanted to be teachers , doctors and nurses , others engineers , airline pilots and scientists			1
none , of course , had ambitions of being a politician – and to @entity73 ’s surprise , none wanted to be a rock star			0
what struck me most during our visit were the appalling conditions and the substandard education they were receiving			2
lessons were being offered in a dilapidated school with a leaking , corrugated iron roof			2
children huddled together , three or four at a rickety desk built for one			0
what we ultimately learned was deeply disturbing			0
we found this school was losing pupils to a madrasa only a few miles away – a new , fresh , well - financed institution that offered free education			1
but the drawback was that they were indoctrinating students by preaching support for terrorism			0
@entity0 had previously traveled to @entity15 with @entity122 rock singer @entity73 where he discovered that extremist schools were offering free education to poor children so it is no surprise to me that extremism , fed by propaganda infiltrated through the education system , is on the rise in @entity15			1
and now , thankfully , the international community has finally woken up to the fact that 270 girls were snatched at gunpoint from their school			1
the murderous terrorist group @entity39 – the name means ‘ @entity141 education is forbidden ’ – has claimed responsibility for the abductions , and their twisted leader @entity38 released a video stating the girls should not have been in school and should be married			1
a further eight girls were kidnapped last week			1
these lives now hang in the balance			0
kidnapped and carted off in lorries into the jungle territory of @entity155 , their parents are unsure whether they will be used as sex slaves , taken over the border and sold as child brides , or killed			0
it is horrendously late but a search , involving the @entity17 and @entity18 and using state - of - the - art equipment , will finally begin			0
three weeks ago and within hours of the mass abduction , i asked for international support to rescue them			0
thanks to @entity168 , our foreign secretary , and @entity171 , the @entity18 secretary of state , specialist teams are in place			0
last week the world was angry and vocal			2
look to the # @entity176 campaign			0
this week the world will be watching and @entity178 the @entity15 government and their people deserve the fullest support in tackling terrorism			1
last week in @entity72 , @entity39 bombed and killed dozens			1
over the past four years the group ’s attacks on @entity15 have taken more than 4,000 lives			1
we also now know that in a separate incident in the past few weeks , seven teachers were murdered and 27 members of their families were abducted in @entity155			2
another day , another outrage			0
this brings to 171 the number of teachers who have been assassinated in @entity15 since 2009			1
it makes it all the more important that a @entity197 i announced in @entity72 on wednesday – to increase the security available to pupils and teachers in their school grounds – is moved forward as quickly as possible			2
we simply can not stand by and see schools shut down , girls cut off from their education and parents in fear of their daughters ’ lives			1
the education system that has the potential to transform @entity15 can not be undermined			1
starting with a 500 - school pilot programme in northern states , the @entity197 will focus on school and community interventions , with special measures for the most at - risk children			1
the initiative will build community groups to promote safe zones for education , comprising teachers , parents , police , community leaders and young people			2
ex-corrie star @entity227 also gave her support to the international campaign to release the girls this initiative , which came from the @entity232 led by my wife @entity233 , is part of our work to give every girl and boy in @entity15 the opportunity to learn and fulfil their ambitions			1
surely in the year 2014 , every boy and girl should be at school and no one should be prevented from an education			1
sadly there are still 57 million across the world who are denied even basic schooling			0
there are children in @entity15 prepared to stand up to terrorism			1
last week 12 young @entity15 , appointed global ambassadors by education initiative @entity256 , made a statement showing that they will not be cowed by terrorist threats			1
they declared they will continue their work for the right of every child to go to school safely			2
and @entity15 is not the only country at risk			1
more than two million out - of - school children are growing up in conflict zones , whether it be the @entity269 - @entity268 border , on the fringes of @entity271 , or in @entity272 , and all of them are vulnerable to extremist influences as we cut global education aid year after year			1
all the world ’s aid put together offers @entity279 only $ 13 per pupil per year – barely enough to buy one school book per child			2
faced with a rising school - age population , @entity15 receives just $ 2 per pupil , but it needs to spend $ 2 billion a year more if it is to meet the @entity285 that every child be at school by 2015			1
i also now believe that discrimination against girls has become the civil rights struggle of our times			2
thankfully , millions of girls across the world are now prepared to stand up for their rights			2
a few weeks ago i returned to @entity268 18 months after a visit i made following the shooting of @entity299			0
then , there was rage that a young girl could be shot simply for wanting girls to go to school			1
a whole population almost seemed fearful and cowed by the @entity306			0
however , on my recent trip , addressing 2,000 girls who had turned out in @entity308 , i found a determination that no girl should ever be forced out of their country by the @entity306 again			2
none of them wanted their country to be defined to the world any more by a shooting			0
they wanted @entity268 recognised not by their failure to get girls to school but by their success			1
these socially aware girls , desperate for education and careers , are globalisation ’s children – born in the latest wave of change , aware , through their mobile phone contact with the outside world , of the opportunities girls enjoy elsewhere			1
their outrage at the denial of opportunity could threaten over the coming decade to bring unresponsive governments to their knees			0
a generation ago , young people might have accepted that their rights were what others bestowed on them , their opportunities simply what parents and grandparents handed down , and that a shortage of ability , not a shortage of opportunity , explained their fate			0
now not so , and probably never again			0
they are fighting back but there will be moments of despair on their journey			0
in @entity359 this past week , it has been heartbreaking to see the desolation on faces as they wait for news about the girls			1
we should be taking even more action			0
schools that already have the same legal rights under international law as hospitals should also be the subject of agreements that they never become instruments of war			0
they should be as safe as the hospitals that have @entity378 on them and the @entity285 buildings and vehicles that bear the blue @entity285 symbol			1
perpetrators of terrorist crimes against children should be aware that murdering or abducting them is a heinous crime that the authorities will punish			0
even in the world ’s most dangerous places , we must now establish the right of all children to schooling and make a new idea of ‘ education without borders ’ a reality			2
and while we can not end terrorism overnight , we can show determination to stand up to it by making schools safe and defending every child ’s right to education … and to life .			2

@entity0 has spent the past week in @entity15 as @entity285 special envoy for @entity406
@entity0 : ' the bombing , burning and kidnapping of schoolchildren is almost a regular occurrence '
@entity39 means ' *western* education is forbidden '
@entity416 chief @entity38 said the girls should not have been in school and should be married instead
