@entity1 spies plotted to assassinate @entity2 on a @entity4 street in the late 90s			1
the plan was to send him death threats claiming to be from a far - right organisation before shooting him @entity1 spies were so fed up with @entity10 harbouring terrorists that they hatched a plot to assassinate @entity2 on a @entity4 street , it was claimed last night			1
security officials were intending to kill the hook - handed cleric with a rifle while posing as members of the extremist group @entity19			1
the far - right organisation would then have been left to take the blame for his death			0
the @entity1 intelligence service , @entity23 ( @entity23 ) , also hatched a separate plot to kidnap @entity2 from outside his west @entity4 home and bundle him on a ferry to @entity1			1
they were concerned @entity29 terrorists were planning an attack on the @entity31 and wanted to remove the hate preacher from circulation			1
his ranting sermons outside the @entity37 mosque in north @entity4 were considered an inspiration to @entity29 fanatics			2
the capital became known as ‘ @entity41 ’ – with @entity1 officials concerned the @entity10 police and security services were not doing enough to combat @entity46 extremism			2
the claims are made by the @entity48 not hate anti-extremist think - tank and campaign group in a report on banned terror group @entity52 , which had strong ties to @entity2			2
the report ’s author , @entity54 , writes : ‘ one plot hatched by @entity1 intelligence that has , until now , not previously come to light , was the idea of assassinating @entity2 in @entity4			2
‘ the plan was to impersonate the @entity10 @entity62 group @entity19 and then allow them to take the blame			1
‘ in the immediate aftermath of the @entity4 nail - bombings , the @entity1 considered sending death threats in the style of @entity19 and then killing him with the same type of weaponry that the group was thought to possess			1
' however , as with the kidnap plan , the assassination attempt was aborted and it is unclear how advanced the planning of either idea progressed			0
’ the @entity1 intelligence service also hatched a separate plot to kidnap @entity2 from outside his west @entity4 home and bundle him on a ferry to @entity1			1
on the kidnapping plot , in the build - up to the @entity31 , mr @entity54 , a respected and long - standing campaigner , writes : ‘ angered by the inaction of @entity85 and @entity86 in the @entity10 , there was serious talk of [ the @entity1 ] taking matters into their own hands			2
' he would be nabbed on the street , forced into the back of a van and then driven to @entity93 and snuck on to a @entity1 ferry			1
‘ it is also known that a team of assassins from @entity98 , a @entity23 unit , was considering taking out senior terrorists			0
’ the report said @entity52 , co-founded by hate preacher @entity102 – can be linked to jihad and terror attacks at home and abroad			0
seventy people convicted of terrorism or terrorist - related offences in the @entity10 , or who have died abroad over the past 14 years , have been linked to the organisation			0
the group has allegedly sent hundreds of @entity10 citizens to war zones across the globe , including 50 to 80 people fighting in @entity116			0
several hundred @entity52 volunteers have travelled to train or fight in @entity118 or @entity119			0
the group is also said to have encouraged supporters to go to @entity121 and @entity122 – with several rising to leading positions in @entity121 terror group @entity124			0
mr @entity54 says he has identified links between the infamous ‘ @entity126 ’ – @entity126 – and @entity102			0
neither @entity1 ’s @entity127 , nor the @entity23 intelligence service , would comment on the alleged plan to kill @entity2 , who is in a @entity131 jail awaiting trial on charges of running a terrorist training camp			1
he was extradited last year after a lengthy £ 1million legal battle .			0
