by @entity0 published : 19:01 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 03:40 est , 28 november 2012 findings from @entity3 research suggest that doing more walking and gardening could help individuals with high cholesterol as much , if not more , than drugs unfit people with high cholesterol levels would be better off gardening or going for a walk than taking pills , says a study			1
being physically fit cuts the risk of dying by two thirds compared with couch potatoes who take statins			1
researchers found that doing more exercise could help people with high cholesterol as much , or more , than drugs			0
however , it also found that combining statins with keeping fit could improve survival rates even further			1
many experts claim statins should be offered to all over- 50s because everyone could benefit from lower cholesterol , but the ten - year study of 10,000 @entity3 veterans found that the very fit were 60 - 70 per cent less likely to die than unfit people on statins			1
professor @entity33 , who led the research at the @entity35 in @entity36 , said : ‘ the fitness necessary to attain protection that is much the same or greater than that achieved by statin treatment in unfit individuals is moderate and feasible for many middle - aged and older adults , through moderate - intensity physical activity such as walking , gardening and gym classes			1
’ @entity33 and his colleagues assessed the records of 9,700 men and 343 women from @entity51 hospitals in @entity36 and @entity52 in @entity53			0
all had high cholesterol levels or other harmful blood fats and were tested to determine their exercise capacity as least , moderate , fit , or high			0
the researchers found death rates were lowest among those taking statins and who were fit			1
the higher the level of fitness the lower the risk of dying during the median follow - up period of ten years			1
the fittest participants , regardless of whether they were taking statins , had a 60 - 70 per cent lower risk of death			2
the difference could not be explained by age , body mass , ethnicity , sex , history and risk factors of cardiovascular disease and medications , said the study published online in @entity81			0
the fittest participants , regardless of whether they were taking statins , had a significantly lower risk of death of around 60 - 70 per cent professor @entity33 said : ‘ treatment with statins is important , but better fitness improves survival significantly and is a valuable additional treatment or an alternative when statins can not be taken			1
’ @entity91 , of the @entity92 in @entity93 , and @entity94 of @entity95 , also writing in @entity81 , said that prescribing physical activity should be put on a par with drug prescription			0
they said : ‘ the cost of becoming physically active is lower than that of buying drugs and moderate - intensity physical activity has fewer side effects			2
’ side effects linked to statins include muscle pain , which can be disabling in some patients , memory loss , depression , sexual difficulties and depression			0
@entity113 , a gp , author of @entity115 and a sceptic of giving statins to people with a low risk of heart problems , said a recent @entity121 study showed that athletes who wanted to compete could not stay on statins			2
‘ they often find they ca n’t take effective exercise because the statins are harming their muscles and exercise capacity , ’ he said			0
@entity128 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity129 , said : ‘ statins and exercise can help combat high blood cholesterol levels and look after your heart			0
‘ however , this research shows that the two together can provide a winning combination to further improve your heart health , with higher intensity exercise possibly offering more protection			2

being physically fit reduces the risk of dying by two - thirds , @entity3 research says
but combining statins with better fitness may improve survival rates still further
