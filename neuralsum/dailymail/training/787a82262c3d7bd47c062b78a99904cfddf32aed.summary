by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 is hoping his double in @entity6 's 6 - 1 @entity5 thrashing of @entity7 on saturday signalled that his @entity9 career is up and running after a false start			1
the @entity11 international was surprisingly pitched into the first - leg of the @entity15 third qualifier against @entity16 in @entity17 last month by manager @entity18 only a couple of days after signing a six - month loan deal from @entity20			1
the 23 - year - old forward looked out of sorts along with his equally hapless team - mates and was eventually substituted after just an hour of the 4 - 1 defeat			2
get in : @entity2 celebrates scoring his first goal for the club as @entity6 ran out 6 - 1 winners against @entity7 he was left out the starting line - up in the next two games but returned against @entity7 where his brace washed away his @entity32 woes which he put down , in part , to not knowing the names of his team mates			1
' as a footballer you always want to play , ' said @entity2			1
' the manager asked me and i told him i was ready for it , and i was			0
' i do n't think anybody really had their best game there ( @entity32 )			2
' so it is easy to say the new guy had only trained a couple of times , but things could have gone the other way as well			0
' i thought i was ready for it but of course it is easier when you know the names of the players you play with			1
' @entity2 certainly looked more comfortable against @entity7 , defensively hopeless as they were , and indeed he was only thwarted by the crossbar from grabbing a hat - trick			1
friends now : the @entity61 is embraced by @entity62 , and says he now knows he teammates ' names the former @entity66 and @entity67 player said : ' it 's a long time since i scored twice			2
' it was the second game i have started , i feel i 'm getting into it			0
i know all the boys now and i 've settled well			0
' i knew @entity72 ( @entity73 ) from before so that is an easier way into the group but the boys have been good , all of them , so i 've settled in fine			0
' i have already played more games here than i did in @entity20 so that 's a good thing , and scored two goals so that is great			1
' you ca n't say i 've proved myself with one game but it is definitely a step in the right direction and hopefully i 'll get many more goals			2
' it is back to the drawing board for @entity91 's side who contributed massively to their own downfall			0
benched : after his disappointing debut @entity2 had to sit out two games before getting another chance their troubles started in the third minute when @entity6 debutant @entity100 , the 19 - year - old @entity101 defender who arrived on a year - long loan from @entity103 , put the home side in front when @entity7 failed to deal with a @entity107 corner			1
further goals by commons and @entity73 , both also avoidable from the visitors ' point of view , had the points tied up by the interval and stand - in skipper @entity62 claimed a fourth with a nick although that was disputed by @entity116 who curled in the free - kick			0
@entity2 scored either side of a deflected drive by @entity7 captain @entity120 which left @entity91 wondering if the early goal had frightened his team			1
the former @entity124 defender said : ' maybe losing a goal after three minutes spooked a few of our players who have been on the end of it before			0
a bit of fear creeps in			0
' but i 'll make sure the players watch footage of the set - pieces and the goals			0

@entity2 had a *difficult* debut against @entity16 after loan move from @entity20
@entity11 *striker* *admits* he did n't know his fellow players ' names
after being dropped for two matches the forward returned to score twice against @entity7
