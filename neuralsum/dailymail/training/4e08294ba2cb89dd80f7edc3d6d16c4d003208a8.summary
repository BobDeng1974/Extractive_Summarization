by @entity0 published : 12:50 est , 3 february 2014 @entity2 : 16:17 est , 3 february 2014 a @entity4 public high school football coach has been told to stop leading his team in prayers , baptizing players or endorsing religion in any way while on the clock			1
coach @entity11 of @entity12 identifies as a ‘ very proud @entity13 , ’ but that pride won him a reprimand from the school superintendent after a parent ‘ who objects to religious endorsements ’ lodge a complaint about his team prayers			1
a national organization that advocates the separation of church and state even became involved after a @entity25 photo was discovered that allegedly shows @entity11 baptizing students in an indoor swimming pool			1
he and the school superintendent denied this baptism was related to the school or team in any way ‘ it is a violation of the @entity48 for the @entity12 football coach to organize , lead , or participate in prayers or other religious proselytizing before , during , or after games and practices , ’ @entity42 , staff attorney for the @entity44 - based nonprofit @entity43 , wrote in a letter to the school district last fall			1
superintendent @entity55 told the @entity56 that he spoke with @entity11 at the close the football season and ordered him to stop all such religious activities			2
@entity55 said @entity11 ‘ understood ’ he ’d broken rules			0
the superintendent also said it was a mischaracterization to call the pictured incident a ‘ team baptism , ’ though he admitted it was held by a church to which many of the team ’s players belong			0
@entity11 also appears in a video posted to @entity71 in which he leads the team in thanking ‘ the big guy			0
’ according to the letter from the @entity43 , it was just one of many prayers led by @entity11			2
‘ students have reported that coach @entity11 frequently prays with football players at team events and encourages them to go to church and to become baptized , ’ the letter read			1
the coach told the superintendent he ’ll no longer pray with the team			1
‘ i think that would help resolve the issue going forward , ’ @entity55 told the @entity56			0
@entity91 @entity90 affiliate @entity89 spoke to some members of the @entity94 community where the mostly @entity96 residents seem to support @entity11 despite his clash with the @entity48			2
big guy : in addition to the @entity25 baptism photo , the @entity43 pointed to a @entity71 video in which @entity11 leads the team after a win in thanking ' the big guy ' ' i think the man , the coach should be able to pray with his players , pray with his players or anybody else that he wants too , ' said @entity110			1
' that 's our right , we as @entity13 have stood back too long			0
' @entity31 native @entity113 agreed : ' being a @entity96 i have no problem with prayer in school or pray anywhere , ' he said			0
' if a coach was to lead a team in prayer , that 's perfectly fine			0
' upsets me that people , i believe what the @entity123 says , like i said i am a @entity96 , it upsets that some people can just dictate what you do because of their beliefs and not take into consideration your own			0

coach @entity11 at @entity12 in @entity4 has been told he can no longer endorse his @entity96 faith on the clock
the superintendent of schools has *insisted* a student 's @entity136 pictured on @entity25 took place outside campus and not during school hours
a complaint was first lodged by an angry team parent before being picked up by the national @entity43
