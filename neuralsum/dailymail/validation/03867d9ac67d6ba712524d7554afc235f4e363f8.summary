title winner @entity0 will this week start laying the groundwork for a crack at the @entity6 ’s top six - as he aims to take advantage of @entity5 ’ two - month head - start over @entity7 and @entity8			1
the @entity10 boss will summon in agents to draw up new deals for his out - of - contract stars in the team who wrapped up the @entity16 before @entity17 , before turning his attention to luring new players for an assault on the top flight			1
the 34 - year - old believes that by clinching the title so early he has gained a huge advantage over rivals like @entity7 and @entity8 , who will not know until after the play - offs – which run from may 9 to june 2 – what division they will be playing in next season			1
@entity0 believes winning the @entity32 title so early has given @entity5 a big advantage delighted to avoid such a scenario , @entity0 believes @entity35 or @entity36 will risk miss out on landing the best players available			1
@entity0 said : ‘ if you go into the play - offs , you ’re looking at june 2 before you know if you ’re going to be in the championship or the @entity6			1
that ’s a lot of time to take off your planning for the following season			1
with any decent players out there , if you ’re having to wait until june before you can offer them a contract , the good ones will be away			1
‘ so i do think that winning the title so early gives us an advantage			2
we know where we are going so it gives us the opportunity to get going and get in some recruits			2
our pre-season is all planned now , too			2
@entity5 players throw @entity0 in the air after they confirmed their status as champions ‘ we ’re going to speak to the guys who are out of contract , get their agents in and see what we can do			1
there ’s a few coming in this week and the week after that as well			2
it ’s important to try and get them tied up because they have given us so much this season			1
we want to push to get into the top six so if that means altering the squad a little , so be it			1
but everything falls into a budget			2
’ @entity5 strolled to the @entity32 title , losing just once this season , at home to @entity79 in january			1
yet while @entity0 will keep faith with the core of the team who secured him his first trophy as a manager , he warned them they will need to up their game in the top flight			1
‘ we ’re not getting carried away , ’ he said			0
we ’ve just won the championship , but we ’re stepping up to a higher league			0
we definitely need to recruit but the nucleus of the team will stay the same			0
there are great players here , players with great potential , young guys that are doing great and some older players who have been fantastic			1
the @entity5 manager celebrates his side 's league title with club owner @entity104 , who got a standing ovation ‘ we ’ve got guys now who have won a league and that experience will set them up well for the rest of their careers			1
but when you move up a level , you have to up your game a bit as well			0
a lot of preparation will need to be done			0
there are things we got away with this season that we wo n’t get away with next season			1
‘ it will be a different season next year			2
i do n’t expect the kind of season we had this year			2
i was n’t expecting to go so many games undefeated , to have so many wins in a row			0
it will be difficult next season but it ’s my job to make sure we are ready			2
’ @entity0 also praised the structure at @entity5 in which he works as head coach under director of football @entity129 , with chairwoman and owner @entity104 making all the major non-football decisions			1
‘ to be in this structure is great , ’ he said			0
‘ a lot of clubs are doing it down in @entity136 now			0
the majority of foreign clubs have been doing it for the last 10 years			0
so it ’s probably the way football is going nowadays			0
@entity0 believes that @entity8 and @entity7 are at a disadvantage when it comes to preparing for next season ‘ long gone are the days when a manager makes financial decisions about what direction the club ’s going to go in			1
there ’s such a big infrastructure that a coach needs to focus on the football and not deal with the other stuff like board meetings			0
it gives me the opportunity to focus on the things that matter to the players and on their performance on a saturday			2
‘ it was great to see @entity129 and @entity104 get an ovation from the fans at the end today			0
@entity104 ’s come in and given the club a real direction , a togetherness			0
‘ the way she has handled everything , be it the media or the fans , even the football side of it , has been second to none			0
‘ she has put her trust in @entity129 to get the football department together			0
he has then put his trust in me to look after the first team			0
everything has worked out well			0
we just need to use this as a springboard to go and push on			0
i want this to be the beginning of something really good			0
’ @entity35 ( pictured ) and @entity36 have to wait until june to find out which division they will be in			1
