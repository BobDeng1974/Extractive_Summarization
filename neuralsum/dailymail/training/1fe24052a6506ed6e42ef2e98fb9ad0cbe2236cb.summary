by @entity0 published : 11:05 est , 26 february 2014 @entity2 : 15:11 est , 26 february 2014 a group of @entity5 teenagers filmed a boy and a girl posing as a boyfriend abusing his partner to see if ‘ the man on the street ’ would intervene			1
the experiment follows on from the viral video showing a freezing boy at a @entity16 bus stop where a majority of people offered up their clothes for the shivering child			1
however , the @entity5 were not as kind as their @entity22 neighbours when it came to a young woman being subjected to threats and violence			1
mr @entity38 was filmed in several locations , in a park and on busy streets , pretending to mentally and pysically abuse their friend @entity44 , posing as his ’ girlfriend ’			1
shockingly , it is not until a minute into the video that a lone man interrupts the experiment when se sees mr @entity38 grabbing and slapping his ‘ partner ’ on a park bench			2
before this , a group of young women , stronger than mr @entity38 in numbers , are filmed walking past the ‘ arguing couple ' , and although they look , they do nothing			2
in the video , mr @entity38 can be heard shouting things such as ‘ you know what you 've done ! ’ , i ’m going to kill you ! ’ and ‘ are you not listening to what i ’m telling you ? ! ’ while also being physically abusive against his pretend partner			0
watch more on @entity69 ' if i do n't look it 's not there ' : the two witnesses on the park bench barely glance at the young couple as the boy slaps her and shouts verbal abuse shocking : the young woman to the left has just unlocked her bike from right behind the ' arguing couple ' , but does nothing to stop the abuse exposing the truth : @entity38 and @entity39 , both 18 , filmed the video on @entity40 where mr @entity38 pretended to abuse his ' girlfriend ' , a friend of theirs , in public in the description on their @entity69 page the pair explains : ‘ this experiment was filmed on @entity40 as this day represents love between two people			1
‘ unfortunately , not all live in a healthy relationship , but rather one in which they are subjected to violence			0
‘ we wanted to see how people here in @entity5 would react to a young lady being threatened and subjected to physical violence			1
’ mr @entity38 who runs @entity69 channel @entity102 with mr @entity39 , said a majority of people who stopped him were women			0
‘ a quarter of witnesses helped out , a majority of which were younger women , ’ mr @entity38 told @entity108			0
‘ there were also a lot of older women who said something , but did not physically confront me , which is understandable			0
‘ i do n't think this behaviour is specific for @entity5 , i think people across western society are scared of taking responsibility			1
‘ personally i think we have a responsibility to stop this , like myself and @entity39 for example , we are just two teenagers who do these videos for no financial benefit , just in hope of changing the way people think			0
’ hero : a lone man intervenes in a park , and pushes the ' boyfriend ' away from the girl @entity138 restored : a witness walks in between the pair to stop the pretend abuse the pair were disappointed that so few intervened and shocked that a majority of people simply walked past , doing nothing			1
this includes the jawdropping moment towards the end when a woman towards the end when the pair are arguing in front of a row of parked bikes , who unlocks her bike next to the arguing pair and almost has to nudge them out of the way to get it out			0
earlier in the video , mr @entity38 subjects @entity44 to physical and verbal abuse next to two people sitting on a bench who do not even appear to acknowledge the fighting ‘ couple ’			1
‘ i grew up with women and have a huge respect for them and staged this experiment to see how people would react , ’ mr @entity38 told @entity164			2
‘ i wanted to see if , for example , my little sister can feel safe on the street in that situation			0
‘ it was disappointing to see so few intervene and so many people just walk past , including grown men			2
‘ i was standing there saying “ i ’m going to kill you , ’ and two girls next to us just hurried off			0
is it really going to take a black eye for people to react ? ’			0
