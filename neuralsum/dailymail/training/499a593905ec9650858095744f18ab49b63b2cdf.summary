@entity1 's self - destructing message service is now available internationally , just a week after officially launching in the @entity2 called @entity4 , it is designed to appeal to fans of @entity6 and other messaging apps that let people send self - destructing messages to friends			1
however , the app adds a novel twist , as users can not see a friend 's picture until they send one back			1
it allows people to send messages to friends ( pictured left ) , but they can only view them if they send a message back			1
the app also allows people to react to an image ( right ) after downloading the app , you can sign up either with a @entity1 account or your mobile phone number			1
you add contacts based on your @entity1 friends and phone contacts			2
opening the app takes you to its camera , which has a ' shoot ' button for taking a snapshot and a ' selfie ' button			0
after taking a photo , you can type a message of up to 140 characters on it , draw a picture or send a 15 - second video			0
you can then send it to some , or all , of your @entity4 contacts			2
on @entity4 , you can see a message only if you send one back			1
until you do , you 'll only see a pixelated preview of what 's in store			0
' with @entity4 , we wanted to build something where everybody is a creator and nobody is just a spectator , ' @entity1 said			1
' when everyone participates , there ’s less pressure , more creativity and even the little things in life can turn into awesome shared experiences			0
this is what @entity4 is all about			2
' @entity4 draws inevitable comparisons to @entity6			1
@entity1 even tried to buy @entity6 's maker for $ 3 billion , if reports are to be believed			1
but the two messaging services are different			0
unlike @entity6 , there is no time limit on when a @entity4 message disappears			1
once a person looks at a message , they can flick it off to the side of their screen so that it self destructs			0
@entity4 also allows reaction shots			2
it splits a user 's screen in half and lets them snap a photo to return to the sender			0
the recipient does n't have to send back a message to view the response			1
slingshot works with both @entity93 and @entity95 devices - on @entity96 and @entity95 @entity97 and @entity98			0
a @entity1 account is n't required to use the new app. ' photos and videos that do n’t stick around forever allow for sharing that ’s more expressive , raw and spontaneous , ' said @entity1			1
the app shows a pixelated preview ( left ) until a ' sling ' message is sent , at which point it is unlocked ( right ) ' we can connect the same way we like to live : in the moment			0
we ’ve enjoyed using @entity6 to send each other ephemeral messages and expect there to be a variety of apps that explore this new way of sharing			2
' with @entity4 , we saw an opportunity to create something new and different : a space where you can share everyday moments with lots of people at once			0
' ten people have been working on slingshot since january			0
it grew out of a december hackathon at @entity1 where people were trying to figure out out ' new ways of sharing '			0
slingshot is the second app to come out of @entity1 's @entity135 , an internal project designed to develop separate apps in a start - up - like environment			1
the first app from the lab was @entity142 , a social news reader that came out in february			0
the effort comes as @entity1 seeks to broaden its reach beyond its 1.28 billion users by splintering off some of its functions to separate apps - and creating stand - alone apps for entirely new features and audiences .			2

a week after its @entity2 launch , @entity1 has rolled out its new @entity4 app
users can not see their friends ' pictures until they send one back
once messages are *swiped* off screen , they self destruct
a @entity1 account is not needed to use the app , which is designed to rival @entity6 's service and also offers ' reaction ' photos
