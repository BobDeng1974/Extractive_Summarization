by @entity0 published : 07:01 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 07:46 est , 8 august 2013 ' it does n't matter how old you are , ' says @entity4 make - up artist @entity3			1
' anyone and everyone can wear it			2
' for those not up to speed with @entity10 teen trends , @entity8 is all about looking hyper - cute , doll - like even , and it 's fast becoming popular here - both with teens and older women			1
but i 'm not convinced			2
i 'm at the @entity16 show in @entity18 's @entity17 being transformed into a ' @entity8 ' girl , which in my case , means lashings of glitter , a pink wig and a frilly dress of the sort @entity26 would be proud of			1
it 's certainly not my usual look			2
girly : @entity0 in her pink wig - complete with detachable bunches - and a dress @entity26 would love frilly : artist @entity26 is a big fan of flouncy @entity8 style dresses the antithesis of fake - tanned hair - extensioned @entity44 chic , @entity8 girls like pink , kitsch , tutus , delicate dabs of glitter , enormous false lashes and ultra pale skin			1
the most common @entity8 style is named the ' classic @entity46 ' , which despite referencing the @entity48 novel in the name , has nothing to do with looking sexy and everything to do with achieving a look that is as cute , girlish and pretty as possible			1
based on frilled and furbelowed @entity56 styles combined with a hint of goth , girls hope to achieve a porcelain - doll look using lashings of lace , ribbon , bows , ruffles , bloomers , aprons , and ruffled petticoats			2
then there 's the ' @entity46 ' look			2
featuring even more ribbons , bows , and lace , than the ' @entity46 ' , it leaves out the gothic elements in favour of pastels			2
@entity75 is also popular and involves giant bow headdresses or bonnets , teamed with lighter , less extreme make - up			1
not surprisingly , the prettiness of @entity8 has won it legions of fans among @entity84 teens - many of whom have turned up at @entity85 , pretty in their lilac wigs and supersized falsies			1
at 28 , i 'm more than a decade older than most of them , and at 5ft 8 " , considerably taller to boot			2
i do n't wear pink and i certainly do n't do wacky wigs			1
nevertheless , @entity3 , and her colleague @entity92 , are confident that it wo n't take much to turn me into a fully fledged @entity8 girl			2
we kick off with make - up			2
lots of make - up			2
as i 'm going to be a @entity46 , that means a fresh - looking pale base and lots of pink blusher			1
then there 's my eyes which get several washes of pink eyeshadow , black and white liner and a frosting of glitter			1
then @entity92 takes over to add false lashes so heavy , my eyes semi-close followed by tiny diamante hearts at the corners of my eyes and dotted along my lashline			0
but make - up alone just is n't enough , so i 'm whisked away to be fitted up for a wig			1
the wig they choose is bright bubblegum pink and comes with detachable bunches			1
like the falsies , it 's heavy			0
finally , we go hunting for a dress			0
the one @entity92 eventually picks is - of course - bright pink and comes with a sash , a tutu and a frilly lace neckline			1
am i done yet ? @entity0 checks out her thickly applied @entity8 make - up - complete with tiny heart gems and pose ! the writer gets into character with the help of a kawaii - inspired pouting selfie crazy : without the wig , the @entity8 look is prettier , and according to @entity3 , is great for evenings out fully dressed , i survey myself in a mirror held up by @entity92 and barely recognise myself			1
i look like a cross between @entity26 and a toddler			0
it 's fun but i 'm not convinced this is the look for me so i take it outside for a second opinion			0
on the way out , i 'm stopped by a woman on her way into the show			0
' i just love your look , ' she smiles			0
' i think you 're very brave			0
' then i find a pair of workmen , who break into smirks as i approach			0
' what do you think ? ' i ask , giving them a twirl			0
' you look great , love , ' says one smiling kindly at me			0
' speak for yourself ! ' sniggers his friend			0
hmmm - not quite the reaction i was hoping for			0
back inside , i meet pint - sized j - pop duo , @entity161			0
dressed in elaborate mini-kimonos teamed with clompy boots and twirling feathery fans , to my untrained eyes , the pair have a @entity167 look themselves			0
as soon as i walk through the door , they 're exclaiming about by enormous eyelashes			0
' your lashes are so cool ! ' they chorus			0
the real deal : @entity161 ( left ) and a proper @entity8 girl at @entity16 ( right ) they too are very cool , their diminutive frames proving the perfect foil for their quirky - cool look which , they tell me , is n't kawaii but another style sub-set called ' kimono cosplay ' , which involves @entity185 cartoon inspired clothes made with kimono fabric			1
by now , my hairline is becoming itchy thanks to the wig , so i wave goodbye to @entity190 and @entity191 and head back to @entity3 and @entity92 to hand back my @entity8 get - up			1
relieved of my wig and dress , i instantly feel better , strolling round to see @entity16 's sushi stalls and geisha performances without feeling like a goth at a football match			1
so could i be a @entity8 girl ? while i learned to love my pink blusher and eyeshadow and enjoyed pirouetting around in glitter galore , it 's just too girly and i 'm definitely too old			1
what looks sweet on a teenager looks babyish on me , so i 'll be giving the frills and furbelows a miss along with the heavy , luridly coloured wigs			0
madly creative and very , very pretty , @entity8 is n't great for the over- 20s but looks gorgeous on girls			0
@entity8 , which translates as ' adorable ' , is a @entity10 sub-culture which places emphasis on being as cute as possible			1
although the best known aspect of @entity8 is the kitsch fashion , @entity8 girls and boys also apply the concept to the way they live and behave			0
while it looks similar to other @entity10 cultural phenomena such as @entity220 , @entity8 girls have a more doll - like appearance , with big doe - eyes , pastel - coloured make - up and colourful hair			1
kawaii fashion is based on @entity56 fashion , with wearers intent on looking cute , innocent and pretty courtesy of lace , ribbons , bows , ruffles and aprons			1
the most common form of @entity8 is the @entity46 , which has subsets , including the @entity46 , which has even more ribbons , bows , and lace , and @entity75 , which often includes giant bow headdresses or bonnets			0
because @entity8 is a lifestyle rather than a purely fashion phenomenon , certain behaviour such as high pitched voices and girly giggles are expected of those who embrace it			0
in the @entity84 , the majority of @entity8 girls are teens , although in @entity85 , many are much older			1
a study by cosmetic company @entity250 found that women in their 20s and 30s actively attempt to achieve the cute look , which is considered the beauty ideal by both men and women in @entity85 .			2

kawaii is a @entity10 teen trend that *focuses* on being as cute as possible
trend is becoming *increasingly* popular among @entity84 teens
