@entity7 waged a three - year battle with @entity9 , which has now agreed to move her family on safety grounds			1
the local authority hope that , by giving way before a court appeal was heard , it would avoid setting a legal precedent which would open the floodgates for demands for moves from high - rise flats			0
new home : mother @entity7 won a battle against @entity9 to get moved from a tower block as it was dangerous to live there mrs @entity26 has lived in the flat in @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , for seven years			1
she said : ' this is such a relief			0
the ninth floor is no place to bring up young children			2

' battle : mrs @entity26 said : ' i dare not even go into another room			0
i told the council it would be responsible if a child fell ' a council spokesman said the decision was not binding on others			1
