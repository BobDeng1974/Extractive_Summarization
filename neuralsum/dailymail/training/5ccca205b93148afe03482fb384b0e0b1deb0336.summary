by @entity0 for @entity1 he is known for his seriously masculine roles in action blockbusters such as the @entity6 franchise			2
so it 's perhaps no surprise that @entity9 has been voted @entity11 's ' manliest man ' in a national survey - a fact that will surely delight his girlfriend , @entity15 @entity14			1
the 47 - year - old actor gained a quarter of the votes , beating the likes of footballer @entity19 , 300 star @entity20 and even original tough guy , @entity21			1
the 36 - year - old actor , who also played @entity38 in @entity40 film @entity41 , got 10 per cent of the votes , followed jointly by @entity19 and @entity20 , who both got eight per cent			1
at the other end of the scale , prince @entity43 polled just one per cent of the votes , along with @entity48 's @entity47			1
and it seems sporting success does not deem a man manly , as olympians @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 also all polled one per cent or less			2
further down the scale : footballer @entity19 ( left ) polled eight per cent of the votes while prince @entity43 only managed one per cent @entity9 ( 24 % ) @entity21 ( 18 % ) @entity32 ( 10 % ) @entity20 ( 8 % ) @entity19 ( 8 % ) @entity58 ( 7 % ) @entity59 ( 5 % ) @entity60 ( 5 % ) @entity61 ( 3 % ) @entity62 ( 3 % ) @entity63 ( 2 % ) prince @entity43 ( 1 % ) @entity64 ( 1 % ) @entity47 ( 1 % ) @entity52 ( 1 % ) @entity54 ( less than 1 % ) @entity65 ( less than 1 % ) @entity66 ( less than 1 % ) @entity53 ( less than 1 % ) @entity67 ( less than 1 % ) @entity68 ( less than 1 % ) the celebrity list comes ahead of an opportunity to enter the men in your life into a ' manliest man ' competition			1
@entity77 magazine and men 's cancer charity orchid have teamed up with male grooming brand @entity81 to launch a campaign to find @entity11 's @entity83			1
if you think a man in your life has got what it takes to win , you can enter your your husband , boyfriend or father - while self - confident men can even enter themselves			0
the winner will be chosen by an expert panel and will secure a year 's modeling contract to become the face of @entity81 , and be in with a chance to feature in @entity76			0
it might seem frivolousness but the competition has a serious message behind it as it aims to raise awareness of testicular cancer			2
more than 43,000 men are diagnosed every year in the @entity104 with testicular , prostate and penile cancer			0
the @entity109 competition is encouraging men across @entity11 to ' @entity111 and @entity112 ' for the early signs and symptoms of the disease			2
@entity116 , chief executive of @entity117 , said : ' every day 6 men in the @entity104 aged 15 - 45 will be diagnosed with testicular cancer			0
' despite these statistics over 70 per cent of men still do nâ€™t know how to examine themselves			0
' even more alarmingly , a further 20 per cent have never even thought about self - examining			0
' we want to change this with the help of the @entity125 competition			0

@entity6 actor , who dates @entity14 , *topped* poll
followed by actors @entity21 , @entity32 and @entity20
prince @entity43 polled just one per cent of votes
now *readers* can *nominate* the men in their lives as ' @entity11 's manliest '
@entity77 competition is to raise awareness of male cancers
