not even @entity0 could find a way through , nor could @entity2 or @entity3			0
@entity4 simply could not unlock the door			1
it was a ruthless lock - out – another triumph for the wolf - pack			1
@entity10 ’ fabled defence left their @entity12 rivals without a point in front of their own supporters at the @entity17 last friday night , while accumulating 39 of their own in a stunning @entity21 mis - match			1
it was the latest herculean feat founded on @entity24 ’s succinct instructions to the players , as they prepare to go into ‘ monster ’ mode			1
‘ ” go get ‘ em ” ; that ’s the message , ’ he said			0
‘ ” go get ‘ em ; be aggressive ”			0
people are confrontational in attack , so to counter that we have to be confrontational in defence			2
@entity37 is a physical game of chess – you are fighting for space and territory			0
the task for a defence is to take space away from an attack , put them under pressure then hopefully you get turn - overs			2
@entity24 , defence and forwards coach for @entity10 , is interviewed by @entity52 's @entity51 @entity24 was a confrontational flanker at @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity10 @entity55 breaks free with the ball during the @entity12 derby between @entity4 and @entity10 ‘ the whole principle is , “ go get ‘ em , we want the ball back ”			1
in defence , the system requires clarity of thought because you need to make good decisions			2
but when the collision happens , you have to release the monster ; you have to get angry and be physical to knock that person back			0
’ saracens are a team who can win big games even when they have very little possession , such is their ability to soak up long spells of pressure			0
it was evident against @entity4 and notably last season in their @entity80 quarter - final victory over @entity81 in @entity82			1
their defence is founded on aggressive intent – on a collective mind - set and work - rate – but @entity24 has elevated the whole concept by giving it an identity of its own			1
‘ the idea of the “ wolf - pack ” just came out in a team meeting one day , in quite an organic way , ’ he said			1
‘ we were talking about wanting to go out and hunt them , go out and get them , hunt them like a pack , and it just came into my head , “ hunt them like a pack of wolves ”			2
‘ i quite liked it and spoke with the boys about wolf howling – it was quite a vibrant meeting , as you can imagine ! we decided to roll with it and i had some t - shirts knocked up			2
in the first year they said “ raised by wolves ” , next year we were “ born to be wild ” and next year it was “ hungry like the wolf ”			0
it has continued and it is an easy thing for the boys to talk about			0
’ @entity4 suffered an emphatic 39 - 0 defeat to @entity120 on friday night as @entity121 ran riot @entity123 of @entity10 crosses the line to score against @entity4 at the @entity17 innovation is something @entity10 pride themselves on and it extends to coaching methods as well as a broader club out - look			1
last year , @entity24 brought a pair of wolves into training , which caught the players off - guard and certainly grabbed their attention			1
there may be similar stunts in the offing as he said : ‘ we have n’t had any animals in for a while but we ’ll try to amend that maybe ! we were talking about a few ideas the other day			0
it ’s never dull here ; it ’s never dull at all			0
’ while the pack mentality relies on a unified will to chase , tackle , pressurise and hold the line , there are those at the heart of it who make it all tick as defensive leaders			0
@entity24 pinpoints three key men ; @entity156 and @entity157 – the two abrasive openside flankers – and @entity159			1
the @entity161 centre leads @entity10 at @entity54 on saturday and the defence guru delivered an emphatic endorsement of his worth to the club , in the knowledge that his virtues are sometimes overlooked in the endless debate about the best midfield combination for the national team			1
‘ for me , unequivocally , @entity159 is the best centre in @entity161 bar none , ’ he said			1
‘ he should be one of the first names down on an @entity161 team - sheet			1
‘ we are very lucky to have him			0
he has an unbelievably low error rate , he is incredibly physical as a ball - carrier and he is the best defensive centre in @entity178 – i do n’t think there is much debate about that			2
@entity161 and @entity184 8 @entity183 is tackled by @entity4 hooker @entity185 @entity161 skipper @entity186 of @entity4 is tackled by @entity187 of @entity10 ‘ not only is he a good defender , he is effective over the ball and gets us some key turn - overs , and his attacking game has grown			1
he ’s got good , soft hands and puts in some deft little kicks , but that goes unnoticed because he has been pigeon - holed as not being a ball - player , which i think is unfair			0
’ in his own playing days , @entity24 was an energetic , confrontational flanker at @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity10			1
he has taken his on - field persona into his work as a coach , to great effect			2
in june last year , he fulfilled a temporary role in @entity202 ’s @entity161 set - up , while @entity203 was on @entity205 duty in @entity206			1
it was a clear sign of his rising status and at some point , he would welcome a more permanent opportunity at @entity211			0
‘ i was very fortunate that @entity202 asked me to do it and that @entity10 allowed me that opportunity , ’ he said			2
‘ i had a great time			0
it was a challenge working with different players from different backgrounds , with different wants and needs , and difficult foibles and idiosyncrasies			0
‘ we did a good job , we got the players buying into what we were doing and we got the first series win in @entity225			0
i loved it and down the road , of course i would love it if that opportunity presented itself again , but at the moment they have a great coaching group			0
‘ at some stage i might get that chance but if it ’s not with @entity161 , who knows ? it might be with another country , or i might be head coach somewhere , or i might still be at @entity10 , doing what we are doing			1
’ what they are doing today is trying to guard against any complacency after ‘ nilling ’ @entity4			2
that should n’t be a significant danger because @entity54 beat them at @entity241 last season and in @entity243 the season before , so the @entity245 have proved more adept than most at breaking free from the wolf - pack ’s suffocating grip			1
@entity24 remembers every try his side concede in forensic detail			2
he wants to stop them , so he will send @entity253 out at the @entity254 with those same simple but effective orders			0
‘ go get ‘ em ’ .			0
