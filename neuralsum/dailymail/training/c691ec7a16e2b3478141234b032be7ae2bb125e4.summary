five teams competing for the $ 30 million @entity1 have been awarded a total of $ 5.25 million for meeting key mission milestones			1
the groups are all hoping to develop a robot that can land safely on the moon , travel 1,640ft ( 500 metres ) on its surface , and send two ' @entity9 ' back to the @entity10			1
among them is a small start - up from @entity13 , dubbed @entity14 , who has no experience in robotics , but has nevertheless managed to grab a $ 1 million of the prize			1
pictured is @entity23 's entry			0
it hopes to fund the development of its lunar landing by offering to take items to them moon - with prices ranging from $ 460 to $ 26,000 @entity32 - based @entity14 has gone up against companies such as @entity34 which is billionaire - funded and has received a number of technologies from @entity37 to get a head start			1
according to @entity40 , co-founder : ' the @entity14 moon mission can cost us anywhere between $ 30 million and $ 40 million , depending on the cost of the launch vehicle			2
' and this is money that will have to be raised through sponsorships , prizes and crowdfunding â€“ a daunting task			0
@entity51 is designing a ' @entity53 ' system , consisting of two - wheeled ' @entity54 ' and four - wheeled ' @entity55 ' @entity56 ( @entity57 , @entity58 ) : imaging ( $ 250,000 ) , @entity60 ( $ 500,000 ) , @entity61 ( $ 1 million ) @entity51 ( @entity62 ) : mobility ( $ 500,000 ) @entity34 ( @entity64 , @entity58 ) : imaging ( $ 250,000 ) , landing ( $ 1 million ) part - time scientists ( @entity67 ) : imaging ( $ 250,000 ) , @entity60 ( $ 500,000 ) @entity14 ( @entity13 ) : landing ( $ 1 million ) the other teams to gain a share of the prize included @entity56 , @entity51 , @entity34 and part - time scientists			1
@entity23 hopes to fund the development of its lunar landing by offering to take items to them moon - with prices ranging from $ 460 to $ 26,000			2
the firm , which has dubbed the service @entity81 , says it can even offer to give over entire missions for larger items that need more shipping space			0
they plan to launch on a @entity87 rocket			0
after achieving low @entity10 orbit , the @entity89 second stage re-ignites for trans - lunar injection ( @entity92 ) to propel @entity56 's spacecraft into a 4.5 - day cruise to the moon			1
part - time scientists has designed a rover that relies on three imaging systems			1
the two outer cameras provide stereoscopic vision for navigation			0
the center one will provide the high - definition colour imagery the @entity1 aims to do something we have n't done as humanity since 1973 - land on the surface of the moon			2
' more than half of the world 's population has never had the opportunity to view a live transmission from the lunar surface , ' say the organisers			0
the prize aims to create a new ' @entity119 ' moment for this generation and to spur continuous lunar exploration with $ 40 million in incentive based prizes			0
in order to win this money , a private company must land safely on the surface of the @entity127 , travel 640ft ( 500 metres ) on its surface , and send two signals back to the @entity10			1
the system consists of two spacecraft , a lander and the @entity134 rover ; lander and rover exist as a single spacecraft until touchdown on the lunar surface			0
@entity51 , meanwhile , is designing a ' @entity53 ' system , consisting of two - wheeled ' @entity54 ' and four - wheeled ' @entity55			2
' the two rovers are linked by a tether so that @entity54 can be lowered into craters on the moon 's surface			0
part - time scientists from @entity67 has designed a rover that relies on three imaging systems			1
the two outer cameras provide stereoscopic vision for navigation			0
the center one , meanwhile , will provide the high - definition colour imagery			0
finally , @entity34 has created the ' mx ' - family of scalable landers which it claims are capable of reaching the lunar surface and other destinations from @entity10 orbit on direct or low - energy trajectories			1
@entity34 has created the ' mx ' - family of scalable landers which it claims are capable of reaching the lunar surface and other destinations from @entity10 orbit on direct or low - energy trajectories ' the $ 30 million @entity1 is asking teams to accomplish a feat that has never been achieved , ' said @entity164 , vice chairman and president , @entity166 ' the goal of this unprecedented competition is to challenge and inspire engineers and entrepreneurs from around the world to develop low - cost methods of robotic space exploration			1
' for each @entity176 category , teams carried out a number of hardware tests representative of their planned lunar mission , while sharing design information and analysis with the judging panel			2
last year @entity184 and @entity185 today announced that the networks will serve as television homes for the @entity1			0
they will follow the entire process including testing , lift - off , and live coverage of the winning lunar landing , due to take place in december 2016			0
among the winners s a small start - up from @entity13 , dubbed @entity14 , who has no experience in robotics , but has nevertheless managed to grab $ 1 million of the prize pictured is an overview of @entity14 ' goals			1
@entity40 , co-founder said : ' the @entity14 moon mission can cost us anywhere between $ 30 million and $ 40 million , depending on the cost of the launch vehicle '			2

five teams were given total of $ 5.25m for meeting mission milestones
the groups are all hoping to develop a robot that can land on the moon , travel 1,640ft ( 500 metres ) , and send two ' @entity9 ' back to @entity10
winners include an @entity13 start up with no prior experience of robotics
