by @entity0 communication : the @entity3 leader has been told he needs to use more ' direct language ' to win over voters @entity6 needs to use more ‘ direct language ’ to win over voters , one of his closest frontbench allies has said			1
@entity3 ’s deputy chairman @entity11 said his leader needs to communicate in ‘ primary colours ’ and reflect the way voters talk if the party is to win the general election			1
he is the latest in a long line of @entity3 figures to call for mr @entity6 to speak more clearly			1
a growing number of @entity21 are concerned that his sometimes ponderous professorial prognostications about political abstractions are proving a turn - off for the public - concerns that have grown as @entity3 ’s poll lead has shrunk			1
in an interview with the @entity28 , mr @entity11 said the party needed to ‘ communicate in the most direct language we possibly can and in primary colours ’			1
he added : ‘ strong , plain language , in primary colours , is part of a spectrum of communication techniques which any modern party [ has to ] use			1
’ ‘ @entity3 needs to speak with all the accents and dialects and different rhythms of speech which the @entity44 and the @entity45 speak with			1
’ mr @entity11 , a shadow minister without portfolio - a post designed to leave him free to act as an attack dog -- praised mr @entity6 for promoting frontbenchers with regional accents			1
‘ that is what @entity6 is assembling together , whether it is @entity53 or @entity54 [ @entity55 ] or @entity56 [ @entity57 ]			2
each speaks in a different accent in a different way			0
’ but he made clear there is also an onus on mr @entity6 to make himself more clearly understood			2
mr @entity11 said : ‘ it is up to his whole team , including me , that we get out more often and make the case for big change , radical transformation and a reconnection with those people who left @entity3			1
’ he spoke out after former cabinet minister @entity71 said mr @entity6 had to start ‘ talking in normal human language ’			1
@entity74 @entity73 has twice gone public to rail against mr @entity6 ’s speaking style and his keenness in speeches on political theory and non-specfic slogans			0
advice : @entity3 's deputy chairman @entity11 said his leader needs to communicate in ' primary colours ' ‘ our communication has to be much stronger , ’ mr @entity73 argued			1
‘ i think we have to move beyond abstract concepts like “ one nation ”			2
’ @entity89 mp @entity88 said : ‘ when your own appointed “ attack dog ” starts attacking the leadership , you know the @entity3 are is complete disarray			2
‘ @entity6 ca n’t communicate to the hardworking people of @entity45 because he has no long term plan for the country			2
he only offers more spending , more borrowing and more taxes , exactly what got us into a mess in the first place			0
’ @entity104 used a speech last night to suggest that the @entity45 should stay in the @entity106 mr @entity11 appeared to claim that his comments had been taken out of context			1
last night he tweeted : ‘ evidently you have n’t bothered to read the details			2
typical @entity89 never let the facts get in the way of an attack line			0
’ meanwhile @entity104 used a speech last night to argue that @entity45 must stay in the @entity106			0
in a speech to the @entity117 annual conference , the @entity115 sought to rebuild links with business leaders who are sceptical of @entity3 ’s economic credentials			0
wooing businessmen who want to stay in the @entity106 , he said : ‘ we are clear that there is no future for @entity45 in walking away from our biggest market			0
‘ we believe @entity45 is better placed to shape @entity127 ’s future , and back @entity45 business , jobs and our national interest , if we are fully engaged rather than having one foot out of the door			0
’ mr @entity104 , who is widely credited with keeping @entity45 out of the euro when he was @entity133 ’s adviser , sought to make a virtue of @entity6 ’s refusal to back an in - out referendum			0
he said : ‘ we would hold an in - out referendum if there was a further transfer of powers - a prospect we believe is possible , but unlikely in the next @entity142			0
not an arbitrary timetable for a referendum , which puts @entity89 party politics before the national economic interest , and is creating huge uncertainty for business			0
‘ to walk away from our @entity106 membership would be reckless , foolish and deeply damaging			0
it would be anti-investment , anti-jobs and anti-business			0

@entity11 said his leader needs to communicate in ‘ primary colours ’
@entity155 's deputy chairman is latest figure asking leader to speak more clearly
growing number of *mps* concerned his abstractions are a turn off
