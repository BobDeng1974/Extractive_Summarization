the new images released wednesday are courtesy of a newly - launched @entity11 - @entity10 satellite that 's equipped with a sensor to observe the planet at night			1
the satellite , @entity15 , was launched on october 28 , 2011			1
where @entity29 is gleaming with city lights , @entity28 has hardly any lights at all illuminated : lights across the earth are pictured in this @entity11 handout satellite image the light fantastic : the @entity38 is pictured left with a night time view of @entity41 over @entity42 , right there 's the @entity38 bathed in city lights			1
a map of the @entity19 shows the populated @entity18 illuminated			2
light from fishing boats can also be pinpointed			0
' for all the reasons that we need to see @entity7 during the day , we also need to see @entity7 at night , ' @entity50 , a researcher at @entity10 's @entity51 , said in a @entity11 statement			1
' unlike humans , the @entity7 never sleeps			0
' @entity50 added : ' it 's like having three simultaneous low - light cameras operating at once and we pick the best of various cameras , depending on where we 're looking in the scene			0
' going global : this image obtained from @entity11 shows the entire @entity7 assembled from data acquired by the @entity15 satellite @entity64 : @entity65 can be seen as it gained strength before it pummeled the @entity18 in october fire light : this image captures a night time view of the @entity73 wildfires in @entity74 in this august 29 , 2012 satellite image from @entity11 ' the instrument can capture images on nights with or without moonlight , producing crisp views of @entity7 's atmosphere , land and ocean surfaces			1
the satellite also captured the glow from natural sources including moonlight , northern lights and naturally - occurring fires			0
after @entity65 made landfall in late october , hard - hit @entity91 , lower @entity92 and the @entity93 appeared dark in the satellite images compared with surrounding areas - the result of widespread power outages that plagued the region for days and weeks following the storm			2
@entity100 , program scientist for @entity10 's @entity101 , said : ' @entity10 's @entity102 is continuing to explore the use of the day - night band			0
the very high resolution from @entity107 data will take forecasting weather events at night to a much higher level			0
