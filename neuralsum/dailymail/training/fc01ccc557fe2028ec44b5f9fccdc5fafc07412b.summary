by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 has offered dubious support to @entity4 - the football manager accused of sending racist texts - insisting : ' he has n't murdered anyone , he has n't raped anyone and he is not a paedophile			1
' the @entity10 manager made the controversial remark days after it was claimed @entity4 had exchanged a series of racist , sexist and homophobic text messages with @entity15 while they were at @entity17			1
mr @entity2 believes the @entity18 should be given the chance to redeem himself , adding : ' he 's made a mistake and it should n't end his football career			1
' what he has said has no benefit at all			0
i do n't know what is in @entity2 's head when he 's saying that			1
' ( @entity4 's alleged comments ) have anti-semitic and racial connotations and at the end of the day it 's affecting a group of people and we should be more respectful of those people			1
' what @entity2 has said shows a lack of understanding about the situation			0
these are really sensitive issues and you have to respect the reasons behind them			0
he 's almost saying ' it ai n't that bad is it ? ' , but unfortunately for some people , it is			0
' the text exchanges outlined in the @entity68 's exclusive report date back to when @entity4 and @entity15 worked as manager and head of recruitment at @entity17 , before both were sacked by club owner @entity73 amid claims of over-spending in the transfer market			1
@entity4 's agent @entity77 later told @entity78 that he was ' shocked and stunned ' after details of the texts were released			2
the @entity81 said the club had searched more than 10,000 private text messages and found two from @entity4 adding , intially , that they were ' with the benefit of hindsight , very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures '			1
one of the texts he and @entity15 are alleged to have shared said : ' he 's a snake , a gay snake			2
not to be trusted ' , referring to an official at another club former @entity92 manager @entity2 says he acknowledges that @entity4 and @entity15 had made a ' big mistake ' but that @entity4 was a ' great fella , a family man , a football man '			1
@entity2 , pictured , acknowledged that @entity4 and @entity15 had made a ' big mistake ' but that @entity4 was a ' great fella , a family man , a football man ' he added : ‘ suddenly everybody 's an angel			1
it should n't finish his life he 's a top manager and i feel really sorry for him			2
‘ i 'm not condoning what he 's done but he 's not a bad person , he 's a fantastic lad			0
show me somebody who 's never made a mistake and i ’ll show you a liar			2
‘ he 's not a rapist , he 's not a paedophile			0
he 's made a mistake and it should n't end his football career			1
‘ i 'm lucky i do n’t send text messages but i do get silly message with sick jokes on them from time to time			1
’ @entity4 was set to be named as the new @entity120 manager before he dropped out of the running after the club learned of the evidence that was passed to the @entity124			2
there 's enough dogs in @entity17 for us all to go around			2
' on the arrival of @entity132 international @entity131 ' go on , fat @entity133 like a jew that sees money slipping through his fingers ' on football agent @entity139 ' he 's a snake , a gay snake			0
not to be trusted ' on an official of another club ' not many white faces amongst that lot but worth considering			0
' on a list of potential signings ' i hope she 's looking after your needs			0
i bet you 'd love a bounce on her falsies			0
' on a player 's female agent a picture entitled @entity158 ( where every square was a " @entity161 " square ) sent to members of @entity17 's staff @entity15 , meanwhile , resigned from his position as @entity120 ’s sporting director			1
on thursday , the @entity81 issued a statement on behalf of @entity4 - before a backlash forced them into a humbling apology			0
the original statement read : ‘ in the course of a search by the club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff , it emerged that @entity177 had , it seems , sent a couple of one - line texts that were , with the benefit of hindsight , very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures			1
‘ these were two text messages sent in private at a time @entity177 felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter			2
’ @entity4 , pictured right with @entity15 , was set to be named as the new @entity120 manager before he dropped out of the running after the club learned of the evidence that was passed to the @entity124 but less than 24 hours later , a second statement was released : ' the @entity81 apologises for some of its wording , in its release yesterday , which was inappropriate and has been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist , sexist or homophobic nature			1
that was certainly not our intention			0
' it is beyond argument that any comments that are discriminatory , even used in private , are totally unacceptable			0
' the @entity81 will not be commenting further on the allegations relating to @entity4 whilst the @entity124 conducts its investigation , other than to repeat that both the @entity81 and @entity177 will be cooperating fully			0
' we will continue to work with all of the game 's stakeholders to address the important issues of respect and discriminatory behaviour in all its forms			0
