by @entity0 @entity3 centre @entity1 hit the post with a late conversion attempt as the @entity3 were narrowly beaten 20 - 18 by @entity6 in a thriller on the new synthetic pitch at @entity9			1
@entity1 was just unable to snatch a draw for the battling home side , who were ultimately sunk by a controversial @entity13 try midway through the second half			2
a break up the left touchline saw back rower @entity16 feed the ball inside for @entity13 to score to a cacophony of boos from the crowd as it looked a forward pass			0
@entity3 's @entity1 reacts after missing a key conversion attempt in their loss to @entity6 @entity1 hit the post as he missed a late conversion from out wide that could have snatched a draw referee @entity29 gave the score but then halted @entity31 as he was lining up the conversion to see a replay on the big screen and eventually decided the try was good			1
@entity36 , who ran the game , kicked the extras and at 20 - 10 @entity6 looked virtually home and dry , although a late penalty from @entity41 followed by a try from @entity43 - from which @entity1 hit the post with his conversion - had the crowd on the edge of their seats			1
it meant a losing bonus point for @entity3 , but the @entity3 side have now gone 18 @entity54 games without a win - their last victory in the league coming against @entity6 last october			2
although it was close in the end , @entity6 deserved their win			0
they had the edge at the set piece , especially the scrummage , and were far superior behind against a @entity3 side lacking any sort of cutting edge - two of @entity3 ’s tries coming from line - out catch and drives			0
referee @entity29 asks for a tv reply from the ground before awarding @entity3 's second try @entity73 carries the ball in the move that led to the @entity3 ' first try against @entity6 @entity3 were 6 - 5 down at half - time to two @entity36 penalties while @entity80 ’s penalty into the corner set up the line - out drive for @entity84 cap @entity73 to score on his home debut in the 10th minute			1
@entity1 missed the conversion and @entity6 dominated much of the remainder of the half with @entity36 kicking a penalty after @entity90 intercepted and was then caught and pinged for holding on , before the former @entity92 international landed a 45 - metre shot in first - half stoppage - time			2
@entity36 was also the spark for @entity6 ’s first try , his weaving run linking up with @entity95 and @entity96 had an easy run - in in the 45th minute			0
@entity3 run out onto their new artificial pitch at @entity9 before narrowly losing to @entity6 the clash with @entity6 was the first @entity54 match on the new surface @entity36 ’s conversion put @entity107 13 - 5 up and when @entity106 was sin binned for a dangerous tackle on @entity109 , @entity1 missed another sitter when @entity3 badly needed three points			1
@entity3 then spurned another kick at goal to go for the corner and they were back in the game when @entity116 was driven over for the try to make it 13 - 10			0
then came that controversial @entity13 try converted by @entity36 in then 65th minute which should have put the game beyond @entity3 ’s reach			0
but @entity1 ’s 70th - minute penalty gave @entity3 a glimmer of hope which @entity43 fanned into a flame when he crashed over in the corner in stoppage time to make it 20 - 18 , although they could not snatch the draw as @entity130 ’s conversion attempt from wide out hit the post .			1

@entity1 could have *salvaged* a draw with a late conversion
the attempt hit the post to see the @entity3 fall to an *agonising* *defeat*
@entity73 , @entity116 and @entity43 *crossed* for the @entity3
@entity6 's @entity13 scored a controversial second - half try
it added to @entity96 's first - half five - pointer
the match was the first @entity54 game on @entity3 's new artificial pitch
