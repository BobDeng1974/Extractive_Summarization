there was late drama at the @entity2 as @entity3 struck deep in injury - time to extend @entity5 ' unbeaten run at @entity6			1
@entity7 looked to have won it for @entity6 with seven minutes remaining when he finally found a way to beat @entity5 ' brilliant goalkeeper @entity10			1
but then @entity3 was on hand to power in a controversial equaliser when @entity14 was left floored on the ground when he went up for a cross in to his area			2
@entity3 holds his arms aloft and celebrates his 95th - minute equaliser for @entity5 @entity7 ( second left ) scores for @entity6 with a strike from just inside the area referee @entity23 was booed off at the final whistle by the home fans and @entity6 manager @entity26 was sent to the stands after his complaints			1
but @entity5 returned to @entity29 with a point to prevent @entity6 from climbing into the top two			1
@entity6 , who slipped down to fourth before kick - off because of @entity35 's win at @entity36 , knew that they would have to stop one of the @entity39 's other form teams if they were to stand any chance of climbing in to the top two			1
rovers , unbeaten in their previous eight matches , had to make two changes to the side which defeated @entity46			0
the most notable was @entity10 's first start in goal since january because @entity50 , on loan from @entity6 , was ineligible to face his parent club			2
@entity52 sports a red bandage after a clash of heads during the draw at the @entity2 former @entity6 favourite @entity57 was presented to the crowd before the match at the @entity2 and he was soon called into action when he had to race out of his area to head clear a dangerous long ball			1
while the danger soon disappeared that time , he had to make a strong save to his right shortly after when @entity65 drove powerfully at goal following a probing @entity68 run			0
after consecutive draws , @entity6 were looking to return to winning ways and started brightly			0
they were unfortunate not to have a half - time lead and @entity71 thought he had delivered exactly that			0
when @entity7 's curling effort from 20 yards was spilled by @entity10 in the six - yard box , @entity71 pounced to lift the rebound up over the keeper but as the ball headed for the line it was hooked clear by @entity79			2
winger @entity80 then shot narrowly wide of the upright			0
@entity5 struggled to get out of their own half and @entity6 passed the ball around the green shirts confidently , with @entity26 's men regularly creating chances but failing to convert so the visitors remained in contention for something			2
@entity3 ( third right ) had a header earlier in the match saved such was @entity6 's dominance in the first half , it was hard to believe that @entity5 were still level after the home side had mustered up an impressive 12 shots in the opening period alone			1
@entity5 boss @entity99 needed to find a way of getting his forwards more involved after the restart , with neither @entity103 nor @entity3 touching the ball anywhere near as much he would have liked			2
but the second half continued in the same way , with @entity5 happy to allow @entity6 to have possession and look for a counter-attack - and the ploy almost worked			1
seconds after @entity10 had denied @entity7 at one end , @entity5 broke down the other end and @entity14 was forced to make his first real save when he dived to his left to parry @entity113 's well - driven effort			1
@entity114 official @entity23 refereed the game at the @entity2 the best save of the lot , though , belonged to @entity10			0
the @entity2 was left stunned when he somehow scurried across his line , dived left to turn behind a free header from @entity71 which was destined for the net following a lovely @entity122 delivery			0
there was also a save to deny @entity125 's back post volley and then from @entity68 but , finally , @entity6 got the break they needed			0
a failure to deal with a corner saw a half clearance drop invitingly for @entity7 to power towards goal			0
it was helped on its way by a deflection , and @entity10 was finally beaten			0
@entity5 , however , battled back and @entity3 - sporting a nasty bump on his head after an earlier clash - hit the equaliser when @entity14 did not deal with the ball in to his box late on .			1

on - loan @entity142 *midfielder* @entity7 scored for @entity6
his 83rd - minute strike could have sent @entity6 *joint* - top of the table
but @entity3 netted in the 95th minute for @entity5
both sides stay in play - off places after draw at the @entity2
