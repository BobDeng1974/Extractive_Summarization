' every time i think about one , i just smile from ear to ear , man			0
it 's just a great feeling			2
when we 're down there , you make eyes with @entity14 , you know he 's about to throw it			2
' after struggling in his first two games running new offensive coordinator @entity71 's @entity73 playbook , @entity14 has led the @entity19 ( 2 - 2 ) to consecutive victories			1
