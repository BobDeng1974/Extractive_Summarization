countless teens , both boys and girls , have been sharing the disturbing results of their experiments on @entity71 and @entity72 , which in many cases has led to severe bruising around the mouth			2
surprisingly , given the sheer number of teens attempting the feat , it appears the results are far from desirable			2

it was very , very painful			0
' one boy expertly demonstrates just how extreme the effects can be if you try hard enough sore - looking red marks are visible around the lip line of this dejected experimenter as for @entity23 herself , the 17 - year - old @entity191 clan member has recently denied artificially enhancing her lips , despite much speculation to the contrary			1
