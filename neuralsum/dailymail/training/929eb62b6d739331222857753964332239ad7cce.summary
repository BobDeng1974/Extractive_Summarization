mr @entity8 was fed up meeting women in the usual places and wanted to try something new			1
‘ i knew i needed to meet some people			2
most of the time i was meeting partners through work which is obviously not ideal , and i do n’t really do the whole nightlife thing anymore			0
' ‘ i also get a bad impression from dating sites and @entity38			2
it ’s so time consuming , and i do n’t think rejecting people to that degree is really very healthy			0
' when asked if his page was not going to involve a likewise process of rejection , he replied ‘ not at all			2
this is going to have some proper interaction , rather than just mindlessly swiping away			0
’ ‘ plus , this way i get to be the centre of the operation , rather than just being one in the thousands online			0
’ mr @entity8 runs his own personal training business in @entity1			1
he says that finding romance through work is ' not ideal ' mr @entity8 says he has already found some possible romantic matches , and he plans to set some dates in the next week mr @entity8 says his friends have been very supportive , with scores of them sharing the page and tagging potential partners			1
and he ’s already found prospective matches			1
‘ i 've already had some promising contacts who i plan to meet with			0
i 'll be setting a time and seeing who is available on the day , then using the advice of some close friends to narrow down the process after the date			0
’ when asked if he was concerned the criticism @entity70 from the @entity4 received for embarking on a comparable venture , he said ‘ there are parallels , but ultimately i think those bachelor guys act pretty ingenuine			0
if you ’re straightforward and act with authenticity , i think you ca n’t go wrong			0
