by @entity0 the @entity2 will tour @entity3 in an old @entity4 during her state visit next week because none of @entity8 's citroens have the space to fit her large hats , it has been reported			1
the @entity3 president has personally invited her majesty to @entity13 to help him commemorate the 70th anniversary of the d - day landings on june 6			1
but heads have been spinning at the @entity17 ever since the announcement after staff realised she would not be able to sit upright in either the pokey presidential @entity20 or the larger @entity23 model if she wears any one of her large hats			1
many hats : the @entity3 president has personally invited her majesty to @entity13 to help him commemorate the 70th anniversary of the d - day landings on june 6 head spin : but heads have been spinning at the @entity17 ever since the announcement after staff realised she would not be able to sit upright in the pokey presidential @entity20 if she wears any one of her many hats old friends : @entity2 last met president @entity8 in 2012 when he paid a visit to @entity33 their first option was a @entity37 limousine , rolled out primarily for dignitaries on ceremonial occasions , but its low roof line would not have accommodated @entity2 's lavish headgear , the @entity34 reported			1
then there was the @entity20 , but that , they found , had the same problem			0
their only other choice was one of the large people carriers used to ferry @entity17 staff and security , but that was quickly dismissed , deemed unfit for royalty , said the newspaper			0
so after much toing and froing , @entity8 decided it best to wheel out his old @entity57 , which - at 62.2 inches - stands 2.6 inches taller than the ' compact executive ' @entity20			1
however , the expensive @entity57 was a commercial failure for @entity4 a decade ago and production was halted in 2009 after seven years			0
the model provided for the @entity2 is an armoured 3.5 - litre @entity62			2
tall car : after much toing and froing , @entity8 decided it best to wheel out his old @entity57 ( pictured ) , which - at 62.2 inches - stands 2.6 inches taller than the ' compact executive ' @entity20 too small : staff at @entity17 's first option was a @entity37 limousine , used primarily on ceremonial occasions , but its low roof line would not have accommodated @entity2 's lavish headgear either president @entity8 first rode out in his new @entity20 for his inauguration in 2012 in which he got drenched on an embarrassing open - topped drive up the @entity17			1
he chose the @entity20 in display of modesty as he attempted to contrast himself from predecessor @entity81 's lavish image			0
on their visit , beginning next thursday , the @entity2 and @entity82 , who will be aged 88 and 92 respectively at the time , will undertake a series of engagements to mark the @entity87 war effort before travelling on to @entity88 where they will be formally received by president @entity8 at the @entity17			2
it is her first visit to @entity3 since she made the same trip to meet president @entity93 ten years ago			0
long time coming : the last time the @entity2 visited @entity3 was in 2004 with then - president @entity93 after friday ’s ceremonies by the @entity13 beaches , with the @entity97 and much of the senior royal family , the @entity2 will return to a state banquet at the @entity17			2
she will be presented with an album of photographs from her first two @entity3 visits , an official trip in 1948 as princess @entity2 and a state visit with the @entity82 nine years later			2
@entity8 is so keen to impress ' @entity105 ' , as she is always known , that he has ordered fois gras to be at the top of the menu because he knows it is a royal favourite , claimed @entity34			0
the royal couple will then tuck in to a main course of lamb with small vegetables and a @entity114 wine , followed by a cheese platter of reblochon , a pungent specialty of the @entity119 region of @entity3 .			0

the @entity2 is visiting @entity3 to commemorate 70th anniversary of d - day
but @entity8 's @entity20 has not got the space to fit her large hats
so @entity3 president orders out @entity57 , which is 2.6ins taller
