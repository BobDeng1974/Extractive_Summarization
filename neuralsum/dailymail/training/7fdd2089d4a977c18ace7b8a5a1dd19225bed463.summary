here , @entity8 's @entity7 gives his verdict on the performances of both sets of players			0
@entity5 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) @entity14 - made everything look ridiculously easy including a near - post save from @entity15			1
7 @entity16 had an opportunity to score in the first couple of minutes but put his shot inches wide @entity20 - plenty of energy as a right wing - back but not always the highest quality			1
6.5 @entity6 - excellent reading of the game			1
his wasted season at @entity0 is a mystery and after being foiled by @entity29 , he broke their hearts with a late , late strike			1
7.5 @entity32 - did n't take any prisoners , appearing to knee @entity34 in the back at one stage			2
6.5 @entity37 - dangerous on the left - hand side , with fantastic delivery from wide areas			0
7.5 @entity41 played well for @entity0 and set the tone in the centre of the park @entity45 - the man is a machine			1
nothing spectacular but always a leader			0
6.5 @entity50 - seems to have got over his @entity52 loss of form			0
6.5 @entity55 - his pace and movement caused @entity0 problems			1
7 @entity16 - excellent movement but left his prolific @entity52 scoring form at home			1
6.5 @entity64 - looks ungainly but he gave the @entity5 attack a focal point			2

7 @entity71 @entity72 76 ( for @entity16 ) 5.5 - the best and worst , great dribble followed by @entity75 dive as @entity41 came across to challenge @entity77 84 ( for @entity20 ) , @entity78 ( for @entity79 85 ) @entity80 - got it right tactically , though the win was late in coming			1
7.5 @entity64 has endured a slower than expected start at @entity5 since his summer move @entity0 ( 4 - 5 - 1 ) @entity29 - back to his best with a string of saves particularly from @entity16 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity6			1
he did n't deserve to end up on the losing side			0
9 @entity90 - given the nod at right - back and survived early penalty shout on @entity16			2
6.5 @entity94 - the sort of dogfight he loved			0
a great battle with @entity64			0
7 @entity98 - no reason for @entity100 to use Â£ 32m @entity101 with @entity102 steady			0
6.5 @entity103 and no surprise when he was booked for foul on @entity20			0
6 @entity107 enjoyed a rare start as @entity100 opted to begin the match with a five - man midfield @entity111 of game seemed to pass him by			2
5.5 @entity41 - could n't stem @entity5 fully and relieved his handball was judged accidental			1
6 @entity116 - rested at weekend to recover from @entity118 duty			0
5.5 @entity107 - his blistering pace was a good outlet			0
one sprint and cross set up @entity34			0

set up @entity15 with a pass of beauty & nearly headed a winner			0
7.5 @entity15 - tried manfully in lone striker 's role and took the hits , but blew his goal chance			2
6 @entity71 @entity113 58 ( for @entity68 ) 6 - the discipline you 'd expect from @entity113 in a central midfield role @entity138 74 ( for @entity15 ) 5.5 - @entity0 on the backfoot by the time he came on @entity141 87 ( for @entity142 ) @entity100 - outplayed but can claim his tough love to @entity29 has worked			1
6.5 referee @entity145 - did well to control a full - blooded match			0
6.5 in - form @entity147 forward @entity15 was preferred up front to @entity138 for @entity0			2
