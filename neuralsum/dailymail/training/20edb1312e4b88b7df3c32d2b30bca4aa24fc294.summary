by @entity0 psychopaths are defined as ruthless people who suffer from a chronic mental disorder that can manifest in abnormal or violent social behaviour			1
but one diagnosed psychopath says they 're not all violent murderers - they could even be your boss			1
she believes people who have the condition like she does are more likely to get ahead in life			2
thanks to her manipulative streak , combined with a lack of empathy for others and excessive self - esteem , she 's become a high - flying attorney earning £ 150,000 a year			1
the woman , who is in her thirties , has written a book about herself , called @entity24 of a @entity25 : @entity26 , under the pen name @entity28			2
secret psychopath : a high - flying lawyer , known as miss @entity28 , said having the mental condition has not held her back in life she will also appear , without being identified , on a @entity34 show this saturday - @entity25 night - that will try to unravel the mystery of this minority , with the help of leading experts			1
the programme reveals some familiar faces who are high on the psychopathic scale , including a star of the @entity46 football team			0
doctors on the show found miss @entity28 displays many psychopathic traits such as egocentrism , interpersonal dominace , verbal aggression and excessive self - esteem			1
she said : ' i think i always knew that i was n't quite like other people			2
i 've always known that my heart is a little blacker and colder than most people 's			1
during college i recognised that i was a very manipulative cunning person who was unable to connect to anyone on more than a superficial level			2
' diagnosis : psychologist dr @entity63 describes miss @entity28 as a ' successful psychopath ' miss @entity28 admits she has an ' obsession with power and willing to do anything to get ahead ' but unlike some psychopaths ( many are responsible for about half of serious crimes committed ) , she 's not a murderer or a criminal			1
in fact she said : ' you would like me if you met me , i am quite confident about that because i have met a statistically sample size of the population and they were all susceptible to my charms			0
' she said she prefers to call herself a ' sociopath ' because of the negative connotations of psycho in the popular culture ( fuelled by fictional characters like @entity86 and real life psychopaths such as @entity88 )			2
she admitted : ' sometimes it feels that i am in the movie @entity91 and any slip up or indication that i am different will draw suspicion			0
i do feel a little bit like a misunderstood minority , the only thing that you can sort of hope if you 're a sociopath is that you are going to lie well enough and wear the mask well enough and hide in plain sight such that nobody will find out that you 're a sociopath			0
' she added : ' i may have a disorder , but i am not crazy			0
' dr @entity63 , a psychology professor from @entity104 diagnosed miss @entity28 can be described as a ' socialised ' or ' successful ' psychopath because of her academic and profession achievements			1
he said : ' her presentation in many regards could be considered that of a prototypical psychopathic personality ... such as a pronounced lack of empathy , a ruthless and calculating attitude towards social and interpersonal relationships , and a relative immunity to experiencing negative emotions			0
' most notable in ms. @entity28 's clinical presentation … were pronounced elevations on scales tapping antisocial and psychopathic traits ( particularly egocentricism and sensation - seeking characteristics ) , interpersonal dominance , verbal aggression , and excessive self - esteem , as well as very low scores on measures tapping negative affective experiences ( e.g. , phobias ) ' secret of success : miss @entity28 said psychopaths make good bosses because of their ruthlessness and lack of empathy ( posed by models ) he added : ' although cognizant that she is " different " from most people she knows in terms of her personality structure , ms. @entity28 does not view herself as " disordered " in the sense of suffering from a form of mental illness per se			1
quite the contrary , she seems content with her lifestyle and its current trajectory and rather blasé about many issues and concerns that might cause others some degree of uncertainty or distress			0
of course , such attitudes are emblematic of individuals who are highly psychopathic			0
' by all accounts ms. @entity28 has thus far experienced relatively few objective ( or subjective ) negative consequences associated with being highly psychopathic - and in many regards appears to have excelled across various life domains ( e.g. , academic , occupational )			1
this suggests that one might describe her as a " socialized " or " successful " psychopath			0
' miss @entity28 believes there are many other secret psychopaths like her and that they are ' the grease making the world go round '			1
she added : ' people sometimes say that we lack remorse or guilt like it 's a bad thing			2
they are sure that remorse and guilt are necessary to being a " good " person			0
but there is probably no universal , and certainly no objective , morality			0
' @entity175 will be on @entity34 on saturday 14 december at 9pm			0
