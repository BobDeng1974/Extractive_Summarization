romance is in the air for @entity2 this week			1
if there ’s one @entity7 last - 16 clash that tugs at the heartstrings then it ’s @entity10 ’s clash against @entity11			1
@entity2 will , for the first time , go head to head with the club he left in 1994 after seven years — in which time he won a @entity16 title and a @entity17			1
however , the @entity19 boss , whose side improved their top - four hopes with victory over @entity23 on saturday , is lukewarm about the reunion			1
@entity2 insists he has n't thought about the reunion with his former side @entity11 this week @entity2 pictured as @entity11 manager all the way back in 1987 ‘ have i thought about @entity11 ? not at all — i have enough experience to know that the most important game is the next one , ’ said the @entity29			1
‘ honestly , i have n’t			2
what has been important for me has been to win at @entity23			2
@entity34 has scored more penalties ( six ) in the @entity36 this season than any player			2
‘ we have fought like mad to come back in a strong position in the league			0
not to win at @entity23 would have been disastrous			0
’ perhaps @entity2 will show more emotion when he returns to the principality ahead of the second leg on march 17			1
the prospect of a place in the @entity7 quarter - finals is likely to warm the manager ’s heart , too			1
@entity10 have crashed out at the last - 16 stage in the past four seasons , twice against @entity52 , once against @entity53 and once against @entity54			1
the clash against @entity11 , on paper , seems much more winnable			1
but the @entity10 manager is refusing to count his chickens			2
@entity59 was proud of his @entity23 side for their efforts against @entity10 ‘ the last 16 in recent years has been super-tough , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ but this is a 50 - 50 game			0
@entity11 are very tight defensively and they conceded once in the group stage			2
it is two good teams			0
so for us , it ’s a tricky but a possible tie			0
‘ it really is a 50 - 50			0
they have followed a similar pattern to us			0
they have come back in their championship , so their confidence will be high			0
’ palace manager @entity59 says his players should take huge confidence from pushing the @entity19 all the way on saturday			0
going in 2 - 0 down at half - time following goals from @entity34 and @entity80 , @entity23 went within inches of securing a point after @entity83 scored in stoppage time before hitting the post in the final attack of the game			2
@entity83 ( far right ) netted in stoppage time to give @entity23 hope against @entity10 @entity59 said : ‘ i think we should have a little more confidence in what we have in the dressing room , and i think they showed that against @entity10			1
they believed it against @entity10 for the first time since i ’ve been here			1
‘ we ’ve won games because we ’ve been resilient and we do have attacking flair on the break			0
' but we can also mix it and take it to the opposition , and i was very proud of the team today that they believed they could do it , and they almost achieved it			0
‘ i ’m pleased that they believe they can take a game to the likes of @entity10 because we ’ve got some big clubs to come here still — @entity116 and @entity117			2
‘ and we can mix it with them and we ’ve got to believe that			0
of course the next three games are in and around that mid-table and we ’ve got to exploit that situation			0

@entity10 face @entity11 in the last 16 of the @entity7 this week
@entity2 faces his old side for the first time in *21* years
however , he insists he has n't thought much about the reunion
