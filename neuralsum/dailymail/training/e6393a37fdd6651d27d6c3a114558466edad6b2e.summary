the company says it is facing a flood of false claims relating to the spill , and commentators have said it may have to pay out so much compensation it could be taken over by a competitor			0
reports even suggested that the firm had appealed directly to the prime minister , asking him to raise the issue with the @entity20 government in an attempt to limit @entity1 's losses			1
however , @entity24 officials today insisted that mr @entity3 had not been approached by @entity1 , adding that the firm 's troubles did not come up at a recent meeting with @entity28			1
@entity29 : reports have claimed that @entity1 is seeking the help of @entity3 to avoid a slew of compensation claims @entity1 has sought an injunction to stop payouts to companies which are allegedly claiming fraudulent or inflated losses from its $ 8.2billion ( £ 5.4billion ) pot of compensation for the disaster			1
an appeal document recently filed by @entity1 in the @entity20 courts claims that businesses from the @entity44 have been handed millions of dollars for ' non-existent , artificially calculated losses '			2
the blow - out of the @entity47 well off the @entity49 coast in 2010 claimed 11 lives and damaged fishing and tourism industries as well as marine and wildlife habitats , forcing @entity1 to agree a multi-billion - dollar compensation deal in april 2012			1

' in its first - quarter results published last month , @entity1 warned that compensation may be ' significantly higher ' than the $ 8.2billion it has set aside , because it had underestimated the number of claims it would receive			2
@entity1 also emphasised that the compensation settlement is ' uncapped except for economic loss claims related to the @entity7 seafood industry '			2
appeal : but mr @entity3 did not raise the issue of @entity1 's troubles during his recent meeting with @entity3 the complaint centres on the claim that businesses are allowed to compare earnings before and after the spill in ways which appear to inflate their losses			2
