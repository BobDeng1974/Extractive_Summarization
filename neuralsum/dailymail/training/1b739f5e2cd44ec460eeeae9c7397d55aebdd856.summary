by @entity1 reporter president @entity3 is descended from @entity5 's first black slave on his white mother 's side , genealogists have claimed			1
dna analysis and marriage and property records have suggested that @entity3 is the 11th great - grandchild of @entity11 , the first black slave living in colonial @entity12 nearly four centuries ago			1
while it was known that @entity3 's mother , @entity16 , had @entity18 ancestors , researchers discovered she also had at least this one @entity20 forebear			2
the discovery sheds further light on the @entity20 biography of @entity3 , who last year released his birth certificate to prove he was born in the country and not @entity27 , from where his black father hails			2
discovery : @entity30 has found @entity3 is descended from @entity5 's first black slave on the side of his mother , @entity16 , pictured with @entity3 as a child			1
he is the slave 's 11th great grandson the team from @entity30 said they lacked definitive proof , but that evidence ' strongly suggests ' the tie , which two independent genealogists told the @entity40 was ' sound '			1
@entity11 's story stretches back to the mid- 1600s ; he was working as a servant when he escaped @entity12 for @entity43 in 1640 , the @entity40 reported			2
once there , he was captured and put on trial with two white servants who had also escaped , but he received the severest punishment and was condemned to servitude for life			2
the sentence , which came years before @entity12 set laws condoning slavery , has led historians to regard him as @entity5 's first legally sanctioned slave			0
family tree : the chart shows the line from @entity58 to @entity3			2
the name changed to ' @entity60 ' after @entity58 had children with a white woman , who passed on her free status to them and changed their name @entity67 professor @entity66 said that historians are unable to pinpoint an exact date the slave trade began , but servants were bought and sold in the region from 1617			1
without the specific date , historians deem punch to be one of the first certain slaves , he added			0
over two years , @entity30 used marriage and property records to trace @entity3 's mother 's ancestors back to the time and place where @entity11 lived			1
records also showed he fathered children with a white woman , who passed on her free status to them and gave them a slightly different name - bunch			1
this name is in @entity16 's family tree			0
as the @entity60 married , they became prominent landowners in @entity12 and were known as white , according to @entity30			1
the team traced two @entity93 family branches - one that stayed in @entity12 and one that moved to the @entity94			1
in @entity12 , they were known as white , in @entity97 they were recorded as ' mulatto '			0
home : a map of early @entity12 drawn between 1677 and 1793 shows where the first bunches owned land ' proof ' : @entity104 , a land grant for @entity106 in 1662 shows he was at least 21 , making him the right age to be father of @entity109 , a 1827 transcript of 1640 @entity11 court record enslaving him for life descendants of this mulatto family - another term for mixed race - are the president 's cousins , records show			1
but @entity3 descends directly from the @entity12 family , which moved to @entity121			0
his great - great - great - great - grandmother was born there , and her daughter moved to @entity125 , where his mother was born in 1942			1
' we sort of stumbled across it , ' lead researcher @entity127 told the @entity40			0
' we were just doing general research into the president â€™s family tree , and as we started digging back in time , we realised that the @entity93 family were @entity20			2
' despite the discovery , investigators ca n't be 100 per cent sure of the connection as many records have been destroyed			0
but the similarities of the surnames , dna evidence showing today 's bunches have @entity143 heritage and the fact that only a few @entity145 lived in @entity12 in the 1600s confirmed the connection			1
descendants : @entity3 is pictured with his mother , her father @entity149 and his half - sister @entity150 in the early 1970s family : @entity3 is pictured with his step - father @entity153 , his half sister and his mother in the 1960s future president : @entity3 is pictured in the 1960s with his father , @entity159 , who was from @entity27 ' the odds , based on what does actually survive , strongly suggest that president @entity3 is a descendant ( he would be the 11th great - grandson ) of the first enslaved @entity143 in @entity5 , ' @entity163 and her team wrote in their research paper			1
two independent genealogists agreed that the research was ' sound ' and ' safe ' , adding that the difference of the @entity170 and @entity93 were ' meaningless '			0
@entity60 descendants also provided a @entity173 swab to help with the project , and researchers found the dna profile was common in @entity177			1
' i consider myself @entity181 , but i find that my mixed - race roots go way back , ' @entity93 , who lives in @entity178 , @entity179 , told the @entity40			2
while the mixed - race heritage of a woman deemed @entity181 may seem odd , the @entity40 added that more and more @entity5 are discovering they too have ancestors from a different race			0
before the slave trade : @entity3 's ancestor @entity11 was condemned to a life of slavery in 1640 for escaping a home where he worked as a servant			1
the sentence made him @entity5 's first slave ( file picture ) ' it is becoming increasingly common now because people are discovering it , ' said @entity199 , a former president of the @entity200 , adding the internet has helped			0
' in the past , very few records were available			0
very few people made the effort to do the research			0
' president @entity3 , 50 , was born in @entity206 in 1961 soon after his father , from @entity27 , and mother split			0
last year , he released his long form birth certificate to silence the ' birther ' row and prove he was born in @entity206 and not @entity27 , making him eligible to be the @entity5 president			0
his father , @entity159 , went to @entity212 after his birth then returned to @entity27 where he remarried before he passed away in 1982			0
the president 's mother , @entity16 , died in 1995 .			0

@entity30 carried out two - year project into mother 's heritage
property and marriage records suggested his mother was descended from @entity11 , who was condemned to life of slavery in 1640
he had children with white woman who passed on her free status to them and changed their name to ' @entity60 '
dna taken from today 's white @entity93 family suggests @entity177 roots
makes @entity3 11th great - grandchild of punch
