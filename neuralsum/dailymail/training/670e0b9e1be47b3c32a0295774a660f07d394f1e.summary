a man who has been left with a scalp riddled with more than 50 dent - like scars after hair - loss surgery went horribly wrong has decided to go under the knife again in a bid to fix it			1
@entity6 , 51 , was left with a cluster of deep scars across the top of his head following an attempted hair transplant , and electrolysis in an attempt to fix it			1
the electrical project manager , from @entity16 , faced many men 's worst nightmare when he lost his hair at a young age			2
' at the time i suppose it affected me quite deeply and i was borderline desperation			0
' after research , @entity6 decided to pursue his dream of a full head of hair and booked in for a hair transplant			1
' initially the transplant seemed to work and offered a solution , ' he said			2
' however as my natural hair started to receded more it exposed the transplanted area , which grew in a very tufty sort of fashion , which obviously looked unsightly			0
' it looked like a toothbrush			0
it got the point where the results of the surgery looked worse than having no surgery at all			0
' @entity6 has decided to have one last attempt at correcting the effects of the initial surgery @entity6 says that the effects of his disastrous surgeries are worse than being bald after his initial disastrous procedure , a desperate @entity6 tried electrolysis to remove the abnormal hair growth			1
however , while this did remove the tufts of hair , it has left @entity6 with about 50 indented scars on the top of his head			1
' on a daily basis when you look in the mirror it 's something that you ca n't avoid seeing because it 's in your face			0
it challenges me and it does make me feel low			0
' @entity6 's partner @entity83 is aware of the deep psychological effect the scars have on @entity6 , saying : ' i know it is always in the back of his mind			1
it 's something that bothers him quite a bit			0
' dr @entity92 's series of surgeries aim to remove the deep scars and stitch them over although the procedure can not remove the scars completely , they are markedly less deep and @entity6 hopes that further operations will improve their appearance even further deeply unhappy with his appearance , @entity6 has decided to have one last attempt at correcting the effects of the initial surgery , visiting specialist hair surgeon dr @entity104			1
dr @entity104 suggests a series of surgery that remove the deep scars and stitch them over			2
but the severity of his scarring means that @entity6 is warned he will never totally be able to remove the puck - like dimples in his scalp , and that improving them will take numerous surgeries over a two year period			1
however , @entity6 's outlook is far more positive after the first surgery			2
' obviously there is still some indentation , but it 's less noticeable			0
i want to carry on with the surgeries and try to improve it			0
' see @entity6 's full story on @entity37 , tonight at 10pm on @entity38			2
