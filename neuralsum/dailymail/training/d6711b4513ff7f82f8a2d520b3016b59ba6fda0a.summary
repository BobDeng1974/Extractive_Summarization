by @entity0 every time i see a picture of @entity5 , it gladdens my heart			1
there she is at a premiere , surrounded by women half her age and with twice as many stylists , and she looks better than the lot of them			1
better than @entity15 ( too thin ) , better than @entity16 ( too vanilla ) , better than @entity18 or @entity19 , women who make a living out of being beautiful			1
what makes @entity5 so standout special is that she has an honest kind of beauty			1
she ’s not trying too hard ( @entity25 ) , she ’s sexy without being porny ( @entity26 ) , she does n’t have any weird affectations , such as @entity29 ’s pout or @entity31 ’s fringe , and her smile always seems to reach her eyes			1
most notably , though , at 68 she is an example of how a mature woman can continue to turn heads long after her official sell - by date			1
if anything , she looks better now that she did in her theoretical prime			1
@entity0 gives you her top tips on how to make your beauty regime turn you into @entity5 and that ’s because , contrary to what the magazines and ad agencies would have you believe , attractiveness has little to do with perfection			1
all those hard - bodied , no - dairy , no - wheat , no meat , no - fun , fitness fascists are n’t beautiful , they ’re just annoying — and extremely hungry			1
beauty is not about flawless skin or the perfect flat stomach			1
it ’s holistic : a combination of style , confidence , personality , diet , decent genes , a good hairdresser and , of course , products			1
products are always a bit controversial for the older woman			1
most women @entity5 ’s age , including my mother , think that my generation waste far too much money on lotions , potions and treatments			1
it ’s because they ’re war babies ; a pot of @entity77 ’s is pushing the boat out for them			1
even if my mother could have afforded @entity80 , she would n’t have bought it on principle			1
she was the kind of person who melted down her old lipsticks			1
so , with the ghost of all our mothers looking disapprovingly over their reading specs , i have chosen carefully when selecting my ultimate products for women over 50			1
look no further ladies , this is all you need : first is an all - time favourite of mine , @entity97 ’s @entity96 : ( £ 40 ) 100 per cent natural , a blend of rosehip , argan , neroli and vitamin @entity103 it is nectar for older , dehydrated skins , and it smells like nectar , too			1
it ’s best used at night , last thing before bed after a nice hot bath or shower			1
warm a few drops between the palms of your hands , inhale the soothing scent and press it gently into your skin			1
@entity118 ( £ 12.92 ) is also one for mature ladies to watch out for			1
a powerful antioxidant that is naturally present in the body , it plays a key role in cell regeneration			1
i have a theory about wrinkles : horizontal lines , good ; vertical lines , bad			1
horizontal lines come from laughing and squinting at the sun. vertical lines , the ones you get between your eyes and around the mouth , give you what ’s known as ‘ bitchy resting face ’ ( that ’s a technical term )			1
what makes @entity5 so standout special is that she has an honest kind of beauty and so onto my next product , @entity144 ’s @entity143 ( £ 31 , @entity145 )			1
it contains the highest non-prescription levels of pure retinol , which is clinically proven to soften so - called ‘ dynamic ’ wrinkles ( those generated by repeated muscle movement rather than ageing )			1
unlike most retinoids , this one is moisturising and suitable even for sensitive skins			1
every older woman should also pick up no 7 ’s @entity157 ( £ 24.99 ) , which is specifically designed for the over- 60s			1
it aims to treat lines , lack of firmness , uneven pigmentation , fragility and dullness , and the ingredients are clinically proven			1
and a cracking new all - rounder is @entity169 ’s @entity168 ( £ 48 )			1
they ’ve thrown the kitchen sink at this one , with ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and beech tree extract , and the result is a highly effective , comforting treatment that improves the feel and look of older skins			2
aside from the face , the one area that you need to keep an eye on as the years roll by is the decolletage			2
nothing is more annoying than a wrinkly cleavage			2
uv rays are the real culprit , so dr @entity189 and @entity190 ( £ 19.90 , @entity145 ) is ideal because it contains an @entity191 of 15 as well as tried and tested ingredients to improve skin elasticity and hydration			2
make - up wise , less is always more when you are over 50			1
you want light , translucent products that glide on and do n’t get absorbed by thirsty skin			1
@entity200 ’s @entity199 ( £ 39 ) combines effective coverage with a gossamer - like texture			2
you should also brighten and freshen up the eye area with a good illuminator : @entity206 ’s @entity205 ( £ 30.50 ) would be my choice			2
it ’s a wonder product			2
@entity206 would also be my suggestion for a bronzer — it ’s one of the few cosmetics where you really do get what you pay for			2
the @entity218 @entity217 palette ( £ 47 ) works all year round to add just a bit of pizzazz to dull skin			2
keep eyeshadow simple and clean : use soft golden pinks to flatter skin tone , and blend and blur as much as you can for a nice soft finish			2
@entity229 ’s @entity228 and define pencils ( £ 8 ) are perfect , and they come in a good choice of neutral shades			2
for lips , avoid highly pigmented lipsticks : they can look very harsh and unforgiving			2
add a bit of @entity236 ( £ 2.18 ) to your favourite lipstick for a fresher look and invest in @entity241 ’s colourless lip liner ( £ 18 ) , which will stop colour bleeding			2
lastly , if you dye your grey hair , get down to @entity244 for colourist - to - the - stars @entity247 ’s innovative @entity246 ( £ 12.50 )			2
it ’s indispensable between visits to the hairdresser			2
it ’s foundation for hair : you paint on the colour and those pesky roots vanish in a flash			2
@entity258 's @entity257 @entity258 ’s @entity257 ( £ 78.50 , @entity259 )			0
it ’s gorgeous , warm and glamorous without being overpowering			0
a soft , seductive woody floral , first formulated in 1936			0
order a sample for £ 3.50 from @entity268 ( 020 7730 2322 )			0
@entity269 ( from £ 110 )			0
created in 1927 by @entity270 following an encounter with a dashing @entity272			0
@entity273 , daring and dangerous			0
@entity274 ( from £ 95 , @entity275 , as above )			0
like falling head first into a spring bouquet			0
@entity278 ( from £ 60 , @entity279 )			0
@entity280 , fresh citrus with a cypress base			0
a lovely , go - anywhere scent			0
actresses @entity285 , 63 , and @entity286 , 69 , have voiced their disapproval of @entity288 , saying they would never consider it as a way of staving off old age			0
‘ as an actress , this is my canvas , ’ says @entity292			0
‘ i stay away from @entity288 and all these things because i need my wrinkles			0
anyway , a few years ago i would have been in complete agreement with them			0
until very recently , pretty much anyone who had @entity288 just ended up really weird and shiny			0
parts of @entity302 , @entity303 and @entity304 were starting to look like that episode of @entity306 when the mannequins come to life and try to take over the world			0
then came the killer blow : @entity311 had it live on telly			0
thing is , @entity288 — used correctly and judiciously — is actually rather brilliant			0
the effects can be subtle , but extremely effective			0
@entity317 used to have botox treatments in the past the real issue is that though @entity288 is a prescription drug , anyone can administer it			0
there are people offering @entity288 who have no more knowledge or understanding of the way the facial muscles work and interact with each other than the postman			0
this is something that irks not just @entity288 ’s critics , but also those responsible practitioners who know what they ’re doing			0
the @entity334 has been banging the legislation drum for years , pleading for the government to make it impossible for anyone except a qualified medical professional to administer the substance			0
this month ’s report on proposals to regulate the cosmetic surgery industry ( following the @entity346 implant scandal ) was about as much use as a chocolate teapot			0
i am lucky : my job gives me access to the best in the business — the likes of dr @entity355 , dr @entity356 and dr @entity357			0
i have @entity288 to try to reduce the size of my jaw muscles which , after years of tooth - grinding , are so over-developed they ’re starting to alter the shape of my face			0
it ’s subtle , and it works			0
and it ’s not the root of all evil			0
@entity369 ( £ 43 , victoria health.com ) this all - purpose balm is a godsend for older , compromised skins that are especially prone to scarring and splitting			0
medicine cabinet or bedside table ? up to you			0
@entity379 yield to no one in my admiration for @entity383			0
but look : he ’s orange ! perhaps he ’s been taking style tips from @entity386			1
next thing you know , he ’ll be wearing his trousers around his armpits .			0

at 68 , @entity5 shoes how a mature woman can still turn heads
beauty is combo of style , confidence , diet and , of course , products
