' more than 120 million copies have sold worldwide , along with cartoons , a feature film , a musical , stuffed animals , key chains , posters and stickers			0
images of @entity5 have appeared everywhere from museums to the @entity40			2
' a lot of people were @entity5 fans and that makes them @entity0 fans , too , ' said his wife of 56 years			1
@entity5 became standard nighttime reading for countless families and a money machine for publisher @entity51 spinoffs include cartoons with @entity54 as the voice of @entity5 and future ' @entity58 ' novelist @entity57 among the script writers			2
@entity51 , which became a top children 's publisher thanks in part to @entity5 , installed bright red cushions on the chairs in the corporate headquarters ' auditorium in @entity67			2
@entity51 had been in business for decades before @entity5 , but the series ' success inspired the publisher to look for other stories with brand appeal , including ' goosebumps , ' ' @entity74 ' and ' @entity75			1
' @entity0 had completed two more @entity5 books to be released next year , @entity51 said in a statement			1
missed : @entity78 , who brought delight to millions of readers young and old as the author of @entity5 the @entity5 series of books , died on friday , december 12 , at @entity12 in his pre-clifford life , @entity0 was a filmstrip and slide illustrator , trying to break into children 's publishing to support his family			1
his work had been rejected all over @entity67 when an editor at @entity91 ( now @entity92 ) suggested he try writing a story to go with a picture he had submitted of a child and her horse - sized dog			0
@entity0 's idea : thanks to the girl 's affection , a puppy - the runt of the litter - grows into a klutzy but good - hearted behemoth , as big as the lighthouses on the author 's imaginary ' @entity107			2
' a nearby paint container inspired @entity0 to color @entity5 fire engine red			1
@entity0 had sketched a bloodhound because he wanted one while growing up and he named the girl @entity5 , after his daughter			1
he planned to call the dog ' @entity114 , ' but his wife , @entity6 , suggested ' @entity5 , ' the name of an imaginary friend she had as a child			1
@entity0 spent a weekend working up a story			2
several publishers turned the book down before editor @entity124 of @entity51 's ' @entity125 " saw @entity5 's potential			2
' i said to my wife , " now do n't count on there being any more			0
this one is just a fluke			0
i do n't know if there will ever be another one , " ' @entity0 told @entity131 in 2012			0
beloved : illustrator @entity0 , an @entity135 native , @entity0 chose what became a successful career in illustrating children 's books despite heart - breaking rejections from various publishing houses @entity0 achieved mainstream success without mainstream distribution			1
@entity51 offered the first @entity5 story through book clubs and school fairs ( @entity5 was n't available in stores until the 1980s ) and it sold well enough that @entity51 published a second , @entity150 book by @entity0 , ' @entity151			1
' over the years , @entity0 added such ' @entity5 ' sidekicks as the purple poodle @entity154 , the three - legged training dog @entity156 and @entity5 's cranky schoolmate , @entity157			1
@entity0 's name was a ringer for @entity161 's and @entity162 's books were also a comforting portrait of stability and innocence			2
but he did work in social commentary , such as including children of different racial and ethnic backgrounds			0
' i visited a school in @entity172 and some kid said , ` why do you have these black people in the book ? " ' @entity0 told @entity131 in a 2011 interview			2
' i said that we wanted to have a little mix of races and nationalities and not just a purely lily white town			0
' sudden success : an editor at @entity91 advised @entity0 him that he might find success by writing a story about one of his pictures and because of his young daughter , wrote about a dog @entity0 said he came up with ideas for @entity5 by watching other dogs			1
@entity5 would often get himself in trouble , scattering garbage on the lawn or crushing a fence , then redeem himself as only a big dog could , whether saving a drowning child or gently gripping a stranded car between his teeth and carrying it to the nearest garage			0
@entity0 believed @entity5 's imperfections were part of his appeal , making kids more forgiving of their own mistakes			1
while he denied that @entity5 was based on himself , @entity208 disagreed			0
' he 's never been able to recognize that , ' she told the @entity131 ' @entity5 tries to do the right thing , @entity0 tries to do right the thing , and he makes a mess of it			1
but he 's the most lovable grown - up man			0
he 's just a nice guy			0
' ' i 'm not really all that nice , ' the author responded , ' but i try to be			0
' @entity0 was born in @entity216 , @entity135 , in 1928			0
he was not a star in art or writing classes , but his mechanical skills were so much worse that a high school shop teacher suggested he stick to drawing			0
after graduation , he attended the @entity224 in @entity225 , then moved to @entity67 and studied at @entity226			0
@entity0 spent much of the 1950s as a commercial artist			0
