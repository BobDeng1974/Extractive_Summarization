the family of a @entity2 teenager executed after being convicted of murder and rape 18 years ago , howled in anguish as he was declared innocent by a court today in a rare u-turn by the country 's courts			1
@entity10 was just 18 when he was found guilty of raping and murdering a woman in @entity13 , @entity14 , in 1996 and was put to death just 61 days after the woman was murdered			1
but doubt was cast on the verdict when another man confessed to the crime in 2005 , leading to the case being reopened by the @entity22 in @entity23 last month			1
in papers issued to the family at their home , the court ruled the original guilty verdict to be ' not consistent with the facts ' and having ' insufficient evidence '			1
as he delievered the papers @entity57 , the deputy president of the court , made a profound apology for its mistake in sentencing the teenager , also known as @entity62 , to death after @entity10 's mother @entity25 had to be dragged from the teenager 's grave as she wailed in pain , his brother @entity64 told @entity68 : ' my mother wished him ' rest in peace ' and hoped he could reincarnate			1
' mr @entity57 gave @entity10 's parents compensation of 30,000 yuan ( £ 3,093 ) , the official @entity72 reported			1
the money was a personal donation by the head of the court , it added , rather than an official payment by the institution			0
@entity10 's parents @entity81 , left , and @entity25 , centre , receive news of the court ruling today @entity10 's mother falls upon the grave of her son , branded a rapist after his wrongful conviction for murder ' this is an amazing thing the court did , to admit that they were wrong , ' said @entity93 , deputy director of the research institute of the @entity95			1
' it also sends a clear message to the police and prosecutors around the country – if there 's not enough evidence , do n't impose wrongful convictions , ' he told @entity104			0
' in the future this case will be singled out as what not to do and will influence the entire legal system			0
' in @entity10 's case , authorities interrogated the teenager for 48 hours , after which he confessed to having raped and choked the woman in the toilet of a textile factory , the state - run @entity110 newspaper reported last month			1
after he was executed in june 1996 , @entity10 's family tried for nearly two decades to prove his innocence			1
finally it was found @entity10 's confession did not match the autopsy report , was inconsistent with ' other evidence ' , and that dna evidence presented at the trial did not definitively connect him to the crime			2
police in @entity13 , the capital of @entity14 where the crime took place , said they had opened an investigation into the officers responsible for the original case , according to the @entity133			2
@entity10 's parents face the media after news of their son 's conviction had been quashed came through @entity25 burns a copy of the court statement in protest at her son 's wrongful execution @entity10 's parents have campaigned for nearly two decades to have their son 's conviction overturned @entity2 has occasionally exonerated wrongfully executed convicts after others came forward to confess their crimes , or in some cases because the supposed murder victim was later found alive			1
in one case , police claimed a body was that of a woman who had recently disappeared and charged @entity155 with her murder			2
@entity155 was executed by firing squad in 1989 , but in 1993 the supposedly murdered woman returned to the village saying she had been kidnapped			0
@entity155 was exonerated of all crimes in 2005			0
several other high - profile wrongful convictions have sparked public outrage in recent years			0
last year , a man who served 17 years in prison for killing his wife was declared innocent by an appeals court in the eastern province of @entity168			0
a few months earlier two men who had been sentenced to death and life in prison in 2004 for the alleged rape of a 17 - year - old girl , were also acquitted			0
many on social media decried what they saw as insufficient compensation for such a grave miscarriage of justice , with one asking : ' is 30,000 yuan really enough to buy the life of a family member ? ' campaign groups and experts welcomed the court decision and said it was a signal to the rest of the justice system that it must perform better			2
@entity2 's courts , controlled by the ruling @entity191 , have a near - 100 per cent conviction rate in criminal cases and confessions extracted under dubious conditions are commonplace			2
leaders of the ruling party have promised to strengthen the rule of law ' with @entity2 characteristics ' , but experts caution the concept refers to greater central control over the courts , rather than judicial independence			0
the country put an estimated 2,400 people to death last year			0
' the central government wants to use this case to send a clear signal to police and courts that they need to do a better job , ' said @entity215 , @entity2 researcher at @entity216			2
' but without transparency in death penalty cases , it will be hard to determine if progress is being made			0
