the @entity1 ’s new performance director , @entity0 is being paid generously for his expertise			0
but many would have paid a penny for his thoughts on tuesday night			0
the moment he read the quotes of his colleague @entity7 on young @entity8			1
to the uninitiated , @entity8 is @entity12 football ’s new wonderkid			1
@entity15 – @entity0 ’s predecessor – dubbed the @entity18 youth player @entity20 ’s answer to @entity21			1
@entity18 youngster @entity8 in action against @entity23 in the @entity25 match @entity20 under - 19s manager @entity7 has left @entity8 out of his squad for the upcoming games he did so because , by all accounts , @entity8 does not fit the typical @entity12 mould			1
he is not quite a no 9 , not entirely a no 10			0
he is a creative type who scores goals under the watchful eye of @entity18 coach @entity35			1
so far this season he has scored three goals for @entity18 in the @entity25 and is midway through a five - year deal signed in 2012			1
born in @entity39 , near @entity40 , the 18 - year - old is @entity41			0
and @entity43 ’s under - 19 coach @entity42 has used his birth certificate to try to recruit him			1
marvellously , however , @entity8 does not want to play for @entity43			2
his parents are from @entity46			0
he wants to play for @entity20			2
incredibly , @entity20 seems less keen on him			2
@entity7 ’s under - 19 squad are currently preparing for @entity49 elite round with games against @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 this week			1
and @entity8 , dubbed a ‘ luxury ’ player , is nowhere to be found			2
in a throwback to the old school thinking which preceded the @entity1 ’s high - profile 2020 performance strategy , @entity7 explains his absence by saying : ‘ our concentration is on the opening game with @entity51 and we ’ve deliberately got more height in our squad			1
that ’s one of the reasons why @entity8 is n’t in			1
highly rated forward @entity8 has already been linked with moves to @entity68 and @entity69 ‘ the last time he was with us , he did okay , but i wanted a little more impact			2
at @entity18 , he can float all over the place			2
but with us , he has to be more disciplined			0
‘ it ’s purely tactical and there certainly has n’t been a lack of enthusiasm from @entity8 about playing for @entity20			1
’ there might be now , of course			0
most of all when @entity8 learns that young @entity79 , an 18 - year - old striker who plays for @entity80 is in the squad			1
@entity82 , six foot two in his stocking soles , is on loan at @entity86 – a non-league club in the @entity88			0
within the @entity1 , there is a recognition of how damaging and old - fashioned all this looks			0
regarded as a progressive , forward thinking and intelligent coach within the corridors of @entity97 , @entity7 ’s quotes on @entity8 hint at something else			1
for @entity0 , a cerebral former @entity68 colleague of @entity7 ’s , the @entity8 conundrum represents an early test of his diplomatic skills			1
@entity20 boss @entity102 – no giant himself – washed his hands of the matter on tuesday , saying : ‘ i ’m not involved in that at all			2
i let the other guys get on with it			0
i ’ve no idea if it ’s physical or whatever			0
’ @entity8 is currently midway through a five - year deal with @entity18 and is tipped to have a big future pointing out that most of the country has never seen @entity8 play , @entity102 added : ‘ i ’ve seen a few people at @entity115 who never get a game anywhere			1
they go on loan somewhere and disappear into @entity118			0
’ that was the fate of @entity120 – the ‘ wonderkid ’ who turned his back on @entity20 and was last heard of having a loan deal at @entity125 cancelled			2
before leaving his post last october , @entity15 urged @entity12 youth football to rid itself of the ‘ win at all costs ’ mentality and develop skills			0
an appeal which fell on deaf ears with at least one @entity1 colleague			0
‘ we have to match these teams physically , ’ said @entity7 of the challenge facing his under - 19 side			1
‘ the more i ’m seeing games , the more i see things going back to physicality and the height factor			0
’ the irony , of course , is that @entity8 is no midget			2
he is six foot tall			0
taller than @entity145 and @entity146 , the @entity149 - born @entity148 stars allowed to slip through the @entity1 ’s fingers and play for the @entity151 instead			0
the worry is that when the @entity1 host @entity49 games at @entity97 in 2020 , the nation will finally get the chance to see the prodigious talent of @entity8			1
in the red shirt of @entity43 .			0

@entity8 has been left out of the @entity20 under 19s squad for the upcoming games by manager @entity7
@entity7 ’s under - 19 squad are currently preparing for @entity49 elite round
