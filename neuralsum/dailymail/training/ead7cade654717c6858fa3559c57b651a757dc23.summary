a @entity1 bartender had a spell of bad luck turned around after a tipper left a $ 1,000 on a $ 14 bar bill			1
@entity6 was behind the bar at one @entity8 in @entity9 last thursday evening when a local walked in and ordered some drinks			1
@entity6 already had a lot on her mind			2
bills for her daughter 's medical care had been adding up and her washing machine had broken down			1
good luck : just when things seemed at their worst , bartender @entity6 received a $ 1000 tip that helped cover the family 's medical bills and repair costs while the man lingered over a vodka tonic and later a kamikaze , the two discussed her garden and his vacation home in @entity29			1
' it was just a very odd conversation , ' @entity6 said			0
she did n't talk about the problems she was dealing with back home			0
still her luck was due to change			0
the man , a retiree who asked her not to share his name , put a $ 1,000 tip on his credit card			1
with just a $ 14.01 bill , that 's more than 7000 % gratuity			0
she and the management checked to see if there was some mistake , but the man told them to go ahead and charge the gratuity			0
@entity6 made sure to share the generosity , dividing up some of tip with staff at one @entity8			1
' as much as i might have needed the money , you still pay it forward , ' she said			0
' you do n't let greed come into it			0
' @entity58 : a local 's tip blew away the suggested gratuity amounts , and @entity6 made sure to share her windfall with the rest of the staff one whirled cafe has only been open three months and serves a rotating offering of international - inspired plates			1
' it 's slow , ' said @entity6 about business			2
' it 's going to be this way until we build a clientele			0
' but being the recipient of a fortuitous tip has already piqued interest in the area , and one customer said he learned about the restaurant from the flurry of news .			2

@entity6 was worrying about medical bills and a broken washing machine at her bartending shift at one @entity8 , a @entity9 restaurant
the *anonymous* tipper , a retiree who lives in the area , ordered a vodka tonic and a kamikaze , then left a $ 1,000 tip on his card
@entity6 says she passed part of the money to the rest of the staff , the rest helped cover the bills
' you just never think it 's going to *happen* right here in @entity9 . '
