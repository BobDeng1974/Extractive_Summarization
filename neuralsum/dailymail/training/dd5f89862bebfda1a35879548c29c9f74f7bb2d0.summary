by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 to bite another human being is an animalistic instinct and is , quite frankly , inhumane			0
for someone to lower themselves to that level on a football pitch is wholly unacceptable			0
following @entity10 's latest alleged attempt to take a bite out of an opponent , @entity8 must be strong and throw the book at him			1
they must act as the @entity15 have on many occasions in rugby			0
cover up ? @entity10 holds his teeth in pain after allegedly biting @entity21 's @entity20 inhumane : @entity10 appears to bite @entity20 during the @entity23 showdown evidence : @entity20 shows the damage inflicted - and @entity8 should come down hard on @entity10 hurt ? @entity10 holds his mouth after the incident with @entity20 and he should receive a lengthy ban the @entity30 striker has not bitten a fellow professional once			1
he has not even done it twice			0
this is the third time in five years that @entity10 has taken it upon himself to sink his teeth into opposing players			2
there were three years between the first and second incidents , but just 14 months between the second and third			0
action has to be taken to ensure he does not do this again - it must be swift and it must be lengthy			0
@entity8 have announced that they have opened disciplinary proceedings against @entity10 for his alleged bite on @entity20 during @entity44 's 1 - 0 victory over @entity21 , and they must set a precedent			1
in rugby union , the maximum ban for biting an opponent is 208 weeks - or four years - and harsh penalties have been handed out before			2
the rugby authorities are not shy when it comes to long and severe penalties			1
they protect the integrity of the game by preventing heinous acts from being repeated through lengthy bans			0
previous : @entity10 received a seven game ban for biting @entity60 's @entity59 while playing for @entity61 , 2010 controversy : @entity10 ( top left ) is captured biting @entity65 defender @entity64 in april 2013 suspension : @entity68 prop @entity67 received a six - month ban for biting in 1998 attacked : @entity72 @entity71 player @entity70 was bitten by @entity68 prop @entity67 trial : @entity68 prop yates at @entity76 hearing when he was banned for six months for biting lenient : @entity80 hooker @entity79 was only given an eight - week ban due to inconclusive evidence undercover : @entity79 bit @entity85 's @entity84 in a ruck during a @entity88 match ( centre ) wounded : @entity90 ( left ) is attended to by a physio after being bitten by @entity79 when @entity93 prop @entity92 bit @entity95 @entity94 in july 1994 , he was handed an 18 - month suspension from the game			1
in 1998 , @entity68 prop @entity67 also sunk his teeth into an opponent , biting @entity101 flanker @entity70 's ear , and he received a six - month ban			1
and @entity80 hooker @entity79 received an eight - week suspension for biting @entity85 's @entity90 during the @entity88 in 2012 - a lenient ban considering the minimum should be 12 weeks , but the evidence was not strong enough to penalise him further			2
if it had been conclusive then he would have been looking at a matter of months , not weeks			0
if football 's governing body follow rugby 's example then they will come down on @entity10 like a ton of bricks			2
it is time that @entity8 act properly and are hard on a persistent offender of a disgusting act			2
hot water : @entity10 clutches his teeth after appearing to bite @entity20 minutes before @entity44 scored nonplussed : @entity10 ( left ) celebrates the 1 - 0 win with his team - mate @entity121 too often is it said that football should follow rugby 's example in many aspects of the game , but on this occasion they most certainly should			1
@entity10 received a 10 - match ban from the @entity130 for biting @entity65 ' @entity64 last year and a seven - game suspension for sinking his teeth into @entity60 's @entity132 while he was at @entity61			1
if you add those two together then you would still be nowhere near the length of the ban that should be given out			0
for a persistent offender the retribution must be severe			0
a four - year ban like in rugby ? maybe not quite , but @entity8 should be thinking in terms of years and months , not weeks , when they serve @entity10 's sentence .			1

@entity10 appeared to bite @entity21 's @entity20 on *tuesday* night
he received 10 - game ban for biting @entity65 's @entity145 last year
@entity10 got seven - match suspension for biting @entity60 's @entity132 in 2010
@entity8 should hand out long and severe ban to the @entity150 , like in rugby
rugby authorities have given out length *punishments* for biting in past
@entity93 prop @entity92 given 18 - month suspension in 1994
@entity68 prop @entity67 received six - month ban in 1998
@entity44 beat @entity21 1 - 0 to *progress* to the last *16* of @entity*16*2 2014
