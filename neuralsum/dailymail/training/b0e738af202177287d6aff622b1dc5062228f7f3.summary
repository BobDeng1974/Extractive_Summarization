@entity0 can see right through the masterpieces of @entity2 and @entity3			1
the @entity5 electrical and computer engineering professor is a digital art detective , able to unlock the mysteries of a work 's age and authenticity by analyzing its underlying canvas or paper			2
using high - resolution x-ray images , the 64 - year - old academic can actually determine if paintings came from the same bolt of hand - loomed canvas , each of which has a varying thread density pattern that can be as unique as a fingerprint			1
linking multiple pieces of canvas to the same bolt can shore up arguments for authenticity and even put works in chronological order			0
@entity2 's @entity29 on a @entity30 at the @entity31 at @entity5 : @entity0 , a @entity5 computer engineering professor , has developed a way to date and authenticate the centuries - old works by analysing x-ray images of the art professor @entity0 sits in room of the @entity31 : museums in the @entity38 and @entity39 rely on his algorithm , which analyses thread densities and average thread counts in canvas and paper it 's a valuable service to world - class museums that comes through the unlikely cross-pollinating of traditional art history and contemporary computer science			1
' by mixing the two groups we 've been able to do more than either group had been able to do separately studying the paintings , ' prof @entity0 said in a room full of @entity56 paintings at @entity5 's @entity57			2
' we 're not trying to replace the art historian , we 're trying to extend their reach			0
' prof @entity0 is a tech whiz and an art lover — the rare person able to speak with authority about @entity2 's brush strokes and adaptive feedback systems theory			1
although he did n't make his first visit to an art museum until he was a student on fellowship in @entity72 , the rooms full of @entity68 left him thunderstruck			0
notes from a previous dealer or collector are seen on the back of @entity2 's etching , @entity78 ( with @entity79 ) : professor @entity0 's technique is an essential tool for judging a work 's authenticity @entity2 's signature : researchers have been conducting science - based analyses of artworks for some time			1
but it has become more common to use computers to analyse large amounts of digital data prof @entity0 did n't make his first visit to an art museum until he was a student on fellowship in @entity72 @entity95 , curator of earlier @entity39 and @entity96 at the @entity31 , with prof @entity0 outside the @entity31 at @entity5 in @entity97 , @entity98 prof @entity0 melded the two worlds in 2007 with a stint as an adjunct research fellow at the @entity102 in @entity103			1
he began examining high - resolution x-ray images of the canvases used by the 19th century master			1
eventually , prof @entity0 and @entity108 professor @entity107 ( no relation ) developed digital ' weave density maps ' of canvases that added computational power to what had been a painstaking process that required scholars to study small samples with magnifying glasses			1
' it turns out with the eye , you make mistakes , ' said @entity122 , senior researcher at the @entity3 museum			0
mr @entity124 sees the weave maps as an important tool in the ongoing work of precisely dating and ordering all of @entity3 's paintings			2
the technique has also provided evidence to date @entity132 's ' @entity131			0
' a separate analysis of 24 @entity135 canvases supported the sometimes doubted attribution of one painting and provided fresh evidence to link two paintings at the @entity140 in @entity141 as complementary works			0
' it 's one more technical tool in the box of studying pictures , ' said @entity146 , curator of @entity39 paintings at @entity148 in @entity149 , who worked with @entity0 on the @entity150			2
' you take this added evidence and you join it with — in the case of the two @entity154 in @entity141 — pigment analysis , the iconography of the pictures , whether they were together in their history at earlier dates			0
' paper chain line patterns resembling stripes can be seen on the paper used by @entity2 for his self - portrait when it is held against a window			2
prof @entity0 has switched his energies from canvas to paper recently clues : a watermark of a foolscap , upper right centre , is seen faintly on the etching @entity78 researchers have been conducting science - based analyses of artworks for some time			1
but it has become more common to use computers to analyse large amounts of digital data			0
it 's sometimes called computational art history and also includes assessing brushstrokes for distinctive patterns			0
prof @entity0 in recent years has left the canvas to other researchers as he focuses on paper			2
he 's been analysing the old - fashioned paper used by @entity2 for his prints , which was made by laying pulp on screens			1
scholars know the dates when @entity2 etched the copper plates to make the prints , but they are often less sure when an individual print was made			0
was it one of the initial prints or did it come years later after the artist 's death ? prof @entity0 is using high - resolution digital images of @entity2 prints owned by @entity5 's museum to try to discern patterns that the screens impressed on the back of the prints			1
separate prints cut from the same larger sheet of paper could be matched to provide the same sort of contextual information revealed by studying canvas			0
the details are different , but the idea of searching for useful patterns is the same , as is the idea of bridging the gap between art and tech. ' my philosophy all along has been to convince both sides that this is worth doing and they should be talking to each other , ' prof @entity0 said .			0

@entity0 uses high - res x-rays to *forensically* examine canvases
he helped develop digital ' weave density maps ' to analyse the canvases
now he has switched his attentions to paper and @entity2 's prints
