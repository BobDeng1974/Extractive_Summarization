@entity2 has been here before with the press questioning him , his players seemingly confused by his philosophy and the public bemused as the season tailspins into mediocrity			1
the only difference on the previous occasion was that @entity10 tired of the challenge and gave up			1
it was 2008 and he was at @entity13 , an admittedly different proposition to @entity15			1
but the ingredients were similar			0
the club was under - achieving , languishing in 11th place when they had been expected to challenge at the top of the table			0
and it seemed as if the players could not grasp what he was demanding from them			0
he resigned from @entity13 in march 2008			1
@entity2 , pictured in training on friday , takes @entity15 to face @entity26 at @entity27 @entity28 celebrates scoring @entity15 's final goal in their 3 - 0 win against @entity31 last weekend @entity10 , pictured in 2007 , resigned as manager of @entity13 only to return to the club and win the title but then something remarkable occurred in the form of a players ' mutiny			1
the team rebelled against @entity10 's own decision to walk out leave them and demanded him back			1
led by captain @entity43 , central defender and vice-captain @entity45 , midfielder @entity46 and @entity48 goalkeeper @entity47 the team leaders asked for a crisis meeting with the directors and the owner of the club			2
' we felt insulted when the club told us @entity10 was leaving , ' said @entity45			1
' the entire squad , felt that @entity10 is the right man and the only man who could take this club and our squad to a higher level			1
' as @entity15 travel to @entity26 on sunday with @entity63 qualification hanging in the balance , the question is whether @entity15 's players and directors would do the same for @entity10 today			1
of course , thing are n't quite as bad as they were at @entity13			1
after all , three defeats in 24 games would be satisfactory for most clubs			0
and last week 's 3 - 0 win against @entity31 was a possibly the first sign that a new successful @entity15 team could emerge in the @entity76 era			1
@entity43 , pictured during his days as an @entity13 player , did not want @entity10 to leave the club @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 ( left to right ) train ahead of their trip to @entity27 indeed before sunday 's game at @entity27 , @entity10 was confident enough to talking about extending his time at @entity86 beyond his current three - year deal			1
' this will be my last job but there could be five years to go yet , ' he said			0
' i can extend my contract			0
i 'm in a situation where i signed for three years because you can build something up in that time and the club agreed with that			0
i do n't know how i would react in the circumstances when @entity15 ask me to extend , and if i should do that			1
' perhaps their 3 - 0 win over @entity31 last weekend could be viewed as the @entity15 players own vote of confidence in their manager			1
@entity28 later revealed that he had spoken to the team the night before and certainly it seemed as though they might have finally ' got ' the elusive @entity10 philosophy			1
and not before time : sunday 's clash with @entity26 could be defining for judging @entity10 's first season a success or failure			1
put baldy , finish fourth and @entity10 can be broadly satisfied ; finish fifth and he can expect to be questioned as to whether he is still among the top coaches in the world			2
it is crude and unsatisfactory measure of his first season â€“ a point here or there might make the difference between fourth of fifth			0
@entity10 has revealed the @entity15 job will be his last but he could extend his contract at @entity86 but @entity10 needs to demonstrate that @entity15 are making progress and qualification for the @entity63 is the only tangible way to do so			1
last sunday 's victory was welcome , but was notable for being one of the few outstanding performances this season			0
the defeats at @entity137 and to @entity138 in the @entity139 are still fresh in the mind			0
at times @entity15 's players seem to be inhibited by @entity10			1
some at @entity15 believe he has been in danger of losing credibility among the players at times when he spoke about his ' philosophy ' , given the amount of times he has changed his formation			1
in addition , the players have seemed ' strangled ' by @entity10 at times , said one @entity15 source			1
his sheer intensity seems to overwhelm them			0
at @entity156 they would relate to that			0
they remember him there as coach brought back discipline to the squad and who introduced fresh intensity and a crisper , sharper passing game , a tactical prerequisite for a modern elite @entity63 club			1
the @entity156 players found their standards had to rise considerably to meet @entity10 's expectations of passing accuracy and the foundations he laid have helped build the success of the club since he left			2
the @entity156 players felt they had to raise their standards considerably while @entity10 was at the helm but his discipline eventually was perceived as eccentric and bizarre , according to some at @entity156			2
the self - confidence , which helped underpin the team as they won the @entity181 and @entity139 double in the first season and reached the @entity63 final , became a liability as he sought to control more and more areas of the club			2
they still talk with wide - eyed astonishment about the day he dropped his trousers in team talk to demonstrate that he had the ' balls ' to drop any of the star players			0
and they still raise their eyebrows at the manner in which @entity10 organised meal times after training			2
lunch time was a communal affair			0
and at @entity156 , the whole team had to be assembled in matching kit before @entity10 would give the signal for the meal to start			2
he once refused to allow the highly - respected club doctor , @entity205 , who was then in his 60s , to join in lunch until he had gone back to change his socks			0
@entity205 was in his white club socks and the stipulated dress code was red socks			0
his obsession with order carries over on the pitch and his greatest strength for some and his biggest weakness for others			0
@entity219 , his great football adversary , is one of those unimpressed with his need to control			0
@entity219 says @entity10 is a very good organiser but that 's not the way he likes to do things ' the difference is that he always organises a lot of things for people , ' said @entity219			2
' i always use the basic quality of people to achieve what i want to achieve			0
that 's a different way of thinking			0
i always love that they do things			0
and when it goes wrong , well , try to correct it in one way or another			0
his way is more as a very good organiser			0
that 's the way he is ' of course , when he gets it right and a club or a group of players buy into what he has to offer , @entity10 can be phenomenally successful as his time , at @entity251 and his early days at @entity252 and @entity156 demonstrate			2
and , of course , at @entity13			2
that famous meeting , when the players begged him to stay at the @entity257 club was a heated and emotional affair in which @entity10 demanded the fill support and commitment of the players if he were to stay			1
the following season they won the @entity257 league , the first time for 27 years that it had been won by a team other than @entity266 , @entity251 or @entity267			2
if he can do the same for @entity15 next season , his genius will be confirmed			2
if they lose on sunday and the club 's trajectory does n't change , he wo n't need to worry about what to do when he sitting down with the @entity275 to extend his contract			0
@entity15 face @entity26 in a crucial @entity278 fixture at @entity27 on sunday			1

@entity2 resigned at @entity13 but the squad demanded his return
he came back and led the @entity257 outfit to the @entity285 title in 2009
@entity10 is now trying to *implement* his own philosophy at @entity86
