despite a vast security clampdown , riot police and army units allowed the peaceful crowds to vent their anger in the biggest rallies the country has seen since the fall of the @entity8			1
as many as 50,000 massed at @entity10 ’s @entity9 near the @entity11			0
last night , protesters issued an ultimatum to prime minister @entity30 to cancel ‘ fraudulent ’ parliamentary elections and stage a rerun – or face an even larger mass protest in two weeks			1
the authorities deployed more than 50,000 police and soldiers for yesterday ’s rallies but there was no repeat of the arrests at smaller spontaneous protests earlier last week			2
armoured vehicles blocked access to @entity49 and government buildings around the @entity11 and tiny spy helicopters monitored the crowds			2
authoritarian former @entity53 spy @entity30 – who plans to return to the @entity11 as president in march – now faces his most acute political crisis since coming to power			1
standing room only : an aerial view of the rally in @entity9 flaring up : protesters walk amidst smoke from a flare in the city centre to attend a sanctioned rally in @entity9 yesterday , he kept a low profile , monitoring the extraordinary scenes from his official residence near @entity10			0
last night his spokesman said : ‘ the government can not yet formulate its attitude to the many thousands meeting at @entity9			0
’ there were even calls from the crowd for @entity30 to be jailed over the ‘ rigged ’ parliamentary poll , which his @entity22 party narrowly won last week , and the endemic corruption which is rampant at all levels throughout the country			1
independent observers suggest @entity22 ’s vote was inflated from about 25 per cent to 50 per cent of the total share , enough to give an overall majority			2
exact estimates on the size of yesterday ’s protest varied but there was agreement it is the largest @entity30 has seen			1
‘ maybe 100,000 people were at this rally , ’ declared @entity89 , @entity30 ’s first prime minister but now a bitter enemy			1
‘ @entity93 for these thieving authorities			0
’ anger : an elderly @entity16 holds up a poster of prime minister @entity30 which reads no ! as thousands packed into @entity10 to protest against the elections voices heard : protesters are congregating in @entity10 's city centre to protest against the rigged election packed out : @entity9 is filled with tens of thousands of protesters all campaigning against the rigged elections anti-putin : protesters hold a red banner reading ' @entity107 ' during the rally against sunday 's election results organised dissent : @entity16 walk into @entity10 's city centre for the sanctioned rally in @entity9 calm before the storm ? @entity114 officers stand guard as crowds flock into @entity117 ( left ) as @entity120 leader @entity119 ( right ) also protests overthrow : opposition protesters in the southern @entity16 city of @entity123 took to the streets today taking a stand : protesters also congregated on the streets of the @entity32 city of @entity129 and ex-deputy premier @entity119 , briefly jailed for taking part in an earlier protest , said : ‘ the current regime does not know how to behave with dignity			1
all they know is cynicism			0
’ leading @entity16 novelist @entity136 said : ‘ i have n’t seen such things for 20 years , since 1991			1
there ’s no way back from events such as these			0
’ as the protests unfolded , the websites of @entity16 ’s two major state - run channels ignored developments in an act of @entity8 - style censorship			1
in @entity151 , protesters chanted slogans and displayed banners outside the houses of @entity155			1
and @entity10 rally organiser , opposition politician @entity157 , has announced there will be another protest on december 24 , which he says will be twice as large			2
the protests come three months before @entity30 , who was president from 2000 to 2008 and effectively remained the country 's leader while prime minister , is to seek a third term in office			1
the public outpouring challenges his image , supported by state - controlled tv channels , as a man who won the affection of most @entity16			1
that image was undercut by last sunday 's parliamentary elections , during which his @entity173 narrowly retained a majority of seats			2
ex-pat protest : @entity16 gathered outside the @entity177 in @entity151 to also rally against what they think was a fraudulent election process but it lost the unassailable two - thirds majority it held in the previous parliament			1
even that reduced performance was unearned , inflated by massive vote fraud , the opposition says , citing reports by local and international monitors of widespread violations			2
the reports of vote - rigging and the party 's loss of seats acted as a catalyst for long - simmering discontent of many @entity16			1
' the falsifications that authorities are doing today have turned the country into a big theater , with clowns like in a circus , ' said @entity203 , one of the early arrivals for the protest at @entity9 , on an island in the @entity207 adjacent to the @entity11			1
opposition : protesters took to the streets of @entity16 's far eastern city of @entity212 today to show their anger against the alleged rigged elections anger : one of the first protests of the day took part in @entity212 claims : crowds gathered in @entity212 to protest against the ruling @entity22 party ' i do n't think any citizen of the country can say he is very happy with anything			1
we do n't have an independent judiciary , there is no freedom of expression - all this combined creates a situation where people are forced to protest , ' said demonstrator @entity232 , who was dressed in civilian clothes but identified himself as a member of the @entity16 army			1
by the time the rally started , the square and adjacent streets were packed shoulder - to - shoulder with protesters braving intermittent wind - blown snow			2
city authorities have given permission for a rally of up to 30,000 people , unusual largesse for an opposition that generally is either denied permission to rally or limited to small numbers			0
it was not clear if police would choose to crack down if the crowd clearly exceeded 30,000			0
but they did try to move demonstrators off a footbridge leading to the island , claiming it was so packed with people that it could collapse			0
protests took place in at least 15 other cities from the @entity263 to the southwest			1
day of action : a protester in @entity212 holds a cut - out from @entity268 showing the the face of @entity16 blogger , political and social activist @entity270 international criticism : the elections which saw @entity16 prime minister @entity30 ( left ) voted back into power have been condemned by @entity276 secretary of state @entity275 ( right ) in the @entity278 of @entity212 , several hundred protesters rallied along a waterside avenue where some of @entity16 's @entity281 warships are docked			1
they shouted ' @entity30 's a louse ' and some held a banner caricaturing @entity22 's emblem , reading ' the rats must go '			1
and in the eastern city of @entity288 , observers said more than 10,000 took to the streets			2
police stayed on the fringes of that demonstration and made no arrests			0
but the @entity295 news agency reported that about 15 people were arrested at a protest in the @entity32 city of @entity299 and about 30 in the @entity33 city of @entity301 when a flash - mob started an unauthorized protest			2
officials in many cities , including @entity10 , gave permission for the protests			0
but in what appeared to be an attempt to prevent young people from attending the protest , @entity10 's school system declared saturday afternoon a mandatory extra school day for grades 9 - 11			2
students were told of the decision only on friday , news reports said			0
hundreds of people , were arrested in smaller protests earlier in the week			0
some , including prominent opposition blogger @entity270 , were sentenced to 15 days in jail			0
another prominent opposition figure , @entity322 , was hospitalized after his monday arrest and was expected to be released saturday , but the @entity295 news agency said he was taken from the hospital to a court to face further charges			0
president @entity327 conceded this week that election law may have been violated and @entity30 suggested ' dialogue with the opposition - minded ' - breaking from his usual authoritarian image			1
the @entity11 has come under strong international pressure , with @entity276 secretary of state @entity275 calling the vote unfair and urging an investigation into fraud			0
the opposition predicts at least 30,000 demonstrators will assemble for the @entity10 protest			0
if today 's protests are a success , the activists then face the challenge of long - term strategy			0
even though @entity276 sen. @entity345 recently tweeted to @entity30 that ' the @entity346 is coming to a neighborhood near you ' , things in @entity16 are not that simple			1
the popular uprisings that brought down governments in @entity351 in 2003 , in @entity352 the next year and in @entity353 last spring all were significantly boosted by demonstrators being able to establish round - the - clock presences , notably in @entity357 's @entity356 and the massive tent camp on @entity360 's main avenue			0
@entity16 police would hardly tolerate anything similar			2
in @entity352 and @entity351 , police were low - profile , staying on the edges of the protests and keeping their numbers small			0
it is seen as a far cry from @entity16 police 's usual crowd - controlling method of flooding any protest zone with hundreds of helmeted police who seem to relish violence			1
opposition figures indicated today that the next step would be to call another protest in @entity10 for next weekend , with the aim of making it even bigger			0
but staged events at regular intervals may be less effective than daily spontaneous protests			0
the opposition is also vulnerable to attacks on the websites and social media that have nourished the protests			0
this week , an official of @entity390 , a @entity16 social networking site , reported pressure from the @entity393 , the @entity53 's main successor , to block access to opposition groups , but said his company refused			1
on election day , the websites of a main independent radio station and the country 's only independent election - monitoring group fell victim to denial - of - service hacker attacks			2
allegations : an election committee empties a ballot box after voting closed at a polling station last sunday			0
there are now fears mass ballot - box stuffing took place			0

@entity416 flood *capital* 's streets , but allow peaceful protestors to vent anger

demonstrations took place in 70 cities across the country
president @entity30 even faced calls to be jailed over ' rigged ' vote
