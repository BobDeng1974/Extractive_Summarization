a new year dawns and with it there is new hope for @entity3			1
nothing extraordinary yet , nothing on a par with that remarkable run in last season ’s @entity9 title race			1
but hope all the same that the problems of the last six months are being left behind as the door closes on 2014			2
the green shoots of recovery were clearly evident in the win over @entity16 at @entity17 on monday night			1
it was @entity3 ’s biggest win of the season , but the manner of victory is what will please @entity24 most ; a return to the high - energy , high - intensity , performances of last season when his team seemed capable of sweeping aside all before them			1
there was enough to suggest that even without @entity34 , @entity35 and , of course , @entity37 , @entity3 are capable of getting back to those sort of levels using the players @entity24 signed in the summer			1
@entity3 celebrate their fourth goal against @entity16 on monday night as they ease to victory @entity43 was excellent , producing his best performance in a @entity3 shirt to date by scoring twice			1
@entity46 will not want to see the first of those two again , but the way @entity43 closed down the @entity16 goalkeeper ’s clearance is exactly what @entity24 wants to see from his players			1
‘ that was what was missing from our way of working for the first period of the season , ’ said the @entity3 boss			1
‘ we are a team that plays with a big pressure			2
we have got technically gifted players in the team , but that ability to press the ball allows them to create chances at the far end of the field			2
we ask the players to go and press and he got his reward			2
’ alongside @entity43 and @entity74 in attack , @entity73 was imperious , looking every inch a @entity78 no 10			2
@entity79 and @entity80 were everywhere in midfield , @entity83 ’s constant incursions down the left flank were rewarded with his first @entity17 goal , and @entity86 fitted seamlessly into a back three			1
@entity87 playmaker @entity73 was back to his best on monday night @entity89 midfielder @entity43 scored twice as he put in arguably his best performance in a @entity3 shirt some of the changes might have been brought on by circumstance and necessity towards the back end of a busy @entity97 programme , but @entity24 insisted that signs of a return to the high intensity displays of last season were even there in the depressing 3 - 0 defeat at @entity104 earlier this month			1
‘ if you look at how we played against @entity108 , we conceded poor goals , but the creativity started that day , ’ said the @entity105			0
‘ we looked at a shape and system that could get us back to how we played last year			0
we did n’t quite get that result but i saw enough			0
‘ we moved on to @entity115 and played really well			0
@entity116 we deserved more again , and the performance was better			0
we had to show a different side against @entity119 but on monday night we came out and had the intensity and work - rate to get a reward			1
our creativity was very much there , but a solid base was behind it and that is key for us			0
‘ the last two or three weeks the performance level has been much more what we were over the course of the last 18 months			0
a lot of work , a lot of hours go in to find a tactical idea to get back to that			0
when you have the players that want to press the ball and work as hard as we did , and have the quality to back that up , then you can be a really hard team to play against			0
’ @entity24 gives @entity74 a pat on the cheek after substituting the youngster it would be wrong to think that everything has suddenly turned rosy for @entity24			1
elsewhere on monday night , there were reminders of issues that still need to be resolved			1
on the substitutes bench , for instance , @entity152 sat alongside @entity155 and @entity156			0
ideally , @entity3 would like to offload two of them in the january transfer window but only @entity156 is likely to go if a £ 6million buyer can be found			2
it speaks volumes that @entity24 was happy to leave out his three conventional strikers while once again asking @entity74 to play out of position and lead the line			2
the wisdom of signing forwards like @entity155 and @entity152 for a team designed to play a pressing game seems as curious now as it did five months ago			0
the goalkeeping situation clearly needs addressing as well			0
@entity170 looks like a goalkeeper who knows he is only back in the team because of an injury to @entity174 , and @entity176 ’s header in the build - up to @entity16 ’s goal was a reminder that @entity24 is still short of top - class defenders			1
@entity3 goalkeeper @entity170 still looks short on confidence despite being recalled no - one is getting carried away just yet although @entity43 , for one , believes @entity3 are finally heading in the right direction			1
‘ expectation levels were raised after last season and maybe that all came as a bit of a shock to some of the new players , ’ said the £ 25m signing from @entity187			0
‘ but we ’ve settled in now and we ’re just gelling that little bit more as a team			0
‘ we believe we ’ve turned the corner in the last few weeks			0
in no way are we there yet – there ’s still a lot of hard work to do			0
’ the @entity201 faithful will be hoping there 's plenty more to cheer about in 2015			2

@entity3 beat @entity16 4 - 1 at @entity17 on monday night
@entity24 ' side are *eighth* in the @entity9 and have been knocked out of the @entity207
but signs are promising for 2015 on the evidence of monday night
