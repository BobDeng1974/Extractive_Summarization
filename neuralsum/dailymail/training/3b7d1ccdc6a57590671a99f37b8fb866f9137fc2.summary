by @entity0 with hundreds of plastic legs , arms , and heads stacked high in boxes , it looks like a haunting resting place for hundreds of unwanted dolls discarded by girls who no longer want to play with them			0
but although @entity11 's @entity10 does have a cemetery for doll parts that are beyond repair , many of the toy parts littering the workshop are waiting to be given a new lease of life			1
for the company has been the saviour of hundreds of thousands of @entity23 girls devastated when their beloved doll has lost a limb or been damaged in an overly boisterous game and has revived millions of childhood memories			1
@entity31 doll 's parts sit waiting to be used for repair at @entity11 's @entity10 which is celebrating its 100th birthday this year concentrating : @entity34 works on a doll at @entity11 's @entity10 in @entity36 spare parts : hundreds of spare dolls ' arms and legs are kept in boxes at the hospital 's workshop in @entity36 , @entity11 repairs : doll body parts are hung up to dry after being painted at the workshop the workshop is about to mark 100 years of repairing dolls after it was opened thanks to a shipping error in the @entity23 city back in 1913			1
and despite changing technology meaning that many modern children are more interested in the latest gadgets or computer games , the business is still going strong , with dolls sent from all over @entity23 and even across the sea from @entity58 for repair			1
the shop was founded by accident by @entity62 in 1913			2
his brother was in the business of importing celluloid dolls from @entity66 but the rubber bands that held them together would often disintegrate and the dolls would be damaged			1
waiting room : an old fashioned doll , or ' patient ' , sits waiting to be repaired in the @entity73 resting place : a sign saying ' @entity76 ' hangs over a section of the warehouse that is used for waste parts haunting : spare dolls heads , some needed new paintwork , others needing repairs to their eyes , are piled high fortunately for his brother , mr @entity62 found a way to fix the dolls and set up a section dedicated to doll repair in his general store			2
but demand for doll repair grew as word spread and the business was soon expanded			0
it was taken over by mr @entity62 's son , also called @entity62 , in the 1930s and expanded the type of product being fixed to leather goods , toys and umbrellas			0
the start of @entity103 really saw the doll hospital thrive however			0
restrictions on manufacturing and importing goods to @entity23 meant that children and collectors had to make do with their old dolls instead of buying new ones and more repairs were needed			2
getting a spruce up : @entity34 works on making the torso of a doll look the part before its limbs are reattached accidental beginnings : the @entity10 was opened after founder @entity121 's brother ordered celluloid dolls from @entity66 which were damaged in transit labour of love : @entity127 owner @entity126 , the third generation of the @entity126 family to run it , is pictured in the workshop at one point during the war the hospital had 70 ' nurses ' working in six different repair rooms			1
by its 95th birthday , the hospital had carried out a staggering 2.5mllion repairs			0
now , the hospital has been passed onto its third generation of the @entity129 , with @entity144 's son @entity143 now in charge			0
he said on the company 's website : ' there is nothing more satisfying than seeing the smile on a little girl 's face when she comes to collect her beloved doll			0
' people often have tears in their eyes when they have to leave their precious dolls , but tears of joy when they come to collect them and see the transformation			0
' thriving : business really boomed during @entity103 when restrictions on manufacturing and importing goods meant that new dolls were hard to come by for sale : as well as repairing dolls , the hospital also has a range for sale in need of care : a doll has been taken apart and is ready for repair at @entity11 's @entity175			1

@entity11 's @entity177 is celebrating its 100th birthday
it was founded after some dolls were damaged in transit from @entity66 in 1913
dolls are still sent from all over @entity23 and even @entity58 for repair
