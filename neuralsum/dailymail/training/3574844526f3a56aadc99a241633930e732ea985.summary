the amount of greenhouse gases in the @entity3 's atmosphere could be significantly reduced thanks to a membrane created in @entity6			1
the polymer skin filters gases , such as carbon dioxide , out of the atmosphere while allowing oxygen to pass through it			1
researchers believe their polymer membrane , known as @entity15 , will play a vital role in tackling global warming in the future			0
researchers in @entity20 have engineered a membrane ( pictured left ) called pim - 1 , which is ‘ embedded with a network of channels and cavities less than two nanometres in diameter that can trap gases of interest once they enter			1
’ it is hoped the findings may one day lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions and purer skies the material , which has tiny holes invisible to the human eye , is highly porous so it captures harmful chemicals as they pass			2
it is hoped the findings , published in the journal @entity41 , may one day lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions and purer skies			0
the gases , originating from industrial processes and the burning of fossil fuels , blanket the @entity3			0

greenhouse gases , originating from industrial processes and the burning of fossil fuels , blanket the @entity3			0
the most abundant among them is carbon dioxide , which made up 84 per cent of the @entity55 ’ greenhouse gases in 2012 , and can remain in the @entity3 ’s atmosphere for thousands of years			1
countries around the world are searching for ways to reduce their carbon dioxide footprint			1
but the chemical is essentially a waste product with little immediate commercial value and large treatment costs			0
so new low - cost technologies are said to be needed to give industry the incentive to capture it			0

dr @entity77 , from the @entity78 , who also worked on the design , said @entity88 is ‘ embedded with a network of channels and cavities less than two nanometres in diameter that can trap gases of interest once they enter			1

the membrane is significant because it only captures greenhouse gases , and not oxygen to overcome @entity104 ’s weaknesses , the researchers heated the membrane with oxygen at temperatures ranging from 120 to 450 ° , a process referred to as thermal oxidation			2
dr @entity77 continued : ‘ @entity111 , under high temperatures , chemically reacts with @entity15 to reinforce the strength of channels while controlling the size of so - called gate openings leading into the cavities , which allows for higher selectivity			0
’ this made it twice as good at catching carbon dioxide while allowing air to pass through it 100 times faster compared with commercially available polymers			1
the balloon can also be used for other applications such as capturing carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels , enriching the oxygen content in air for efficient combustion engines , hydrogen gas production and processes to generate plastic			1
added project leader professor @entity138 , of @entity20 , @entity6 : ‘ basically , we developed a method for making a polymer that can truly contribute to a sustainable environment			0
' and because it is affordable and long lasting , our polymer could potentially cut the cost of capturing carbon dioxide by as much as 1,000 times			2

the @entity145 membrane was created by researchers from @entity20
skin ‘ sieves ’ harmful gases from air while allowing oxygen to pass through
@entity88 is embedded with a network of cavities two nanometres in diameter
these cavities and channels capture gases , such as carbon dioxide
