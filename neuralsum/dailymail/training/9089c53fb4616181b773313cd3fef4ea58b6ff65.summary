by @entity0 a mother broke down in court today as she described seeing her four - year - old daughter die in hospital after a doctor failed to administer the treatment she needed to save her life			1
@entity8 whispered ' goodbye baby ' to her daughter @entity11 when the girl was being sedated by medics - but it turned out to be the last thing she would ever say to the girl , an inquest heard			1
just 25 minutes later , the four - year - old died from septic shock , covered in her own vomit , after a hospital registrar failed to administer intravenous antibiotics quickly enough			1
@entity23 heard that registrar dr @entity24 prescribed @entity11 oral antibiotics even though her junior colleague @entity26 and nurses at @entity28 in @entity29 disagreed			1
grief : @entity8 , left , has described how she saw her four - year - old daughter @entity11 , right , die in hospital dr @entity26 told the hearing yesterday that dr @entity34 had made her cry by laughing at her suggestion that the girl 's condition was more serious than the senior doctor thought			1
today the inquest into @entity11 's death on november 22 2012 was read a statement from ms @entity8 , who claimed dr @entity34 ' did n't seem concerned ' @entity11 had been vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea for around three days before being admitted to hospital			1
@entity11 's mother took her to the her gp twice before taking her to @entity47 at 9pm on november 21 because she had been ill for five days and was n't getting any better			1
' i was very worried about @entity11 - it seemed her whole body moved when she took a breath , she would make a grunting noise and was wheezy , ' ms @entity8 said			1
' i took @entity11 to @entity28 straight away , i was with her the entire time except for less than a minute when she was put to sleep at 5.40am - i do n't think i even went to the toilet because i wanted to stay with my little girl the entire time			1
@entity58 , 4 , died at @entity28 in @entity29 ( pictured ) from a severe infection after doctors failed to give her antibiotics by the correct method , a hearing was told ' the doctor did n't seemed concerned - at no point until the end did they give the impression that there was something very serious with @entity11			1
they did n't tell me what was wrong or do anything with urgency			0
' after an x-ray of her chest a nurse spoke to me and said @entity11 had a chest infection so would be kept overnight			2
' another doctor , called dr @entity34 , came along as well , she did n't seem to think there was anything wrong with @entity11 either			2
' i was worried because she was clearly unwell just to look at her			0
i remember @entity11 was given oral antibiotics in @entity47 and was sick again after taking the medication			1
my memory is a bit blurred after that - @entity11 was transferred to the children 's ward			1
' after @entity11 's grandmother , @entity88 , arrived on the ward , ms @entity8 contacted her nurse sister as this was the ' main way to get information '			1
she tried to get her daughter to sleep but she was ' clearly scared and wanted hugs ' after vomiting and having diarrhoea in her hospital bed , the inquest heard			2
@entity23 heard that in @entity47 , registrar @entity24 prescribed @entity11 oral antibiotics , but that her junior colleague and nurses did not agree with that course of treatment ' even when we were on the children 's ward not a lot seemed to happen ' , she continued			1
' nothing made me panic until they said they would have to put @entity11 to sleep			1
' as time past @entity11 seemed to get worse			2
i felt helpless because my little girl was crying and asking me to make things better			0
the doctors did n't seem to be doing anything			0
' the inquest hearing had to be paused today after ms @entity8 started weeping while her statement was read to the court			2
ms @entity8 said the first time a doctor told her anything was wrong was when @entity11 was put to sleep to help her breathe			1
she added : ' there were lots of people everywhere - wires and tubes were attached to @entity11 , she was screaming , i had to hold her leg down because there were not enough people to do that			1
' i remember kissing @entity11 saying " goodbye baby ' "			1
i did n't know it was the last thing i would ever say to her			0
dr @entity24 , accused of making @entity11 's mother cry , is seen leaving @entity136 today ' when i was told my little girl had died , it felt like my whole world had died as well			1
' the inquest heard that if septic shock is diagnosed immediately , there is a 95 per cent chance of survival , but the initial mortality rate of five per cent doubles each hour it is not detected and treated			1
dr @entity145 , a paediatric consultant who conducted an investigation into @entity11 's death , told the inquest that by the time doctors realised what was wrong her chances of survival were ' very , very slim '			2
she said : ' @entity11 was extremely tachycardic and in respiratory distress , which was in keeping with the diagnosis of septic shock			1
if this had been recognised earlier , her chances of survival would have been greatly improved			0
' survival for a diagnosis of septic shock is 95 per cent ... by 6am , the chances of survival were very , very slim			1
' the consultant told the inquest that dr @entity34 failed to recognise the ' severity ' of the youngster 's condition , saying she would have expected a ' more comprehensive assessment '			0
however , she added that ' it was not obvious she was unwell ' , saying a ' thorough examination ' is needed to establish a diagnosis of septic shock			1
the criminal charges could be brought if @entity136 coroner dr @entity170 concludes unlawful killing , as the @entity172 would be notified and could prosecute			0
@entity173 , representing @entity11 's family , said : ' @entity175 killing might be an appropriate conclusion - that submission is not meant to be scandalous			2
' there was a failure to appreciate the words from other doctors , a failure to obtain information that would be obtainable and a lack of justification and observation in this case			0
' these features will take you beyond the usual medical failures to gross negligence			0
' in terms of neglect , there was a failure to provide basic medical attention to a vulnerable person who is in a serious condition			0
' neglect is not negligence - a gross failure is not the same as gross negligence			0
' however , dr @entity34 's representative @entity202 , argued against a verdict of unlawful killing because her client noticed the tragic youngster had an infection			0
she said : ' it is absolutely clear that the approach throughout this inquest has n't been founded on suspicion			0
nobody has been asked if this was a gross negligence kind of case			0
' this was n't a case where there was a failure to see if the patient was unwell			0
it was appreciated there was an infection and appreciated it was pneumonia			0
alarm : junior doctor @entity26 repeatedly raised her concerns about the treatment given to @entity11 ' antibiotics were given , fluids , in fact extra fluids , were given			2
' @entity230 , representing @entity231 , added : ' this is a desperately sad case and the @entity231 accepts the standard of care for @entity11 fell far short of what she should have had			2
' to return a verdict of unlawful killing , you would have to be satisfied to the criminal standard and be sure beyond reasonable doubt			0
' @entity241 has taken extensive steps to learn from @entity11 's death and other steps to ensure no other child dies at @entity28 in similar circumstances			2
' the inquest also heard evidence from dr @entity249 , who cried as she told the coroner she could not understand why hospital staff took so long to call her			0
the consultant , who was finally called to examine @entity11 at 5am on november 22 , 2012 , said @entity11 was ' clearly , very ill ' when she came to examine her and that despite her being by far the sickest patient on the ward that night , staff showed little urgency when briefing her			2
' it 's not a situation i 've ever experienced before " , she explained , " it was n't complicated in my opinion , it was very simple , very basic			0
' there was no urgency , no recognition that the situation was an emergency - it is what i call a meandering discussion			0
' i thought calling the consultant was very appropriate because the child was so unwell			0
' she had been the most ill patient on the ward so she should have been in the @entity275 so we could have observed her more closely			0
' the coroner is expected to deliver his verdict on monday			0

@entity8 took daughter @entity11 to @entity47 after she was ill for several days
whispered ' goodbye baby ' to the four - year - old as she was sedated while screaming in agony
but the girl died of septic shock 25 minutes later after doctors failed to put her on intravenous antibiotics
