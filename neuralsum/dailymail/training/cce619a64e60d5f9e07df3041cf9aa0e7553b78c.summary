by @entity0 published : 15:20 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 15:20 est , 22 march 2013 @entity2 words : @entity3 attacked both @entity4 and former @entity6 leader @entity5 @entity3 has launched a devastating attack on @entity4 - and admitted that the last @entity8 left behind a wrecked economy			1
the former labour business secretary ridiculed @entity5 ’s infamous claim to have abolished boom and bust , joking : ‘ well we abolished boom ! ’ and , in a thinly - veiled swipe at mr @entity4 , he said ; ‘ we need to explain how we would retool and redevelop our economy			1
' we need a politician who will fight on that rather than fight about the past or fight over what is fair and what is not fair			2
the @entity6 has got to offer more than that			1
’ in a further blow to @entity24 , @entity25 yesterday backed the @entity27 ’s ‘ free schools ’ initiative , describing it as ‘ a great idea ’			1
the developments threatened to undermine mr @entity24 ’s bid today to relaunch @entity6 as a credible economic force			1
in a speech in @entity35 the @entity6 leader will accuse the @entity27 of condemning @entity36 to a ‘ lost decade of low growth ’			2
mr @entity24 will attack the government ’s economic strategy saying the country can not afford ‘ more of the same ’			0
but in a speech to a @entity44 gathering of businessmen in @entity46 this week , @entity3 urged the @entity6 leadership to move on , and start setting out a positive alternative for the economy			2
‘ the whole argument about whether we ’re cutting too far and too fast - it ’s in the past			0
‘ it is rather predictable party political stuff from over the dispatch box , and it is a bit tiring to the public			0
‘ everyone knows we are in a heck of a bad way in the economy			0
quite a lot more pain is going to be experienced			0
what we should be saying is , “ this is the light at the end of the tunnel			0
this is where we should be heading			0
” ‘ we need to focus on how to redevelop our economy rather than fight about the past and fight about what ’s too far and what ’s far enough			0
’ attack : shadow chancellor @entity4 , pictured , outside the @entity75 studios in @entity76 yesterday was accused of looking backwards and playing the blame game instead of fighting for the future of @entity36 economy just bust : the former business secretary , right , also took a swipe at ex-labour leader @entity5 , left , saying that the party may have abolished the boom , but not the bust in a swipe at mr @entity5 ’s economic record , @entity3 said : ‘ i ca n’t remember who the member of the government was who claimed we abolished boom and bust			1
well , we abolished boom			0
’ @entity6 ’s economic policy under mr @entity4 has focused almost entirely on opposition to the government ’s programme of cuts , with the shadow chancellor repeatedly calling for higher spending and borrowing			1
@entity6 has opposed every cut to the bloated welfare budget and has yet to set out the economic policies on which it will fight the next election			2
polls conducted after the @entity108 this week suggested almost a third of people most trusted the @entity111 to handle the @entity36 ’s economic situation compared to just a quarter for @entity6			2
changing sides : former @entity6 leader and prime minister @entity25 , pictured wednesday , backed the government 's plan on free schools , something which new party leader @entity24 , right , opposes the @entity111 seized on the disarray in @entity6 ’s ranks			1
conservative mp @entity121 said : ‘ even @entity6 ’s former business secretary - a man who knows how to win elections - thinks @entity4 is living in “ the past ”			1
‘ @entity6 have opposed every single saving this government is making to deal with the deficit , and are simply offering more of the same spending , borrowing and debt that got us into this mess in the first place			2
’ in a separate intervention , mr @entity25 also gave fulsome backing to @entity135 ’s free schools initiative , which @entity6 has bitterly opposed under mr @entity24 ’s leadership			1
speaking at a conference in @entity139 the former prime minister also suggested he was not opposed to greater private sector involvement in state education , but said @entity36 was ‘ not ready ’ for a debate on the issue			0
he also accused the teaching unions of obstructing ‘ necessary economic change ’ .			0

former business secretary hit out at both balls and @entity5
accused @entity4 of looking to the past instead of the fighting for the future
further blow to @entity6 as @entity25 backs @entity8 's free schools
