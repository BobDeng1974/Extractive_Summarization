pressure is mounting on three @entity2 grandees to explain their links with a vile group that tried to legalise sex with children			1
mps , commentators and even @entity2 - supporting newspapers lined up yesterday to attack the silence of the party ’s deputy leader @entity11 , her mp husband and former minister @entity14			1
the chorus of condemnation follows the @entity18 ’s devastating series of reports into how the trio held key roles in a human rights organisation that supported the notorious @entity23 ( @entity23 )			1
@entity2 's deputy leader : @entity11 was a newly qualified solicitor when she became the @entity26 's legal officer in 1978 until 1982 will he respond to the @entity18 's questions ? @entity30 ’s home affairs spokesman , @entity29 , sat on the @entity26 executive committee for almost a decade , from 1970 to 1979 although the @entity32 has ignored the story , those calling for the trio to explain themselves include left - wing commentators who would normally be expected to back them			2
@entity38 in the @entity2 - supporting @entity39 angrily demanded that @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity29 speak up about why they supported the paedophile agenda in the 1970s			1
she said : ‘ how can they ever again be taken seriously on any issue if they stay silent ? ’ in the @entity49 newspaper , a columnist said the @entity2 trio ‘ can not stay silent on this child sex claim ’ , adding it would be ‘ a grave mistake for them to stay silent or curtly dismissive , perhaps hoping that the claims will magically disappear ’			2
the @entity56 ’s @entity55 wrote last week : ‘ i ’m with the @entity18 on this one			2
i think @entity40 , @entity29 and @entity14 do need to address this matter seriously			2
’ ' people of different ages being nice to each other ' : the autumn 1982 edition of rights , the in - house magazine of the @entity26			0
self - confessed paedophile @entity64 's letter was published on page 9 ( pictured centre ) document : this is the cover page of the @entity26 's submission to @entity70 on the 1976 @entity71 held at the @entity73 library , which suggests that the age of consent be lowered to 14 damning : on page six of the document it is argued that ' a person aged 14 or over should be legally capable of giving consent ' and the age of sexual consent cut to ten ' if the child understood the nature of the act ' @entity85 , the @entity86 ’s associate editor and cheerleader for a @entity2 government , tweeted : ‘ agree with @entity89 on @entity90			1
if i were @entity40 , @entity29 or @entity14 , i ’d want to set the record straight			2
’ ' they ’re among the first to jump down anyone else ’s throats if anyone challenges their politically - correct shibboleths ' @entity98 , conservative mp the @entity18 has revealed how , before they became @entity99 , the three were leading officials in the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) which granted ‘ affiliate ’ status to @entity23 and built close links with it			1
the group of predatory paedophiles was calling for the age of consent to be cut to just four			1
the @entity26 itself lobbied @entity70 for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten – if the child ‘ understood the nature of the act ’ – and called for incest to be legalised in what one mp dubbed a ‘ @entity114 ’s charter ’			1
questions being asked : former minister @entity14 was the @entity26 general secretary from 1974 to 1983 annual report for 1975 : @entity14 published this document in april 1976 , which included a ' gay rights ' section on page ten defending the @entity23 and its members defence : ms @entity14 had described the @entity126 , which changed its name to pie that year , as ' a campaigning / counselling group for adults sexually attracted to children ' last night @entity132 mp @entity131 said : ‘ when left - wing commentators such as @entity55 and @entity38 demand answers from these three senior @entity2 politicians , you know that this is not so much a political issue between @entity139 , but one about right and wrong			1
’ fellow @entity132 mp @entity98 added : ‘ they should certainly provide an explanation and clarification as to whether they still hold these views or not			0
‘ they ’re among the first to jump down anyone else ’s throats if anyone challenges their politically - correct shibboleths			0
’ police are investigating @entity23 as part of @entity154 , launched in the wake of the @entity157 scandal			2
a source with knowledge of the inquiry says there is evidence @entity23 members were abusing children ‘ on an industrial scale ’			2
agm minutes : this page reveals how the @entity23 was represented at an @entity168 at the @entity169			2
below the list of organisations present is @entity29 's name , after he was re-elected to the executive committee of the @entity26 in 1977 columnists : @entity38 ( left ) in the @entity2 - supporting @entity39 angrily demanded that @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity29 speak up about why they supported the paedophile agenda in the 1970s			1
and @entity177 ( right ) , writing in the @entity178 , criticised the @entity32 for its silence on the story ' how can they ever again be taken seriously on any issue if they stay silent ? ' @entity38 , @entity39 ' who would want their own good name indelibly attached to something like this ? ' @entity188 , @entity49 ' can you imagine how the media – and especially the @entity32 – would react if three current senior conservative mps were revealed to have had links to a paedophile group ? ' @entity177 , @entity178 ' if i were @entity40 , @entity29 or @entity14 , i ’d want to set the record straight ' @entity85 , @entity86 the @entity18 has repeatedly asked the @entity2 trio to answer vital questions about their time at the @entity26			1
the @entity18 has posed a series of vital questions to @entity11 , @entity14 and @entity29			1
they include : to @entity40 , @entity14 and @entity201 : during your time with the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) , it gave significant support to the @entity23 ( @entity23 )			1
do you regret this support or feel inclined to apologise to the many victims who suffered appalling abuse at the hands of this vile organisation you helped legitimise ? to @entity14 and @entity211 : the @entity26 granted formal ‘ affiliate ’ status to @entity23			1
why did you allow your organisation to be associated with an outfit that advocated the legalisation of paedophilia ? @entity23 submitted a report to mps claiming that ‘ girls as young as four months can achieve orgasm ’ , and that four - year - old children can ‘ communicate verbally their consent to sex ’			1
given these utterly repellent views , why did you let the organisation remain affiliated to your @entity26 ? the @entity26 made a written submission to @entity70 ’s @entity229 , arguing : ‘ childhood sexual experiences , willingly engaged in , with an adult result in no identifiable damage			0
’ on what basis , scientific or otherwise , did you make this extraordinary claim ? the submission also called for the crime of incest be abolished , arguing that the suggestion that genetic damage may result from children born of incestuous unions ‘ is in direct contradiction to the practices of successful animal breeders ’			0
do you still take this view ? to @entity40 : the @entity26 ’s affiliation with @entity23 , its support for lowering ( or even abolishing ) the age of consent , and its demand for the legalisation of incest were all widely reported throughout the 1970s			1
why , given these morally offensive views , did you then take a job as legal adviser to the @entity26 ? miss @entity14 , the former health secretary , was its general secretary from 1974 - 83			2
she described @entity23 in glowing terms as ‘ a campaigning / counselling group for adults attracted to children ’			1
@entity30 ’s home affairs spokesman , mr @entity29 , sat on the @entity26 executive committee for almost a decade , from 1970 - 79			0
his wife @entity40 was a newly qualified solicitor when she became the @entity26 ’s legal officer in 1978 until 1982			0
none of the three has commented on the @entity18 ’s revelations , except for @entity40 whose spokesman said : ‘ this story is untrue and ridiculous			0
’ in the newspapers , commentators from @entity270 and @entity139 condemned the trio for failing to explain their actions			0
observer columnist @entity188 wrote : ‘ the fact remains that some very disturbing things went down , including the legitimising of a group that was n’t even bothering to hide the word “ paedophile ” in its name			0
‘ who would want their own good name indelibly attached to something like this , especially without sufficient reply ? a calm , thorough , intelligent response is required			0
’ miss @entity38 wrote : ‘ there ’s never been a time when it ’s been ok for adults to have sex with children … if any opposition politician was implicated in such a scandal , @entity40 and @entity14 would be on their moral high horses demanding explanations			0
‘ but they and @entity29 have point - blank refused to explain their links with this wicked group			0
that silence has made them look weak and cowardly			0
’ and @entity177 , writing in the @entity178 , criticised the @entity32 for its silence on the story			0
he wrote : ‘ so far , only a handful of newspapers have reported the fact that three very senior @entity2 figures had rather close links with the group back in the good ol ’ @entity317			0
‘ can you imagine how the media – and especially the @entity32 – would react if three current senior conservative mps were revealed to have had links to a paedophile group ? ’ last night a @entity32 spokesman said : ‘ @entity324 is an impartial , independent news organisation and decides its editorial priorities based on merit alone and without external help			0
‘ the story in question is not new and instead we have followed several big breaking news stories this weekend			0

pressure mounts on @entity11 , her mp husband and @entity14
@entity336 held key roles in group that backed @entity23
columnists in @entity49 , @entity56 and @entity39 urge all three to speak out
they were leading officials in group that granted ' affiliate ' status to @entity23
predatory paedophiles in @entity23 wanted the age of consent to be cut to four
