a drug dealer caught with a huge block of cannabis when he was in a serious car crash is in line for a multi-million pound payout			1
the @entity6 had been trying to stop @entity7 profiting from the injuries he suffered in the smash			2
but yesterday a judge ruled this would have breached @entity13 directives and the 40 - year - old father of five should receive compensation despite the ‘ public revulsion ’			1
@entity18 was a passenger in a speeding £ 80,000 @entity20 roadster driven by a fellow drug dealer who overtook on a bend and ploughed into a car carrying a family			1
ruling : a judge at the @entity26 said @entity18 is entitled to compensation @entity28 and @entity29 and their three children all suffered serious injuries as well but were awarded only £ 20,000 between them			1
in the judgment at the @entity26 in @entity35 , mr justice @entity33 said : ‘ many readers may be wondering how it comes about that a drug dealer is entitled to compensation against @entity40 in circumstances where he was injured during the course of a criminal joint enterprise			2
‘ the understandable reaction might be : there must be some rule of public policy , reflecting public revulsion , which bars such a claim			0
the short answer is that there is not			0
’ @entity18 , from @entity52 , @entity53 , suffered fractures , ruptured organs , amnesia and ‘ intellectual blunting ’ in the november 2006 crash near @entity59			1
mr @entity33 said : ' readers might think : there must be a rule reflecting public revulsion which bars such a claim			0
there is not ' when he and the driver , @entity69 , were cut free from the wreckage , a small package of cannabis was found hidden in @entity69 ’s sock and a block the size of a football in @entity18 ’s bomber jacket			1
@entity69 was jailed for ten months for dangerous driving and possessing cannabis			0
no action was taken against @entity18 , probably because of the severity of his injuries			2
he demanded compensation from @entity69 ’s insurers but they invoked an exclusion clause in that @entity69 was under the influence of cannabis and driving dangerously			1
@entity18 ’s lawyers sued the secretary of state for transport , claiming the exclusion under a clause of the @entity93 @entity92 ’ agreement was incompatible with the 2009 @entity95 which , in the interests of standardisation , allows no exclusions			1
the 1999 agreement helps innocent victims of uninsured drivers obtain compensation			0
in 2011 the @entity103 found against @entity18 saying he would , or should , have known the @entity20 was being used for ‘ the furtherance of crime ’			1
but yesterday mr @entity33 ruled in his favour , saying the @entity6 ’s failure to ensure uniformity between @entity93 law and the @entity13 directives was ‘ so serious that ... it must pay compensation to mr @entity7 ’			1
the court found the illegality involved in the journey itself was merely ‘ scene setting ’ and not the cause of the accident			1
but @entity18 ’s @entity122 mp @entity121 said : ‘ i ’m sure i speak for the majority of my constituents who would be horrified that a drug dealer is getting extremely large amounts of taxpayers ’ money for what is essentially a self - inflicted injury			1
’ @entity133 , the eurosceptic @entity122 mp for @entity134 and @entity135 , said it was absurd ‘ criminals can sue the government at huge taxpayers ’ expense for harm suffered in the course of committing their crimes ’			2
he said it added ‘ insult to injury that this nonsense is being forced on us by @entity151 contrary to all notions of basic democratic accountability ’			0
accident : @entity18 was being driven in a ' flashy ' @entity155 500 ( left , posed by model ) when it crashed			1
on rescuing him , emergency services found 240 grams of cannabis ( right , file photo ) the amount of compensation the @entity6 must now pay @entity18 will be assessed at a later date , but millions are routinely awarded in cases of such serious injury			1
the @entity168 family , from @entity169 , near @entity52 , were hospitalised after the crash with broken bones , collapsed lungs and bruised kidneys			0
yesterday mr @entity174 said he was surprised by the judgment			0
‘ if @entity18 is getting multi millions then it is quite disappointing when we did n’t get anything near that , ’ said the salesman			2
‘ it seems stupid that the loophole is allowed to exist and the @entity13 law allows him to get that money			2
’ the family received a new car on top of their compensation , which came from a pot built up by the @entity192 under the uninsured drivers agreement			2
when approached at his semi-detached home , @entity18 claimed he had not heard about his court victory			0
‘ all i can say is i ’m in shock , ’ he said			0
‘ i have n’t been able to work for eight years because apparently i ’ve got a brain injury			0
i do n’t feel like there ’s anything wrong but apparently there is			0
’ a @entity202 spokesman said : ‘ we thought that the directive was drafted in a wide - enough way to allow governments some autonomy			0
we are considering an appeal			0

@entity7 , 40 , was passenger in ' flashy ' @entity20 when it crashed
he ruptured organs and was left in a coma in 2006 accident
but as rescuers cut him free they found 240g block of cannabis
@entity18 , who now needs care , later tried to sue the car *'s* uninsured driver
insurers *dodged* claim *due* to clause excluding *vehicles* involved in crime
but @entity26 today ruled that clause is in breach of @entity13 laws
as a result the government must pick up the tab - expected to be millions
