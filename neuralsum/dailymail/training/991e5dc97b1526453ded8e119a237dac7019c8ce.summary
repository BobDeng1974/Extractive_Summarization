it happens once ( you hope )			2
the holiday to beat all others			2
naturally , i left my fiancé , @entity6 , to take the honeymoon helm			1
and it was n't until we arrived at @entity11 that the itinerary of a @entity14 safari and @entity15 was revealed			1
what a husband ! sipping champagne on the deck of our tent at @entity24 , transfixed by a giraffe gliding across the waves of red , green and ochre plain below , the months of nagging @entity6 about booking vaccinations and checking luggage were almost forgotten			2
a job well done , sir : @entity30 with her new husband and travel planner extraordinaire , @entity6 a note to grooms - to - be : a weight allowance and ' beach clothes plus a cover - up ' is not sufficient packing guidance for even the most low - maintenance fiancée			1
nor , as it turned out , was it accurate for a safari			2
but despite being dressed in almost every item in my 15kg bag the next morning , i still could n't do anything but grin			2
it was all too perfect			0
@entity50 is a beautiful ten - tent camp on the 200 sq km @entity52 , bordering the @entity53			1
land is rented from the local @entity55 , creating a partnership between traditions and tourism			0
@entity50 is fully involved in local life - from dispatching the tractor to help nearby villages to supporting the @entity62 , which trains @entity55 and counted our guide @entity63 among its alumni			1
our first game drive was stupendous			0
my heart thudded as a male lion strutted a metre from us			0
it was quiet , save for the click of my camera as an elephant padded silently , with a grace unbefitting his size			0
and we were so absorbed watching the red sun rise over the hills and spill its fiery morning light across the plains that the camera did n't even get a look in			0
we were there for the great migration , voted by @entity87 as one of the @entity89			0
around july and august , conveniently timed for summer honeymoons , 1.5million wildebeest , 350,000 @entity93 's gazelles and 200,000 zebras cross the @entity95 from the @entity96 into @entity14			1
it 's rush hour on the savannah			0
our final evening 's drive ( night drives are banned in the @entity95 and you have to keep to the tracks ) finished with a surprise dinner on a rocky promontory in the middle of the wilderness			1
a little patch of paradise : @entity15 is blessed with white - sand beaches and splendid hotels camp fire at our feet , gin to our lips and a blanket of stars over our heads , we were sold on safaris			1
then we left @entity50 and headed to its equally attractive sister hotel in @entity122			1
opened last year , @entity122 offers the perfect rest after bone - rattling dawn drives			1
you can even check in for just the afternoon between flights to stretch your legs on the manicured lawns , take a massage or do laps of the pool			0
rested and ready for our next adventure , we caught a flight from @entity122 to @entity15			1
this exotic island has been attracting visitors for centuries			1
@entity139 merchants , @entity141 explorers and @entity143 tradesmen were brought by monsoon winds , seduced by spices , bazaars , or , shamefully , the slave trade			0
this painful memory is addressed at the @entity149 in @entity150			0
built on the site of the old slave market , the altar poignantly stands where once was the whipping post			0
an hour 's drive from @entity150 , on the east coast is the six - villa @entity159 hotel , part of the @entity161			1
everything is beautiful , from the hand - carved woodwork and culinary masterpieces leaving the kitchen , to the staff 's welcoming smiles and views across the @entity169 , which changes colour with every sip of your sundowner			1
even we - cynics of anything involving hearts and rose petals - could n't help being swept up by how romantic the resort is			1
by the end of the first day we were strolling on the beach hand in hand , drunk on the cornflour soft sand and electric sea			1
we were helped by the charming manager @entity185			0
he took joy in finding every opportunity to surprise us , from surreptitiously running a candle - lit bath to secretly setting up our lunch under a palm canopy on the beach			1
honeymoon cliche we may have become , but deserted beaches these are not			1
this island paradise comes with a backbone and life zinging through the sand			1
our beach lunch was happily disturbed by migrating cattle and fishermen cycling past			2
at low tide , we walked out to the reef , passing locals searching the bath - warm water for sea snails			2
roar power : @entity30 and @entity6 spent happy days amid the wildlife of @entity14 's @entity95 further down the beach is the village of @entity214 , where the hotel group has built a maternity clinic and a mosque for the locals			1
the sand here is covered with half - buried tyres			2
not litter , but each one marking where a coconut has been buried to soften and make into rope			0
family - run , the @entity161 has three , soon to be four , exquisite properties along the same stretch of coast			2
the location was chosen by the owner 's father , based on an old @entity234 map showing a well			0
it was never found , but this did n't stop the family from forging ahead			0
its other hotels , breezes and @entity242 , sit next door to @entity159 , and each reflects a different part of @entity15 's history			1
@entity159 is inspired by the @entity248 heritage ; @entity249 has a @entity141 feel ; while the 30 - villa @entity242 , with its huge pool and serene courtyards , nods to the @entity139 past			2
palms guests can enjoy the sister hotels , too			0
breezes has a diving school and offers private dinners fit for sultans			0
when we decided to prepare ourselves for the return to a life less horizontal , we joined a snorkelling safari and worked off lunch at @entity242 's tennis courts			0
@entity6 had done well , seriously well			0
i 'm normally in charge of travel arrangements , but on our return i made a decision			0
i gave him the travel trousers - for him to have and to hold , from this day forward , till death us do part			2
@entity275 ( 01494 678 400 , www.turquoiseholidays.co.uk ) offers two weeks in @entity276 from £ 3,475 per person			0
