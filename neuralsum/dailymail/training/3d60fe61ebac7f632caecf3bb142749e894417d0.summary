@entity8 star @entity23 says the @entity2 should play more games outside of @entity6 @entity7 , who scored 17 points in that victory nearly two years ago , is excited about returning to @entity27 but admits a regular recurrence of a trip across the @entity30 with the @entity8 depends on commissioner @entity32 ’s decision			1
‘ i wish we could play in @entity17 every single season but again it ’s up to the commissioner to come up with that but i do truly enjoy playing in @entity17 for sure , ’ he said at a teleconference ahead of friday ’s release of tickets for january ’s clash			1

on tuesday it was announced that a record 101 international players from 37 countries will be competing in the league this season too - including @entity78 's @entity77 at the @entity56			1
with this devotion to expanding the game , there have been suggestions that the sport could follow the example of @entity85 and look at the possibilities of having a franchise outside of @entity6 – something @entity7 believes is n’t impossible			2
‘ i ’m sure the commissioners would take a look at that and see how the fans appreciate the game of basketball there and if it continues to grow then i ’m sure that the commissioner will would keep a close eye on that			0
hopefully if it continues to grow then we ’ll see what happens , ’ he added			0

back fit the 31 - year - old hopes for a better outcome for himself and his team this campaign despite a tough looking fixture list to begin with as they host the @entity123 and the @entity124 next			2
‘ my personal goal is to get back to the @entity7 that the world fell in love with			2
the basketball player that i was able to become as a youth and to continue to improve as a player – i want to get back to my dominant self , ’ he said			0
@entity7 ( left ) played 24 minutes in the @entity8 ' 95 - 90 victory against the @entity55 on thursday ‘ there are a lot of individual goals of mine but as a team we are looking to succeed as well			1
with the combination of both of those attributes i think we should be a pretty successful team			0
‘ we ca n’t dwell on the past			0
we do n’t forget it but we do keep it in the back of our mind knowing that we do n’t want to repeat that so that fuels us to continue to train harder			0
‘ we ’ve definitely got to try and get a few wins out of that [ opening ] schedule right there			0
it ’s a tough stretch – all four of those teams are playing well but for us i think we ’re still trying to get our identity figured out in terms of offence but i think if we continue to work the way we are then we ’ll be ok			0
