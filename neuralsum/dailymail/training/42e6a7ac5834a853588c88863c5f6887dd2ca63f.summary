by @entity0 published : 19:22 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 05:59 est , 23 may 2013 elected police commissioners have sparked a cronyism row by packing their offices with taxpayer - funded political appointees			1
a string of them have appointed former campaign aides , party colleagues and local councillors to highly - paid deputy posts in their expanding offices , a report revealed			2
mps found that the commissioners , who are paid up to £ 100,000 a year to supervise local police forces , were hiring dozens of officials to work with them , on salaries of up to £ 70,000			1
former mp @entity18 , who heads the @entity20 force , has appointed 45 members of staff , including two communications officers and a head of ' scrutiny and engagement ' once the cost of their offices are totalled up , 14 @entity29 – or one in three of the total – are already costing more than the @entity33 they replaced , the @entity28 home affairs committee said			1
one police and @entity35 , former mp @entity18 who heads the @entity20 force , has appointed 45 members of staff , including two communications officers and a head of ‘ scrutiny and engagement ’			2
critics said the @entity42 were guilty of ‘ building cosy little empires ’			1
@entity45 , chief executive of @entity46 ’ @entity44 , said : ‘ @entity47 were elected to keep a watchful eye on police spending , not to build their own cosy little empires			1
‘ taxpayers elected their @entity29 – and not all of their political friends – precisely because they wanted to see someone crack down on wasteful spending and unnecessary bureaucracy in the police			1
’ pccs are barred from appointing party political office holders and ‘ active party members ’ to their staff , with the exception of the position of deputy @entity42			1
all other roles should be ‘ appointed on merit ’ , the rules say			0
however , the report notes that ‘ the position of deputy is not a politically restricted post			0
some @entity29 have consequently recruited political or personal contacts ’			1
they include @entity74 pcc @entity73 , who appointed three interim assistant commissioners on £ 65,000 , including two from his campaign team			2
@entity80 pcc @entity78 hired three @entity82 councillors as assistant commissioners on £ 22,500 and a deputy commissioner , @entity85 , on £ 65,000			2
@entity88 pcc @entity86 hired her @entity90 former campaign manager @entity89 as an adviser on £ 70,000 , while @entity93 pcc @entity92 , a former metropolitan police officer , hired a former colleague , @entity94 , as his deputy on £ 50,000			2
a separate @entity97 survey revealed @entity98 had created nearly 450 posts in their offices since the november elections			0
behind @entity20 , the @entity42 has hired 27 staff , @entity103 26 and @entity80 23			1
the committee called for a national register of @entity107 ’ interests and for ‘ stronger scrutiny ’ of the commissioners to prevent ‘ maverick decision making ’			0
they found that only one in four has published their full spending information online – such as expenses and contacts – despite the law requiring them to do so			0
chief executive of the @entity119 's office @entity117 said : ' the staff in @entity18 ’s office were transferred over from the police authority			0
' as highlighted in the @entity125 report , the cost of running @entity18 ’s office is significantly less than other police and crime commissioners			1
' this represents a saving of 8.5 % on the costs of the former police authority and the commissioner is looking to identify further savings			0
' @entity88 pcc @entity86 hired her @entity90 former campaign manager @entity89 as an adviser on £ 70,000 a @entity42 whose staff were arrested after he reported them for allegedly exposing his expenses claim for a chauffeur - driven @entity141 has been criticised by @entity143			2
@entity144 and crime commissioner @entity145 reported the whistleblowers for telling a local newspaper that he had charged the taxpayer £ 700 for two chauffeur - driven trips			0
he later apologised but said he had no regrets about calling the police			0
three people have been arrested and could face jail if convicted over the leaks			0
mps on the committee said : ‘ where pccs are considered to have exceeded their powers or otherwise behaved inappropriately , it is unacceptable that those who expose the matter should be at risk of losing their jobs , or face other reprisals			0
