@entity0 thought he had done ok as he walked off the @entity2 pitch at half - time during @entity6 ’s @entity5 tie against @entity7 last month			1
steady , nothing special , but he felt invigorated all the same			0
the score was 1 - 1 and @entity0 , returning to the team for the first time since @entity6 ’s defeat at @entity13 in february , had kept @entity7 flyer @entity15 reasonably quiet			1
@entity0 was growing into that famous red shirt , getting stronger down the left flank as this fiery sixth - round tie against @entity21 ’s team wore on			2
@entity0 thought he had done ok against @entity7 in the @entity5 but he was substituted at half time @entity23 substituted the £ 28million defender , telling @entity0 that he was not fit enough to play for @entity6 @entity0 has not played since and was withdrawn from the recent @entity26 squad as he struggles at @entity6 @entity0 's stats for the season show how he has struggled to hold down a regular place at left back with @entity6 what happened next will ultimately shape his career as a @entity6 player			1
@entity23 substituted the £ 28million defender , telling @entity0 that he was not fit enough to play for @entity6 , and replaced him with @entity34 for the second half			1
@entity7 went on to win 2 - 1 and getting dragged off at half - time was another blow to @entity0 ’s fragile self - esteem			1
he has not played since , withdrawn by @entity39 from the @entity26 squad for games against @entity42 and @entity43 because of question marks over his fitness			0
his position at @entity6 has been taken by @entity47 , shuffled across from the centre of midfield as @entity6 went on a winning run against @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			2
@entity0 is struggling to come to terms with his new life , turning to @entity6 ’s psychologist to declutter his mind and reboot just nine months into his career at @entity2			1
@entity0 is struggling to come to terms with his new life and has turned to @entity6 's psychologist of late @entity0 had kept @entity15 reasonably quiet in the @entity5 clash but @entity39 was unimpressed there are serious concerns , particularly because his parents have spoken to the club about a lack of structure and support for their teenage son			1
they have every right to do so			0
cash is king in football and we sometimes forget to look beyond the £ 28m fee @entity6 paid @entity74 ( £ 15m up front ) and a five - year contract worth an eye - watering £ 90,000 a week			1
@entity0 was 19 in july , returning from @entity26 ’s disastrous @entity78 in @entity79 , where he started the final group game against @entity81 , to meet up with his new @entity6 team - mates			1
initially he lived in the @entity83 , joined by his parents as he began a period of adaptation in a new city			0
he has since moved into a house in the suburbs			0
earlier this week he hinted at some of the difficulties he has faced , awarding himself a c minus for his first season during an interview with @entity94			0
at @entity6 , @entity0 has found a manager in @entity39 who has very specific and exacting demands of his players @entity39 has led @entity6 up the table and they crowned the recent good form with a win over @entity54 he was assigned a dietitian and given nutritional advice as he adjusted to life as the most expensive teenage footballer in the history of the game			1
at @entity74 he had been ordered to eschew the glasses of cola and sticky food , told to mature into his physique as he grew into a man ’s body			0
he needs discipline and constant , caring reminders from the coaches			0
those close to him explain that @entity0 needs pastoral advice , that he responds positively when he feels close to the coaches and playing staff			2
at the age of 16 , when @entity121 made an official offer for @entity0 in his breakthrough season at @entity74 , his head was so scrambled by the prospect of joining his boyhood team that he had to be taken out of the @entity74 line - up			2
in the dog - eat - dog world of @entity6 , where it is a constant fight for survival after last season ’s disappointing finish , he has yet to establish those strong bonds			2
last season he often spent time in @entity134 ’s office after training , sitting with the former @entity74 manager as they discussed different areas of their lives			2
@entity134 spent a lot of time with @entity0 to help make him feel at home at @entity74 last season @entity134 teased the best out of a player who went on to make his @entity26 debut at the age of 18 the club worked out that he was travelling back to his parents ’ home near @entity152 , @entity153 , by monitoring his @entity155 account and looking at the times he posted messages on social media			1
with @entity134 there was a real , almost paternal warmth to their relationship as the manager teased the best out of a player who went on to make his @entity26 debut at the age of 18			0
to put @entity0 ’s extraordinary rise into perspective , @entity168 , perhaps @entity26 ’s classiest and finest left back , had to wait until he was 20 to make his debut for the national team			1
@entity0 ’s life has changed , moving away from the bosom of his family in @entity153 for the demands and challenges at a club where the spotlight is intense			1
he is a sensitive young man			0
it had been hoped that @entity39 would show some patience with @entity0 when his appointment at @entity6 was confirmed , particularly after his @entity182 success at @entity183 in 1995			1
@entity184 ( 22 ) , @entity185 ( 22 ) and @entity186 ( 19 ) all started the 1 - 0 victory over @entity188 in the final in @entity190 , with striker @entity191 ( 18 ) named on the bench			0
@entity39 's @entity182 success at @entity183 in 1995 saw him include young players in his starting xi at the @entity196 with @entity197 , @entity39 had notable success with 20 - year - old @entity199 more recently , at the @entity196 with @entity197 , @entity39 had notable success with 20 - year - old @entity199 , who was named on the three - man shortlist for the best young player at the tournament			0
but what @entity0 found at @entity6 was a manager who has very specific and exacting demands			1
before @entity39 conceded defeat and reverted to a back four , @entity0 had been playing in the unfamiliar role of wing back			2
the transition has many similar characteristics to @entity213 ’s first couple of seasons with @entity51			0
both are real home boys			0
@entity0 's position at @entity6 has been taken by @entity47 , shuffled across from the centre of midfield the former @entity74 man is learning to deal with the attention at one of the biggest football clubs around @entity0 longs for the days when he could stay behind after training with @entity134 , where the @entity224 coach would team up with one of the other young players for a light - hearted game of head tennis			1
it was at @entity74 , under the guidance of @entity134 and the former executive chairman @entity232 , where @entity0 ’s career flourished			0
the well - being of the boy was top priority			0
he is a @entity6 player now , learning to deal with the attention at one of the biggest football clubs in the world			2
at such a young age , he needs all the help he can get .			0

@entity6 paid almost £ *30million* to sign @entity0 last *summer*
deal made @entity0 the most expensive teenage footballer of all time
he has not appeared for @entity6 since being substituted against @entity7
@entity23 has told the young left back he is not fit enough
@entity0 is a home boy and has struggled to adapt to new life in @entity253
he has found a manager who has very specific and exacting demands
