in recent years , @entity1 ’s sister told her that her birth mother had turned to the courts to try to keep her			1

‘ when i was given my birth weight and other basic details , i could n’t believe it			0

‘ when i heard “ publicly ” , i was really confused , so myself and my partner googled “ @entity60 ” and “ @entity61 ” , and up came this story about @entity0			2
i knew it had to be him			0
i made contact immediately and we talked for hours			0

‘ she ’s very like me in many ways			0
i could hear her personality and we are very similar			0
you never know how these things will go but this went really well			0
’ ‘ we were in the same crowd , we knew the same people , it ’s crazy to think that , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ imagine if we ’d ended up going out with each other ? this is why people need to know who they are			0
’ his sister , who has two adult children , said : ‘ to meet @entity0 after all these years is wonderful			1
’ both were struck by the fact that they grew up in close proximity to one another			0
@entity1 , who works as an estate agent and has a son , 27 , and daughter , 22 , said : ‘ i was born in november 1965 , just 13 months after @entity0 and we would have been in @entity25 ’s at the same time			1
‘ we definitely overlapped , but we were never told			0
’ @entity1 ’s adoptive family , the @entity114 , who she is no longer in touch with after her adopted parents died when she was a teenager , moved from @entity42 to @entity29 , where @entity0 lived , in 1969			1
‘ so we were only down the road from each other , ’ she pointed out			0
‘ i went to @entity120 nightclub and @entity0 would have dj ’d there			2
we were definitely in each other ’s company			0
’ @entity0 is a radio presenter on @entity16 station @entity15			1
it was through his high media profile that @entity1 was easily able to track him down and contacted him through his email on the station 's website the pair found out about each other after being sent a letter from an adoption agency			1
@entity1 was given the name of her brother and began searching for him online and came across the @entity16 dj and got in touch she pointed out that one of @entity0 's best friends even @entity136 'd at her 21st birthday party			1
both @entity0 , a father of three , and @entity1 have met their biological mother in recent years			1

she eventually married and had a fourth child , and raised her two youngest children with her husband , who was never told of the existence of @entity0 and @entity1			1
they have considerable sympathy for their birth mother			2
@entity0 said : ‘ i feel sorry for my mother : she ’s old and does n’t remember a huge amount			1
‘ she said they [ the @entity25 ’s home mothers ] could be sent out to clean a church , and come back to find their baby gone			0
‘ she said the mothers would slip notes into their babies ’ nappies in the hope that the adoptive parents would keep them and give them to the children later			2
’ however , @entity0 says he has drawn a blank in researching his birth father			2
‘ i asked my mother , “ who is my father ? ” she was really vague , and said he worked in a church			0
i asked her was he a priest and she would n’t say			0
’ @entity1 explained that she had little interest in discovering her background until recent years			1
learning ‘ basic details ’ about her early days , such as her birth weight , made her curious			0
‘ it was , like , up until then , i was n’t even born but here i was , on paper , with another life that i did n’t know anything about			0
‘ i was 46 when i met my mother , and she was 80			2
she is a frail woman and i had no axe to grind with her			0
i was n’t there to beat her up , it was just to meet her			0
‘ i feel so sorry for those women : they were treated so badly and for her to have found us all means so much to her			0
@entity1 ( right ) with her 27 - year - old son ( centre ) and her 22 - year - old daughter ( left ) together recently ‘ i ’m delighted now that i found out			1
i feel kind of guilty that i did n’t do more before i was 46 but i just accepted the situation			0
i believed i was a lucky child because i had been adopted			0
‘ but i could have met @entity0 a lot sooner			2
