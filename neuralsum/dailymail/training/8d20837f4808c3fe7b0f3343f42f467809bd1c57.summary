by @entity0 published : 08:28 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 07:01 est , 25 january 2013 humans living 40,000 years ago in the area around @entity4 were already genetically distinct from the ancestors of modern @entity6 , dna analysis has found			1
an international team of researchers sequenced dna that had been extracted from the leg of an early modern human from @entity12 near to the @entity14 capital			2
analyses showed that the @entity12 human shared a common origin with the ancestors of many present - day @entity19 and native americans - but had already diverged genetically from ancient @entity6			1
the leg of the early modern human from @entity12 that was used for the genetic analysis : dna sequencing showed a genetic profile already distinct from that of the ancestors of @entity6 the researchers also found that the proportion of @entity30 and @entity31 in the early modern human was no higher than in the present day population of this region			1
researchers with the @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37 , took nuclear and mitochondrial dna from a 40,000 year old leg bone unearthed at the @entity12 in 2003			2
they used newly developed techniques to enable them to identify ancient genetic material from an archaeological find even when large quantities of @entity31 from soil bacteria are present			0
the researchers then reconstructed a genetic profile of the leg 's owner			0
study leader @entity50 said : ' this individual lived during an important evolutionary transition when early modern humans , who shared certain features with earlier forms such as @entity30 , were replacing @entity30 and @entity56			0
' the genetic profile revealed that this early modern human was related to the ancestors of many present - day @entity19 and native americans but had already diverged genetically from the ancestors of present - day @entity6			1
in addition , the @entity12 individual did not carry a larger proportion of @entity30 or @entity56 dna than present - day people in the region			0
study : researchers carrying out excavation works at @entity12 , where the leg bones were unearthed in 2003 ' more analyses of additional early modern humans across @entity71 will further refine our understanding of when and how modern humans spread across @entity6 and @entity19 , ' said professor @entity50			1
parts of the work were carried out in a new laboratory jointly run by the @entity78 and the @entity79 in @entity4			0
the study 's findings have been published online in the journal @entity83 .			0

@entity31 sequenced from leg bone found in cave near to @entity4
analysis showed common origin with modern @entity19 and native americans - but genetic divergence from @entity6
