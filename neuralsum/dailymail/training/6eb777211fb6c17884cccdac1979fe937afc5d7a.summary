by @entity0 startling new research has revealed just how vulnerable our planet is to asteroid impacts			1
a trio of former astronauts has announced we ’re up to ten times more likely to be hit than previously thought - and warn the only way we ’ve avoided disaster so far is through ' blind luck '			1
however , the majority of the impacts occurred either high up in the atmosphere , or in unpopulated areas including the @entity15 and @entity14			1
' however , the majority of the impacts occurred either high up in the atmosphere , or in unpopulated areas including the @entity15 and @entity14 the announcement was made at a press conference at the @entity26			1
asteroids hitting the @entity17 caused 26 nuclear - scale explosions between 2000 and 2013 , a new report has revealed			1
some were more powerful , and in one case , dozens of times stronger , than the 15 - kiloton atom bomb blast that destroyed @entity33 in 1945			0
the impacts were recorded by the @entity36 which operates a global network of sensors listening out for nuclear weapon detonations			0
most occurred too high in the atmosphere to cause any serious damage on the ground			1
but the evidence is a sobering reminder of how vulnerable the @entity17 is to the threat from space , say scientists			2
the most dramatic impact by an asteroid or comet in recent times occurred when an object exploded over @entity53 , @entity54 , in 1908 with an energy yield equivalent to between 5,000 and 15,000 tons of @entity56			2
an area of forest covering 770 square miles ( 2,000 square km ) was flattened by the blast			0
three former astronauts supporting the @entity61 - a private company devoted to protecting @entity17 from asteroids - presented the data			1
dr @entity64 , former @entity66 and @entity67 astronaut , and ceo of the @entity61 , was joined by fellow former astronauts @entity70 and @entity71 , the latter of whom flew on @entity74			1
the findings are based on information released from the @entity36			0
this operates a network of sensors that monitor @entity17 around the clock listening for the infrasound signatures of nuclear detonations			2
but what these sensors found were not nuclear explosions , but rather asteroid impacts on a huge scale			2
between 2000 and 2013 the network detected 26 explosions on @entity17 ranging in energy from one to 600 kilotons – all caused by asteroid impacts			1
by comparison , the atomic bomb that destroyed @entity33 in 1945 exploded with an energy impact of 15 kilotons , which was enough to level the city and kill around 80,000 people			0
in the video the @entity61 points out 26 explosions all over the world in the last 13 years that are thought to be the result of asteroid impacts ranging in size from one to 600 kilotons dr @entity64 , pictured , is a former @entity106 astronaut who flew on the @entity107 , @entity67 and @entity108			1
he is now the ceo of @entity61 and works alongside other former astronauts the explosions detected on @entity17 , believed to have been caused by asteroids , were up to 40 times as powerful as the nuclear bomb that devastated @entity33 in 1945 , pictured the discovery signifies a ten-fold increase on the number of large asteroids that were previously thought to strike @entity17 , and the astronauts claim @entity17 is incredibly lucky to have avoided a major disaster occurring so far			1
dr @entity64 said ‘ most large asteroids with the potential to destroy an entire country or continent have been detected			0
’ but , he went on to say , ‘ less than 10,000 of the more than a million dangerous asteroids with the potential to destroy an entire major metropolitan area have been found by all existing space or terrestrially - operated observatories			0
‘ because we do n’t know where or when the next major impact will occur , the only thing preventing a catastrophe from a " city - killer " sized asteroid has been blind luck			0
’ despite the majority of impacts occurring in water and high up in the atmosphere , a number have taken place on land			1
for example , the @entity146 meteorite , contrail pictured , flew above the @entity150 city in 2013			0
the impact injured hundreds of people and served as a reminder of how deadly incoming space rocks can be this map shows the locations where asteroids have hit the planet from 3.5 million years ago up to 2013 the solution , according to the @entity61 , is to build an early warning infrared space telescope for tracking asteroids			1
this would come in the form of their @entity164 , which would let experts track potentially deadly asteroids many years in advance , when they are still millions of miles away			2
this would be the world ’s first privately - funded deep space mission to create the first comprehensive dynamic map of our inner solar system			0
with a planned launch in 2018 , it would identify the current and future locations and trajectories of asteroids that cross @entity17 ’s orbit			1
it is hoped the satellite would detect more than 200,000 asteroids in the first year of its operation			2
it would be capable of finding so many thanks to its unique orbit away from @entity17 , which would scan the area around @entity17 ’s orbit			0
and , the team hopes , it would be capable of finding and tracking asteroids that pose the greatest threat to life on @entity17			2
this would be the most capable near - @entity17 orbit ( @entity198 ) detection system in operation			0
it would be located in a @entity203 - like orbit but pointed towards the orbital plane of @entity17 , completing a trip around the sun every seven months			0
@entity207 pointing accuracy to sub-pixel resolution would allow images to be studied in detail			0
it is designed for highly autonomous , reliable operation requiring only weekly ground contact and could perform surveying operations for around 6.5 years			0
the highly specialised design is specifically optimised for @entity198 detection and discovery			0
@entity164 is expected to discover approximately 500,000 @entity219 by 2024 , which will account for 98 per cent of all @entity219 known to humanity			1
but the team states that if an asteroid is on a collision course with @entity17 the mission only has a 30 per cent chance of finding it			0
if one is found , the @entity61 said : ' it is our belief that the people of the world will then unite in carrying out a deflection of that asteroid to prevent this future impact			2
' @entity164 satellite , pictured , is planned to launch in 2018			1
the team says that by 2024 it will find up to 500,000 asteroids , which would account for 98 % of all near - @entity17 asteroids known to humanity @entity164 satellite would operate in an almost identical orbit to another proposed mission called the @entity244			1
the orbit and field of view of the satellites are shown in this illustration			0

new research has revealed asteroids hit @entity17 more often than first thought
announcement was made by former astronauts at the @entity61
from 2000 to 2013 former astronauts studied explosion data on @entity17
they found 26 instances were likely caused by asteroids exploding high up in the atmosphere
this makes impacts up to ten times more common than *original* estimates
however , the majority of the impacts occurred in unpopulated areas including the @entity15 and @entity14 oceans
researchers have proposed a satellite to detect asteroids before they hit
@entity164 satellite would launch in 2018 and would find 500,000 by 2024
