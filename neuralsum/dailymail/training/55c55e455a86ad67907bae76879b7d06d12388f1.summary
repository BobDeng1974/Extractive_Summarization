by @entity0 a father today told how he has travelled 40,000 miles just to hug his severely autistic son , who is cared for at a specialist centre 250 miles from home			1
when @entity7 was diagnosed with severe autism , his parent 's lives changed forever			1
born in october 2000 , the now 13 - year - old was healthy and appeared to walk , talk and develop as any other toddler			0
but when he reached two - and - a - half , his parents @entity12 and @entity13 started to notice something was n't quite right			1
@entity15 stopped speaking , he started to show signs of repetitive behaviour , began to bang his head against walls and started screaming			2
@entity7 , 13 , was diagnosed with severe autism when he was two - and - a - half			1
for years his parents cared for him at their homes , but when his self - harming became more extreme he was referred to a specialist treatment centre in @entity24 , 250 miles from his @entity26 home @entity12 and @entity13 have travelled the 500 - mile round trip to see their son for the last 20 months , but are now desperate to bring him home today the teenager is receiving the specialist care he needs			1
but it means he is separated from his parents by 250 miles , living at a treatment centre in @entity24 while his family live in @entity26			1
the couple , who have separated , told this morning they take it in turns to make the 500 - mile round trip to visit @entity15 as often as they can			1
on a good day the journey takes between five and six hours			0
in the last 20 months his father said he has travelled around 40,000 miles just to hug his son			1
mr @entity13 said : ' we have n't tucked him in bed for 19 months now , or kissed him goodnight or read him a story			1
in a heartbreaking post on the family 's petition page to bring him home , he wrote : ' @entity15 has now spent both his 12th and his 13th birthdays in the unit , 260 miles away from me and the rest of his family in @entity26			1
he has never met his little sister			2
' this whole experience is heartbreaking for our family			0
@entity15 continually asks for us and when he ca n’t see us he becomes anxious and more likely to self injure			2
' [ his ] self - harming is so severe that it is life threatening			1
last year he bit his tongue so badly that a third of it then had to be removed			0
' we visit @entity15 every weekend			1
this is exhausting but it still never feels enough			0
while the staff caring for @entity15 do a great job , what we ca n’t understand is why @entity15 ca n’t receive that same level of care , closer to home , so we do n’t have to travel for over five hours just to give him a hug			1
' it was when ms @entity12 was at an autism awareness day that a light blub went off in her head , her son was autistic			1
shortly after that , @entity15 was formally diagnosed with severe autism			1
his condition was a regressive form of the disorder , which comes on as a child grows up			0
ms @entity12 said : ' he developed fine , but he started to decline , his autism is regressive			2
@entity15 's parents have pleaded with their local @entity88 authority in @entity26 to bring their son home after travelling backwards and forwards to @entity24 for nearly two years ' his speech stopped and we started to see lots of repetitive behaviour , lots of head banging			1
' i was n't overly concerned until i went to an autism awareness day and a light bulb went off in my head , he 's got autism			0
' he was diagnosed quickly because he showed all the typical traits			0
' the quick diagnosis did help me accept it quicker , you do n't want to label your child but because the support and research was there i could do what i could to help him			0
' but for @entity15 's father @entity13 the diagnosis was harder to come to terms with			1
he said : ' i was a typical man about it , i put my head in the sand , i thought " my boy ? what ? "			0
' but i do n't think it took me that long to get my head around it			0
' @entity120 told this morning : ' we understand how upsetting this is for @entity15 and his family			1
' @entity15 is the only child with autism or a learning disability that @entity120 has placed out of the county , one of the lowest rates in the country			1
' we will always try to commission bespoke care , but @entity15 's complex needs means he does need specialist care that we are currently unable to provide in @entity26			1
' we have appointed a learning disabilities nurse to work with the family and our plan is to bring @entity15 back to @entity26 as soon as we can to find a way to provide him the best possible care closer to home			1
' the pair said they went through a ' grieving process ' for the ' boy they lost '			0
ms @entity12 said : ' everyone who has a child hopes they will become a footballer , or be good at this or that			2
' but those hopes and dreams die a little bit			0
' you worry about if they will ever be independent , what if something happens to me ? who will care for them ? ' i think that is the biggest worry for a parent , who has a child with a disability , what happens if you go ? ' ms @entity12 added : ' it is something you never expect			2
but we got through the rough times , there were periods of self - harm that were quite extreme			0
' we helped @entity15 feel secure and safe and the phase would pass until the next time			2
' as he got older it became more apparent it was increasing , his self - harm was getting more extreme and it was becoming harder to keep him safe			0
' when you have other children to look after as well it only takes turning away for a second and if he was in a bad place his head would be on the wall			0
' the hardest thing was knowing that perhaps there was going to come a point where we could not keep him safe anymore and he needed more than we could give him			0
' mr @entity13 said : ' the specific services that @entity15 needs were not in place in @entity26			1
he was in hospital in @entity194 for three months then he was transferrred to @entity24			2
' initially we were told for 12 weeks , then it became six months			0
' now here we are 20 months later			1
we kept asking for help , kept asking them to look into what 's missing in @entity26 , what can be put in place that can bring @entity15 back to us ? to both our families			1
' ms @entity12 added : ' we always assumed he would come back , we did n't really agree with him going away in the first place but we sort of had little choice , no one was coping even the staff working with @entity15			1
the pair , who have separated since their son was diagnosed with severe autism , estimated they have travelled 80,000 miles between them			1
mr @entity13 said for the last 19 months they have not been able to kiss @entity216 , adding the 12 - year - old has not met his younger sister @entity218 the couple have worked alongside the charity @entity220 and the @entity222 , to lobby the government to ensure people with a learning disability can get the support they need in their local communities			1
they launched a petition @entity229 which has more than 175,000 signatures			2
in a joint statement , @entity232 , chief executive of @entity220 , and @entity234 , chief executive of the @entity222 , said : ' @entity15 ’s story is devastating , but sadly he is not alone			2
' we know that 185 children and young people are also in similar situations , stuck in assessment and treatment units hundreds of miles away from their loved ones			0
' we urgently need local care services which are fit for purpose			0
' the government has said that children and adults with a learning disability should not be living in units and that local areas must develop the right support and services			0
but this is not happening			0
' this awful situation for @entity15 can not be allowed to continue			2
' the money spent on sending people like @entity15 to units can be spent developing local services instead			2
' we urge everyone to sign @entity15 ’s petition and make this change happen			2
” ' but i never dreamed he would still be away now			0
@entity12 sometimes reads him a story over the phone but it is things like that			2
' ms @entity12 added : ' i live in fear every time the phone rings , that something has happened and i ca n't get there			0
' i think he is pretty traumatised , i 'm worried he will never get over this emotionally			0
he wo n't get over it physically , the damage ( from self - harm ) is to great to his face and mouth			0
' i think he needs the security of his family , he is very frightened and confused			0
' when he was younger @entity15 suffered separation anxiety			0
his parents said the now teenager would purposely hurt himself or vomit at school knowing he would be picked up and taken home			2
she added : ' he is very complex			0
we are not saying that because he is away that is the sole reason he is harming			0
' we are very , very happy with the care he is getting , they adore him ' @entity15 's father added : ' it is not easy to leave him behind on a sunday and come back to @entity26 but when he is snuggled into a specific carer , he has chosen to sit with , i take that image with me when i go home			1
' he is happy , they are part of his family , they know him			0
' @entity120 said the plan is to bring @entity15 closer to home for treatment and said they have employed a specialist nurse to liaise with the family			1
mr @entity13 added : ' it does now seem that it is a case of not if , but when @entity15 will come home			1

@entity7 was diagnosed with severe autism when he was two years old
for years his parents @entity12 and @entity13 cared for him at home
but around two years *ago* his self - harming became so severe they realised he needed specialist treatment
he was transferred to a centre in @entity24 for specific care
but 20 months later his parents are still having to do the 500 - mile round trip from their homes in @entity26 to visit @entity15 , who has never met his little sister
a petition *#* @entity330 has received *176,000* signatures
@entity120 say their plan is to bring @entity15 home but they have to ensure the specialist care is available before the teenager can be transferred
