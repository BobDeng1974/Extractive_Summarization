stressed : nurses should never have to care for more than eight patients at once , draft guidelines say nurses should never again have the ' dangerous ' task of caring for more than eight hospital patients at a time , a major report will warn the @entity8 next week			1
the guidelines - drawn up in the wake of the damning inquiry into deaths at @entity13 - could mean thousands more nurses have to be hired to save patients suffering due to a lack of staff			1
but despite warnings that they should be a bare minimum , the new measures would still be flexible depending on the needs of each hospital			2
and one nursing campaign says a one - to - eight ratio is not enough , with one - to - four the ideal target			1
the draft measures were drawn up at the government 's request by the @entity29 and @entity30 ( @entity31 )			2
the one - to - eight ratio refers to both day and night shifts but the guidelines will focus most urgently on overnight care in acute adult hospital wards , a @entity31 spokesman said			1
these are the shifts where some of the most shocking under - staffing has been revealed			1
figures obtained by the @entity41 in november showed some stressed nurses had cared for up to 22 patients each on night shifts at @entity45 and @entity46 , both part of @entity8 trust			2
at @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52 , meanwhile , there was one nurse for 21 patients and there was one for 16 patients at @entity57 , in @entity58			0
the draft report is due to be released on monday , 194 years to the day after the birth of @entity61			1
a @entity31 spokesman said : ' it recognises that if each registered nurse is caring for more than eight patients regularly during the day , there is an increased risk of harm			0
' lead nurses on wards will be told to watch out for ' red flag events ' , which include patients not being given medicine , asked about their pain or helped to the bathroom - and a single one should indicate the ward needs more staff			0
that system would be used instead of the government ordering compulsory numbers or targets , which @entity31 warned could become a maximum rather than a minimum on which to improve			0
protest : but some union members say a one - to - eight ratio is still not safe enough ( pictures posed by models ) professor @entity88 , @entity31 's deputy chief executive , described the measures as ' an important step forward ' but added : ' there is no floor or ceiling number on the required number of nursing staff that can be applied across the whole of the @entity8			1
' assessing patient needs [ is ] paramount when making decisions about the number of nursing staff , and planning should allow for flexibility on a day - to - day or shift - by - shift basis			0
' yet @entity104 , chairman of the @entity105 which includes union members and the @entity41 , said last month one - to - eight was an absolute minimum and a ' red card '			0
another campaign called four to one has been launched by @entity111 members after nurses told of ' horror stories ' of wards with 12 or 14 patients per nurse			0
' we need to reinforce the message that one nurse caring for more than eight patients is not only unsatisfactory , it is dangerous , ' ms @entity104 wrote in the industry magazine @entity123			0
' it could mean the difference between life and death ... a one to eight ratio buys just seven and a half minutes of a registered nurse â€™s time per patient per hour			2
' what can you do in seven and a half minutes ? make a cup of tea , strip and make two beds , do cardiopulmonary resuscitation knowing three minutes without oxygen could leave a patient dead or brain dead ? ' the move comes after an inquest heard a retired policeman had to tell nurses his mother had died after finding her ' propped up ' and ' cold ' during a hospital visit			1
death : an inquest heard @entity149 ( pictured ) was found ' propped up ' in her hospital bed by her son @entity149 , 85 , from @entity152 , @entity153 , was found dead by @entity154 , 54 , on january 22 last year , 30 minutes after she had last been checked by a nurse			0
nurses at @entity159 in @entity153 had no idea mrs @entity149 had died until her son - who had unknowingly been downstairs getting a coffee - raised the alarm , the widow 's inquest was told			0
a @entity163 spokesman told @entity164 today : ' at the moment it 's for local @entity8 bodies to decide staffing levels but in light of the @entity170 report , the @entity163 has been very involved			1
' staffing levels are something that we want to be looked at in more detail and that 's why we commissioned @entity31 to produce this draft guidance			1
' there are over 5,100 more nurses on our wards since 2010 ... we have increased the @entity8 budget in real terms and are clear that hospitals must balance their books whilst ensuring compassionate , quality care for all			2
' we know this can and is being done			0
' a new website , which was originally due to be launched last month , is now due to go live next month with an unprecendented level of detail on how well individual hospital wards are staffed			0
a public consultation on the staffing plans , meanwhile , is running until june 10 and the guidelines are due to be finalised this summer .			1

rules are suggested in draft guidelines in wake of damning @entity199 inquiry
report was commissioned by @entity8 due to fears about under - staffing
but campaigners warn even a *1:8* ratio is not generous enough
it is ' enough time to make a cup of tea , two beds and do some resuscitation '
and the guideline is likely to be flexible , not laid down *fully* by @entity216
