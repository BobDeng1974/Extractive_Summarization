@entity0 scrambled to a 16 - 12 victory over @entity2 at @entity3 thanks to a controversial try five minutes from time			1
trailing 12 - 6 at half - time , @entity4 pulled the @entity0 back to 12 - 9 with a 59th - minute penalty and then in the 75th minute launched a crossfield kick into the @entity2 ' goal area where brothers @entity9 and @entity11 both went for the ball which rebounded for @entity13 to touch down			1
after a long delay the @entity14 approved the try and @entity4 converted for @entity0 to clinch victory and move into the @entity19 's top four			1
@entity11 ( left ) and his brother @entity20 compete for the ball which led to @entity0 's winning try had @entity2 won , @entity24 's relegation would have been confirmed given the @entity25 lost 74 - 19 to @entity26 on saturday			1
should @entity2 lose all six of their remaining fixtures , @entity24 would need to win all five of their own and earn a bonus point in at least three of them in order to avoid the drop			0
despite being under constant pressure up front , @entity2 showed they were more than a match for @entity0 with the ball in hand and @entity20 was left with no alternative but to take @entity41 's clever kick through into touch right on the @entity0 line			2
@entity4 ( centre ) kicks penalty during the @entity19 match for the @entity0 at @entity3 @entity2 promptly drove the line - out effectively for hooker @entity48 to score and @entity41 converted for 7 - 0 after 10 minutes			1
it seemed @entity50 must score when he cut back inside , but the winger slipped just inside the @entity2 22 and the @entity2 covered well before @entity52 was caught offside at a scrum and @entity4 kicked a 15th - minute penalty to make it 7 - 3			1
both @entity56 and number eight @entity57 were making their bulk count with big runs in midfield as @entity0 dominated possession			0
@entity48 ( centre on the floor ) celebrates scoring their first try with @entity68 in the first half but @entity2 looked dangerous whenever they had the ball and @entity41 had the crowd on their feet with a weaving run into the @entity0 ' 22 before he was stopped			0
@entity20 ran his brother 's long kick out of defence right back at @entity2 and when @entity77 went off his feet , @entity4 kicked his second penalty in the 29th minute to make it 7 - 6			1
right on half - time , @entity2 showed what they can do within the ball in hand , producing a period of sustained pressure with wingers @entity87 and @entity89 making big runs and the latter was inches from scoring			2
@entity87 ( centre ) crosses the line to score the @entity2 second try and give them a commanding lead @entity2 recycled , lost the ball , recovered it and @entity77 showed real presence of mind to cut back inside and throw a lovely long pass to @entity87 for the winger to hurtle over in the corner with two tacklers hanging on			0
the try was given after the referee went to the @entity14 and it put @entity2 12 - 6 up at the break , @entity41 hitting the post with the conversion from the touchline			1
@entity2 lost two early second half line - outs deep in the @entity0 ' 22 , and when @entity111 was taken out in the line - out , @entity41 was well short with the 45 - metre penalty in the 48th minute			2
@entity114 of @entity0 ( centre ) feels the full force of a challenge from @entity68 and @entity118 they were costly misses as @entity4 slotted a penalty in the 59th minute to make it 12 - 9 after @entity121 strayed offside			2
@entity2 kicked it straight out from the restart and were penalised at the scrum for collapsing			0
@entity4 had a chance to level the scores but his kick at goal from halfway was short			0
@entity0 stepped up the pressure and @entity4 was nearly through with the @entity2 showing signs of slipping off the pace			0
however , they seemed to be hanging on until @entity0 mounted one last effort and @entity13 got the crucial score in minute 75			0
@entity89 attempts to break through a number of @entity0 tackles during the clash @entity139 looks to pass and get @entity2 on the attack during the @entity19 match up			0

@entity13 scored with five minutes remaining after brothers @entity9 and @entity11 competed for a crossfield kick which needed the @entity14 's approval
the @entity2 led 12 - 6 at half - time before @entity0 fought back to win
@entity4 kicked well for the away side *including* converting the try
