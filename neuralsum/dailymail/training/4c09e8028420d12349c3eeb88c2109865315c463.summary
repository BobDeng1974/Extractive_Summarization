' i 'm so upset now that i have decided to change my will , stating that the garden will stay open to the public for one year after my death , and then be destroyed			1
' he added : ' not bulldozed as such , but i will ensure that all the personal aspects which really make the garden so extraordinary are taken away			0

' @entity26 was already a gardener , and within weeks i became one , too , but the turning point came in 1974 , when the farmer did nâ€™t want the field for his stock any more			0
' so we began to plant our yew hedges and trees , to make borders and plant an orchard			0
' combining their prodigious talents , the couple spent the next 30 years transforming the field in to formal gardens with a rose garden , pleached lime avenue , kitchen garden and fountains			2

' this was a very generous offer but when offered such a gift , our board of trustees considers it against strict acquisition criteria			1
