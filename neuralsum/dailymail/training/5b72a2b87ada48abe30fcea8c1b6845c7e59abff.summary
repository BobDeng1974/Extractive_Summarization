by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:00 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 12:32 est , 20 november 2013 defence secretary @entity2 warned delaying the recruitment of reservists would cause chaos defence secretary @entity2 today agreed to hold an annual review of the fighting power of the @entity8 in a bid to head off a @entity11 rebellion			1
the government faced a crunch commons vote after conservative backbenchers threatened to delay plans to expand the @entity8 to 30,000 to offset cuts of 20,000 in regular forces by 2020			1
mr @entity2 pleaded with @entity11 rebels not to derail his plans to replace thousands of professional soldiers with reservists			1
but he accepted a separate amendment which will require annual external reports to @entity24 on recruitment and retention to the @entity27			2
the government is reducing the total standing armed forces to just 82,000 under plans to save billions of pounds , as the @entity33 military pulls out of @entity34			2
ministers argue that having 30,000 reservists on standby will mean the @entity33 is still able to launch a sustained military campaign lasting years if it was necessary			1
figures released earlier this month showed the @entity8 's reserve numbers fell from 19,220 in october 2012 to 19,090 in october 2013 , raising further concerns about the ability to meet the government 's target			0
opponents , led by @entity11 mp @entity45 , warn recruitment targets have been ‘ badly missed ’ , with costs rising and ‘ herculean assumptions ’ being made by the @entity49 to ensure that the plan works			1
however , mr @entity2 argues that the cuts to the regular army are already being made , and halting the recruitment of reservists would cause more problems for the forces			1
‘ i believe it would be very confusing , very chaotic , for the @entity8 to have the course on which it is set interrupted at this stage , ’ he told @entity58 's today programme			0
‘ we can not go back			0
the @entity8 has set out a course , it 's executing its plan and to halt that or to seek to reverse it at this stage would simply create confusion in the ranks			0
’ top brass : head of the @entity8 sir @entity73 ( left ) has joined mr @entity2 in warning the @entity11 rebels against derailing the military reforms mr @entity2 said he was ‘ confident ’ that the additional numbers of reservists needed under the plan would be delivered in the next five years			1
military top brass also joined mr @entity2 in urging the rebels to back down			1
general sir @entity73 , the head of the @entity8 , said : ' increasing and rebuilding the @entity8 is crucial to delivering the fighting force of the future			0
' to reverse course at this stage would be destabilising and damaging , leave a gap in our capability and deprive talented young people of an opportunity to benefit from military service			0
' ringleader : @entity11 mp @entity45 said the reaction to his call for delay had been ' hysterical ' the threat of rebellion on an amendment to the @entity98 which would force the the @entity2 to report to @entity24 on the ‘ viability and cost - effectiveness ’ of his plans appeared to recede after mr @entity2 's concession			1
it would have forced him to spell out in detail how he intends to implement his plans , and would not be permitted to go ahead without the approval of both houses			0
mr @entity45 claimed criticism of his amendment had ‘ bordered on almost hysteria ’			0
but mr @entity45 told the @entity58 : ‘ we have concerns about its viability and cost - effectiveness			0
there are a number of things that are not going right with this plan and the government have not been able to answer our questions			0
‘ we have badly missed reserve recruitment targets , we have decline in @entity8 ( @entity8 ) numbers , costs are rising , there are herculean assumptions to make the plan work			1
‘ all we are saying with these amendments is they will stop the implementation of the government 's reservists plans until their viability and cost - effectiveness has been presented to and accepted by @entity24 ... some of the accusations against this amendment have bordered on almost hysteria			2
’ retired officer colonel @entity139 , who heckled mr @entity2 over cuts during his @entity11 party conference speech last month , warned the expensive plan could endanger lives			1
he said : ' reserve recruitment is catastrophically failing to meet targets , and those reservists who are recruited will be dangerously under - trained			2
' providing only 40 days of training a year for is irresponsible and demonstrates a worryingly cavalier attitude towards lives			0
' the @entity8 is set to be renamed the @entity8 and minsters insist a new recruitment drive is already underway			0
retired colonel @entity139 ( left ) who heckled mr @entity2 at the @entity11 conference , warned the changes could put lives at risk in a letter to potential rebels last night mr @entity2 said : ' i hope colleagues will support the government in resisting @entity45 's amendment			1
' to do otherwise will not only give a significant fillip to the @entity162 but , more significantly , would risk serious damage to our future armed forces			2
' there is a very significant risk that halting , or threatening to halt , the implementation of measures in the @entity170 would hit morale among the existing reserve forces , confuse employers , and make future recruitment a much more difficult task			2

@entity2 warns conservative *mps* it is too late to change course
regular forces to be cut by 20,000 , offset by expanding reserves to 30,000
@entity11 rebels warn targets to recruit reservists are being badly missed
