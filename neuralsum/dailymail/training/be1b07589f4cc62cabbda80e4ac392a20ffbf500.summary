nearly one in 10 couples are now ethnically mixed , according to an official analysis revealed today			1
it said there are 2.3 million people living as part of a mixed couple , nine per cent of all those who live as part of a couple , and their numbers have gone up by more than a third in a decade			1
the figures on inter-ethnic relationships , compiled by the @entity13 , suggest that racial prejudice is a diminishing force and more and more people are happy to share their lives with someone from a different ethnic background			1
the report also found that 833,000 children , some seven per cent of those under 16 or still at school in @entity23 and @entity24 , are being brought up in a home led by an ethnically - mixed couple			1
the count of ethnically mixed couples was taken from the 2011 national census results			2
the most likely people to be living in a mixed relationship are those whose parents were ethnically mixed themselves , the report said			1
‘ people from the mixed groups are themselves likely to be the result of inter-ethnic relationships that have emerged in the last 60 years from post-war immigration patterns , ’ the @entity13 report said			1
‘ these groups have a much younger age profile than some of the other ethnic groups and 80 per cent of the people in this group were born in the @entity45			2
’ the number of ethnically mixed couples went up from 1,709,000 at the time of the 2001 census to 2,327,000 in 2011 , the report said			2
the 36 per cent increase in numbers meant the percentage of mixed couples in the population went up from seven per cent to nine per cent of all couples			0
around eight per cent of married couples were from mixed backgrounds , and 12 per cent of cohabiting couples			0
the @entity13 analysis counted different white groups such as ‘ white @entity45 , ’ ‘ white @entity61 ’ and ‘ other whites ’ - including people from parts of @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 - as ethnically different			1
however , the report said that despite an increase of more than a million in the number of people classed as ‘ other white ’ as a result of eastern @entity65 immigration , the percentage of other white people in mixed relationships went down between 2001 and 2011			2
the other white group , the report said , is made up mostly of people born outside @entity45 , and includes half a million @entity81 people			0
the group ‘ contains more recent migrants who have had less time to establish mixed relationships , ’ the @entity13 said			1
numbers of men and women in mixed relationships were broadly the same across most ethnic groups			0
‘ however , there were some differences between the sexes for some ethnic groups , ’ the report said			0
‘ the biggest differences were found in the @entity96 group where women were twice as likely – 39 per cent – to be in an inter-ethnic relationship as men			0
’ by contrast , @entity100 men were more likely to be in a mixed relationship than @entity100 women			0
fewer than a third of those in mixed relationships are over the age of 50			0
‘ older people may have more traditional views on inter-ethnic relationships and they were also more likely to have entered into a relationship at a time when @entity23 and @entity24 were less ethnically diverse , ’ the report said			2
‘ younger people are more likely to have grown up in the @entity45 exposed to other ethnic groups , and to respond to observed changes in society , in terms of increasing diversity			0
’ the most common inter-ethnic relationships were between white @entity45 , other white , and white @entity61 people , involving over 500,000 people			0
just under 1.5 million people were in unclassified ethnically mixed relationships .			1
