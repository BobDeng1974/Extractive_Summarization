by @entity0 published : 08:50 est , 5 october 2013 updated : 11:22 est , 5 october 2013 a council spent £ 338,000 on private education for just one disabled boy in the last academic year , it can be revealed			1
authorities paid £ 525million to teach nearly 11,500 youngsters with special needs in independent schools nationwide - which works out at nearly £ 46,000 per child			1
disabled children educated privately have either severe physical disabilities , behavioural problems , emotional difficulties or suffer from severe autism			1
private sector : councils paid £ 525million to educate 11,500 children in independent schools in the last academic year			1
while some authorities were able to educate the majority of pupils in their own schools , others racked up large bills putting children in private schools but while some authorities are able to teach youngsters in their own state - run special schools , others hand thousands of pounds over to the private sector instead			1
critics have said this is often not in the child 's or the parents ' best interests because the special schools can be a long way from home			0
campaign groups also questioned whether local authorities are getting good value because of the huge annual bills			0
@entity44 paid £ 338,000 to educate one disabled boy in a secondary school last year , according to the figures released to @entity48 under the @entity49			1
the money pays for the child 's education , transport and day - to - day healthcare costs			1
responses from 124 local education authorities revealed 11,459 special needs pupils were educated privately last year			1
@entity58 paid £ 307,183 to educate one male pupil in a secondary school while @entity61 , in @entity62 , spent £ 304,272 on secondary education for a child			1
in contrast , @entity65 managed to educate 31 pupils privately at a cost of £ 1,730,965			2
specialist care : disabled children educated privately have either severe physical disabilities , behavioural problems , emotional difficulties or suffer from severe autism ( picture posed by models ) the most they paid for education was £ 90,241 to teach a secondary school boy - less than a third of the bills elsewhere			1
the huge disparity in the cost of private school places for disabled children was seized upon by critics as evidence that some authorities are not getting good value for money			1
@entity91 , chairman for the @entity92 , said the figures show some local education authorities are overspending on private schools for children with special needs			2
‘ there are some children who need 24 - hour care , some of whom are autistic children , and it is right that resources are devoted to looking after these people , ’ he said			2
‘ the figures suggest that while some authorities can look after children “ in house ” others are having to outsource to the private sector			2
‘ huge discrepancies between the amount of money local authorities are spending on education for children with special needs would suggest some are relying too heavily on private providers			1
' this is obviously going to be more expensive for the taxpayer			0
‘ these discrepancies should not exist – local authorities need to get value for money			2
councils have to weigh up getting good value for money and providing the best possible care			2
’ @entity126 , chief executive of the @entity127 said : ' it ’s important that pupils with special education needs have access to teaching that caters for their requirements			0
' but carting a select few pupils off to private school is neither good value for taxpayers ’ money nor does it improve special education provisions in mainstream schools			0
' local schools should be able to cater for all pupils rather just those who do n’t meet requirements that mean they get sent elsewhere			0
a spokesman for @entity44 defended sending children with special needs to private school and said they were working to reduce the cost to the taxpayer			0
' since 2006 the number of placements of children in independent schools has fallen from well over 140 to between 80 and 90 depending on the time of the year , ' he said			0
' this has resulted in savings of over £ 2million being made from the @entity159 , which has been re-invested in local schools to improve the special educational needs provision available			0
' the needs of some children are so complex and specialised that we will never be in a position to meet them completely within the county , and a single specialist school would not cover the needs of every child			0
' however , we have developed robust procedures to monitor all plans to ensure these children and their families receive the best possible support			0
' a spokesman from the @entity177 said it was for individual councils to decide how best to educate disabled children			1
' children with special educational needs should be educated in a school which can meet their needs			0
it is for councils to make decisions about placements based on the individual needs of the child , ' he said			0
' special free schools and academies are giving parents of children with @entity196 more choice within the state sector , with open and approved special free schools providing more than 1,100 places			0

£ 46,000 per child to educate 11,500 disabled youngsters privately
