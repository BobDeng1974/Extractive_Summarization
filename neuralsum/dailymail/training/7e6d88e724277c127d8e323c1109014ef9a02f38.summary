swathes of @entity2 users have expressed annoyance at the roll - out of an experimental new feature			1
users of the social network have reported seeing tweets favourited by other people in their own timeline			1
in addition to this , some members have complained that their feed shows tweets alerting them that an account they follow has followed a new account			2
unhappy : some @entity2 users are seeing tweets favourited by other people in their timeline , as well as who they have recently followed			1
many people are unhappy with the experiment and are making their views known			2
@entity27 , a journalist at @entity28 is among users who are seeing the changes ( tweet above ) currently , only retweets posted by accounts that someone has personally chosen to follow show up on timelines , as well as advertisements , @entity32 reports			2
members have voiced their anger over the ‘ experiment ’ , with many explaining that they were never given the option to opt out of sharing content they had marked as a ' favourite ' with their followers			2
one user said : ' i really , really hate all these new @entity2 things ' , while another vented : ' if i wanted to see what my friends favourite , i could look			1
i neither want nor need it added to my timeline			0
' pictured above is a screenshot taken by @entity27 showing notifications of that someone has favourited content and followed accounts on @entity2 the ' favourite ' function can be used in a number of ways - it can be employed as a way of acknowledging a tweet and saying thank you , or as a way of saving a message so it is easy to access at a later date			1
until now , the action of favouriting a message was more ' private ' that retweeting it to followers			0
many people have expressed that they simply do n’t understand the point of the tweak , arguing that it makes favouriting a tweet the same as retweeting it			0
the experiment is thought to have been taking place for around a month and commentators say it is unlikely to roll out in its current form			0
it is currently unclear how many users are seeing the change in their timeline and are sharing their ' favourite ' tweets whether they want to or not			1
@entity95 asked @entity2 whether it plans to extend the reach of the experiment and was directed to a blog post about the company 's experiments written last year			1
the blog post , says : ‘ we ’ve tested various features with small groups of our 200 million users before determining what we ’ll release			0
these tests are essential to delivering the best possible user experience			0
‘ we also experiment with features that may never be released to everyone who uses @entity2			1
those experiments are perhaps even more valuable because they help us decide what not to do - which is important as we work to keep @entity2 simple while improving the user experience			1
‘ ultimately , our goal is to learn and keep making the product better ; we are n’t necessarily looking to launch all of the experiments we roll out			0
’ @entity2 has now updated its help page to shed light on timeline changes			1
it reads : ' when we identify a @entity2 , an account to follow , or other content that 's popular or relevant , we may add it to your timeline			1
' this means you will sometimes see tweets from accounts you do n't follow			0
we select each tweet using a variety of signals , including how popular it is and how people in your network are interacting with it			2
our goal is to make your home timeline even more relevant and interesting			0
' some people who have been affected by the experimental changes are unhappy ( such as the twitter user above ) although it is not known if the changes will be rolled out widely @entity2 users such as @entity138 ( above ) may hope that the experiment will be encourage @entity2 to largely stay the same and help it decide ' what not to do '			1
the company says in a blog post that it has used experiments to decide upon future features before @entity2 has been leapfrogged by @entity145 , which is not the third most used social media app. almost a third of 18 to 24 - year - olds now use the self - destructing messaging app , compared to 24 per cent who use @entity2 as well as news of an unpoular experiment , last week it was reported that @entity2 has been leapfrogged by @entity145 to become the third most used social media app. almost a third of 18 to 24 - year - olds now use the self - destructing messaging app , which is more than double the amount of users the company had in november			1
@entity158 still reigns as the most popular , however , with more than 75 per cent of millennials using it , closely followed by @entity161 with 43 per cent			0
@entity145 's popularity is also growing among 25 to 34 - year - olds , and in the over 35 age group - albeit more slowly than among the the younger age group			1
the figures were taken from @entity169 ’s june @entity168 report			0
@entity170 is used by 10.7 per cent of millennials , and @entity172 is just above on 17.9 per cent			0
@entity173 sits in fifth on 18 per cent			0
@entity169 's vice president , marketing and insights , @entity174 wrote : ' long term success in the social media sector is no given			0
' achieving critical mass is an important step in eventually reaching the winner ’s circle , and with @entity145 it would appear to be right in that sweet spot			2
' if usage begins to accelerate significantly from this point forward , who knows how big it can eventually get ? ' last year , @entity145 turned down a $ 3 billion ( £ 1.8 billion ) acquisition bid from @entity158 .			2
