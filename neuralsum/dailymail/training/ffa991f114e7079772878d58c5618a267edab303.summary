members of some eastern @entity3 gangs are making more money from illegally harvesting shellfish than from selling drugs , police said			0
divers working for organised crime gangs are using the banned practice of electro - fishing - where sea creatures are electronically stunned - to bring in hauls of worth up to £ 65,000 a day			1
the gangs are targeting razor clams off the coast of @entity15 , west @entity16			1
the shellfish make up an important part of the fishing industry , contributing £ 3.1 million to the @entity16 economy in 2013			2
black market : members of some eastern @entity3 gangs are making up to £ 65,000 a day from illegally harvesting razor clams off the west coast of @entity16 - more than they make selling drugs			1
file image detective chief inspector @entity28 , responsible for @entity15 , @entity29 and @entity30 said : ' the money to organised crime and criminals is significant , it makes more than drugs does			0
' but he explained that the practice was difficult to stop as unlicensed boats destroyed evidence of electro - fishing , which has been illegal since 1998 , over the side of the boat when police approached			1
he said that there are 80 known individuals involved in the black market fishing , many of eastern @entity3 origin , and that their sophisticated operation is very efficient			0
he explained that the gangs have boats , specialist equipment and divers who are trained in electro - fishing			2
he said : ' they have a generator on the boat and deploy electrodes and probes on to the seabed and run them along the seabed , between 10 and 15 metres deep			0
' the electricity stuns the razor clams and divers walk behind the boat scooping the clams up			2
' popular : the illegal shellfish are quickly transported to @entity64 , where they are exported to the lucrative @entity67 market via @entity68			0
file image ' many of the divers are known to be of eastern @entity3 origin and there is concern that they are being exploited and their personal safety is in danger - because of the proximity of electricity in water			0
' there is a major concern that we will be faced with fatalities in the waters off @entity15			0
' he added that they have vehicles that allow them to quickly transport their haul to @entity64 airport , where they are usually shipped within 24 hours to @entity67 markets via @entity68			0
the gangs also have a way of legitimising their catch for overseas sale - despite lacking legal documents - make the practice of electro - fishing , which renders any shellfish harvested legally unfit to eat , is highly dangerous			1
it is estimated that illegally active fishing boats are taking between 500 - 600kg of razor clams a day , while a comparable fishing boat on a legitimate fishing trip might recover between one and two kilos a day			1
but it has been illegal since 1998 to use electro - fishing methods to harvest the shellfish			1
earlier this year the @entity109 brought in even tougher licensing laws and punishments to deter poachers			0
one boat had been stopped last thursday under suspicion of being involved in electro - fishing , @entity113 said			2
inquiries into the ownership of the boat are understood to be ongoing by @entity119			0
last week , a multi-agency operation run from @entity121 , involving @entity113 , @entity119 , @entity15 and the @entity122 , kicked into action to clamp down on electro - fishing for razor clams off the coast			1
competition : electro - fishing , which has been banned since 1998 , can bring in up to 600kg of razor clams a day , while a licensed boat fishing off the coast of @entity15 , pictured , might just bring in one kilo			1

gangs use electro - fishing to harvest razor clams off coast of @entity16
the illegal practice involves electronically stunning creatures on seabed
it brings in an estimated 500kg clams a day , worth up to £ 65,000
