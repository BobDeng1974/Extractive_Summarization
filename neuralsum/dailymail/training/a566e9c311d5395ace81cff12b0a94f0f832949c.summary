@entity0 complained the comment by a detective was ‘ overtly racist ’ because it referred to the black and ethnic minority population in @entity4 , @entity5 senior officers failed to investigate a policeman who compared an inner - city borough to ‘ @entity10 ’ in the aftermath of the 2011 @entity5 riots , it was claimed yesterday			1
black officer @entity0 complained the comment by a detective was ‘ overtly racist ’ because it referred to the black and ethnic minority population in @entity4 , @entity5			1
but he said senior managers attempted to ‘ bury the incident ’			0
@entity17 said he found it ‘ incredible ’ that managers failed to investigate the comment – allegedly made in the days of heightened racial tension after the police shooting of @entity23 , which sparked the @entity5 riots and looting – for almost three years			1
the plain clothes officer claimed it was investigated only after he included it in a report about his experiences of alleged racism , corruption and cover - ups within policing in @entity4			1
the force was described as ‘ institutionally racist ’ by the inquiry into the murder of black teenager @entity38 and mr @entity0 said his experiences showed it had not done enough to combat racism among its own officers			2
but his attempts to force @entity43 to address the problem resulted in him facing a campaign of ‘ detriment and hostility ’ , he told an employment tribunal			2
the former paratrooper said his senior officers falsely accused him of incompetence and lying in an attempt to discredit him as a whistleblower , and called their behaviour ‘ classic school ground bullying ’			0
he was treated as a ‘ troublemaker ’ , accused of losing evidence in a stabbing case and overloaded with paperwork to punish him for speaking out , he said			0
disturbingly , he told @entity62 in @entity63 that his senior officers ’ behaviour had hindered his police work and even stopped him from preventing a murder			0
@entity67 , who has served in the @entity68 for 18 years , said he had attempted to raise his concerns with the force ’s commissioner , sir @entity72 , and other top - ranking officers			0
mr @entity0 's attempts to force @entity43 to address the problem resulted in him facing a campaign of ‘ detriment and hostility ’ , he told an employment tribunal but he claimed the ‘ @entity85 ’ comment , allegedly made by @entity84 , was investigated only after he raised it at a previous employment tribunal , in which he unsuccessfully accused the @entity68 of race discrimination			1
@entity17 said : ‘ in early august 2011 after the shooting of @entity23 , there were several witnesses to @entity89 in @entity4 commenting “ it ’s like being in @entity10 ” in reference to the numbers of @entity93 [ black and minority ethnic ] people around him			1
‘ i expressed concern that no formal investigation had taken place into this incident			0
there was a clear breach of policy and legislation , including the @entity105 that was not investigated			0
@entity17 claimed senior officers failed to investigate a policeman who compared an inner - city borough to ‘ @entity10 ’ in the aftermath of the 2011 @entity5 riots ( file picture ) ' to my mind the @entity114 [ senior leadership team ] managers who had made the decision to bury the incident were at fault … i found it incredible that the @entity114 decision makers would buck policy and legislation then protect @entity123 ’s behaviour			1
’ @entity17 , 41 , said @entity4 referred the 2011 incident to the @entity125 in 2014 only after he had raised concerns in his previous employment tribunal			1
the police watchdog referred it back to the @entity68 with a recommendation that the force ’s own professional standards department should investigate			2
the employment tribunal was told the internal probe found @entity123 had no case to answer			2
@entity17 told the hearing he had unearthed a ‘ white collar criminal network ’ in @entity4 but was ‘ portrayed as a pathological liar ’ after reporting his findings , and claimed his previous managers briefed his new bosses in a different borough that he ‘ played the race card ’			2
he has previously lost two employment tribunals in which he accused the @entity68 of overlooking him for promotion because of race discrimination			0
the @entity68 disputes his version of events , given during a current employment tribunal in which @entity17 claims he was treated unfairly after coming forward as a whistleblower			0

managers failed to investigate policeman who made comment , tribunal told
policeman used *phrase* in aftermath of the 2011 @entity5 riots , it is claimed
