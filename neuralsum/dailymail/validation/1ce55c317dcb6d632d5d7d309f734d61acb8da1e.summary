inspired by military obstacle courses , parkour involves turning everyday pieces of street furniture into objects to be ducked under , swung from , vaulted and climbed			0
the discipline has in turn inspired freerunning , the urban athletics movement followed by tens thousands of people around the world			0
' @entity52 ' is another dangerous craze altogether , and was popularised in 2013 by a team of daredevils in neighbouring @entity55			2
sidewalk skiing : the craze of tipping a moving truck onto two wheels was popularised by a group of daredevils in @entity55 in 2013 ' my inspiration is @entity9 's prime minster @entity65 who said that @entity10 does not have a word for impossible ' , the 21 - year - old said backflip : the amateur daredevil said he wanted to push the urban gymnastics craze to its limit in his home city of @entity9 , @entity10 to tip a truck onto its side a driver usually uses an asymmetrical ramp , then there is the difficult part - balancing it without allowing it to tip over while a daredevil scrambles into position on top			1
mr @entity6 now wants to push parkour even closer to its limits			2
' while the stunt is risky , i wanted to show how far people could push their skills with this sport , ' he said			0

he said : ' i want to convince the municipality to provide a park made especially for parkour so they can attract more people , who can practice and teach in a safe place			0
' i want to show the world that the @entity10 is a place where you can find talented people			0
' poise : the truck is not moving in all of his shots , but must be when it tilts on its side - with a driver who is able to keep it balanced do n't try this at home : with long stretches of highway and more than enough desert , the @entity10 is a suitable place to develop the craze mr @entity6 said his next goal is to create a parkour training facility where people all over the region can come and discover the sport			1
