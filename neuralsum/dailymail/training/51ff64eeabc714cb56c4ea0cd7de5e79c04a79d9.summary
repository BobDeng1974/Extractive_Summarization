by @entity0 , @entity1 editor almost £ 400million was wiped off the value of @entity4 ’s shares at one point yesterday after chief executive @entity6 announced he is stepping down			1
mr @entity6 , who has spent a decade at the supermarket ’s helm , is credited with taking @entity4 ’s from strength to strength , despite the cost of living crisis that has hurt customers			1
he is considered a retail success story and is now much sought - after , with speculation linking him with top jobs ranging from @entity16 to @entity17			1
supermarket sweep : @entity6 is to step down as @entity4 's chief executive in july after 10 years in the job during his tenure , the store ’s profits have almost trebled to £ 756million , while sales have increased by 59 per cent			1
at the same time the number of customers visiting stores has risen by around ten million a week			0
recent success has been built around an expansion of the ‘ local ’ convenience stores and promotions such as ‘ @entity32 ’			0
mr @entity6 , who was raised in @entity33 , @entity34 , joined @entity4 ’s in march 2004 from @entity16 , where he was head of the retail group ’s food department			1
the 52 - year - old father of two enjoys the limelight and a flamboyant approach to public relations , which means always being ready to fight @entity4 ’s corner in tv and radio interviews			1
during his tenure , he has masterminded a successful commercial partnership with @entity45 and , more recently , @entity46			1
he also made great play of a decision to ditch his @entity49 , an £ 80,000 sports car , in favour of a ‘ green ’ @entity53 limousine , at £ 88,000 , for his commute to @entity55			0
the @entity57 fan , who lives near @entity58 , @entity59 , has listed his recreations as coaching a village football team and sailing			0
news of the departure of mr @entity6 , who will step down in july , saw the firm ’s share price drop by 5.8 per cent at one stage , taking the firm ’s market value down by some £ 395million to £ 6.38billion			1
at the end of the day ’s trading shares were down by 2.3 per cent , equating to a fall in value of £ 156million			0
this drop signalled some concerns about the future of the @entity78 ’s joint second - largest supermarket			0
@entity4 ’s grew sales by 3.1 per cent in the 12 weeks to january 5 , @entity80 said , ahead of the 2.9 per cent market growth maintaining its market share of 17.1 per cent			1
@entity83 : incoming @entity4 's ceo @entity84 will be paid a salary of £ 900,000 its market share is under threat from the budget chains @entity89 and @entity90 on one side and supermarket rivals @entity93 and @entity16 on the other			1
at the same time , there is pressure from the likes of @entity98 and @entity99 – and now @entity100			0
independent retail analyst @entity101 said : ‘ supermarket retailing is getting a bit tougher and it ’s understandable [ @entity6 ] wants to go out on a high note			1
’ mr @entity6 has not lined up another job but said he felt young enough to take another ‘ big one ’ , although a non-compete deal rules him out of taking a role with a rival grocery chain for 12 months			2
he said : ‘ there ’s plenty of energy left in the old dog yet			0
i ’m sure the right opportunity will come along and i ’ll know what it is when i see it			0
’ mr @entity6 is being replaced by the firm ’s commercial director , @entity84 , 53 , a former director of @entity120 and @entity121 , who has been at @entity4 ’s for ten years			1
analyst @entity122 said : ‘ coupe represents continuity for @entity4 ’s , something that may reassure investors who will naturally be a little disconcerted by change			2
’ by alex brummer city editor @entity129 : @entity6 and @entity130 at a promotional event in 2012 in the grey world of @entity78 ’s corporate elite , @entity6 stands apart from the crowd			2
he is the supermarket boss with the market stall - holder ’s gift of the gab , and an orange perma - tan and head of lustrous chestnut locks that look more suited to a daytime television presenter			0
gregarious and with tremendous self - confidence , he is the opposite of his former great rival , the taciturn and now retired @entity98 chief , sir @entity147			0
behind @entity6 ’s love of showmanship and the limelight is an extremely sharp brain that is able to respond to any question about his business with rapid - fire facts and figures			2
over his ten years at the helm , he has turned around a failing family - controlled enterprise			0
his great achievement was to reposition @entity4 ’s as a favourite place to shop for aspirational families who might otherwise be seduced by rival @entity93 , with its more upmarket image			2
the value placed on @entity6 was reflected in the sharp fall yesterday in the @entity4 ’s share price following news of his departure			1
in 2004 he took over a dispirited company that had been pummelled by falling market share under the stewardship of @entity170 ( the last family member at the helm ) and wasteful investment decisions taken by @entity4 ’s successor sir @entity174 , who was ignominiously ejected from his job			2
@entity6 moved rapidly to turn the business around			2
part of his whirlwind approach involved cleverly anticipating people ’s preference for smaller convenience stores that were within walking distance of their homes and widening choice to include clothing			0
the result was spectacular , with profits tripling during his decade in charge – from £ 254million to £ 756million in the last full financial year – comfortably outdistancing @entity6 ’s former employers , @entity16			1
the group moved from a standing start to become the seventh - largest clothing retailer in the @entity78 and launched its own fashion brand ‘ @entity195 ’			0
@entity6 has an instinctive nose for the nation ’s food habits			2
apart from emphasising the supermarket ’s ‘ quality ’ image through its @entity203 range , he hired the nation ’s favourite television chef @entity45 to promote its image and products			0
@entity6 with chef @entity45 who he hired to promote @entity4 's image and products but perhaps his greatest achievement was to exploit technology in harness with attractive promotions in a way that entrenched customer loyalty			1
for example , check - out tills were designed to automatically ‘ price - match ’ items with those of rival supermarket so that shoppers could see that the prices they were paying at @entity4 ’s were cheaper ( or if not , they got a voucher to use the next time they shopped at the store )			1
this was a revolutionary piece of marketing			0
ahead of his rivals , @entity6 seized the possibilities of online shopping and @entity4 ’s now does £ 1billion of its annual sales of £ 25.6billion on the net			1
politically , he is not shy of expressing his forthright views : putting up a good case for lower taxes during an appearance on @entity241 ’s @entity240			0
however , he was also tackled by the audience over high levels of boardroom pay			0
@entity6 notoriously claimed that his own £ 900,000 salary ( 40 times the average @entity4 ’s employee ) was modest			1
lord of the isles : under @entity6 's tenure , check - out tills were designed to automatically ' price - match ' items with those of rival supermarket so that shoppers could see that the prices they were paying in fact , his total annual remuneration ( including pension contributions , share options and benefits ) was £ 2.6million			1
he also became embroiled in the horse meat scandal			0
at first , @entity6 claimed @entity4 ’s had not mislabelled any meat but then had to remove meat burgers from shelves after concern that they might have become contaminated			1
whoever takes over from grammar school - educated @entity6 will have a tough task			2
@entity4 ’s @entity271 sales figures showed some of the momentum he had built up – to gain a 17 per cent share of the market – was fading			2
the invasion of @entity277 - owned @entity89 and @entity90 will be a formidable challenge for those now charge if they are to replicate the savvy , showmanship and success of @entity283 .			0

@entity6 to depart after the supermarket group 's *agm* on july 9
speculation is linking him with top jobs ranging from @entity16 to @entity17
during his tenure , @entity4 's profits have almost trebled to £ 756million
