@entity0 is n’t standing outside the @entity1 to endorse the view held by @entity3 that sunday 's ‘ @entity5 ’ between @entity6 and @entity7 is a glorified pub game			1
it is more a reminder that @entity0 is a unique @entity1 himself , the only player to captain both of @entity13 ’s most successful clubs — and deadliest of rivals — in the past 50 years			1
in six seasons under @entity16 at @entity6 between 1989 and 1995 , @entity0 won six major trophies , including the club ’s first league and @entity20			1
even surrounded by luminaries such as @entity22 , @entity23 and a young @entity24 , he was known as @entity25			0
@entity0 poses outside the @entity1 after @entity3 likened @entity7 vs @entity6 to a pub game @entity0 is the only player to have captained both @entity6 and @entity7 during his career at @entity7 , he spent two seasons at the end of the @entity30 helping to guide a new generation of stars dubbed @entity33 , including @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and a little known teenager called @entity38			1
while not demeaning the current @entity6 and @entity7 teams to the extent of former team - mate @entity3 — who controversially claimed sunday ’s lunchtime contest could be like ‘ the @entity44 versus the @entity1 ’ — @entity0 , who has retained his independence by turning down television and ambassadorial work at both clubs , agrees these are not vintage times for his former sides			1
taking @entity6 first , the former @entity13 captain says : ‘ they ’ve won their last five games but i watched them against @entity55 and they were poor			1
i could n’t work out how they were trying to play			0
@entity6 keep the ball but do n’t seem to go anywhere with it			1
just making 600 passes does n’t make you a great team these days			2
our 1994 team would have annihilated them			2
they ’re not powerhouses ‘ i think @entity67 is trying to do what he did with @entity69 but has n’t got the players suited for it			2
‘ with @entity69 he had @entity72 to sit in front of the back four so he could play 3 - 5 - 2			0
but i ’ve seen united a few times this season and i do n’t think they have any power in that midfield area			2
i ’m not saying @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 are bad players , but they ’re not powerhouses			2
they have n’t got the legs			0
‘ @entity87 and @entity88 are better teams because they have power all over the pitch			2
think about this @entity88 team ; @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95			0
there was a phase three or four years ago of looking at @entity98 and trying to get technical like them , because they had won the @entity100			0
power is more essential than these nice , technical players passing the ball			1
‘ @entity6 keep the ball but do n’t seem to go anywhere with it			1
just making 600 passes does n’t make you a great team these days			2
’ @entity107 scores against @entity55 to extend @entity6 's winning run to five games @entity0 insists @entity6 's 1994 double winning side would have easily beaten the club 's current crop the way @entity0 describes today ’s @entity114 , it sounds ideal for the 1994 double - winning side he played in			1
@entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity0 himself provided physicality and leadership in abundance , @entity24 and @entity124 speed on the flanks			1
‘ that @entity6 team would have beaten this current side without a doubt — it ’s a no - brainer , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ the 1994 side was the best ever , i honestly believe that			2
look at who we had ; @entity23 and @entity119 , @entity22 , @entity134 , @entity117 , @entity118 , we were also good players			2
they have tried to buy five or six new players to share the goals and it has n’t materialised			2
] you need those top strikers			2
city have @entity143 , @entity88 have @entity95 , even at the bottom @entity144 have @entity145 ‘ obviously the game is different now and you ca n’t tackle as much — you have to factor that in — but when you compare that team to the team now , we ’d annihilate them			0
’ to be even - handed , @entity0 is happy to assess @entity7 , too , following their disappointing @entity151 exit on top of some indifferent @entity114 form			1
‘ quite apart from @entity154 , i ca n’t understand why @entity155 left in the summer , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ i thought he was fantastic and left - sided centre - halves are priceless			0
instead of spending £ 20million on @entity159 , they could have saved the money			0
i ’d have spent whatever it took on a great striker like @entity163 or @entity164 , make a statement to replace @entity154 and the 35 goals he scored			1
instead they tried to buy five or six new players to share the goals around and it has n’t materialised			2
‘ you need top strikers			2
@entity87 have @entity143 , @entity88 have @entity95 , even at the bottom of the table @entity174 have @entity175 and @entity144 have @entity145			0
top clubs need more than one			0
when @entity87 lose @entity143 , they bring in @entity177			0
@entity7 lose @entity178 and nobody is scoring			1
’ @entity7 have been left downcast after their elimination from the @entity151 by @entity181 @entity0 was charged with taking care of the so - called ' @entity33 ' during his time at @entity184 listening to @entity0 speak — fittingly the interview takes place in @entity187 equidistant between @entity188 and @entity7 — you can hear the passion still burns bright			1
he still wants to succeed as a manager , despite his last job at @entity192 ending in the sack last january , and recalls with fervour the atmosphere in the dressing - room before big @entity6 - @entity7 games			1
‘ with @entity6 at @entity184 , there was always a lot of noise — “ let ’s get into them ”			1
i was vocal , @entity198 was vocal , @entity22 was vocal			0
even @entity205 would be shouting and he was the quietest one there			0
it was different at @entity208			0
we ’d be focused , almost silent in concentration			0
sometimes the manager [ @entity16 ] would get worried it was so quiet and gee us up — “ come on lads , are we up for this ? ” but we knew what we needed to do			0
‘ when i was at @entity7 , @entity6 were top dogs			1
we ’d go to @entity208 a bit apprehensive , wondering what would happen			0
one reason i am looking forward to this game is that neither team will be frightened of the other one			0
‘ i think @entity223 might go four at the back and have a real go at @entity7			1
but @entity226 will fancy getting at @entity6 ’s defence			1
’ @entity0 goes in for a tackle on @entity6 's @entity229 during the ' @entity5 ' in 1998 @entity38 celebrates after scoring in @entity7 's 3 - 0 defeat of @entity6 at @entity208 last season @entity0 , 47 , has good friends in both camps			1
he was in the @entity7 team when @entity38 made his debut against @entity236 16 years ago			1
‘ for me , @entity38 should be the first name on the @entity7 teamsheet , ’ he stresses			1
‘ it is sad his contract situation has been allowed to fester			0
you should n’t give anyone a contract out of sentiment but look at what he ’s still doing for the club			0
he ’s only 34 and the team struggled against @entity248 without him			0
‘ i remember strolling around in a training game when this little rascal steamed into me			0
i was angry and asked what he was doing , and he told me to “ f * * * ng shut up ! ” i asked @entity34 who this upstart was			1
“ that ’s @entity38 ” , he replied			1
you could tell he wanted it so much and what he ’s done for @entity7 will never be repeated			2
now he has to make a decision about his future			0
if he does n’t want to stay , to be in and out of the team , there will be no shame in him going to another club , but hopefully abroad ! i think he ’s got lots to offer			0
when you ’ve got his experience , even when you do n’t play well , you help your team - mates play better			0
’ for @entity6 today , @entity0 ’s pal @entity24 will be in the home dug - out next to @entity223			1
‘ i ’ve seen a change in @entity24			0
when i started my coaching badges , he said he would n’t bother with all that			0
yet there he was last summer with @entity3 and myself finishing our pro licenses together ! @entity0 would like to return to club management after spells with clubs including @entity192 and @entity236 @entity0 is slightly surprised that @entity24 has moved into management at @entity67 's assistant ‘ i ’m sure @entity24 will tell the new @entity6 players about what this game means to the fans			1
’ @entity24 had four matches in charge of the first team last season after @entity291 was sacked but @entity0 does n’t think it was necessarily a dress rehearsal			2
‘ he told me he loved every minute but i do n’t think @entity6 can be his first permanent management job , and he wo n’t think it can be , ’ said @entity0 , who began as a boss at @entity294			1
‘ people will say if things do n’t go well for @entity223 , @entity24 will get the hot - seat , but that is miles away for me			0
you have to learn your trade outside the @entity114			2
@entity24 ’s not fussed , he knows that			0
if they turn around and offer him the job , he ca n’t say no , but he is prepared to go down the levels to learn his trade			0

@entity7 face @entity6 in the @entity114 on sunday
@entity0 is the only player to have captained both of the great rivals
@entity6 are missing power players like those in the 1994 double winners
@entity7 should have replaced @entity154 with a top class striker
@entity38 told @entity0 to ' f * * * ing shut up ' on their first meeting
