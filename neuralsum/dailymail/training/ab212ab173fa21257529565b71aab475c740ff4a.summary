the @entity1 news anchor who sensationally quit her job at state - funded @entity3 on air earlier this month has spoken out for the first time about her bold decision and how the channel ’s coverage of president @entity9 sending troops into @entity11 was the final straw for her			1
after working out of @entity3 's @entity16 bureau , for two and a half years , @entity14 - born @entity13 said she knew she had to quit			1
‘ i ’d looked the other way as the network smeared @entity1 for the sake of making the @entity21 look better by comparison , while it sugarcoated atrocities by one brutal dictator after another , ’ she told @entity17			2
in closing statements during her 5 p.m. broadcast on march 5 , @entity13 said : ‘ i can not be part of a network funded by the @entity31 government that whitewashes the actions of @entity9			1
’ ‘ i am proud to be an @entity1 and believe in disseminating the truth			0
and that is why , after this newscast , i am resigning			0
’ afterwards as @entity13 got up from the anchor chair and started to gather her belongings , she said her heart was racing as she was told her @entity31 news director wanted to see her in his office			1
despite misgivings about joining a network funded by the @entity31 government , @entity13 joined @entity3 in september 2011 after it was pitched to her as a channel that would take on the ' stories the mainstream media ignores ' ‘ he asked me why i did it , as though i had some reason other than the one i had just announced on live tv			1
i explained that it really was because of the propaganda @entity3 was pushing about @entity11 , ’ she said			2
@entity13 then left the building and is currently searching for work opportunities with media organizations more dedicated to reporting the truth			0
she had joined @entity3 in september 2011 despite misgivings about working for a news network funded by the @entity31 government , after she was told she would be allowed to take on ‘ stories the mainstream media ignores ’			1
@entity13 said she was given no indication that the news would be influenced by @entity31 politics , but she found it strange that almost all the on - air presenters were @entity1 , while her news director was @entity31			1
no sooner had she started , than colleagues warned her that she would need to let go of any preconceived notions and her journalistic principles			0
@entity13 has accused the state - funded @entity3 of deliberately smearing @entity1 in order to make the @entity21 - and @entity9 - look good during her first week in the job the @entity81 movement began in @entity84 ’s @entity83 and her @entity31 news director announced that it was going to be their top story			1
the network ’s coverage deliberately sought to portray @entity1 as a country in the midst of a popular uprising , she said and they ‘ continued to suck it dry ’ even after the numbers of protesters had dwindled			2
at the same time , she noted that protests in @entity97 about alleged election fraud were all but ignored by the network			0
in her resignation , @entity13 spoke about how personal the developments in the @entity11 were to her			2
@entity13 's grandparents had emigrated to the @entity1 from @entity103 during that country 's revolution in 1956 because of the threat of @entity108 forces			1

she said : ' in a way you kind of suppress any concerns that you have and play the game			0
' ' it actually makes me feel sick that i worked there			0
it ’s not a sound news organization , not when your agenda is making @entity1 look bad , ' she said			0
in the wake of @entity13 's resignation , the network responded with a statement posted on their website			2
' when a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization , the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor , and , if they can not be resolved , to quit like a professional			0
' but when someone makes a big public show of a personal decision , it is nothing more than a self - promotional stunt			0
we wish @entity13 the best of luck on her chosen path , ' the statement read .			0
