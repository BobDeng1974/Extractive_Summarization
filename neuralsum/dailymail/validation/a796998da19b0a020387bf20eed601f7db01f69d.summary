she credits her as her ‘ greatest inspiration ’ – yet the one person model - turned - artist @entity3 has never painted is her popstar mother @entity3			1
the 22 - year - old , who is preparing for her first solo art exhibition in @entity7 , has received critical acclaim			1
but in an exclusive interview with @entity10 , she revealed she had still not plucked up the courage to capture the @entity13 star on canvas			2
i have n’t built myself up to it yet			2
‘ i am such a perfectionist and i worry that it might not turn out as amazing as i would want it to			2
she is so important to me and i want it to be just right			2
’ last week the 22 - year - old faced criticism for posting self portraits of herself as a bruised and bloodied victim of domestic violence online she has painted her close friends , her sister , even her boyfriend , @entity7 - based photographer @entity33 : ‘ i like to paint people i know rather than strangers , as i have a deeper understanding of their expressions and what each one means			1
‘ i will paint my mum at some point			2
the last time i was with her we were talking about it			0
i am thinking i might do a series , in different situations , that capture different sides of her			0
’ the youngest daughter of the @entity52 singer and her second husband , @entity54 film producer @entity53 , @entity3 grew up in @entity56 ’s @entity55			1
yet despite her high - profile parents , she describes her upbringing as ‘ sheltered ’ , saying : ‘ people find it hard to believe , but my childhood was really quite normal			1
‘ my mum has always been so modest and grounded and did n’t really involve herself in the world of celebrity			0
first and foremost , despite being an incredibly successful singer , she was a parent			0
‘ i never felt we were under a spotlight and we did n’t have paparazzi trailing us all the time , which i am grateful for			0
‘ i think because we did n’t do anything out of the ordinary we were left alone and that helped me growing up			0
i did n’t really feel any different to anyone else			0
’ it was only when @entity3 and her older sister @entity74 first accompanied her on a world tour that they realised just how fêted their mother was			1
‘ i remember , during her performances , seeing people crying in the crowd and i was like : “ woah , they must really love her ”			0
thousands of people would be singing along to her music – i think it was then that it hit home to me how famous she was			1
’ @entity3 would later go into modelling , starring in big budget campaigns for @entity95 and @entity96			1
two years ago , she put her modelling career on hold to move to the @entity99 and become a professional portrait artist			1
but still makes sure she speaks to her mother every day : ‘ i love to talk to her about what i am doing			1
i do n’t always listen to other people ’s feedback on my art , but with my mum i do listen			1
‘ we are really similar and we think in the same way			0
i am so lucky to have someone in my life who i am so so close to in that way and who really gets me			0
i never feel embarrassed showing my mum my work , even self - portraits that are quite raw			1
‘ both my parents have always supported me and encouraged me to do what i love			0
’ her self - portrait show , @entity118 , opens next week at the @entity119 in @entity7 ’s trendy @entity121 area			1
@entity3 has inherited her mother ’s love of pushing the boundaries and some of her paintings have sparked controversy			1
art attack : @entity3 prepares for her first solo exhibition at the @entity130 gallery in @entity121 @entity7 last week , she faced criticism that some of her self - portraits , which showed her as a bruised and bleeding victim of domestic abuse , were in ‘ very poor taste ’			1
yesterday , speaking from her studio in @entity7 , the young artist , whose mother actively campaigns for women ’s rights , explained that she wanted to shine a light on ‘ every trait of human nature ’			1
she said : ‘ it is so important that we do not hide away from important issues such as domestic abuse			0
we have to face up to it if we are going to stop it			0
‘ there is far too much abuse in the world			0
my mother campaigns on the issue and the most recent figures are really shocking			1
' i know some people may find my work quite intense , but i want to make emotive art. i want to make people feel something and look inside themselves			0
i want to evoke compassion and discussion			0
‘ in a world where everything is instant and accessible , and people put out fragments of themselves on social media , i search for moments of authenticity and am inspired by those who strive to be who they are			1
i am not putting my work out thinking everyone has to like it			0
art is in the eye of the beholder			1
’ @entity3 has been drawing and painting for ‘ as long as i can remember ’			1
while she admits she loves to sing , and would watch her mother with admiration as she belted out songs at the grand piano that took pride of place in the family home , her sketch book was always at her side			1
the model turned artists said that art has always been her passion since a young age her ‘ unexpected ’ move into modelling at 17 changed the way she looked at beauty			1
‘ i had singing lessons at school but my parents were never pushy , ’ she said			0
‘ i love singing and am not bad at it , but i do n’t think i have what it takes to make a career out of it			1
‘ art has always been my passion , since i was very young – it is like meditation and the feeling of satisfaction and closure you get when you complete a painting can not be beaten			1
i have always painted people			1
when i was younger i used to like drawing pretty girls from magazines but as i got older , after i started modelling and was in a world obsessed with looks , i started to prefer more distorted faces which have more depth			2
’ the 5ft 10in beauty admits it was the pressure to look a certain way that turned her off modelling full - time			1
‘ i still do some modelling , but not as much as i used to , ’ she said			2
‘ i want to work on something i created , whereas when you are modelling you are part of someone else ’s idea			2
‘ in modelling , your one main ambition is to look after the way you look			2
it is not something i felt i could immerse myself in full - time – plus i like eating nice food too much			2
’ she added : ‘ a part of modelling is great and fun , but it is also about chance and whether someone wants you and that brings a lot of pressure			1
you can feel a bit insecure			0
maybe in a way it is selfish , but i needed to find a better balance for me			0
@entity3 admits it was the pressure to look a certain was that finally turned her off modelling ‘ i had never planned to model			1
it was all quite bizarre how it happened and i was very young but it taught me so much about myself and i met some amazing people			0
’ @entity3 hopes her exhibition will show the world she is more than just a ‘ privileged ’ girl who likes to paint			1
she said : ‘ i am not in this for the fame , that is not important to me , but i would like people to see my paintings and realise how hard i work			0
i know i have had a very privileged life , but it is important to me i am not put in a box and am seen as more than the daughter of a famous singer			1
sometimes you hear people questioning why the children of actors and singers do n’t just get “ normal ” jobs			2
but when you grow up in an artistic environment , this is normal			2
‘ i also think it is in your genes			0
people are pleasantly surprised when they see that i am not a cliché and i take my work really seriously			0
i felt it was important for me to fly the nest and come to @entity7 on my own and be self - sufficient			2
’ but she has never felt she was in her mother ’s shadow			2
‘ i am so proud of what she has done in her life			0
i am so grateful to have such an incredible , passionate , giving person in my life			0
i was talking to her the other day about all her humanitarian work			0
she just never stops and does everything with the best of intentions			0
’ the singer plans to be at the opening of her daughter ’s exhibition			2
@entity3 said : ‘ she is my greatest inspiration and i am so glad she will be there			1
all those closest to me will be – which means a lot			0
’ @entity3 revealed she has also been taking acting lessons , saying : ‘ i love acting			1
it is similar to painting as you use yourself as the tool and it is scary because it all comes from within			0
to be successful you have to give your everything to it – so i do n’t think i could commit enough time just now with my art – but i have n’t ruled it out			2
’ wistfully , she adds : ‘ i ca n’t see myself in a comedy			0
i like things that are honest and raw , so i think the best acting is method acting for me			0
’ l the layers of life exhibition will be open for a month from march 19 at the @entity119 in @entity7 .			0
