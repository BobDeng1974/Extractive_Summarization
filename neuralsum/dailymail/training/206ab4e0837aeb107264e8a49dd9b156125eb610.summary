by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:00 pm on 7th july 2011 the devastated parents of a popular schoolboy found hanged in his bedroom told an inquest they believed his death could have been an @entity8 prank gone wrong			1
talented @entity9 , 15 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , was a keen practical joker and seemed perfectly happy on the evening of his death on march 31 this year , they said			1
in a statement read at the inquest in @entity10 , his mother , @entity17 , 47 , said she thought at first he had set up an elaborate hoax when she discovered him hanging in his room			1
suicide riddle : recording an open verdict , coroner @entity22 said nobody would ever know if @entity9 , pictured , meant to kill himself she said : ' i am more and more of the opinion that it is at least a possibility that this terrible tragedy was a practical run - through for an @entity8 's prank that had gone terribly , terribly wrong			1
' he just had to get out of bed to set up the prank			1
it would not have been a particularly funny prank , but it just does n't make sense to us , knowing what we do of his character , that he would take his own life			1
' knowing him as we did we know that his character did not match someone who would commit suicide			1
' she said she even believed the apparent suicide note he left was tongue in cheek because of its teasing tone			1
she said : ' he used the word ' dang '			1
he knew his father hates the word ' dang '			1
with his meticulous eye to the planning of his jokes he would have known this would have wound him up			2
' of course , we 're aware that this interpretation could be wrong			2
it is possible that we just can not come to terms with the fact he killed himself			2
' we 're trying to come to terms with the fact that we shall never know which of these these scenarios is correct			2
' mrs @entity17 said her son had been doing his maths homework in his bedroom upstairs when she went to his room to ask him to come down for supper			2
practical joker : @entity9 was found hanging in his bedroom			1
his parents think it was a prank that went wrong she said : ' my first reaction when i saw him was that he was teasing and to tell him to stop it			1
' i said ' stop it , come on			2
' then i touched him and it was clear from the movement of his body this was not a prank			2
' she said she had spoken to all @entity9 's friends and teachers at his school , @entity92 in @entity93 , and they all agreed he had never showed any signs of distress or depression before his death			1
she said : ' we had several visits from his school friends and they all found it hard to believe that he had taken this action himself			2
' he had been exactly the same when he left them that day as he normally was			2
he had been laughing , joking and happy			1
' his teacher said there was nothing different about him that day			0
' on the way home from school , she said @entity9 asked her advice about how to ask a girl out on a date without losing face , and said he was looking forward to a school fancy dress party			0
recording an open verdict , coroner @entity22 said nobody would ever know if @entity9 meant to kill himself			1
he said : ' i 'm left in exactly the same position as his parents , which is to take note of the evidence and to try to decide whether his death came about as a result of a definite attempt to end his life			1
' i believe this was a probable suicide but not a proven suicide			0
' as a father of a young daughter of about the same age , i ca n't begin to imagine what you as a family have gone through			0
you have all my sympathy			0
' speaking after the inquest , @entity9 's father @entity142 , 49 , an osteopath , said : ' we 'll never know for sure why he did it			0
he was a cheerful guy with loads of friends			0
' he was always very open with his emotions , and he did n't seem unhappy at all in the days before he died			0
' we will miss him forever			0
' almost 2,000 people joined a @entity151 tribute page which shows poignant videos of the teenager snowboarding , sitting on a beach and one of him and two friends giggling as they performed a choreographed dance routine which they put on @entity158			0
one friend wrote : ' out of the 6,000 million people on the earth , you deserved to die least			0
you will be missed by us forever			0
if only you knew how much we cared			0
' another wrote : ' everyone was shocked finding out , if only you could see			0
you should have been out partying with all your mates leaving school , having fun			0
' ' we really miss you @entity9 and we wish we could share school memories with you in 50 yrs time rest in peace and sleep tight @entity9			0
' @entity9 's headmaster @entity174 said : ' everyone at @entity92 has been extremely shocked and saddened			0
