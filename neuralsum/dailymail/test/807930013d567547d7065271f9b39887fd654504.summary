magistrates at @entity1 took just 15 minutes to find ms @entity2 not guilty a mother - of - two was locked in a police cells for six hours and put on bail for seven months before being put on trial for chopping back tree branches hanging over her garden			1
@entity2 appeared at @entity1 accused of causing criminal damage by pruning the tree , after a complaint was made by her next door neighbour @entity13 , as part of a long - running boundary dispute			1
but magistrates took just 15 minutes to find the 53 - year - old not guilty , saying that she had acted with good intentions			1
the court heard how council officials had told ms @entity2 that she could trim the tree near her home in @entity1 but physically refused to show her how much			1
however , the prosecution then told of how her pruning of the tree ' went way beyond the lawful excuse ' and caused ' unnecessary damage '			1
@entity27 , prosecuting , said that any trimming of a tree belonging to someone else could be criminal damage and that ms @entity2 had lawful excuse , which she had exceeded			1
he said : ' in july 2014 , @entity33 , a council mediator , visited ms @entity2 's home			1
' mr @entity33 told ms @entity2 she could cut overhanging branches back vertically and in line with the boundary but did not show the defendant what he meant			1
' there remains one disputed issue of fact and that 's the state of the tree before it was pruned			2
' @entity45 then told the court that before the tree had been cut last september , it was in a good condition but after she pruned it , ' it was terrible , all chopped back and dead			2
' however , @entity50 , mitigating , said the conifer had already been dying in the middle which had created a gap but the top of the tree was healthy			2
ms @entity2 confirmed to the court that she had a 90 - minute meeting with three council officials at her home last july			1
she said she asked mr @entity33 to demonstrate how to cut the branches as she ' did n't want to get in any trouble			0
' her daughter , @entity62 , also told the court mr @entity33 refused to show them because he ' did not have the time			2
' ms @entity2 went voluntarily to @entity67 police station in @entity1 following the complaint of criminal damage but said she had been reassured she would not be arrested			1
she added : ' i did n't have a solicitor with me so i feel i was coaxed in			0
' i went into the interview and the police read me my rights			0
i told them i could not understand what ' rights ' meant			0
' then the officer slammed his book shut and said : ' right , i am now going to arrest you '			0
' for all the scandal in @entity1 at the moment to think that the police and council have time , money and resources to waste on such a silly thing as a tree is disgusting			0
' mr and mrs @entity13 have refused to comment on the case			0
@entity91 , a senior district prosecutor with the @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 , said the incident followed an acrimonious eight - year long neighbour dispute			0
@entity2 , next to the hedge that she pruned , that ended up with her being locked in a police cell for six hours , put on bail for seven months and being put on trial for criminal damage ms @entity2 's neighbour @entity105			1
a complaint was made about the hedge as part of a long - running boundary dispute he said : ' the allegation was that the damage to the tree went well beyond pruning and that it had been hacked back to little more than a stump			2
' a caution was not available as no admissions to the offending were made and so the police took the decision to charge the suspect			0
' we respect the decision of the @entity123 and note that it made no criticism of our case			0
' under common law , you can cut back a branch from a tree that overhangs or encroaches on your property			0
the conifer hedge in this case formed the border between the gardens of @entity2 and her next door neighbours			2
at dispute was whether she had cut back too much of the hedge			0
the law allows a householder to carry out limited pruning from their own side			0
however they are not allowed to trespass on their neighbour â€™s property or alter the height of trees and hedges			0
the work must be carried out carefully to avoid damage or cause the tree to be unsafe			2
the prosecution was brought under a charge of criminal damage			1
this may have been because prosecutors considered the damage caused to the hedge was intentional and related to a neighbour dispute			2
@entity164 's housing and estate services manager @entity162 said the matter of the ' boundary hedge ' would normally have been discussed between neighbours but the ongoing dispute made this impossible			0
he said : ' ms @entity2 was provided with appropriate advice about what she could reasonably and legitimately do			1
' @entity172 and concise instructions were given and the officers did not leave until they were satisfied that those instructions were understood			0
ms @entity2 was also advised to act reasonably			1
' @entity91 , a senior district prosecutor with the @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 , said the incident over the hedge , pictured , followed an acrimonious eight - year long neighbour dispute the hedge in between ms @entity2 and mrs day 's homes			1
ms @entity2 went voluntarily to @entity67 police station in @entity1 following the complaint of criminal damage he said the decision to prosecute was made by the police and @entity92			1
while a @entity188 spokeswoman said the council had provided them with a statement that demonstrated that permission was not granted for the tree to be cut			0
she added : ' police received complaints about criminal damage that the complainants felt had been caused intentionally			1
' a thorough investigation was conducted that resulted in a woman being charged and brought before the courts			0

@entity2 appeared in court accused of causing criminal damage
came after she pruned neighbour 's tree that was hanging over her garden
