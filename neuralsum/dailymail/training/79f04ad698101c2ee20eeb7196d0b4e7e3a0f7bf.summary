we 've all bought a pair of shoes or a handbag without telling our spouses			1
but who buys a rainforest without sitting down at the kitchen table and having a discussion about it ? step forward @entity10 , wildlife documentary maker and husband of tv presenter @entity13			1
after getting a call from ' a mate in @entity16 ' , he parted with £ 6,000 to become the proud owner of 100 acres of some of the most unforgiving land on the planet , on the slopes of the @entity22 - a patch of land it was going to take him four flights , followed by an eight - hour drive , to reach			1
@entity10 parted with £ 6000 for 100 acres of land on the slopes of the @entity22 ' it certainly was n't going to be somewhere we 'd go on holiday and take the kids , ' he laughs			1
' no , it was purely a conservation project			1
because of where this land is situated , it was being used by illegal loggers to access the @entity41 and cut down trees			1
my mate @entity43 , who works out there in conservation , said if we bought it we could work with some of the agencies and build a guard station on the land - stopping the loggers			1
with hindsight i was quite naive			1
' what did @entity13 say when he finally told her about his purchase ? ' she thought i was mad			2
she saw my folly long before i did because she 's a conservation expert with a degree in environmental science , while i 've only got three gcses			2
but she was great about it , ultimately			2
i think she saw it was something i had to do			2
' the couple , who live in rural @entity64 and run their own tv production company , have three young sons - @entity68 , 13 , @entity69 , ten , and @entity70 , seven			2
@entity10 says the boys were thrilled at the idea of their father 's purchase			1
he did n't buy the land with a view to making a documentary about it , but when he finally went to @entity16 to see his land , he took the cameras with him			1
@entity10 and his wife @entity13 and their sons , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 the result is i bought @entity85 , and it 's much more gripping than you 'd expect a film about conservation to be			1
yes there are trees , and a lot of explanations about why they 're so important to the future of the planet			2
there are insects and snakes and glorious kingfishers , and startling footage of rare tribes like the @entity101			2
but in parts it 's more like an episode of @entity105 than a @entity107 documentary			2
one of the first discoveries @entity10 makes is that his land used to be owned by a man called @entity111 , who 'd been jailed for growing and processing coca , the plant cocaine is derived from			1
his son @entity114 was a drug runner with a fearsome reputation			2
' i 'd basically bought a cocaine plantation , ' says @entity10			1
' i was told i 'd bought the most dangerous piece of land off the most dangerous family in the most dangerous area of southern @entity16 , but it was too late			1
' he meets the men involved in the crop harvesting , who are ' smiley and friendly in the way narco traffickers apparently are before they kill you '			0
' it was also the biggest eye - opener			0
i 'd demonised these people , thinking they were all big guys with medallions and @entity133			0
but the more we heard about their situations , the more complicated it all became ' they agree to harvest their crop , however , and remove it from his land			1
@entity10 and @entity43 arm themselves with machetes while they wait for the harvesting team to arrive - only to find they 're women and children			1
surreally , he 's taught how to pick the leaves off the coca plants by a five - year - old girl			0
her seniors all chew the leaves as they work			0
' it was like a weird summer picnic , with drugs , ' he says			0
' it was also the biggest eye - opener			0
i 'd demonised these people , thinking they were all big guys with medallions and @entity133			0
but the more we heard about their situations , the more complicated it all became			0
' @entity10 and @entity43 eventually track down the supposed mr @entity164 responsible for the illegal logging on @entity10 's land			1
his name is @entity168 , and he says he 's just trying to feed his family			0
' i thought it was all a sob story but i went to his home and met his disabled daughter , and realised it was true			0
these people were n't the b * * * * * * s i 'd always blamed for destroying the @entity177 , they were just trying to survive			0
' although @entity168 agrees to work for him for payment - replanting the forest instead of logging it - @entity10 says he does n't feel he 'd saved the rainforest			1
' if anything it 's made me more depressed about the conservation issues involved			0
on a personal level it was the most brilliant - if terrifying - experience of my life			0
but i did n't come away with any answers			0
' in some ways , though , he was lucky to escape with his life because , having dodged drug barons and disgruntled locals , he returned to the @entity194 with a rare flesh - eating bug that hospitalised him			0
' no , that was n't part of the plan either , ' he admits			0
next he 's off to the @entity200 to take pictures for @entity202			0
this time @entity13 and the boys are coming too			0
' it 's going to be a very different job , ' he says , the relief evident			0
i bought a rainforest will be shown tomorrow at 8pm on @entity209 .			1

@entity10 paid £ 6000 for his land in the @entity22
@entity10 soon found that his land was being used to produce cocaine
the gripping series , i bought a @entity218 starts tomorrow on @entity209
