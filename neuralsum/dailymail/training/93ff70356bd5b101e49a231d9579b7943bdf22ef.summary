looking uncannily like an @entity2 pyramid , it is not something you would expect to see on the surface of @entity6			0
@entity9 engineers were so intrigued by the unique , football sized rock , they have driven the @entity12 up to it for a closer rock			1
the football - size rock will be the first on @entity6 to be examined by rover 's robotic arm			1
it will be the first test for @entity12 's robot arm which contains several analysis instruments			1
@entity9 has named the rock after the late engineer @entity25 , who was the surface operations systems chief engineer for @entity26 and the project 's @entity12			1
he passed away on august 20th , at age 64			0
@entity25 also was a leading engineer for all of the previous @entity9 @entity6 rovers : @entity30			0
curiosity is about 8 feet ( 2.5 meters ) from the rock			2
it lies about halfway from the rover 's landing site , @entity36 , to a location called @entity38			2
the team plans to touch the rock with a spectrometer to determine its elemental composition and use an arm - mounted camera to take close - up photographs			1
both the arm - mounted @entity45 and the mast - mounted , laser - zapping @entity46 and @entity47 will be used for identifying elements in the rock			1
@entity9 hopes this will give them a new insight into the structure of the red planet , and also allow cross-checking of the two instruments			0
the rock has been named ' @entity57 ' after a @entity9 employee who recently passed away			2
it has previously renamed the rover 's landing site as ' @entity36 ' after the late sci - fi author ray @entity36 curiosity now has driven for six days in a row			1
@entity66 distances range from 72 feet to 121 feet ( 22 meters to 37 meters )			0
' this robot was built to rove , and the team is really getting a good rhythm of driving day after day when that 's the priority , " said @entity26 project manager @entity67 of @entity9 's @entity68 in @entity69			1
the team plans to choose a rock in the @entity38 area for the rover 's first use of its capability to analyze powder drilled from interiors of rocks			1
three types of terrain intersect in the @entity38 area -- one lighter - toned and another more cratered than the terrain curiosity currently is crossing			2
the light - toned area is of special interest because it retains daytime heat long into the night , suggesting an unusual composition			2
' as we 're getting closer to the light - toned area , we see thin , dark bands of unknown origin , ' said @entity94 scientist @entity93 of the @entity95 , @entity69			2
the route driven by @entity9 's @entity12 since it landed on the @entity6			1
the @entity38 area farther east is the mission 's first major science destination			2
' the smaller - scale diversity is becoming more evident as we get closer , providing more potential targets for investigation			0
' researchers are using @entity12 's @entity105 ( @entity106 ) to find potential targets on the ground			1
recent new images from the rover 's camera reveal dark streaks on rocks in the @entity38 area that have increased researchers ' interest in the area			2
in addition to taking ground images , the camera also has been busy looking upward			0
on two recent days , @entity12 pointed the @entity106 at the sun and recorded images of @entity6 ' two moons , @entity123 , passing in front of the sun from the rover 's point of view			1
results of these transit observations are part of a long - term study of changes in the moons ' orbits			0
@entity9 's twin @entity135 , which arrived at @entity6 in 2004 , also have observed solar transits by @entity6 ' moons			0
opportunity is doing so again this week			0
this mosaic from the @entity105 on @entity9 's @entity12 rover shows a close - up view looking toward the " @entity38 " area , where three different terrain types come together , and where @entity12 is headed			1
' @entity144 is in an orbit very slowly getting closer to @entity6 , and @entity146 is in an orbit very slowly getting farther from @entity6 , ' said @entity12 's science team co-investigator @entity148 of @entity150 , @entity151			1
' these observations help us reduce uncertainty in calculations of the changes			0
' in @entity12 's observations of @entity144 this week , the time when the edge of the moon began overlapping the disc of the sun was predictable to within a few seconds			1
uncertainty in timing is because @entity6 ' interior structure is n't fully understood			0
@entity144 causes small changes to the shape of @entity6 in the same way @entity170 's moon raises tides			0
the changes to @entity6 ' shape depend on the @entity6 interior which , in turn , cause @entity144 ' orbit to decay			0
timing the orbital change more precisely provides information about @entity6 ' interior structure			0
during @entity12 's two - year prime mission , researchers will use the rover 's 10 science instruments to assess whether the selected field site inside @entity185 ever has offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life			1
the curiosity rover observes the @entity189 grazing the sun 's disk on @entity6 day , or sol , 37 ( september 13 , 2012 )			0

football sized rock will be the first test for @entity12 's robot arm
@entity199 will touch the rock with a spectrometer to determine its elemental composition and use an arm - mounted camera to take close - up photographs
