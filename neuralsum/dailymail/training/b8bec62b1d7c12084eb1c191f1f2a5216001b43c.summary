@entity0 and the @entity1 are to set up a joint ‘ cyber squad ’ to carry out fake hacking attacks on banks , aircraft and nuclear power plants			1
in talks at the @entity10 today , @entity7 and @entity8 are set to agree an unprecedented level of co-operation , with a team of agents to help safeguard both countries			1
a report from @entity0 spy chiefs to be published today says four in every five big firms in the @entity0 last year experienced some sort of serious cyber security breach			1
there is mounting concern that @entity41 fundamentalists or an enemy country could seek to mount a crippling attack on @entity45 banks , sensitive sites such as atomic power plants or even planes , by targeting air traffic control systems			1
in the wake of @entity52 ’s attack on @entity53 , @entity0 and @entity1 security services will now establish a joint team of agents to confront the issue and respond to attacks			1
agents at @entity60 and @entity61 will work with their @entity1 counterparts to encourage information about threats to be shared at a greater pace			1
they will also conduct a series of ‘ war games ’ to test the resilience of both the @entity0 and @entity1 in the face of cyber attacks			1
the first exercise will simulate an attack on the financial sector , for example on banks in the @entity77 and @entity78 , and will take place later this year			0
this will be followed by further ‘ war games ’ to test critical national infrastructure – likely to include air traffic control , power stations and healthcare systems			1
the pair appeared to be in good spirits as they chatted before settling down to business mr @entity7 and mr @entity8 are pictured inside the @entity24 moments after the prime minister was invited inside the leaders ' discussions were undertaken last night during a ' working dinner '			2
judging by the menu , it looks to have been one of mr @entity7 's more enjoyable duties			0
the @entity1 and @entity0 have also agreed to align cybersecurity standards to ensure multinational firms receive consistent advice on keeping their systems safe from cyber attack			1
the two countries will train up a new generation of ‘ cyber agents ’ and allow the brightest experts on both sides of the @entity109 to carry out research placements for up to six months			2
mr @entity7 , who began two days of talks at the @entity10 last night , said : ‘ just as we have worked with our closest ally , the @entity1 , to protect our people and our countries from traditional threats , so we must work together to defend ourselves from new threats like cyber attacks			1
‘ this is an evolving threat which poses a real risk to our businesses and that ’s why we ’re taking our cooperation with the @entity1 to an unprecedented level			1
‘ this is about pooling our effort so we stay one step ahead of those who seek to attack us			0
’ today ’s report from @entity60 reveals the growing scale of the threat , with more than 80 per cent of large firms in the @entity0 reporting some form of security breach last year , at a total cost of between £ 600,000 and £ 1.5million			1
director @entity136 said : ‘ in @entity60 , we continue to see real threats to the @entity0 on a daily basis , and i ’m afraid the scale and rate shows little sign of abating			1
’ @entity60 is urging all businesses to take greater steps to protect themselves from cyber attacks			1
on a daily basis , its agents see computer systems and the information on them being compromised by malicious attackers			2
the report says : ' the internet can be a hostile environment			2
the threat of attack is ever present as new vulnerabilities are released and commodity tools are produced to exploit them			0
' doing nothing is no longer an option ; protect your organisation and your reputation by establishing some basic cyber defences to ensure that your name is not added to the growing list of victims			0
' the report gives examples of attacks identified by @entity60 , including a previously unknown espionage campaign against the @entity0 energy sector			1
the world was shaken after @entity52 's apparent hack of @entity53 , which made @entity175 ( above ) @entity7 last night urged @entity8 to help create a rapid response team of specialists to stamp out outbreaks of ebola and other deadly diseases before they can spread across the world			0
over dinner in the @entity10 , the two leaders were updated on the latest infection rates in @entity185			2
they also discussed the idea of having a standing army of epidemiologists who could be deployed quickly to any area of the world – to assess emerging epidemics and offer swift advice about how to overcome them			0
attackers used a technique known as a ‘ watering hole ’ attack to distribute ' malware ' - malicious softward - into businesses working in the energy sector			0
after discovering that a single web design company hosted a number of energy supply sector businesses ’ websites , attackers added a code to one website which redirected the visiting user ’s browser to one of three websites controlled by the attackers			0
@entity60 believe that these watering hole attacks were part of a continuing commercial espionage campaign against the @entity0 energy sector			1
fortunately , agents detected the attack and was dealt with before it could affect the targeted businesses			2
in another attack , a technique called ' spear - phishing ' was used to attack a high profile organisation			0
an email was sent to a targeted individual containing an attachment with malicious software			0
the attacker was then able to access information about the company 's wider network and sensitive informatiob			0
the report says attackers range from cyber criminals interested in making money through fraud or sale of valuable information to industrial competitors and foreign intelligence services , interested in gaining an economic advantage for their companies or countries			0
in other cases , ' hacktivists ' may seek to attack companies for political or ideological motives , or just to show they can			0
the worst case scenario would be a rogue state or terrorists using cyber attacks as a form of warfare			0
chief executive of cyber firm @entity259 said : ' the growing frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks underlines that we are in a new era of cyber-security			0
' unfortunately the old systems just do n’t work , whether that ’s individual countries trying to deal with the cyber threat alone or whether it ’s organisations thinking they can keep intruders out of their networks			2
' countries need to work more closely together , governments need to work more openly with the business world and companies need to be able to detect unusual patterns of behaviour on their networks and address them before a breach becomes a crisis			2

leaders set to agree unprecedented level of co-operation in @entity287
agents from @entity60 and @entity61 will work with their counterparts in the @entity1
' war games ' will test resilience of air traffic control and health systems
