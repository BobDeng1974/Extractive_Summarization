by @entity1 reporter last updated at 9:07 pm on 23rd december 2011 nightmares of snowstorms and flight cancellations are more common than visions of sugarplums around this time of year			2
but luckily the weather seems to be helping the millions of holiday travellers by causing few delays as people head out to visit family over @entity12 weekend			1
as of thursday evening , there was nothing to indicate any widespread weather disruptions at the beginning of the @entity12 travel period			1
little to fear : while there may be some snow - related problems in @entity21 and @entity22 , the only other area is between @entity23 and @entity24 where wind and fog may be an issue winter wonderland : snow in @entity30 is n't causing problems for travellers , but is a nice backdrop for a white @entity12 @entity34 only listed @entity23 , @entity24 , and @entity35 as potentially risky airports , and even those weather warnings were limited to low clouds , rain , light snow and wind			1
road travel warnings are listed in @entity43 , the @entity44 of @entity24 , the i - 25 spanning from @entity46 to @entity21 , and the @entity22 panhandle			1
heavy snow did force the cancellation of more than 100 flights thursday at @entity51 , one of the nation 's busiest , but that tapered off by thursday evening			2
keep an eye out : limited snow ( white ) , wind ( purple ) and floods ( light blue ) are the only problems severe thunderstorms are forecast today in the southeast part of the country , while snow falls in the mountains of @entity68			1
mountainous areas of @entity70 and @entity68 were expected to get several inches of snow by friday morning , and rain and thunderstorms were forecast down the coast to the @entity75			1
these unexpectedly pleasant weather warnings come a year after much of the @entity77 was completely shut down from a massive pre-christmas snowstorm			2
talk about changing times : the holidays last year ( shown left in @entity81 ) were filled with snow as compared to this year ( right , @entity83 ) where much of the country is left brown and dry the relatively - sunny outlook is good news as more americans are expected to take long trips this holiday season			1
about 92 million people will travel 50 miles or more from friday through jan. 2 , an increase of 1.4 per cent more than last year , according to @entity92			2
hit the skies : up to 92 million - more people than ever - are scheduled to travel by air this holiday season the federation of motor clubs said 90 percent will travel by car			1
drivers will find gasoline prices higher than last year , but well below this year 's peaks			0
air travel will be down about 10 per cent			2
airlines have trimmed the number of flights and are packing planes fuller than ever before			0
that means if something goes wrong , there are fewer options to rebook stranded passengers			0
there are just no spare seats			0
bad weather also can mean more cancellations than in the past			0
a @entity118 rule that went into effect in april 2010 limits planes to three hours on the tarmac			0
airlines that violate it face penalties of up to $ 27,500 per person â€” that 's more than $ 3.7million for just one @entity128			0
that has made them skittish about operating in bad weather , leading to 20 per cent more cancellations in the typical month			0
taking flight : one little traveller at @entity135 's @entity134 was probably excited at the lack of delays			0
