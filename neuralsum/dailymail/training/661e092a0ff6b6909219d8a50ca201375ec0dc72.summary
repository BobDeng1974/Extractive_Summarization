' these numbers put us right on track for our goal of half a million applicants			0
' they have been inundated with applications from all over the globe , and now must start sifting through the files in order to figure out who will be among in the group of candidates who proceed to the reality show round of the competition , where they will be whittled down to an even - smaller group of four finalists			1
