' the vanilla ice cream center is coated with a crispy chocolate wafer , ' chef and owner @entity8 explained of the $ 7 @entity19			1
' then the outside - a mixture between marshmallow and ice cream - is caramelized , with the ice cream still frozen inside ' frozen s'more : @entity8 unveiled its latest creation this morning , a new take on another @entity14 classic : the s'more the torched - to - order , square - shaped dessert is a gooey hybrid of homemade marshmallow and dondurma , a stretchy @entity34 ice cream			1
' i was inspired by a trip to @entity37 , ' said mr @entity8			1
' i had the chance to try dondurma , the texture is very chewy but it 's still frozen			2
i wanted to make something similar			2
' the recipe - with its crackling surface , soft and silky marshmallow inside , and core of vanilla ice cream covered in a layer of crunchy wafer - took a week to perfect			1
@entity49 touches : the torched - to - order square - shaped dessert is a gooey hybrid of homemade marshmallow and dondurma , a stretchy @entity34 ice cream ( pictured , chef @entity8 ) but rather than serving the @entity58 on a plate or in a cone , the chef wanted to come up something ' fun ' - an applewood - smoked skewer made from a willow branch			1
' you ca n't taste it , but you can smell it			0
it reminds me of campfires when you toast marshmallows , ' mr @entity8 explained			1
' the @entity71 are different , i wanted to give people a unique and special experience			1
' they 're all made - to - order , you have just a few minutes to eat it on the spot			0

' always fresh : ' they 're all made to order , you have just a few minutes to eat it on the spot , ' says the chef after the success of the @entity3 - which was quietly unveiled on may 10 with a small batch of 50 , and by may 13 , had sold out of 200 by 9.30am - the @entity85 chef said business is booming			2
' we definitely increased business to meet the demands of customers , to serve them the best we can every morning , ' he said			0
but he has no plans to open another store , despite the hundreds of customers - including @entity97 - who continue to wait in line for hours for a chance to try the @entity3			0
pastry inventor : ' i think about creating new things every day , i never stop creating and coming up with ideas			0
i 've always pushed myself to do something new ' said mr @entity8 @entity10 gem : the bakery opened in @entity7 in 2011 , and is located at 189 @entity107 ' any good business should expand and grow , but i want to take time and do things slowly , i want to keep the standard and quality high , ' he said			1
so what is the next big thing ? ' this is the next big thing ! ' mr @entity8 laughed			2
' i think about it every day though , i never stop creating and coming up with ideas			0
i 've always pushed myself to do something new			0
