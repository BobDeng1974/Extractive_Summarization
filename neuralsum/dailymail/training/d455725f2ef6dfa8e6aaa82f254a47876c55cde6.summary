by @entity0 this bizarre @entity2 footage shows a pair of thieves stealing a sacred cow - by forcing it bottom - first into the back seat of their tiny hatchback and driving off with it			1
watch out ! the unsuspecting cow wanders over to the car and is spotted by the passenger the incident happened in @entity15 , @entity16 , where cow slaughter is illegal , but these two thieves did not seem to care as they crammed the poor creature into their vehicle to take home for food			2
initially , the cow does not seem to out up much of a fight - it wanders over to the car of its own accord before one of the opportunists seizes it two minutes into the video			0
it begins to struggle as it is pushed into the back seat bottom - first , and at one point manages to force the door back open with its head , before giving up the fight			1
with their catch trapped , the getaway drivers sets off , and the cow 's main assailant jumps into the moving vehicle as it tears off down the road			0
the theft appears to have taken place on a small farm on @entity51 in @entity52 - a large neighbourhood in south @entity15			0
@entity54 of cattle has been illegal in @entity56 - the region where @entity15 is - since 1976 , though consumption of beef is not banned			0
gotcha : the cow falls for the bait and peers head first into the back seat escape : the man jumps into the moving vehicle and the pair make their getaway			1
