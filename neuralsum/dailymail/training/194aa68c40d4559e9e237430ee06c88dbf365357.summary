sir @entity0 nearly quit football four years before he won the @entity2 for @entity3 - to play cricket			1
sir @entity0 , 72 , was on the verge of hanging up his footie boots to become a wicket - keeper and batsman , he has revealed			1
he says he loved cricket so much he used to regularly miss pre-season training with @entity12 at a young age to bat and bowl			1
bat and ball : @entity3 @entity2 hero sir @entity0 almost gave up football because of his passion for cricket 1966 : captain @entity21 , carried shoulder high by his team mates , holding aloft the @entity2 trophy			1
@entity3 defeated @entity25 4 - 2 in the final , played at @entity28 's @entity27 sir @entity0 , the only man to score a hat - trick in a @entity30 , says his heroes as a boy were n't footballers - but cricket legends like @entity35			1
he says he was good enough to play for the @entity36 and even for the full county - until @entity12 boss @entity38 moved him from midfielder to a striker			1
the star went on to score hundreds of goals including 228 for his club , and key strikes at the @entity2 against @entity25 and @entity45			1
sir @entity0 , who now lives in @entity46 , @entity47 , said : ' i was detrimental to both sports playing football and cricket			1
' at the top level to be good enough to play the sport you have to be dedicated to doing that thing			1
' i enjoyed playing football and cricket and it came to a time in my late teens and early 20s when i say i was " messing about with both sports "			2
' four years before the 1966 @entity2 i was still playing more cricket than football			2
i thought my future probably lay with cricket ' ' it was the end of an era where people like @entity35 and @entity68 were playing football and cricket internationally for @entity3			2
how does that work ? ' playing cricket was to the detriment of my football			2
i was playing cricket until september , even october each year while it was still light in the evenings			2
' then i was coming back to @entity12 having missed all the pre-season training and half - a - dozen league games and i was struggling as a footballer			1
' then @entity38 decided that he would move me from midfield to playing up front			2
i came back from playing cricket and on the first monday we played @entity84			2
' i was n't fit and as i was struggling in the middle of the park then @entity38 put me up front			2
we played @entity88 and won 1 - 0 in my first game up there			1
' i came off the pitch and it was like my shorts had been dipped in water because i was that unfit			0
' but it worked out and in that first season i played 27 games and scored 14 goals from a standing start			0
' nowadays if you pay Â£ 50million and someone gets 14 goals in 27 games it 's seen as the best buy you 've ever seen			0
' i look back on my career and appreciate how quickly and how dramatically it rose , once i decided to fully commit to football			0
' four years before the 1966 @entity2 i was still playing more cricket than football			0
i thought my future probably lay with cricket			0
' in 1962 i decided to stay behind while @entity12 went on a tour to @entity112 to play cricket for @entity36 seconds - that was just four years before the @entity2 final ' there was n't a decision to choose between the two sports			1
it 's just that the football took off at a senior level quicker than the cricket			0
' had i played more games for @entity36 in the first team than i did - i played one but never really had more of a chance - i may have ended up choosing cricket			1
i never officially made that decision			0
' the next season i was the top scorer , then in ' 64 we won the @entity132 , in ' 65 we won the @entity133 and then everyone knows what happened in ' 66			0
sir @entity0 the hat - trick scoring hero of the 1966 @entity2 final and the other goal scorer @entity138 sir @entity0 also began playing sports with another footballer - sir @entity21 - but rather than football , the first competitive game they took part in was cricket			1
luckily for @entity3 though , @entity21 decided much earlier on in life that he would solely focus on football , going on to win the @entity2 on that fateful night in 1966			0
' @entity21 was the best i ever played with , ' @entity0 said			1
' he had such a great football brain and was so determined and focused			0
' he was so composed in the big games and big moments			0
he was able to be as relaxed playing in a @entity2 final as he was playing in a five - aside on a sunday morning			1
' his ability to read the game was fantastic			0
his ability to take on and pass the ball out of defence was excellent			0
my third goal in the final showed that			0
' we played together at football and cricket together for @entity164 schools but he focused on football from an earlier age than i did			0

sir @entity0 was on the verge of hanging up boots to become a wicket - keeper
he regularly missed pre-season training with @entity12 to bat and bowl
sir @entity0 , 72 , says he was good enough to play for the @entity36
