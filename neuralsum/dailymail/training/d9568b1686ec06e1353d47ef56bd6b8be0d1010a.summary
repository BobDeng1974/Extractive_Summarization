now the car , which she relies on to get to work , is a write - off , lying at the bottom of the pit , which stretches 15ft across the family 's driveway – to within inches of the house itself			1
miss @entity40 's stepfather @entity52 , said : ' we had n't heard anything at all			2
there was no indication whatsoever			2
' at 7am my daughter went out the front door and instead of her car being there , there was a huge hole			1
the first thing i did was phone the police because we did n't know what to do			2
' we were n't absolutely sure the car was in there but it seemed too much of a coincidence for it not to be			2
' the doomed @entity26 at the bottom of the crevice belonged to teenager @entity40 ( stock picture ) the giant hole is about 15ft in diameter and 30ft deep and appeared in the drive just feet away from the wall of the house the wet weather in december and january may have caused the hole , at the house by eroding earth used to fill in the old clay , stone and chalk pits mr @entity52 , 59 , an environmental consultant , said the police called firefighters to the house in @entity32 , @entity33 , to secure the area			1
watch manager @entity90 said : ' we get a few calls of this nature , mainly in the south of the county			0
historically , holes have appeared in the area due to clay mining			0
' writing about mining in the area on a community website , a local historian explained : ' earlier inhabitants of @entity103 and @entity32 made a living by digging on the @entity105 and in the fields – digging for clay to make bricks , for chalk to make agricultural lime and for stone to shape as building and road making materials			1
' the records show this going back from the 1950s to the early 1800s , and such activity may have started many years before that			0
' it is thought the recent wet weather may have caused the hole to open up by eroding earth used to fill in the old pits			1
now local building inspectors are assessing whether the property is secure			0
mr @entity52 hopes it will be because there was no structural damage to the property which he believes was built on a concrete raft to safeguard against sinkholes			0
mr @entity52 added : ' the real shock of all this is the horror of what might have been had @entity40 gone out and been inside it when it sank			0
it overtakes all other concerns			0
' all you can see is part of the side of the car and it 's filled with mud			1

@entity146 swallowed @entity26 after opening *suddenly* in *middle* of night
the wet weather in december and january may have caused the hole
the ground *underneath* was once chalk pits and has since been filled in
