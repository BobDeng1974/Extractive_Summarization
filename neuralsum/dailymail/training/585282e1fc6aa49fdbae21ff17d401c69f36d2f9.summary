@entity5 was given pint after pint of blood over a 12 - hour period as doctors battled to save her life following the surgery to help correct a rare heart defect			1
her mother @entity13 , 33 , could only look on helplessly as her desperately ill eight - month - old daughter fought for her life in hospital			1
a little fighter : @entity5 , with her mother @entity18 , who was saved by over 30 transfusions but yesterday @entity5 was recovering at home with her family as her mother thanked all the blood donors who had helped to keep her baby alive			1
mrs @entity5 said : ‘ that blood saved my daughter ’s life			2
she had 30 blood transfusions in 12 hours			1
if the blood was not there in that hospital at that time she would not have survived			0
’ she said the doctors at @entity33 in @entity34 did an incredible job in repairing the bleed in @entity5 ’s heart and never once gave up			2
she said : ‘ i ’m just so grateful , i want everyone to give blood			0
i will forever be in the debt of @entity33			0

her condition was first spotted in the womb			0
doctors warned her mother that @entity5 might die during childbirth – or if she lived , it might not be for long due to the massive defect			0
mummy 's little fighter : @entity42 has a congenital heart defect but they had n’t reckoned on @entity5 ’s sheer will to live and have described her as a ‘ survivor ’ and a ‘ tough cookie ’			1
