comedian @entity0 lists his top tips for students on surviving @entity3 moving out of home for the first time to go to university is a big leap and there are hundreds of books out there teaching you how to boil an egg or pay a tv licence			1
but those guides never tell you the real need - to - know tips for surviving the first term			1
did you know that you will never buy enough loo roll ? or that no one wants to be friends with the person where a university logo sweater ? so @entity24 has enlisted stand - up comedian , @entity27 regular and @entity26 graduate @entity0 to provide the full low - down on getting through @entity3			1
1 ) plan your living arrangements early … but not too early : if you 're living in dorms for your first year , you will have automatically been allocated a bunch of people to hate the smell of and argue about washing up with for the next year , so do n't worry			1
but when the time comes to get yourself a house , you need to be quick ! make sure you get bunked up with people you like , do n't be stuck in a two bedroom below ground floor flat with the guy who breathes loudly at the back of lectures			1
but for heaven 's sake do n't ask people about second year housing too early , that 's like proposing on the first date ; ' can i borrow a pen please mate ? ' , ' lets live together ! ' 2 ) buy lots of toilet roll : seriously , you can never have too much bog roll			1
this will be the first time you have lived on your own			1
i know the loo roll just magically regenerates in @entity58 and @entity60 's house , but seriously , it basically evaporates in a shared house … be prepared , no one wants to wipe their a * * * on a @entity63			1
3 ) make friends with the guys at the student union : yes , this sounds creepy			1
yes , some of the people who work there will be about 50 years old			2
but you can never underestimate the favours that can be pulled by a mate at the student union			2
forgot to get tickets to that cool band ? student union mate will help			2
they are only accepting vouchers for drinks and you lost all of yours ? student union mate will help			2
need a body moved ? well … you 've gone too far mate			2
students are warned to avoid microwaving smelly foods and stick to takeaway meals instead 4 ) do n't microwave stuff that stinks : no matter where you are			1
just because you are hungry , does n't mean you need to fumigate the entire house with the smell of your second course leftovers			2
if you need to eat in hurry … you know that massive pile of stuff that makes it hard to open your front door ? those are takeaway menus			2
5 ) never wear a jumper depicting the university name : do n't			1
people at @entity106 will hate you			0
people outside @entity106 will hate you			0
you are not in @entity109			0
comedian @entity0 has suggested all students avoid playing extreme frisbee as it is the sport of imbecile 6 ) do not play @entity114 : @entity114 is the sport of the imbecile			1
it says ' hey ! are you a bit too clumsy to play football ? but not big enough to play rugby ? got no musical talent , or any talent at all to speak of generally ? do you need to get out there and ruin peoples days out in the park ? ' run , fetch , and catch like a big stupid @entity127 on a saturday afternoon with all of your other big stupid @entity127 friends … play @entity114			0
release your inner big stupid @entity127 today ' 7 ) have stock excuses for being late : ' sorry , i missed the bus ' is the worst			0
do n't be that guy			0
be the guy who comes in late and spins a yarn @entity135 himself would be proud of			0
or simply confuse the lecturer into submitting			0
my mate once used the excuse ' sorry i 'm late , i fell over ' … it was amazing			0
the lecturer had never heard something so stupid in her life , therefore , it had to be true			0
@entity0 advises that students use normal condoms instead of those that are @entity3 - week branded 8 ) use condoms : this may seem like the most obvious one on this list , but it 's not			1
@entity151 condoms yes , but do not use the ones they give out on fresher 's week			0
firstly , it just looks weird			0
you get that ready for action and you are basically saying ' i 've been dying to use this ! ' but even worse , if you whip that bad boy out in your second year , and blow the dust off it , you 're going to look like you were keeping it as a souvenir 9 ) do n't be a d * * * : as in @entity106 , as in life			0
enjoy your ' education ' @entity0 embarks on an extension of his nationwide tour with his stand - up show @entity0 : the most dangerous man on saturday morning television on october 1st			1
