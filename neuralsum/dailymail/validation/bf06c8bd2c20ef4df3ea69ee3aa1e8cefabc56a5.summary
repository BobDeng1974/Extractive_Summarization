the evidence for @entity1 once being habitable is steadily growing , as samples collected by @entity4 ’s @entity3 have revealed a key ingredient for life in @entity1 rock			1
scientists found traces of nitrogen compounds known as nitrates , a vital source of nutrients for living things on @entity15			1
the discovery is the latest feather in the cap for the theory that while @entity1 is barren and dry now , it was once habitable			2
@entity4 scientists in @entity21 found evidence of nitrogen on @entity1			1
findings were made by @entity3 's ( shown ) @entity25 at @entity1 instrument			1
the scientists found nitrates - a source of nitrogen for life on @entity15			1
it was likely created by asteroid impacts or lightning in volcanic plumes the findings were published in the journal @entity36			1
in their paper , the team of researchers said the nitrogen could indicate the first stage of a primitive nitrogen cycle on the surface of ancient @entity1			2
this could have provided a biochemically accessible source of nitrogen for life on @entity1			2
the @entity15 ’s nitrogen - rich atmosphere made life possible , but the origins of the air we breathe have long been a mystery			1
now , scientists believe they have found the answer : that tectonic forces responsible for creating mountains and volcanoes , also made the atmosphere habitable			2
geoscientists studied tectonic chemistry and found that nitrogen started building up in @entity15 ’s atmosphere three billion years ago			2
writing in the journal @entity66 , @entity67 researchers explained in october 2014 that the chemistry of the air we breathe is the result of billions of years of photosynthesis , as well as tectonic activity			0
while scientists knew that plant life was responsible for the build up of oxygen , which makes up one fifth of the @entity15 ’s atmosphere , the nitrogen content - which accounts for 80 per cent of air - had remained a mystery			1
‘ discovery of indigenous martian nitrogen in @entity1 surface materials has important implications for habitability and , specifically , for the potential evolution of a nitrogen cycle at some point in martian history , ’ they wrote			0
the latest evidence was found by using the @entity92 at @entity1 ( @entity94 ) instrument on the @entity95 ( @entity95 ) , more commonly known as @entity3			1
the discoveries were made at areas of @entity1 known as @entity98 and @entity99			0
the scientists note that this particular nitrate likely resulted from an asteroid impact , or lightning in a volcanic plume			2
nitrogen is a key component of things like @entity108 , @entity109 and amino acids , and thus important for life			0
nitrates themselves are important because they are a good source of nitrogen for living things			0
the next step will be to see if nitrates are still being produced on @entity1			0
‘ people want to follow the carbon , but in many ways nitrogen is just as important a nutrient for life , ’ said dr @entity118 , a science team member for the @entity95 , reported @entity124			0
‘ life runs on nitrogen as much as it runs on carbon			0
’ shown is @entity3 's @entity25 at @entity1 instrument			1
in their paper the team of researchers said the nitrogen could indicate the first stage of a primitive nitrogen cycle on the surface of ancient @entity1			0
this could have provided a biochemically accessible source of nitrogen for life on @entity1 this follows news in december 2014 when the rover identified spikes of methane that scientists believe may have come from bacteria - like organisms on the surface			1
' this temporary increase in methane - sharply up and then back down - tells us there must be some relatively localised source , ' said @entity152 of the @entity153 , @entity154 , and @entity3 science team , at the time			2
' there are many possible sources , biological or non-biological , such as interaction of water and rock			0
' previous satellite observations have detected unusual plumes of methane on the planet			0
but none of these previous readings are as extraordinary as the sudden ' venting ' measured at @entity168 , where evidence suggests water once flowed billions of years ago			0
curiosity landed in the 96 mile - wide ( 154km ) crater in august 2012 and has been exploring the region ever since			0
since it landed , conclusive evidence has been found that @entity1 once had water on its surface , and now scientists are hoping to provide an answer once and for all to the greatest question : was there , or is there still , life on @entity1 as well ?			1

@entity4 scientists in @entity21 found evidence of nitrogen on @entity1
findings were made by @entity3 's @entity25 at @entity1 instrument
the scientists found nitrates - a source of nitrogen for life on @entity15
it was likely created by asteroid impacts or lightning in volcanic plumes
increases evidence that the red planet was once habitable in its past
