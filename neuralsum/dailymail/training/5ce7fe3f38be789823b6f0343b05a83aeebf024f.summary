by @entity0 the rocketing rise of budget @entity3 supermarket @entity5 continues , with price - busting groceries the least of it			1
not content with luring bargain - conscious middle - class shoppers away from the bigger supermarkets with cut - price lobster , champagne and posh deli hams , they ’ve also entered the worlds of fashion and beauty			1
three years ago , their £ 4 perfume suddenly madame @entity17 outshone @entity21 ’s £ 61 @entity20 in a trial			1
then last year , beauty experts raved over the brand ’s £ 1.99 bb cream			2
until now the supermarket has limited itself to basic underwear and vests			2
but today the brand ’s @entity30 range — boasting jeans , shirts , knitwear and a stand - out ‘ leather ’ jacket for £ 15 — arrives in all 600 stores nationwide			1
described as ‘ more current and on - trend , as much about quality as affordability , ’ @entity5 say it is ‘ a natural progression for us ’			1
natural for @entity5 , maybe , but for its shoppers ? as a 50 - year - old woman keen on a bargain , i decided to find out			1
but this jumper is not so much roomy as shapeless , exacerbated by the unflattering slash neckline			0
while there is nothing wrong with clothing that is cheap , it must n’t look cheap			0
however , the denim skirt is pleasingly faded			0
the fit is good , and while too short for me to wear bare - legged , i ’d happily team it with a polo neck , tights and boots for autumn / winter			0
sophisticated chiffon for only £ 5.99 skirt £ 5.99 , chiffon blouse £ 5.99 at first glance , this outfit looks promising : the £ 5.99 skirt has a trendy abstract print and the silky shirt looks like it costs far more than £ 5.99			1
when on , it ’s a different story			0
the skirt looks as if it would lose all shape in the seat with just a few wears			0
but the shirt has possibilities			0
@entity5 describes it as chiffon , but it ’s very definitely synthetic , not silk			1
yet it hangs well and feels quite pleasant			0
the tiny buttons are fiddly , but at this incredible price , how picky can you be ? hate the jeans , love the shirt maroon jeans £ 6.99 , denim shirt £ 5.99 these jeans are available in grey , blue wash , navy or maroon and presumably are all as horrid as each other			1
the shape could not flatter anyone , and they quickly become slack in all the wrong places			0
not a patch on @entity106 ’s excellent range of jeans			2
but the soft denim shirt is a real find			0
i expected the fabric to gather in bulging folds , and i was wrong			0
once on , it becomes apparent how well - tailored the fitted shape is , with no unsightly gaping at the cleavage			0
brilliant £ 14.99 biker jacket £ 14.99 , jeans £ 6.99 , blouse £ 5.99 without any doubt , the absolute star of @entity5 ’s range is this biker - style jacket that costs an astonishing £ 14.99			1
no , you would never mistake it for leather , but not many will spot that it is 100 per cent viscose			2
yes , i ’ll be running out to buy it today			2
but the jeans ? the £ 6.99 price tag does n’t look such a bargain once they ’re on			1
they achieve the trick previously unique to @entity136 ’s clothes — both too big and too small at the same time			2
the verdict try to pair almost any piece from the range with another and you run into a problem — head - to - toe @entity5 is not a great look			2
but we have long learned to mix and match budget fashion gems such as the biker jacket			0
and the white chiffon blouse , denim skirt and denim shirt are all useful staples at an extraordinary price .			1

@entity30 range boasts jeans , shirts , knitwear and a leather jacket
@entity5 calls its range ' on trend , as much about quality and affordability '
first it *launched* £ 4 perfume now the supermarket is selling cut price clothes
shoppers can buy useful staples like a chiffon blouse for only £ 5.99
