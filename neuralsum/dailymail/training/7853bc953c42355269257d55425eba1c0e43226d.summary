a mother - of - three has taken the drastic step of cancelling @entity2 for her young sons after becoming exasperated by their disrespectful behavior and unchecked sense of entitlement			0
@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , is using this coming holiday season to teach her boys - @entity11 , 11 , @entity12 , 8 , and @entity13 , 5 – that it is better to give than receive			1
the stay - at - home - mom , 36 , recently wrote about the plan on her over the @entity18 blog and says it was really her husband , 34 - year - old @entity20 , who came up with the idea			1
on her blog she explained that while the family were n't cancelling ‘ putting up decorations , celebrating the birth of our @entity36 , or any of our other heart - warming traditions ’ , but they would be going without ‘ presents , @entity24 , and stockings			1
’ @entity7 and @entity20 felt their kids had lost sight of the fact that gifts are n’t an automatic entitlement and should be earned through good behavior			1
‘ our kids have been acting so ungrateful lately			2
they expect so much even when their behavior is extremely disrespectful , ’ she wrote			0
‘ we gave them good warning , either it was time for their behavior to change or there would be consequences			0
' we patiently worked with them for several months and guess what , very little changed			0
’ on her blog @entity7 explained that while the family were n't cancelling ‘ putting up decorations , celebrating the birth of our @entity36 , or any of our other heart - warming traditions ’ , but they would be going without ‘ presents , @entity24 , and stockings ’ with @entity2 now canceled , the money the parents would have spent on their three sons will instead be put towards gifts for others			1
‘ we are trying to teach them the pleasure of giving rather than continuing to feed their childhood desire for more , ’ she wrote			1
although the boys were initially very upset by the decision , @entity7 says she is proud at how they have quickly learned to embrace the joy of giving - which was the original purpose of the exercise			1
’ they have reacted by making gifts for each other and sneaking them into each others stockings , ' she wrote in an update to her original november 24 entitled ‘ why my husband and i cancelled @entity2 ’			2
' they are learning exactly what we wanted them to learn , because they are not moping around feeling sorry for themselves			0
they are thinking of others			0
' the kids will also still receive parents from their grandparents and other family members			0
@entity7 and @entity93 have taken the drastic step of canceling @entity2 for her young sons after becoming exasperated by their disrespectful behavior and unchecked sense of entitlement ' these will be more cherished because the quantity will be @entity101 can enjoy what they get rather than feel overstimulated with so much , ' wrote their mom			2
some of the good deeds the family are doing instead include sending used clothing and @entity109 candy to a village in the @entity111 that was hit by @entity112 last year			0
the @entity93 's are also looking into an adopt a @entity114 program and will be joined for @entity2 dinner by several older widows and couples near them who would otherwise be on their own			0
