the man who invented the coffee pods used by millions of @entity2 in their @entity4 instant brewing machines has admitted he regrets ever coming up with the design			1
in an interview with the @entity7 , @entity8 , who came up with the idea for the coffee pods and the machine in the early 1990s , revealed that he ' feels bad ' about the negative impact that the pods are having on the environment			1
@entity8 , who no longer uses the plastic pods himself , also confessed he wishes he had never created them in the first place			2
' i feel bad sometimes that i ever did it , ' said mr @entity8 , who sold his share of the company in 1997 for $ 50,000			2
last year the company sold 9.8 billion @entity4 - brewed portion packs and earned $ 4.7billion			0
the design is simple - a small plastic capsule containing ground beans that can be put into a machine to produce a cup of coffee at the touch of a button			0
however despite the multi-billion pound success of the company nothing has been done to try and make the packaging of the popular @entity4 pods recyclable			2
and mr @entity8 insists this will never happen			2
' no matter what they say about recycling , those things will never be recyclable , ' he said			0
' the plastic is a specialized plastic made of four different layers			0
' mr @entity8 , who co-founded the company with @entity49 , added that the unique plastic used in the @entity4 - known as plastic # 7 - is only recyclable in a small number of cities in @entity54 , and can not as yet be processed yet in the @entity2			1
unfortunately the plastic is also integral to the unique design of the pods			0
it ensures that the coffee inside stays completely protected from any outside elements and remains completely intact while the coffee is being brewed			0
the popularity of the simplistic coffee pods has also come across the shores to the @entity65			2
adverts for @entity4 featuring the slogan ' brew the @entity68 ' , enticed @entity2 audiences			1
and in @entity70 thousands of customers have been lured into buying @entity73 machines following similar adverts featuring @entity75			1
@entity73 is now the most prominent capsule company in the @entity65			2
the machines do not take the @entity4 capsules but take similar plastic ones and @entity73 has established its own sustainability advisory board			0
mr @entity8 also confessed that despite his earlier dedication to the brand , he no longer drinks coffee made using the capsules			1
in 1995 he had to go to hospital with heart palpitations after testing up to 40 cups of his coffee a day			1
he now no longer even owns a @entity4 machine and only drinks filter coffee			1
@entity75 has helped popularise the @entity73 brand in the @entity65 , a similar version of the @entity4 damaging : @entity4 has come under fire on numerous occasions from environmentalists who claim that the number of @entity4 sold in 2014 alone would circle the earth 12 times if they were laid down end - to - end @entity4 has come under fire on numerous occasions from environmentalists who claim that the number of @entity4 sold in 2014 alone , and subsequently put into landfills , would circle the earth a staggering 12 times if they were laid down end - to - end			1
they have started a kill the @entity4 campaign , which features a @entity107 video showing the world being destroyed by the plastic coffee capsules			0
but despite the continued criticism , @entity110 , the brewing system 's parent company , has yet to come up with a viable solution to the problem , despite insisting that they have been trying to find an environmentally - friendly alternative since 2006			1
' it 's a warranted criticism , ' @entity117 , chief sustainability officer for @entity110 , told the @entity119 earlier this year			0
' we 're not proud of where we are right now , and we 're committed to fixing it			0
' alternative option : mr @entity8 insists that he has managed to create a new design for the @entity4 which would be far more environmentally - friendly than the ones currently being used not according to mr @entity8			1
the entrepreneur insists that he has come up with an alternative design to his original creation which would involve relying on the same kinds of materials used for foil ketchup packets			0
but while mr @entity8 is convinced that he holds the answer to @entity4 's ongoing environmental concerns , he added that the company have thus far refused to trial his new design			1
' i told them how to improve it , but they do n't want to listen , ' he added to the @entity7			0
' there 's a much better way of doing it			0
' ironically , mr @entity8 's current work , running energy efficient solar energy company @entity146 , requires him to be much more mindful of the environment , which is perhaps why he is suffering from such feelings of guilt over his most infamous creation .			2

@entity8 created the @entity4 instant coffee system in the early 1990s
one in three homes in @entity2 is thought to have coffee brewing system
mr @entity8 said @entity4 's own - brand @entity4 pods can not be recycled
he admitted he no longer drinks @entity4 coffee or owns a @entity4 machine
@entity8 drinks filter coffee after @entity4 testing caused heart palpitations
@entity2 were *charmed* by ' brew the @entity68 ' adverts to buy a @entity4
similar adverts in @entity65 for @entity73 were *fronted* by @entity75
this has *boosted* popularity of @entity73 capsule coffee in the @entity65
