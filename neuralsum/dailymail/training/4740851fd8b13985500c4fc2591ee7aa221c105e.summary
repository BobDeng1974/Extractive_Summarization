@entity0 & @entity1 is not anything like @entity3 – a statement that may come as a shock to some , but is – in fact , wholly justified			2
for developers @entity8 have not simply repackaged @entity11 ’s winning formula , but have carved their own niche			2
the result is a wonderful , often moving , tribute to the golden age of gaming – a high speed trip down memory lane exploring the titles which shaped video game history			1
vibrant : graphics stay true to each one of @entity24 's masterpieces , while giving them a current - gen twist			1
thankfully , every bit of @entity24 ’s work has been handled with respect and care			1
you ’ll race across the aircraft carrier decks made famous in @entity32 , meander through the orange canyons of @entity34 , and weave through rivers of lava in @entity37			2
the visuals , too , are exceptional – striking a perfect balance between achieving nostalgia without taking away from each one ’s distinct artistic direction			2
colours are vibrant , draw distances impressive and every mascot has been lovingly restored in pixel - perfect glory			1
refreshingly , gameplay has had as much love and care spent on it , too			1
for starters , it does n’t simply involve driving around in a cart			0
instead , your vehicle can transform into a boat or plane to adapt to the ever - changing levels			1
laps are rarely the same , and see you gliding through the skies one minute , and tackling waves the next			0
all vehicles handle very differently			0
in cart mode , you can drift around corners to accumulate boost , while you ’re encouraged to zip through checkpoints when in plane form			0
boats bob up and down gleefully , handling in a way reminiscent of @entity69			0
it ’s this variation in gameplay that makes the career mode so enjoyable – all too often the weakest hand in these sort of games			1
there ’s even an xp system , which allows you to upgrade your character and their vehicle			0
other modes include @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			0
multiplayer , though , is where most of the fun is – both offline or when taking on up to 10 players online			2
old favourites : there 's a large roster of @entity24 stars to choose from , each with their own powers and cart			1
although graphics and frame rate take a hit when competing in split - screen mode , there are wonderfully inventive party modes ( that are best left a surprise ) , as well as more traditional racing			1
that ’s what best describes @entity1 … ’ a surprise ’			0
a game that stands head and shoulders above every carting game of recent years , and one – like the titles it pays tribute to – will be remembered and cherished			0
( @entity114 out november 30 ) follow @entity115 on @entity116 : @ @entity117 and on @entity118 : @entity119 .			0

*stunning* trip down memory lane *revisiting* @entity24 *classics*
well balanced gameplay - transformations work well
levels *constantly* change , so gameplay never gets *boring*
multiplayer graphics noticeably worse , with some framerate issues
