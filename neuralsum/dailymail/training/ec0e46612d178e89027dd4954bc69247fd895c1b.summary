little @entity7 was just two weeks old when his mother toppled on top of him , shattering his pelvis and breaking and dislocating his femur			0
a kindly soul took the injured animal to @entity13 , a non-profit @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 where , despite his injuries , @entity7 has gone from strength to strength thanks to the care he has received			0
but working with tiny bones and fragile piglets is never easy and @entity7 proved way too small for the tiniest of carts that would have otherwise taken the pressure off his compromised limbs			2
however , staff at the sanctuary refused to give up and built a special cart to take the strain off @entity7 's limbs as they mend			0
