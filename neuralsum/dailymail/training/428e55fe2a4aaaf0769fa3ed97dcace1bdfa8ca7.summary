by @entity0 published : 08:38 est , 6 october 2013 updated : 09:58 est , 6 october 2013 she may have no qualms about opting for the skimpiest of outfits to show off her enviable figure on @entity6 , but @entity7 says she 's ' horrendously unfit '			1
' i do n’t train or go to the gym , ' says the super svelte model , 27 , who stars in the 11th series of the dancing show			1
' i ’m strong but i ’ve got no stamina			2
i get out of breath so easily			2
that ’s one of the things i ’m looking forward to the most about @entity6			1
i ’m most looking forward to just getting my fitness up , toning up and feeling good			0
but the size 6 lingerie and catwalk model claims that one of the pivotal reasons she signed up to the @entity41 show was to get in shape , in an interview with the @entity44			1
@entity21 also dismisses any suggestion that , as a model , she does n't eat properly			1
and she says she 's been tucking into extra portions to keep her energy up for strenuous routines and rehearsals			0
' i ’ve been trying to eat a lot more over the past few weeks			2
i mean i eat a lot anyway , ' she says			2
' there ’s some myth that i starve myself , but i really do n’t			2
i eat what i want and i ’ve got a very healthy appetite			0
' ' but with all the training you do for @entity6 , you ’re naturally more hungry			1
everyone is constantly eating on the show because you just burn so much energy dancing and practicing your routines			0
you need to eat well otherwise you ca n’t function and you get too tired and feel a bit sick			0
' the thigh 's the limit ! @entity7 ditched the elegant ball dress she wore on last week 's @entity6 in favour of an eye wateringly skimpy pink minidress as she took to the stage on saturday night 's the @entity75 wife of @entity76 performed with her professional partner for the first time last weekend for this year ’s @entity6 along with 14 other celebrities			1
she looked the picture of elegance and grace as she took to the dancefloor			0
but on saturday night she well and truly sent pulses racing as she ramped up the sex factor on the show			0
casting aside the ladylike ensemble she wore for her ballroom routine , @entity21 strutted her stuff in an eye wateringly skimpy minidress as she tried her hand at @entity93			1
making sure to show off her tiny model figure in a striking pink number , she opted for the most daring outfit of the night in a thigh - skimming frock with cut - out detail as she took to the dancefloor alongside partner @entity29 to perform a sassy cha cha			1
and it would seem the @entity75 beauty found a particular fan in the form of judge @entity30 , who told her : ' do n't worry , there is plenty to fancy about @entity108			0
' the attitude , the sex kitten , the nonchalant @entity111			0
you look fab ! you did a tiny little stumble at the end but i tell you , so good			0
' @entity31 added : ' i thought it was loud and proud , full of attitude and rhythm			0
you 're a good dancer , @entity21 , you are			1
' @entity21 seemed annoyed with herself over little mistakes , but scored a total of 30 points ranking her in fourth place			1
