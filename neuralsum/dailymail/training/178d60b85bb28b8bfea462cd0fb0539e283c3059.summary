a first grader in @entity1 was suspended after his teachers said that he threatened to shoot another student by making a hand gesture of a gun			1
adding to that , teachers also were scared because @entity8 allegedly said ' pow ' while doing the motion			2
this is not the first time since the elementary school shooting in @entity14 , @entity15 where a student has been suspended for making a preconceived threat of violence , but it may be the youngest : @entity8 is only 6 - years - old			1
demonstrating : @entity8 , 6 , made the gun hand symbol three times in one day at school ' his record says suspended for ' threatening to shoot a student ' and that 's a lie , ' his family 's lawyer @entity23 told @entity27			1
in their view , his actions were those of a young boy who thought he was just joking around with friends , but school officials took a different side			2
the timing of the incident did not help his case , as the child made the gesture one week after the @entity40 in @entity15 where 20 students and six teaching staff died			1
@entity45 school 's assistant principal @entity43 wrote to the boy 's parents and told them that it was not the first time the boy had threatened another student			1
suspended : @entity8 was kicked out of school for one day before @entity53 break and now will have the move on his permanent record concerned : the boy 's parents want the suspension scrubbed off his record @entity43 wrote that the 6 - year - old had been sent to the assistant principal 's office twice on december 20th and told not to make that hand gesture			1
' yet , after meeting with the counselor and assistant principal , @entity8 chose to point his finger at a female classmate and say " pow , " ' the letter reads			2
@entity8 maintains that he was not the one to say ' pow ' - arguing that his friend who was making a similar hand gesture was the one to add sound effects			0
' and i 'm the one that gets suspended for just nothing , ' he said to @entity27 , rolling his eyes			1
during the third visit to the principal 's office , the boy was questioned about whether or not his parents owned guns , and what if any video games he played at home			0
suspension : the elementary school in @entity86 was holding a conference about the december incident as students returned from holiday today @entity23 , the boy 's attorney , told the @entity92 : ' what they 're doing is looking at the worst possible interpretation of a young , naive six - year - old			1
' this is a little child who ca n't form the intent to do anything like that			0
' the lawyer said the child 's parents were not aware of previous behavioral issues and were concerned that the incident would remain on his record indefinitely			2
the ruling can be appealed within ten days			0
there have been heightened tensions at schools across the @entity111 since the shooting in @entity14 , @entity15 on december 14			1
support : @entity115 students returned to school at another building in the neighboring town of @entity119 today			0
there have been heightened tensions at schools across the @entity111 following the december 14 massacre @entity115 students attended a neighboring school in the town of @entity119 today for an open house ahead of classes beginning tomorrow			2
teachers and grief counselors are on hand to help students come to terms with their new surroundings which have been remodeled to look like their old school as much as possible			0
superintendent @entity134 said they will try to make everything as normal as possible for the children			0
' we want to get back to teaching and learning , ' she said			0
' we will obviously take time out from the academics for any conversations that need to take place , and there will be a lot of support there			0
' all in all , we want the kids to reconnect with their friends and classroom teachers , and i think that 's going to be the healthiest thing			0
