an experienced angler got the shock of his life when he was out on a fishing trip and reeled in what he thought was a large barramundi and instead pulled in a 4.5 metre saltwater crocodile			1
@entity9 was on a barramundi charter on the @entity11 in the @entity12 when the group he was with decided to stop for lunch and throw out a few fishing lines on the bank while they rested			1
after reeling in a few catfish , @entity9 threw out his line and felt it catch			1
' i turned to one of the other guys and said , ' i think that 's a croc ! he said , ' nah , it could n't be			0
' ' the next minute a four and a half meter crocodile came to the surface ! it was insane			0
' @entity9 said he had never heard or seen a thing like it , and neither had any of the others on the trip			1
' it 's behaviour was really weird , ' @entity9 said			1
' it was really timid , considering it had a hook in it 's mouth			0
it hissed a bit but it did n't go anywhere near us , ' the fisherman said he nor anyone on the charter with him that day had ever seen anything like it ' i thought it would have thrashed , but it almost seemed sedated			1
eventually we got the tension off the line because we did n't want to hurt it			0
' @entity9 said that the boat came up close to the crocodile so that @entity9 could release the massive saltwater creature			1
' i went with @entity64 , and they were such good guys			0
the host @entity66 was amazing about it all , and even he had said he 'd never seen anything like it			0
' ' it was certainly something i 've never seen before and probably never will again			0
i 've seen a few small sharks but never a four and a half meter saltwater crocodile			1
' @entity9 was surprised by how calm the giant reptile was while he was releasing him another family on the charter boat from @entity76 were fascinated by the crocodile ( not pictured ) ' there was a family from @entity76 with us , and they were buzzing			1
' @entity9 said that he was astounded by the size of the animal , and was excited to go home and tell his family what he 'd seen			2
' i went home and told my son , ' @entity87 went fishing today			0
guess what he caught ? , ' @entity9 said			2
' he guessed a shark , and then i said , no , a crocodile			0
' @entity9 said he posted it online because he was so amazed and wanted other people to be able to see it			2
' how many people get to say they 've caught a saltwater crocodile ? although i did n't really catch it , we did let it go after all			2
' @entity9 said he was astounded by the size of the animal , and was excited to go home and tell his family			0
