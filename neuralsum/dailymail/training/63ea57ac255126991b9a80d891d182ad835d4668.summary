the number of people being poisoned by e-cigarettes has soared in the last few years , according to an official report			2
the number of calls to poison centres in the @entity7 relating to the liquids in e-cigarettes has risen from one per month in september 2010 , to 215 per month in february 2014			1
the figures , from the @entity11 , also show that the number of calls per month relating to conventional cigarettes did not increase in the same way			0
however , some 42 per cent are related to adults over the age of 20			1
as e-cigarettes become more popular , they are linked to more poisoning cases			1
the analysis compared total monthly poison centre calls involving e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes , and found the proportion of e-cigarette calls jumped from 0.3 per cent in september 2010 to 41.7 per cent in february 2014			1
poisoning from conventional cigarettes is generally due to young children eating them			2
poisoning related to e-cigarettes involves the liquid containing nicotine used in the devices			1
it can occur in three ways - by ingestion , inhalation or absorption through the skin or eyes			0
‘ this report raises another red flag about e-cigarettes – the liquid nicotine used in e-cigarettes can be hazardous , ’ said @entity11 director @entity47			0
e-cigarettes are now responsible for 42 per cent of all poisoning cases related to cigarettes ‘ use of these products is skyrocketing and these poisonings will continue			1
‘ e-cigarette liquids as currently sold are a threat to small children because they are not required to be childproof , and they come in candy and fruit flavours that are appealing to children			1
’ e-cigarette calls were more likely than cigarette calls to include a report of an adverse health effect following exposure			2
the most common adverse health effects mentioned in e-cigarette calls were vomiting , nausea and eye irritation			0
the data for the study came from the poison centres that serve the 50 states , the @entity78 , and @entity79			0
poison centres reported 2,405 e-cigarette and 16,248 cigarette exposure calls from september 2010 to february 2014			1
the total number of poisoning cases is likely higher than reflected in this study , because not all exposures might have been reported to poison centres			1
‘ the most recent @entity90 showed e-cigarette use is growing fast , and now this report shows e-cigarette related poisonings are also increasing rapidly , ’ said @entity88 , director of @entity11 ’s @entity89			1
‘ health care providers , e-cigarette companies and distributors , and the general public need to be aware of this potential health risk from e-cigarettes			2
’ the news comes just days after it was announced that the @entity102 government will consider including e-cigarettes under the smoking ban			1
ministers say they might ban smoking the electronic devices inside because they could glamourize smoking and act as a gateway to normal cigarettes			2
currently , there are no plans to ban them in @entity112 , but the chief medical officer has raised concerns about their safety			0
earlier this week it was announced that the @entity102 government is considering extending the smoking ban to include e-cigarettes			1
this would mean people were not allowed to smoke the electronic devices inside			0
ministers say they have made the proposal because they fear e-cigarettes could glamourize smoking and act as a gateway to normal cigarettes			2
@entity127 , health minister in the @entity129 - run @entity102 government , said people have spent 30 years creating a climate in which people understand smoking is not glamorous but he is concerned e-cigarettes could undo that good work			1
there are currently no plans to ban them in @entity112 but the chief medical officer has raised concerns about their safety			0
dame @entity137 said : ' we are normalising e-cigarettes			0
if they were regulated as a medicine and we knew what was in them and the dose of nicotine , then they might play a useful role in stopping smoking			0
but they are n't , so at the moment we do n't know their safety or the dose they deliver			0
' @entity154 are often attractive to children – cookies and cream and bubblegum			0
' they are sold rather cheaply and many are made in @entity161 , so i worry about what 's in them			0
' i am also worried about once again making smoking seem like a normal activity			0

more than half of poisoning cases were in children under five
in 2010 e-cigarettes responsible for 0.3 **%** of cigarette - related poisonings
by early 2014 , the figure had risen to 42 **%** of cigarette - related poisonings
e-cigarette liquids are not required to be childproof , and they come in candy and fruit flavours that are appealing to children , *experts* warn
@entity102 is currently considering banning smoking e-cigarettes inside
