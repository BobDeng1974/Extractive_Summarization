top of her science class : @entity2 , in her uniform for @entity4 in @entity5 these pictures show a teenage girl enjoying life in modern @entity9 before joining @entity10 to become a ‘ jihadi bride ’			1
she laughs in the park , shows off vividly painted nails , and poses with the athletics ’ squad of her @entity5 school , where she was top of her science class			1
on @entity17 , she writes of going swimming with a friend , loving the music of @entity21 rapper @entity20 and enjoying a birthday treat			2
few could have predicted what 15 - year - old @entity2 would do next			1
two weeks ago , in the middle of half - term , she abruptly walked out of her family ’s council home in @entity5 , wearing black jeans and trainers			1
she caught a bus to @entity31 and flew to @entity32 with two fellow @entity34 classmates , @entity35 , 16 , and @entity36 , 15			1
next — in footage captured by cctv cameras — the trio waited in the snow to board another bus to travel to the @entity43 border with @entity44			1
there , @entity46 militants were waiting for them			2
the girls , by now dressed in burkas , were bundled into cars and disappeared to a life where they will have to marry a fighter selected for them , never step foot outside without him , and become a household drone doing chores restricted to women			2
intelligence services say they may even be trained to become fighters themselves			2
@entity2 is not the first @entity63 girl to join @entity46			1
police said this week that 60 young @entity9 women , many of them schoolgirls , have left for @entity44			1
few , however , have been radicalised so swiftly as @entity2			1
back in @entity5 , her friends — many of them non-muslims — have given a series of exclusive interviews to explain how she had changed before their eyes			1
as one 16 - year - old girl told me this week : ‘ she was perfectly normal			2
she talked about having a lip - piercing one day , and listened to pop chart songs			0
‘ she was pretty , popular , and a bit of a rebel who saw the funny side of life			0
i first met her in maths class four years ago			0
’ painted nails : fifteen - year - old @entity2 , who was born in @entity81 , larks around with her friends in the park born in @entity81 , @entity2 moved with her family first to @entity86 , and then @entity87 , before returning here and starting school at @entity4 at the age of 11			1
‘ when i visited , i found her home was not overpoweringly @entity94 , ’ her friend added			0
‘ we had a family meal cooked by her mother , who did not wear the hijab at home			0
after eating , @entity2 and i went out to the park			1
‘ she had a @entity102 phone at 11 or 12 , and later an @entity103 and computer			0
she was on them all the time			0
’ at school , @entity2 , a @entity106 football fan , shone in debates , once giving a speech on why @entity34 women wear the veil			1
she passed three gcses in maths and science early , at age 14			0
this autumn , she ’d planned to study a-level history , maths and biology at the @entity118 , set up for high - fliers under the free school programme			0
her talents did not stop in class			0
at 13 and 14 she was a star of the school athletics squad , competing across @entity124 in the 800 and 1,200 metres			0
off to join @entity10 : @entity2 ( centre , circled ) caught a bus to @entity31 and flew to @entity32 with two fellow @entity34 classmates , @entity35 ( left ) , 16 , and @entity36 ( right ) , 15			1
they are pictured at @entity31 although she wore the hijab to class , covering her hair in line with @entity94 teachings , she abandoned the headgear when she played sport or was with her girl friends			2
a member of the athletics squad explained : ‘ @entity2 did n’t make a big thing about her @entity34 faith			1
she came to parties if there was no alcohol , and we ’d go shopping for clothes			0
she was one of us			0
‘ she got friendly with a boy she met at athletics			0
we teased her about standing very close to him , so she joked she was leaning on him for support			0
her parents would not have approved of a boyfriend			0
’ yet last year @entity2 was exposed to a parallel world from her non-muslim friends			1
while they were going clubbing , meeting boyfriends , and taking foreign holidays together , these @entity63 ways were forbidden to @entity2 because of her background			1
she was expected to pray regularly , and was , her friends think , facing an arranged marriage to a man of her family ’s choice in the future			2
another friend said : ‘ we suspect she joined @entity10 because it was exciting thing to do ; a way of rebelling			2
unlike us , there were not a lot of exciting options open to her			0
’ model student : @entity2 was due to study three a-levels at the @entity118 this autumn by the time of her 15th birthday in may last year , @entity2 had become a ‘ different person ’			1
she cut herself off from her ‘ clique ’ of @entity179 friends , and mixed instead with two other @entity34 girls in the same school year group : @entity35 and @entity36 , who , of course , are now with her in @entity44			1
her old school friends said they were shocked when she sent them a video link claiming that @entity185 were deliberately burning @entity187 children			2
‘ it was horrifying because it showed babies being hurt			0
i deleted it , ’ admitted one			0
@entity2 and her two @entity34 friends were overheard using derogatory terms for @entity179 girls , calling one a ‘ slag ’ and others ‘ kafir ’ ( an @entity200 term for non-believer )			1
‘ she was getting into religion and @entity206 affairs seriously			0
she hung around with these two @entity34 girls all the time , ’ said her friend			0
we now know that one of those girls , @entity36 , used her @entity212 account to contact a former medical student , 20 - year - old @entity213 , who left @entity214 last year to join @entity10 and marry a jihadist			1
@entity217 bus station : in footage captured by cctv cameras , the trio ( above ) waited to board a bus to travel to the @entity43 border with @entity44			1
there , @entity46 militants were waiting for them @entity36 was following 70 other @entity10 terrorists on @entity212 , too , many of whom , like @entity227 , used a messaging programme called @entity231			2
this encrypts messages to avoid interception by intelligence authorities			0
when messages are deleted by @entity10 recruiters , they are automatically erased from the phones of those who have received them			0
friends suspect that @entity2 and the other girls were in touch with @entity245 and other @entity10 recruiters via their mobile phones or home computers since before @entity249			1
‘ @entity2 is portrayed by police and the school as naïve and vulnerable , ’ said one of her friends			1
‘ but she was savvy and intelligent , and used to getting what she wanted			0
’ police were called to @entity4 in december after a friend of @entity2 ’s , a @entity34 girl of 15 who has not been named , disappeared to @entity44			1
they talked to @entity2 and her two new friends , but concluded they were not being groomed by @entity10 online recruiters			1
yet one of @entity2 ’s friends insists : ‘ by the time the police came , @entity2 had isolated herself from @entity179 pupils			1
i am surprised the police did not discover she was already fascinated with the @entity46 and people like @entity269			0
’ runner : at 13 and 14 @entity2 was a star of the school athletics squad , competing across @entity124 in the 800 and 1,200 metres @entity2 left her family home in the morning of tuesday , february 17 , telling her father she was going to a wedding			1
she was carrying no luggage , although @entity277 shows her and the other girls at @entity31 before boarding a flight with heavy holdalls			0
who gave them the bags ? was it an on - the - ground @entity10 recruiter in @entity5 ? the question has not yet been answered			2
the bags contained the @entity94 robes and coats with hoods that the girls were wearing by the time they reached @entity32			0
by late morning on the tuesday , @entity2 had texted her father , 47 - year - old @entity293 , who thought his daughter was at the wedding			2
she said it was ‘ a little bit far ’ , and added : ‘ daddy , i will pray my midday prayer and get back home			0
’ at midnight , the family reported @entity2 missing and were desperately messaging her school friends to see if she was with them			1
one of her old friends admits now : ‘ i was getting worried about her			2
she told girls in school that she agreed with what the @entity46 was doing in @entity44			2
‘ i feel that i have lost my friend for ever			0
’ she is probably right .			0

@entity2 is one of three pupils from @entity5 who went to @entity44
