two in three gout sufferers are not receiving treatment to cure their condition , say researchers			1
they found that @entity4 are issuing prescriptions to just a third of the patients who could benefit			1
but the research shows nearly half of gout sufferers qualify for treatment at their first consultation			1
gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis that causes acute pain , redness and swelling in peripheral joints , most commonly in the big toe			1
the condition is caused by deposits of monosodium urate crystals , which are related to high levels of uric acid in the blood , and can be alleviated using urate - lowering treatment ( @entity43 )			2
the condition , which affects the joints , mainly the big toe , famously afflicted @entity23 , pictured researchers at @entity48 investigated when patients on a large @entity21 primary care database became eligible for @entity43 , and how many of them ended up being prescribed it			1
of 52,164 patients with gout , the average time to the first treatment for complications such as multiple attacks and chronic kidney disease was five months			1
at the first consultation the likelihood of them being eligible for @entity43 was 44 per cent , with a 61 per cent likelihood after one year			0
after five years , the chances of gout patients being eligible for treatment rose to 87 per cent , then to 94 per cent at ten years following diagnosis			2
however , the average prescription rate for @entity43 among the practices studied was 32.5 per cent , says a report in the @entity70			0
research leader dr @entity71 said : ‘ our study aimed to estimate the proportion of patients fulfilling eligibility criteria for urate - lowering treatment since the diagnosis of the disease			2
‘ the majority of patients are eligible at or shortly following diagnosis			0
' however , only one third of eligible patients received such potentially curative treatment			0
' this suboptimal treatment occurs for many reasons , including insufficient knowledge of the disease and its management , and misconceptions concerning its causes and its impact on patients ’ quality of life and wellbeing			0
‘ our recommendation is to give full information to patients early in their clinical course at the time that they are first being informed about gout , its causes and the treatments that are available			0
