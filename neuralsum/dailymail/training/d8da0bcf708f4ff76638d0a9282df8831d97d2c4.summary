by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 10:07 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 05:54 est , 21 september 2012 the @entity3 admitted today it was ' self - evident ' that the attack on the @entity6 consulate in @entity7 was a terrorist act - but the president himself refused to use this phrase or confirm @entity13 involvement			1
@entity6 ambassador @entity14 and three others were killed in the deadly assault on the @entity18 compound on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks			1
president @entity21 said on thursday that extremists used an anti-islam video as an excuse to assault @entity6 interests overseas , including the attack on the consulate			1
speaking at a candidate forum on the @entity30 - language network @entity31 , @entity21 said : ' what we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm @entity6 interests			1
' he added : ' we will focus narrowly and forcefully on groups like @entity13 , the ones that carried out the 9/11 attacks			2
those forces have not gone away			0
' @entity58 have accused the @entity21 administration of misreading the assault as the outgrowth of widespread demonstrations in the @entity63 over the video			0
they insisted it was a terrorist attack , a term @entity3 spokesman @entity67 used on thursday			1
@entity21 did not use the phrase			0
earlier in the week , senior state department officials had refused to call the raid an act of terrorism			2
however nine days after the attacks , @entity67 said : ' it is , i think , self evident that what happened in @entity18 was a terrorist attack			1
' our embassy was attacked violently and the result was four deaths of @entity6 officials			2
' under the spotlight : @entity21 was questioned by @entity31 news anchors @entity87 , left and @entity88 , center , at the @entity90 in @entity91 ' self - evident ' : @entity3 spokesman @entity67 said today the attacks on the @entity6 consulate in @entity7 were acts of terror @entity67 's admission came after director of the @entity6 @entity98 , @entity99 , told the @entity100 on wednesday that the attack was planned and not merely the result of protesters demonstrating against an @entity105 film			1
' i would say yes , they were killed in the course of a terrorist attack on our embassy , ' @entity106 said at a @entity100 @entity114 hearing			1
the new revelations were after @entity46 said today there was ' no information ' that the @entity6 ambassador to @entity7 was on an @entity13 hit list despite his alleged fears of an attack			1
@entity14 had worried about what he called the ' never - ending ' security threats in the @entity7 city and was concerned about the increasing threats of @entity128 extremism and @entity13 , @entity122 reported			1
however the @entity129 said she had ' no reason to believe that there 's any basis for that ' , referring to a report where a source close to @entity14 relayed his concerns			2
the revelations raise yet more questions about why the ambassador and the three other @entity6 citizens killed in the attack were at the consulate with scant security			1
@entity145 faced questions from members of the @entity3 and @entity100 about the september 11 attack on the consulate in @entity18 in a series of closed - door classified briefings on @entity153			1
concerns : @entity14 , pictured speaking to @entity157 member for @entity159 dr. @entity158 , said he was on an @entity13 hit list before he was killed in an attack on the @entity18 consulate leader : @entity164 , who has known extremist ties , became one of the top commanders of rebel forces in @entity18 @entity145 also announced that , in line with federal law , she will appoint an independent panel to look at circumstances of the attack in @entity18 that killed ambassador @entity14 and three other employees			1
the so - called @entity177 will be chaired by retired diplomat @entity178 , she said			0
democrats and @entity58 emerging from the briefings provided some details about what the administration is still piecing together - who was responsible , how much of it was planned and what was the security			2
joining @entity145 at the briefings were director of national intelligence @entity187 and deputy defense secretary @entity189			0
rep. @entity190 of @entity191 , the top @entity192 on the @entity193 , said it was ' clearly a terrorist attack , ' but mortars were n't used until six , seven hours into the fight			1
@entity190 added : ' so it seemed like an armed gang that seized an opportunity			0
' both @entity190 and rep. @entity201 of @entity202 , the top @entity192 on the @entity203 , said there was no evidence to suggest that the local @entity7 at the consulate colluded with the attackers			2
some reports have suggested that @entity164 , a former detainee at the @entity6 military prison at @entity210 , @entity211 , who was transferred to @entity7 in 2007 , was involved			1
lawmakers asked about @entity164 at the briefing			0
' but not directly related to the attack , but as someone who 's in that region , ' @entity190 said			0
' they 're attempting to establish whether or not he was connected to the people who made the attack			0
he 's certainly a person of interest			0
' investigators have found no evidence or intelligence to suggest @entity164 was at the conflict , leading it or organizing it , according to a @entity6 official			2
attack : the @entity6 embassy in @entity18 was raided on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks deadly : four people died , including @entity6 ambassador @entity14 , during an assault on the @entity6 @entity237 in @entity18 , @entity7 the former @entity13 terrorist released from @entity210 had been named as the apparent leader of the attack on the @entity6 consulate			1
@entity164 , who was reportedly once @entity242 's driver , was let out of the @entity6 military detention center in @entity211 in 2007 and turned over to the government of @entity245 on the condition he be kept behind bars			2
the @entity6 military characterized him as a ' medium to high ' risk to national security while he was in @entity6 custody and he refused to cooperate with authorities and explain his past associations with @entity128 extremists			1
@entity164 , 53 , is a @entity7 army veteran who was jailed by @entity245 and later escaped and moved to @entity256 , where he worked for one of @entity242 's holding companies			2
according to some reports , he was @entity242 's driver during his time at the company			0
however , he denies this			0
he also fought against the @entity264 in @entity265 with the @entity266			0
later he took up arms against the @entity268 and fought alongside the @entity269			0
later , he moved to @entity270 and slipped across the border into @entity265 , where he began working at a charity that was a front for @entity13 in the summer of 2001			2
he was arrested in @entity270 by local authorities shortly after the @entity6 invasion of @entity265			2
he was taken to the @entity210 detention center and held there for six years			2
tragic : @entity14 is the first @entity6 ambassador to be killed by violence overseas since 1979			1
he apparently died of smoke inhalation after the attack on the consulate in @entity18 victims : @entity282 ( left ) , 34 , was a foreign service computer expert who had previously been posted to @entity284			1
@entity285 , 42 , was a former @entity286 who was working as a private security contractor despite his lengthy association with extremists , including the 9/11 mastermind and @entity13 leader himself , the military recommended in a 2005 report sending him back to his home country of @entity7			1
in 2007 , @entity164 was released from @entity297 and turned over to @entity245 on the condition that he be kept in prison			0
but , in 2010 @entity245 freed him from the notorious @entity299 in @entity300 , along with 37 other prisoners , to celebrate the dictator 's 41st year in power			0
during the uprising , @entity164 emerged as a leader of the rebels			0
he was a tank driver during his time in the @entity7 army , though he had been arrested several times on drug and alcohol offenses			0
in addition to mr @entity14 , who friends said devoted his life to promoting peace and cultural understanding , three other @entity6 were killed when a mob attacked and burned the consulate in former rebel stronghold city			1
wrecked : the consulate was badly damaged in the attack that forced @entity6 personnel to flee extremists : the @entity7 government blamed the attack on @entity128 extremists angry over the release of a trailer for an @entity6 anti-islam movie @entity282 , a foreign service officer , was a 34 - year - old father of two			1
@entity285 , 42 , was a former @entity286 who was working at the consulate as a private security contractor			0
the attack on the consulate came after the release of a trailer for the controversial movie ' @entity337 , ' which paints a portrait of @entity128 that many in the @entity128 world find deeply offensive			0
@entity100 @entity58 expressed frustration with the information provided at the sessions and disputed the administration 's assessment			0
' there 's increasing amount of evidence that this was a coordinated attack by terrorists , ' said senator @entity350 , a member of the @entity351			0
' the movie was n't the catalyst for this , the catalyst was radical @entity128 extremists that wanted to attack the @entity6 and saw an opportunity to do it in @entity18			1
' one of the harshest critics of the administration , senator @entity360 , scoffed at the administration 's argument that the video set off the assault			0
' i 'm stunned that they thought this was some kind of spontaneous demonstration , ' @entity360 told reporters			0
destruction : the @entity3 has now named the attack an act of terrorism protests : unrest remains high in @entity7 after the release of ' the @entity337 ' video : last video of @entity14 being dragged from the embassy video : gunmen attack @entity6 consulate in @entity18 september 11th			1
