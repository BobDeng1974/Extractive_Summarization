@entity1 is nursing a hamstring problem which needs rest and not in the top condition , according to the manager			1
when asked about his squad 's fitness ahead of the trip to the @entity13 on sunday , @entity0 said : ' everybody ’s ready			1
@entity1 ( @entity1 ) is not in the best condition but he will start			1
he plays sunday and not against @entity4 , then he plays against @entity31			2
' that ’s his evolution			0
let ’s hope he goes in the right direction and becomes available for every game			2
' last season he was at @entity37 , this season the problem was in the national team but i do n’t want to speak about it			2
the player is fantastic in his amazing attitude to play			2
' i know what we have and clearly that we have to protect him until he gets completely fit			0
' @entity0 talks to his backroom staff as he prepares his side to face @entity3 on sunday @entity20 striker @entity48 jumps in to block a pass during @entity17 training before the trip to the @entity52 @entity1 ( right ) scored a hat - trick against @entity54 and has seven in five matches this season @entity0 ( pictured ) masterminded a @entity17 victory against @entity3 at the @entity13 last season sunday 's match also raises the possibility of @entity59 facing the @entity20 for the first time since leaving this summer			1
and @entity0 insists it is not ' strange ' that @entity59 is now at @entity3 but he would not have foreseen the move just months ago			1
' it ’s football - not strange , ' he said			0
@entity59 could make his first appearance against @entity17 since leaving the club this summer @entity0 says it will not be ' strange ' to face @entity59 but he did not envisage the midfielder going to @entity3 ' i would n’t have imagined that			1
even a few months ago when he signed for the @entity71 ( @entity3 ) team , i was n’t expecting that			1
but it ’s his decision			0
' when he left for @entity71 i thought he was going to @entity71 but it is his life and his decision and he has my respect for that			0
' the magnitude of the match has not escaped @entity0 either , although he was keen to play down the importance of just one fixture			2
the midfielder left @entity17 at the start of the summer and moved to the @entity52 on loan from @entity71 @entity0 says his ' job is easier ' against bigger teams because he does not have to motivate the players he continued : ' it ’s always a good time to play the big teams			1
against the big teams my job is easier			1
' it 's one more game , three more points - but obviously when matches are between title contenders every point makes a difference			2
' @entity99 and @entity3 got one point each ( last week ) which means nobody got three			2
' these matches can be important but in a simple and pragmatic point of view it ’s one game , three points and no more			1
' we do n’t play against just them			0
we play against another 19 teams			0
it ’s not just @entity3 for the title			2
this is not a situation of @entity17 or @entity3			1

' statistics belong to history not to the future			0
can we go there and win ? obviously we can			0
can we lose ? we also can			0
' @entity17 finished third in the @entity137 last season but strengthened their squad with the signings of @entity1 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity111 this summer			1
@entity142 ( left ) is another of @entity17 's players who will be expected to put in a big performance at @entity3 @entity145 ( left ) and @entity146 ( second right ) are part of a settled @entity17 defence but they have let in seven and @entity0 thinks that he has a more competitive group of players to choose from than in the last campaign and that they can challenge the champions			1
' i do n’t want to compare , ' he said			0
' our squad is better than last season			0
' we have players with qualities we did n’t have and feel our squad - although very short only 21 players - we have a good balance and we are happy			0
we do n’t compare ourselves with others			0
' @entity140 , here celebrating scoring against @entity25 , has been excellent for @entity17 so far this season @entity140 has starred so far this season and the @entity165 explained he knew just how good a player he was signing when the @entity168 move from @entity169 this summer			1
he explained : ' i know the qualities ( @entity140 has )			2
age , experience , tactical culture , made in @entity175 - in the @entity137			0
he had no need to learn philosophies and feelings			0
' the team was waiting for a player of his dimension			0
i was expecting him to play the way he ’s been playing			0
' @entity140 celebrates his goal to put @entity17 1 - 0 up on wednesday night and @entity0 says he has ' qualities ' when asked about how he felt after @entity185 was awarded the right to host the 2020 @entity188 final , @entity0 revealed his delight			1
