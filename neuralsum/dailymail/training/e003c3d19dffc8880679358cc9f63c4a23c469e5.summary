by @entity0 whether you like to admit it or not , it 's difficult to resist tapping your foot to a solid bassline such as @entity8 's @entity7 - and now researchers have discovered why			0
psychologists from @entity10 tracked brain activity of volunteers as they listened to piano tones of different pitches			1
the study found that our ears have developed to easily identify changes in lower tones , and this skill develops at a young age			2
to find out why lower tones dominate musical rhythms , researchers at the @entity23 in @entity10 asked 35 volunteers to listen to different pitch piano tones			1
when the lower tone occurred 50 milliseconds too early , the brain recognised it faster than when the higher tone was mistimed ( stock image pictured ) to test their theory , researchers at the @entity23 in @entity10 asked 35 volunteers to listen to two simultaneous streams of computer - synthesized piano tones , each of a different pitch			1
chimpanzees like to listen to music - but have very specific tastes , researchers have found			2
while preferring silence to music from the @entity42 , chimpanzees like to listen to the different rhythms of music from @entity44 and @entity45 , researchers found			2
the research is the first to discover primates have a preference for music , according to the @entity49 , which published the study			0
previous research has found that some nonhuman primates prefer slower tempos , but the current findings may be the first to show that they display a preference for particular rhythmic patterns , according to the study			0
a tenth of the time , the lower tone occurred 50 milliseconds too early ; another tenth of a time , the higher tone occurred 50 milliseconds too early			1
psychologist @entity61 and her colleagues used electroencephalography ( @entity64 ) sensors placed on the scalp to track the brain signals of the volunteers as they listened to these tracks			1
they were looking to see activity that proved when the volunteer had noticed the tones had dropped too soon			0
this detection is typically depicted as a spike of electrical activity , known as a mismatch negativity ( @entity78 )			0
@entity78 is produced by the brain 's auditory cortex from between 120 and 250 milliseconds after an unexpected sound reachee the ear			2
this reaction is typically used to sense when the brain detects something is out of place , for example			0
researchers used @entity64 sensors , ( pictured on @entity23 student @entity91 ) to track brain signals of the volunteers			1
they were looking for spikes of activity when the tones were mistimed , and this typically occurs 120 to 250 milliseconds after the deviant sound reaches the ear the researchers discovered that the @entity78 signals were consistently larger when the lower note was mistimed , compared to the higher notes			1
they also measured the participants â€™ ability to adjust their finger - tapping to the variable timings to discover this was more accurate for the lower notes			0
during a second experiment , the research team used a computer model to study how the ear responds to test sounds			0
they found that the signal from the auditory nerve connected to the cochlea , part of the inner ear involved with hearing , was also better at detecting timings of low - pitched notes			0
the researchers discovered that the signals were consistently larger when the lower note was mistimed , compared to the higher notes ( pictured )			1
they also measured the participants ' ability to adjust their finger - tapping to the variable timings to discover this was more accurate for the lower notes , too this suggests that the differences develop at an early stage of cognitive processing , and humans may have evolved to make these distinctions			1
ms @entity61 claimed that her findings explain why the music of many cultures use rhythms created by low - pitched instruments , while the melody tends to be taken by higher pitched instruments			2
the findings were published in the @entity144 .			0

researchers asked 35 volunteers to listen to tones of different pitches
a tenth of the time , the lower tone occurred 50 milliseconds too early
another tenth of a time , the higher tone occurred 50 milliseconds too early
@entity61 and colleagues used electroencephalography ( @entity64 ) to track the brain signals of the volunteers as they listened to the tones
brain signals were consistently larger when the lower note was mistimed
study claims this ability develops during early cognitive processing
