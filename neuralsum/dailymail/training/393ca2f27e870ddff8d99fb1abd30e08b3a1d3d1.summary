the ' powerful ' drug could drastically reduce the risk of heart attacks and stroke , researchers claim it can be used in people who are taking statins but need an extra ' boost ' or as an alternative to statins in those who can not tolerate them			1
a study found it all but eliminated dangerous blood fats called lipoprotein ( @entity40 ) – known as ' bad ' cholesterol – in almost a third of people already taking statins			1
in people unable to tolerate statins , @entity5 halved bad cholesterol levels , reducing the risk of these killer diseases			1
statins do n't work for some people , and others experience a host of common side effects including feeling sick , constipation and diarrhoea , muscle and joint pain , and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes			1
the global study of nearly 2,400 people showed more than a third of people given @entity5 saw their level of fats fall to those seen in a baby			1
' @entity5 , when used alongside a statin , will dramatically lower cholesterol , ' lead researcher professor @entity67 , of @entity68 , @entity69 , told @entity70			0
' around 40 per cent of people who took it saw their levels reduce to that of a newborn			2
' he called the drug ' powerful ' and said is likely to reduce the risk of heart disease - but added the risk is not going to be totally abolished			2
' if you take the best dose of statin , you get a 50 per cent lowering of bad cholesterol			2
with @entity5 , you get a 50 - 60 per cent reduction			0
' in combination , you could see a 75 per cent reduction in bad cholesterol levels			2
other drugs that we 've got only give a 20 per cent reduction			0

ldl cholesterol is often referred to as bad cholesterol ' , and statins stop it being produced inside the liver			1
this prevents the arteries becoming clogged with fatty deposits , which could lead to heart attacks and stroke in the long run			2
in july , @entity119 urged @entity120 to offer statins to anyone with a 10 per cent risk of developing heart disease within a decade			0
the advice means 17.5 million adults , including most men aged over 60 and women over 65 , are now eligible to take the tablets , which cost less than 10p a day			0
but leading gps , cardiologists and academics are concerned that not enough is known about side effects which include memory problems , dizziness , type 2 diabetes and muscular pain			2
they point out that very little research has been carried out into these risks and how many patients are affected			0
it has also emerged that six of the 12 experts drawing up the guidelines have financial ties to drugs firms who make statins or similar pills			0
doctors already warn that other side effects also include inflammation of the liver , sore throat , constipation and diarrhoea , nosebleeds and tingling in the hands and feet			2
a total of 2,338 patients who were at risk of high cholesterol or of suffering a heart attack or stroke took part in the study			0
of these 1 , 550 were given @entity5 and a statin , and 788 were given a placebo			0
more than a third of the people given @entity5 saw their bad cholesterol levels fall to less than 0.7mmol per litre of blood within a year			1
this is the same level as a baby , professor @entity67 said			0
' it is the biggest reduction we 've had since statins were introduced , ' he said			0
in the @entity180 , doctors say bad cholesterol levels should be 3mmol per litre of blood or lower for healthy adults			1
people at risk of heart disease or high blood pressure should aim for a cholesterol of 2mmol per litre of blood or lower			1
the drug comes as an injection , which patients administer every two weeks			0
professor @entity67 said they had not discovered any side effects so far , but will keep studying the effects of the drug on larger groups of people			1
currently , he is carrying out a study which will test how much the drug reduces heart attacks and strokes			2
the news follows an ongoing debate over controversial guidelines advising statins should be prescribed to millions more people , which has divided the medical and scientific community			0
in july this year , the @entity119 ( @entity119 ) , the @entity211 watchdog , issued guidance that statins should in future be prescribed more widely - in fact , to almost half of all adults			0
@entity119 advised 17.5 million adults , including most men aged over 60 and women over 65 , are now eligible to take statins , which cost less than 10p a day			0
but doctors argue that it is not appropriate to mass - medicalise the public			0
some believe the side - effects of statins have been massively underestimated			0
this , they claim , is due to an over ‑ reliance on research funded by the pharmaceutical industry , for whom statins have proved to be the single most profitable class of drug ever manufactured			0
they argue that side effects such as depression , cataracts , an increased risk of diabetes and muscle pains could affect anywhere between 10 and 40 per cent of statin users			2
