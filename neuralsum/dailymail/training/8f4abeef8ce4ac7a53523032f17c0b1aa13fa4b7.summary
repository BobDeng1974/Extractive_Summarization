by @entity0 when @entity1 bought her stunning @entity3 house @entity4 eight years ago , she had no inkling of its fascinating film and tv history			1
it was only when she received a call from a location scout who had used the property before that she learnt the six - bedroom mansion was still listed as a potential setting			1
she leapt at the chance to have it captured on camera once again			2
on the box : six - bedroom mansion @entity4 , near @entity18 in @entity19 , has featured on both the big and small screen over the decades ‘ it turned out @entity22 had appeared in several episodes of @entity24 as well as black - and - white films such as @entity26 starring @entity27 , ’ says @entity1			1
it is so well known to @entity24 fans that a coachload of followers came on a pilgrimage to see where scenes were shot			1
the house appears in different guises in five separate episodes of the cult 1960s series , which starred @entity38 as @entity39 and @entity40 as @entity41			2
in a 1967 instalment , called @entity43			2
highly improbable , it is the home of a man called @entity46 , played by @entity47			2
a fight scene takes place on the front lawn , culminating in the character being impaled on a stake			2
@entity1 has gone on to hire out @entity4 , which is set in 12 acres near @entity18 in @entity19 , to several television companies , including the @entity54 , which filmed several episodes of @entity56 there over two weeks in 2008			1
move star looks : the fees from screen appearances has been put back into improving the £ 3.95million property , including the addition of and indoor pool with a hot - tub and sauna a framed photo of the cast and crew standing in front of the house has pride of place in the entrance hall			1
the property was meant to be the home of @entity74 , played by @entity75			2
at the time , @entity74 was the new love interest in the life of the now - departed @entity78 , and the father of sisters @entity81 and @entity82			1
‘ he played a millionaire who lived here , and as @entity78 walked up our sweeping driveway for the first time she said , “ it ’s a palace , ” ’ laughs @entity1			2
‘ @entity89 , who played @entity78 , was lovely , just as you ’d imagine her			0
‘ it was disruptive but we loved having them here			0
they fed us very well – there was a catering van , and always lots of biscuits and an urn of tea on the go			0
‘ on the one occasion we did n’t have access to our kitchen because of filming , they footed the bill for dinner out			0
‘ because it ’s filmed about six weeks in advance , they picked all my daffodils from the garden and replaced them with plastic roses to give it a feel of summer			0
’ famous faces : @entity4 appeared in five episodes of @entity24 , starring @entity38 and @entity40 @entity1 is now selling the house for £ 3.95 million , because of divorce , but she and her children @entity120 , 20 , and @entity122 , 18 , have fond memories of playing host to cast and crew members working on various projects			1
‘ we were invited to the premiere of the film @entity137 , ’ says @entity1 , as she leafs through the scrapbooks she has compiled for each production , including the 2011 movie which starred @entity131 and @entity132 , and including a cameo from @entity134			1
‘ it did n’t get great reviews but it was great for us			0
’ the house was also the scene of a teenage party in another @entity146 film , @entity147 , which also experienced limited success commercially			1
‘ the children were extras , playing party revellers			0
' my daughter got to do some work experience with the art department , which was great as she ’s now studying an art foundation course			0
’ @entity1 explains that hiring the house out pays as much as £ 1,600 a day , the most lucrative job being an advert that was filmed over two days in the kitchen for the food company @entity161			1
all the filming fees and more have been ploughed back in to the property , on which the family has lavished money			0
the swimming pool extension , which includes a water slide , hot tub , sauna and gym , set them back £ 500,000			1
they also spent £ 75,000 installing a three - bay garage and £ 50,000 renovating the two - bedroom lodge cottage			1
more money went on a state - of - the - art kitchen , including a cool room , and they splashed out £ 20,000 on a fountain on the front lawn			1
uncovering @entity22 ’s exciting television career inspired @entity1 to delve further into its past , and after trawling through newspaper archives she found it has another , more dubious , claim to fame			0
on @entity190 , 1823 , the house was the scene of a murder when a local constable was shot by a guest of the people who occupied it at the time			0
‘ the murderer was evading bail over money he owed and had been tracked down to @entity22 by bail clerks , ’ says @entity1			0
‘ the constable was badly injured and later died			0
’ it sounds like a plot twist from one of the many dramas that have been filmed there			0

@entity4 , near @entity18 , @entity19 is on sale for £ 3.95m
six - bedroom mansion has been used on film and tv for decades
it featured on @entity24 in the 60s and on @entity56 in 2008
