by @entity0 last updated at 12:51 pm on 24th november 2011 most people love surprises , but they are agony for @entity3 , who collapses whenever something unexpected happens			1
the 26 - year - old suffers from cataplexy , where moments of extreme emotion cause muscular weakness			1
this can range from a slackening of the facial muscles and weakness at the knees to total collapse			2
@entity16 , anger , excitement and fear can all cause reactions , but for mrs @entity3 her trigger is surprise			1
surprise : @entity3 suffers attacks - which can be triggered by an unexpected phone call - up to 20 times a day simple things like her phone ringing , bumping into an old friend and letters coming through the door have all made her collapse - at its worst up to 20 times a day			1
her extreme form of the condition means she loses control of all her muscles and is paralysed for several minutes			2
although she can hear everything , she can not see			2
mrs @entity3 from @entity39 , said : ' it started off with a very small feeling of falling whenever i laughed at something , and by the end of the week when someone at work told a funny story , i just lost muscle control and fell onto the floor			1
' it 's developed from laughter to shock and surprise			1
i can collapse just because my mobile rings when i 'm holding it			2
' i was shopping in the supermarket a couple of months ago when i bumped into an old friend i had n't seen for about five years			2
' it was so unexpected that i collapsed			2
' with cataplexy you ca n't put your arms out to break your fall			1
you have no control or no way stopping yourself from falling			0
' i 'm covered in bumps , bruises and scars from falls			0
i can hear people when i have an attack but i ca n't see or speak			0
it 's like i 'm paralysed			1
' complete collapse : @entity3 during an attack on holiday earlier this year			1
she can hear but can not move or see during the episodes her husband @entity77 , 35 , who is a lift engineer , knows not to surprise his wife with flowers or chocolates and made sure their wedding in june last year was a low - key affair			1
mrs @entity3 said : ' a surprise party would be my idea of hell			1
if @entity77 has something to tell me , he asks me to sit down first in case i collapse			0
' if he walks into a room and i do n't realise he 's there , it can happen			1
once , i was blow drying my hair with my back to the door			0
he walked in and made me jump			0
i fell face down onto the bed			0
' @entity77 is very good			0
he always tries to catch me when i fall			0
' her symptoms started in february last year , and after her first attack she went to her local accident and emergency department fearing she had suffered a stroke			1
doctors there suggested she see a neurologist , who carried out tests , including a brain scan , before referring her to a specialist sleep clinic at @entity110 in @entity111			0
it was there mrs @entity3 was diagnosed with cataplexy and narcolepsy , which causes excessive daytime sleepiness			1
her condition means she has had to give up her driving licence and her job as a receptionist at a dental practice			0
she said : ' i kept falling asleep on the phone and making mistakes because of the tiredness			0
it was causing a lot of problems so i had to leave			0
' @entity129 were very good and patient , but it was n't working out to anyone 's benefit ' no surprises : @entity3 with her husband @entity77 who knows to warn her of anything about to happen , and who tries to catch her when she falls last @entity138 , the attacks became so severe mrs @entity3 was scared to leave the house on her own and she would use a wheelchair in public			1
she was n't able to cook or have a bath on her own in case she had a cataplectic attack			0
she had to stop exercising because it was too dangerous , causing her to put on more than two stone			0
with medication , her condition has improved and she has started doing voluntary work with the hope of getting a part - time job next year			1
mrs @entity3 said : ' a few months ago , i would n't have thought about the future , but i 'm feeling more positive			1
' when my condition was at its worst , i spent so much time indoors			2
i got bored of watching television so i started reading a lot of books			0
' it 's made me realise i want to be a writer , and now i have my days free to try and make that happen			2
' dr @entity162 , consultant neurologist at @entity110 , @entity111 , and president of the @entity164 , said : ' people with narcolepsy lack a chemical in their brain that regulates sleep , without which they can not stay awake for more than a couple of hours or so			0
' @entity171 is found only in people suffering from narcolepsy			0
' it is triggered by intense emotion , particularly laughter or surprise , as with @entity3 , but occasionally anger or frustration			1
' i have a patient who has a cataplectic attack whenever he gets a good shot while playing golf			0
' cataplexy can be treated with anti-depressants , not because the sufferer is depressed but because these drugs create a chemical state in the brain that inhibits cataplexy			2

@entity3 's cataplexy is triggered by surprise
26 - year - old suffers paralysis during attacks
at her worst , she had to use wheelchair for fear of *injury*
