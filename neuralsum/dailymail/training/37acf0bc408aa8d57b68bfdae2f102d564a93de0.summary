@entity0 has insisted that @entity1 is not a ‘ complicated ’ player after @entity4 ’s new £ 16million signing became embroiled in the first controversy of his @entity7 career			1
@entity8 are investigating allegations of racist abuse against @entity1 after he posted a tweet mocking @entity13 ’s 5 - 3 defeat to @entity14 on sunday			1
questions about the case were prohibited at @entity0 ’s press conference at @entity7 on monday , but @entity0 voiced his support for the former @entity20 and @entity21 star who has scored once in four appearances for his new club			1
@entity0 said he has really enjoyed working with @entity1 since he arrived at @entity4 the @entity25 striker jumps out of the way of @entity28 's shot as @entity4 lost at @entity29 @entity1 will always have an opportunity at @entity4 while he continues to work hard for the club ‘ every player is different , ’ said the @entity4 boss			1
‘ i ’ve really enjoyed working with him so far			1
he ’s a good guy , he wants to do well for the club and he ’s shown he cares enough about the club to devote that time to him			2
‘ for me , he ’s not complicated			2
he ’s a football player who wants to do well in his life and career			2
if he continues to give everything and work tirelessly for the cause there will always be an opportunity here for him			2
@entity0 says @entity1 has already started to gel with his teammates but admits there will be slow progress ‘ it ’s not just @entity1 it ’s the whole group , a new dynamic in the group			1
we lost @entity54 ( @entity55 ) who was a marvellous player , and had to bring in a number of players because that ’s what the depth that the squad needed , we were short last year			2
‘ when there ’s that transition there are little bumps along the way			2
@entity1 was one of a number of players we brought in and it will take time for them to gel with current players			1
it ’s happened here already and it will happen again			2
’ @entity0 claimed that @entity1 is not complicted despite his controversial tweet on sunday @entity0 admitted that gelling new signings like @entity75 will take some time after @entity55 left @entity4 face @entity77 in the @entity78 on tuesday night having lost three of their opening five @entity82 games for only the second time in 77 years			1
the 3 - 1 defeat to @entity29 on saturday was the latest blow to a club that came within a whisker of winning the title last season			1
having made eight new signings in the summer , @entity0 believes it will take time for them to adjust to playing for @entity4			1
‘ what people probably do n’t get is the pressure of playing for such a big club , ’ he added			0
‘ the weight of the jersey here is heavy for most players			0
once you adapt to playing for @entity4 you become clearer in your thinking			1
‘ we do n’t have too many experienced players , it ’s a young group			0
that adjustment takes a little bit of time			0
‘ we ’ve conceded eight goals and the majority of those could have been avoided			0
we started poorly at the weekend			0
there are no easy games at this level , you will be tested physically and mentally at this level			0
you have to be ready to fight and we got caught out in those first seven minutes of the game			0
that ’s something we have to improve on , we must do better			0
@entity0 bemoaned individual defensive errors that have cost @entity4 so far this season @entity0 ' side take on @entity77 , who won 4 - 0 last weekend , in the @entity78 on tuesday ‘ of course it ’s not all smiles , it ’s not a feeling we ’ve been used to			1
but you have to refocus and move on			0
you have to be able to recover quick at this level			0
it ’s my job to ensure confidence is retained within the group			0
‘ it ’s not a great start by any means but that we ’ll improve and my team will get better in the second half of the season			0
‘ we want to win a trophy this season , that is still a key objective for us and this competition gives us an opportunity			1
‘ we ’ve been here before with the club when i first came in here , a lot of new players coming in and that time it was a new manager as well			0
we got to where we wanted to be			0
