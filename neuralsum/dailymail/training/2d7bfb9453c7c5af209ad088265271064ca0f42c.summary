the former world no 1 was stood over his approach to the green in @entity7 when he was alerted to the presence of the primate by caddie @entity10			1
understandably surprised by the animal 's appearance , the 36 - year - old scarpered away from his ball as the muscular baboon skipped past @entity0 and onto the green			1

' "			1
' and i turned around and the thing is galloping towards me			2
i jumped out of the way			0
' my facial expression i 'm sure was caught on camera and probably on the internet already by now			0
it gave me a little bit of a fright as he strolled right by me			0
' @entity0 hit nine birdies during his second round to lead at the @entity2 in @entity7 @entity0 tweeted after the incident ( both above ) and saw the funny side to his reaction after a fine round @entity0 found the funny side when he tweeted : ' couple of things happened to me that have n't happened in a while ...			1
one i shot 63 , and two i let a baboon play thru on the course ' ' the fact that my caddy @entity55 did n't even flinch , makes my reaction look even more pathetic ! ! # @entity57 ' the incident did n't sway @entity0 's form , though , as he finished the round ten over par , extending his lead over @entity62 into the weekend			1
the muscular baboon which scared @entity0 walks along the course in @entity7 the @entity66 had an average opening day on thursday , shooting a one - under par round of 71 , but showed the class which saw him top the world rankings in 2011 , carding a nine - under par 63			1
@entity0 , 34 , made six birdies on the front nine and added three on the back without dropping a shot throughout			2
that was enough to see him move clear of compatriot @entity62 , who had held the overnight lead heading into friday 's play at at the @entity77 in @entity78			2
' it 's been a while since i 've gone really low , ' said @entity0 on the @entity83 website			2
the baboon takes his moment in the spotlight posing for the camera after the incident with @entity0 ' i 've been seeing some signs of a lot of improvement in the last few weeks and some lower rounds in the mid to high 60s , but obviously nine birdies around this place is a great round and something i was very pleased with			1
' i felt very in control			0
it 's been a while since i felt like that			0
everything starts for me when i can feel like i can drive it in the fairway and then give myself some opportunities , and obviously when the putter is warm it 's always one of my best weapons in the bag			0
' despite losing the lead , @entity62 stayed in contention with a round of 70 and now sits two behind @entity0 - with the same gap back to @entity115 @entity114			1
@entity0 keeps a look out for the baboon before finishing the round ten under par and leading the challenge ' i do n't feel i played as solidly as yesterday , ' @entity62 said of his second - round effort			1
' i did n't hit it as well off the tee			0
it would have been nice to have picked up a couple coming in , but six under yesterday and two under today , it 's moving in the right direction and i 'm only two shots behind with two rounds to go			0
' yesterday we read the greens really well but today we over-read them			0
i had seven or eight putts that i hit exactly where i wanted to , but i over-read the borrow			0
hopefully tomorrow they will go in again			0
