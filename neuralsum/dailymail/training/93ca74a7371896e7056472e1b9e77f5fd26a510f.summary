my @entity1 contestant @entity0 has been called a ' deadbeat dad ' by his ex-wife in an explosive interview which also revealed the former tennis pro is friends with show judge @entity8			1
@entity9 , @entity0 's former wife of almost 20 years , told @entity10 on monday night that her ex owes her tens of thousands of dollars in child support for their five children , aged between eight and 15 years of age			1
@entity0 's ex said she feels no bitterness that he has moved on and re-married to @entity17 - his partner on the @entity20 reality show - but she claims that 's when her issues with child support payments began			1
@entity9 also claimed that @entity0 used to coach @entity25 judge @entity24 on the tennis court and that the pair worked together at his @entity29 restaurant @entity30 , in @entity31 , after she split with him			1
' he has known @entity8 , he knows him through tennis , through coaching him , ' @entity9 told reporter @entity33			2
@entity9 claims her concern is that the large sum owning to her has amassed over the past year , which she says ' worries me considerably in that my youngest is only 8 - he has many more years where he needs support from his father			2
' ' the children also have no emotional support from him			0
he does not ring them , nor come and see them , ' she said , adding ' they do not receive a card [ for birthdays ] in the mail , not even a phone call			0
' ' he 's never played an active , massive role in their lives anyway ... but basically his role now is non-existent , he 's pretty much wiped his hands clean of the children , ' @entity9 said			0
happier times : the couple were married for almost 20 years and had five children together ranging in age : their kids are aged between eight years and 15 years of age @entity0 's ex also claimed that the lack of funds has reached a point where it 's ' significantly impacting on the children ' , with the blonde single mother saying she 's speaking on a current affair instead of dealing with the matter privately because ' he has blocked my number and both his childrens ' numbers - the older two girls have phones '			1
@entity9 not only took aim at @entity0 during the interview but also at the @entity99 and producers of @entity25			0
' it seems there is little they [ child support agency ] can do , irrespective of him being in the print that he 's working at three private schools doing tennis , irrespective of his face being on @entity25			2
' they consistently say there is no source of collection , there is no avenue for us to collect revenue , ' she said			0
upset : the blonde single mother says she went on the show for the tell all after @entity0 's allegedly blocked her calls and the numbers of their two eldest daughters making money ? @entity9 said she was most upset because her ex speaks of coaching at private schools but is allegedly unable to pay monies to his children spokesman and general manager for the @entity130 , who over-sees the @entity99 , @entity127 told @entity50 : ' i ca n't talk about individual cases but let me assure you , that we go to great lengths in order to enforce child support obligations			1
' ' we will do whatever it takes to recover that money , ' he added			0
while @entity9 claims she wrote to producers of the show to find out if he was being paid for his appearances to garnish money from his wages , she was left without a response			2
a @entity20 spokesperson told @entity151 in response to @entity9 's claims : ' this is a private matter between the parties involved			0
' @entity20 also refuted the claim , that @entity0 and @entity24 are friends : ' they [ @entity0 and @entity24 ] met for the first time on the program '			0
on tv : @entity9 says there is no bitterness that @entity0 has moved on and re-married recently , to his @entity25 partner @entity17 ( pictured ) friends in high place ? @entity0 's ex-wife also claims the former tennis pro used to coach judge @entity8 , a claim @entity20 refute			1
