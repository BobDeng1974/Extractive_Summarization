when the hearing continues monday , @entity4 's attorney , @entity63 , will ask circuit judge @entity65 to release @entity4 without bond ' unfortunately , the children were at such a young age and had been so traumatized , it presented the prosecution with a problem in terms of the inconsistency of their statements , ' @entity38 said			2

home : they argued over @entity17 's girlfriend , whom @entity4 had allegedly called a ' skank ' and ' w * * * * ' prosecutors added that @entity84 was genuinely fearful of @entity4 , and this led to the argument on june 28 , 2011			1
