the smell of a black truffle has been described as earthy , pungent , euphoric and even sexy			2
these delicacies , which can sell for £ 860 to £ 3,000 ( $ 1,345 to $ 4,700 ) per kilogram , cause the pigs and dogs that hunt them to fall under a frantic spell			1
now researchers in @entity8 have discovered that a ‘ bliss molecule ’ , similar to the trahydrocannabinol ( @entity14 ) compound found in cannabis , may be behind black truffle ’s potent powers			1
a black truffle 's scent has been described as earthy , euphoric and even sexy			2
these delicacies , which sell for £ 860 to £ 3,000 ( $ 1,345 to $ 4,700 ) per kilogram , cause animals that hunt them to fall under a frantic spell the molecule , named anandamide , behaves like the psychoactive ingredient found in majijuana to release mood - enhancing chemicals in the brain , according to a report by @entity29 at the @entity30			1
@entity31 , of the @entity32 , @entity8 , explained that anandamide is also used in humans to trigger the release of melanin			0
scientists have dubbed the compound the ‘ bliss molecule ’ due to the way it can change mood , memory , appetite and depression			1
its creation in black truffles create the plant ’s dark colour			1
these prized culinary ingredients , the researchers found , do not have the required receptors that anandamide binds to , meaning that black no use for the chemical			2
black truffles may have evolved this chemical make - up to encourage pigs and dogs to sniff them out earlier this year , a separate study by dr @entity62 at @entity63 in @entity64 found that truffles owe their unique smell and flavour to dirt			1
the research team said that bacteria from the surrounding soil becomes trapped inside the truffles as they grow , creating their distinctive smell			0
the compounds produced by the bacteria , which contain high levels of sulphur , can also be detected by humans causing their highly desirable flavour			0
truffles are the fruiting body of a family of fungi that grow underground in a mutually - beneficial relationship with tree roots			2
they are notoriously difficult to cultivate and there have been attempts to grow truffles in the @entity90 and other parts of the world but it is thought they need the right mix of minerals , soil , bacteria and trees to be successful			0
research from @entity8 has shown that truffles can only reproduce sexually - which makes them distinct from other fungi that can only self - fertilise and reproduce asexually			2
instead , they believe that black truffles may have evolved this chemical make - up to encourage animals such as pigs and dogs to sniff them out , @entity103 says			1
it may sound counterintuitive , but the fungus ’ tiny spores are spread over a wider area if the anandamide - intoxicated animal eats the truffle , rather than if it is left alone			1
the team now want to look at whether whether white , burgundy and @entity119 truffles have also evolved the chemical profile			0

the research team said that bacteria from the surrounding soil becomes trapped inside the truffles as they grow , creating their distinctive smell			0
the compounds produced by the bacteria , which contain high levels of sulphur , can also be detected by humans causing their highly desirable flavour			0
researchers also found that high levels of these aroma producing bacteria lead to the truffles having a far shorter shelf life as they break down the fungi			0
they hope to use their results to find ways of predicting how long a truffle might last on the shelf once dug up			0
researchers in @entity8 have discovered that a ‘ bliss molecule ’ , similar to the trahydrocannabinol ( @entity14 ) compound found in cannabis ( pictured ) , may be behind black truffle ’s potent powers			1

black truffles cause hunting pigs and dogs to fall under a frantic spell
this is because they contain anandamide - a psychoactive ingredient
it works in similar way to @entity14 compound in cannabis to *improve* mood
it also tricks animals into eating the truffles and dispersing their spores
