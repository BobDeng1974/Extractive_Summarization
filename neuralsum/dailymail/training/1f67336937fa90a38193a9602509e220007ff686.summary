by @entity0 an ostrich - sized bird that is capable of disembowelling a human with its claws has been spotted on the loose in the @entity6 countryside			1
the @entity8 rhea , which stands six feet tall and can run at 40mph , has been on the run since it fled its home in @entity11 a month ago			1

a runaway rhea that fled its @entity11 home four weeks ago was spotted in a field at @entity21 on sunday really hard to spot : the six - foot bird has been on the run for a month			1

he said : ' in the distance i saw what appeared to be a large bird , and the closer i got the more perplexed i got			0
' initially , i thought it was a crane , but as i got closer , i realised it was n't a crane , and i wondered if it was an emu			0
' the bird was trotting along just a couple of metres off the road in the edge of a field , and as i got closer it kept looking over its shoulder at me			2
' i think the rhea was as amazed to see a cyclist as i was to see a rhea			0
' by the time mr @entity15 had pulled out his phone to take a picture , the bird had trotted 40 or 50 metres into the field			1
he said : ' you can see the bird standing in a couple of the shots , in the others it was grubbing around in the rape field for food , or perhaps it was trying to bury its head in the sand			2
big bird : the runaway rhea was also photographed near @entity35 on thursday by cyclist @entity15 mr @entity15 took these two pictures with his mobile phone after the bird trotted off into a field of oil seed rape ' it was about six feet high with its head up			1
' on sunday , civil engineer @entity28 , 37 , saw the bird in a field near the village of @entity36 where he lives			1

@entity104 , master of the @entity105 which has its hunt kennels at @entity35 , told @entity108 that members of the hunt had seen the rhea trotting away when they hunted a trail through a field near the bird 's home			2
she said : ' we were n't very near it and the hounds did n't go anywhere near it but some people told me they 'd seen what they thought was an ostrich trotting through a field			0

' @entity133 , @entity11 police spokesman , said three sightings had been reported to police , the most recent of which was @entity36 on sunday			2
the rhea 's owner said it was spooked by the hunt , but @entity105 hunt master @entity104 said the hounds did n't go near its field he said capturing the animal was the owner 's responsibility but said the police would help if it posed a danger to the public			2
a spokeswoman for the @entity150 said it was urging anyone who spots the bird to get in contact with them , while a bird expert warned the public to keep away			0
he said : ' they look nice but they are so strong it 's unbelievable			0
they are n't listed as a dangerous animal but can kill you with one strike of their feet because their claws are six inches long			0
' they will also go for your eyes with their beak			0
' flightless but strong : rheas are native to @entity8 and can live up to 40 years the @entity174 , also known as @entity174 or ' @entity175 ' is native to @entity8 and often called the @entity8 ostrich			1
in the wild , they live in the pampas regions where it is hot in summer and very cold in winter , which means they are ideally suited to the changeable @entity183 climate			0

they are omnivores but mainly eat insects , shoots , leaves and grasses			0
