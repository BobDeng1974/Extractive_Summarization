by @entity0 instead , the search will enter a new phase with the focus on the ocean floor - despite there being no ' pings ' from what was earlier hoped were the aircraft 's black boxes			1
mr @entity10 said that as the aircraft , which had 239 people on board , has been missing for 52 days , if there had been any debris from the aircraft it would have now sunk			1
he paid tribute to the ' tremendous work ' of air crews from eight nations who have contributed to the search			0
his words were seen as virtually admitting that the search had little prospect of finding the aircraft , particularly as a concentrated hunt by the undersea search vehicle @entity44 - 21 in a ' likely area ' had found nothing			0
adding to the mystery is the testimony of sea current experts that anything that floats is likely to have washed up on rocks or a beach somewhere			0
but nothing has turned up and air and sea searches have also failed to find even a slick of oil that could be linked to the missing plane if it had plunged into the sea			0
@entity61 's prime minister , mr @entity60 , conceded in an interview that investigators had made no substantial progress since march 28 - the date experts calculated from satellite data the plane crashed into the @entity67			1
' that 's all we have until today , ' mr @entity60 told the @entity71			0
@entity74 submarine @entity72 concluded its work searching for the black box of the missing plane on friday flying officer @entity78 is pictured aboard the @entity81 e- @entity80 aircraft during the search for wreckage of @entity22 searchers for missing @entity22 face tough choices on how to proceed after almost seven fruitless weeks , with only a fraction of a deep - sea zone still left to be scanned earlier , the former prime minister of malaysia , dr @entity88 , questioned whether @entity22 had even crashed into the @entity67 - and he blamed manufacturer @entity89 for its fate			1
he also suggested the reason passengers and crew did not act to stop whatever was happening on the @entity89 aircraft after it had taken off from @entity96 was because they were ' somehow incapacitated			2
' in an opinion piece , dr @entity88 , who maintains a strong influence in @entity61 's ruling party , said there was no chance , as had been suggested , that the pilot had committed suicide			1
' even if the pilot wants to commit suicide , the co-pilot and the cabin crew would not allow him to do so without trying something , ' said the former prime minister			1
' but no - one , not even the passengers did anything			0
' dr @entity88 also questioned why no debris or oil slick from the plane has been found			2
' can it be that the plane remained intact on crashing and sank with no trace and no - one launching the lifeboat doors as we are told all these aircraft are equipped with ? ' can one believe this plane quietly floated down into the raging sea and sank conveniently in the deepest part of the @entity67 ? ' he said it must have taken some effort if the pilot , captain @entity22 , had disabled the plane 's communication system			1
' the co-pilot would notice and for his own life he would have tried to do something			0
' @entity61 prime minister @entity60 ( left ) has conceded that no progress has been made in the search for the missing plane since the search began			1

' ' the loss of the plane is due to the makers , @entity89			0
how can @entity89 produce a plane that is so easily disabled ? ' in an era where passenger planes can be tracked on mobile phones and spy satellites operated by some countries are able to photography and identify a single person on the ground , @entity89 had to explain how all these methods of tracking the aircraft ' can be disabled , can fail			2
' the former prime minister 's controversial comments did not end there			2
' @entity163 technology is poor or it is not fail - safe			0
' i would not like to fly in a @entity89 aircraft unless @entity89 can explain how all its systems can fail or be disabled			2
' @entity89 , he said in his blog post , must demonstrate how the communication system could be disabled			0
the company , he added , ' must accept responsibility for building an aircraft that can disappear in mid-air so completely			0
' insisting that @entity24 were not to blame for the tragedy , he said it was standard practice that when a plane crashes , a team of experts would arrive at the scene soonest so as to find the cause of the crash ' @entity89 and the authorities in the manufacturing country should be looking out for the plane			2
' maybe the plane type should be grounded			0
but @entity89 has shown no interest and had said practically nothing			0
