prime minister @entity0 has refused to be drawn in to the baby @entity2 surrogacy scandal , saying federal law should not ' intrude into the bedroom '			2
mr @entity0 was asked whether rules should be tightened to stop convicted criminals from obtaining a child via a surrogate			2
the @entity10 father at the centre of the scandal , @entity13 , is a convicted child sex offender			1
he was also pressed on on @entity16 's @entity15 about whether legislation should be changed so parents desperate to have children do not find themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous agencies in countries like @entity23 , where @entity2 is currently in hospital			1
‘ the law should n’t intrude into the bedroom , ' he said			0
' this is a difficult and complex area			0
we have to enforce the laws of the country			0
these are state laws and i do n't want to complicate the matter further			0
' i can completely understand the desire of people to become parents and the desperate measures they will go to			0
but if it ’s illegal in @entity23 , it should n’t be done ( surrogacy )			0
' do n't do anything illegal or you will suffer the consequences			0
' his comments come as it was claimed the @entity23 surrogate mother at the centre of the controversy could face charges in @entity23			1
@entity23 medical authorities are threatening to take action against @entity32 , 21 , as the @entity57 and other agencies crack down on medical institutions and clinics linked to the commercial surrogacy the ministry calls ' illegal '			1
ms @entity32 was paid a total of $ 16,000 to be the surrogate mother of @entity2 , seven months old , who was then allegedly abandoned by @entity13 and @entity65 ' i have never lied or hidden anything			1
the truth is the truth ; it 's up to society to make their own judgment , ' ms @entity32 told @entity72 ( @entity72 )			1
it has also been reported @entity2 's @entity10 father was a convicted paedophile			1
' personally , when i heard the news i was shocked but i ca n't say anything much right now , ' ms @entity32 said at a press conference in her hometown , adding she would ' leave it to the law ' to see if she could get the girl back			1
but despite the threat of the @entity23 law working against ms @entity32 in her home country , it could be the exact opposite here in @entity86			1
it is alleged the @entity10 couple abandoned @entity2 to his fate after they found out he had down syndrome and a congenital heart condition professor @entity93 , a surrogacy law expert at @entity95 's @entity94 , said ms @entity32 could seek custody of the daughter through the @entity10 courts			1
' she 's a legal parent			0
if she turned up in the @entity99 tomorrow , she could seek the return of that child , if that 's what she wanted , ' @entity93 told @entity103			0
meanwhile , seven - month - old baby @entity2 is receiving treatment at a @entity106 hospital , where he is being treated for a congenital heart condition			1
a spokesman for the hospital said the baby was now receiving specialist care and is ' in safe hands '			0
initially @entity13 and @entity65 told the @entity16 they had no knowledge of the other child , but a statement released on tuesday said they were told of the baby 's existence but that it had a congenital heart condition and was not expected to live			1
the case has spurred widespread debate , putting @entity23 under the spotlight because of its weak legal framework overseeing surrogacy and in vitro - fertilisation ( @entity123 ) laws			2
@entity23 law firm @entity125 and @entity126 , which says it will cover surrogacy and @entity123 cases on its website , warns of possible ' complicated legal issues '			0
' while surrogacy in @entity23 is currently an option and a rapidly - growing area of medical innovation , there are a number of legal considerations prospective parents should consider , ' the firm told @entity140			2
the lawyers said @entity23 currently has no laws or published case decisions directly relating to the practice of surrogacy , ' and in essence surrogacy is neither legal nor illegal in @entity23 '			2
agencies and health clinics openly engage in locating surrogate mothers and egg donors			0
' @entity23 's @entity152 has taken a cautious approach to the practices of @entity123 implantation , egg donation , and surrogacy ; these practices are still in a legal and medical " grey area " , ' the firm said			2
investigations are now under way by @entity23 's @entity162 in healing under the @entity163 ( @entity164 ) into the surrogacy service clinics			2
there are reported to be an estimated 20 surrogacy agencies , most said to be foreign - owned drawing in an estimated $ 133 million annually .			0
