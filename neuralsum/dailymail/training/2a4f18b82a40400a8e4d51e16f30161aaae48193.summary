the @entity1 can not be treated like an open all hours @entity3 store , doctors warned yesterday			0
they claimed plans for seven - day services were wasteful and could even threaten patient safety			2
outpatient clinics and routine operations on saturdays and sundays would lead to similar services being cancelled in the week , according to the @entity10			1
it says the strategy is wholly unrealistic because it will intensify demand without providing any extra cash to meet it			0
@entity15 fear that opening surgeries on saturday and sunday without extra resources will not work , file photo dr @entity19 of the @entity10 said this move would require services scaled back at other times @entity19 , chairman of the @entity10 ’s council , said : ‘ the @entity10 has been clear in its support for better seven - day services , but the government needs to be clear about what an expansion of services will look like and , crucially , how it can be safely staffed and resourced , without existing services being scaled back			1
doctors already work around the clock , 24/7 , so the existing [ salary ] contract is not a roadblock to seven - day services			2
’ the @entity10 makes its opposition clear in evidence given to a review of doctors ’ pay in the event of a seven - day @entity42			1
‘ there have been suggestions likening providing @entity42 services over seven days to @entity3 supermarkets opening seven days a week ; these take no account of the challenges faced by the @entity42 in implementing seven - day services , ’ it says			1
‘ indeed even supermarkets do not operate at full capacity or offer a full suite of service throughout the day , seven days a week			1
’ offering a full range of @entity42 services at weekends is ‘ neither desirable nor feasible ’ and the costs of implementation would outweigh the benefits			0
the @entity10 says it is important to tackle the ‘ weekend effect ’ whereby death rates go up in hospital on saturdays and sundays			2
but it says this should not mean having to fund extra services just because it is more convenient to patients			0
sir @entity65 , pictured , @entity64 's medical director is committed to a seven - day gp service making a consultant work weekends would entail finding a replacement during the week to avoid putting patients at risk , the @entity67 says			1
‘ we believe that pursuing an ill - informed seven - day service model would be at best wasteful for the @entity42 and at worst threaten patient safety , ’ adds the @entity10 submission published yesterday			1
@entity64 has pledged to start offering a wide range of services on all seven days of the week to improve the care patients receive at weekends , and also to better fit in with patients ’ working lives			0
when he made the commitment in 2013 , sir @entity65 , @entity64 ’s medical director , said the dramatic expansion would cover much more than simply emergency care , which is already close to a 24/7 service in many places			0
‘ it is also about access to doctors , diagnostics and elective operations so people do not have to miss work to get healthcare , ’ said sir @entity65			0
‘ if someone needs a day - case operation , why ca n’t they have that on saturday , recover on sunday and be back to work on monday ? ’ the professor wants hospitals to have access to x-rays , ultrasound scans and emergency general surgeries at weekends and believes mental health and community care services also need to be available 24/7 if the expanded role is to work			0
@entity64 said 2015 would see ‘ significant progress ’ toward the goal of a seven - day service			1
the @entity111 said : ‘ patients expect to receive the same standard of care regardless of the day of the week			0
a seven - day @entity42 service will speed up diagnosis and discharge times as well as reducing the amount of time patients need to spend in hospitals at weekends			2

the @entity10 is opposed to a seven - day gp service
it feared a seven - day service would see similar clinics shut during the week
the @entity10 warned supermarkets do not offer a full seven - day service
