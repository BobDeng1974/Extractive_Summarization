by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 we had seen the celebration before : teeth gritted , fists clenched , arms whirling like propellers demanding one more effort			2
when @entity11 , who on monday was spotted sporting a jumper emblazoned with @entity14 's image , emerged from a huddle of cavorting red shirts to salute the @entity17 , having just given his team - mates an emotional call to arms , memories of that heady night in @entity10 nine years ago came flooding back			1
that night , you will remember , he scored the first goal in @entity24 ’s logic - defying comeback against @entity25 in the @entity27 final with a terrific header then implored those supporters who had travelled to @entity30 to raise themselves			1
@entity11 catapulted himself into realms of legends in the @entity88 and cemented his position 12 months later with another performance against @entity91 in the @entity93 final that was trademarked by @entity94			1
should he lead @entity24 to the title this season , and crown an extraordinary career with the one gong that has proven so elusive , he will have to be recognised as the greatest player of the @entity59 era			1
remember this ? @entity11 's celebrations after the @entity48 win were reminiscent of those after @entity24 won the 2005 @entity27 in dramatic circumstances against @entity25 in @entity10 comeback : with @entity24 trailing 3 - 0 at half - time , @entity11 inspired the turnaround with this header shortly after half - time heroic : @entity11 lifts the @entity27 after @entity24 's dramatic comeback was completed with victory in the penalty shootout boy 's own stuff : @entity11 fired home from range in the last minute of the 2006 fa cup final to salvage a 3 - 3 draw with @entity91			1
@entity24 went on to win the @entity93 on penalties cup of cheer : @entity11 holds the @entity93 aloft after his heroic performance in the 2006 final the competition for that accolade is huge when you consider the candidates			1
@entity129 , for instance , was the most complete striker this country has seen , an exhilarating blend of speed , skill and strength , who led @entity136 ’s line with class and distinction			1
@entity139 was a goal - machine who carried @entity142 to the title in 1995 , served @entity144 proudly , then immortalised himself on his native @entity145 with his exploits for @entity66			1
he would have won more medals going elsewhere but his reputation was never diminished			0
then there is @entity150 , who has been a fixture in the @entity59 since its inception , a man who has a personal trophy cabinet that many clubs would pay king ’s ransom for			1
he is now 40 but remains @entity158 ’s best player			2
others deserve , of course , mentioning			0
@entity161 and @entity162 ; @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 ; @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168			0
all these men have made unforgettable contributions to the @entity172 game and defined their stellar careers with silverware			0
magician : @entity129 illuminated the @entity59 with his breath - taking pace and spectacular goals prolific : @entity139 is the @entity59 's top goalscorer with 260 for @entity142 and @entity66 longevity : @entity150 has played in every season during the @entity59 era for @entity158 yet should @entity11 , who has reinvented himself this season as a deep - lying midfielder and is flourishing in the role , win the league , he would stand apart			1
for all that @entity186 and @entity187 have been sensational , do not mistake that @entity11 is the driving force in this title charge and he is performing with the same grit and hunger that was so evident on the road to @entity10			2
you only needed to see him charging into tackles and bombing forward against @entity48 to realise how much this means to him			0
it was captured , perfectly , in that huddle , when he called his team - mates together and implored them to remain focused as they close in on history			0
pure emotion : @entity11 wiped away the tears before delivering a stirring post-match team talk to his players leader : @entity11 delivered an impassioned speech saying the players needed to keep their feet on the ground he has hit a number of @entity24 landmarks recently , leapfrogging @entity211 in the list of all time scorers and moving alongside @entity214 and @entity215 on 665 appearances , but the one that he craves most of all , the one he has chased since he emerged as a spindly - legged 18 - year - old , is ending the drought that goes back to 1990			1
' you know what i said to those players in that huddle , ’ @entity11 said			2
‘ i think the important thing now is not to get carried away by that result			0
we need to stay calm , focused and we ’ve got all week to prepare for @entity64 , they are fighting for their lives			0
' we showed that against @entity233 , @entity91 and @entity234 , on our journey that those teams are just as tough			0
the scenes were and obviously the fans are very happy			0
but we ’ve got the day off tomorrow and then we get ready for @entity64			0
’ and that is typical @entity11 , never switching off until the job has been done			2
it is why , as a talent , he has been incomparable .			0

@entity11 spotted *relaxing* with wife @entity243 after @entity71 heroics
midfielder *basking* in the sunshine while out and about in @entity36
winning @entity59 at @entity24 would be his crowning *achievement*
@entity11 would be regarded as better than @entity129 , @entity139 , @entity251 as greatest player competition has seen
