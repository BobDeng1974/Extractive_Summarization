by @entity0 published : 10:11 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 13:39 est , 21 march 2013 a two - foot high robot with flashing eyes could be the key to helping children cope with autism			1
researchers at @entity7 have tested their creation , called @entity9 , on @entity10 , a three year old diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder - and say it could help treat thousands with the condition			1
the robot is able to speak , move and interact using a series on sensors - and can even tell where @entity10 is looking that 's to a specially developed cap			2
writing in the march issue of the @entity42 on @entity43 , the researchers report that children with @entity39 paid more attention to the robot and followed its instructions almost as well as they did those of a human therapist in standard exercises used to develop joint attention skill			1
' this is the first real world test of whether intelligent adaptive systems can make an impact on autism , ' said @entity54 , who directs the @entity55 ( @entity56 ) at @entity7 ’s @entity57			0
the researchers built an ' intelligent environment ' around @entity9 , a commercial humanoid robot made in @entity60 , whose control architecture was augmented for the purpose			1
the setup allowed the researchers to test the relative effectiveness of the robot - based system and human therapists in joint attention training with a dozen 2 - to 5 - year - old children , six with @entity39 and a control group of six typically developing children			1
they alternated short human - led and robot - led training sessions and compared how the children performed			1
@entity9 the robot being used in tests with autistic children the small robot stands on a table at the front of the room , and flat panel displays are attached to the side walls			1
the chair where the child sits faces the front of the room and is high enough to put the robot at eye level			2
the room is equipped with a number of inexpensive web cameras that are aimed at the chair			0
their purpose is to track the child ’s head movements , so the system can determine where he or she is looking			2
to aid in this effort , children in the study wore a baseball cap decorated with a strip of led lights that allowed the computer to infer where they are looking			2
the robot has been programmed with a series of verbal prompts , such as “ look over here ” and “ let ’s do some more , ” and gestures such as looking and pointing at one of the displays , that imitate the prompts and gestures that human therapists use in joint attention training			0
the trials begin with a verbal prompt that asks the child to look at an image or video displayed on one of the screens			0
if the child does n’t respond , then the therapist provides increasing support by combining a verbal prompt with physical gestures such as turning her head or pointing			0
when the child looks at the target then the therapist responds with praise , such as telling the child , ' good job			0
' researchers found that the children in both groups spent more time looking at the robot than they spent looking at the human therapist			1
during the human - led sessions , the children in the control group spent significantly more time watching the therapist than the children with @entity39 did			0
in the robot - led sessions , however , both groups spent about the same amount of time looking at the robot			0
aiden with the sensor - laden hat used to track where he is looking nao the robot being used in tests with autistic children			1
the webcam next to the robot is used to work out where the child is looking ' the children ’s engagement with the robot was excellent , ” said @entity170 , ' and we saw engineer @entity172 began the project six years ago , when visiting his cousin in @entity175			2
@entity172 learned that his cousin ’s son had been diagnosed with @entity39			0
' after i learned something about autism , it occurred to me that my research could be valuable for treating @entity39 , ' he said .			0

researchers created the robot , called @entity9 , to help teach @entity21 social skills
hopes *similar* system could help thousands of children adapt to their condition
