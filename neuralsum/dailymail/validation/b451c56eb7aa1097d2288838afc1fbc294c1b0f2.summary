the prime minister accused the @entity5 leader of heading a ' bunch or hypocritical , holier - than - thou , hopeless , sneering socialists ' - but admitted the @entity14 is on a ' knife edge '			1
addressing activists at the conservative spring conference in @entity20 , the @entity17 leader sought to cast the contest as a personal battle and suggested his counterpart ' has n't got it '			1
but he coupled his promise of better healthcare with a blistering personal attack on mr @entity3 , warning that the @entity5 leader was not up to the demands of leading the country			1
' now five years in this job teaches you some things			0
i know what this role needs - and frankly , i do n't think @entity3 has it , ' he said			1
' some might say " do n't make this personal " , but when it comes to who 's prime minister , the personal is national			0
' the guy who forgot to mention the deficit could be the one in charge of our whole economy			0
' the man who is too weak to stand up to the trade unions at home could be the one facing down our enemies abroad			0
' the leader who thinks leadership is climbing aboard the latest bandwagon - he could be the one taking the make - or - break calls in the middle of the night			2
' the prime minister ( pictured with wife @entity29 ) said that under mr @entity3 , @entity5 was no longer the party of working people , having betrayed its traditional values thumbs up : mr @entity0 delivered his first major rallying speech since mps left @entity78 for the campaign trail mr @entity0 said that only he or mr @entity3 could enter no 10 after may 7 - as he accused the @entity5 leader of planning to ' crawl up @entity6 on the coat - tails of the @entity8 '			1
he said that under mr @entity3 , @entity5 was no longer the party of working people , having betrayed its traditional values			2
' the truth is that @entity3 's @entity5 is n't about liberating working people - it 's about telling you what to do , ' he said			1
' the same old condescending , bossy , interfering , we - know - best attitude of the @entity90 socialist down the ages			0
' on the @entity34 , he acknowledged that gaining access to healthcare services outside normal working hours was ' too hard ' but pledged that would change under a @entity17 government			1
' for years it 's been too hard to access the @entity34 out of hours			2
but illness does n't respect working hours			0
heart attacks , major accidents , babies - these things do n't just come from nine to five , ' he will say			0
mr @entity0 ( pictured arriving at the conference with wife @entity29 ) said that only he or mr @entity3 could enter no 10 after may 7 the @entity17 leader sought to cast the contest as a personal battle and suggested @entity3 ( pictured at the launch of the @entity5 general election campaign ) ' has n't got it ' ' and the truth is that you are actually more likely to die if you turn up at the hospital at the weekend			1
some of the resources are not up and running			0
the key decision - makers are n't always there			0
' with a future @entity17 government , we would have a truly seven day @entity34			1
' already millions more people can see a gp seven days a week , but by 2020 i want this for everyone with hospitals properly staffed , especially for urgent and emergency care , so that everyone will have access to the @entity34 services they need seven days a week by 2020 - the first country in the world to make this happen			2
' mr @entity0 delivered his first major rallying speech since mps left @entity78 for the campaign trail surrounded by giant posters featuring party slogans at the old @entity140 studios			1
the @entity17 have been on a drive to win back the voters in the north of @entity144 it needs if it is to secure an overall majority on may 7			2
however the plan came under attack from doctors ' leaders who accuse the prime minister of ' shameless political game playing '			0
dr @entity152 , who chairs the @entity154 council , said the @entity17 had not even committed the funds needed to maintain existing services			2
' the £ 2 billion extra funding that has been pledged falls far short of what is needed to deliver existing services , let alone fund additional care , ' he said			0
' the @entity34 is recovering from one of the worst winter crises on record , during which some hospitals were forced to close their doors because they could n't cope			2
' with existing services stretched to breaking point , a majority of hospitals facing crippling budget deficits and frontline staff under extreme pressure , the @entity34 needs far more than just words to deliver extra care			2
@entity0 and wife @entity29 talk to urology clinical director mr @entity175 ( left ) during a visit to the @entity177 before speaking at the @entity178 ' without a detailed , fully - costed plan to provide the staff and resources needed to deliver more seven - day services , this is at best an empty pledge and at worst shameless political game playing with the @entity34 ahead of the election			1
' before the @entity150 took to the stage , chancellor @entity186 pushed his vision of a ' @entity189 ' including considerably enhanced powers for local authorities in @entity20 , under an elected mayor			1
and he took the chance to twist mr @entity3 's words from thursday 's televised election grilling into a barb at the expense of the opposition leader			1
' i was listening to @entity3 , with all that legendary statesmanship of his , saying " hell , yeah , i 'll be a leader " , ' he said			2
' i 'll tell you where that leads : a return to rising unemployment ; a return to rising debts ; a return to economic chaos			0
' @entity209 ? yes indeed			0
' @entity5 's campaign vice chair @entity210 accused the conservatives of misleading voters , saying their spending plans would mean " extreme " cuts to the @entity34			1
mr @entity0 's speech was briefly interrupted by a heckle from audience member @entity217 who said he shouted : ' you have betrayed this country on immigration and @entity222 ' ' on the @entity34 , @entity0 misled people in 2010 and he 's misleading them again today , ' she said			1
' when he pledges seven - day - a - week care in the @entity34 , people will remember that he did exactly the same before the last election , only to break his word			1
after five years of the @entity230 it 's harder to see your gp and a&es are in crisis			2
' a @entity235 spokesman said that @entity144 already had plans in place to move towards hospitals and gps being open seven days a week			0
' to keep this sustainable we need to back the @entity34 with more investment			0
only the @entity235 have a credible plan to invest the £ 8 billion per year by 2020 that @entity34 bosses say is needed , ' the spokesman said			0
@entity245 health spokesman @entity244 said : ' if the @entity230 were serious about the @entity34 they would have brought these changes in over the last five years they have been in government , but instead they have degenerated the @entity34 beyond all recognition			1

' mr @entity217 , from @entity267 , @entity268 , explained he was a @entity17 party member but had voted for @entity245 at the last general election and said he held mr @entity270 personally responsible for its rise because of ' a botched up in - out referendum '			1
he said : ' i think he ( @entity0 ) is a fudged leader			2
he has not addressed the most important issue that this country faces which is immigration and the relationship with the @entity279			0
' there is no hope of renegotiating free movement of people			0
we need to control our own borders			0
we need to leave the @entity279			0
