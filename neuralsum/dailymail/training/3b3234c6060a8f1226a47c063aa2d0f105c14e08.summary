by @entity0 published : 10:21 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 04:30 est , 28 september 2013 the @entity1 and @entity2 said they had made the ' very personal ' decision to have their son , @entity4 , christened in the chapel where prince @entity8 's mother 's body lay before she was buried			1
in a break with @entity12 tradition , the couple have chosen to hold an ‘ intimate ’ ceremony at the @entity14 of @entity15 - where the body of @entity17 , lay before the altar for a week before her burial in 1997 so her family could pay their last respects			1
only closest family and friends will be present at the christening , which will take place on october 23 , conducted by the archbishop of @entity29 , the most reverend @entity28			1
christening : @entity4 was born on july 22 and is third in line to the throne the couple chose the venue over the @entity34 at @entity35 - where prince @entity8 , prince @entity36 , prince @entity37 and @entity38 were all baptised - and the private chapel of the royal residence , where the @entity41 herself was christened			1
it is understood that @entity8 and @entity2 favoured the @entity43 - decorated @entity14 because it is , in the words of one royal aide , ‘ an historic , quite intimate chapel			1
’ ‘ it is something they have been thinking about for some time and they just very much liked personally , ’ they said			0
in a statement last night , @entity53 said : ‘ their @entity56 @entity1 and @entity2 are pleased to announce the christening of @entity4 will take place on wednesday , 23rd october at the @entity14 , @entity15			1
’ the archbishop of @entity29 said he was looking forward to welcoming @entity4 into the ' family of the church ' in a statement released today the couple have long made clear they are n’t sticklers for royal convention : whether it be @entity8 ripping up the suggested 700 - strong guest for his wedding because he ‘ hardly knew anyone on it ’ or their decision to release a family snapshot of @entity4 taken by @entity2 ’s father , @entity72 , instead of a formal portrait following his birth on july 22			1
and the couple have other personal links to @entity15 , where until recently their household was based			1
and in april 2011 , @entity2 chose the chapel to be formally confirmed into the @entity80 before her marriage to prince @entity8			2
the last official royal christening to take place at @entity15 was that of princess @entity84 in december 1988			1
it is likely that the @entity4 will be christened in a replica @entity87 lace gown of that worn by @entity41 @entity91 's eldest daughter in 1841			2
the original intricate lace and satin christening robe was specially crafted for @entity91 , the princess royal , and used by generation after generation of royal infants including @entity8 himself			1
prince @entity100 ’s daughter , @entity99 , was the last royal baby to wear the delicate ensemble in 2004			1
the @entity41 then commissioned an identical handmade copy so the 172 - year historic outfit could be carefully preserved			0
it was made by the @entity41 's dresser @entity105 and her team of dressmakers at @entity35			0
tearing up the rule book : the couple have long made clear they are n't sticklers for royal convention the @entity41 and @entity113 will attend next month ’s christening along with the @entity36 , a grandfather for the first time , and the @entity117			1
@entity2 's family - parents @entity118 and @entity72 – will also be invited along with the godparents , who have not yet been publicly named			0
in line with royal tradition , @entity4 is likely to have six god - parents and among the names in the frame are @entity8 ’s best friend @entity126 , his former private secretary @entity126 and ex-nanny @entity127			2
several of @entity2 ’s friends are also in the running , along with her sister , @entity131 , and brother @entity132			0
the christening will also allow a truly historic family photo to be taken – and released to the public - no doubt delighting the 87 - year - old @entity41			2
the @entity41 and @entity113 will attend next month 's christening of the third in line for the first time in more than a century , three heirs to the throne are alive : prince @entity36 , 64 , prince @entity8 , 31 and new - born @entity4			2
the last occasion such picture was taken was in 1894 when @entity41 @entity91 was photographed with her son @entity100 , grandson @entity145 and great grandson @entity100 the existence of a @entity14 itself dates back many centuries and , originally , was not a building but an establishment : a body of priests and singers to serve the spiritual needs of the @entity156			1
during @entity157 times the @entity14 would follow the @entity156 around the country to whichever @entity15 or great house was in favour at the time			1
since @entity162 burned down in the late 17th century the @entity163 has been based exclusively at @entity15			1
the actual building was originally constructed by @entity165 and decorated by @entity43 in honour of the king 's fourth marriage to @entity169			0
@entity171 's heart is buried beneath the choir - stalls and it was where @entity173 said her prayers for the defence of the realm against the threat of the @entity179 in 1588			0
at the end of the @entity182 , @entity180 also received the @entity183 in the @entity14 at @entity15 before his execution in @entity185 in 1649			1
three special coins will be made to mark the @entity4 's christening , the @entity186 has announced			0
a gold kilo coin , a silver £ 5 coin and a ' more affordable ' £ 5 coin have been approved by the @entity1 and @entity2 , the @entity41 and the chancellor			0
birthday money : this £ 5 coin was previously issued by the @entity186 to mark the birth of the royal baby this will be the first time that new coins have been produced in the @entity201 to mark the christening of a member of the @entity204			1
details of the prices and how many will be created have yet to be announced			0
@entity208 , of the @entity186 , said : ' the @entity186 has celebrated moments of national significance for over 1,000 years and it was felt appropriate to produce the first - ever set of @entity12 christening coins to mark the christening of our future king			0
' as a @entity201 institution , the @entity186 has played a central role creating works of art as official commemorations of landmarks in the history of the @entity204 for hundreds of years			0
these coins will be a fitting addition to that long tradition			0
' a £ 5 silver proof coin has already been issued to mark the birth of the future heir to the throne and other commonwealth countries including @entity230 and @entity231 have also issued coins to commemorate the birth			0
the £ 5 @entity204 coin was priced at £ 80 from the @entity186 , and is currently sold out			0
queen @entity91 was married in the @entity14 , and her marriage certificate , hand - written by the archbishop of @entity29 and signed by both bride and groom , still hangs on the wall in the vestry			1
it is also considered to be the cradle of @entity244 church music			0
among its many noted organists and composers was @entity248			0
one of the @entity14 's most notable organists and composers was @entity251 , who was appointed by @entity252 in 1723 as ' composer of @entity254 's @entity12 '			2
the title was constructed to allow @entity251 , still a @entity256 citizen , to contribute to the musical development of the @entity14 without actually being a member of it			2
though @entity4 is the first member of the royal family to be christened in the @entity14 for 25 years , it has been the backdrop for many royal milestones since its construction in the 16th century			1
built by @entity165 following his short - lived fourth marriage to @entity169 , the chapel at @entity15 is the believed burial site of @entity171 's heart			1
it is where @entity173 chose to remain during the @entity179 in 1588 to pray , receiving updates of the conflict 's progress via fire beacon from @entity276			0
the @entity14 at @entity15 has been the scene of many royal milestones since its construction under the order of @entity165 in 1540 @entity281 within the chapel where @entity4 will be christened later this month queen @entity91 married @entity283 at the @entity14 in 1840 underneath its decorated ceiling which is painted with royal initials and coats of arms			1
her marriage certificate , handwritten by the archbishop of @entity29 and signed both by the bride and groom still hangs in the @entity14 's vestry			1
in 1997 , the coffin of @entity17 lay before the chapel 's altar ahead of her funeral in @entity298			0
at the end of the @entity182 , @entity180 received the @entity183 within the chapel 's walls before his execution in @entity185 in 1649			0
@entity303 and @entity304 leaving the @entity14 with princess @entity84 after her christening in 1988 various changes were made to the building in 1836 with the addition of side galleries and a new ceiling to match the original 1540 ciphers			1
the @entity14 also has a long musical history with many noted organists and composers having performed there			2
queen @entity91 and @entity283 were married in the @entity14 in 1840			2
their marriage certificate still hangs in the chapel 's vestry among the most well known are @entity319 , @entity320 , @entity321 and @entity248 who lived in a suite of apartments within the @entity15			1
it is believed the poet , @entity325 , who was frequently in debt , used to take refuge with @entity248 in his apartments in order to avoid the clutches of persistent creditors			0
one of the @entity14 's most notable organists and composers was @entity251 , who was appointed by @entity252 as ' composer of @entity254 of his majesty 's @entity12 ' in 1723			2
the title was constructed to allow @entity251 , still a @entity256 citizen , to contribute to the musical development of the @entity14 without actually being a member of it			2
@entity251 composed the great anthem ' @entity339 ' for the coronation of @entity252 in 1727			0
the song has been used at every coronation since			0
and is also sung at the @entity344 service in which the @entity41 distributes @entity344 money to elderly members of the church on the day before @entity348			0
the nearby @entity14 was built by @entity349 for the @entity351 bride of his son , later @entity180 , and designed by @entity353 .			2
