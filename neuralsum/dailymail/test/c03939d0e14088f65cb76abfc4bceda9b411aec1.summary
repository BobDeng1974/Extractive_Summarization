demand for rubber to make tyres is having a ‘ catastrophic ’ impact on the world ’ s forests , scientists have warned			2
up to 21 million acres of jungle will be torn down to make way for rubber plantations in the next decade alone , according to researchers at the @entity11			1

endangered species in south east @entity19 at risk lead researcher @entity27 said : ‘ the tyre industry consumes 70 per cent of all natural rubber grown , and rising demand for vehicle and aeroplane tyres is behind the recent expansion of plantations			1
‘ but the impact of this is a loss of tropical biodiversity			0
‘ we predict that between 4.3 and 8.5 million hectares ( 10.6 - 21 million acres ) of new plantations will be required to meet projected demand by 2024			1
the tyre industry consumes 70 per cent of all natural rubber grown , and rising demand for vehicle and aeroplane tyres is behind the recent expansion of plantations ‘ this will threaten significant areas of @entity19 forest , including many protected areas			1
’ she said many protected areas have already been lost to rubber plantations - including three - quarters of the @entity52 in @entity53 , which was cleared for rubber between 2009 and 2013			0
miss @entity55 added : ‘ in @entity53 , forest areas earmarked for further rubber plantations contain critically endangered water birds like the @entity60 , globally threatened mammals like @entity63 ’s deer and @entity64 , and many important primates and carnivores			2
‘ macaques and gibbons are known to disappear completely from forests which have been converted to rubber			0
' our review shows that numbers of bird , bat and beetle species can decline by up to 75 per cent			0
