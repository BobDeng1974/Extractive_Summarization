half of the experts urging the @entity2 to prescribe statins to millions more patients have financial ties to drugs firms making the pills			1
six of the 12 - strong panel have received thousands of pounds from manufacturers – either by being paid directly to give speeches or ‘ advice ’ , or through funding for research			1
this includes the chairman , dr @entity16 , who has been given funds likely to total tens of thousands of pounds from five drugs firms which make statins or similar cholesterol - lowering pills			1
bitter pill : a group of leading doctors yesterday urged the @entity2 to scrap plans to massively increase the use of statins , like the pills pictured , warning that not enough was known about the risks they pose in the long term last night @entity31 urged the health secretary to launch an investigation into the panel ’s links to drugs firms			1
@entity37 , @entity38 ’s shadow health minister , said : ‘ neither big companies nor individuals should stand to personally profit from decisions about our care			0
@entity44 should launch an investigation without delay			0
’ a group of leading doctors yesterday urged the @entity2 to scrap plans to massively increase the use of statins , warning that not enough was known about the risks			2
@entity51 , the @entity2 drugs watchdog , is to issue new guidelines next month which are expected to urge @entity54 to prescribe statins to up to 10million extra patients to prevent heart disease			1
but doctors including the president of the @entity60 , sir @entity61 , as well as senior cardiologists and @entity54 , warned that patients will be unnecessarily exposed to side - effects including diabetes , memory loss and muscle pain			1
they also accused @entity51 of only looking at potentially biased research about the benefits and risks of statins , which had been supplied by the manufacturers			1
@entity16 @entity73 @entity74 it has emerged that the chairman of the @entity51 panel which recommended the increased use of statins , dr @entity16 , a consultant specialising in heart disease at @entity83 and @entity84 , @entity85 , has received thousands of pounds for his research from @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 – which make statins or similar drugs			1
it is not known exactly how much he received but some doctors are given more than £ 10,000 in sponsorship for their research			2
and dr @entity73 , who specialises in cardiology at @entity101 and @entity102 hospitals , has been paid by the firms @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 to give lectures			2
again , dr @entity73 did not disclose the exact amount but manufacturers can pay medics more than £ 5,000 a year and senior nurse @entity111 , who practises at @entity112 and @entity113 , received a year ’s salary from @entity115 who sponsored her job			2
this is likely to have been around £ 30,000 – a typical salary for a specialist nurse – although she is now directly paid by the hospitals			0
@entity111 dr @entity121 @entity122 three other members of the group – dr @entity121 , dr @entity122 and dr @entity74 – all received sponsorship payments or travel expenses from drugs firms making statins			1
a group of senior doctors , including leading cardiologists and @entity54 , has now written to mr @entity44 and @entity51 urging them to reconsider the guidelines			1
around 7million patients in @entity134 currently take statins to prevent heart attacks and strokes			2
they are predominantly given to the over- 65s who have been diagnosed with heart disease or have a high risk of developing it based on their family history or lifestyle			0
but @entity51 ’s new guidelines are likely to advise @entity54 to prescribe statins to anyone with a 10 per cent risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke within the next decade			1
the @entity151 contacted all of the six experts on the panel but had not received responses last night			1
chairman of panel ; consultant at @entity83 and @entity160 ’ hospital , @entity85			1
has received research grants from @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 which all either make statins or so - called new generation cholesterol - lowering drugs			1
cardiologist at @entity101 and @entity167			0
has been paid by @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity91 to give speeches or offer advice			0
specialises in cardiovascular disease at @entity172 of @entity112 and @entity113			0
has been paid by @entity90 and @entity88 to offer advice			0
senior nurse specialising in cardiovascular disease at @entity172 of @entity112 and @entity113			0
the first year of her job at the hospital – from november 2010 to 2011 – was paid for by @entity177 , one of the main statins manufacturers			2
she has also been paid by @entity91 , which also makes statins , to give speeches to nurses			2
consultant at the @entity184 , @entity185			0
has been paid to give advice by @entity187 , @entity90 and @entity188 , which all make statins			2
he was also paid by @entity91 to attend a four - day conference in @entity193 in 2012			2
consultant at the @entity195 , @entity196			0
has been paid by @entity91 , @entity115 and @entity87 to attend meetings and give lectures			0
he also attended a dinner hosted by @entity201 , another drugs giant which makes statins			1
all the experts had declared their conflicts of interest to @entity51			1
by @entity207 , @entity151 doctor expert advice : first and foremost , all the experts agree that people who ¿ ve already had a heart attack or stroke should take a statin , says dr @entity215 yet again statins , the cholesterol - lowering drugs , are headline news			1
yesterday a group of respected doctors warned that a proposal by the @entity2 to give statins to millions of otherwise healthy people would be a mistake			2
their view is that the drugs could do more harm than good – and their concern is that the recommendation to extend the drugs ’ use is based on flawed and biased data about the side - effects			1
so while @entity51 ( the @entity234 ) wants more of us to take statins because of the benefits , leading doctors are very much against this because of the side - effects			1
confused ? no wonder – even doctors find it hard to make sense of the conflicting information about statins			2
but this is what i ’ll be telling my patients			2
first and foremost , all the experts agree that people who ’ve already had a heart attack or stroke should take a statin			0
this is known as ‘ secondary prevention ’ – statins guard against a second such event			0
indeed , statins are one of the key reasons why life expectancy now is so much better than when i entered medicine			0
for any patient who has been through such an event , statins are life - saving			1
but there is a world of difference between this secondary prevention and ‘ primary prevention ’ – and this is where things become controversial			0
primary prevention is where healthy people are given a treatment – it could be a statin , or low - dose aspirin – to prevent a future event : in the case of statins , that is the furring up of the arteries in the heart or brain , which could lead to a heart attack , stroke or perhaps dementia			1
so who should be taking statins as primary prevention ? the draft guidance from @entity51 is that any healthy person with a 10 per cent risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke within the next decade should be on a statin			1
currently it ’s those with a 20 per cent risk who get the drug			0
doctors calculate your percentage risk by adding up your risk factors , such as a history of smoking , obesity , high blood pressure , having a close relative ( a parent or sibling ) who has had a heart attack and high cholesterol			0
it is not an exact calculation , though it ’s a handy tool			0
under the new @entity51 guidance the majority of people aged over 50 would now be on a statin , and this is what is so controversial			1
so if you fall into this group , should you now be taking a statin or not ? this is where you need the clear , intelligent advice from a doctor you know and trust			0
what you do n’t need is a knee - jerk prescription from a doctor following imposed rules			0
and if your doctor says to take a statin , even if you ’re are n’t sure , at least try it for two to three months			0
the fact is that most people suffer no side - effects and their cholesterol levels plummet , which is reassuring , like wearing a seatbelt			0
but nothing – @entity51 guidelines or prescription pills – can ever be as effective in primary prevention as taking the right lifestyle precautions : do n’t smoke , keep to a healthy weight and exercise every single day			1
that will put paid to the statin debate .			0

six of the 12 - strong @entity51 panel have received money from drugs makers
panel chairman got funds likely to total tens of thousands from five firms
@entity51 is set to issue new guidelines telling @entity54 to prescribe more statins
