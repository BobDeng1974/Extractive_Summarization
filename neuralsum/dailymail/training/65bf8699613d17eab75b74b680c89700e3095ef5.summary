by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 's @entity2 proved he is a proper all - rounder at @entity5 on thursday by doing his best @entity7 impression			1
@entity2 , at the centre of the summer 's big controversy following his set - to with @entity10 in the @entity12 pavilion , was playing football in the outfield and struck a pose reminiscent of the @entity16 's control in a match against @entity18 in 2003			1
this piece of control is now a statue outside @entity23 's @entity22			2
maybe @entity2 could be better suited to the other @entity5 after that touch ( with an orange @entity26 ball , as it happens ) , although @entity3 will be hoping he can put his skills to better use with a cricket ball as they look to regain the lead in the series			2
@entity46 chief executive @entity45 said on tuesday he would not be appealing against justice @entity48 ’s decision to exonerate both @entity10 and @entity2			0
@entity3 appealed against the original not guilty verdict as they sought to have @entity10 punished for a @entity52 offence and banned for the rest of the test series			1
that did not happen but @entity39 says that if @entity10 ' carries on being abusive ' he should be punished by the authorities			1
and the @entity3 captain added that match officials should play a greater role in ensuring the game is played in the right spirit : ‘ it ’s important that cricket has strong characters – no matter what side they play for , ' @entity39 said			1
' but what needs to be done is for umpires to step in if the individual crosses the line			0
if the individual stays within the guidelines , it ’s good for the game			0
‘ if he carries on being abusive and can not curb his instincts , he should definitely be punished			0
’ limbering up : the @entity3 players stretch on the outfield prior to their nets session @entity3 , meanwhile , could make three changes to the team who put up so little resistance at @entity82			2
off - spinner @entity83 could play his first game of the series , in place of batsman @entity88 , while fast bowler @entity89 is in the mix , possibly at the expense of the luckless @entity92			0
the tourists could go for experience at the top of the order , too , where @entity97 might replace @entity98 .			0

@entity39 says it 's up to captains to control their players
but @entity3 skipper says match officials should step in if it goes to far
@entity39 *insists* @entity10 should be punished if he carries on with *verbals*
