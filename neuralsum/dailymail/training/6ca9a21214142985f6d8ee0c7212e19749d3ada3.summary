@entity11 native @entity10 , 27 , was posted in the country 's northwestern @entity12 last year to the @entity15 area where he met @entity16 , 19 , while manning a checkpost near her home ' the girl left her home on monday and met @entity10 when villagers saw them , ' said @entity36 , the head of the local jirga , or tribal court , that sentenced @entity10 to death			1
' we took the girl into custody and took the boy to the local graveyard where he was stoned to death and buried			2
' @entity10 was killed on monday , he added			1
a government official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the jirga had ruled the woman must be shot to death			1
it was not immediately clear if this had already taken place			0
the army was not immediately available for comment			0
such tribal justice is a stark reminder of the difficulty in establishing a credible civilian administration in @entity4 's semi-autonomous region bordering @entity64 , despite a series of military operations in the area and @entity69 nations pouring in millions of dollars to help build infrastructure			2
@entity71 , the only part of @entity4 's largely lawless border region that has a significant @entity75 population , is wracked by sectarian violence between @entity78 and @entity75 tribes			1
anti-shi'ite ideology from the @entity80 and @entity81 has meant years of bloody fighting			0
@entity83 is @entity75 while @entity10 was @entity78 , @entity36 added			2
the @entity84 , a @entity75 place of worship , in @entity15 , in @entity71 in the tribal area , @entity4			2
@entity71 is wracked by sectarian violence between @entity78 and @entity75 tribe			1
it is believed @entity83 is @entity75 while @entity10 was @entity78 the @entity91 have never been fully integrated into @entity4 's administrative , economic or judicial system			1
instead , families and tribes often take justice into their own hands , presiding over ' jirgas ' or ' panchayats ' , gatherings of elders that hand down punishments including rape , killing and the bartering of women to settle scores and restore honor			0
in such tribal justice , women often fare far worse than men			0
@entity36 said that the jirga had also requested that another @entity4 soldier , @entity112 , be handed over for helping the couple meet and coordinate the planned elopement			0
' the army is here for our security but if they engage in such activities we will not let them stay here , ' @entity36 said			0
' this is an insult to tribal customs			0
we will revolt against this			0
