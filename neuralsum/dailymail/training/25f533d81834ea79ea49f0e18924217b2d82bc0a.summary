@entity0 has admitted @entity1 will have a massive advantage when @entity3 relaunch their push for a @entity6 place this weekend			1
@entity3 face the reigning champions at @entity8 on sunday but the game will start at 12pm - which is just 57 hours after they return from their @entity13 tie in @entity14			1
@entity0 has been forced to shuffle his pack coming out here to @entity17 , as an ankle injury to @entity20 and his decision to rest @entity18 means he is without 10 senior players , as @entity3 look to protect a 1 - 0 first leg lead			1
@entity0 believes @entity1 will have a major advantage over his @entity3 side @entity3 will not get back from @entity14 until at least 3am on friday and @entity0 is concerned that @entity1 - who faced @entity27 on tuesday - will be fresher and fitter for what could prove to be a decisive game in the battle to secure a top four spot			1
' that extra period of 48 hours that they ( @entity1 ) will have could be crucial , certainly physically , ' said @entity0			1
' especially as we do n’t get back until 3am we will have very little preparation time			2
' it ’ll just be about recovery			2
we can ’ t train on the pitch at @entity8 ( on friday night ) , we ca n’t make it any worse than it is , so we ’re having to train the next day ( at @entity42 )			0
@entity3 will be without key men @entity20 ( left ) and @entity18 for the clash ' sometimes you can get back and train later that day , it does n't help us			1
but look , it ’s the way it ’s been dealt and we ’ll deal with it the best we can			0
the players have had lots of challenges to overcome this season and we are ready to keep performing and doing the best we can			0
' when asked if this showed how difficult the demands of the @entity13 is , @entity0 replied			2
' especially if you do n’t get help , when we are on when we are , early on the sunday			2
it is still a @entity60 competition			0
i would rather be in it than not in it			0
' we are playing a lot of games this season because we had a successful couple of games , we are doing well , we are in a couple of competitions and if we want to maintain that and work well for the coming years we have to get used to a lot of games			0
@entity74 ( right ) in action during a training session at @entity42 on wednesday ' it is unfortunate but we will do our best			0
' @entity0 hopes @entity20 will be fit to face @entity1 , while @entity78 could also feature as his recovery from a hamstring problem has gone smoothly			1
' @entity18 - who scored a stunning goal at @entity82 last weekend - will certainly play as @entity0 felt this was an appropriate juncture to take the @entity85 out , given he has has just made 19 consecutive appearances			1
' i ’ve had to bring out young @entity18 , ' said @entity0			1
' he has n’t travelled			0
he ’ s an outstanding young player for us , a key player for us and he ’s played a lot of game consecutively for us now			0
' this was a game that i ’d earmarked to give some recovery in knowing he can stay at home , not travel and prepare and get ready for the weekend			2
' @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 take part in a sprint drill @entity103 ( left ) and @entity99 will need to be in top form if they 're continue their @entity6 charge			0
