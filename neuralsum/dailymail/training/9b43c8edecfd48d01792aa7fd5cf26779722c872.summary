by @entity0 published : 14:23 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 14:33 est , 3 october 2013 one of @entity2 ’s most controversial and worst - performing rail firms has been granted a 23 - month extension to its franchise by the government			1
passengers have been promised improvements after the @entity5 said @entity8 – dubbed ‘ @entity9 ’ by critics ’ over poor punctuality and chronic overcrowding - will carry on running line until september 2015 before bidding starts for a new long - term franchise			1
critics said the extension was ‘ a scandal ’ and smacked of ‘ rewards for failure on a massive scale			2
’ controversial : the operator dubbed ' worst late @entity8 ' has been granted a franchise extension the @entity23 runs from @entity25 's paddington station out to the @entity26 , @entity27 and south - west @entity28			1
but @entity29 , leader of the @entity31 rail union , said : ‘ @entity8 are being rewarded for failure on a massive scale			0
they have increased walk - on fares by 210 per cent since privatisation , three times faster than the rate of inflation			1
‘ they are also the first rail firm to provoke a strike by passengers in the entire history of the railways , in protest at overcrowding in the @entity46 region			2
’ @entity48 transport union leader @entity47 said : ‘ this is another twist of the rail franchising racket with a company running one of the worst - performing services in the country given a free run to milk this vital inter-city line for all it is worth for another two years			1
‘ we are demanding to know just how much first extracted from the government in last - ditch talks where they had bullied themselves into a monopoly provider position			0
‘ it is a scandal that the publicly - run option was never considered for this franchise even though it would have saved the taxpayer a fortune			2
’ fierce criticism : @entity31 rail union leader @entity29 ( left ) said the deal had ' rewarded failure ' , while @entity48 transport union chief @entity47 ( right ) described the franchising system as a ' racket ' but ministers and rail bosses insisted there would be improvements ’ including greater wi - fi coverage and additional sleep carriages			1
in august furious @entity8 passengers vented their rage after enduring ‘ third world cattle truck ’ conditions ’ and a 12 hour nightmare journey when an overcrowded and ageing train belonging to @entity8 suffered brake - failure			1
they accused the firm of ’ incompetence ’ after nearly 500 passengers were left stranded , thirsty and hungry for almost six hours near @entity89 , @entity90 , on the 30 - year - old broken down train from @entity92 to @entity93			1
passengers described the fiasco as ‘ horrific ’ and a ‘ chaotic disaster ’ and said they were ‘ treated like cattle ’			0
those seeking to slake their thirst were outraged to be charged for hot drinks , said witnesses			0
in july a damning new government league - table of cattle - class services , identified a @entity8 service as officially the most overcrowded service in @entity28 and @entity107			0
it showed that in @entity109 , the 07.44 @entity8 service from @entity111 in @entity112 into @entity93 in @entity25 carried 415 tightly - packed passengers in three carriages designed to carry 225 people in @entity116			2
that meant there were 190 passengers ‘ in excess of capacity ’ and that the train was 84 per cent overcrowded			1
this was worse than the previous check in @entity125 when the same service was 80 per cent overcrowded			0
overall , @entity8 also had the highest level of passengers ‘ in excess of capacity ’ of any @entity25 and south east @entity28 operator in 2012 at 7.1 per cent across both peaks			1
on track : transport secretary @entity132 said the deal proved the new arrangement worked transport secretary @entity132 said the franchise extention was further proof that the government 's new franchising schedule is on track : ‘ the @entity8 franchise provides a vital service for thousands of passengers every day and under this deal they will see real benefits			1
‘ this agreement will provide additional sleeper carriages between @entity25 and @entity147 securing the future of a key service once under threat			0
’ mr @entity132 added : ‘ we have also secured a commitment to deliver greater wi - fi coverage to improve the experience of long - distance journeys for passengers			2
‘ but i am also determined that we see further improvements during the lifetime of this contract ; more standard class and fewer first class seats on key services and the delivery of more electric trains for the @entity165			0
’ @entity8 ( @entity8 ) is the rail - arm of transport giant @entity167 , whose initially successful bid to run the @entity170 was then overturned following a challenge by sir @entity172			1
@entity167 ’s chief executive @entity173 also heads the government ’s ‘ @entity174 ’ set up by ministers to improve services			0
mr @entity178 said : ‘ today 's agreement is good news for @entity8 passengers , taxpayers and our shareholders as it provides continuity and consistency , building on the improvements our experienced team has already made over the last franchise period			0
' we have seen significant improvements in customer satisfaction and punctuality , and working with the @entity193 we have delivered additional capacity on the busiest morning peak trains			0
‘ we will work closely with stakeholders and partners along the route to explore further ways to support our local communities			0
’ @entity201 , chief executive of rail customer watchdog @entity202 , said : ‘ we know that , for most passengers , the key thing is that trains keep running , turn up on time , and that they are able to get a seat			2
’ it is important that this short - term extension is used to prepare and deliver a better , more passenger - focused franchise where the passenger voice has been heard and taken into account			0
