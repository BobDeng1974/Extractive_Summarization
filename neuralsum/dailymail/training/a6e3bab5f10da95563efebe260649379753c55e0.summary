an open - source @entity13 project lets people sitting in front of a webcam 're - skin ' their face as someone more famous , including @entity21 and @entity22 users can pull faces in front of a camera and see themselves react as their favourite celebrity in an effect that is almost like digital plastic surgery			1
the technology works in realtime so that the celebrity mask mirrors a user ’s facial expressions			1
mr @entity57 told @entity58 : ‘ it 's a really eerie effect to “ wear ” someone else 's face when you 're mostly used to seeing your own face in the mirror			1
‘ i noticed that i subconsciously changed my facial expressions depending on which face i was “ wearing , ” which was kind of funny			0
’ the technology works in realtime so that the celebrity mask mirrors a user ’s facial expressions			2
here , president @entity6 's features are super imposed on a user 's face mr @entity57 was inspired to create his software , having seen the work of @entity77 , who also made an app to enable ' facial substitution '			1
here , a user pouts as @entity81 @entity77 also made an app to enable ' facial substitution ' where he shows how a user can pull faces as @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 ( pictured ) while it is reported that the software can struggle to keep a mask in place if a user moves their head too suddenly , it does skew a person ’s sense of self			0
‘ i think a lot of things are coming together right now that makes it possible to change or augment your perception of reality , ’ mr @entity57 said			0
‘ face substitution is one of the things which probably will get much better over time and we 'll see it pop up more places			0
’ mr @entity57 was inspired to create his software , having seen the work of @entity77 , who also made an app to enable ' facial substitution ' where he shows how a user can pull faces as @entity86 , @entity88 , @entity87 , @entity114 and @entity81 , to name but a few celebrities featured in a demonstration video			0
while the technology currently allows users to have fun virtually dressing up as celebrities , including @entity86 , it could pave the way for advanced video chatting services and facial recognition apps users report that the software skews their sense of self and they tend to adopt similar facial expressiosn to those regularly shown by the celebrity whose face they are trying on			1
left , is @entity135 's features imposed on a user 's face , and the star at an event ( right ) he explained in a blog post that fitting a facial model is useful for pinpointing facial features for detecting an emotion or identifying someone			1
the app is based on an algorithm used to fit a facial model to a real face in a video and consists of 70 points or ‘ classifiers ’			0
given an approximate position , the classifiers search a small region around each facial point to get the best fit for the mask			0
@entity41 computer scientist @entity57 created ' @entity42 ' so that a webcam can map 70 distinct points on a person 's face face substitution will get much better over time and will be used in more situations than simply trying on celebrities ' features for fun			1
here , a software demo shows a young man with the @entity22 's features superimposed on his face			1
@entity22 is pictured right mr @entity57 said there is room for improvement , as the app does not fit ' postures ' that deviate from the average very well			2
he said a 3d model instead of a @entity180 one could help to make the software more accurate , but building a 3d model is more difficult			0
if the concept is made to look more realistic , it could perhaps be used as an alternative to real plastic surgery in the future , as people could create their ideal appearance to use online			0
