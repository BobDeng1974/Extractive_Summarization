a battered @entity1 camera bought on @entity2 is believed to have once belonged to missing war photographer @entity3 who disappeared in @entity4			1
@entity3 , the son of @entity6 actor @entity5 , vanished in april 1970 after travelling to the country when the @entity8 spilled into @entity4 when he was 28			1
attempts to find out what happened to @entity3 and fellow @entity12 photojournalist @entity11 , who was also on the assignment , have drawn a blank and he was declared dead in absentia in 1984			1
discovery : a battered @entity1 camera bought on @entity2 ( right ) is believed to have once belonged to missing war photographer @entity3 ( left ) who disappeared in @entity4 however , freelance photographer @entity17 from @entity18 , in @entity19 , south - west @entity20 , has bought what he believes was @entity3 's old @entity23 camera on the online auction site			1
the model , which dates back to the 1960s , has been scratched with the faded initials @entity28 on its base			1
' the camera was said to have been found in a @entity32 flea market and is supposed to have come from @entity33 , which could mean @entity34 , @entity4 , @entity35 or anywhere in that part of the world , ' said mr @entity17 , 71			1
' it was in a pretty bad state , if i ’m honest , which is why i managed to get it for just £ 51			2
' buyer : freelance photographer @entity17 from @entity18 , in @entity19 , south - west @entity20 , has bought what he believes was @entity3 's old @entity23 camera mr @entity17 had been cleaning the camera when he noticed that @entity28 had been carved into it , ' that got me wondering more and more whether it might have once belonged to @entity3 , ' he said			1
' according to the serial number it was built between november 1967 and january 1968 , which is the right time frame , and it is documented that @entity3 — like most @entity8 photographers — did occasionally use a @entity23 ' i then looked up the list of photographers who were killed or went missing in @entity34 and @entity3 was the only one with those initials at that period			1
@entity6 royalty : @entity3 ( right ) , the son of @entity6 actor @entity5 , ( left ) vanished in april 1970 after travelling to the country at the height of the @entity34 war when he was 28 family : @entity5 and @entity3 are pictured together in @entity65 in 1956 when @entity3 was a teenager ' a magnifying glass shows the initials were carved before the scratches appeared , indicating they were done when the camera was new			1
' as one myself , i can state with complete certainty that any photographer putting his camera down with a dozen others in a camera pool would definitely leave his initials on it to avoid any confusion			0
' @entity3 and @entity11 disappeared after they were captured by communist - led guerrillas at a roadblock			1
two hours earlier the young friends had been pictured setting off on motorbikes to investigate reports that a @entity87 patrol was in the area			0
disappearance : @entity3 and cameraman @entity11 ( right ) disappeared after they were apparently captured by communist - led guerrillas at a roadblock the two men ’s failure to return sparked widespread speculation about their fate that persists to this day , whilst their dare - devil approach , dangerous assignments and mysterious disappearance inspired the 2010 film @entity99			2
mr @entity17 believes the riddle over whether the camera did indeed belong to @entity3 could one day be solved			1
' @entity1 could establish from its serial number who originally bought it , ' he said			0
' i ’m sure the guy who put that camera on @entity2 can have had absolutely no idea of its possible history			0
“ if i knew i had @entity3 ’s camera , i definitely would n’t have auctioned it on @entity2 — i ’d have gone straight to @entity112			2
' born in may 1941 , @entity3 was the only child to be born to actor @entity5 and his first wife , @entity32 actress @entity114			0
as a teenager , @entity3 had appeared in an episode of his father 's television show , the @entity115 as well as several films , but grew tired of acting and tried his hand at being a safari guide in @entity123 and a sing , eventually turning to photojournalism			0
he travelled to @entity34 as a freelance photographer in 1966 and soon developed a reputation for being among a group of daredevil photojournalists who were prepared to go into combat in order to get the best pictures , and spent some time embedded with @entity134 units			0
vanished : @entity11 ( left ) and @entity3 ( right ) were captured by communist guerrillas at a roadblock after taking time out to appear in his final film , and a stint covering the @entity141 - @entity140 war in 1967 , @entity3 returned to @entity34 to make a documentary about the conflict			1
in early 1970 he travelled into @entity4 , but on april 6 , while working for @entity144 , he and cameraman @entity11 were captured by communist guerrillas at a roadblock while riding rented motorcycles from @entity147 to a @entity4 war zone			0
they were never seen or heard from again , and their remains have never been found - sparking a number of theories about what may have happened to them			0
the most widely - held theory is that they were held captive for more than a year before being handed over to and killed by rebel soldiers known as the @entity159 in june 1971			0
however , others have speculated that @entity3 survived and may even still be alive			0
@entity114 had spent thousands searching for her missing son , but had him declared dead in 1984			2
she died ten years later			0
in march 2010 a @entity164 team part - funded by @entity3 's half - sister @entity166 believed they had found @entity3 's remains at a grave site in the eastern @entity169 , but dna tests found no match to members of his family			2
@entity3 's life has inspired @entity176 song @entity3 , and the 2011 film @entity99 .			2
