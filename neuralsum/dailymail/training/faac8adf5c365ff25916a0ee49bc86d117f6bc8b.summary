she said : ' we aimed for understated beauty , drawing inspiration from a 1960s coat dress that i bought in @entity110 , among other vintage looks and archive pieces			0
' creating a couture dress and frock coat not only for the occasion of the royal christening , but for @entity16 , who is so naturally elegant and stylish is a commission that every designer dreams of			0
' true blue : both the @entity19 and @entity23 chose shades of blue for the christening in the navy : @entity125 wore a chic navy dress with matching coat - and those trusty nude heels , which have become such a favourite of the royal women the last of the ivory trio , @entity96 , meanwhile , chose a smart coat , matching bag and dramatic feathered hat			1

has the ' illusion ' coat arrived ? @entity154 matchy : the @entity155 , @entity145 of @entity146 and @entity96 watching their husbands as they pass by during the procession of @entity159 , at @entity160 , in june 2012 the perfectly - groomed @entity23 , who smiled broadly as she arrived for intimate ceremony accompanied by husband @entity162 and children @entity70 and @entity164 , teamed her coat with a large cream picture hat			1
and it 's not the first time the merry wives of @entity160 have gone matchy matchy - who could forget @entity96 , @entity14 and @entity155 in co-ordinating cream and blush shades at the historic @entity159 service at @entity160 in june last year ? then , @entity14 dazzled in another @entity51 outfit , with a @entity176 hat @entity96 , 65 , sported an @entity178 cream chiffon dress and pale pink coat with a dramatic @entity181 hat , while the @entity155 , 47 , looked elegant in bespoke @entity183 suit and saucer - shaped hat			1
can we now expect a colour theme for each royal event ? we hope so			0
although cream and blue were the perfect choice for the event , and all of them looked lovely , we think everyone should follow the @entity19 's lead and throw a bit of bright colour in the mix next time .			1
