by @entity0 published : 18:03 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 18:05 est , 10 march 2014 the situation at @entity3 grows yet more toxic with managing director @entity4 severing contact with owners @entity6 but staying at the helm at @entity9			2
troubled @entity3 are in limbo while the @entity11 decide whether prospective buyer @entity12 , who faces a fraud trial in @entity14 next week , passes their owners and directors test			0
so @entity4 ’s acrimonious split with the @entity20 - based , @entity19 - owned @entity6 investment bank , who bought @entity3 from @entity22 in december 2012 , will only add to the confusion around a club beaten 5 - 1 at home by @entity26 on saturday			0
dejected : @entity3 players including @entity28 ( middle ) look glum as they go down 5 - 1 at home to @entity26 on saturday waiting game : @entity14 @entity12 is hoping to get @entity11 approval for a takeover of the @entity35 club @entity4 has told friends he has been left high and dry by the @entity6 hierarchy while he has tried single - handedly to keep @entity3 afloat by finding new loans and investors			2
this includes putting £ 1.5million into the club himself			0
the disintegration in relationships since @entity6 agreed a deal with @entity46 owner @entity12 to take a 75 per cent stake has been quick			0
it was only five weeks ago that @entity4 said : ‘ i am grateful for the full and continuing support of @entity6			0
’ still smiling : @entity3 boss @entity50 has been forced to deal with a number of off - field issues this season @entity53 has revealed how he benefited from working with sports psychologist @entity54 , who is going to @entity55 with the @entity57 squad			1
and it will be a further bonus for manager @entity59 that @entity60 believe @entity54 has contributed significantly to the prime form of @entity53 ’s club and international colleagues @entity64 and @entity65			1

@entity67 ' abrupt departure as @entity69 head of communications can now be explained with his arrival in the same role at @entity74 club @entity73			1
@entity67 , who is understood to have found life difficult at @entity69 and did not enjoy personal attacks against him on @entity77 , forged close links with @entity73 ’s @entity80 owners @entity82 ’s while working for @entity81			1

@entity83 , neck and neck with @entity3 to be the most dysfunctional club in the @entity74 , are understood to have parted company with head of recruitment @entity89 via voicemail			1
@entity89 found out he was leaving after listening to a message left by the financial department			1
as per usual , @entity83 ’s ‘ spokesman ’ did not return calls			2

@entity96 ’s swerved the @entity99 ’s @entity98 training centre that cost £ 100m to build is only being occupied by the @entity57 team for four days during their three - week @entity102 build - up			1
the @entity99 say warm weather training in @entity104 and @entity105 is crucial to @entity59 ’s plans meaning limited time at @entity108 in @entity109 , especially as @entity57 travel to the @entity111 near @entity112 the day before @entity114 games			2
however , sensitivity around @entity108 usage by the @entity57 team can be gauged by the minutes of the last club @entity57 board meeting , which stipulate the senior side will always spend time there in future international weeks			2
staying away : @entity59 's @entity57 squad , pictured here at @entity98 in october last year , will spend only four days at the national training centre in their three - week @entity102 build - up @entity125 and @entity126 , two senior commercial executives who left the @entity99 following re-structuring , have set up their own company @entity127 to work across all commercial sports business			1
their departure comes with the @entity99 still a long way from finding a replacement for @entity132 , whose £ 9m - a - year @entity134 sponsorship ends in may			0
@entity137 , in their wisdom , believe @entity140 commentator @entity139 ’s radio experience will help him call the action for tv and audio audiences after the @entity145 ’s extraordinary ‘ significant savings ’ decision to use the tv feed for their radio coverage on april 5			1
meanwhile , the @entity145 ’s feeble reasoning for interviewing journeymen footballers @entity152 and @entity154 during the @entity57 v @entity155 6 @entity150 game was that they would give a different take as professional sportsmen			2
double use : the @entity137 's @entity139 ( right ) , pictured here interviewing @entity161 @entity160 captain @entity159 , will have his tv commentary of this year 's @entity140 used for radio coverage too @entity134 rules state that opposing teams must wear different coloured shorts , yet @entity167 and @entity168 both wore black for their quarter - final			1
an @entity99 spokesman said the referee raised no objections and there were different coloured flashings on the shorts			0
similar : @entity167 and @entity168 both wore black shorts in their @entity134 quarter - final on sunday , despite @entity99 rules			0
