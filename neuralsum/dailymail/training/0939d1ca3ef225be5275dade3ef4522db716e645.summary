@entity2 ’s @entity1 mission is currently making its way towards a comet in the solar system			1
and , in a series of stunning new images , it reveals how comet @entity9 has begun to develop into an exciting ball of dust and gas			2
over a period of six weeks the comet has begun to extend its dusty veil known as a ‘ coma ’ into space			0
this sequence of images was taken between 27 march and 4 may , as the gap between spacecraft and comet closed from around 3.1 million miles ( five million kilometres ) to 1.2 million miles ( two million kilometres ) the @entity1 spacecraft is set to rendezvous with the comet later this month before entering orbit in august and becoming the first spacecraft ever to orbit a comet			1
@entity1 , named after a block of stone that helped archeologists decipher ancient @entity33 hieroglyphs , will seek to help scientists unlock the composition of comets and thereby understand more about the origins and evolution of our solar system			0
the probe was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five times , picking up energy from @entity45 and @entity46 to line it up with its final destination : @entity49 – @entity50			0
for the coldest , loneliest leg of the mission , as @entity52 travelled out towards the orbit of @entity54 , the spacecraft was put into deep - space hibernation			0
later this year , @entity1 will complete its cruise towards the comet , meeting with it in august , before putting its @entity61 lander onto the comet ’s surface in november			1
once there it will follow the comet on its journey around the sun , performing extensive studies of the coma and the surface			2
and in november it will perform another first when it releases the @entity61 lander , which if successful will be the first vehicle ever to land on a comet			1
by the end of the sequence of images of the comet the coma extends about 800 miles ( 1,300 kilometres )			2
but the core of the comet , known as the nucleus , is itself just 2.5 miles ( four kilometres ) across and can not yet be seen			0
the coma has developed as a result of the comet moving progressively closer to the sun along its 6.5 year orbit			2
even though it is still more than 370 million miles ( 600 million kilometres ) from the sun - more than four times the distance between @entity45 and sun - its surface has already started to warm , causing its ices to turn to gas and escape from its rock - ice nucleus			2
as the gas escapes , it also carries a cloud of tiny dust particles out into space , which slowly expands to create the coma			0
the warming will continue as the comet moves closer to the sun and activity rises , and pressure from the solar wind will eventually cause some of the material to stream out into a long tail			0
@entity52 and the comet will be closest to the sun in august 2015 , between the orbits of @entity45 and @entity46			2
the @entity1 spacecraft launched in 2004 on a mission to study comet @entity9 ( artist 's illustration shown )			1
it will rendezvous with the comet later this month before entering orbit in august , becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a comet in november of this year the @entity61 lander will be sent to touch down on the surface of the comet ( artist 's illustration shown ) , which will be the first landing ever performed on a comet			1
here , harpoons will be fired into the surface to keep it anchored while it studies its surroundings the onset of activity now offers scientists the opportunity to study dust production and structures within the coma before getting much closer			0
' it ’s beginning to look like a real comet , ' says @entity141 , principal investigator for @entity142 , the @entity143 , at the @entity144 , @entity145			0
' it ’s hard to believe that only a few months from now , @entity1 will be deep inside this cloud of dust and en route to the origin of the comet ’s activity			0
' in addition , tracking the periodic changes in brightness reveals the nucleus is rotating every 12.4 hours ' about 20 minutes shorter than previously thought			0
' these early observations are helping us to develop models of the comet that will be essential to help us navigate around it once we get closer , ' says @entity162 , @entity1 spacecraft operations manager			1
on 25 feb 2007 the @entity1 spacecraft returned this stunning image of @entity46 as it flew past the red planet on its way to the comet			1
the picture was taken by an imaging instrument on the @entity61 lander at a distance of 620 miles ( 1,000 kilometres )			1
below the solar array an area close to the @entity174 region is visible on the planet 's disk @entity142 and the spacecraft ’s dedicated navigation cameras have been regularly acquiring images to help determine @entity52 ’s exact trajectory relative to the comet			2
using this information , the spacecraft has already started a series of manoeuvres that will slowly bring it in line with the comet before making it enters orbit in the first week of august			1
detailed scientific observations will then help to find the best location on the comet for the @entity61 lander ’s descent to the surface in november			1
the images shown here were taken during a six - week period that saw the orbiter ’s 11 science experiments and the lander and its 10 instruments switched back on and checked out after more than 2.5 years of hibernation			0
earlier this week , a formal review brought these commissioning activities to a close , giving the official ‘ go ’ for routine science operations			0
' we have a challenging three months ahead of us as we navigate closer to the comet , but after a 10 ' year journey it ’s great to be able to say that our spacecraft is ready to conduct unique science at comet @entity216 , ' says @entity217 , @entity1 ’s @entity1 mission manager .			1

@entity2 's @entity1 spacecraft is getting ready to rendezvous with a comet
and ice from the target has started to create a ' coma ' as it nears the sun
this is seen in a series of images taken by the spacecraft as it approaches
later this month @entity1 will perform its first rendezvous with the comet
it will become the first spacecraft ever to orbit a comet in august
in november the @entity61 lander will be the first vehicle to land on a comet
