by @entity0 a centuries - old ban on marriage between different members of @entity5 's rigid caste system has been overturned by an influential tribal council			1
previously @entity7 in @entity5 , who live according to a complicated system of classification , had to marry according to prohibitive social guidelines			1
but now a council - known as a panchayat - in @entity14 , northwestern @entity5 , has relaxed its marriage policy , allowing 36 different castes in the area to marry freely			1
relaxing the rules : thanks to the changes , many people in @entity14 , northern @entity5 , will be able to marry outside their caste the matches will still have to be approved by the bride and groom 's parents , but has been hailed as a ' positive development ' by campaigners in the region , the @entity23 reported			1
although the move will significantly widen the pool of potential matches , a separate ban on marrying too close to home still stands , banning matches between anyone from the same village or the same ' gotra ' ( an extended family unit similar to a clan )			1
victim : @entity42 , pictured , was murdered after eloping for a forbidden marriage in the past , those who defied the ban have been brutally punished			2
in september a 23 - year - old student and his girlfriend , 20 , were beheaded and beaten to death respectively for having a forbidden relationship			2
last year two parents who poisoned and strangled their 19 - year - old daughter for eloping were caught by police halfway through burning her corpse			2
council leaders have denied ordering ' honour ' killings such as these			2
the leader of the @entity59 khap panchayat , which has relaxed its ban , said that the change was thanks to declining numbers of suitable partners for young people in the area			1
the council is the biggest in the area			0
@entity68 said : ' the number of unmarried youth has increased in past few decades and people were forced to bring brides from outside the state			2
we decided to allow inter-caste marriages , provided both the families agree to the proposal			0
' according to the @entity79 , the new rules will apply to across the area controlled by the panchayat , which covers 42 villages which contain 36 different castes			1
around 60 per cent of the population , which is spread out over 100 square miles , belong to the @entity87 ethnic group who are subject to the marriage rules			0
the @entity59 khap panchayat is not the first council to relax its marriage ban , but is one of the most significant			1
some are hailing the move as the beginning of a much more widespread change in attitudes			0
@entity98 , who founded a group called @entity101 group which helps couples elope to get round the bans , praised the move			0
he said : ' itâ € ™ s a positive development			0
itâ € ™ s a beginning			0
@entity107 was not built in a day			0
a love revolution is fast taking over the country			0

the @entity59 khap panchayat , in @entity14 , northern @entity5 , revised its ban
now people will be able to marry from any of 36 castes in the region
however , it remains forbidden to marry within your village or tribe
