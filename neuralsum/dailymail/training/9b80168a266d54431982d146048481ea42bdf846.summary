the @entity9 brand has over eight years of experience in making must - have jeans including collaborations with high - end fashion names such as @entity14 and @entity15			2
and now the trendy label is launching a capsule collection of the ultimate skinnies : jeans that are designed to make it look like you have been photoshopped			1
the secret is apparently a patented technological fabric that has been designed to resist the dreaded sag that often forms in the derriere region and the brand maintain that their new trousers will give you the perfect silhouette			1
the brand maintain that the specially pioneered fabric and unique stretch does n't sag and that you do n't have to put them in the dryer to get that extra tight effect when you 've just washed them			1
new ethos : the label is shifting their focus from classic denim to ' party dressing ' for autumn / winter 13 and @entity56 is the star of their campaign @entity59 , @entity2 ’s creative director , added : ' we have always looked at new and unusual ways to freshen up our denim offerings			0
' this season we paid a lot of attention to fabric and fabric technology to give the j brand woman the softness she wants but without losing the fit and recovery of the fabric			2
' the jeans , which are usually priced between £ 75 - £ 285 , have also been designed to be comfortable , despite their figure - hugging style			1
shot by @entity76 fashion photographer @entity75 , the new jeans are modelled by @entity56			2
speaking to @entity77 about his work , @entity75 said : ' working with @entity56 on the @entity2 fall campaign was a pure delight , ' she brought a sense of professionalism and her own unique character and beauty to the pictures that expressed the modernity of the clothes perfectly			0
it was a great collaboration			0
' @entity56 's big break into the fashion world came in 2010 , when she was cast in a @entity94 campaign alongside @entity95 and @entity96			0
she has since been a clothes horse for @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			0
