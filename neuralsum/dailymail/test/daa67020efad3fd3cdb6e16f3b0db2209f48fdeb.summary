as the man who brought through the likes of @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 , sir @entity5 knows a thing or two about producing world - class talent			1
and the former @entity9 boss has tipped @entity12 's @entity11 star @entity10 to be the next man to challenge for the title of world 's best player , competing with @entity4 and @entity17			1
but @entity5 says the 23 - year - old , who has been a star since joining @entity12 from @entity19 in his homeland two years ago , is still some way off			2
sir @entity5 has picked @entity10 as the player to reach the level of @entity17 and @entity4 @entity10 is the @entity24 captain and has been in superb form for both club and country this season since joining @entity28 has been behind @entity17 in the pecking order , but he could emerge soon ' you 'll always look at clubs like @entity32 , @entity12 , @entity33 and @entity9 to produce that kind of player you 're talking about , ' he told radio station @entity36 when asked who can rival @entity17 and @entity4			1
' but to be honest i 'm not sure there 's one sticking out at the moment			0
the boy @entity10 gets a lot of publicity about the potential he 's got , but i think that 's still to be seen , still to be fulfilled			2
' certainly , most people i speak to speak highly of the boy			0
when i had @entity47 at @entity9 , he spoke volumes about the boy 's ability			2
' so hopefully he 'll be the next one who 'll produce the type of talent we see in @entity17 and @entity4			0
' @entity5 insisted that there is no standout player capable of rivaling @entity17 or @entity4 at the moment the two stars are undisputedly the top two players in world football , sharing the last seven @entity59 the @entity61 's most successful ever manager also backed @entity33 boss @entity62 , and revealed that the @entity63 reached out to @entity5 's son , @entity64 , when he was sacked by @entity65 in february			1
' @entity62 is a top man , ' said @entity5			1
' i was over at the @entity33 game with @entity68 and he was fantastic			0
' he came up and he knew @entity64 had lost his job at @entity65 and said " why does n't @entity64 come and spend a few days at @entity33 training ? it will do him the world of good "			1
i ca n't say enough about that man			0
he is top drawer - a fantastic human being and a great coach			0
' @entity62 is one of the best coaches i 've ever come across and one of my biggest opponents , so i would n't worry about his future , that 's for sure			0

former @entity9 boss says no - one is close to world 's top two
but sir @entity5 *suggests* @entity10 will be the next to reach that level
@entity5 was also full of *praise* for @entity33 boss @entity62
@entity62 *invited* @entity5 's son @entity64 to @entity33 training early this year
