by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:08 est , 1 december 2013 @entity3 : 17:36 est , 1 december 2013 discovery : @entity6 's could be late - stage type 2 diabetes , scientists have found @entity6 's and diabetes may be the same disease , scientists claim			1
they have uncovered evidence that the debilitating form of dementia may be late stages of type 2 diabetes			0
the discovery would explain why nearly three quarters of patients with this form of diabetes go on to develop @entity6 ’s			0
researchers from @entity23 , @entity24 , believe the excess insulin they produce gets into the brain and disrupts key chemicals			2
eventually masses of amyloid proteins - which poison brain cells - are created because of the excess which leads to @entity6 , they say			1
@entity32 from the @entity23 said : ' people who develop diabetes have to realise this is about more than controlling their weight or diet			0
it ’s also the first step on the road to cognitive decline			0
' at first they wo n’t be able to keep up with their kids playing games , but in 30 years ’ time they may not even recognise them			0
' according to the @entity47 , about 2.5m people have type 2 diabetes , 80 per cent of which were overweight or obese			1
@entity6 's affects 500,000 @entity50			1
the increased risk of @entity6 's for those with @entity53 has been suspected among the scientific community for a while			1
however , as many people with @entity53 are obese and therefore have shorter life - expectancies , little research has been conducted			1
the scientists experimented on rats , feeding them a diet with a high - fat content in the hope the would develop type 2			0
they then tested the animal 's brains and found their memory skills rapidly went down hill as their diabetes progressed			0
epidemic : 80 per cent of people with @entity74 diabetes are overweight or obese , statistics have shown ( library image ) when researchers looks at the rats ' brains areas of amyloid protein could be seen			2
patients with @entity6 's have similar patterns			1
@entity32 , who says he 's cut down on chocolate since conducting the research , believes the clumps develop because , as the body becomes resistant to insulin , it produces more of the hormone			0
excess insulin then travels to the brain where it is supposed to be controlled by an enzyme that breaks down amyloid			2
he explained : ' high levels of insulin swamp this enzyme so that it stops breaking down amyloid			0
' the latter then accumulates until it forms toxic clumps that poison brain cells			1
it ’s the same amyloid build - up to blame in both diseases — @entity105 diabetics really do have low - level @entity6			2

extra insulin produced in people with disease changes brain 's chemistry
excess of hormone creates amyloid proteins - which poison brain cells
2.5m have @entity53 and 80 *%* are overweight . @entity6 's affects 500,000
