by @entity0 published : 14:38 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 14:51 est , 10 october 2013 a casualty consultant who sent a dying woman home from hospital with painkillers had her written apology to the family literally thrown back in her face at an inquest today			1
angry mum @entity10 flung the hand - written apology across the courtroom towards @entity14 consultant , @entity13 , as she gave evidence at the inquest in @entity17			1
mrs @entity10 ’s daughter , @entity18 , 44 , died at home on december 19 from an undiagnosed pulmonary embolism - a blood clot on the lungs			1
she had been rushed into @entity23 two days earlier after becoming dizzy and falling downstairs , banging her head and shoulder , at her home in @entity28 , @entity23			0
@entity10 ( left ) with a picture of her deceased daughter @entity18 and granddaughter @entity30			1
@entity32 ( right ) , the @entity14 consultant who sent dying ms @entity18 home with painkillers the inquest heard that ms @entity18 was breathless , had high blood pressure and heart rate and a low oxygen saturation - all symptoms of a pulmonary embolism			1
but miss @entity13 made no checks for an embolism or dvt and instead concentrated on checking ms @entity18 ’ injuries from the fall			1
after x-rays and an @entity48 showed no fractures or heart problems @entity51 sent ms @entity18 home with painkillers and a muscle relaxant drug , diazepam - even though her blood - oxygen level was still falling			1
miss @entity56 told the inquest she had not considered dvt or an embolism because ms @entity18 did not complain of leg pain or swelling			1
ms @entity18 died of an undiagnosed blood clot on the lungs the doctor agreed with assistant coroner @entity64 that the decision to discharge ms @entity18 was ‘ wrong			1
’ ' she should have kept ms @entity66 in and reviewed her , looking for signs of low oxygen levels , ' she said			0
the doctor said she had ‘ learnt lessons ’ from her mistake and had since received extra training in the recognition and management of blood clots as well as how to cope in a busy department and improve communications			1
the inquest heard that within hours of being discharged from @entity14 that morning ms @entity18 ’ condition was worsening and her worried mum took her to the @entity81			1
there she was seen by locum gp dr @entity83 - who decided her symptoms were due to her known conditions of anxiety and asthma and also sent her home			2
practice nurse @entity90 said when ms @entity18 came in she ‘ looked dreadful , very unwell ’ and distressed and was breathing rapidly , she immediately put her on oxygen while waiting to see the gp , she said			1
' my memory is that she said she felt " like i ’m dying " or something of that nature			0
' dr @entity83 said : ' there was no complaint to point me towards pulmonary embolism			0
she did not complain of pain in the leg or chest pain or coughing up blood all of which were things that would have alerted me to an ambolus			2
' the inquest heard that night that ms @entity18 felt so poorly she did not get up from the sofa and spent all night there			1
in the morning she was still the same and her son @entity110 , 25 , who lived with her helped her to the bathroom and then to bed			0
he said in a statement that she was feeling hot and complaining of breathlessness , he last saw her alive when he went to bed himself between 11.30pm and midnight - and he found her dead in bed the next morning			2
the note sent to the family of @entity18 by @entity14 consultant @entity32 @entity120 dr @entity119 said ms @entity18 died from bilateral pulmonary embolus caused by a blood clot in a vein of the left calf			1
accident consultant dr @entity125 , who led a hospital investigation into the tragedy , said symptoms were ‘ overlooked ’ by @entity51 and a result appropriate treatment was not given			2
she had failed to undertake a thorough and detailed examination considering all symptoms , he said			0
this was partly due , he added , to an increasing workload in @entity14 and also to the absence of a middle grade doctor to assist			1
lack of training of nursing staff also played a part			0
the assistant coroner said she did not find that the failures amounted to a verdict of neglect			1
instead she recorded a narrative verdict saying : ' the deceased had a history of asthma , panic attacks and anxiety			0
' she suffered a dvt causing pulmonary embolus which on the balance of probabilities caused her to fall on 17th december 2012 , causing admission to hospital later that day where the pulmonary embolus went undiagnosed and the deterioration in her condition went unrecognised			2
' ' she later attended her gp who declined to re-refer her to hospital			0
taking the view that her head injury had already been investigated and her breathlessness was due to exacerbation of her asthma and anxiety			0
her condition continued to deteriorate and she passed away on 19th dec 2012			0
' after the hearing mrs @entity10 said : ' i am not happy			1
the verdict should have been neglect			2
my battle starts now because i intend to complain to the doctor ’s professional body to get her struck off			0
' @entity51 is still working in her £ 120,000 a year job or whatever it is but my daughter is dead and i am serving a life sentence			2
' my daughter had a pulmonary embolism in 2009 and was in hospital for several days so it was a known problem she had			2
yet in the inquest the said they could not find any record to show that , which was very convenient for them			0
' i was so angry when the consultant was giving evidence that i threw her card back at her			1
i know i should n’t have done but i was so upset to see her there admitting she made a mistake which cost my daughter her life			2
' ' i assessed miss @entity18 , organised investigations and subsequently decided miss @entity18 did not need admission			1
' i apologise wholeheartedly that i got your daughter ’s diagnosis wrong			2
i have spent the last nine months reviewing with my colleagues in the hospital how i could have made such a mistake			0
' ' i saw miss @entity18 as a trauma patient			1
as we were very busy i focused on rapidly assessing and reviewing patients			0
' i saw your daughter , made decisions about her injuries and was re-assured as her chest x-ray and shoulder x-ray were normal			0
i then discharged your daughter			0
' i clearly should have been looking in depth at what caused your daughter to be unwell and subsequently fallen downstairs			0
' over the last nine months i have reviewed what has happened , had additional training and looked very closely at how i practice especially when the department is busy			0
' i can only say sorry and work harder to improve my clinical practice in the future			0
