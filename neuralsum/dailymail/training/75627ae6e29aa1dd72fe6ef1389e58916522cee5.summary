a quick message from @entity1 before he flew back to @entity2 : i love @entity4 and @entity4 loves me			1
it was late on sunday night and the formula one world champion was clearly in a state of shock after beating @entity8 to the @entity10 award			1
the bookmakers , and most pundits , had not given him a prayer and he had believed them			2
i ’m aware of ups and downs of negativity and positivity within the @entity37 and i ’m sure it ’s not easy for people watching on tv to understand who someone is			2
‘ it ’s not until i meet people that things change			0
’ @entity1 , who lives in tax exile in @entity47 , added : ‘ i did n’t know how popular i was here			1
people realise i do raise the flag proudly			0
‘ i do n’t know how many people called in , but i ’m just overwhelmed			0
’ within minutes of receiving the award amid a standing ovation from guests at the event in @entity26 , the racing driver was being attacked on social media sites such as @entity57 for his status as a tax exile during his speech , @entity1 said his family were his inspiration and paused to hug his brother @entity63 ( right ) @entity1 won 209,920 votes to @entity8 ’s 123,745			1
@entity17 , the @entity65 10,000 metres champion , got 99,913			1
the total cast was 620,932			0
what do the figures tell us ? that the enthusiasm for neither candidate went off the dial			0
last year @entity73 won with 401,470 votes , despite fewer people watching the programme than this year ( 5.6m on average compared with 6m )			2
@entity8 ’s support on sunday would have put him fifth in 2012 , though that was @entity80 year and competition was fierce			1
so why was his vote so low ? several possibilities : golf ’s audience is older and less engaged than @entity86 ’s ; @entity87 did not like him choosing to play for @entity89 in the @entity90 ; the apparently ungallant manner of his break - up from tennis star @entity93 ; and , whisper the heresy , the possibility that @entity86 is more popular than golf ( this was the sixth time a @entity86 driver has won @entity10 against twice by a golfer ) ? @entity8 was disappointed afterwards , but spoke graciously			1
asked about his @entity101 affiliation , he said : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s a question of how @entity4 i feel			0
it ’s a question of how people view me			0
look , it ’s a public vote and just because i declared for one country and not another does n’t make a difference			0
’ earlier in the evening , @entity1 , 29 , was joined on the red carpet by his pet bulldog @entity21 @entity21 certainly looked red carpet - ready , donning a large gold chain for the occasion @entity21 looked at home on the red carpet , although @entity1 's other dog @entity117 was not present @entity1 won his second @entity86 world title last month after edging an often controversial battle with @entity121 team - mate @entity120 when he clinched the crown with victory at @entity124			2

@entity1 voted 2014 @entity10 on sunday night
he beat golfer @entity8 to the post by more than *85,000* votes
long distance runner @entity17 came third with 99,913 votes
