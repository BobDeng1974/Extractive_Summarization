by @entity1 reporter published : 22:24 est , 1 december 2012 updated : 07:48 est , 2 december 2012 @entity3 's shadow looms over a @entity4 in disarray			1
the face of the @entity4 for much of the last year , the failed presidential candidate has been a virtual ghost since his defeat november 6			1
he has quietly weathered the fallout of the campaign from the seclusion of his @entity14 home , emerging only momentarily for a private lunch at the @entity16 with president @entity17 on thursday			0
clash : @entity3 genuinely believed he had the upper hand in the contest against @entity17 visitor : this image shows @entity23 , a focus of satire during the campaign , apparently dropping in on the meeting his loss and immediate withdrawal from politics , while welcomed by most , has created a leadership vacuum within his party			1
pumping gas at his local station in @entity36 , @entity3 was happy to talk about his @entity14 plans it 's left the @entity4 rudderless , lacking an overarching agenda and mired in infighting , with competing visions for the way ahead , during what may be the most important policy debate in a generation			1
in his final meeting with campaign staffers at his @entity49 headquarters , @entity3 promised to remain ‘ a strong voice for the party , ’ according to those in attendance			1
but so far he has offered little to the @entity55 negotiations over potential tax increases and entitlement program changes that could affect virtually every @entity58			2
he declined to comment on the @entity60 's recent refusal to declare @entity61 a currency manipulator , which was one of his signature issues over the past 18 months			0
he made no public remarks after his meeting with @entity17 , quickly fading away , again			0
‘ if i had to tell you somebody who is the leader of the party right now , i could n't , ’ said @entity68 , chairman of the @entity69 , which is among the conservative factions vying for increased influence			0
‘ there 's a void right now			2
’ there 's no shortage of republicans maneuvering to fill it , from @entity16 speaker @entity80 of @entity81 to a number of high - profile politicians looking to boost their national profiles , if not position themselves for a 2016 presidential run			1
that group could include former @entity88 governor @entity87 , son and brother of former @entity92 presidents , and @entity94 governor @entity93			1
the heir : @entity87 attending an event in @entity88 to support former candidates @entity3 and @entity98 the voice : @entity94 governor @entity93 speaking at the @entity100 on september 27 , 2011 @entity4 officials acknowledge party tensions between the moderate and conservative wings , as well as the tea party and evangelical constituencies			1
but they dismiss the leadership vacuum as a standard political reality for the losing party in the presidential race			2
@entity3 , a former @entity110 governor , never had a strong relationship with the conservative base , given his more moderate past			1
party officials are optimistic that a team of younger and more diverse leaders , drawn from the ranks of governors and @entity119 , will emerge in the coming months to help strengthen and unify what is now a party grappling with its identity			2
that list includes @entity88 senator @entity124 , governor @entity125 of @entity126 and governor @entity127 of @entity128			1
the rap fan : @entity88 senator @entity124 speaking at the @entity131 in @entity132 in august 2012 the go - getter : @entity126 governor @entity125 speaking to reporters about the conditions in @entity136 , at the @entity137 in @entity138 in may 2008 the young governor : @entity128 governor @entity127 , 40 , speaking to reporters in the spin room after the @entity143 debate in @entity144 on january 19 , 2012 the @entity4 was in disarray following its 2006 showing , searching for a new path and leader at a time when president @entity150 was deeply unpopular			1
@entity152 senator @entity151 , the 2008 presidential nominee , briefly assumed control of a party that he long had criticized , but it never really warmed to him			0
he lost to @entity17 , and shortly after that , the party turned to an @entity58 official , @entity157 , to serve as its chief spokesman			0
but the decision was widely seen as a mistake , as @entity157 , a former @entity161 lieutenant governor , presided over major financial problems as head of the @entity164			0
all that created a leadership vacuum that helped give rise to the tea party movement in 2009 and sparked rounds of internal battles between party pragmatists and more extreme conservatives			2
@entity4 strategist @entity173 is among those suggesting that the current void presents a breakout opportunity for the party chairman , @entity177			1
the 40 - year - old @entity178 largely played a supporting administrative role in his first two years on the job			0
the fund - raiser : @entity164 chairman @entity177 standing on the floor ahead of the @entity131 at the @entity183 on august 26 , 2012 ‘ to some degree it 's a challenge in as much you do n't have a standard bearer to rally behind that unifies central themes of the conservative movement , ’ @entity173 said			0
‘ the bottom line is that a little bit of messiness and frank family discussion is not a terrible thing after an election like this			0
’ but @entity198 are emboldened , both by their @entity200 successes and the subsequent @entity4 discord			1
@entity4 factions are fighting over multiple issues : the ‘ fiscal cliff , ’ which will dominate the debate on @entity55 at least through the end of the year ; blame for @entity3 's defeat ; and how to appeal to a shifting and more diverse electorate and unify its message			1
the party 's most passionate voters are reluctant to abandon hard - line immigration policies that have dominated their thinking for years			0
but @entity138 - based strategists describe a dire need to win over more @entity218 voters and other minorities who overwhelmingly supported @entity17 in the swing states that decided the election			0
at the same time , rank - and - file @entity4 on @entity55 are struggling to coalesce behind a single message during fiscal cliff negotiations that have exposed a new rift with fiscal conservative guru @entity226 and his anti-tax pledge			2
there 's also evidence that the fight is n't over between the conservative and pragmatic wings of the party in @entity235 primaries			0
conservatives wasted littletime signaling that they would work to defeat @entity237 , a popular congresswoman from a storied @entity239 political family , as she seeks the nomination for the chance to challenge @entity198 senator @entity242 in 2014			1
within an hour of @entity237 's announcing her candidacy , the deep - pocketed conservative @entity243 branded her as the ‘ establishment candidate ’ whose record in @entity119 of supporting prominent bailouts has led to bigger government			0
@entity198 opponent : @entity239 representative @entity237 listening to testimony during a hearing on the @entity252 in @entity138 in may 2012 democrats already are working to exploit the @entity4 divisions to strengthen their own political @entity255 has taken his party 's message directly to voters			1
he visited a @entity262 toy manufacturer on friday , calling for @entity4 to embrace the immediate extension of tax cuts for all but the top 2 per cent of wealthiest @entity92			2
though @entity80 has taken the lead in negotiations with the @entity16 , @entity4 generally did not have a standard - bearer to counter that message			1
instead , they 're relying on familiar @entity55 leaders to guide party doctrine during his debate			0
‘ we do n't have one person out there carrying that torch			0
you 'll have ( @entity128 senator ) @entity276 , @entity80 , ( @entity277 representative ) @entity98 , @entity151 – same old , same old , ’ said @entity4 strategist @entity278 , a senior official on former @entity262 senator @entity280 's unsuccessful presidential bid			1
‘ void of a singular leader , we 're going to have to rely on some of the younger more dynamic speakers to go out and make our argument			0
’ the speaker : @entity286 @entity80 pausing during a news conference in @entity138 on november 30 , 2012 no one , it seems , is talking about @entity3 assuming any sort of leadership role			1
‘ i do n't think that we need to be looking toward @entity3 to articulate our principles , ’ said @entity292 , co-founder and national coordinator for the @entity294			2
it appears @entity3 may cooperate , choosing business over politics in defeat			2
the former businessman is subletting office space at the @entity49 - area venture capital firm , @entity302 , which was founded by his oldest son			0
former aides expect @entity3 to stay out of the spotlight for the foreseeable future – spending colder months at his @entity14 home and warmer months at his @entity309 lake house			1
‘ it might be better for him , better for the party , to start fresh , ’ @entity278 said			0
a happy @entity312 : @entity3 has kept a pretty low public profile since his defeat on nov. 6			2
he is pictured here with his wife , @entity316 , on @entity312			0

with @entity3 out of the picture , conservatives are eying a growing leadership void within the @entity4 as new potential leaders emerge
those leaders include house speaker @entity80 , former @entity88 governor @entity87 and @entity94 governor @entity93 , among others
@entity198 are emboldened , both by their @entity200 successes and the subsequent @entity4 discord
