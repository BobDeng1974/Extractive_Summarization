leading publishers @entity1 are bringing out a book next month by former @entity5 rugby union international @entity3 which many will regard as totally unsuitable for mainstream distribution			1
the book , titled @entity9 , is former hooker @entity3 ’s memories of rugby trips around the world with @entity5 , the @entity12 and club sides			1
it is promoted as ‘ good clean fun ’			0
@entity3 's memories of rugby trips around the world feature in his new book however , the juvenile , obscene contents are anything but — with @entity3 describing in graphic , sordid detail his own and others ’ sexual exploits on tour while he says the first rule of selecting a tour party is : ‘ no c * * * * , however talented			1
’ worst of all , the appendix includes the words of a number of rugby songs — hugely demeaning of women and the disabled — that will certainly offend more than a few readers			1
how @entity1 could print the lyrics of @entity39 and @entity40 , @entity41 and the @entity42 is beyond belief			0
both @entity44 , publicist for the @entity3 book , and @entity47 , the sports editor responsible for commissioning it , refused to comment			2
@entity50 chairman @entity49 and @entity52 president @entity51 both received a £ 16,400 watch @entity50 chairman @entity49 intends to snub a @entity55 edict and not return one of the controversial £ 16,400 watches gifted by the @entity59 football federation to @entity61 delegates before the @entity62			1
@entity55 ’s ethics committee have demanded that the 65 watches , whose value far exceeds the allowed limits , are handed back to @entity68 by october 24			1
but @entity49 announced at the official @entity50 function at @entity70 before the @entity72 game that having paid the £ 3,000 import duty himself , he intended to put the watch up for auction with all the proceeds going to the @entity50 - supported @entity77 charity			1
@entity52 president @entity51 also said he would be keeping his watch to donate to whom he wished			2
but it is now understood he has given it back to @entity55 , leaving @entity49 making a lone protest			1
meanwhile , @entity83 , president of the @entity84 , is not the hardest name to pronounce			0
so it caused plenty of head - shaking at the pre-match function when @entity49 failed to do so twice			2
the @entity50 ’s attempts to make up for the late , great @entity62 - winning captain @entity90 ( right ) never receiving a knighthood now extends to a two - page promotion in the @entity70 programme for @entity5 women ’s game against @entity96 next month , saying the players are following in the footsteps of ‘ sir @entity90 ’			1
@entity100 chief executive @entity99 is just one of many senior personnel leaving sports management giants @entity102 since the company was bought by @entity105 ’s @entity104			2
they include @entity107 , head of football — a sport less central to @entity104 ’s plans than golf and tennis — and @entity114 , who manages relationships with the @entity116 and the @entity117			0
both @entity107 and @entity114 cashed in seven - figure stakes in @entity102 when the takeover took place			0
@entity121 ’s let off the hook @entity121 has had a relatively easy ride from his hand - picked interviewers this week			0
but it is understood @entity127 ’s @entity126 , who asks hard questions , albeit repetitively , on his sportsweek radio programme managed to really rile @entity121			0
@entity121 hand - picked his interviewers for launch of his autobiography meanwhile , the unseemly pr battle between @entity121 and the @entity100 this week is probably a high - scoring draw			0
but the @entity100 could have won easily if they had put up their employees @entity136 and @entity137 for questioning			0
the draw for the first round of the @entity140 will be filmed live by the @entity127 in front of an audience at @entity143 on october 27 , with the event also covered by @entity145			0
however , such focus makes it all the more embarrassing that the @entity50 have yet to secure a £ 9million - a - year sponsor for their flagship competition			1
the @entity50 keep saying they have interested parties			2
but if no deal is clinched soon the heat really will be on the commercial department			0
there is still remarkable interest in the @entity5 team as the 6.6m @entity157 peak viewing figure shows for the @entity72 game , despite it being a waste of everybody ’s time .			2
