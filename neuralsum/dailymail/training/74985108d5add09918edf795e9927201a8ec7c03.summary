by @entity0 published : 17:42 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 18:18 est , 8 july 2013 they seem to come along only once every 77 years , so @entity2 was not going to miss his chance			1
fresh from roaring @entity5 to @entity9 ’s first men ’s @entity7 title since 1936 on sunday , the prime minister yesterday pulled out all the stops to welcome him to @entity11			1
the prime minister could barely contain his glee as the newly crowned champion arrived for a reception			0
mr @entity2 confirmed that the @entity7 champion would be recommended for a knighthood , with @entity5 saying it would be a ‘ nice thing to have ’			1
the prime minister said he would put the ‘ suggestion ’ to the @entity37 , adding : ‘ i ca n’t think of anyone who deserves one more			0
’ mr @entity2 said @entity5 had ‘ lifted the spirits of the whole country ’ with his nerve - racking win over world no 1 @entity45			1
he added : ‘ it was a fantastic day for @entity5 , for @entity9 tennis and for @entity9			1
we were wondering yesterday morning , “ do we dare to dream that this is possible ? ” and he proved absolutely that it was			0
‘ honours are decided independently but , frankly , i ca n’t think of anyone who deserves one more			0
’ @entity5 said he was not sure that he had earned the honour but indicated he would happily accept it			2
asked if he would accept the gong , he said : ‘ i would n’t turn it down			0
’ the 26 - year - old added : ‘ i think it ’s a nice thing to have or be offered			2
‘ i think just because everyone ’s waited for such a long time for this , that ’s probably why it ’ll be suggested , but i do n’t know if it merits that			0
’ @entity5 was awarded an obe in the @entity67 ’s honours list for services to tennis after he won @entity71 gold and triumphed at the @entity72 last october			2

but senior government sources said that was ‘ not a hard and fast rule ’ and the convention will be ignored because of the magnitude of the moment			0
the suggestion that the government will recommend the gong sparked a debate about whether someone who was paid £ 1.6million for his win and is still only 26 should get one of the highest honours			2
ministers appear to be following the example of sir @entity102 who was honoured for winning the @entity103			0

we honoured the @entity146 last year and this goes down as being as significant as @entity148 winning the @entity149 in 1966			2
i hope @entity5 ’s win act as an inspiration for young people			2
his age is nothing to do with it			0
you honour the achievement not the age			0
’ but @entity160 mp @entity159 , who sits on the public administration select committee , which recently conducted an inquiry into honours , said : ‘ it puzzles me why anyone would want the same award as sir @entity167 or sir @entity168			0
