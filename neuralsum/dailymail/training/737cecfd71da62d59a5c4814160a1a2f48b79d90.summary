on their way into the @entity2 , @entity0 got together for one more gig			1
the hedonistic hard rockers , who became the world 's top music act amid endless dysfunction , reunited for three songs on saturday night before 6,000 fans , many of whom were thrilled to see at least most of the band 's original lineup jam on classic hits like ' @entity18 ' and ' @entity19			1
' @entity20 , the band 's frontman and ringmaster of the @entity0 traveling sex , drugs and rock and roll circus , declined to attend the induction , saying he did not want to be part of the ceremony because it ' does n't appear to be somewhere i 'm actually wanted or respected '			1
reunited : @entity0 ' @entity20 , left , @entity32 , top left , @entity34 , top right , and @entity36 , right , perform with guest vocalist @entity37 after induction onto the @entity2 he was hardly missed			1
while his decision disappointed some hardcore fans and ended any possibility of a full - scale reunion of the original lineup , guitarist @entity36 , bassist @entity20 and drummer @entity44 performed for the first time in nearly 20 years to the delight of the sell - out crowd inside historic @entity48			1
@entity0 were one of the headliners of this year 's eclectic group of inductees , which included the @entity53 , the @entity54 , folk icon @entity55 , late singer - songwriter @entity56 and @entity58 bands the @entity59 and @entity60			1
the event lasted well into the early morning with an all - star jam featuring some of rock 's biggest names closing the five - and - a - half hour ceremony with a stirring rendition of @entity69 's ' @entity68 '			1
hours earlier , @entity53 lead singer @entity70 said it was strange to be enshrined while the band was touring			1
' we 're going somewhere , ' @entity70 said			1
' how can we stop and take an award when really we 're just halfway there ? but it is nice to be together with people that we spent some incredible years along the way writing songs and playing shows in little theaters and sweaty little transvestite clubs and having the time of our lives			1
' crowd - pleasers : @entity0 performs in front of 6,000 fans at the @entity2 on saturday , april 14 , 2012 , in @entity88 inducted : drummer @entity34 waves during the band 's performance , left , and @entity20 throws his fist in the air , right happy : @entity0 , from left : @entity32 , @entity20 , @entity36 and @entity34 , after their crowd - pleasing performance @entity88 rocked without @entity20			1
as he inducted @entity0 , @entity98 's @entity97 recalled the first time he saw the band on @entity101			1
' i thought , one these guys could end up dead or in jail , ' he said			1
@entity0 came out both barrels blaring and their debut album ' @entity107 ' , shook a music world that at the time was consumed with pop ballads and dance music			1
' it 's the best debut album in the history of rock and roll , ' @entity97 said			1
' every song hits hard			1
it takes you a trip to the seedy world of @entity118			1
the thing that set them apart from everyone else was guts			1
they never lost their edge for one second			2
' @entity97 talked about each of the @entity0 members , talking about @entity36 's mastery and @entity44 's pulsive , pounding beats before pausing			2
' let 's see , who am i missing ? ' the reference to @entity20 drew boos and catcalls that @entity97 tried to shout down			2
' he 's one of the best frontmen to ever touch a microphone , ' @entity97 said			2
@entity20 and @entity36 did not mention @entity20 during their brief remarks but then took the stage with @entity37 , a member of a side project with @entity36 , singing lead vocals			2
no show : @entity0 ' @entity20 , center and @entity36 , right , perform with guest vocalist @entity37 after @entity4 refused to attend like @entity0 , the @entity53 emerged from @entity118 during the 1980s when @entity146 's rock scene was dominated by ' hair ' bands more concerned with their tight lycra pants and eyeliner than their sound			1
not the @entity53 , who found their unique groove by blending punk , funk , rock and rap			1
while their lineup has undergone some changes - founding guitarist @entity160 died of a heroin overdose in 1988 - @entity162 and bassist flea have survived personal highs and lows and the band remains one of music 's top live acts			2
@entity70 said @entity160 would have loved the honor			2
' i think that he would have a good laugh , ' @entity70 said			2
' yeah , it would certainly mean something to him as he cared deeply about music and the love of the brotherhood of being in a band and being a creative force in the universe , which he is and always will be a brother in everything we do			2
' comedian @entity185 , a longtime fan and friend of the band , inducted the @entity53			1
' if ( @entity191 ) @entity188 ( funkmaster ) @entity189 had a kid he would be ugly , ' @entity185 said			2
' but he would sound like the @entity53			1
' the @entity53 took the stage at 1 a.m. and opened a four - song set with ' by @entity194 ' with drummer @entity195 flanked by @entity196 and @entity197 , two former drummers with the band			1
