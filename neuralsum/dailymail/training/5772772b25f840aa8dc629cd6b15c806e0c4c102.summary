by @entity1 reporter last updated at 6:28 pm on 22nd june 2011 a mother was left stunned when she logged on to @entity3 to find a message from the son she had given up for adoption over 30 years ago			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , was contacted by 36 - year - old @entity9 - who she had not seen since he was six days old - on the social networking site last year			1
the message began ' hi my name is @entity9 and i was born on 22nd june 1975			1
' he then went on to ask her to contact him but added , ' you may not want to reply to this			0
' @entity7 , 54 , who works as a courier for the @entity19 , said : ' it was like a bomb going off , but a nice bomb			1
' reunited : @entity9 , who works as a coach driver , traced his birth mother @entity7 through @entity25 , and then contacted her via @entity3 when she responded she asked him what name she had given him at birth - and knew she had found her son when he replied , ' @entity27 '			1
she discovered that @entity9 - who kept his birth name as a middle name - worked as a coach driver and had enjoyed a happy childhood in the @entity33 after being adopted			1
and the arrival back in her life of her first - born has special resonance for @entity7 , who went on to have two more sons			1
eight years ago her youngest boy , @entity39 , died at the age of just seven after losing a battle with cancer			0
' @entity9 coming back in our lives is like the rounding off of a story , ' @entity7 said			1
' he can never replace @entity39 , of course , but to have him with us is a real happy ending			1
' @entity7 revealed that she had always wanted to trace @entity9 - but he beat her to it , enlisting the help of @entity25 before he finally managed to pinpoint her on @entity3			1
' i always said i 'd never trace him , that it might be too disruptive for him or upsetting , but i often wondered whether he would try to find me , ' @entity7 said			1
' the answer came via that message on @entity3 and it was overwhelming			0
' @entity7 first became pregnant when she was 18 and working away from home in a @entity61 guest house			1
' i was in a relationship that i thought would work out , ' she explained			0
but the couple parted and it was only after the split that @entity7 found herself pregnant			1
aware that the relationship would not last she did not tell her boyfriend about the baby			0
' i was facing being on my own with a child and it was daunting , ' she said			0
' back then , in 1975 , single mothers were viewed very differently to how they are now ; there was a stigma			1
' @entity76 , i just did n't know how i would be able to work and look after a baby , ' @entity7 admitted			2
' i was brought up in @entity8 as an only child in an all - female household with my mum and my great aunt who held a lot of @entity84 views and values			0
" they were also very active in the church and the community			0
there was no way i could go home pregnant			0
' it was daunting to think about keeping the baby but equally daunting thinking about giving him away			0
" she gave birth to her son in a hospital in @entity99 and stayed with him for six days before handing him over to adoption authorities - admitting she did not want him to have the same kind of upbringing as she had experienced			1
' my mother went to work in the former @entity106 , now @entity107 , and met my father who was from the @entity109			2
they later divorced and we lost contact so i never knew him			0
' i did n't want that for my son			2
i wanted him to have a mum and dad			0
i was very upset but i 'd made the decision			0
' @entity7 went on to marry her husband of 33 years @entity120 , who she told about her adopted son - but they faced an uphill struggle to conceive a child of their own			1
together again : @entity9 - who was called @entity27 at birth - has met up with @entity7 and her 18 - year - old son @entity128 ( left ) whom she had with husband @entity120 ' it was especially painful , of course , because of the baby i had given up , ' @entity7 said			1
' i thought about him every day , especially as we were trying so hard to have children.in the end we started to look into adoption			2
" eventually , 14 years after they had married , @entity7 fell pregnant with their oldest son @entity128 , who is now 18 , and had @entity39 three years later			1
but in 2003 their younger son was diagnosed with @entity142 's lymphoma			2
after battling a series of illnesses , including a stroke and septicaemia , he finally succumbed to his illness and he died aged just seven			0
' @entity128 was only a child at the time and i remember him asking : ' ca n't i have another brother ? ' ' by the time he was 15 or so he asked again about whether we might adopt and it was then that i told him he did have another , much older , brother somewhere else but i would never trace him			0
' i did n't even know if he 'd been told he was adopted ; i just felt it might open a can of worms			0
' @entity7 admitted that finding the @entity3 message from @entity9 had left her ' stunned ' - and that she was even more nervous when they finally arranged to meet			1
' it was a strange feeling , ' she said			0
' i was excited but not overly so			0
i wondered whether he would like me , whether he 'd like my husband and son and i worried about the complications it might bring			2
' " i was very nervous but we all just got on like a house on fire			0
and the boys get along wonderfully			0
' ' of course there are times when i wish i could turn the clock back , ' she added			2
' i wish @entity9 could have met my mum and @entity39			2
' but i have a son back			2

@entity7 had not seen son since he was six days old
@entity9 was given up for adoption in 1975
son tracked his mother down via @entity25
' having him back with us is a real happy ending '
