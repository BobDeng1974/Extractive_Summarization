organisers of the @entity1 put out a photograph yesterday purporting to show the ‘ world ’s biggest scrum ’			1
pah ! it looked a tame affair compared to what we had in an @entity10 shopping centre early teatime			1
@entity12 , crrrump , thwock , splatt went a surging , throbbing meteorite of humanity			1
somewhere in its core was @entity18 , leader of the @entity19 , grinning so goofily it looked as if someone had stuck an ironing board in his mouth			1
mr @entity18 sneaked in by a back door			1
cue a stampede of people who had been waiting by the shopping centre ’s main entrance			1
by the time they reached mr @entity18 , he was at @entity41 , where a zoned - out yes voter was shouting through a megaphone ‘ do what @entity18 says – he is your imperial master ’			1
a melee formed and soon acquired an energy field all of its own			2
it contained perhaps 150 steaming bodies , many of them shouting , barging , struggling to keep their balance			1
the group would move 20 yards , then stop , then set off again at an angle			2
the tv cameramen had to walk in reverse			2
at least one toddler ’s pushchair was flattened			2
the scrum contained no - vote supporters , yes - vote protesters , a blinking @entity62 , political aides , and a few shoppers who had only been trying to get to jewellers @entity66			2
a woman entrusted with the task of holding a ‘ no ’ poster just behind @entity18 ’s head was on the short side			1
she kept jumping on her tiptoes			2
limbs flew , leaflets fluttered			2
the background noise was of squawked complaint and minor flesh wounds			2
scrum : mr @entity18 was grinning goofily at the centre of the mob , writes @entity82 while having an elbow jammed up my left nostril and a stranger step on my ankle , i copped a clear view of @entity90 ’s eyes			1
they were two liquorice gobstoppers , rotating slowly in different directions			0
‘ you ’re a f * * * * * * liar , @entity18 ! ’ screamed a yes - vote larrikin			1
‘ call yerself a socialist ? ’ offered another sceptic			0
‘ shame on you , * * * * ! you ’re a scaremonger ! disgrace ! ’ no one could hear what mr @entity18 himself was saying , if anything			1
one of the ladies holding no - vote posters put a hand to her sore ears and sighed ‘ oh , do stop shouting ’			0
whereupon she was informed ‘ you ’re a liar as well ! ’ hounded : most of those around mr @entity18 had their right arms raised , to take snaps with their telephones mr @entity18 is tall			1
each time he set off , his tweezered , hairsprayed coxcomb led the way			0
follow that fringe ! @entity120 lights glowed , flashbulbs pinged , red balloons popped			0
’ @entity122 ! ’ went a child			0
or was it mr @entity18 ’s handsome young gofer @entity125 , whose composure has been unravelling by the day , poor love ? most of the people had their right arms raised , to take snaps with their telephones			1
an evil pong of @entity133 was soon brewing			0
the @entity135 ’ party , always so helpful , turned up			0
the melee nearly drove over a metal bench on which a faintly puzzled old gent was sitting			0
and then , just as quickly as it all started , the mili - maul ended , with our hero vanishing down a car park lift and legging it round the street corner			0
ferocious : @entity145 pictured making one of his booming speeches in @entity148 on tuesday threats : in his speech , mr @entity145 argued that if @entity33 leaves the @entity153 , ‘ inequality will last until @entity152 ’ in other developments , @entity145 made one of his booming speeches in @entity148			0
it took half an hour for my hearing to recover			0
he made a ferocious denunciation of @entity161 ’s ‘ lies ’ on the @entity162 and noted that mr @entity161 ’s main supporters were ‘ @entity165 ’s @entity164 , and @entity166 ’			0
he perhaps meant @entity167 , but heck , this was @entity169 , so @entity164 it duly became mr @entity145 argued that if @entity33 leaves the @entity153 , ‘ inequality will last until @entity172 ’ and the worst - affected will be the poor , for the economy will not prosper with the @entity174			0
he may well be right			0
but @entity19 has cried wolf on poverty for too long			1
it has told the @entity33 they were badly off when , in fact , they were being richly subsidised			0
if working - class voters refuse to believe mr @entity145 , he and his @entity19 mates may have only themselves to blame .			1

@entity18 sneaked into an @entity10 shopping centre by a back door
a mob of roughly 150 people soon surrounded the @entity19 leader
both @entity189 and no voters pushed , shoved and barged through the centre
