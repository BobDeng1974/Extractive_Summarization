she 's the single mother of three who shot to infamy in 2013 when she appeared on the cover of a tabloid to brag about her free boob job under the headline : ' @entity7 '			2
nearly two years on and @entity8 , aka the @entity7 boob job scrounger , has become a media sensation , regularly sparking outrage courtesy of off - colour comments on everything from breast feeding ( incest apparently ) to the identity of her third child 's father			1
but , she says , despite the lurid claims , she is far from being a scrounger and instead , is a loving , hard - working mother			2
' i 'm far from a scrounger , ' she insists			0
' i have worked since i was 16 years old and i 'm self - employed now			2
' ms @entity8 was making the appearance ahead of a new documentary that follows her as she prepares give birth to baby daughter @entity44			1
in it , the @entity46 24 - year - old is seen working with agent and former club promoter @entity49 as they orchestrate one media storm after another - usually via social media			2
but while it might look tawdry , ms @entity8 says her antics are all for a good cause - providing for her three children , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity44			1
' eventually i would like to be in a position where i no longer have to do things in order to stabilise my children 's future , ' she explains in an exclusive interview with @entity65			0
' for now me and my kids are the priority , and that 's all that matters			0
' but making money for those children has seen her lurch from scandal to scandal , all faithfully documented via appearances on breakfast tv and tabloid splashes			0
ms @entity8 first came to prominence in early 2013 , when she sold her first story			1
the tale , about how she , a single mother on benefits , came to be given a free boob job on the @entity7 , sparked instant outrage in a @entity27 just emerging from recession			2
' i phoned up and told [ @entity86 ] that i 've had my boobs done on the @entity7 , ' remembers ms @entity8			1
' i said i want to be a glamour model and [ the boob job ] has changed my life			0
next thing i knew , i was on the front page as @entity94			0
' i 'd been portrayed completely opposite to what i was expecting , which was to encourage other young girls , to tell them that if you 're depressed there 's help there			0
' she followed that appearance with another , this time on @entity104 , which showed off the results of the operation and left little to the imagination			0
working hard : ms @entity8 used the appearance on this morning to tell the world she is not a scrounger misunderstood : she also told hosts @entity111 and @entity113 that people have the wrong idea upset : she said people do n't realise that she is actually a hard - working single mother - of - three not bothered : ms @entity8 , pictured with fiance @entity117 , says she will ' never ' go away help : miss @entity8 's media career has been orchestrated by agent @entity49 ( left ) revelling in the furore , she then made a series of appearances in which she played on her new - found infamy , most notoriously when she stepped out topless with her nipples covered with @entity7 branded tape			1
along with media notoriety , the other result of her going public about her boob job has been a deluge of hate , both online and delivered via @entity130			0
that it continues to this day , says ms @entity8 , is the result of jealousy			1
' i think it was originally about having my boobs on the @entity7 , ' she explains			0
' now i think a lot of people hate the fact i 've managed to gain a lot of media attention - people get jealous of that			2
' she does n't read unpleasant comments , saying that looking at them would ' just annoy me ' but revels in the knowledge that she 's doing nicely , thank you very much , out of the unending bile			2
nevertheless , ms @entity8 does take exception to being described as ' the most hated woman in @entity27 ' and says calling her workshy is wide of the mark as well			1
wide of the mark : miss @entity8 says calling her a scrounger and hated are wide of the mark fixture : miss @entity8 , seen here appearing on this morning , has become a tabloid darling controversial : the 24 - year - old has kept her profile high with a carefully orchestrated media campaign @entity165 plans : ms @entity8 says she wants to feature in every lads ' mag with ' my bangers out ' ' i think i 'm probably up there in the top ten most hated but i do n't think it 's justified , ' she says			1
' i understand why people criticise me as they 've only seen one side to my personality			2
' after the documentary airs tonight , a few more people may warm to me			1
' the documentary , @entity179 : the @entity180 in @entity27 ? , offers a snapshot into a life where domestic chores are juggled with headline - generating antics and where every foray onto @entity187 results in a barrage of hatred			1
in some respects , it 's hard not to sympathise with ms @entity8 , particularly when a man named @entity193 , a 24 - year - old salesman from @entity194 who describes himself as ' @entity179 's biggest hater ' is brought on to comment			1
mr @entity193 , who posts daily expletive - laden videos of himself ranting about ms @entity8 's latest doings , says she has earned every bit of the hate she gets			1
' she is the most hated woman in @entity27 and she proves it day in day out , ' he froths			1
' who would want to watch her give birth apart from her mother and one of the 55 potential dads ? ' she thrives off the hate			0
she just thrives off it			0
she 's not bothered , she does n't care			0
because while we 're all saying [ rude things ] , she 's making piles of money			0
' @entity193 is certainly right about the latter			0
' they think i 'm sitting at home and crying but i 'm not , ' snaps ms @entity8			1
' you can all hate me until the day i die			0
for as long as i 'm making a stable lifestyle and career out of this industry , i am not going nowhere			0
' but while she might be making a decent living out of her notoriety , ms @entity8 says she does have one ambition left for her to achieve			1
' where i want to end up is in every lads ' mag with my bangers out , ' she says , laughing			1
' that can sound as trashy as it it wants but if you had no legs you would want to be @entity230			2
' i 've had no tits for 23 years and i want to be the next big glamour model			0

ms @entity8 says she is not the most hated woman in @entity27
admits that she might be ' in the top 10 ' but says others are worse
says her ambition is to appear in every lads ' mag with ' my bangers out '
compares herself to *disabled* people who want to be like @entity230
thinks that much of the hateful comments she *attracts* are *due* to jealousy
