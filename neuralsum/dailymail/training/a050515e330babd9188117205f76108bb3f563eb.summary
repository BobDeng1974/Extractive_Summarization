the @entity250 exercises , which include local troops , units from other @entity250 members and the @entity264 have inflamed tensions with @entity28 and come amid mounting fears that @entity1 will explode into full - scale civil war a parachute jump in action during ' @entity266 ' , a @entity250 exercise in @entity242 which includes @entity264 airborne troops president @entity279 's order to withdraw @entity78 forces massed along the border with @entity1 was today being carried out , according to the @entity78 defence ministry			1

he said the pullout will be clearly visible in satellite images			0
the announcement went further than an earlier step by the @entity78 leader two weeks ago , when he said the troops retreated from the border to shooting ranges			2
@entity279 's pullout order and his remarks welcoming @entity1 's presidential election this sunday seemed to reflect an attempt to ease tensions with the @entity330 over @entity1 and avoid a new round of @entity330 sanctions			2
he has ignored the plea of some of the rebels in eastern @entity1 to join @entity78 after independence referendums dismissed as a sham by @entity115 and the @entity330			2
