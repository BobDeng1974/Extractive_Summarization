by @entity1 reporter published : 20:29 est , 24 november 2013 updated : 20:31 est , 24 november 2013 the average family manages just 36 minutes of quality time together a day , new research has revealed			1
a study found that hectic work schedules and the sheer volume of domestic chores leave little time for family fun			1
researchers also found that a typical family will find time for just 15 days out together every year			1
it also emerged nearly half of the 2,000 adults polled feel the balance of work and play is skewed in favour of their job			1
time : the average family spends just over half an hour of quality time together per day because of work and other life commitments , research has shown ( library image ) @entity28 , the occasional sunday together and days spent in the garden during the summer were hailed as times when families get to spend quality time together			1
visiting the grandparents and reading to the children at night also gave everyone a chance to relax and enjoy each other ’s company			0
@entity39 , a spokesperson for @entity40 which commissioned the study , said : ' family life gets more hectic as time goes on , so it ’s not surprising that @entity28 is when we spend the most time together in one go			1
' modern family life is hectic for many parents			2
daily chores and housework are an essential part of family life but can also make home life feel very routine			2
' we want to help parents to make the most of this time and see it as an opportunity for interaction and engagement with their kids , not something that gets in the way			0
' the study found working long or anti-social hours was the most common stumbling block , while evenings and weekends dominated by household chores and frantic routines were common			0
that leads to just over half an hour a day that families get to be with one another without regular distraction			0
all together : @entity28 and sundays are when busy working families spend time together ( library image ) but even then it ’s not easy - eight in ten parents admit they often battle with the tv or videogames to get the kids ’ attention			1
despite the majority of families having good intentions to organise things for the family to do as a whole at weekends , plans fall through a quarter of the time due to things getting in the way , results showed			2
no surprise then that 55 per cent of families say they suffer from a hectic domestic life			0
and modern life does seem to take its toll - more than 70 per cent admitted there are regular instances when the whole family sits in front of the television in silence because they ’re too tired for conversation			0
nearly three quarters of mums and dads felt their children were growing up too fast , yet six in ten said their weekly routine does n’t leave them enough time to enjoy their kids at the age they are			0
in fact , nearly a third have missed key moments in their child ’s development because of their hectic routine keeping them away .			0
