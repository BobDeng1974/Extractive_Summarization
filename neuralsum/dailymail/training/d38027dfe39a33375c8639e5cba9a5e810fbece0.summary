@entity0 has branded @entity1 narcissistic , over-sensitive and sheltered in a damning 2,000 - word analysis of ' @entity3 '			1
the writer who notably penned @entity5 sparked a social media outburst when he coined the phrase @entity3 to refer to those born after 1989			1
now he has written an essay to defend his description , adding that he feels sorry for young people today			2
damning : @entity0 , 50 , has written a 2,000 - word analysis of ' over-sensitive ' young people today in the @entity15 article , he writes : ' when millennials are criticized ... they seem to collapse into a shame spiral and the person criticizing them is automatically labeled a hater , a contrarian , a troll			1
' he adds : ' my huge generalities touch on their over-sensitivity , their insistence that they are right despite the overwhelming proof that suggests they are not			0
' the 50 - year - old also lays into news site @entity30 , which announced it will no longer publish any negative reviews			1
' if this keeps spreading , ' @entity0 writes , ' then what ’s going to happen to culture ? ' @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 are also condemned as factors that have fuelled the generation 's sensitivity			2
' if there does n’t seem to be an economic way of elevating yourself , ' he writes , ' then the currency of popularity is just the norm now and so this is why you want to have thousands and thousands of people liking you on @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 ( sic ) — and you try desperately to be liked			0
' the only way to elevate yourself in society is through your brand , your profile , your social media presence			0
' but @entity0 insists he is in fact sympathetic to members of @entity3 growing up in the wake of 9/11 , two brutal wars , and an economic crisis - in a ' demeaning sexual atmosphere that places a relentless emphasis on good looks ( @entity63 being the most prevalent example ) '			1
generation wuss : he says twenty - somethings like those depicted in @entity68 show girls can not take criticism he adds that he has lived with a @entity71 and understands that many of the struggles they are ' over-sensitive ' about are very real - and the @entity68 series @entity75 strikes the balance between critique and sympathy			2
but he says he finds it difficult to maintain sympathy for twenty - somethings ' because @entity1 ca n’t deal with that kind of cold - eye reality '			0
he added : ' this is why @entity3 only asks right now : please , please , please , only give positive feedback please			2
' the author lays the blame on the generation 's parents who grew up in a cynical age - yet when it came to building their own families they tried to shroud their children from the harsh realities of life			1
he warns young people : ' people wo n’t like you , that person may not love you back , kids are really cruel , work sucks , it ’s hard to be good at something , life is made up of failure and disappointment , you ’re not talented , people suffer , people grow old , people die			1
' his words come after three years of tweeting , in which the author and screenplay - writer regularly mocked young people for being too sensitive			1
one tweet read : ' @entity118 comment : " you know , @entity36 has really ruined you for me			0
get a f * * * * * * life '			0
and after a former fan tweeted , ' i just ca n't follow @entity0 anymore			0
