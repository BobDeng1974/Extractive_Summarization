the age of austerity is not just a passing phase and @entity4 should get used to having a ‘ permanently ’ smaller state , @entity0 said last night			2
the prime minister used one of his most significant speeches of the year to say that low public spending and a ‘ leaner , more efficient state ’ would have to be maintained permanently in order for the @entity4 to succeed			1
he said the country would have to rediscover its traditional ‘ buccaneering ’ spirit for private enterprise in order to generate wealth instead of relying on the state			0
pro austerity : prime minister @entity0 made his comments at the annual lord mayor 's @entity22 in @entity24 alongside other ministers and lords keynote speech : the dinner is a chance for the prime minister to make a major announcement			1
he said the country has to rediscover its ' buccaneering spirit ' his remarks are a significant shift for a leader who said in 2010 that he ‘ did n’t come into politics to make cuts ’ , insisting : ‘ we ’re tackling the deficit because we have to – not out of some ideological zeal			1
' in his annual address to the lord mayor ’s banquet at @entity24 ’s @entity44 , mr @entity0 said only a smaller state and a ‘ bigger and more prosperous private sector ’ could heal the economy			1
he called for a ‘ fundamental culture change in our country ’ to champion ‘ that typically @entity4 , entrepreneurial , buccaneering spirit , and that rewards people with the ambition to make things , sell things and create jobs for others up and down the country ’			1
address : mr @entity0 was sat with the past and present lord mayors and spoke to a room of dignitaries , including the archbishop of @entity64 applause : the room welcomes the head table before sitting down to dinner			0
later @entity0 would extoll the virtues of tightening belts impassioned speech : @entity0 warned against an @entity72 - led government that would set the budget deficit and debts ' out of control again ' mention : @entity0 said to archbishop of canterbury @entity77 : ' i hope you will forgive me for saying it 's not robbing but to pay @entity82 , rather robbing @entity83 to pay @entity83 ' incoming : lord mayor @entity84 is the 686th to take office			1
she spoke at the banquet , days after the inauguration parade in an attempt to counter @entity92 ’s pledge to freeze energy bills , mr @entity0 insisted the single biggest threat to the cost of living is the budget deficit and debts getting ‘ out of control again ’ under a government led by @entity72			1
‘ there are some people who seem to think that the way you reduce the cost of living in this country is for the state to spend more and more taxpayers ’ money , ’ mr @entity0 said			0
‘ it ’s as if somehow you measure the compassion of the government by the amount of other people ’s money it can spend			2
at a time when family budgets are tight , it is really worth remembering that this spending comes out of the pockets of the same taxpayers whose living standards we want to see improve			0
’ opulent : around 900 guests attend the event hosted in the hall 's grandest room , which has hosted royalty numerous times since 1411 ' more with less ' : the speech was a shift from @entity0 's claim in 2010 that he ' did n't come into politics to make cuts ' inauguration : lady judge lord mayor alderman @entity84 with prime minister @entity0 exchanging words after his speech promoting welfare cuts toast : home secretary @entity144 drinks a toast to @entity0 's speech , dressed up in a tight , strapless dress and glittery eye make up , seated on the head table in agreement : may smiled and nodded throughout @entity0 's speech sitting along from him on the top table the top table : ( from left to right ) sheriff alderman sir @entity155 ; lady judge ; lord mayor of london @entity84 ; prime minister @entity0 ; @entity158 , the lord mayor 's husband ; @entity160 ; sheriff @entity161 in a reference to the leader of the @entity164 , who has protested about some of the government ’s welfare cuts , mr @entity0 added : ‘ i hope the archbishop of @entity64 will forgive me for saying – it ’s not robbing @entity83 to pay @entity82 , but rather robbing @entity83 to pay @entity83			1
’ he said that if interest and mortgage rates started to soar because the deficit was allowed to rise again , an ‘ increase in cost of living will far outweigh the impact of any increase in government spending or indeed reduction in taxation ’			1
‘ this government is not prepared to let that happen			2
already we have cut the deficit by a third and we are sticking to the task			2
but that does n’t just mean making difficult decisions on public spending			0
procession : @entity0 walks through the @entity44 with lord mayor of london @entity84 and @entity158 , the lord mayor 's husband , before the banquet sea of red : dignitaries wait in the @entity44 before the arrival of the @entity196 ahead of @entity197 on november 11 , 2013 ‘ it also means something more profound			1
it means building a leaner , more efficient state			0
we need to do more with less			0
not just now , but permanently			0
’ mr @entity0 said there was growing evidence that public services could be maintained or improved as budgets are reduced			0
‘ there are 40 per cent fewer people working in the @entity207 - but over 3,000 more free schools and academies , with more children doing tougher subjects than ever before , ’ he added			2
‘ there are 23,000 fewer administrative roles in the @entity214 – but 5,000 more doctors , with shorter waiting times			0
’ he claimed the reductions were proof that a leaner state could deliver better results .			0

the prime minister urged against welfare cuts in speech at @entity197 in @entity24 's @entity44

he warned against an @entity72 - led government which would push the budget deficit and debts ' out of control '
