by @entity0 published : 07:17 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 10:52 est , 7 november 2013 an elaborate planning application for a £ 5.5m seven - bedroom mansion is expected to be given the go - ahead by council officials , even though the owners spend most of their time abroad			0
the plans for the ' @entity8 ' underneath the property in @entity10 include a gym , home cinema , games room and sauna , as well as an adjoining glass tunnel which will lead to a swimming pool pavilion at the bottom of the garden			1
the controversial application has been ' highly recommended ' by planning officials at @entity21 , despite the fact the owners only spend part of the year in the house , splitting their time between the @entity25 and @entity26			1
aerial view : the ' @entity8 ' would extend into the garden of the @entity10 mansion ( highlighted in red ) luxury : plans for the house in @entity34 include the construction of a gym , cinema and sauna a residents association in @entity10 have condemned the plans fearing the construction would cause constant noise and could encourage others in the area to take on similar projects			1
the @entity47 said with basement conversions becoming increasingly popular , giving rise to so - called ' @entity50 ' , the borough council must be vigilant and ensure there is ' robust supervision ' of all the submitted applications			2
@entity54 , chairwoman of the association , said : ' this has been happening in @entity57 and @entity58 for some time now			2
there are now limits to how deep you can build			0
' it is just that suburban authorities have not seen it so much			0
' we do n't object to the principle of the basement under the garden , but if this is allowed without adequate supervision it will set a precedent to others			0
' most of these houses are more than 100 years old and construction could impact on neighbours ' houses			0
' there are conditions in the application which normally have to be met for permission to go ahead , but no recommendations have been made			0
' for example , the document says permission will be granted if noise from the ventilation is kept to a minimum , but it does not say how it can be done			0
' the system should not work like that			0
plans : the tunnel , drawn at the bottom of the sketch , would be 88ft long and would require the whole rear garden of the property to be excavated the owners of the property are attempting to excavate almost their entire garden and build an enormous extension underneath			1
they were granted planning permission to build a swimming pool in february 2012 , but have now upgraded their plans to include the enormous underground structure			1
even though they currently spend part of their lives abroad , they are expected to move back into the property permanently when the building work is finished			0
the glass - covered link between the existing house and the pool pavilion would be 88ft long and 11ft wide			1
a path leading from the house to the pool pavilion would be constructed above the underground tunnel and grass would be re-seeded on the surface			1
the proposals are set to be accepted despite planning permission being refused for a similar swimming pool pavilion to be built in february 2011			1
the plans were rejected on the grounds the structure would be ' detrimental to the character and appearance of the locally listed building and that the pool building was of excessive height			1
' the application concluded by saying : ' the proposed pool pavilion and associated basement link and provision of a basement beneath the existing house is considered to be acceptable in design terms and the proposal would preserve the character and appearance			2
' @entity21 were approached for comment but said they would not comment before the decision is made			2
@entity58 owner @entity141 was famously granted permission to link three adjoining grade ii - listed buildings in @entity145 , @entity58 , through a vast network of underground tunnels at a cost of £ 10m .			0

basement conversion would also have a home cinema and sauna
' @entity8 ' would include a glass tunnel leading to the *indoor* pool
residents association fears there would be constant noise disturbances
plans for a similar project were refused by @entity21 in 2011
