the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) @entity14 touched down in @entity4 when the lithium ion battery sparked an on - board fire , prompting the worldwide grounding of the @entity9 jets due to safety concerns			1
@entity10 's @entity20 has said the battery for the aircraft 's auxiliary power unit was improperly connected to the main battery , which overheated during the flight			1
the board 's report said a protective valve would have prevented power from the auxiliary unit from causing damage , the @entity25 said			1
the fact that lights on the aircraft 's tail and wings were flickering after the emergency landing , and that the main battery was switched off , led investigators to conclude there was an abnormal current travelling from the auxiliary power unit			1
