just 13 and in the grip of a terrifying obsession surviving on just one piece of fruit a day , anorexic schoolgirl @entity1 's body started to shut down			1
the 15 - year - old , from @entity7 , was left on a heart machine after she collapsed through starvation but has now spoken about pressures put on teenagers to be a ' size zero '			1
@entity1 became so obsessed with having the perfect figure she would hide food down the side of her bed , lying to her mother about eating and sometimes surviving on just a piece of fruit a day			1
@entity1 has spoken about her two - year fight with anorexia and revealed the pressures she felt to be thin			1
she said : ' at the worst point i was hiding food down the sides of the settee or beds , lying to my mum about having meals , and eating about 100 calories a day			2
' i would even try to have mashed potato with each meal so i could hide the rest of the food under it , that way it looked like i 'd ate more			0
' after spending a week on a heart monitor at @entity51 , @entity1 was finally offered support from eating disorder organisations as she began her recovery			1
problems started for the teen two years ago when she decided she wanted to go on a diet			2
' i was nearly 13 stone and felt like i was too big , ' @entity1 said			1
' i 'd been bullied a little bit because of my weight , people saying things like ' here comes the whale ' and that made me feel horrible			0
@entity1 was living off just one piece of fruit a day and would hide her food down the side of her bed so her parents would n't see it @entity1 continued : ' i would look around at the other girls and they all seemed to be skinny and , of course , i wanted to be like them and fit into all the different types of clothes			1
' but it was n't just people i knew			0
i felt there was a lot of pressures from all over the place			2
everywhere you looked there seemed to be this idea that girls should be a size zero			1
' @entity1 agreed with mum @entity87 , 48 , to go on a ' sensible diet ' but soon the @entity90 pupil became frustrated , wanting to lose more weight , quicker			1
according to the @entity95 or @entity94 , to give its full name , is a serious mental health condition in which people try to keep their body weight as low as possible			0
it is often said that people will often restrict their intake of food , make themselves vomit or increase the amount of exercise they are doing			0
the condition often develops in people who are anxious about their body shape or weight , or in those who fear being fat or wish to be thin			0
@entity95 most commonly occurs in women , starting around the age of 16 or 17			0
although there are cases of men suffering from the disease too			0
often people suffering from anorexia will obsessively count calories , take laxatives and repeatedly weight themselves or check their bodies in the mirror			2
if you think you know someone who is suffering from the disease talk to them gently about it			0
often it can be hard for them to seek help			0
you can also seek advice from an eating disorder charity such as @entity133 , who will be able to talk you through how to help them and how to handle the situation			2
in february 2015 it was estimated that around 725,000 people were suffering from an eating disorder in the @entity141 - 10 per cent of those were suffering from anorexia			1
' it was coming off quite slowly , at about 2lbs a week , ' said @entity1			1
' but i became much more obsessive about it and decided to reduce my calorie intake			0
' in the end , i was virtually eating nothing , maybe an apple or orange a day			2
' i could tell my parents were getting worried , they could n't understand why i did n't want to eat			0
' lack of food soon took its toll on @entity1 's health and her heart rate started slowing			1
she said : ' i was in bed for three or four days , never going out of the house			0
' i would feel dizzy or pass out because my heart rate was so slow			0
' finally after a week of eating virtually nothing , @entity1 collapsed			1
no happy and healthy @entity1 has made it to the semi final of @entity164 , the competition aims to stay away from size zero stereotypes @entity87 , who works in sales , said : ' an ambulance was called and she was taken to hospital and put on the heart monitor for a week			1
her body had just started to shut down			0
' it was frightening , i was shocked that this was happening to my daughter			0
' i remember sitting by her hospital bed and saying " @entity1 , do you realise how sick you are ? " but she just said " i do n't care , as long as i 'm skinny "			2
' it was then i realised just how much pressure she , and all girls , were under to look a certain way			2
' after getting discharged @entity1 began working with eating disorder teams ( @entity183 ) and @entity184 ( @entity184 ) to help in her recovery			1
today , her body image is better than ever and her new - found confidence has allowed her to make it through to the semi final of miss @entity190 the contest aims to promote ' positive and confidence - building experiences ' for young girls , away from size zero stereotypes .			1
