but this sea lion now has a stunt of his own			0
with unwavering balance and effortless cool , he surfed a crashing wave into the beach of @entity18 - astounding onlookers			1
performing : part of a troupe of 20 , small groups took it in turns to carve the ocean , impressing onlookers there was no need for a surf board as the pup assumed an elegant pose - with flippers in and head to the sky - and soared towards the @entity33 shore			1
people leaped for their cameras to capture the unconventional beach boy - who was followed by his troupe of 20			1
they judged it perfectly - as the summer drew to a close and windy weather started picking up , the waves were at their prime			2
after waiting for a huge swell , the playful mammal rushed to catch the curling water			0
off and away , he rode it for 50 to 100 metres before disappearing beneath the foam			0
the clan of surfers have become obsessed with their new talent since they first discovered it last month			0
instead of splashing around the water , they follow a strict routine of daily ' runs ' that last for 30 minutes			1
full time photographer and trained behavioural ecologist , @entity57 , managed to capture the rare moment on camera on 22 august			1
@entity57 said : ' the sea lion was definitely surfing , every sea lion that caught a wave coming at our direction stared at us for their entire ride and never broke eye contact			2
surfer lion : after waiting for a huge swell , he rushed to catch the curling water , riding it for 50 to 100 metres ' we watched the sea lions taking surfing runs for at least 30 minutes on this occasion , and the same the following day when we returned			1
' the sea lions were being extremely selective of which waves they chose to work with , we even observed some waves with two lions surfing side - by - side , a few with three sea lions surfing and even one wave with four sea lions coming down together			2
' when a sea lion completed its own run , it would instantly turn around and swim back and do it again and again , and again			0
' it was really hard to watch these frolicking sea lions and not think they were surfing for any reason other than having old fashioned fun ! '			0
