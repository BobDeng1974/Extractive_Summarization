by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:25 pm on 20th january 2012 more cracks have been discovered in the wings of the world 's biggest passenger jetliner but @entity6 has insisted the aircraft are still safe to fly			2
the damage has been found in two more @entity10 superjumbos , just two weeks after tiny cracks were first reported in the wings of the 525 - seat , double - decker aircraft , which entered service just over four years ago			1
the initial discovery led to @entity17 @entity16 last week called for the aircraft to be grounded amidst safety concerns			2
safety concerns : more cracks have been discovered in the wings of the world 's biggest jetliner , the 525 - seat , double - decker @entity10 superjumbo , but @entity6 has insisted the aircraft are still safe to fly ' @entity6 confirms that some additional cracks have been found on a limited number of non-critical brackets ... inside the wings of some @entity32 , ' the planemaker said in a statement			1
' @entity6 emphasizes that these cracks do not affect the safe operation of the aircraft			0
' the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) confirmed it would issue a bulletin friday mandating precautionary checks			0
the latest cracking problem was discovered in two aircraft during a routine two - year inspection , an @entity6 spokeswoman said			1
@entity44 subsidiary @entity6 has so far delivered 68 superjumbos , starting with @entity46 which took the first aircraft in december 2007 , followed by @entity49 's @entity48 and @entity50 of @entity17			0
other operators include @entity52 , @entity54 's @entity53 , @entity55 and @entity56			0
reassurance : @entity6 has emphasized that these cracks do not affect the safe operation of the aircraft so big that many airports had to modify their facilities to accomodate it , the @entity10 was designed to challenge @entity65 's monopoly of the large passenger aircraft market			1
the aircraft 's upper deck extends along the entire length of the fuselage , allowing for a cabin space of 5,145 sq ft - some 49 per cent more than @entity65 's 747 , the next largest passenger jet currently in service			0
the @entity10 is designed for a range of up to 9,600 miles ( 15,400km ) , enough to fly from @entity75 to @entity76 , at a cruising speed of @entity78 ( 560mph or 900km/h )			1
however , since the first deliveries of the aircraft in 2007 , the planes have already been plagued with a series of problems			0
a blowout in the superjumbos ' @entity87 - built @entity86 900 engines led to an emergency landing of a @entity10 in november 2010			1
@entity50 grounded its @entity6 fleet for more than a fortnight after the midair explosion over @entity93 , which was found to have been caused by a faulty pipe			2
rolls subsequently admitted dealing with the fault , including replacing the engines on several aircraft , had cost it Â£ 56million			0
even the @entity10 's massive size has posed difficulties			1
last june an @entity102 lost its wing - tip in a taxiing collision with a building at @entity107 airport @entity106			0
the collision mirrored an incident at @entity109 earlier that year when a private jet was spun round after it was hit by the wing of an @entity10			1
the latest problems were discovered in the same type of part as the earlier set of cracks , an l - shaped bracket which connects the wing 's exterior to the internal ' rib ' structure			2
@entity10 wings are manufactured in @entity122 , north @entity123 , and @entity124 , near @entity125 , before they are shipped to @entity6 headquarters in @entity127 , @entity128 , for final assembly			1
each aircraft is powered by four @entity86 900 engines , built in @entity87			2
in total , some 20,000 @entity134 workers ' jobs rely on the construction of the mammoth planes			0
industry journal @entity138 said the brackets , known as rib feet , had been stressed during the manufacturing process and that this was being fixed			0
the @entity10 has enough room on its wings to park 70 cars and a wingspan of 79.8m ( 261ft 10in ) .			1

wings are built in @entity122 , @entity150 , and @entity124 , near @entity125
latest problem to hit the @entity10 since engine blowouts grounded them in 2010
