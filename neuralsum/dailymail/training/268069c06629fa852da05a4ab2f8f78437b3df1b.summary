she regularly dresses up their two poodles , @entity41 and @entity27 , because she says they love the attention			2
however , not all the attention they receive is positive			0

@entity57 : @entity25 shows off another of her dogs , @entity41 , who wears ostrich feather hair extensions ' furjazzling ' , left , involves putting stickers on the dog 's fur while @entity41 has also had her nails painted - but @entity25 only uses non-toxic products happy hound : @entity25 said her dogs love the attention they get being groomed she said : ' colouring on a dog is like tinted conditioner			1
it 's aloe vera based so it 's just like putting a deep treatment on the dog , only with colour			2

for many , the costs continue after their beloved pet passes away			0
a new poll has found half of animal owners have held a funeral for their deceased pets , with one tenth of these arranging a formal ceremony to say their final farewells - at an average cost of £ 105			2
the study , conducted by @entity151 , polled 1,608 @entity153 adults , all of whom were aged 18 or over and had owned a pet which had passed away within the past year			0
the poll revealed that dogs were mostly likely to have a funeral held for them after their passing , followed by cats and , in third , rabbits			0
@entity164 of @entity165 said : ' there are those who may find these costs extraordinary , but to many people the loss of a pet can be just as distressing as losing a family member			0
