nowhere in @entity0 signifies the rise of the far - right more than @entity2 in the economically - depressed east of the country			1
dotted around the tiny village , which sits in the northeastern state of @entity7 on the coast of the @entity9 , are murals depicting @entity12 families emblazoned with the words ' @entity13 , @entity15 , @entity16 ' , while targets showing charging soldiers are riddled with bullet holes			0
the vast majority of residents are @entity22 - and proud of it			0
there have been reports of pro-hitler parties here during the summer where attendees chant ' @entity29 ' around a bonfire			0
' their aim ? a nationalist upbringing outside the mainstream , ' said @entity0 magazine @entity34 in a report on the rising tide of @entity22			2
a plaque attached to the boulder at the entrance to the village reads ' village of @entity2 - free , social , national '			1
according to media reports the hamlet of @entity2 has been nearly entirely settled by neo-nazis chilling : a human - shaped target , riddled with holes , rests against a tree in @entity2 @entity2 is close to the hq of the @entity0 @entity50 ( @entity50 ) , a far - right organisation which won six per cent of votes in local elections and has five mps in the regional parliament			1
the party says it rejects violence , but two years ago @entity57 , one of the men who first encouraged neo-nazis to move to @entity2 and an elected representative of the @entity50 , was jailed for four years for possession of a machine gun and a handgun			1
@entity65 , a regional mp for the @entity50 , told the @entity66 : ' many people want a different kind of politics			0
a politics which is social , family - friendly			0
' many of the occupants have their own views , and do n't want to pretend what views they have			0

extremist : a sign of the far - right @entity50 reading ' we keep our word ' is fixed to the side of a container hound : a guard dog stands behind a fence in @entity2			2
the residents use rottweilers to warn off outsiders the village is a troubling reminder for a country currently bracing itself for the shocking trial of a neo-nazi accused of helping to murder eight men of @entity99 extraction			1
@entity100 , 38 , from @entity101 in east @entity0 , has been implicated in the shootings carried out by the @entity103 , a neo-nazi cell			1
she is charged with complicity in the shooting of the eight men , as well as a @entity107 and a @entity0 policewoman , in towns across @entity0 between 2000 and 2007 , as well as two bombings in immigrant areas of @entity112 and 15 bank robberies			1
the case is expected to expose grievous police and intelligence failings in allowing the @entity103 cell – comprising @entity100 and her two lovers – to allegedly operate for so long , especially as they were under covert surveillance for much of the time that the murders were under way			0
the offices of the @entity50 party in @entity125			0
far - right extremist @entity57 has his offices there and lives in @entity2			2
the writing in red states : ' better dead than slaves ' there is a feeling in @entity0 that the authorities did not take the murders seriously because the victims were foreigners and that the country has been ‘ blinded ’ to the threat of violent neo-nazism			1
the cell imploded after a botched bank robbery in november 2011 , 13 years after they went underground to live from the proceeds of similar heists across the country			0

accused : @entity100 , a member of the neo-nazi group @entity103 before the start of her trial in @entity160 there are an estimated 22,000 extremists and nearly half are estimated to be violent by security services			1
@entity0 also has a number of summer camps and special schools brainwashing youngsters into worshipping a movement that killed six million @entity170 in the @entity171			2
a raid in 2011 on one camp turned up jigsaw puzzles showing @entity0 's @entity176 borders and colouring books where children were encouraged to crayon in the moustache of @entity180			1

worry : there is increasing concern that @entity0 children are being brainwashed by neo-nazis who send them on @entity180 - worshipping summer camps , much like those experienced by the @entity191			2
