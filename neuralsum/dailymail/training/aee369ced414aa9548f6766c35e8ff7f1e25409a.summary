by @entity1 reporter published : 04:27 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 08:05 est , 5 march 2013 the jury in the trial of a @entity5 police officer accused of conspiring to cannibalism were forced to watch a video of a woman made to appear to be cooked over an open flame			1
the evidence , taken from websites devoted to torturing and eating women visited by officer @entity13 , also included images of women with apples in their mouths and instructions on ‘ how to cook a girl ’			1
the government rested a week after it began trying to prove that @entity13 tried to conspire with others on the @entity22 to kidnap , kill and cannibalize six women , including friends and his wife			1
on trial : @entity13 visited websites containing instructions on how to tie up , ' chloroform ' and cook a girl earlier , @entity33 computer forensics examiner @entity34 testified @entity13 frequently visited websites showing women being tortured , including one that offered images of women who did not survive			1

one cannibalism website allegedly visited by @entity13 promised customers they would ‘ only receive the highest quality human beef			1
’ the jury also heard how the officer allegedly looked up ‘ how to tie up a girl , ’ '' human meat recipes , ’ ‘ how to chloroform a girl , ’ ‘ i want to sell a girl slave , ’ ‘ how to cook a girl , ’ ‘ death fetish ’ and ‘ huge cooking tray ’ among other topics the defense says were part of a fetish fantasy that never posed a real threat			1
view of @entity71 in @entity47 where the trial of @entity74 officer @entity13 , accused of conspiring to kidnap women that he planned to cook and eat , began an undated photo submitted as evidence shows @entity13 with his daughter			1
@entity13 is accused of conspiracy to kidnap a woman and unauthorized use of a law enforcement database that prosecutors say he used to help build a list of potential targets the video showed to the jury , which was found by the @entity33 on @entity13 ’s computer , is apparently staged and shows a naked , screaming woman hanging over an open flame			1
two images of naked women roasting on a giant spit were discovered in a computer file of several dozen photographs that @entity13 kept on a former college friend whom prosecutors have identified as a target of the alleged plot			2
the face of one woman prosecutors say he targeted was cut out and pasted onto a cartoon of a woman being boiled in a pot. prosecutors also had wanted to present as many as 34 exhibits of even more ghastly images found on @entity13 's computer depicting women being tortured , dead bodies and body parts			2
they include a picture of a dead body with the feet cut off which @entity13 's wife testified she saw when she went to one of his favorite sites and discovered why he stayed up late online			2
however @entity119 district judge @entity118 ruled they were not admissible because they were automatically stored in cache files on @entity13 's computer			0
‘ what we do n't have is proof that he ever saw the images here , ’ he said at the start of the second week of the trial			0
wife : in this courthouse sketch , @entity131 , right , testifies about discovering her husband 's sick fetish for torturing and eating women on trial : in this courtroom sketch , @entity13 is seen in federal court in @entity5 as his wife , @entity131 testifies cannibal cop : the former @entity5 police officer @entity13 , is alleged to have conspired to kidnap , kill and eat six women , including his wife however , the judge permitted the screenshots of @entity146 's internet searches about cannibalism as well as proof that the officer looked up articles written about the rape and murder of a young woman and others about a 15 - year - old girl who was kidnapped and murdered in @entity156			1
the browsing history also showed that an article titled ‘ @entity159 can be addictive , expert says ’ and @entity162 pages of alleged targets were viewed			0
as soon as the government finished , defense lawyers asked the judge to acquit their client , saying prosecutors failed to present sufficient evidence to let a jury decide whether @entity13 planned to carry out a crime			2
defense attorney @entity174 said it has not yet been decided whether the officer will testify			0
earlier in the trial , prosecutors claimed the 28 - year - old was involved in online chats with a @entity182 man to whom he offered his ex wife for meat			2
at @entity187 last week , testimony by @entity33 agent @entity186 outlined an an online chat between @entity13 and a man named @entity190 last year , where @entity190 said he ' would love to slaughter a girl and make her meat '			2

jurors have heard testimony from @entity13 's estranged wife and from former classmates and other women who said they knew @entity13 on a casual basis and never considered him dangerous			1
their testimony was followed by evidence that all of them were the subjects of emails and chats describing how they could be snatched away and eaten			0
