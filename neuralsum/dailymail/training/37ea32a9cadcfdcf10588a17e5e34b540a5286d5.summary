but with @entity29 and @entity42 closing in , she missed a pair halfway through the round and gave herself a dressing down before holding her nerve over the final few shots			2
' it feels pretty good , i ca n't quite believe it , ' @entity2 told @entity1			2
' the @entity6 obviously like me , it 's a good event to come to			1
' i was laughing because i did n't realise i was five targets ahead at the start , so i thought ' no pressure ! ' then i felt it was slipping away from me a little bit , which was n't good			0
but now it feels amazing			0
' congratulations : @entity2 gets a hug after easing to victory in the shooting double trap event @entity2 will have little opportunity to celebrate , though , as she lines up in her favoured event , the @entity71 trap , on monday morning			1
' that will be good experience for tomorrow because now i know what to expect with the crowd and everything			0
' there 's no time to celebrate yet			2
tomorrow is what i have been training for			0
my coach thinks i was crazy going for this one as well but i 'm going to be more confident now			0
' for @entity82 , who claimed silver behind @entity2 in the individual event eight years ago , it was also a test of nerve in the shoot - off			2
' i 've practised doing that before with the other @entity3 guys , i knew what was coming and i knew i 'd done it before and i could do it again - and i did , ' she said			0
