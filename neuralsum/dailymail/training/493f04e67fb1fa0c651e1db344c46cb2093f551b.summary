' peaches had joined the group , which promotes ' attachment parenting ' , in september last year			2
attachment parenting is based on the belief that the first year of a child 's life defines its emotional future and parents should therefore remain as physically close to their child as possible			1

earlier this week , a friend of @entity2 's late mother @entity97 claimed she desperately tried to confront the young model over her drug abuse , as friends around her ' turned blind eyes '			1
ms @entity6 said @entity2 obviously missed her mother , @entity97 , pictured right , particularly after her own children were born @entity104 , the former publicist of @entity97 , said she wrote a letter to peaches six years ago in a bid to stop her suffering the same fate as her mother , ms @entity97 died of an accidental heroin overdose when @entity2 was 11			1
but she said @entity2 , a mother - of - two , suffered after those around her ' said nothing ' - despite the 25 - year - old relapsing			1
she told @entity114 magazine : ' i knew she was in trouble with heroin years ago and i tried to confront her about it			0

' she said she found the world of celebrity very shallow since she 'd become a mother ' @entity6 in november 2013 , a drugs test showed her to be clean and mr @entity125 believed she had defeated the habit			1
but mr @entity125 , a 24 - year - old musician , told the inquest she relapsed in february and was hiding heroin in the loft			1
mr @entity148 said @entity2 ' death was not quite history repeating itself , in regards to miss @entity97 ' death , because miss @entity2 had tried to break her addiction and had returned to the drug for reasons no one would ever know			0
she had 3mg per litre of diamorphine , the chemical name for heroin , in her blood			0
her mother had 0.3mg when she died			0
