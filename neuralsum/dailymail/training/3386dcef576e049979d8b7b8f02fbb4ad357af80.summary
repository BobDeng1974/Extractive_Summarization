by @entity0 published : 07:41 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 08:39 est , 27 february 2013 for the first time in 13 years , the music industry has seen an increase in worldwide revenues , thanks in no small part to @entity8 hitmakers			1
three @entity8 acts - @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 - who all won at the @entity14 awards last week , helped boost global music sales by 0.3 per cent in 2012 to £ 10.9billion ( $ 16.5billion )			1
the figures were released yesterday by the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , which represents 1,400 record companies worldwide			1
the growth may be modest , but for an industry which had seen revenues crash more than 40 per cent since its 1999 peak as it battled rampant internet piracy , it was almost cause to break into song			1
for the first time in 13 years , the music industry has seen an increase in worldwide revenues - up by 0.3 per cent in 2012 to £ 10.9bn ( $ 16.5bn ) @entity8 soul diva @entity10 helped boost global music revenues with her album 21			1
pictured above , performing at the @entity30 earlier this week @entity10 's album reached 8.3million sales globally , while @entity33 sold 2.3million ' it is hard to remember a year for the recording industry that has begun with such a palpable buzz in the air , ' said @entity38 , chief executive of the @entity39 - based @entity17			1
' these are hard - won successes for an industry that has innovated , battled and transformed itself over a decade			2
' they show how the music industry has adapted to the internet world , learned how to meet the needs of consumers and monetised the digital marketplace			2
' soul diva @entity10 's album 21 became the first record to top the global album sales chart for a second year running - selling 8.3million units in 2012			1
also in the top ten best - sellers worldwide were @entity11 ( with @entity54 and @entity55 in third and fourth place respectively , each with over 4million sales ) and @entity12 at number nine , with @entity60 which shifted 2.3million			1

their album @entity54 reached sales of 4.5million last year 1			1

@entity79 ( @entity80 ) , 2.2m source : @entity17 meanwhile , @entity75 's album , @entity82 , came in at number ten , with sales of 2.6million			1
the @entity17 said paid - for digital music downloads from sites such as @entity88 's @entity87 , along with other new sources of revenue , had finally grown enough to compensate for the decline of cd sales			1
digital revenues grew by 9 per cent in 2012 , the organisation said , bringing their share of total industry revenues to 34 per cent			1
across the world , 4.3billion songs and albums were downloaded in 2012			1
the @entity17 also said subscription - based @entity101 music services such as @entity102 and @entity103 had leapt 44 per cent last year , giving them 20million users worldwide			1
some subscription services allow users to listen to songs for free with adverts played every few minutes , while others provide advertising - free music for a monthly fee			2
but the @entity17 admitted that the industry still faces ' major hurdles ' in adjusting to the internet age			1
' our markets remain rigged by illegal free music , ' said @entity38			0
' this is a problem where governments have a critical role to play , in particular by requiring more cooperation from advertisers , search engines , @entity124 ( @entity124 ) and other intermediaries			0
' the @entity17 figures also revealed that @entity128 singer @entity127 topped the global singles chart for 2012 with her single @entity130 , followed by @entity132 's somebody i used to know			1
@entity135 sensation psy came third with @entity136 , which made history in december when it became the first @entity139 video to be viewed a billion times			0
@entity10 wins @entity142 award at this year 's oscars for @entity144 from the @entity146 film downloads , streaming and the ever - present threat of piracy @entity151 , of @entity8 - based @entity153 consulting , warned that the figures did not mean the industry had put its misery years behind it			1
' we 're probably near the bottom , ' he said , ' but it 's so marginal we could easily have another year or two where it could get worse			2
' the physical music market - everything from vinyl records to dvds - continues to contract , losing another $ 500 million in revenue between 2011 and 2012			2
the industry group has placed its bets on downloads , streaming , and subscription services to make up for lost ground , but there 's still a long way to go			2
mega man : megaupload founder @entity177 launches his new file - sharing site ' @entity179 ' surrounded by dancers downloads and streaming audio now account for most of the music sold in the @entity184 and @entity185 , but physical music still accounts for the majority of industry revenue worldwide			2
illegal music downloads remain a problem worldwide , particularly in potentially huge markets such as @entity192 , @entity193 , and @entity194			2
@entity38 urged governments to follow the example of the international enforcement action against @entity198 founder @entity177 , accused by @entity184 prosecutors of facilitating millions of illegal downloads			0
@entity177 , who is fighting an attempt to extradite him from @entity202 to the @entity184 , denies the allegations			0
the report hailed the action against @entity198 and sites like @entity207 - which has been blocked by several @entity209 countries - but it estimated that 32 per cent of all internet users still regularly downloaded pirated music			2
' what other industry has to cope with a third of its customers being able to get copies of its products from illegal services ? " @entity38 said			0
with growth uneven across various countries and piracy still a stubborn problem , it could take years for the industry to return to its previous health			0
@entity151 said he believes some of the lost revenue may never be recovered , with many casual users who used to buy the odd cd turning to free services such as @entity139 , television music channels , or internet radio instead			0
' this is a case of managed decline , ' he said , predicting ' a sustainable but smaller market built around more engaged music fans			0
