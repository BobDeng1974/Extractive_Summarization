by @entity0 in 1971 @entity1 played golf on the moon			0
in 2007 @entity4 played @entity5 on the @entity6			0
and now , in 2014 , a cricket ball has joined the the exclusive club of sporting objects that have been sent to space - or at least to the edge of it			1
the stunt was part of an event to launch a new cricket season called the @entity27 the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) sent the cricket ball to the edge of space for what they claim is the first time			1
it was a stunt for the start of a competition that starts today called the @entity27 competition			0
this sees 18 counties from @entity28 @entity39 compete in an 11 - week season of cricket			2
to perform the feat the @entity28 worked with a team of aeronautical engineers to launch the official match ball from @entity45 , @entity46 the ball reached a peak altitude of 110,000 feet ( 33,000 metres ) , about three times the height at which a commercial airplane cruises			1
it was attached to a helium balloon in order to ascend and endured temperatures of -54 ° c ( -130 ° f )			1
the official boundary from @entity57 to space is said to be the @entity59			0
this is a line named after @entity62 physicist @entity61 , who first postulated its existence , that is 62 miles ( 100 kilometres ) , or 330,000 feet , above sea level			2
at this altitude , @entity57 's atmosphere is said to be too thin to support aeronautical flight and anything here can be said to be in the vacuum of space			0
however , to truly escape from any influence of @entity57 one must travel further			0
for example @entity57 's exosphere , a volume of molecules that are bound to our planet but with an extremely low density , extends out to 10,000 kilometres ( 6,200 miles )			0
only 24 humans , those of the @entity85 missions , have ever travelled beyond the edge of @entity57 's exosphere			0
the cricket ball was launched from @entity45 in @entity46 ( pictured )			1
it survived temperatures of -54 ° @entity90 ) before plummeting back to @entity57 and landing in @entity91 , @entity92 by parachute at peak height the balloon popped , sending the ball plummeting to @entity57 at up to 500 miles ( 800 kilometres ) per hour before a parachute deployed to bring it safely back to the planet in @entity91 , @entity92 in near - perfect condition			1
‘ ahead of the launch of the @entity27 season , we wanted to do something that would reflect the competition ’s exciting brand of cricket and vibrant in - ground atmosphere , ’ said @entity101 , @entity28 chief executive , in a statement			2
‘ by sending a cricket ball to the edge of space , we ’ve come up with an innovative idea which vividly illustrates our own plans to make this summer ’s @entity27 competition a truly memorable experience for cricket fans everywhere			1

the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) has sent a ball to ' space '
the cricket ball was launched on a helium balloon from @entity46
it reached a height of 110,000 feet when the balloon popped and it fell
upon its *return* it reached speeds of 500 miles per hour before landing
a parachute brought it safely down to land in @entity91 , @entity92
