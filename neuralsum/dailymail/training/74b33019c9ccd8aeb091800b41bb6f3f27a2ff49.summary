@entity0 have added @entity2 's @entity1 to their list of potential defensive targets for the summer			1
the 24 - year - old has four years left on contract and recently returned from nine months out with a pelvic injury			0
@entity1 has already shown glimpses of the form that earned him recognition with @entity11 and @entity0 are monitoring his performances			2
@entity0 are keeping a close eye on @entity2 and @entity11 defender @entity1 @entity2 would be reluctant to sell and would demand at least £ 20million			1
@entity0 have also considered @entity14 at @entity15 and @entity17 's @entity16 while @entity18 of @entity19 has been offered as he has yet to agree new terms and is free in the summer			0
but it remains to be seen if @entity22 can be enticed into pouncing upon another cheap arrival from the @entity24 , after signing goalkeeper @entity25 in january , who was out of contract having departed @entity19 last summer			0
the @entity0 boss wants a right - back , centre - back , midfielder , a winger and a striker to bolster his squad in the summer			2
@entity2 right back @entity1 has made an impressive return after nine months out with pelvic injury @entity0 are also keeping tabs on @entity15 defender @entity14 he had been strongly linked with @entity15 's @entity14 , who has enjoyed another impressive season on the south coast under @entity40 and has even broken into the @entity11 squad			1
but @entity1 's resurgence under @entity43 after returning from injury has impressed the @entity0 manager			2
and @entity46 clearly wants a stronger option than 19 - year - old @entity48 , who has been deputising ahead of @entity49 in recent matches			0
@entity17 's @entity16 could also be an option as @entity22 wants to sign a right back @entity22 wants to sign right back , centre back , midfielder , a winger and a striker in the summer @entity46 will be hoping he can lead his side to a convincing victory over @entity58 at the @entity59 on saturday			1
@entity58 inflicted a 2 - 1 defeat upon the 63 - year - old at @entity62 in his first game as @entity0 boss in august and he will look to avenge the scoreline with three points that would strengthen his team 's place in the top four of the league .			0
