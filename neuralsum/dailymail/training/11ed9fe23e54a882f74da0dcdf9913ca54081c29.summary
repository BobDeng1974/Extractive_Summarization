two long - standing political stalwarts who were expected to face defeat in primary elections held on to their seats in a night of unexpected turnarounds yesterday			2
six - term senator @entity5 of @entity6 edged out tea party - backed challenger @entity7 in a bruising , costly @entity11 runoff that pitted @entity13 clout against @entity15 values and an insistence on conservative purity			1
in @entity24 's @entity22 and upper @entity23 , 84 - year - old @entity19 representative @entity18 , a 22 - term congressman and the third - most - senior member of the @entity21 , celebrated after leading the vote 47 to 44 per cent - but his challenger refused to concede			1
the @entity38 - supported candidate won the primary in the first round , but did n't secure enough votes to win the nomination outright so it went into a runoff with 99 per cent of precincts reporting , @entity5 had 51 per cent to @entity7 's 49 per cent , three weeks after @entity7 had beaten the veteran lawmaker in the initial primary round but had fallen short of the majority needed for nomination			1
in the three - week dash to the runoff , @entity5 and his allies had highlighted his seniority while @entity7 had argued that @entity5 was part of a blight of federal overspending			1
in a brief speech , @entity5 credited those who helped			0
' it 's a group effort , it 's not a solo and so we all have a right to be proud of our state tonight			0
' @entity7 savaged the @entity11 on tuesday night after his narrow defeat			1
according to the @entity65 , he condemned @entity5 for courting @entity19 voters			0
he told supporters : ' [ the @entity11 ] was a party of principle at one point			2
a party of courage at one point			0
it was @entity73 that said , '' we will be a party of bold colors , not pastels			0
'' and yet there are millions of people who feel like strangers in their own party			0
' he continued : ' there is something a bit unusual about a @entity11 primary that 's decided by @entity87			1
so much for bold colors			0
i guess they can take some consolation that they did something tonight by once again compromising , by once again reaching against the aisle , by once again abandoning the conservative movement			0
' the victory for a stalwart of the @entity99 was a fresh blow to the tea party movement , which spent millions to cast aside @entity5 , a mainstream @entity11 who won a @entity104 @entity21 seat in president @entity106 's @entity11 wave of 1972 and has served in the @entity99 for more than three decades			1
in another setback for the tea party , two - term representative @entity107 of @entity108 won the @entity11 nomination in the race to succeed senator @entity113 , who is stepping down with two years left in his term			1
in the solidly @entity11 state , @entity115 is all but assured of becoming the next senator			2
part of the @entity21 @entity11 leadership , @entity115 defeated @entity120 , a member of the @entity121 and the state 's first black @entity21 speaker , backed by former vice presidential candidate @entity38 and @entity125 senator @entity124 , two stalwarts of the right			1
despite @entity130 ' abysmal public approval ratings , incumbents have largely prevailed midway through the primary season — with two notable exceptions			0
victory hug : two - term @entity104 representative @entity107 is embraced by his wife @entity135 after securing the @entity11 's nomination to run for the @entity99 end of the road : @entity107 beat out @entity120 ( pictured ) , a member of the @entity121 and the state 's first black @entity21 speaker , who was supported by former vice-presidential candidate @entity38 and @entity125 senator @entity124			1
@entity120 pictured above giving his concession speech little - known college professor @entity141 knocked out @entity21 majority leader @entity142 in @entity144 's @entity11 primary this month , and @entity145 representative @entity145 , 91 , lost in a @entity125 runoff to a younger @entity145			1
@entity7 declared as he voted tuesday , ' we are here , we 're going to fight for our belief system no matter what , and we 're going to reclaim @entity13 , one race at a time			2
' but @entity5 and his allies , notably former governor @entity153 , promoted his @entity13 establishment credentials , focusing on the billions he funneled to his home state , one of the poorest in the nation			2
in a last - ditch effort , @entity5 reached out to traditionally @entity19 voters — blacks and union members — who could cast ballots in the runoff			2
that possible factor in @entity5 's victory is sure to be cited by critics in days and weeks to come			2
in predominantly black neighborhoods of @entity169 's south side , an organized effort for @entity5 was evident			0
@entity171 , a 50 - year - old unemployed @entity169 man , said he had been encouraged by his pastor to vote for @entity5			0
majority wins : @entity5 supporters beam with joy at his victory party in @entity177 , @entity6 on tuesday night civic duty : @entity7 and his wife @entity180 vote in the primary race on tuesday with the help of their patriotically - dressed children ' they say the other guy is trying to cut food stamps and all that , ' @entity171 said			1
' i 'm trying to look after the majority of people not working			0
' @entity7 had railed against the federal ' spending sprees ' by @entity5 but his calls to slash the budget unnerved some voters			2
@entity196 , a 71 - year - old retired tax administrator from @entity198 , voted for @entity5			0
' i believe he is doing a good job , ' @entity196 said			0
' but mostly i 'm more scared of the other candidate			0
he wants to do things like not taking school funding when everyone else is			0
' the @entity6 contest was the marquee race on a busy june primary day that included @entity24 , @entity108 , @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209			1
in a special @entity21 election on @entity213 's @entity212 , voters chose @entity11 businessman @entity214 to replace former representative @entity215 , who resigned in january after pleading guilty to cocaine possession			1
in @entity24 's @entity22 and upper @entity23 , 84 - year - old @entity19 representative @entity18 , a 22 - term congressman and the third - most - senior member of the @entity21 , held a slight edge over state senator @entity219 , bidding to become the first @entity221 - @entity104 member of @entity130			1
with 99 percent of precincts reporting , @entity18 had 47 per cent of the vote compared to @entity219 's 44 percent , according to the @entity224			1
@entity219 has refused to concede with votes still to be counted			2
@entity18 seemed content to celebrate his apparent victory at an election party in @entity22			1
according to @entity228 , he told the crowd : ' i think this election is historic			0
it shows the changes taking place in @entity104			0
' @entity18 , the face of @entity22 politics for generations , raised his arms aloft and smiled			2
there is not a @entity11 contender for the seat , all but assuring @entity18 's 23rd term in @entity130			1
' this was your victory , ' @entity18 told the crowd			0
' this is your congressman			0
and you can rest assured all i will be doing is thinking about you and bringing resources back home			0
' @entity18 wins : @entity18 , who has represented @entity24 's @entity22 and upper @entity23 in the @entity21 for 22 terms , won his party 's nomination again by beating state senator @entity219 in the tuesday primary			1
pictured above at his victory party his house : 84 - year - old @entity18 is the third most senior member of the @entity21 not giving up : though @entity18 led in the polls tuesday night , @entity219 refused to concede saying the race was too close to call @entity18 , one of the founders of the @entity261 , drew criticism last month when he dismissed the 59 - year - old @entity219 as a candidate whose only accomplishment was to be a @entity221 in a majority latino district			1
two years ago , @entity18 prevailed in the primary by fewer than 1,100 votes			0

in @entity207 on tuesday , former representative @entity298 won the crowded gubernatorial primary that included 2008 presidential candidate @entity300 , an immigration opponent			1
that was welcome news to national republicans who feared that @entity300 could be a drag on the @entity11 ticket in november			2
@entity298 will face @entity19 governor @entity307			0
in @entity208 , lieutenant governor @entity308 won the @entity19 primary for governor as the state chose a successor to outgoing @entity19 governor @entity313 , who is considering a 2016 presidential bid			2
