by @entity0 a cup of tea or a mug of ' cha ' might taste the same , but the choice of words for the brew can reveal a great deal about a person 's ancestry and even the history of the world			1
recently published maps plotting the different words used for various objects make it clear that a simple term can say a lot about a country			2
the infographics , posted by @entity23 user @entity21 , show that some seemingly mundane words can explain a country 's links to trade , its history of conflict and migration			1
the maps show how many words for ' tea ' found in different languages are ultimately of @entity35 origin			1
languages spoken in eastern @entity37 and @entity38 which got their tea overland rather than from the @entity40 tend to use forms such as chai for example , there are many words for ‘ tea ’ found in different languages but are all ultimately of the same @entity35 origin			1
those differences , however , give an insight into how the product arrived in the country			0
the @entity40 traders , who were the main importers of tea into @entity37 , had their main contacts in @entity56 in @entity57			1
for this reason they adopted the word for ‘ tea ’ as ' thee ' , and in this form it then spread to large parts of @entity37			1
the @entity65 word rose comes from @entity66 , which itself comes from @entity68 rosa - one of the languages that most influenced @entity65			2
interestingly , the map shows how garoful , the ancient @entity72 word for rose , today only remains in north eastern @entity74 the first @entity76 tea importers in the 16th century , however , were @entity77			1
@entity77 uses the term ' chá ' , derived from @entity80 ' cha '			0
as a result , languages spoken in eastern @entity37 and @entity38 which got their tea overland rather than from the @entity40 tend to use forms such as ' chai '			1
these @entity76 etymology maps provide a fascinating insight into how words have changed across a geographical area			2
the @entity65 word ' rose ' , for instance , comes from @entity66 , which itself comes from @entity68 ' rosa ' – one of the languages that most influenced @entity65			1
church is common to many @entity95 , @entity96 and other languages under various forms			2
in @entity100 it is kirche , in @entity103 kirka in @entity105 kirke and in @entity107 kirkko the modern @entity109 word for ‘ rose ’ is ' gul ' , which developed through a series of regular sound changes from the word ' varda '			1
interestingly , the map shows how ' garoful ' , the ancient @entity72 word for ' rose ' , today only remains in the north east of @entity74			0
the maps also reveals how @entity72 influenced the @entity65 word ' church '			1
' @entity94 ' is common to many @entity121 , @entity96 and other languages under various forms			0
in @entity100 it is ' kirche ' , in @entity103 ' kirka ' , in @entity105 ' kirke ' and in @entity107 ' kirkko '			0
these all originate from the @entity72 word ' ecclesia ' which means ‘ assembly ’ , with the meaning of the word transferred from the community to the building			2
in many places the pineapple has a name similar to ananas derives from nana , a @entity139 term for the fruit			0
@entity141 is alleged to have named the pineapple , calling it the ' pine of the @entity145 ' due to its resemblance to a pine cone the word pineapple , however , seems to be something of an anomaly			0
in many countries , it has a name similar to ' ananas ' , which derives from ' nana ' , a @entity139 term for the fruit			0
@entity141 is alleged to have named the pineapple , calling it the ‘ pine of the @entity145 ’ due to its resemblance to a pine cone			2
another unusual word illustrated on a map is for the orange fruit			0
in the @entity166 it comes from @entity167 ( ‘ orange tree ’ )			0
' @entity169 ' has a lot of diversity			0
the word in @entity107 and @entity173 may come from an @entity175 origin however , the dominant word in much of eastern and northern @entity37 comes from a word meaning ' apple ' from @entity35 , such as the @entity40 word ‘ sinaasappel			1
’ ‘ @entity169 ’ , meanwhile , has a great deal of diversity			0
the word in @entity107 and @entity173 may come from an @entity175 origin			0
‘ @entity186 ’ seems to be influenced by @entity184 which has the largest brown bear population in @entity37 can be found			1
the most dominant word literally means ‘ honey - eater			0
’ @entity186 seems to be influenced by @entity184 which has the largest brown bear population in @entity37 can be found			2

words in the maps , such as rose , church and tea , show a shared history
for instance , differences in the word ' tea ' are largely due to trade routes
@entity40 traders had their main contacts in @entity57 and used ‘ tea ’ or ' thee ;
@entity37 and @entity38 , which got their tea overland , tend to use forms such as chai
