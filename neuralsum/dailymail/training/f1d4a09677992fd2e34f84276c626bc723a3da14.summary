@entity0 has been told it must look after passengers when flights are grounded by natural catastrophes , strikes and technical faults			1
the @entity6 ruling yesterday means the airline must cover the cost of meals , hotels and transport			1
the case dates back to the disruption caused by the eruption of a volcano in @entity16 in 2010			0
angry : @entity0 boss @entity17 said that the @entity6 's ruling may cause some airlines to go bust passengers were stranded across @entity22			1
@entity0 alone cancelled 9,400 flights due to the ash cloud			1
the ruling is a blow to @entity0 boss @entity27 , who at first refused to abide by @entity29 laws which state airlines should support stranded passengers until they fly them home			1
after pressure from ministers , he was forced into a u-turn , but @entity0 then became embroiled in a legal battle to limit future refunds			2
the @entity6 ruling follows on from a @entity40 court ’s decision earlier this week to allow passengers to claim damages after long delays , as reported in the @entity44 yesterday			1
the ruling was made after passenger @entity46 was stranded in @entity47 , @entity48 after volcano @entity50 erupted			1
she claimed 1,130 euros , or £ 970 , to cover costs incurred while she was stuck			1
the volcanic eruption left millions of passengers unable to return home because it was deemed too dangerous to fly through the ash clouds			0
today 's ruling could leave airlines open to a raft of future claims			2
the court recognised compensation claims could have ' substantial negative economic consequences ' for airlines , but said a high level of protection must be afforded to passengers			0
the court also said airlines should foresee any costs but pointed out that ticket prices could be hiked as a result			2
mr @entity17 said the court 's decision made the airlines ' insurers of last resort ' and said whoever was responsible for cancellations should pay compensation			1
@entity79 hike ? budget airline @entity0 said that it may have to put its prices up due to a ruling that airlines must cover the cost of stranded passengers expenses he blamed the government for closing @entity40 airspace in 2010 , even though ' there was clearly no ash cloud over the @entity40			1
' he said : ' we now have a position that when the next time there 's an ash cloud or the skies are closed by @entity22 's governments , the travel insurance companies will walk away and wash their hands and say it was an act of @entity100 and the airlines will become the insurers of last resort			1
' ' somebody who has paid us fifty quid to travel to the @entity106 , who may be stuck there for two weeks , two months , six months , will now sue the airlines and you will have airlines going out of business , and the ones who stay in business will be putting up the air fares to recover these crazy claims			0
' mr @entity17 said @entity0 had paid out to everyone affected by the volcano eruption in 2010 , including ms @entity46 , but had still not covered costs despite introducing a compensation surcharge			1
stranded : hundreds of flights were cancelled in 2010 when a volcano erupted in @entity16 he added : ' it 's a crazy decision , it 's another crazy decision coming from the @entity22 court			2
' you ca n't expect us to be providing compensation for the world and his mother when we are prevented from flying			0
' why does somebody have to pay ? why do we take responsibility for something that has been caused by others ? ' this compensation culture is running riot in this country			0
' the @entity138 ( @entity139 ) today reiterated its advice to passengers affected by flight delays and cancellations and advised passengers who were not being treated properly to contact them			0
passengers whose flights are delayed or cancelled are entitled to assistance from the airline such as food , drinks and accommodation where necessary , the @entity139 said			0
in addition , passengers whose flights have been cancelled at short notice or arrive three hours or more later than scheduled are also entitled to claim for compensation - unless the delay or cancellation was out of the airline 's control			0
a @entity139 spokesman said : ' these regulations are in place to protect people when things go wrong with their flights			0
' anyone with concerns that they are not being treated correctly by their airline can contact the @entity139 for advice or to make a complaint			0
' @entity0 also issued an official statement this afternoon warning of hikes in fares after the ruling			2
it read : ' @entity0 regrets the decision of the @entity6 which now allows passengers to claim for flight delays which are clearly and unambiguously outside of an airline 's control			1
stuck : passengers pictured stranded at @entity183 during the ash cloud crisis ' today 's decision will materially increase the cost of flying across @entity22 and consumer airfares will increase as airlines will be obliged to recover the cost of these claims from their customers , because the defective @entity22 regulation does not allow us to recover such costs from the governments or unions who are responsible for over 95 per cent of flight delays in @entity22			1
' like other carriers , the airline said it had already paid out millions of pounds in compensation to passengers affected by the ash cloud			1
but it contested ms @entity46 's case because it deemed the amount to be ' excessive '			2
the case centred around the @entity29 261 regulations , a @entity22 law which means carriers were obliged to refund the bills of thousands of passengers caught up in the crisis which put a ban on great swathes of airspace			0
it was seen as a test case as @entity0 was the only airline to take a challenge to the @entity22 courts			2
last october the @entity6 decided that delays of more than three hours , where the airline was at fault - because of technical faults or lack of flight crew , for example - warranted compensation			0
with 200million passengers using @entity40 airports annually , and around 2million of those delayed by more than three hours , that may result in 400,000 fliers eligible for refunds every year			0
@entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 and the @entity238 ( @entity238 ) had all opposed that ruling			0
compensation to @entity40 customers was put on hold until the final ruling in october .			0

the @entity6 ruled that airlines must cover stranded customers ' costs
the ruling was made after passenger @entity46 claimed 1,130 euros after getting stranded in the 2010 ash cloud crisis
@entity0 boss @entity17 said the ruling could see some airlines go bust
