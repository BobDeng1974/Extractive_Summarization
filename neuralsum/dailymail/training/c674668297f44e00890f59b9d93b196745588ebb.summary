@entity0 was nicknamed ‘ @entity5 ’ by his @entity2 team - mates at the @entity3 at @entity4			1
the singles were about to begin when he made a vow : ‘ i will deliver my point			1
@entity0 delivered three points from four matches then and four from five at @entity13 two years earlier			1
his first - ever @entity15 point , at @entity16 in 2004 , technically won the trophy that year			1
his four points from four matches during the miracle in @entity20 two years ago were more momentous still			2
@entity0 celebrates his brilliant 50 - yard chip - in that rescued half a point at @entity23 on saturday @entity0 showed his passion and despite being out of form he is again proving invaluable to @entity2 @entity0 's team - mates view him as a talisman to their hopes and he has helped them to their lead so to arrive here at @entity23 , out of form and down on inspiration , in @entity34 ’s team only as a captain ’s pick and not a certain starter , has brought a new pressure on the 38 - year - old			1
and he looked under every ounce of it on friday as he and rookie @entity42 were drubbed 5 & 4 by the @entity44 rookies @entity45 and @entity46 in the morning fourballs			2
but yesterday , at 12.29pm , @entity0 took a parcel of magic and dropped it on this biggest of stages			1
the @entity52 fourball pair of @entity53 and @entity54 were one up on @entity0 and his partner @entity55			1
@entity53 had hit a peach of an approach to the 15th to guarantee himself a birdie and a likely two - hole lead in the match with three holes to play			2
@entity0 ’s first shot had hit the rough and his second sat 50 yards from the pin , next to a bunker			1
he addressed the ball , glanced up , took a short backswing and chipped			2
the ball carried , and bounced ... and dropped			2
the sound that came from @entity0 ’s mouth was something between ‘ yes ! ’ and ‘ @entity72 ’ , only longer , much longer			1
he did n’t so much pump both fists as his entire upper body , more than once , in a visceral release			0
@entity0 and @entity76 ca n't quite bring themselves to watch during the @entity78 @entity55 congratulates @entity0 on his utterly brilliant chip - in - even the @entity80 1 was impressed ! the crowd responded , tumultuously , and then , most importantly of all , @entity0 carried the momentum , sank a brilliant putt at the next to level the match and contributed significantly as he and @entity55 held on for a half			1
‘ there was a lot of emotion , it ’s been waiting to come out , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ it took way too long for it to do so but it was nice to be able to do it in that fashion			0
‘ obviously i have n’t played my best golf [ here ]			0
you just have to get something going			0
you have to stay positive			0
you have to keep telling yourself that good stuff ’s coming			0
i ’ve got a big heart and i love this @entity15			1
’ it was put to @entity0 that he had been playing ‘ like a drain ’ up until that point			1
he took the observation on the chin , although he rightly pointed out he made two early birdies yesterday before ‘ i kind of fell asleep in the middle [ of the match ]			0
then it was nice to get the juices flowing			0
not much has gone in the hole yet so far this week			0
’ @entity0 is the centre of attention of the @entity23 crowd as he plays a shot out of the rough on the 18th he then pointed out he has featured just twice here , something that might have been construed as mild displeasure			1
not so , it appears			0
he said it was more important for him to contribute to the score ‘ from a team perspective ’			0
on the issue of being omitted yesterday afternoon just as he had hit form , he added : ‘ yeah , but there ’s also lots of other guys that want to play			0
only eight can get out on the golf course , we have 12 great players			0
there are no egos in this team , you have to respect the captain ’s decision			0
’ he had already made light of his nickname and the inevitability it would be mentioned			2
‘ funny things happen , do n’t they ? ’ he said			0
he joked that perhaps his moniker should now change to ‘ @entity142 ’ or ‘ @entity143 ’			0
@entity0 reacts to a putt as spectators look on in the beautiful surroundings at @entity23 it was a decent day for @entity0 - and he watches on at his tee shot off the 7th here @entity0 was then asked whether he would be making any vow to his captain , @entity34 , about delivery a point in the singles			1
‘ i ’m not telling you , ’ he smiled			0
his team - mate @entity156 interjected at that stage to add : ‘ that means he can guarantee a half			2
’ by close of play , @entity0 will certainly have finished his round			2
all eyes are on @entity0 as he hits a chip - he will be hoping to deliver again for @entity2 on sunday			1

@entity0 picked up his nickname at the 2010 @entity15
back then he vowed to deliver his point and duly did in a @entity2 win
his first ever @entity15 point technically won the trophy in 2004
this year has been his biggest test - and he has stood up to it
his brilliant 50 - yard chip was the *highlight* of saturday 's action
now he will want to guide @entity2 to another *victory* at @entity23
