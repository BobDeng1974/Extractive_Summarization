in the @entity1 , @entity0 gained a reputation for being a loudmouth ladette who enjoyed staying out partying and drinking pints			0
but these days the @entity8 @entity7 is more likely to be seen running round the park with her @entity10 , @entity12 , than falling out of a bar with @entity14			1
@entity0 told @entity15 she could n't be happier with life as a married mother - of - three and now she prefers hitting the gym rather than a night club			1
i love the gym buzz i get from a workout			2
' she added that she eats healthily and does n't diet as she wants to promote eating well to her children - @entity32 , 10 , @entity33 , six , and @entity34 , four			1
' once you have kids you need to have broccoli knocking about			0
you ca n't have a rock n ' roll fridge full of vodka , that 's not real life			1
i eat well and the kids eat well too , ' she said , ' but i 'm not dieting nibbling on a wafer , you have to be careful about that when you have daughters			0
i want them to see that i go to the gym and then come back and eat healthily rather than dieting			0
' @entity0 , who married @entity52 , the father of her two youngest children in 2013 , turned 40 last december and admitted she 's indifferent to the fuss made over the milestone			1
the @entity7 had a reputation for staying out late drinking in her twenties , pictured right with wine in hand in 1998 , but she said now she only drinks on special occasions , pictured left this week with @entity12 ' turning 40 is always made a thing of for women , it 's quite sexist as it is n't like that for men , ' she said			1
' i feel like women are made to feel it 's a big deal			1
they should either put on a brave face or rush to @entity73 the nearest @entity75 clinic			0
' for @entity0 , turning 40 was ' the best birthday i ever had ' as she had fun at a party and then went away with her family for a few days where she visited a spa and went horse riding			1
she added that age has brought her more self - confidence as well as domestic bliss			0
' my career is going well , i have three healthy kids and a lovely husband so it is easy for me to feel pleased with my lot whether i am 40 or not , ' she said			2
' i am in happy place , i 'm lucky			1
' as you get older , you care less about what people think and have more confidence , i 'm also fitter and healthy now			2
' @entity0 , pictured at an event in @entity96 this week , said celebrations for her 40th last december were the ' best birthday i ever had ' as she had a party and a weekend away with her husband and three children now she loves keeping fit , @entity0 is passionate about keeping her family active too			1
she said one of the best ways to do this is for everyone to take @entity12 for a walk in the park			0
' once you get the kids out the door and to the park they have a brilliant time away from tv and @entity115 screens , ' she said			0
dog lover @entity0 had @entity116 till his death in 2013 and then got @entity12 - who she loves to take everywhere with her ( he 's even passed his @entity119 health and safety test so he can join her at work )			1
he gets plenty of exercise on family dog walks and joins @entity0 on a weekly five mile run - but many pets are n't so lucky			2
research has found that almost half ( 43 per cent ) of the @entity129 's dog population is now classed as overweight			0
dog lover @entity0 , pictured with her first dog @entity116 who died in 2013 , is a brand ambassador for @entity133 the study by @entity133 found that two thirds of owners with overweight dogs did n't realise their pet 's health was at risk because of their size , and more than a third of owners admitted to making excuses for not meeting their dog 's recommended levels of exercise			2
as a brand ambassador for @entity133 , @entity0 is now helping them launch their @entity149 which gives owners an exercise and eating plan based on their dog 's breed , age and weight			2
@entity0 said : ' some owners can love their dogs too much and give them too many treats			0
and in the winter it can be hard to get out and take them for a walk			0
this is a fun way to keep your dog healthy			0
' @entity0 and her dog @entity12 are working with @entity133 to launch the new @entity149 , a personalised simple and effective tool to help owners understand their dog 's exercise and nutritional requirements			1
