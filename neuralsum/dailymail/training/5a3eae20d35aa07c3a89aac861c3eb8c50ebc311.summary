members of the @entity2 royal family have attacked a new film which portrays the founder and first king of their country as a bloodthirsty womaniser			1
prince @entity8 , the twentieth son of @entity9 , whose rise to power is shown in the film @entity12 , said the film could ' tarnish ' his father 's name and said he would try to have it banned			1
but the film opened amid controversy in the @entity20 capital , @entity21 , on thursday 12 december , attended by hundreds of high - profile guests			1
showing the film so publicly has been said to mark a low - point in relations between @entity20 and @entity2 , with @entity2 royals attacking the @entity43 regime for allowing the film , and @entity20 ministers accusing the @entity2 of funding rebel fighters			1
@entity12 is directed by @entity47 , one of @entity20 's best - known producers and most acclaimed directors , who is also a supporter of president @entity43			1
the film , which purports to show events leading up to the creation of @entity2 in 1932 , was also shown at a private screening in @entity55 on 11 september , a date which some has said was chosen to highlight alleged links between @entity2 and the 9/11 terror attacks			2
in the film , @entity62 , later commonly known as @entity9 , is portrayed as a merciless ruler who kills opponents in sword fights , orders that thieves have their hands cut off , stones those who have pre-marital sex , takes multiple wives for himself and deflowers virgins			2
in one scene , the character , played by @entity74 actors @entity75 and @entity76 , asks : ' what 's wrong with blood ? a kingdom is only taken with blood			0
' war : the film shows some of the fierce fighting which led to the foundation of the @entity2 state controversy : director @entity47 says he has received death threats as a result of the film taboo : the film is especially controversial as the @entity2 rulers are rarely criticised publicly in the @entity94 he then says : ' the sultan will never be obeyed but by the sword			1
' meanwhile a narrator says : ' a sword was raised for the sake of the kingdom and the sultan making the sand soaked with blood '			0
elements of the film also imply that @entity9 was susceptible to @entity108 influence , particularly after oil was discovered in @entity2			1
the film is especially controversial because the @entity2 rulers are not generally criticised in public in the @entity113 world			0
the @entity2 king is also a significant figure in @entity116 , as he is custodian of @entity117 and @entity118 , the religion 's two holiest places			0
reputation : children of @entity9 , shown here in 1934 , have said the film must not be allowed to ' tarnish ' his memory in response to the screening , which has been promoted on @entity20 state television , prince @entity8 tweeted a statement explaining that he was trying to persuade president @entity43 to ban the film			1
he said : ' i hope he responds positively in honouring @entity62 as a person			0
we can not let such unsuccessful works tarnish the image of a great historical figure like @entity62			0
' @entity137 , a political science professor at @entity138 in @entity139 , said the screening may bring @entity20 - @entity2 relations ' to the point of no return			2
' since the @entity20 rebellion began in 2011 , the two powers have been particularly fiercely opposed			0
the @entity2 government led criticism of president @entity43 's treatment of protesters in @entity21 , while @entity20 has complained to the @entity149 about its alleged support for rebel fighters			1
last month , president @entity43 was quoted by state media saying : ' @entity2 is leading the widest sabotage campaign in the @entity113 world			0
' he also accused them of paying rebels $ 2,000 a month each to fight government forces			0
@entity158 , a @entity20 cabinet minister , said : ' personally , i strongly encourage this movie			0
relations might mend once @entity2 corrects its policy , halts its support of terrorism and apologizes for what had happened in @entity20			2

@entity12 , by @entity47 , premiered in @entity20 on 12 december
it depicts the life of @entity9 , who founded the modern stat of @entity2
