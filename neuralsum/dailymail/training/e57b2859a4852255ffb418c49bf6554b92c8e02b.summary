germans are marking 25 years since the fall of the @entity2 , but it seems some ca n't resist reliving the ' bad old days ' of @entity4			1
deep in the forests of former @entity7 they are spending the night in an authentic @entity9 bunker - complete with military uniforms , rations and formal training for a @entity14 chemical attack			1
teenagers not yet born when the wall fell are among those signing up for the 14 - hour tour at the @entity19 , a 38,750 sq ft underground complex which once had enough supplies to last 130 occupants up to a year			1
nostalgia for the @entity23 : at 15 years old , @entity24 ( pictured ) was not yet born when the @entity2 fell in 1989 - but he is now one of a growing number of people spending the night as soldiers in a @entity9 - built @entity14 bunker hidden in the woods near the city of @entity31 listening in : a night in the bunker , which had a radio transmitter to reach the outside world , costs punters £ 87 including their rations shrine : the @entity9 re-enactors brush up on the news of the day next to a banner depicting @entity42 laid out on the conference table camouflage : @entity46 staircases leading to the 38,750 sq ft complex were concealed in a warehouse , with only this lookout post as a clue hidden in the woods near the city of @entity31 , it was one of at least 15 similar bunkers meant to serve as command and administrative centres in case of war			1
the airtight bunker - whose twin access staircases were concealed inside a warehouse - had decontamination units and oxygen tanks in case of a chemical weapons attack in the world outside			2
it also had cooking facilities , bedrooms , a dining room , its own power supply and a command centre which used telegraph wires and a radio transmitter to keep up contact with the outside world			2
but the bunker was not perfect - as it was not radiation - proof , and would have been safe for only a week in an all - out nuclear war			1
its active service ended in 1990 when @entity7 was reunified , and in 1997 it was turned into a museum which now has 20,000 visitors a year			1
rations : many original @entity7 food products were taken off the shelves after reunification in 1990 , and there is an interest in finding old examples			2
the biscuit in this picture are genuine , but the ' @entity96 field soup ' was produced later to poke fun at the regime say cheese ! visitor @entity100 , dressed as a soldier from the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) , photographs his friend @entity102 with a mannequin in a gas mask in the warehouse placed over the bunker			0
it now holds a military vehicle display drill : the 14 - hour overnight ' experience ' includes preparations for chemical warfare			0
the bunker had oxygen tanks and air filters cramped : @entity100 inspects his accommodation in a small dormitory			0
the phenomenon of reliving @entity4 is called @entity118 i call top bunk : @entity24 , 15 , assigns his fellow visitors to bunk beds			1
others will take part in the night watch to check for ' attacks ' dinner time : the participants preparing to cook for themselves			0
the bunker had supplies to keep inhabitants safe for up to a year not all of it survived , as top - secret aspects of a technical base in the warehouse over the bunker were destroyed completely			1
the warehouse now houses military vehicles instead			0
nowadays the @entity139 is a privately - owned museum which teams up with a local hotel for its £ 87 - a - night stays			1
visitors dress as @entity7 army soldiers for a more authentic experience and cook their own meals , before donning gas masks and training for a chemical weapons strike in the darkened woods			1
the more hardy among them take up night watches as well as sleeping in the bunker 's cramped , windowless dormitories			0
but it 's not quite the feat of endurance faced by their @entity9 predecessors , as the fee includes ' relaxation time ' the next morning in the hotel 's sauna			0
@entity164 , who helps run the tours , told @entity166 they were popular with visitors under 30			0
' the bunker is visited by some people to experience how such military installations were created and equipped , ' he said			0
' others are interested in the historical and political aspect that goes into these systems			0
' the level of interest is high because such military or intelligence objects are secret and unavailable to the public while they are in active operation			0
' ' younger people show an interest in the museum			0
they are often encouraged or taken by schools and parents to visit the bunker			0
' last week @entity7 marked 25 years since the fall of the @entity2 on november 9 , 1989			1
tv footage of jubilant @entity2 citizens perched atop the wall , an act which for decades would have earned them a gunshot to the back , inspired people around the world and has grown in legend to become the defining image of the fall of @entity4			2

right : a storage cupboard with original gas masks and filters saving lives : museum employee and ' sergeant ' @entity205 explains the functions of the original gas mask system to his visitors sharing a joke : the visitors arrive at the bunker at 6pm from a nearby hotel and leave at 8am - with the chance to unwind in the sauna pay attention : @entity205 explains the electronic bunker map to visitors during an overnight stay in the @entity19 strategy : ' @entity222 commander ' @entity223 ( right ) mimics a typical scene in the 1970s - era underground bunker 's committee room play a @entity9 officer : visitor @entity228 contemplates the state of the @entity14 next to a hand - drawn map in the control room young soldier : @entity24 examines military telecommunications equipment			2
the visit came 25 years after the fall of the @entity2 the @entity139 's popularity has increased with the rise of @entity118 , a phenomenon which sees @entity239 paying big money to relive the days of the @entity7 ( @entity7 )			1
the word is a combination of @entity243 ( @entity23 ) and nostalgia ( nostalgie ) , and came to prominence a decade ago with the release of the hit film @entity246 , @entity247 ! 1800 arrival and briefing at forest bunker 1830 @entity252 dinner with original @entity7 rations 2000 ' basic training ' and a bunker tour 2330 bed time - or start of the night watch 0730 wake - up call and ' breakfast sports ' 0800 vacate the bunker and debrief 0830 retreat to a sauna in nearby hotel the bafta - nominated bittersweet comedy followed the fictional character @entity266 , whose mother falls into a coma shortly before the @entity2 falls and awakes during the rise of capitalism			1
convinced she will be unable to accept @entity7 's brave new world , @entity266 goes to impossible lengths to trick his mother into thinking the communist state is still alive and well			2
the film was followed by a string of other cinema releases and tv shows which observed the everyday lives of people in the @entity7 , while manufacturers of nostalgia saw sales increase			2
other relics from the @entity286 past - such as the hat - wearing green man ( @entity287 ) marking road crossings in @entity2 - remained popular almost from the day the wall fell			2
so - called @entity118 sparked a debate in the @entity7 media when it emerged			1
while many said it was a good way to remember the past , some support groups accused the trend of ' glorifying ' the past and glossing over its downsides , which included stifling state surveillance and the execution of ' traitors '			0
a later hit about life in @entity7 , @entity302 ( 2006 ) , won the @entity304 for best foreign - language film by painting a much grimmer picture of the @entity7 - delving into the @entity9 's eavesdropping on those suspected of being disloyal to the regime , and the human tragedies it caused			2
but mr @entity164 insisted : ' our visitors are no more or less nostalgic than any other human being			0
' they want nothing more to learn from their own history , to see and understand the political history of their country , especially if they were not involved in intelligence or military service			0
' comrades : the bunker hidden deep in the forest has original @entity14 - era memorabilia , including this @entity7 radio and an image showing a @entity330 ( right ) and east @entity7 soldier with the motto : ' class brothers - weapons brothers - unified unconquerable ! ' a little out of date ! in one corner , a portrait of @entity338 secretary @entity337 hangs over a ' modern ' @entity341 computer ears close to the ground : military telecommunications devices in the bunker			1
the @entity9 were famed for their surveillance programmes hello operator : in the case of full - blown war between @entity23 and @entity352 , the bunker would have served as a vital command post affectionate : an original calendar which still hangs in the bunker museum carries a pencil sketch of an @entity7 military vehicle remembering the past : visitors @entity361 , @entity228 and @entity362 mingle during the £ 87 tour under memorabilia of the former communist @entity7 ( @entity7 ) - including the east @entity7 flag and portraits of @entity247 and other communist - era leaders			1

underground chamber was built by 1970s @entity7 secret police in a hidden *pocket* of forest near city of @entity31
*designed* as command post for chemical or nuclear war and had enough supplies to last 130 occupants up to a year
