by @entity0 published : 04:21 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 06:43 est , 20 september 2013 a fit and seemingly healthy father - of - three collapsed and died from a sudden cardiac arrest just days after celebrating his tenth wedding anniversary			1
@entity4 , 41 , died while out running during his lunch break			2
he had never previously had any problems with his heart and regularly took part in triathlons			2
@entity4 ( pictured with his daughter , @entity10 , nine ) collapsed and died of a cardiac arrest while out running			1
he was 41 - years - old and had just celebrated his tenth wedding anniversary with wife , @entity12 in august last year , mr @entity4 , from @entity13 , returned home early from a family holiday in @entity16 as he had to go back to work as a software engineer			1
his wife , @entity19 , 40 , remained in @entity16 with their children , @entity22 , 11 , @entity10 , nine , and @entity23 , seven , for a few more days			2
the day after mr @entity4 returned to work , mrs @entity19 received a call from his mother at 4pm to say that she had been contacted by his colleagues because he had not returned from his three mile lunchtime run			2
mrs @entity19 said : ‘ then i had another call to say he was in the hospital			0
‘ obviously i was concerned but cardiac arrest was the last thing on my mind , i just thought he would have fallen over and hurt himself or something like that			1
‘ it was really frustrating and i started to get quite worried because i was finding it so hard to get answers and we were so far away			0
' when mr @entity4 ( pictured with his wife ) collapsed , a passerby gave him cpr until an ambulance arrived			1
paramedics fought to save him but they were unable to restart his heart mrs @entity19 called the hospital repeatedly in an attempt to find out what was going on but no one was able to tell her anything as mr @entity4 had not yet been identified			1
she only learned what had happened after a colleague of his went to the hospital to identify him			0
she said ‘ then the final call was from a police officer at 7pm			0
‘ he told me @entity4 had collapsed and that despite efforts to revive him he had n’t made it			2
my reaction was just one of total disbelief			0
’ contrary to popular belief , a cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack			1
a cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating due to a malfunction in its electrical system			1
it is caused by an abnormal rhythm , or arrhythmia			0
anyone can suffer a cardiac arrest and it can happen at any time and without warning			1
symptoms include unresponsiveness , loss of consciousness , lack of pulse and stopping breathing			0
in contrast , a heart attack can be thought of as a problem with the heart 's plumbing - it occurs when an artery supplying the heart becomes blocked			2
this causes the heart muscle to begin to die slowly while the patient usually remains awake and alert			2
she told @entity91 : ' i still ca n't believe that someone with no medical conditions can have a cardiac arrest like that			1
' when mr @entity4 collapsed a bystander tried to save him by administering cpr while an ambulance was called			1
when paramedics arrived , they fought to keep him alive but they were unable to restart his heart			1
mrs @entity19 said : ‘ i did n’t know what to do at first , i just felt completely helpless			0
‘ we were all still in @entity16 , seven hours away from @entity13 , so we had to get in the car and come all the way back knowing that			0
‘ i did n’t know whether to tell the children first or wait until we got to the hospital , it was just horrendous			2
’ mrs @entity19 added : ‘ @entity4 had never had any problems with his heart and he was such a fit man			1
‘ he always used to joke about how he never needed to go to the doctor			0
‘ he used to take part in triathlons - he really was the last person you would have expected this to happen to			0
' after mr @entity4 ' death , a post-mortem examination revealed that he had died of a cardiac arrest - he had no undiagnosed heart defect			1
since mr @entity4 ’ death , mrs @entity19 has campaigned to have a defibrillator fitted in the family ’s home village of @entity126 , in @entity13			1
a defibrillator does not guarantee the survival of a person who has gone into cardiac arrest but it increases their chance of survival from nine per cent to 50 per cent if it is used within four minutes of the cardiac arrest occurring			1
after four minutes , the person will have suffered brain damage caused by oxygen starvation			0
a post-mortem examination revealed that mr @entity4 ( pictured with his children @entity23 , left , @entity10 , centre , and @entity22 , right ) died of a cardiac arrest			1
a cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating as a result of a malfunction in its electrical system the machine is fully automated meaning that no training is required to operate it - once the ' start ' button is pressed , the machine talks the user through what to do			1
it measures the patient 's heart rhythm before administering a shock and will not shock them if their heart rhythm is normal			2
it is placed in a publicly accessible cabinet which can be opened with a key code - this code can be given out by 999 call handlers			0
mrs @entity19 has raised the money as part of the @entity170 ’s @entity168 and @entity169 campaign which is fronted by @entity171 , the @entity172 footballer who suffered a cardiac arrest on the pitch last year			1
mrs @entity19 said : ‘ the defibrillator is a legacy for @entity4			1
he was the kind of person who always got involved in good causes and would have liked the idea that he could make a difference			0
mr @entity4 ' children ( pictured ) and wife have raised enough money to have a defibrillator placed in their village in @entity13			1
they are now campaigning for them to be distributed more widely ‘ i suppose there will always be that doubt that a defibrillator could have saved @entity4 but we will never know for sure			1
‘ these devices do increase the chance of someone surviving so dramatically that we wanted to make sure our village was protected in his name			0
‘ we hope it never needs to be used but if it ever did it could save somebody ’s life			0
an automated external defibrillator ( @entity201 ) is a life - saving device for use in the event of a cardiac arrest			1
it is a portable device that analyses heart rhythm and administers an electrical charge to the heart if needed			0
the user does not need to have any training as the @entity201 will give spoken instructions when it is activated			0
it will tell the user to connect the pads to the patient 's bare chest			0
the device will then measure the patient 's heart rhythm and will charge in preparation to deliver a shock if necessary			0
it will then instruct the user to ensure no one is touching the patient and to press a button to deliver the shock			0
once this has been done , it will instruct the user to give cpr for two minutes after which it will analyse the patient 's heart rhythm again before advising on whether to give a further shock or more cpr			2
using a defibrillator increases a cardiac arrest patient 's chance of survival from about nine per cent to 50 per cent			1
‘ it has provided a real focus for the children as well			0
it means they can remember their father in a positive way and his name is attached with something positive and allows us to try to move on as a family			0
‘ i ca n’t think of a better tribute for @entity4			2
’ @entity251 , founder and ceo of @entity170 , said : ‘ to see people take the lead on this is great - it provides a superb example to other communities			0
‘ because @entity12 and the rest of the village know only too well the consequences of sudden cardiac they have pursued this with great enthusiasm			2
‘ that is clear to see in the energy and commitment they have shown in pulling the project together so quickly			0
‘ they have turned a terrible tragedy into something positive			0
‘ automated external defibrillators dramatically increase the chance of a person surviving in the event of them suffering a sudden cardiac arrest			1
‘ sudden cardiac arrest can strike anyone at any time and is the @entity283 's biggest killer , causing 100,000 deaths every year			1
every community should have public - access @entity286 available 24/7 ready in cases of emergency			0
‘ @entity126 is now a safer place thanks to the work of @entity12 and all of those who helped bring this together			0
i can not think of a better legacy for @entity4			2
