by @entity0 for @entity1 passengers on @entity4 and @entity5 flights will now be able to use electronic devices on flight during takeoff and landing passengers on @entity4 and @entity12 aircraft will be able to use electronic devices during flights , including during take - off and landing			1
the new policy will allow passengers to use smart phones , tablets , and mp3 players throughout plane journeys and on the tarmac as long as they are in flight mode			1
larger items such as laptops will be able to be used during flights , though will have to be stored during take - off and landing and passengers will still not be able to make calls or send text messages from the air			2
the new policy was approved by the @entity33 on monday and comes into effect on tuesday at 3pm			2
@entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 currently have submissions before @entity33 to allow them to introduce the policy to their airlines			2
' basically we put a set of procedures in place and the airlines had to demonstrate two things			0
they had to demonstrate their aircrafts wo n’t be susceptible to electro - magnetic interference , ' @entity46 from the @entity33 told @entity1			0
' the second thing was cabin safety			0
the airline had to have in place appropriate procedures , things like , big devices like laptops still have to be stowed due to risk of injury … ensuring cords do n’t hinder people , common sense sort of stuff			0
' when asked about instructions offered to plane passengers that they must turn off their electronic devices because they might interfere with a plane ’s navigational equipment , mr @entity46 said : ' modern aircraft have been examined for this and the risk of interference is very , very low			2
' prior to this ruling , passengers have been required to keep their devices switched off until the seatbelt sign was turned off , meaning passengers could not use their devices while aircrafts were taxiing , as well as through much of the climb or descent			0
people will be able to use laptops , e-readers , tablets and smart phones , though they are still not able to make phone calls or send text messages the change to the policy follows a ruling last october by the @entity95 ' @entity94 that allowed passengers flying in the @entity95 to leave their electronic devices on through all stages of a flight , if individual airlines could prove it did not interfere with the operation of the aircraft			1
since the ruling , experts from various airlines have been investigating the impact of personal electronic devices inflight the changes mean passengers will be able to use smartphones and tablets weighing up to one kilogram in flight mode during take - off , landing and taxi mode			1
heavier items such as laptops will still be required to be held in overhead departments with fear they could be a danger to other passengers during high turbulence if they become air - borne			0
training for cabin crews will also have to be revised with necessity placed on ensuring passengers still pay attention to flight announcements @entity12 released a statement on friday from the chief customer officer @entity128 which claimed that the airline company had already re-lodged their submission and were waiting for approval ' in - flight entertainment is a key driver of customer satisfaction and this application marks the next phase of that product evolution , ' mr @entity128 said			0
' @entity12 will work to immediately implement the use of hand - held personal electronic devices from gate to gate and will have further updates for customers in coming days			1
' @entity12 and @entity4 have had their submissions to @entity33 approved			1

passengers can now use electronic devices on @entity12 and @entity4 flights
new policy has been approved by the @entity33
passengers can use smart phones , tablets , laptops and music players
items weighing more than *1kg* , including laptops , would still need to be stowed away in *ovewrhead* *compartments* for safety reasons
