mention the @entity0 to most music lovers , and they will call to mind the orchestral strains of @entity3 and @entity4			1
but it seems the @entity6 has now decided to stretch the definition of classical music … to include the @entity9 and the @entity11 theme tune			1
the corporation has come under fire for further ‘ dumbing down ’ the annual festival by booking a string of pop acts in a bid to attract younger audiences			1
the @entity6 has come under fire for further ' dumbing down ' the @entity0 by booking a string of pop acts last year ’s schedule was criticised for including two rappers and a punk band , and it seems this year the programme has strayed even further from its traditional remit			1
it will include concerts by 32 - year - old pop singer @entity29 – whose music is normally played on @entity31 – and @entity33 rock star @entity32			1
one of the highlights of the summer schedule will be electronic pop duo @entity36 and @entity37 who form the @entity9			1
the pair – who have won three @entity40 - are best known for 80s dance hits			1
but their latest outing will see them perform a new work based on the life of codebreaker @entity47 alongside the @entity48 and the @entity49			1
other proms will include one based entirely on sport			2
hosted by presenter @entity53 , 41 , it will feature well known tunes such as the themes from @entity11 and @entity56			1
and there will two concerts aimed at pre-school children with @entity60 characters set to introduce snippets of classical music designed to appeal to the under - fives			1
this year 's festival will include concerts by 32 - year - old pop singer @entity29 and 80s duo the @entity9 last night , veteran art critic @entity66 , 82 , accused the @entity6 of taking the @entity0 further downmarket			1
he said : ‘ this is tragic			2
i ca n’t think of any other word for it			2
classical music may need to draw in the younger generations , but i ’m not sure having the @entity9 is going to do the trick			2
‘ you will end up with very successful @entity9 concert , but it does n’t mean the audience is going to come back to listen to @entity4 or @entity77			2
‘ dumbing - down just does n’t work , and i should have thought the bloody minded @entity6 would have worked that out by now			2
they always have to back - track because they begin to lose their core audience			2
’ ‘ the most successful prom i ever witnessed was a night devoted entirely to @entity83			2
it was pure , unadulterated punishment for me			2
' i do not suppose for one moment that the people sitting there will ever go again to a prom concert			0
they went because it was @entity83 and will not be seduced into watching @entity4			0
two concerts will feature @entity60 characters designed to appeal to listeners under the age of five mr @entity66 added : ‘ i would rather a @entity0 that was true to itself but which sold fewer tickets			1
the size of the concert is unimportant			0
‘ the actual experience of going to the @entity103 for a concert is deeply unpleasant			0
it is hot , the acoustics are not nearly as good as they ought to be , and if you want a glass of water or a sticky bun it costs you a small fortune			0
it is not a great experience in itself			0
‘ so there is no point getting more people through the door unless they are genuinely interested in classical music			0
’ other star performers at this year ’s @entity0 – which run from july 18 to september 13 – are the puppets from @entity122 theatre hit @entity123 , which will star alongside a @entity125 assembled by @entity126			1
the season will feature orchestras from dozens of countries , including @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			1
several prominent @entity135 conductors will mark their birthdays with performances , including sir @entity138 , who turned 90 last week , conducting his first prom since 1997			1
it is not the first time the @entity0 have been accused of dumbing down in a bid to be inclusive			0
last year ’s schedule featured rappers @entity145 and @entity146 , punk veterans @entity148			1
other years have featured a @entity149 and a @entity153 , while the 2007 festival was criticised for having a show - tunes evening with @entity152			1
proms director , and radio 3 controller , @entity156 – who is stepping down this summer - defended the schedule yesterday			0
he said : ‘ we should put it in context			0
they are just a few out of 90 - plus events			0
this is about introducing new people to the @entity0 and the notion this is something brand new is totally wrong			0
‘ we want people to feel connected to the @entity0			0
it is about making sure they are there , they have a good time , they know howto get in , where to queue , how to pay			0
‘ all of those things are a key part of opening it up			0
we have anecdotal evidence that they come again			0
they start to put their feet very gently in other more popular elements of the programme			0
‘ you ca n’t just sit there in the @entity103 or @entity182 and simply expect audiences who have no experience of this music to find you			0

last year corporation *blasted* for rap and punk performances
@entity29 and the @entity192 will play at this year 's festival
two concerts will feature @entity60 characters for listeners under five
