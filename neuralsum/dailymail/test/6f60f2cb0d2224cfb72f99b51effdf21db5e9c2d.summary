the @entity1 filled more than half its election tv debate audience with left - leaning voters , some of whom were brought in from @entity6 and @entity7 , it emerged last night			1
the audience at the filming of thursday night ’s debate in @entity11 repeatedly cheered calls for more public spending and strong defences of immigration			1
when @entity18 leader @entity17 interjected and said they were prejudiced , ‘ even by the left - wing standards of the @entity1 ’ , the audience only booed him further			1
the @entity1 initially refused to disclose the political make - up of the audience but eventually released figures late yesterday			2
of the 200 - strong audience , about 58 were conservative or @entity18 supporters while about 102 backed left - leaning parties – @entity27 , the @entity41 , @entity29 , @entity31 or the @entity29			2
the rest – 40 – described themselves as undecided			0
the figures mean just 36 per cent of the audience members with a declared political allegiance were supporters of the @entity48 or @entity18			0
but the latest @entity34 poll for the @entity50 put the @entity48 on 39 per cent and @entity18 on 7 per cent – a total of 46 per cent overall			1
last night mr @entity17 said : ‘ if the audience make - up did n’t reflect that then it ’s wrong			2
’ out in the cold : @entity18 leader @entity17 cuts a isolated figure at the end of the @entity60 debate on thursday the @entity1 told @entity34 to make sure a fifth were so - called floating voters , and for every five @entity27 supporters in the room , it made sure there were five for the @entity65 , four for the @entity41 , two for the @entity29 , two for the @entity66 and one for @entity31			1
the figures suggest supporters of the @entity48 and @entity18 were significantly under - represented			0
@entity34 admitted that it recruited almost all of its audience members @entity70			0
the company said in a statement that it identified ‘ 30 small geographical areas ’ within a 20 - mile radius of the @entity11 debate hall and found at least eight people from each one			0
it also selected a ‘ small number ’ of @entity29 and @entity31 from @entity6 and @entity7 using an undisclosed method ‘ reasonably decided upon by @entity34 ’			1
the company refused to answer any other questions about the matter			0
yesterday the @entity1 refused to disclose how many people had complained about its broadcast			0
‘ our data shows the number of audience contacts were heavily influenced by the issue being raised during the debate and therefore we wo n’t be giving out figures , ’ a @entity1 spokesman said			1
conservative mp @entity94 said : ‘ the audience should reflect the opinion polls and the fact is that nearly half of the country say they would vote conservative of @entity18 , ’ ‘ you have to ask yourself what would have happened if the audience had been right of centre			1
the left would have had a field day			0
they would have been so holier - than - thou			0
’ @entity41 , @entity41 mp for @entity110 , said the @entity1 ’s behaviour was ‘ ludicrous ’ and its refusal to publish the number of complaints ‘ added insult to injury ’			2
the contest saw @entity27 's @entity118 , @entity29 's @entity119 , @entity18 's @entity17 , @entity28 's @entity120 and @entity31 's @entity121 go head - to - head			2

they cheered calls for more public spending and defences of immigration
when @entity18 leader @entity17 said they were prejudiced , he was booed
host @entity25 pointed out that audience *wad* *n't* selected by the @entity1
but by a ‘ reputable polling organisation ’ , later to be revealed to be @entity34
