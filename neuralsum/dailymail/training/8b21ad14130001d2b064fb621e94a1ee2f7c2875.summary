by @entity0 published : 11:09 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 11:17 est , 24 june 2013 there can be few offices in the world which could be worse places to work			0
but spending much of his professional life wading waist - deep in unimaginably foul - smelling sewage water is all in a day 's work for @entity8			1
the hardy 64 - year - old is chief flusher for @entity12 's sewage network , whose role is the spend days surrounded by rats and vomit - inducing smells as he clears blockages of congealed lard and faeces			1
tough day at the office : @entity8 is in contention of the prize of having worst job in @entity23 - hacking out man - size ' fatbergs ' from @entity12 's sewers and despite what you 'd imagine , he believes he has the best job in @entity23 - hacking out huge ‘ fatbergs ’ from the clogged waterways			1
but @entity8 , who has been in the job for an incredible 20 years , has grown to love his smelly livelihood			1
he said : ' at the end of the day , someone ’s go to do it			0
why not take pride in it ? ' ' i ’m very proud to be a sewer man			0
' to maintain his social life - and relationship with his wife and family - he makes sure to shower regularly and ‘ avoid people with sensitive noses ’			2
disgusting : @entity8 has called the dank sewers under @entity12 his office for the past 20 years craned in : @entity8 is lowered into the sewers under the streets of @entity12 to begin his shift shoveling ' fatbergs ' going down : @entity8 , chief flusher for @entity12 's sewage network , heads for the disgusting depths of the sewer under @entity56 his travels through the ageing @entity59 network has seen him come across everything from half a @entity61 to a live hand - grenade			1
the biggest ‘ fatberg ’ he has encountered was found near @entity63			0
it was the size of a man and took two days to break down			0
for one week a month he is on call 24 - hours a day and if a blockage occurs he must drop everything and enter the sewer			2
he says the network smells different depending on what time you go in and can sometimes smell ‘ nice ’			2
disgusting : @entity8 gets kitted up , left , as he prepares to venture into the dank sewers under @entity12 strong stomach : @entity8 must have developed quite a strong stomach having spent the past 20 years working in the sewers ' in a normal sewer the smell changes during the course of the day			1
if you go into most sewers during the early hours of the morning , predominately it ’s bath water , shower water and it ’s quite fragrant			0
' that , of course , lessens during the course of the day and then you get the same thing in the evening when people are getting ready to go out			0
' despite all the high - tech equipment available , @entity8 maintains his ultimate safety weapon is his sensitive nose			1
dirty work : @entity8 has performed the vital job of trying to keep @entity12 's sewers clear of blockages @entity8 , from @entity96 , @entity97 , said : ' we have to be very aware of our sense of smell			1
if i have a cold and i ca n’t smell then , strictly speaking , i should n’t go into a confined space because smell is a key component of keeping yourself safe			0
' the monitors will pick up most things but your smell and your hearing tells you the other bits that you need to be 100 per cent safe			0
' @entity110 is planning to combat the threat of ‘ fatbergs ’ by taking fat and oils directly from restaurants and build - ups in drains to power @entity23 ’s biggest sewage works			2
hard day 's work : @entity8 , 64 , emerges from the depth after carrying out what has to be one of the most unpleasant jobs in the country the grease will be fed into what will be the world ’s largest fat - fuelled power station at @entity131 in east @entity12			1
the plant will be able to produce 130 gigawatt hours a year of renewable electricity - enough to run 39,000 average - sized homes			2
@entity135 , commercial director for @entity110 , said : ' this project is a win - win : renewable power , hedged from the price fluctuations of the non-renewable mainstream power markets , and helping tackle the ongoing operational problem of ‘ fatbergs ’ in sewers			0

@entity8 is chief flusher for @entity12 's sewage network
the 64 - year - old , from @entity96 , @entity97 , clears blockages from drains
