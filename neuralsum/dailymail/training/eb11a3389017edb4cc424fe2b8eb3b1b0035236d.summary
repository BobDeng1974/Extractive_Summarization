by @entity0 for @entity1 a teenage girl is so terrified of hair that she is unable to lead a normal life - with the very sight of it making her feel nauseous , nervous and tearful			1
sixth form student @entity8 , 17 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , has seen relationships with boys ruined over the irrational phobia which prevents her from straying too close to people 's heads			1
only recently has she managed to touch her own locks without feeling sick and doctors say the only way to cure the bizarre fear , known as @entity21 , is to face it head on			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , can not go near hair without wanting to be sick and crying @entity8 said : ' i just hate the texture of hair			1
there 's something about it that makes me feel nauseous and nervous			0
thick , curly hair or wet hair is the worst of all			1
' my own hair used to make me feel sick too , i hate the feel of it on me			1
until about a year ago , i was not even able to touch it without getting scared			0
' with a push , i will now put my fingers through my hair or stroke it			1
' my mum makes me cut my hair twice a year and the experience is horrible			1
i despise it so much , especially when i can see my locks all over the floor			0
' the 17 - year - old says the condition , known as @entity21 , is ruining her life ( above her mother , @entity51 , attempts to comb her locks ) @entity8 's worst ordeal saw her break into tears after encountering some tresses in a public toilet she explains : ' i was at a @entity59 football match and went to the loo			1
i saw a clump of hair in the sink and i screamed in front of everyone and started crying			1
' i ran back to my seat in tears and everyone in the stadium was staring at me			0
my dad did n't know what to do			0
i just sobbed the whole way through the match			1
' @entity8 's mother , @entity74 , 42 , says that she has suffered from the condition since she was a child			1
finance assistant , @entity51 said : ' @entity8 's had her phobia for as long as i can remember			1
i do n't know how it started			0
@entity8 says she can not go on dates with boys with hair while her mother says she has suffered from the rare condition since she was a child ' she used to take baths with her sister and as soon as @entity8 spotted a hair in the bath , she 'd be climbing out			1
' her phobia just progressed from there really			0
any natural hair scares the hell out of her			1
@entity8 claims the fear developed when she joined secondary school and says when classmated accidentally touched her hair she wwould want to throw up			1
the word chaetophobia comes from the @entity96 word ' khaite ' meaning ‘ loose , flowing hair ’			1
sufferers dont only fear other people 's hair but their own as well			1
experts believe the fear can result from a traumatic experience such as having a really bad haircut as a child and being ridiculed for it			1
another cause can be explained by post traumatic stress after getting head lice as sufferers will fear further infestations			2
people with this phobia often try to shave off all of their hair , or have really short hair			2
psychotherapy has been known to cure the condition but medication may be needed in the very isolated cases that render the phobic person dysfunctional in society			0
the 17 - year - old is single and says makes dating a nightmare			2
' when i first meet a boy , i find their hair really scary			2
i wo n't go near it			0
i do n't know what their hair could be like			2
' it 's so embarrassing having to eventually reveal to a guy i 'm dating that i have a phobia of hair			2
i try to say it on the third date so i can get the awkwardness out of the way			0
' it took me about six months to be able to even go near my ex-boyfriend 's hair			2
to be honest , i 'd prefer to go out with a guy who has a shaved head instead			2
at least their locks would n't be near me and i would n't find loose clumps of it around the floor			0
' @entity8 - who has two sisters @entity148 , 18 and @entity149 , 12 - says she is constantly mocked by her friends and family who think her phobia is amusing			1
she explains : ' my friends always tease me			0
they take hair from their own head and put it on my back when i 'm not looking			2
if there 's a clump of hair lying on the floor , they wo n't pick it up and i ca n't move anywhere			2
' once my friend dropped some on me and i froze			0
i was so scared that i could n't move for about ten minutes			0
my friends were eventually forced to take it off me			0
' my younger sister , @entity149 , teases me too			0
she chases me around the house with hairbrushes and puts hair in my face			2
i have a go at her and tell her to leave me alone but she never stops			0
' despite the daily afflictions of her phobia , she has never sought medical help			0
' i 've never considered going to a gp about my problem because it seems silly			0
when i was younger , i would have liked to have talked to someone about my phobia though			0
' a spokesperson for @entity183 , the phobia charity said : ' @entity8 needs to have a course of exposure therapy to help her overcome her fear of hair			1
' she will only recover if she faces her fear and she can do this by taking little steps each day			0
