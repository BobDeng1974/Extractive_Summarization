a @entity1 space plane , shrouded in secrecy , has broken its own longevity record by staying in orbit for more than 469 days			1
the flight is the third for the @entity8 mystery mission and was launched on december 11 , 2012 , atop an @entity10 rocket at @entity11			1
@entity12 is known about the spacecraft , which is taken into orbit on a rocket but lands like the space shuttle by gliding down to @entity16			1
a @entity1 space plane , shrouded in secrecy , has broken its own longevity record by staying in orbit for more than 469 days the mission 's first orbital launch , @entity1 - 212 , took place on 22 april 2010			1
a second @entity8 was launched on 5 march 2011 and returned to @entity16 on 16 june 2012			1
up until now , the record for the longest @entity8 mission is 469 days , set by the program 's second mission launched in 2011			1
mystery surrounds the exact type and capabilities of the hardware aboard with some analysts suggesting it will be used to support @entity1 soldiers in various warzones around the world			1
the @entity35 's unmanned @entity8 space plane has flown three secret missions to date			0
each time it has carried a mystery payload on long - duration flights in @entity16 orbit			1
the spacecraft looks similar to @entity43 's space shuttle but is much smaller			2
the @entity8 is about 29 feet ( 8.8m ) long and 9.5 feet ( 2.9 m ) tall			0
it has a wingspan just less than 15 feet ( 4.6 m )			0
at launch , it weighs 11,000 lbs ( 4,990 kg )			0
the craft is taken into orbit on a rocket but lands like the space shuttle by gliding down to @entity16			1
astrophysicist @entity50 told @entity51 it seems clear one of the big features is the plane ’s ability to stay in space for extended periods of time			0
‘ the @entity35 now has a policy of acquiring capabilities rather than missions , so some general somewhere probably thinks it would be spiffy to have a space plane that can launch at short notice , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s worthwhile learning lessons from the shuttle and how to do turn - arounds cheaper			0
’ ahead of the @entity8 ’s first launch , officials said the craft would conduct experiments involving the transport of satellite sensors , subsystems , components , and associated technology into space			2
‘ i believe it ’s testing some kind of experimental sensor for the @entity81 ; for example , a hyper spectral imager , or some new kind of signals intelligence package , ’ mr @entity50 said to @entity51			0
‘ the sensor was more successful than expected , so the payload customer asked the @entity8 folks to keep the spacecraft in orbit longer			2
’ personnel are shown here inspecting the @entity8 , the @entity35 's first unmanned re-entry spacecraft , after landing on december 3 , 2010 at @entity93 in @entity94 there are rumours circulating that the craft has been kept in space to spy on the new @entity100 space station , @entity101			1
however , analysts have pointed out that surveillance would be tricky , since the spacecraft would rush past each other at thousands of metres per second			2
in may 2011 , amateur astronomers were able to detect the orbital pattern of the first @entity8 which included flyovers of @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 , heightening the suspicion that the vehicle was being used for surveillance			0
other industry analysts have speculated that the @entity35 is just making use of the @entity8 ’s amazing fuel efficiency and keeping it in space for as long as possible to show off its credentials and protect it from budget cuts			2
this april 5 , 2010 photo made available by the @entity35 shows the @entity125 at the @entity127 facility in @entity129 @entity128 - this was the vehicle 's second launch a @entity134 rocket , carrying an @entity8 experimental robotic space plane , lifts off from launch complex 41 at the @entity11 in 2012			0

spacecraft taken into orbit on a rocket but lands by gliding down to @entity16
is the third and longest flight for mission which is shrouded in secrecy
some analysts suggest it will help support @entity1 soldiers in warzones
other rumours are circulating that the craft has been kept in space to spy on the new @entity100 space station , @entity101
