by @entity0 published : 12:03 est , 4 september 2012 updated : 13:05 est , 4 september 2012 though trains have wavered in and out of fashion over the past few decades , a bold plan seeks to relieve train traffic on the ever - crowed @entity5 by building a new route – under the @entity7			1
bullet trains would race between @entity9 and @entity10 and pass under the @entity12 estuary in an 18 - mile underwater tunnel			2
but the construction would not come cheaply , at an estimated $ 151billion			1
students estimated the entire construction would cost around $ 100billion , with $ 20billion dedicated to the new segment connecting @entity43 and @entity47 , @entity32			1
similarly , @entity17 ’s plan , which was released in july , is for a $ 151billion expansion			1
in either proposal , finances are a major concern			0
the rail company would need significant public and private funding to get the project on track			0
speaking with the @entity59 this summer , @entity17 president and ceo @entity57 said : ‘ we can worry about where the money is coming from , but we need to have a plan in place so when it does , we ’re ready			2
’ the students write in their proposition , entitled ‘ making high - speed rail work the @entity68 , ’ that the new high - speed rail tracks could cut existing travel times in half , making a commute between @entity43 and @entity10 only one hour and 45 minutes			1
current route : @entity17 's @entity19 service passes from @entity10 to @entity43 in less than three hours , but with the proposed route , that time would be just over an hour a commute between @entity43 and @entity9 would be a little over three hours			2
as the @entity80 notes , the proposed plans has ‘ at least a bit of bipartisan appeal , ’ mentioning that faster train service along the @entity5 would allow hundreds of thousands of passengers to travel more quickly and cheaply from city to city			2
in fact , by 2040 , ridership is expected to reach a staggering 43.5million annual riders			0
many high - speed rail propositions made by president @entity91 and vice president @entity92 have been touted by conservatives in @entity94 that the plan was too costly			1
members of the @entity97 said in 2011 after they turned down the president ’s $ 8billion bill that the busy @entity5 was where the future of high - speed trains lay			1
last year alone , @entity17 transported 11million passengers along the corridor			2
commuter network : more and more people along the @entity41 are relying on fast trains ; here , travellers are seen in @entity42 's @entity109 @entity110 plans : @entity17 plans a $ 7billion expansion of @entity10 's @entity112 , pictured , with the goal of making it a high - speed rail and commercial hub train spotting : people walk in front of the @entity17 departure board at @entity43 's @entity121 ; train service from @entity10 to @entity43 would be cut in half by the new bullet trains the feat to build an 18 - mile tunnel under the @entity7 , while certainly an ambitious undertaking , does not make it the longest underwater tunnel			1
that title belongs to the @entity130 , which runs 31.4 miles under the @entity131			0
likewise , the @entity132 in @entity133 , which runs 33.5 miles , with a 14.5 - mile segment under the sea bed , holds the record for the longest stretch of underground tunnel			0
the @entity139 has launched an intensive study on the corridor , examining the current route from @entity10 to @entity9			0
included in its study are the metropolitan regions around @entity10 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity148 , @entity149 , and @entity9			0
the bullet trains , much like those in @entity152 and @entity153 , could skyrocket across tracks at speeds up to 220mph			0
record holder : the @entity130 holds the record for longest underwater tunnel at 31.4 miles of track a @entity160 for the @entity161 : early actions for @entity163 from @entity164 on @entity165 .			0

both @entity17 and design students at @entity25 proposed plan routing high - speed train under @entity7
plan would cost an estimated $ 151billion
