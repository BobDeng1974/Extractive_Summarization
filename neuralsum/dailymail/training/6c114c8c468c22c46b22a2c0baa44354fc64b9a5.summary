by @entity0 published : 11:03 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 13:59 est , 24 september 2013 he might not be fluffy or have big eyes - but he is arguably one of the cutest animals around			2
covered in scales with huge claws , a protruding nose and a long tongue , this pangolin should n't be so sweet - but the mammal ca n't help but melt hearts with his shy gaze and tiny body			2
clutching his hands together , this orphaned baby has won over his surrogate mother - and is sure to win an army of fans with his cute looks			1
and this little creature is being cared for by his human ' adoptive mother ' , who initially cared for the mammal 's birth mother , @entity45 , when she was found on the black market			1
@entity47 gave birth to the little pangolin during her stay at the organisation and the unnamed baby is now being hand - reared by @entity53			1
the 48 - year - old feeds him a diet of milk , yoghurt and ants and often lets him sit on her head as in the wild the young often ride on their mother 's back			1
@entity29 , from @entity65 , who runs conservation group @entity67 and @entity68 ( @entity69 ) , said : ' @entity45 was wild but was caught and taken around a local town in boxes , to be sold on the black market			0
@entity29 has been feeding the baby on a diet of milk , yoghurt and ants since he was abandoned by his mother the curious creature joins a list of unusual photo - bombers including alpacas , great white sharks and sloths ' a shop owner felt sorry for her and bought her and we ended up taking her in			1
' we hoped we could hold her for a few days until we could get a tracker on her before releasing her			0
' but four days after receiving her she crawled slowly to me and sat in my lap and i soon realised that she had given birth			0
' about three months later @entity45 began begging to be let out			0
' because she had always returned previously , i let her out			0
she headed up a mountain and sadly that is the last time i saw her			0
' after many sleepless nights , the baby started responding well to plain yoghurt , special animal milk formula and his twice daily ant forages			1
' and the creature might be tiny , but he 's clearly got a big sense of humour - even clambering up on his surrogate mother 's head to photobomb her pictures			1
this baby pangolin , who is unnamed , has a 10 inch long tongue whihc could extend up to 27 inches when he is a fully grown adult @entity29 has been caring for the baby since his mother @entity47 abandoned him while only a few days old ' his favourite place was just behind her neck and that is why i believe he still loves to crawl onto the top of my head as i walk around			1
thus , i always wear a hat , ' @entity29 said			0
' the photos that i took with my @entity117 shows his tongue which is about a long as his body			0
' the ground pangolin - @entity23 in @entity24 - are endangered and rare to find because they are difficult to spot			1
they are covered in hard scales made from keratin , are nocturnal , and sleep curled up into a ball			0
they have extremely long , sticky tongues that start in the abdomen and are used to delve into insect mounds to collect prey			0
the baby pangolin @entity29 is caring for has will be named following a fundraising competition			2
for the moment he is just known as ' baby ' .			2

the baby has been looked after since his mother @entity47 abandoned him
his name will be chosen at *random* from donors ' *suggestions*
pangolins are one of the world 's most endangered mammals
