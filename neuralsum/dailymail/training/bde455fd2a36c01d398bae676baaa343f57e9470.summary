writer @entity0 was taken ill with stomach pains which resulted in his appendix ' exploding ' thriller writer @entity0 prided himself on being fit and healthy , so when he developed stomach ache after eating cherries earlier this summer , he assumed he 'd just over-indulged			1
yet rather than getting any better , over the next day the pain intensified			1
' it was all over my stomach , ' recalls @entity0 , 48 , a divorced father - of - two from @entity11 , @entity12			1
' i do a lot of @entity15 cookery so i thought the king prawns i 'd had earlier that day might be to blame			1
@entity17 just scared me as it suggested bowel cancer , crohn 's disease , irritable bowel syndrome or appendicitis			0
' i ruled out appendicitis as my brother @entity23 had appendicitis when he was six , and i knew his scar was low down on the right side of his stomach			1
my pain was from under my ribcage to below my navel			1
' in fact , he did have appendicitis - and within five days of the first symptoms , his appendix had burst and he was undergoing emergency surgery			1
but in the meantime , oblivious to this , he took some paracetamol			0
that night he slept fitfully and the next day , he went to his gp			2
she felt the lower right part of his abdomen to check for appendicitis			0
yet because @entity0 did n't feel any discomfort there , she concluded he had a stomach virus and prescribed painkillers			1
although the pain had gone by the next day , @entity0 still felt unwell			1
' i 'd no energy at all , but assumed my strength was going into fighting my stomach bug			1
i can walk 25 miles - i enjoy the odd long trek - but that day i could n't walk 25 yards , ' he says			2
by day five , the pain had returned , this time on the right side of his abdomen , and was so intense @entity0 was bent double			1
' i could n't sleep on my right side , and when i got up that morning , i was on my knees in unbearable pain			2
i rang my dad , @entity60 , who lives nearby , to take me to the hospital seven miles away			0
just getting into his car had me screaming in pain			2
when we arrived at the hospital i staggered in , holding on to the wall for support			0
' an immediate scan revealed the cause of @entity0 's pain			1
' one side of my appendix had literally been blown away because of the extent of the infection , ' he says			2
' a doctor said my insides were like a war zone			0
my appendix was behind my large bowel , which is why i did n't feel any tenderness when my gp examined me initially			2
' appendicitis is common - around 7 per cent of people will experience it , typically between the ages of ten to 20 , although why it should be more common at this age is not clear			0
but older people can develop it , too			0
the appendix - a narrow , finger - like pouch between 5cm and 10cm long - is attached to the beginning of the large intestine on the right side of the abdomen			2
but because of its length , the tip can lie in different positions , in the pelvis , in front of the bowel or , as @entity0 's was , behind the bowel			1
he underwent keyhole surgery to remove the infection so although people often think severe stomach ache can only be appendicitis if it 's on the right side of the abdomen , most patients , like @entity0 , find the pain starts in the centre			1
and some people wo n't have stomach ache at all			1
' a young child with appendicitis may have no pain , but might have a fever or be short of breath and looking poorly , ' explains @entity117 , a general surgery consultant at @entity118 under five are often much more difficult to diagnose because of their limited communication skills , adds @entity119 , a colorectal and laparoscopic surgeon at the @entity120 and @entity121 in @entity122 , @entity123			1
' a lot of appendicitis cases in children are misdiagnosed as gastroenteritis or a virus , ' says mr @entity119			0
' adults with appendicitis may have one or more other symptoms , such as nausea , vomiting , loss of appetite , diarrhoea and a high temperature			0
' as symptoms can vary it can easily be confused with other conditions			0
in up to 30 per cent of cases involving women , the diagnosis is wrong and a normal appendix may be removed , when in fact the pain has been caused by ovarian cysts , a pelvic infection or a urine infection			1
' appendicitis begins as a result of a blockage at its entrance most commonly caused by a hard piece of stool ( a faecolith ) , which can be between 5mm and 10mm			0
with children or adolescents , it can occur a week or so after a viral infection			0
as mr @entity119 explains : ' this is because the appendix is a lymphoid organ - a structure that drains infection from other parts of the body			2
the lymph follicles in the appendix can swell up so much during a virus infection that they block it			2
' once the appendix is blocked , bacteria inside it start multiplying and it becomes inflamed			2
as well as pain this can lead to the other symptoms , including diarrhoea and a high temperature			2
the best treatment for appendicitis is to remove the appendix , suggests mr @entity119			2
' sometimes people are given antibiotics if their pain settles down , but 20 per cent of these will have a recurrence of the symptoms			2
' an appendicectomy - removal of the appendix - is the most common emergency abdominal surgery in the @entity191			1
most are carried out by keyhole surgery			2
yet if diagnosis is delayed , the appendix can continue to swell , and in a fifth of cases goes on to burst , releasing bacteria , which can spread to the peritoneum , the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the abdomen , causing inflammation , or peritonitis			2
this is potentially fatal , as the infection can then spread to major organs , causing organ failure			0
' we never know how long we have from the start of appendicitis to the appendix bursting - in some cases the pressure builds up quickly , within a few hours , but in other cases a patient can have appendicitis for several days , ' explains mr @entity119			1
the problem is that if there is no pain or if it comes and goes , diagnosis can be delayed			0
' the pain might settle down and the patient will think they 're getting better , ' says mr @entity119 , ' but what 's happening is the omentum , a large apron of fat that acts as the guardian of the abdomen , wraps itself around the appendix as the body tries to protect itself from infection			1
' they used about six litres of fluid to wash all the infection away appendicitis can be diagnosed with blood tests			0
' the white cell count may increase with infection , ' says mr @entity119			0
' we can also use an ultrasound examination or a ct scan to look at the appendix			0
' the diagnosis is usually confirmed in hospital as @entity250 surgeries , adds mr @entity119 , ' do n't have all the equipment in their surgeries that we have in hospital			0
we usually have a diagnosis within 24 hours in hospital '			0
a laparoscopy - where a tiny camera is inserted through a small incision near the navel to get a look at the appendix - can be carried out under general anaesthetic			0
if appendicitis is confirmed , an appendicectomy is carried out at the same time			0
@entity0 's burst appendix was picked up just in time			1
he underwent three - and - a - half hours of keyhole surgery after arriving at @entity268			1
' when i came round they said they 'd used about six litres of fluid to wash all the infection away , ' he says			0
his mother , @entity275 , father , and daughters , @entity278 , 15 , and , @entity279 , 11 , were waiting for him on his ward			0
' my mum used to be a nurse and after i was discharged from hospital she told me the first death she 'd dealt with was caused by a burst appendix - it had worried her while i was in hospital			1
' but even after his surgery , @entity0 was not out of the woods - two days later , while he was still in hospital , his temperature started to climb			1
a scan revealed he 'd developed an abscess in his pelvis			1
these are more common in people who have had a burst appendix and can appear up to five days after surgery , says mr @entity119 , and patients who 've already been discharged can find themselves being readmitted urgently for this reason			1
symptoms include stomach pain , flu - like symptoms and diarrhoea			1
a pelvic abscess is usually drained by radiologists guided by ultrasound			0
@entity0 stayed in hospital for six days , and left with antibiotics			1
he had lost five kilos ( nearly 8lb ) in that time			0
however , seven weeks on , his appetite has returned and he is as active as ever			0
' i am running again , weight lifting and my stamina feels as good as ever it was , ' he says			0
' i do n't blame my gp for not diagnosing appendicitis			0
the experience has made me realise how lucky i am			0
