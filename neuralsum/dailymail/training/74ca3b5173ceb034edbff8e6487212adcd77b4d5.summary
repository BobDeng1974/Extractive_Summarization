important discussions : prime minister @entity1 has recalled @entity2 for today @entity1 was forced to delay plans for immediate military strikes on @entity5 last night after being warned he faced losing a @entity7 vote			1
the prime minister battled desperately to get a consensus for a missile attack , but was forced by @entity10 and @entity12 rebels to allow @entity14 inspectors time to report on last week ’s chemical weapons atrocity			2
mps will vote tonight on a hastily prepared motion which still supports the principle of military action			1
however , it will not now be carried out until ‘ every effort ’ has been made to secure a @entity14 agreement , and even then , direct @entity24 involvement would require a second commons vote			2
the decision to wait for a second vote is a humiliating setback for mr @entity1 who had privately promised @entity29 that @entity24 would stand shoulder to shoulder with the @entity32			0
@entity24 officials had to phone their counterparts in the @entity32 last night to explain that president @entity29 would have to go it alone or wait to see if mr @entity1 can persuade mps to back him in the coming days			0
mr @entity1 had little choice , because losing a @entity7 vote could have triggered his own downfall			0
a senior source said : ‘ @entity63 has been playing politics when they should have been thinking about the national interest			0
' their position has changed consistently over the last 24 hours , finally ending in demands they had not even hinted at before			0
’ lending her support : @entity57 mp ( left ) attends an event organised by @entity53 to protest against potential @entity24 involvement in the @entity5 conflict in @entity50 , @entity75			2
another protester is seen ( right ) ' hands off ' : people take part in a protest organised by the @entity53 calling for no military attack government sources last night said mr @entity1 was still determined to get approval for a retaliatory strike on @entity5 within days			1
' @entity63 has been playing politics when they should have been thinking about the national interest ' @entity46 source a second @entity7 vote is likely to be held early next week , and could even come as soon as tomorrow or saturday			2
mr @entity1 will now rush out an @entity89 - style intelligence dossier on @entity5 this morning in a desperate bid to persuade his own mps – and @entity63 – that @entity93 ’s use of chemical weapons must be met with a show of force from the @entity97			1
last night it was unclear whether the @entity32 will press ahead with plans for a missile bombardment this weekend – or pause its assault to see if mr @entity1 can deliver @entity24 support			0
watching on : police stand guard outside @entity46 during an event organised by @entity53 to protest against potential @entity24 involvement in the @entity5 conflict in @entity75 opinion : a woman holds a placard as she takes part in a protest organised by the @entity53 calling for no military attack on @entity5 from the @entity32 , @entity24 or @entity114 , outside the entrance of @entity46 taking a shot : an opposition fighter fires an rocket propelled grenade during clashes with regime forces over the strategic area of @entity123 , situated on the only road linking @entity125 to central @entity5 mr @entity10 ’s decision to withdraw support for immediate attacks on @entity5 dealt a major blow to the prime minister as he prepared to deliver the speech of his life			1
if mps have the slightest suspicion that attacking @entity5 will cause more suffering than it can possibly prevent they have a fundamental moral duty to vote @entity136 more just before 6pm the @entity63 leader , who has dithered for days over the issue , said he would order his divided party to vote against immediate action , to allow the @entity14 more time to consider evidence about the atrocity			1
within an hour the @entity143 had issued its own parliamentary motion saying it would not act until the @entity145 had had time to consider the report of the weapons inspectors			0
a government source said mr @entity10 had ‘ barely mentioned the @entity14 ’ when he held talks with mr @entity1 and @entity152 in @entity46 on tuesday			1
would bombing @entity5 be lawful ? @entity24 and the @entity32 insist it would be , but the truth is far from clear			2
it ’s hard to see how @entity5 ’s reported chemical attacks against its own citizens present a direct threat to either country			2
what specific laws or @entity14 conventions might be used as justification ? the @entity162 allows for military action on only two grounds – in self - defence , or if action is approved by the @entity145			1
@entity168 has made clear its intention to veto any proposed @entity45 resolution authorising action – as has @entity172			0
can a military strike be legal without a @entity14 resolution ? unclear			0
in 1999 , the @entity176 bombing campaign against @entity177 was launched without one , with @entity178 and president @entity179 seeking to justify it on humanitarian grounds to protect @entity183 civilians			0
the intervention was widely welcomed , but its legality was questionable			0
a similar humanitarian argument is being used to defend intervention in @entity5			2
if president @entity93 is proved to have launched poison gas attacks on his own people , he will be in breach of the @entity192 , an international agreement dating back to 1925 – to which @entity5 is a signatory – banning the use of chemical weapons			2
but breaching the protocol does n’t provide a clear justification for military action and it normally applies to international conflicts , rather than civil wars			1
does the @entity14 have a ‘ responsibility to protect ’ the @entity5 ? in 2005 , following the hideous atrocities committed in @entity204 and @entity205 in the 1990s , the @entity14 brought forward an initiative called the ‘ responsibility to protect ’			1
it was designed to protect the innocent from genocide , war crimes and ethnic cleansing and places a duty on individual states to prevent such horrors within their borders , and an obligation to intervene if they see it elsewhere			0
but former @entity14 assistant secretary - general , @entity217 , says the doctrine does not necessarily justify the use of force			0
all diplomatic efforts must have been tried first , and even then military intervention requires the backing of the @entity45 – taking @entity1 and president @entity29 back to square one			0
does the pm need parliamentary backing for a bombing campaign ? technically , no. he retains the power , under @entity229 , to use military force without parliamentary approval			0
however , all recent major military interventions – including the wars in @entity89 and @entity234 – have been preceded by a @entity7 vote			1
the government has made clear it will ‘ respect the outcome ’ of tonight ’s			1
warzone : free @entity240 fighters run to take cover from snipers loyal to president @entity93 near @entity125 airport wreckage : @entity5 walk in a heavily damaged street in the country 's eastern town of @entity247 response : @entity14 chemical weapons experts wearing gas masks carry samples from one of the sites of an alleged chemical weapons attack in the @entity256 neighbourhood of @entity257 rallying : the local @entity5 community protests against @entity32 involvement in @entity5 , in @entity260 , @entity261 he then phoned the prime minister on tuesday night to say he needed a ‘ @entity14 moment ’ before he could act – prompting @entity24 to table a @entity145 resolution yesterday despite the certain knowledge it would be blocked by @entity168			1
he then visited @entity46 again yesterday to demand that the inspectors be allowed to report , even though they have not been asked to rule on whether @entity93 was responsible for last week ’s atrocity			1
with dozens of @entity271 also warning they were yet to be convinced by the case for an attack , mr @entity1 was facing the prospect of a potential @entity7 defeat and had no choice but to give way			0
a @entity46 spokesman said the new commons motion ‘ reflects the prime minister ’s respect for the @entity14 process – something he made clear to president @entity29 several days ago ’			1
the 370 - word motion agrees that military action may be necessary and would be legally sound			1
but it ’s awash with conditions , caveats and turgid language			0
it says : ‘ @entity292 : ' deplores the use of chemical weapons in @entity5 on 21 august 2013 by the @entity93 regime , which caused hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries of @entity5 civilians ; ' recalls the importance of upholding the worldwide prohibition on the use of chemical weapons under international law ; ' agrees that a strong humanitarian response is required from the international community and that this may , if necessary , require military action that is legal , proportionate and focused on saving lives by preventing and deterring further use of @entity5 ’s chemical weapons ; ' notes the failure of the @entity14 @entity45 over the last two years to take united action in response to the @entity5 crisis ; ' notes that the use of chemical weapons is a war crime under customary law and a crime against humanity – and that the principle of humanitarian intervention provides a sound legal basis for taking action ; ' notes the wide international support for such a response , including the statement from the @entity327 on 27 august which calls on the international community , represented in the @entity14 @entity45 , to " overcome internal disagreements and take action against those who committed this crime , for which the @entity5 regime is responsible " ; ' believes , in spite of the difficulties at the @entity14 , that a @entity14 process must be followed as far as possible to ensure the maximum legitimacy for any such action ; ' therefore welcomes the work of the @entity14 investigating team currently in @entity257			1
' whilst noting that the team ’s mandate is to confirm whether chemical weapons were used and not to apportion blame , agrees that the @entity14 secretary general should ensure a briefing to the @entity14 @entity45 immediately upon the completion of the team ’s initial mission ; ' believes that the @entity14 @entity45 must have the opportunity immediately to consider that briefing and that every effort should be made to secure a @entity353 backing military action before any such action is taken			1
before any direct @entity24 involvement in such action a further vote of the @entity357 will take place			0
' notes that this motion relates solely to efforts to alleviate humanitarian suffering by deterring use of chemical weapons and does not sanction any action in @entity5 with wider objectives			2

@entity2 has been recalled today to consider response to @entity5 atrocity
mps to be asked to agree principle that military action may be justified
protesters demonstrate near @entity46 against @entity379 intervention
the government produced an @entity89 - style dossier for all mps to set out their case for intervention ;
@entity386 and @entity387 were among four *members* of the @entity389 *rumoured* to be harbouring ‘ grave doubts ’ about the rush to war ;
party whips were *scrambling* to get @entity383 home from *abroad* for tonight ’s vote ;
