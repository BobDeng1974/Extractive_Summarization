i could think of no better reason to ask her			0
' miss @entity26 said she had put thoughts of a wedding aside whilst supporting @entity0 on his road to recovery			1
the couple joke how mr @entity0 's constant refusal to tie the knot before his illness struck - even betting his mum £ 100 he never would - formed the basis of a test by doctors to see whether he was brain damaged as a result of the illness			1
miss @entity26 , 41 , said : ' we had to ask @entity0 a question that we were sure he would know , so i said to ask him whether he would marry me - and his immediate answer was no ! we knew straight away then that he was fine			1
' she said she was stunned when he asked her and described how their relationship had not changed			0

as well as learning to walk again mr @entity0 is undergoing facial reconstruction , which will continue next year with four more operations planned			1

' you have to see yourself doing it and get there , ' mr @entity0 said			2

i was pretty much out of it			0
for them , they were living it			0
' mr @entity0 spent that day working on the @entity171 - a charity he and @entity33 set up - before going out with friends in the evening where they raised a glass of champagne			1
' it was n't in celebration or commiseration , just an acknowledgment really of what happened a year ago , ' he added			0
' that date will always be significant to me			0
that is my @entity183 , that is where it all started again for me			0
