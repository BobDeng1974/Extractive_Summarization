a players ’ meeting called after the fourth successive @entity3 defeat emerged on wednesday as the pivotal event leading to @entity5 becoming an @entity7 outcast			1
the summit in @entity9 — without team management present — was the idea of @entity13 , the @entity7 vice-captain who had been dropped after the @entity3 were lost in @entity14			1
prior , who regards the @entity7 team ethic as all - important , still wanted an opportunity for the players to discuss without fear of recrimination how they could improve dressing - room morale and the team environment			0
video : scroll down to see @entity23 trying to get out of the way a @entity25 over critic : @entity5 told @entity27 the issues that the @entity7 players had with his management hitting out : @entity13 has blasted accusations from @entity5 's friend @entity23 tough time : prior struggled in @entity33 and was dropped after the third test the consensus within the squad was that @entity7 team director @entity27 had been too much of a ‘ headmaster figure ’ during the tour and needed to relax his iron grip to get the best out of the team			1
it was after the meeting following the @entity45 defeat that @entity5 , rather than captain @entity46 , took it on himself to tell @entity27 where the players felt he was going wrong			1
the @entity50 have refused to clarify the details of the fallout because of legal complications , including confidentially clauses in the @entity5 settlement			0
but this version of events from inside the dressing room tallies with that of the @entity5 camp , who maintain that their man was the only player prepared to tell @entity27 some home truths			2
it also brings some context to the explosive tweets on wednesday by broadcaster @entity23 , @entity5 ’s flag - waver - in - chief , who claimed prior told his team - mates at the summit that @entity27 was ‘ behaving like a headmaster ’ and that they were playing in a ‘ schoolboy environment ’			1
according to @entity23 , prior added : ‘ @entity72 , this is our team			2
’ happier times : @entity5 ( left ) and @entity76 celebrate @entity3 victory @entity77 in 2010 @entity23 further tweeted , after challenging @entity13 to take legal action if the accusations were incorrect : ‘ you stabbed @entity5 in the back , yet you agreed with him re @entity27 ’s dictator style			1
makes you a flaming hypocrite			0
‘ for the record , @ @entity85 ( prior ) led the @entity7 team meeting after @entity88			0
’ prior responded : ‘ i do n’t do this pr , spinning media rubbish , but i refuse to be attacked by a bloke that knows very little about what goes on in the @entity7 set - up apart from rumour , gossip and hearsay from certain individuals			0
‘ i ’m not the kind of person to divulge what is said in team meetings , but all i will say is that @entity27 , @entity46 and the rest of my team - mates know exactly what i said and the way it was meant			0
’ re-integrated : team - mate @entity13 posted this picture of @entity5 on @entity110 in late 2012 with the caption : ' " re-integration complete			2
' ironically , prior had acted as peacemaker when @entity5 was left out of the @entity7 team in 2012 following a number of issues over his contract			1
but the wicketkeeper continued his attack on @entity23 by saying : ‘ there is no story here , just an attempt to knock someone who has only ever had the team ’s best interests at heart and tried my best on and off the field to help the @entity7 cricket team			0
‘ i can hold my head up high in that knowledge ! ’ taking a battering : @entity23 ( right ) faces @entity25 in the nets at the @entity135			0
