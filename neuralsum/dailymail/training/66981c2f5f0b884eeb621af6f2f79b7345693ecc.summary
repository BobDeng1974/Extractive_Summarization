click here to read @entity2 's thoughts on the tragic death of @entity4 and cricket 's reaction we ’re all shocked by the news of @entity4 ’s death			1
sport can be dangerous , but it ’s not supposed to end like this			0
you just ca n’t make any sense out of it			0
i ’m just desperately sad for @entity4 ’s family and friends , and for the whole of @entity20 cricket			2
i hope the feelings of the lad who bowled the ball , @entity22 , are n’t forgotten			1
i ’m sure he wo n’t be – there ’s a good support network around players these days			1
but it will be a hard thing for him to come back from			0
i remember the incident with @entity31 and @entity32 during a test in @entity34 in 1975			1
but @entity31 , who was a team - mate of mine at @entity63 , had hit @entity64 on the head in the days before helmets			1
@entity32 collapsed and swallowed his tongue			2
he had to be resuscitated by the @entity53 physio @entity68 , who said his heart had briefly stopped beating			0
technically , i suppose you could say he was dead for a few moments			0
mercifully for everyone , @entity32 pulled through , but i always felt @entity31 was never the same bowler after that			1
he was a thoughtful chap , and the fact that @entity32 came so close to dying was tough for him to deal with			2
this tragedy is just desperately sad for @entity4 ’s family and friends , and for the whole of @entity20 cricket @entity32 is hit on the head by a @entity31 delivery - chatfield survived , but @entity31 was never the same @entity22 was warmly embraced by team - mates and cricketers at @entity85 on thursday the @entity86 said they were monitoring @entity22 and would offer support next summer during a county match , we were playing on an uncovered pitch – and @entity31 just did n’t want to bowl			1
he was really suffering , and he still gets asked about it today			0
he ’s still uncomfortable about it now – and @entity32 did n’t even pay the ultimate price			2
so just imagine how young @entity22 must be feeling			0
you just hope he does n’t blame himself			0
batsmen have better protection these days , and i do n’t see this as being an issue about the safety of helmets			0
it was just a freakish accident			0
but how , as a bowler , do you deal with something like this ? how can you ever love the game again ? my heart goes out to @entity22			1
a helmetless @entity112 ( front left ) is down in pain after being hit in the box by @entity57 ( right ) video @entity4 dies from head injuries			1

@entity22 bowled the ball which struck @entity4 in the head
@entity22 must *n't* blame himself , and he needs a good support network
i remember a similar incident between @entity31 and @entity32
even though @entity32 lived , @entity31 was never the same bowler again
