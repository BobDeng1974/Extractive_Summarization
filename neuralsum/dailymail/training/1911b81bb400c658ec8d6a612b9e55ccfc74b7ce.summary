by @entity0 published : 03:38 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 05:10 est , 6 november 2013 nineteen - year - old @entity1 was crowned @entity2 2013 in a glittering ceremony – but it was not aired by @entity6 ’s state broadcaster , which dropped it from its schedules for the first time in 25 years			1
@entity10 , president of the state tv station , @entity11 , deems the contest – which launched the careers of screen sirens @entity15 and @entity16 - a sexist anachronism			1
the final of @entity2 , which took place at the end of last month , was shown instead by private television network @entity21 , with 900,000 people tuning in			0
ceremony : @entity25 is crowned with the title of @entity2 2013 in @entity27 - but the event was n't shown on prime - time tv living the thigh life : @entity6 @entity31 , 19 , performing during the @entity2 2013 contest @entity10 , 68 , believes it ’s an event that reinforces a two - dimensional view of women			1
she told @entity36 : ‘ perhaps here , even if things are changing , which they are , the prevailing image of women [ on television ] is as housewives , mothers … or as showgirls , that kind of thing			1
’ she added : ‘ a woman must make a name for herself because of her talent , her ability			0
she must have the opportunity to express her capabilities … public tv should not , in my opinion , be sending out the message , ' look … you can become someone if you 're beautiful '			2
‘ no , you can become someone if you are committed , know how to value [ your ] own talent , know how to highlight it , and cultivate it			0
and then , if you 're beautiful , all the better			0
’ house speaker @entity62 , of the @entity63 welcomed @entity11 ’s decision saying : ‘ this is a civilised and modern choice			1
outspoken : @entity10 is fed up with @entity6 tv portraying women as housewives and showgirls @entity10 says that the @entity2 contest sends out the wrong message			1
pictured is contestant @entity73 , centre , reacting after advancing to the final of @entity2 2006 ‘ we should be delighted that @entity6 women can now have a chance to make themselves appreciated and valued without parading wearing a number			1
only two per cent of women on tv express and opinion and speak			2
the rest are silent and more often than not semi-dressed			0
’ but @entity84 , organiser of the show , hit back , saying : ’ maybe the honourable @entity62 does not know that across the country hundreds of local councils are hosting similar events with thousands of young women happily taking part in - neither naked or silently - to acquire that visibility that no other event allows them to in a clean and serious way			2
‘ these sort of beauty contests have been taking place in the civilised world for years and is not only an appreciation of a woman ’s beauty but also gives her the opportunity to express her thoughts and ideas			0
it does not degrade women and i would love the opportunity to explain that to the honourable @entity62			2
@entity6 actress @entity15 waves with finalists for the @entity2 2001 beauty contest in @entity113 , @entity6			1
miss @entity15 got her ' big break ' in the contest ‘ i have been in talks with @entity11 for several years to try and update the format and bring it more into modern times and we are still in talks at the moment			1
’ following the decision to drop the show the @entity123 ’s official newspaper @entity122 said : ’ rather than criticising @entity2 , it is better to let it fall into the oblivion that it deserves and instead condemn other forms of female manipulation such as the increasing willingness to turn to cosmetic surgery to perfect themselves			0
’ it also hit out at the @entity6 tv staple diet of scantily clad women , saying : ’ we have enough young ladies in bikinis , we see them on all channels at all hours			1
@entity2 has become an old wreck but it was not always like that - after the war it was an opportunity for women to display their natural beauty , humble origins and dressed without the aim of starting a showbusiness career			2
political opponents were quick to jump on the bandwagon with @entity153 , of @entity155 ’s @entity154 , saying : ’ it ’s really rather interesting to note that the speaker of the @entity158 has closed the door to @entity2 but thrown it open to @entity160			0
i am not opposed to any show or rally and in fact the more colourful the better but her decision has the air of racism			0
’ @entity169 , of the @entity170 , said : ’ women have a right to show their beauty			2
there is nothing scandalous in silent women dressed in bikinis			0
what would she prefer ? miss @entity180 ? ’ does she now know that @entity182 women are also not allowed to speak to men unless to members of their own family ? ’ respected @entity6 daily @entity186 said in an editorial : ’ if banning @entity2 from tv makes us feel more modern and civilised as a country then we really are in a bad way			1
’ the @entity2 pageant has been blighted in controversy several times with another row in 2007 when judges asked to be allowed to consider the ‘ size and shape of a contestant ’s bottom ’ as part of the selection criteria			0
last year the rules of the swimwear section were also changed with competitors asked to wear more sober one - piece outfits in either black or white instead of thigh revealing bikinis .			0
