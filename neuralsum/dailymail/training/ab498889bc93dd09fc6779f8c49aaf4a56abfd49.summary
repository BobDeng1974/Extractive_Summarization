a video posted to @entity10 captures the moment that the clergyman turns away from horrified bride @entity13 and her fiancé @entity14 to tell the photographers they have to move			1
it appears that he 's been so annoyed by the constant click - clicking of the camera shutters that he feels they are ruining the sanctity of the moment			0
' please , sirs , leave ' : a bride and groom look shocked as the priest officiating their wedding ceremony turns around to photographers to tell them they have to move or he wo n't carry on in this grab taken from a @entity10 video ' please , sirs , leave , ' says the priest , a stern look on his face indicating that he is not willing to negotiate			1
meanwhile , the bride and groom , who moments earlier had been laughing at a joke cracked by the priest during their wedding in @entity41 , @entity42 , begin to look very embarrassed			1
asked by one photographer where he would like them to go , the priest responds : ' anywhere other than here			1
this is a solemn assembly not a photography session			1
please move or i will stop			1
' i will stop the ceremony if you do not get out of the way			1
' this is not about photography , this is about @entity58			1
' the awkward moment was posted on to @entity10 on tuesday where it has already been viewed nearly 300,000 times			1
it has attracted a storm of comment , including some by people who claimed to be first - hand witnesses			1
unsuspecting : moments earlier the couple had been laughing as the priest cracked a joke one commenter , @entity72 , was the photographer on the receiving end of the priest 's ire			1
' well it 's not about how i clicked the shutter and they would n't be married			0
my job was to capture their event beautifully			0
my intention was n't to kill or hurt anyone with my shutter clicks			0
' that priest was just an ass			2
this was fun outdoor wedding			2
that ’s the reason they did n’t held their ceremony in the @entity94			0
' mr @entity72 told @entity95 that he spoke to the priest before the ceremony began , and was only told not to come into the aisle			2
' his approach was bit wired and rude			0
but anyway , i let it go			0
ceremony started and i was shooting from far angles with 70 - 200 mm lens			0
i was the lead shooter so my job was to get great photos of the couples , reactions , all kinds of expressions , ' said mr @entity72			0
' but when he said “ please sirs leave … … please ” i and the videographer were actually at the back and i was shooting with my 70 - 200mm lens			0
i had no idea why he snapped like that			0
i did n’t want their wedding day to be ruined , so i looked at the bride and groom and i moved on the right			1
' at that moment bride and groom was horrified including the wedding party and all guests			1
' big day : wedding photographer @entity72 said that everyone was horrified by the priest 's behaviour @entity129 , now mrs @entity130 , told @entity95 what happened next			1
' we were both just shocked , ' she said			2
' i thought to myself what is he doing ? @entity14 was shocked also but more concerned about how i felt which is why he looked over to me			2
he knew how much a religious ceremony meant to me			0
' the rest of ceremony went on as we had rehearsed the night before			0
we only got married this past saturday the 14th so we have n't seen any of the video yet			0
we were just sent the small clip that is on @entity10			1
' she said that after the ceremony ended the priest tried to smooth things over with her and her new husband			2
' [ @entity148 ] explained that he sees a lot of nervous young couples that get distracted by the photography and he wanted to prevent that			2
in this case though @entity14 and i were so in the moment we did n't even notice the camera noises			0
' and thankfully , she added , everyone was able to make light of the situation , despite their shock			1
' we were able to laugh about it right away as the bridal party immediately started making jokes and comments about it once the ceremony ended			0
it became a topic of conversation throughout the night , ' she said			0
' i had no idea why he snapped like that ' : mr @entity72 added that , not wanting the couple 's day to be ruined , he moved to the right so that the ceremony could continue but some commenting on @entity10 supported the priest 's actions			1
@entity181 wrote : ' i 'm a wedding photographer , and generally do not come up front unless requested for a specific shot			2
' it 's very distracting to everyone			0
that 's what zoom lenses are for			0
' he should have had a chat beforehand about his requests , but i do n't blame him for asking them to move			2

angry priest tells photographers to move or he *'ll* stop the wedding
' this is a solemn assembly not a photography session , ' he says
