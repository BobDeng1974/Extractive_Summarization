by @entity0 @entity1 with daughters @entity2 , and wife @entity6			1
the family completed 100 outdoor activities in one year to avoid becoming too lazy no one wants to put a draconian ban on their little ones watching the telly			1
but if you drag them off into enough forests and caves and along enough rivers it seems you get the same result			1
@entity1 and @entity21 know , because that ’s exactly what they did to their two daughters after becoming concerned they might lose their childhood to @entity28			1
rather than allow the girls time to settle in front of the box , the couple set @entity2 , ten , and @entity5 , eight , 100 outdoor challenges to complete			1
a year on , they have just ticked off the last of them – sleeping in a ‘ tentsile ’ , a sort of cross between a hammock and a tent which is suspended between two trees			1
the youngsters so enjoyed themselves they are now helping to draw up a fresh list of challenges for the next 12 months			1
interestingly , they now only watch about three hours of television a week			1
over the past year the two sisters have been involved in activities as wide ranging as making a rope swing , preparing and drinking nettle soup and watching a meteor shower from a beach - side bivvy			1
others involved caving , kayaking and hiking – all come rain , shine or snow			1
some of the challenges – which the @entity61 estimate cost only £ 500 to complete – were undertaken on days out from the family ’s home in @entity64 , @entity65 , at weekends ; others during trips to @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , and the @entity72			1
mr and mrs @entity21 did n't want their daughters to spend all their free time watching tv and playing video games snorkelling was one of many water activities the family undertook in coastal parts of the country such as @entity92 @entity5 , whose favourite task was ‘ coasteering ’ , where rocky coastlines are traversed on foot and by swimming , in @entity92 , said : ‘ our friends spend a lot of their free time watching telly or playing on computer games in their bedrooms , luckily we ’ve had the chance to do something different			1
’ mr @entity1 , 44 , a teacher at a special needs school , said : ‘ we ’re just normal , everyday people and not adventurous ourselves , but as we saw our kids growing up , we became more reflective as parents and wanted them to grow up with balance in their lives			1
‘ i think kids these days spend more time indoors than we did			1
they may do a lot of activities , but they do n’t necessarily have freedom to express themselves or explore freely			1
‘ they are protected from risks which makes them very safe , but it makes them unable to take or to manage risks themselves			1
so as to avoid wrapping their daughters up in cotton wool the parents encouraged them to take part in a variety of activities they would n't normally do @entity5 and @entity2 pictured while damming a river			1
the family only left the @entity128 once as part of their adventures when they visisted the @entity133 while on a holiday to @entity135 @entity136 was eight - year - old @entity5 's favourite activity , while the girls ' mother @entity6 enjoyed bivvy - bagging under the stars on a beach ' of course , we always want @entity5 and @entity2 to do things safely , but in most of the challenges there ’s an element of something could happen , they could graze themselves or trap a finger , say			1
' now , if they fall over they tend to shrug it off			1
our girls have taken on a role as ambassadors for adventure			1
’ the girls ’ social skills were also tested as one of the challenges was to stand up in front of their school to give a talk , and support a charity			1
both sisters were in the brownies when they were younger , but found it ‘ a bit arts and crafty and wanted something more rough and tumble ’			1
the family have been invited to speak at a number of outdoor festivals and activities to encourage other families to do similar activities , such as a wild river swim climb a winter summit and skiing were among the tasks which the family took in their stride in all weather conditions all of the 100 adventures cost the family less than £ 500 put together , including walking to tidal islands ( pictured ) and kayak safaris foraging for food and cooking for @entity21 on mother 's day using just one pot were other challenges the family is now planning a list of activities to take on next year , with the hope that other families will be inspired to do the same @entity5 is now in the @entity193 and @entity2 in the @entity194			1
mrs @entity195 , 39 , a primary school teacher , said : ‘ it ’s just about giving things a go and trying things out			2
’ ‘ my favourite activity was bivvy bagging [ where a waterproof cover is put over a sleeping bag so you can sleep outdoors without a tent ] as we got to sleep under the stars and saw a meteor shower on a beach on the @entity210			1
‘ i did n’t like the idea at all at first but it was incredible			2
you would n’t have witnessed that in a tent and we saw it together as a family			1
