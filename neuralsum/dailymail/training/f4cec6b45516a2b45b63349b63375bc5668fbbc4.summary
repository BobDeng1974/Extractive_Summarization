by @entity0 published : 12:00 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 12:25 est , 25 february 2014 a 26 - year - old protester in @entity4 has been hailed as the man who made up ousted president @entity6 's mind to go on the run			1
film producer @entity9 commandeered the microphone on friday night in @entity12 to turn the crowd against an @entity15 - brokered deal to end the conflict between @entity6 and opposition leaders			1
with former boxing champion and opposition leader @entity20 looking on stony - faced , @entity22 , from the western city of @entity19 , made an electrifying impromptu speech denouncing the opposition for ' shaking hands with this killer '			1
opposition protester @entity9 addresses the crowd as opposition leader @entity20 ( looks ) looks on during a rally in @entity12 on friday @entity9 , who learned combat skills in the army cadets , may be recorded as the man who made up @entity6 's mind to cut and run @entity9 , from the western city of @entity19 , made an electrifying impromptu speech denouncing the opposition for ' shaking hands with this killer ' no - one was going to wait for an election later in the year , he said			1
@entity6 had to get out of town by the following morning or face the consequences			1
to the dismay of opposition leaders , @entity44 's emotional address - he broke down on several occasions as he remembered dead comrades among the 80 killed - touched a chord deep within the thousands on @entity48 who roared their approval			1
the opposition had failed to sell their achievements to the ' @entity48 ' , the name for both the square and the protest movement			1
an agreement , painstakingly negotiated with @entity15 foreign ministers over a sleepless night , was effectively dead			1
the writing was on the wall for @entity6			1
he flew out of @entity12 by helicopter that night , @entity4 's acting interior minister said , and on tuesday was on the run somewhere in @entity4 , being sought for ' mass murder '			1
' @entity66 leaders said they had agreed that there would be early elections in december			2
this was the @entity4 people 's last drop of patience , ' @entity9 said			2
photos of those killed in recent violence are seen at a make - shift memorial in @entity12 's @entity48 members of self defence units stand guard at the parliament building in @entity12 today ' emotions were overflowing because we had lost a great number of people			1
suddenly these politicians come and say " @entity6 will stay as president and there will be elections			1
" i have a clear position			2
@entity6 is a terrorist , terrorist @entity91 , for @entity4 , ' @entity9 said			1
that friday night , @entity6 set off on a zig - zag by helicopter and car across eastern and southern @entity4 , looking either for a safe haven or a flight out of the country			1
some believe he may have already decided he was going to flee even before the ' @entity48 ' gave thumbs - down to the agreement			2
@entity4 's opposition , buoyed by the direct intervention of three @entity15 ministers from @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 , had signed an agreement that seemed to meet many of their demands			2
last friday : ( left to right ) @entity20 , leader of @entity4 's @entity111 opposition party , @entity104 foreign minister @entity112 and @entity4 president @entity6 after the signing of the agreement in the @entity114 a man cries after seeing the body of @entity117 , 19 , who was killed in fighting between anti-government protesters and police , carried in procession through @entity48 on february 21 anti-government protesters man the front line barricades following yesterdays clashes with police in @entity48 @entity125 broke out on friday between deputies in @entity4 's parliament when the speaker declared a pause , delaying a debate on a possible resolution calling for president @entity6 's powers to be reduced it provided for early elections , a national unity government and return to a previous constitution that would take away from @entity6 control over the appointment of the prime minister and make - up of the government , and return it to parliament			1
almost immediately , the parliament , where @entity6 's grip had been weakened by desertions by deputies from his @entity150 , began voting many of these proposals into law			1
those who saw @entity6 sign the deal saw an unsmiling figure unhappy about what he was giving away , and aware of the risk he ran in a rapidly - unfolding drama			1
an anti-government protester tends a fire as he mans a barricade in @entity12 last friday protesters guard a bus with captured policemen before they let them go home anti-government protesters man the front line barricades following friday 's clashes with police in @entity48 ' it was as if he knew more about the dire straits he was in			2
he did not seem as invincible and aloof as he did before			2
he did n't look scared but he did not look so sure , ' said one witness to the signing			2
either way , when opposition leaders took the deal to the @entity48 for definitive approval on friday night , it blew up in their faces - thanks to @entity44 's emotional intervention			1
@entity20 and other opposition leaders had already spoken of their achievements in putting a deal together			1
but there was a mixed reception from the @entity48			2
booing , whistling and cat - calls gave @entity44 his cue			1
as the crowds carried open coffins of victims to the stage where he and opposition leaders stood , @entity44 , his voice breaking , jumped to the microphone			1
asked why he took the stage , @entity9 said : ' it was nâ€™t out of ambition and it was n't an heroic deed			2
i was just boiling over			0
when you realise that you have to push harder			0
' when a glass falls , almost reaches the ground , and then suddenly someone tries to catch it right before it actually hits ? we understood that this was what the opposition was doing			2
' we realised that there was only one way , and it was to deliver an ultimatum			0
how could we even negotiate ? the mothers of the fallen needed this kind of statement			0
' that night we had been listening to the speeches from the balcony of the @entity221 building , and it was clear that we had to take the stage			2
the guys came up to me and said , " @entity228 , you are the oldest here , you will give the speech			2
" ' when i was heading to the stage , i did not think about anything			0
they did not let us pass at first			0
but when there are 50 people walking , everyone will notice			0
@entity235 saw us from the stage and waved us through			0
' i was at @entity48 , i heard and saw what people think , so i understood what had to be said			0
i knew that everyone had reached the boiling point , but no one could express it			0
this is no heroic deed			0
the heroes are those who gave their lives for freedom in @entity4			0
' it was clear that we needed to quit dabbling in politics and carrying on negotiations with this terrorist			0
we all believe that @entity6 is indeed a terrorist			1
' ' we ordinary people are saying this to the politicians who stand behind us : ' no @entity6 is going to be a president for a whole year ' , ' he said to roars of support from the crowd			1
' our kinsmen have been shot and our leaders shake hands with this killer			0
tomorrow , by 10 o'clock , he has to be gone , ' @entity9 declared			0
@entity6 was , in fact , gone long before that , flying out of @entity12 by helicopter that friday night to the eastern city of @entity271 , according to acting interior minister @entity272			1
diplomatic insiders say @entity6 may already have had doubts about whether the agreement could hold			1
benefiting from intelligence on the streets , he knew how the wind was blowing			0
two of the three main opposition leaders - former economy minister @entity281 and far - right nationalist @entity282 - left the stage quickly after @entity44 's speech			1
@entity20 returned and apologised for shaking hands with @entity6			1
though ousted by the fledgling new parliament , @entity6 , appearing in the town of @entity271 on saturday , issued a televised statement saying he was still president			1
but the new authorities on monday said he was now wanted for ' mass murder '			0
some reports have him hiding in a monastery in @entity294 , though @entity296 reporters on monday saw no sign of unusual activity there			0
he might be in @entity299			0
given @entity303 's @entity302 fleet has a base in @entity305 , he might even be on a @entity303 ship , some people theorise			0
if @entity9 had not made the intervention he did , someone else would have , one diplomat opined			2
looking back on that heady friday night , @entity9 , who headed a ' self - defence ' unit with a membership of between 40 and 130 fighters , defended his sharp criticism of @entity20 and the other opposition leaders			1
' everything that had been achieved had been by the people of the @entity48			0
but they had achieved nothing , ' he said in an interview in a restaurant in downtown @entity12			0
@entity9 , a single man with a disarming smile whose girlfriend , @entity323 , sat with him , said he had participated ' actively ' in clashes with police though he declined to say what weapons he had used			0
he defended the power of the ' @entity48 ' with the passion of an 18th century @entity106 revolutionary			0
asked when @entity12 's barricades would come down , he replied : ' if the @entity48 disperses , politicians will stop being afraid			0
we are not going away			0
we will not allow a repeat of what happened in 2004 , ' he said			0
he was referring to the @entity335 of 2004 - 5 which stopped @entity6 's first bid for the presidency but produced governments that collapsed amid in - fighting and allowed him to come to power in 2010			1
he spelled out a message that @entity4 's emerging leadership may have to heed carefully as it strives to make a peaceful transition to a @entity345 order			0
the new authorities , he said , must understand that the @entity48 is the real power , not the 450 parliamentary deputies			0
' my declaration from the stage had one aim : to tell the opposition : ' understand this			2
that if you do not fulfil our conditions then things will be as we decide , not as you decide '			0
' ' we simply told them : " lads , act decisively because if you do n't , we will " , ' @entity9 said .			0
