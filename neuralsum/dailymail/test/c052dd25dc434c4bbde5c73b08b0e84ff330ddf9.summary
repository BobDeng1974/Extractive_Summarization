amid the frenetic chaos of a @entity2 derby low on sustained quality came a goal as memorable as any scored in this fixture over the years			0
@entity6 were the better team here			2
they were superior in terms of energy and creativity against a @entity11 side rather inexcusably playing — to use the term their manager hates — with their ‘ flip - flops on ’ once again			1
nothing @entity18 ’s home team did , however , was anywhere near as exquisite as the goal that won this contest for them			1
it was a goal seemingly taken from another day and dropped haphazardly right into the middle of a match that did n’t really deserve it			0
@entity28 ( centre ) connects beautifully with a left - footed volley to fire @entity6 into a 1 - 0 lead against @entity11 @entity11 goalkeeper @entity32 was unable to do anything about @entity28 's 45th - minute strike as he watches it fly into the net the 32 - year - old watches on as the strike - his third for @entity6 - flies over @entity32 in the @entity40 goal the former @entity42 striker wheels away in celebration of his brilliant strike just before the half - time whistle was blown by @entity47 @entity28 seemed overcome with emotion as he fell to the turf shortly after putting @entity6 into a 1 - 0 lead @entity6 : @entity51 6 ; @entity52 6.5 , @entity53 6 , @entity54 6 , @entity55 6.5 ; cattermole 6.5 ; defoe 7.5 ( @entity56 78 ' 6 ) , @entity57 6 , @entity58 7 , @entity59 6 ; @entity60 6 subs not used : @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 booked : @entity53 , @entity55 , @entity59 , @entity57 , @entity58 goals : defoe 45 ' manager : @entity18 @entity11 : @entity32 6 ; @entity71 5.5 , @entity72 6 , @entity73 6 , @entity74 5.5 ; @entity75 6.5 ; @entity76 5 , @entity77 5 , @entity78 5 ( @entity79 57mins 5.5 ) , @entity80 5 ( @entity81 86 ' 6 ) ; @entity82 5 subs not used : @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 booked : @entity71 , @entity74 manager : @entity90 @entity91 : @entity28 referee : @entity47 7 att : 47,563 * @entity93 ratings by @entity95 at the @entity96 @entity28 gave @entity6 a 1 - 0 lead with this brilliant volley - click here to see more from our brilliant @entity101 service only seconds remained in the first half when @entity6 ’s earnest but limited centre forward @entity60 leapt to head a long pass from his own goalkeeper @entity107 towards @entity28			1
still 25 yards out , the former @entity109 striker must have thought about bringing the ball under control			0
he had players arriving in support on either side			0
it would have been the sensible thing to do			0
true goalscorers have a mindset that is always switched to ‘ glory ’ , though , and instead of taking the pragmatic route , @entity28 decided to buy a ticket for the raffle			2
moments after swinging his left foot at the ball he looked up to see it sail over @entity32 in the @entity11 goal			1
all of a sudden , he was holding the winning ticket			0
on a weekend of sensational goals , this was another born of perfect technique , ambition and courage			0
it deserved to win a game that @entity6 deserved to win and it is up to the rest of @entity139 ’s players to ensure it contributes to a run of results that keeps them in the @entity143			1
@entity144 striker @entity60 celebrates in front of the home crowd as the @entity6 take a 1 - 0 lead the @entity6 players smother goal scorer defoe as the team celebrate going into a 1 - 0 lead before the break @entity59 congratulates @entity28 as the @entity6 fans celebrate in the sunshine at the @entity96 certainly the opposition will be sterner than this			1
just what is it that eats the modern @entity11 ? dressed in grey , they did n’t even look like a @entity11 team			2
did they play like one ? sadly , they did			0
@entity11 have been churning out rubbish like this for far too long now and it is depressing to report that it is becoming the norm			2
@entity6 were much improved , unrecognisable from the side who conceded four in the first half here against @entity172 recently			1
that day , half of the @entity6 supporters were back in their cars by half - time			1
here , under a new manager , @entity6 were comfortably better than local opposition who seem to head into derby games expecting to lose			1
@entity6 goalkeeper @entity107 reacts after watching @entity28 's stunning opener during the @entity182 @entity6 boss @entity18 ( left ) celebrates @entity28 's opening goal as @entity11 manager @entity90 looks on the 32 - year - old frontman looked close to tears as both teams left the @entity96 pitch at half - time @entity32 ( left ) seems to share a joke with @entity28 shortly after the @entity6 forward beat him with a wonderful volley it was difficult to understand for long periods what @entity11 were actually trying to do			1
if they were trying to suffocate the game then for a while it worked			0
once they got caught , though , they seemed to possess neither the wit nor the willpower to find a way back			0
@entity6 were not always convincing early on			2
they earned possession and territory off the back of hard work but did n’t do much with the ball			0
a @entity52 cut - back from a corner to the far post was cut out by @entity75 in the 10th minute , , while @entity58 struck a low free - kick at @entity32 and @entity59 ’s header was deflected wide by @entity77 , the @entity11 captain			2
prior to the goal , however , @entity6 ’s play in the final third had been rather unconvincing			2
had @entity11 possessed any forward thrust at all , they might have found a way into the game			2
but once @entity28 ’s left foot brought the @entity96 to its feet , @entity6 rarely appeared in any danger			1
another goal would have settled their nerves and they had opportunities			0
indeed , they looked more dangerous in the second half			0
former @entity6 midfielder @entity74 ( right ) fouls @entity59 during a ferocious second half display @entity80 ( right ) is closed down by @entity57 and @entity52 during the @entity143 clash @entity6 's @entity60 ( centre ) is beaten in the air by @entity11 midfielder @entity75 @entity60 , though , has never been a goalscorer who has scored many goals — spot the contradiction ? — and twice he failed here			1
a header on the hour needed more power to beat @entity32 and then another chance , provided by @entity28 ’s low cross , was spurned on the back of a decision to pivot away from goal and shoot on the turn rather than drive towards goal on his right side			1
we should not be too hard on @entity60			0
he works as hard as any			0
the difference between a journeyman and an international of standing was evident , though , and @entity18 will be glad that predecessor @entity249 at least left him with a striker of pedigree before he was run out of town last @entity253 also failed in front of goal as the clock ticked on while , belatedly , @entity11 found a little something			1
@entity107 was finally asked to work when @entity76 shot from 18 yards in the 78th minute before @entity82 volleyed over from a corner at the death			0
that , in truth , was a real chance			0
a draw , though , would have been a joke			0
@entity11 manager @entity90 admitted afterwards that his team had embarrassed him and it ’s not the first time			2
when the final whistle blew , @entity28 — substituted with 12 minutes left — wore a smile as wide as the river and with good reason			2
his thunderbolt strike , like the @entity274 sunshine , has lit a flame in @entity277 ’s season of gloom			0
they will remember it for a while			0
@entity6 defender @entity282 ( right ) looks to ride the challenge of @entity72 @entity18 gestures to his players during the @entity182 clash at the @entity96 @entity40 goalkeeper @entity32 punches the ball clear as @entity73 challenges @entity288 @entity28 was replaced by winger @entity56 during the closing stages of the second half at the @entity96 @entity292 boss @entity18 congratulates @entity28 as the 32 - year - old striker leaves the pitch with the score at 1 - 0 @entity6 captain @entity296 gestures to the home fans after the final whistle at the @entity96 @entity11 0 - 3 @entity6 apr 14 , 2013 : @entity299 , @entity56 and @entity300 score the goals as @entity302 oversees @entity6 ’s first win at @entity304 @entity305 in 13 years — in his second game in charge			1
cue knee - sliding and fist - pumping from the @entity309 boss			0
@entity6 2 - 1 @entity11 oct 27 , 2013 : six months on from his euphoric celebrations and @entity302 has gone , replaced by @entity249			1

@entity11 0 - 1 @entity6 dec 21 , 2014 : @entity56 lashes in a 90th minute winner to ensure @entity6 fans keep the bragging rights			1
@entity6 1 - 0 @entity11 apr 5 , 2015 : new @entity6 boss @entity18 picks up his first win in his second game in charge thanks to @entity28 ’s thunderbolt .			1

@entity6 earn 1 - 0 @entity182 victory against @entity11 at the @entity96
