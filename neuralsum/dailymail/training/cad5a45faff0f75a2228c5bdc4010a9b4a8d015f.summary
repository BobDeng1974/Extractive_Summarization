dr. @entity0 grabbed the @entity2 's third rail with both hands thursday morning , launching a political attack based on his complaint that liberals are ' making people dependent ' in majority - black @entity9 inner - cities			1
race politics have been the near - exclusive domain of the @entity2 since the civil - rights era of the 1960s , and @entity16 's successful @entity15 bid in 2008 solidified their position			1
but @entity0 – the most prominent black @entity18 in the 2016 presidential picture – told the @entity20 near @entity21 on thursday that the @entity2 now see @entity23 - @entity9 ' support as an entitlement – choosing to ' keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes			1
@entity46 , a @entity47 college student attending the conference , told @entity49 that @entity0 is just hitting his stride			1
' he 's shaking people up and freaking people out , ' @entity46 said			2
' the days of a lily - white @entity18 are starting to fade , and the only people who seem to oppose this energetic and thoughtful black guy are teh @entity2			1
that should tell you something			0
' @entity0 , who led off the conference , couched his talk of a presidential run and committed to little , outlining his positions ' if i were to run – you have to say those things			1
' he addressed @entity64 , school choice issues , @entity9 's chronically out - of - balance federal budget , the @entity68 terror army , @entity69 and the tax code : ' get rid of the @entity71 , ' he urged			2
@entity72 of the @entity73 in @entity74 , dressed as @entity75 , the second signer of the @entity76 , cheered @entity0 during teh @entity20 conference but @entity0 's moves are being watched carefully by @entity18 who wonder if @entity9 's second black president could actually be one of them – a politician who attacks the welfare state and blames government for keeping blacks from succeeding			1
' i think the key is to tell them the truth			0
no more of this hiding what 's going on , ' @entity0 said of his approach to dealing with african - americans			1
' we need to reach out to people who think that maybe being dependent is reasonable as long as they feel safe			2
it really is not compassionate to pat people on the head and say , " there , there , you poor little thing , i 'm going to take care of all your needs			1
your health care , your food and your housing			2
do n't you worry about anything , it 's just all those bad people who are causing you problems			2
i 'm going to fix it "			2
' ' that 's not compassion , ' he said			0
that 's the opposite of compassion			0
that 's making people dependent			0
' the former @entity118 surgeon has taken flack – as @entity121 @entity120 did before him – for opposing race - based affirmative action and welfare policies that helped pull him out of poverty			0
he acknowledged thursday that the complaint gets his attention			0
@entity129 : it 's too soon to know whether @entity0 's conservative message will resonate with black voters ' no nanny state needed ' : @entity134 @entity18 rep. @entity18 said black @entity9 like her ' will rise to the occasion on their own ' ' i hear some people saying ... " he benefited from welfare and all this stuff , and now he wants to get rid of it " , ' @entity0 said , before insisting that ' i 'm not interested in getting rid of the safety net			1
i 'm interested in getting rid of dependency			0
' ' as more and more people hear that message they will recognize who is truly on their side and who is trying to keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes			0
' rep. @entity18 , who last year became the first black @entity18 woman elected to @entity155 , said thursday during a panel discussion about millennial voters that she gets questions from detractors who say , ' " i do n't understand how you can be a black female from @entity134 , and a @entity18			1
... it makes no sense "			0
' it 's ' because i refuse to fit this mold that society is telling me i have to fit into , she explained			0
like @entity0 , she fed the crowd red meat in the form of a slap at the federal government 's ' intrusions ' into the lives of ordinary black @entity9			1
they ' will rise to the occasion on their own , ' @entity18 said			2
' no nanny - state needed			0
' and @entity2 who run the government 's executive branch , she said , ' do n't want us to have the opportunity to rise to the occasion			0

prominent black @entity18 presidential *hopeful* got *aggressive* at the @entity20
' if you ***'re*** black and you oppose the progressive agenda , and you ***'re*** *pro-life* , and you ***'re*** *pro-family* , then they do n't know what to call you '
' it really is not compassionate to pat people on the head and say , " there , there , you poor little thing , i 'm going to take care of all your needs " '
@entity0 , a world - *renowned* retired *pediatric* neurosurgeon , hopes to follow @entity16 with a right - wing black presidency
