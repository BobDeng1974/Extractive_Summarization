the official leading the investigation into missing @entity2 says he is ' confident ' of finding the plane , but admitted the search could take a year			1
@entity5 , a retired @entity6 air chief marshal , said it was important that the search continues with ' urgency ' , ahead of a meeting to discuss operations next week			1
mr @entity5 made the comments a day after the first official report into the disappeared plane revealed air traffic controllers did not notice @entity2 was missing until 17 minutes after it vanished from radar			1
the report also showed officials did not dispatch a rescue team until almost four hours later - despite contacting staff in @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
officials from @entity6 , @entity42 and @entity21 will meet in @entity43 next week to discuss how the search should take place			1
according to the @entity46 , mr @entity5 said : ' that 's a very important meeting because it will formalise the way ahead to ensure that this search continues with urgency and does n't stop at any stage			1
' the search will take probably in the order of eight months , maybe eight to 12 months if we have bad weather or other issues			2
yesterday a month - old report was revealed by the @entity21 government under pressure from grieving families			1
transport minister @entity62 ( right ) said the release was in the interests of transparency report : @entity21 authorities have released the five - page document almost a month after it was finished ' but we 're totally committed to find @entity2 and i 'm confident that with an effective search we will eventually find the aircraft			1
' the preliminary report , written almost a month ago and dated april 9 , was meant to stay confidential but the @entity21 prime minister bowed to demands of families who complained the government had not done enough and published it yesterday			2
the report confirms the plane disappeared from @entity21 radar at 1.21 am on march 8 with 227 passengers and 12 crew on board , and no trace of it has been found since			1
it was passing into @entity89 airspace , and should have been picked up by counterparts there			0
but the report reveals @entity89 air traffic controllers only queried about it with their @entity21 colleagues at 1.38am			2
the @entity21 authorities then contacted area control centres in @entity23 , @entity22 , @entity97 and an operations centre at @entity99 , and none could find any trace of the plane			2
release : as well as the report , authorities have revealed this map showing possible flight paths standing down : crews from several nations searching for @entity2 , pictured in @entity110 , were called off this week but it took another four hours , until 5.30am local time , before a @entity112 in the @entity21 city of @entity114 was activated			1
the report said the @entity117 , which sets worldwide standards , should discuss new methods of real - time tracking to ensure a huge passenger jet is never lost again			1
it said : ' while commercial air transport aircraft spend considerable amounts of time operating over remote areas , there is currently no requirement for real time tracking of these			1
' there have now been two occasions during the last five years when large commercial air transport aircraft have gone missing and their last position was not accurately known			0
' this uncertainty resulted in significant difficulty in locating the aircraft in a timely manner			0
' therefore , the @entity21 @entity139 makes [ its ] safety recommendation to the @entity117			0
' delay : a passage of the report reveals how authorities waited until 5.30am local time before launching a search mystery : the report confirms authorities ' belief that the plane flew either north or south when it vanished as well as the five - page report the government released other information from the investigation into the flight			1
it included audio recordings of conversations between the cockpit and air traffic control , the plane 's cargo manifest and its seating plan			0
@entity21 also released a map showing the plane 's deducted flight path and a document detailing actions taken by authorities in the hours after the @entity169 disappeared from radar			2
another report showed @entity99 at one point thought the plane , built in 2002 , may have entered @entity97 airspace			2
the airline said in the report that ' @entity2 was able to exchange signals with the flight and flying in @entity97 airspace , ' but that @entity97 authorities said they had no information or contact with flight 370			0
@entity21 prime minister @entity183 last week appointed a team of experts to review all the information the government had and decide what should be made public			1
tragedy : the flight had 227 passengers and 12 crew including @entity193 ( left ) and pilot @entity194 @entity21 defence minister @entity62 said today : ' the prime minister set , as a guiding principle , the rule that as long as the release of a particular piece of information does not hamper the investigation or the search operation , in the interests of openness and transparency , the information should be made public			0
' @entity62 said @entity21 's military radar tracked the jet making a turn - back in a westerly direction after playing back radar data the next morning , nearly seven hours after the plane vanished from civilian radar			1
he said he was informed about the military discovery two hours later and relayed this to @entity183 , who immediately ordered a search in the @entity218			0
he defended the military 's inaction in pursuing the plane for identification			0
' the aircraft was categorized as friendly by the radar operator and therefore no further action was taken at the time , ' @entity62 said			0
the cargo manifest , meanwhile , includes a receipt for a package containing lithium ion batteries , noting that the package ' must be handled with care			0
' disappeared : the @entity99 @entity169 which vanished almost two months ago without trace some questions had been raised in march about the batteries and whether they could explode			0
but @entity99 said then that they were in compliance with international requirements and classified as ' non-dangerous goods			0
' meanwhile , @entity99 today advised relatives of passengers who were aboard flight 370 to move out of hotels and return home to wait for news on the search for the plane			2
since the jet disappeared , the airline has been putting the relatives up in hotels , where they have been briefed on the search			2
but the airline said today it would close its family assistance centers around the world by may 7 , and that the families should receive search updates from ' the comfort of their own homes			0
' the airline said that it would establish family support centers in @entity114 and @entity261 , and that it would keep in close touch with the relatives through means including phone calls and meetings			0
@entity99 also said it would soon make advanced compensation payments to the relatives			0
no wreckage from the plane has been found , and an aerial search for surface debris ended monday after six weeks of fruitless hunting			1
an unmanned submarine is continuing to search underwater in an area of the southern @entity277 where sounds consistent with a plane 's black box were detected in early april			1
additional equipment is expected to be brought in within the next few weeks to scour an expanded underwater area			0
the head of the search effort has predicted that the search could drag on for as long as a year .			0
