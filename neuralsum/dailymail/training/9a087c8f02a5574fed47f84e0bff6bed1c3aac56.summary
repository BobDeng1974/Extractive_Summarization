prince @entity0 is to be bumped down to fifth in line to the throne after news the @entity3 and @entity4 are expecting a second baby			1
@entity0 dropped to fourth in the line of succession after @entity9 was born in july last year , and now just days before he is due to celebrate his 30th birthday comes the news that he will fall another place in the royal rankings			1
regardless of whether the new baby is a girl or a boy , it will take @entity0 's fourth place spot , when it is born next year , making it extremely unlikely that the @entity0 will ever become king			1
as well as celebrating his milestone birthday , and inheriting £ 10million pounds left to him by his mother @entity30 , @entity28 has his @entity32 duties to occupy him , and has been heavily involved in the forthcoming @entity33 for injured servicemen and women			2
he is also involved in a number of charities , including @entity38 , which was co-founded by the @entity0 , and works to support orphaned children in @entity40			2
slipping back : regardless of whether the new baby is a girl or a boy , it will take @entity0 's fourth place spot , when it is born next year , making it extremely unlikely that the @entity0 will ever become king third place : @entity0 became fourth in line to the throne after the birth of @entity9 last july as a sibling to @entity9 , the @entity3 and @entity4 of @entity26 ’s second child will also not be expected to be crowned sovereign			1
but second - born royal children - often dubbed the ' spare to heir ' - have on occasion ended up as monarch			2
the country ’s last king , @entity57 , was not meant to accede to the throne and only did so when his older brother @entity60 abdicated over his love for @entity63 divorcee @entity62 in 1936			0
@entity57 ’s father , @entity64 , was also not destined to wear the crown			0
but he outlived his older brother the @entity68 - @entity67 - who died from flu in 1892			0
@entity64 became king in 1910			0
keeping busy : @entity0 has been heavily involved with the forthcoming @entity33 @entity71 and @entity4 ’s new baby will be a great - grandchild to the @entity73 and a great - great - great - great - great - grandchild of @entity73 @entity75			1
when @entity9 was born on july 22 , last year , he automatically became third in line to the throne of @entity78 and 15 other @entity80 nations , following his father the @entity26 , and grandfather , the @entity0			1
he is likely to take the throne as @entity84 around the end of the century - although previous monarchs have not been averse to changing their name , such as the @entity73 's father , who was known as @entity57 , but who ruled as @entity57 because @entity73 @entity75 declared she did not want another ' @entity90 '			0
the new baby will also push prince @entity92 down to sixth place , followed by his daughters @entity95 and @entity96 in seventh and eighth			1
prince @entity60 goes into ninth , with his children @entity98 and @entity100 in tenth and 11th			0
even though @entity105 is older , the changes to the law of succession are not being applied retrospectively			0
the most recent royal baby , @entity106 - the daughter of @entity107 and @entity108 - will become 17th in line to the throne			0
she does not bear a royal title			0
the baby will be a prince or princess thanks to the @entity73 , who stepped in ahead of @entity9 ’s birth to ensure all @entity71 ’s children would become @entity115 with fitting titles			1
the @entity73 issued a @entity117 under the @entity118 in december 2012 when @entity4 was just a few months ’ pregnant , declaring “ all the children of the eldest son of the @entity0 should have and enjoy the style , title and attribute of royal highness with the titular dignity of prince or princess prefixed to their @entity129 names or with such other titles of honour ”			1
a @entity117 in 1917 , issued by @entity64 , limited titles within the royal family , meaning a daughter born to @entity71 or @entity4 would not have been an @entity137 but @entity100 ( forename ) @entity135 instead and a second - born son would also have lacked the @entity137 title and become @entity140 ( forename ) @entity135 rather than a prince			2
@entity71 ’s cousin @entity96 , who was born in 1990 , was the last royal baby to be given the title @entity28			2
the @entity145 and @entity146 ’s daughter @entity100 is also technically a princess , but her parents decided , with the @entity73 ’s agreement , that she would use the courtesy title of the daughter of an @entity145 instead			0
if the baby is a girl , it will be the first time a great granddaughter of a still - serving sovereign has been born in direct succession on the male line since 1897 , when @entity57 ’s sister princess @entity158 was born .			1

new baby will take @entity0 's fourth place spot , even if it is a girl
@entity0 slipped down a place after @entity9 was born last july
