by @entity0 @entity1 : 11:20 est , 19 december 2013 @entity2 : 11:40 est , 19 december 2013 thousands of adults may be needlessly taking tablets for high blood pressure , doctors say			1
a panel of experts in the @entity9 has recommended that adults over 60 should only be prescribed medicine when their blood pressure levels reach 150 over 90 or higher			1
this is due to the side effects that blood pressure tablets can cause , such as fainting and falls in older people and interaction with other medicines they are taking			1
overmedicated ? new guidelines suggest that people over 60 should only take blood pressure tablets when their reading is 150/90 the new guidance was published in the @entity25			1
in it , the doctors stress they are not changing the definition of high blood pressure : 140/90			2
and people with heart disease , diabetes or chronic kidney disease should aim for a reading of 130/80 or lower			0
but they do recommend that adults aged 60 and older are given a higher treatment threshold - and only take medicine when their blood pressure levels reach 150 over 90 or higher			1
too aggressive blood pressure treatment can cause fainting and falls in older patients , or bad interactions with drugs they 're already taking for other illnesses , panel members said			1
however much of the existing guidance does remain - such as giving younger adults with a reading of 140/90 medication and also those with diabetes or kidney disease			2
a third of people in the @entity55 and @entity9 have high blood pressure - and a third do not realise			1
it is a major risk factor for heart disease , stroke , and kidney failure			0
a high blood pressure reading is one that exceeds 140/90 millimetres of mercury ( mm hg )			1
the first figure , the systolic pressure , corresponds to the â € ˜ surgeâ € ™ that occurs with each heart beat			0
the condition typically has no symptoms , so it goes undetected or untreated in many people			0
high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease , stroke , and kidney failure in developed countries like the @entity55 , the lifetime risk of developing high blood pressure is now 90 per cent and six million @entity55 take drugs to control it - usually for life			2
people with hypertension - the medical term - are routinely advised to change their lifestyle and eat less salt , lose weight , drink less alcohol , eat more fruit and vegetables and exercise more			0
the new guidelines were based on a review of the most rigorous kind of medical research - studies in which patients are randomly prescribed drugs or dummy pills - published since the last update in 2003			0
the research suggests older patients can avoid major health problems like heart attacks , strokes and kidney disease even when their blood pressure is above the current recommended level , the panel said			2
for many patients , two or three drugs - or more - are needed to bring their blood pressure down			2
many older adults could probably reduce their doses , or take fewer drugs , to reach the new , less strict target , said dr. @entity114 , a panel member and family medicine specialist - researcher at the @entity116			0
while the guidelines were updated by a government - appointed panel , they do n't yet have the government 's endorsement like previous versions			0
and some doctors fear the experts did n't take into account the effects of under treating high blood pressure in older people			1
dr. @entity129 , a @entity130 cardiologist , called the guidelines ' exceedingly important ' given the prevalence of high blood pressure			0
the panel added that the guidelines are simply recommendations , and that doctors should make treatment decisions based on patients ' individual circumstances .			0

@entity9 experts have recommended that adults over 60 should only be prescribed medicine when their blood pressure levels reach 150/90 or higher
this is due to the side effects that blood pressure tablets can cause
these *include* fainting and falls in older people and medicine interactions
but people under 60 and with other health conditions still need medication when their reading is 140/90 - considered ' high '
