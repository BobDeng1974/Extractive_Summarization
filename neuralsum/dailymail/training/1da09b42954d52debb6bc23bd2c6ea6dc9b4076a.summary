by @entity0 the last ever class of cranes at a unique school designed to bring back one of @entity6 's rarest birds are ready to spread their wings after graduating			1
environmentalists at the @entity10 in @entity11 have spent ten weeks taking classes on foraging , feeding and making nests in the wild			2
after passing their exams , the 16 young avian pupils from the class of 2014 are set to be introduced to a secret wetland location in @entity19			1
pecking order : two common crane chicks battle it out to be top of the class at the @entity10 in @entity11 spreading their wings : the school is part of the @entity28 which hopes to restore @entity30 cranes to their former homes before they were driven to extinction in the 16th century by over-hunting and the loss of wetlands their graduation marks the end of a five - year initiative launched by the @entity28 to boost dwindling numbers of the common crane			1
in 1980 , there were just two wild cranes left in @entity6 - but through extensive conservation efforts , their population is slowly bouncing back			2
at @entity46 , the birds were given daily exercise and taught how to forage and negotiate the wetlands that will become their wild home			1
@entity51 , head teacher at the sanctuary , said : ' this year 's @entity46 class has really thrived			1
' dinner is served : keepers at the centre take on the role of mother as they feed the chicks via a stick shaped like a parent crane so the young birds do not become accustomed to people ' they 've loved their daily walks and this year we drafted in 40 volunteer @entity68 teachers who took the birds for more than 700 hours of exercise			1
' i 've worked with the @entity28 since day one and it has been the most unforgettable experience			0
' some of the first birds that i raised have had chicks of their own now			0
it 's just wonderful to know that they 're out there , living wild in our landscape once again			2
' the crane students are hatched from eggs taken from a healthy wild population in @entity85			0
the human teachers take on the role of their natural parents , guiding them through their first few months of life			0
they wear grey hooded overalls to disguise their human form and feed them via a stick shaped like a parent crane so the young birds do not become accustomed to people			0
grub 's up : the cranes were also taught how to find their food in an effort to prepare them for life in the wetlands of @entity19 take off : a pair of young cranes attempt to fly before being introduced to the @entity106 , one of @entity6 's key wetland areas after their ten - week course , the birds are taken to the @entity106 where they are introduced to a flock of previous @entity46 graduates			1
it is hoped the crane flock will start to grow naturally as birds reach maturity and start to breed before spreading across @entity6			0
in 2013 , environmentalists were left devastated following the death of the first wild crane to be hatched in @entity6 for four centuries			0
disaster also struck in june when two newborn chicks died			0
the common crane is one of @entity127 â€™s largest birds with a wingspan of between 1.8 to 2.2 metres ( pictured above is a young chick during a lesson using a prosthetic crane head ) @entity132 , @entity133 said : ' with this last class now on the levels we 're all looking forward to the next phase of the project with the cranes settling down to breed and raise youngsters in the wild			2
' putting these iconic birds back in this special place is so exciting			0
it 's a real boost not just for the crane population in the @entity146 , but we hope a symbol of a bright future for the @entity19 wetlands			1

' @entity46 ' opened in 2010 in *bid* to *protect* species from extinction
keepers taught birds to nest , forage and survive in wild on 10 - week course
latest class ends five - year plan to release 100 birds to @entity19 's wetlands
