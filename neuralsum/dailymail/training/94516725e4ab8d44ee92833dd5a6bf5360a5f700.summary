by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the traditional high street bank branch has taken another step towards extinction after @entity5 announced plans to scrap cashiers			1
@entity9 ’s third biggest bank is to transform its branches in a bid to get customers to use self - service machines and cut down on queues			1
instead of waiting to see a cashier at a glass booth , customers will be greeted at the door by staff armed with @entity20 , who will answer their questions in the open reception area and help them with the self - service machines			1
upgrade : @entity9 ’s third biggest bank says the changes will save customers time			1
it also said that people are increasingly carrying out transactions such as transferring money online @entity5 claims the new branches will save customers time			1
it also said that people are increasingly carrying out transactions such as transferring money online and only use branches if they need more complicated advice			1
but yesterday campaigners warned that the new service could alienate pensioners and small businesses			0
@entity41 , director of the campaign for @entity43 , said : ‘ banks are trying to move too fast			0
‘ we do n’t want to stand in the way of progress but they have n’t moved for years and now they ’re rushing ahead shouting we ’ve gone digital without any regard for small business , charities , churches , schools and vulnerable customers			2
‘ these people rely on the traditional bank branch and the privacy it offers them			2
’ to trial the new system , @entity5 has scrapped cashiers and counters in 37 of its 1,560 bank branches , including @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 , in @entity69			0
the cashiers who are scrapped will be retrained as ‘ community bankers ’ and given a 2.8 per cent pay rise – roughly equivalent to £ 500			0
instead of being stuck behind a counter they will help customers in the reception area and answer queries by using @entity20			1
customers who need to deposit sums of up to £ 4,000 or withdraw up to £ 750 will be asked to use self - service tills			0
anyone who wishes to open an account will also be served in the reception			1
homebuyers who want a mortgage and investors will be shown to private rooms			0
the new system means many customers will need to exchange cash in an open seating area in front of other customers , or go to one of the more private meeting rooms			1
concern : campaigners have warned that the new service could alienate pensioners and small businesses but at busy lunchtime periods there may not be a free room available , and the waiting time for these rooms can be substantial as they are typically used for more complicated transactions			1
a @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ we want our staff to serve customers side - by - side rather than from behind a glass window			2
we think helping customers make the most of our technology in branch will reduce waiting times			0
‘ as with the traditional branch format , our new branches have just as many private rooms for one - to - one conversations			0
’ banks have appeared determined to push customers online as a cheaper alternative to serving customers in branches			2
they have spent millions developing mobile phone banking apps and super cash machines that also bank cheques and open savings accounts			2
@entity5 also has 7,000 so - called @entity130 – employees who help customers become more comfortable with computers			0
the local branch , meanwhile , has been disappearing			0
some 1,200 towns and villages have lost their only bank branch , and 900 now only have one			0
a report by @entity138 suggests that @entity9 ’s 9,500 - strong branch network will plummet to 7,000 by the end of 2018 .			2
