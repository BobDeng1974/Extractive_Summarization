the cuckolded husband of a woman involved in a ' close relationship ' with the @entity3 has called for him to be sacked from the @entity4			1
@entity5 , whose wife , @entity6 , 43 , is the latest woman to be linked to the bishop , is compiling a formal complaint against @entity9 over his intimate friendship with her			1
it has been claimed that @entity12 had relationships with up to four women , breaking his vow of celibacy			1
as well as stating @entity12 broke his celibacy vow , the complaint will say he has gone against @entity4 teachings on adultery , marriage and family life by having a close relationship with mrs @entity20 , a 43 - year - old mother - of - two , and an affair with another married woman			1
mr @entity5 also claims the bishop abused his authority , taking advantage of both women after they turned to him for help with their marriages			1
@entity51 , from the charity catalyst - which helps individuals whose family life has been affected by religious or cult groups - said : ' @entity12 has ... by his own admission on at least one occasion , committed adultery with a married woman , which in the eyes of the @entity4 is a mortal sin			2
' he needs to be laicised - what most people would understand as defrocked - and removed from the priesthood			2
' mr @entity5 , a 44 - year - old banker , said : ' his behaviour has been appalling			1
to think that this is a person who people turn to for marriage advice is unbelievable			0
it makes him a hypocrite			0
' @entity12 , 63 , resigned as @entity18 a fortnight ago , saying he had been ' unfaithful to my promises as a catholic priest '			1
he said it ' was the easiest way to avoid further embarrassment , disappointment ... and shame for the church			0
' @entity5 is compiling a formal complaint against @entity9 over his intimate friendship with @entity6 @entity12 says he still wants to be a priest , despite being forced to resign a fortnight ago in his resignation statement added that his actions ' were not illegal and did not involve minors			1
' despite this , the bishop insisted he wanted to remain in the @entity4 as a priest			2
mr @entity5 discovered his wife 's affair after she did not attend choir practice at their local church			1
he went to drop off some music through her letterbox to find she was not home at around 10pm			0
he said : ' i thought it was really weird			0
i decided it was time to test my suspicion that she was having an affair			0
‘ i went up to the bishop ’s residence and her car was there			0
i checked and it was there all night			0
’ since then a second love affair with a married mother - of - three six years ago has come to light , and he has been linked to two other women			0
questions have been raised over whether the @entity4 turned a blind eye to the bishop 's behaviour			2
after writing a letter to the bishop asking whether the pair were having an affair , mr @entity5 did not receive a reply			1
he then sent a second letter to the bishop , as well as the @entity29 , the @entity33 and cardinal @entity26 , but none of them have responded			0
mr @entity5 said : ‘ the thought of losing my wife to someone who has behaved so irresponsibly is awful			1
‘ he has abused his authority to the extent that he has allowed a married woman and mother of two children to sleep in his house and he has been completely blind to the emotional impact on the people affected by this			0
‘ for someone in his position to create that much emotional distress without really noticing or thinking about the consequences and then failing to explain himself is arrogant			0
@entity12 technically remains both a priest and a bishop , even though he is no longer responsible for @entity141 and @entity142 .			2
