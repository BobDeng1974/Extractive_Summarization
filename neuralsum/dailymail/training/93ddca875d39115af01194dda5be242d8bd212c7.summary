some older women with breast cancer could safely avoid radiotherapy without harming their chances of survival , say researchers			1
older patients who are given breast - conserving surgery and hormone therapy gain very ‘ modest ’ benefit from radiation treatment , they found			1
the findings suggest that carefully selected patients who are at low risk of recurrence could avoid the health risks and side effects associated with radiotherapy , such as fatigue and heart damage			2
some older women with breast cancer could safely avoid radiotherapy without harming their chances of survival , say researchers currently older women with early - stage hormone - sensitive breast cancer are offered surgery to remove their tumour , followed by hormone treatment and radiotherapy			1
conventional external beam radiotherapy , which irradiates the whole breast , involves many hospital visits , often spread over several weeks to reduce side effects , such as tissue shrinkage			0
few trials have assessed the benefits of radiotherapy in older women treated using breast - conserving surgery , where the lump is removed not the whole breast			2
scientists at the @entity44 led an international trial involving 1,326 patients aged 65 or older with early - stage hormone - sensitive cancer , the most common form of breast cancer			1
their tumours were surgically removed and had not spread to the lymph nodes underneath the arm , says a report in the journal @entity55			0
half of the women were given radiation as well as hormone treatment and half were given hormone treatment alone			1
after five years , roughly 96 per cent of both groups had survived , and most deaths were not caused by breast cancer			1
@entity65 , of the charity @entity66 , said : ‘ these results are very interesting ' around 1.3 per cent of those given radiation had cancer recur in the treated breast compared with 4.1 per cent of those who did not receive radiotherapy			1
pregnant women are more than twice as likely to quit smoking if they are offered shopping vouchers as part of a treatment plan , according to a study			2
researchers from @entity82 and @entity83 universities divided 612 pregnant smokers into two groups			0
@entity56 were offered only advice and nicotine replacement therapy to help them stop smoking			0
half were offered up to £ 400 worth of vouchers to be used at stores including @entity93 , boots and @entity95 if they had the advice and treatment and quit while pregnant			0
according to a report in the @entity100 , 69 women quit from the group offered shopping vouchers , and 26 from the other group – 23 per cent and 9 per cent respectively			0
the results were confirmed by urine and saliva testing			0
after 12 months , 15 per cent of women who were offered financial incentives remained off cigarettes compared with4 per cent in the other group			0
the report says that widening the incentive scheme could produce public health benefits ‘ as important as vaccines ’			0
but critics are likely to claim ‘ bribery ’ is being used to get mothers to maximise the health of their children			0
in the @entity122 around 5,000 babies a year die in the womb or shortly after birth from mothers smoking in pregnancy			0
professor @entity127 , of the @entity44 ’s @entity128 , said : ‘ while radiotherapy will remain the standard of care for most women after breast - conserving surgery , the absolute reduction in risk of recurrence from radiotherapy in low - risk older women receiving hormone treatment is very modest			1
this makes omission of radiotherapy an option for selected older patients			2
’ in the @entity122 , around 50,000 women develop breast cancer each year – four out of five in the postmenopausal years after the age of 50 – and almost 12,000 women die each year			1
radiotherapy is offered to all women who have breast conserving surgery – around 35,000 a year			2
the @entity44 researchers stressed that the results were only applicable to patients aged 65 or older with grade 1 and 2 , node - negative tumours up to 3cm in size			1
dr @entity157 , clinical director at the charity @entity158 , said : ‘ we know that some older women find the prospect of radiotherapy such a burden that they opt to have a mastectomy to avoid it , so this research will be hugely welcomed by many patients			1
‘ @entity149 can cause side effects such as pain and fatigue , which can be very daunting			0
‘ however , this study is on a group of patients with a particular kind of breast cancer			1
findings also show rates of local recurrence were nearly 3 per cent higher in women who did n’t have radiotherapy treatment			2
‘ radiotherapy is still a highly effective treatment for many women with breast cancer			1
’ @entity65 , of the charity @entity66 , said : ‘ these results are very interesting			0
however , with only five years ’ follow up the results do need to be approached cautiously			0

older breast cancer patients could avoid radiotherapy , study finds
1,326 patients aged 65 or older took part in @entity44 trial
half of the women were given radiation as well as hormone treatment
other half taking part in study were given hormone treatment alone
after five years , roughly 96 per cent of both groups had survived
