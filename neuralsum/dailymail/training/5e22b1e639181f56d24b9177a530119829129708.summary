by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:30 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 20:22 est , 28 october 2013 a @entity3 couple are to become parents of two sets of surrogate twin babies created from the same batch of embryos - a phenomenon known as ' twiblings '			1
the children , due in march next year , are being carried by two @entity13 women after a deal was arranged at a @entity16 clinic			2
the ' professional ' couple , from @entity18 , do not want to be named			0
they decided to embark on fertility treatment in @entity13 after a series of failed treatments in the @entity3 and two miscarriages , according to the @entity24			1
a @entity3 couple are to become parents of two sets of surrogate twin babies created from the same batch of embryos - a phenomenon known as ' twiblings ' the number of twiblings has grown in line with the surrogacy industry in @entity13 - where multiple embryos are often implanted from the same batch			1
in the @entity3 , embryos from the same batch would not be implanted into two surrogate mothers in the same cycle			1
the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) guidelines recommend that only one embryo is transplanted			1
this is because having twins or multiple pregnancies is more dangerous and carries an increased risk of complications such as miscarriage and stillbirth			0
the 35 - year - old husband of the couple explained to the @entity24 that he and his 36 - year - old wife had been struggling with fertility problems for 10 years - and did n't want to waste more time			1
once at the @entity58 clinic in @entity16 , their eggs and sperm were fertilised and then implanted into two surrogates			2
he said : ' we had six embryos in the fridge and typically you would use one surrogate , but i thought " get me two surrogates and implant three in each "			2
' a month passed before the couple received two phone calls from @entity13 just days apart - explaining that both surrogates were pregnant with twins			1
the odds of this happening are so rare that the clinic had never seen it before - but the couple plan to keep all four children			2
the children , due in march next year , are being carried by two @entity13 women after a deal was arranged at a @entity16 clinic the amount they have paid the clinic is n't clear - but the average surrogacy package in @entity13 costs around £ 20,000			1
they also have no plans to meet the women carrying their children - seeing it purely as a business transaction			0
' she 'll get paid … we do n't need to see her			0
as long as she 's healthy and delivers my babies healthily , she 's done a job for us , ' the wife of the couple told the @entity24			0
dr @entity100 , medical director of the @entity58 clinic , added that using two surrogate mothers in the same cycle is n't unheard of , especially if a couple is desperate to conceive			0
the ' twiblings ' were conceived after @entity107 treatment			0
this means the mother 's eggs were harvested from her ovaries and were then fertilised in a lab with her husband 's sperm before being implanted into the @entity13 surrogates			1
six embryos were implanted - three into each woman			2
assuming the babies have each developed from two of the three embryos in each woman , those being carried by the same woman are the equivalent of non-identical twins			0
this is because they are from different eggs but are being carried at the same time , in the same womb			0
biologically , they are the non-identical siblings of the babies the other surrogate is carrying .			0

the *unnamed* couple had @entity107 in @entity13 after struggling with fertility problems
six eggs were *successfully* fertilised and three embryos were implanted into each surrogate woman - both became pregnant with twins due in march
this *extremely* rare phenomenon is known as ' twiblings '
in the @entity3 , embryos from same batch would not be implanted into two surrogates - guidelines recommend only one embryo is implanted at once
