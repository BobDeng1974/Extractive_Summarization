by @entity0 published : 11:34 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 11:39 est , 18 october 2012 a family has spoken of the terrifying moment they saw a @entity4 hovering above their house for four hours			1
@entity6 , 50 , was awoken in the middle of the night by flashing lights in the sky over the family home in rural @entity11			1
the grandmother - of - one woke her family up and her daughter ’s fiance caught the shocking images of four blinking lights on video			1
‘ i just woke up all of a sudden and looked out of the window to see all these twinkling lights - they looked like they were moving			2
‘ i was quite apprehensive about it			0
i ’m standing there looking at it and i ’m thinking “ is it watching me ? ” , so i went around the house telling everyone and they all came to have a look			0
' mrs @entity6 describes seeing a circular object hovering and spinning around above her home in @entity47 , @entity27			1
‘ my husband is a fisherman and he ’s spent many hours looking up at the night sky , so he was quite sceptical when i told him , but even he admitted it was strange when he saw them			1
' right there : @entity6 in their back garden pointing towards the part of the sky where she saw the @entity4 on saturday night she says : ‘ eventually we all went back to bed			1
i woke up a further two times , the second time was about four hours later and it was still there , but when i next woke up it was daylight and they had gone			0
‘ it was there for so long that even all the way out here , someone else must have seen it , but perhaps they ’ve been too shy to come forward about it			0
' @entity6 ’s daughter , @entity71 , 27 , had got out of bed to feed her baby at 3am on saturday night when she first heard about the sighting			1
she said : ‘ at first i thought it was just a plane , but my mum said it had been there for a few hours and there was no noise or anything			0
‘ i was quite mesmerised by it all to be honest although my fiance @entity83 , was pretty scared			2
‘ he was smoking at the back door where you could see the lights from and he was genuinely frightened , he kept the door half open so he was n’t actually fully outside			2
' strange : flashing lights are not usually decorating the skyline at the back of the @entity92 home in rural @entity11 the mother - of - one added : ‘ i did n’t really believe in ufos or anything like that beforehand			1
you hear lots of stories , but you do n’t really believe them			0
‘ but this was really really strange			0
after seeing what i ’ve seen , i ’m genuinely wondering if there are actually aliens out there now			0
’ although 95 per cent of all @entity4 reports can be explained , @entity4 expert @entity106 admitted he was baffled by the footage @entity83 captured			1
he said : ‘ i ’ve looked at the footage and there appears to be four lights in a line intermittently flashing which could be anything			0
‘ but it ’s strange			0
many suspected @entity4 sightings are actually @entity116 lanterns , but it ’s not them this time - no way			2
‘ it ’s very interesting to a researcher like me but at the moment we wo n’t have any answers for a couple of weeks at least when i find out if there were any other sightings or aircraft in the area at the time			0
’ @entity131 spokesman @entity130 said : ‘ it could be a light aircraft or military aircraft , but at 2am in the morning , it ’s unlikely to be civilian			2
‘ we are n’t able to find out what aircraft were in the area at the time , but there was increased activity of northern lights last week , so i suppose they would be a possibility			1
