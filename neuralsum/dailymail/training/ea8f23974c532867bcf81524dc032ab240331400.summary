by @entity0 police dashboard - mounted cameras normally catch the worst of human behavior			1
but one fixed in a patrol car has captured the heart - warming moment an officer took time out of crime fighting to play football with a lonely youngster			1
the officer has been praised for reaching out to the community and helping to engage with the 10 - year - old , who now says he wants to be a policeman or a professional football player			2
posting comments on the police force 's @entity16 page under the video , @entity36 said : ' you guys have got community policing nailed down perfectly			1
play time : the officer leaves his car and asks the youngster to throw him the ball catch : the officer fires off a few of his best throws for the 10 - year - old to catch ' the way you showcase the good work you do should be replicated in forces everywhere			1
too many are too scared to show the human side of the uniform			0
keep doing what you do best ! ' @entity61 added : ' i love it ! ! ! ! i was watching from my office across the street and i was touched ... ' not all of the 449 comments were in praise of the officer 's community engagement techniques , with some accusing him of wasting police time			1
however , @entity72 said : ' i 'm responding to two comments about wasting tax payers money			2
you really need to think about that because the officer just saved you money			0
' the impression this officer left on that young man will last forever			0
praise : within hours of the footage of the officer playing with the lonely child , it had been shared more than 4,000 times across social media community spirit : the youngster says he now wants to be a police officer or a professional football player ' the likelihood of this young man getting involved in crime took a sharp dive down			1
he will look at the police differently and probably not get in trouble which @entity100 will save you money not being in jail wasting your hard earned tax dollars			0
' great job for looking at the future officer 's			2
as for the above two listed individuals , get off you computer , grab a football , walk outside and wait for someone to change your life			0
we are on our way			0
