by @entity0 published : 10:13 est , 17 august 2012 updated : 11:26 est , 17 august 2012 a mystery surrounds the shape of the @entity3 - it is just too perfectly round , say scientists			1
in fact the @entity3 turns out to be one of the roundest objects ever measured			0
scaled down to the size of a beach ball , the difference between the @entity3 's widest and narrowest diameters would be far less than the width of a human hair			1
@entity3 , seen here from the @entity17 spacecraft during an eclipse , could be the roundest object ever measured , stunned researchers have discovered			2
having no solid surface , the @entity3 's rotation should make it slightly flattened			1
but the new measurements show that the flattening is much smaller than expected			0
if the @entity3 was shrunk to a ball one metre across , its equatorial diameter would be only 17 millionths of a metre larger than the diameter between its poles			2
scientists analysed data from the @entity35 satellite which is studying the @entity3 previously it was thought that the shape of the @entity3 varied in cycles , but the new findings show it is remarkably constant			0
lead researcher dr @entity41 , from the @entity42 , said : ' for years we 've believed our fluctuating measurements were telling us that the @entity3 varies , but these new results say something different			2
researchers thought the @entity3 would be slightly flattened as it has no solid surface			0
' while just about everything else in the @entity3 changes along with its 11 - year sunspot cycle , the shape does n't			0
' sub-surface solar forces , such as magnetism and turbulence , may be having a more powerful influence on the @entity3 's shape than was previously thought , said the scientists the research is published in @entity59 , the online version of the journal @entity62 .			1

researchers admit they are baffled by the results
scaled down to the size of a beach ball , the difference between the @entity3 's widest and narrowest diameters would be far less than the width of a human hair
