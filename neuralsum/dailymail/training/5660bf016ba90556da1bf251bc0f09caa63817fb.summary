@entity0 were celebrating an unlikely victory deep in the @entity3 jungle – but for @entity4 it may have come at a price			1
while the tourists were rejoicing in a desperately needed win that closes the deficit to 2 - 1 and breathes life into a side that had been inviting ridicule , their captain was waiting to hear if he would face a one - match ban for @entity0 ’s slow over-rate			1
as @entity17 ran up 242 for eight in a game shortened by a biblical downpour to 35 overs a side , @entity4 ’s team were 18 minutes off the pace			1
fined for the same offence against @entity24 at @entity25 in august , he could now be banned for sunday ’s crucial game in @entity27			0
@entity28 ( left ) and @entity29 shake hands after their unbroken 84 - run partnership helped @entity0 to victory @entity29 clenches his fist in celebration after the much - needed victory in the third odi against @entity17 @entity29 is congratulated by @entity4 after helping to see @entity0 to victory over @entity17 the injured @entity38 tweeted his delight after the @entity0 win ‘ we ’ll plead our case , ’ he said			1
‘ it was tough on that big ground with the ball going everywhere at the end , and it takes a long time for batsmen to come out to the middle			0
’ @entity51 match referee @entity50 may take a different view			0
and if @entity4 is banned for a game , it will raise the question of whether the captaincy passes to @entity57 , who continued his wretched run here by falling on the hook for a single			2
right now , he hardly looks in the frame of mind to score meaningful runs , let alone lead his country			0
@entity0 ’s get - out clause may be that there is no official vice-captain on this tour , in which case @entity29 could come into the picture			1
that , though , is a bridge @entity0 will cross at some point over the next few days			2
for now , they can simply enjoy reacquainting themselves with the unfamiliar scent of victory – only their second in nine completed matches			0
cook himself produced another innings that was neither one thing nor the other , and his 42 - ball 34 ended with a tame drive to the keeper			2
but @entity0 will be quietly thrilled at yet another glittering knock from @entity86 , and with the composure shown by @entity29 and @entity28 after a brief wobble			1
as @entity4 put it : ‘ a side full of confidence would have done it easier than we did			2
’ having raced to 50 in 21 balls during the first warm - up game , @entity86 got there in 25 in the first one - day international , and 29 here			2
if he ’s slowing down , he ’s doing it in style : his innings here included five effortless sixes			0
it helped that the boundaries at @entity102 had been brought in , but this was still carefree batting of the highest order			0
‘ @entity112 that ’s feared ’ has made the transition from a marketing gimmick at @entity108 to a statement of fact at the highest level			0
@entity0 being @entity0 , they almost made a mess of it			2
after @entity4 and his opening partner had put on 84 inside 12 overs , @entity117 – finally given a chance at the expense of @entity120 – was culpable in the run - out of @entity86			1
@entity122 ( second right ) celebrates taking the early wicket of @entity17 opener @entity125 the players were forced off because of bad light and heavy rain , but later returned in a reduced - overs match @entity131 cracks one through the covers for four @entity133 dives to make his ground as @entity4 looks on hoping for a run out @entity133 sweeps one to the boundary as he top scores for @entity17 with 63 the hosts ' captain @entity138 guides one down the legside past @entity0 keeper @entity28 @entity141 performs his customary jump after dismissing @entity138 @entity143 launches the ball into orbit for six near the end of the @entity17 innings @entity148 dives to try to take a catch but the ball just eludes him in the field @entity117 was then caught tamely at mid-on after a promising 27 in 29 balls , before @entity153 – promoted to @entity154 – and @entity57 both fell cheaply to leave @entity0 152 for five			1
@entity29 was caught off a @entity143 no - ball on 40 , but the eventual ease of @entity0 ’s triumph – completed with eight deliveries to spare , with @entity28 rediscovering his touch in an unbeaten 55 from 37 balls – will persuade them they can still get something out of this seven - match series			1
@entity17 ’s innings had been rebuilt from 31 for three by a run - a - ball stand of 87 between two of the world game ’s in - form batsmen , @entity133 and @entity138 , before both fell to the recalled @entity141			1
@entity4 dabs the ball fine past short third man for four as @entity0 start their innings well @entity86 once again takes the attack to the @entity17 bowlers , sweeping to the boundary the @entity0 opener shows his aggressive side as he advances down the pitch and hits out @entity86 attempts an upper cut over the wicketkeeper ( left ) and plays a more conventional drive @entity133 became the fourth player to pass 13,000 one - day runs on his way to a typically classy 63 off 62 balls , before @entity187 and tailender @entity143 helped crash 62 off the last five overs			1
@entity122 picked up three wickets , but @entity153 was again underbowled – sending down only three overs – and @entity192 looked worryingly devoid of rhythm and confidence			0
his two overs cost 28 ; so far in the series , he has sent down six wicketless overs for 64			0
@entity192 played here instead of @entity198			0
it ’s hard to imagine the off - spinner not returning in @entity27			0
@entity0 will head to the capital with an unexpected spring in their step			0
@entity133 and the @entity3 celebrate after running out @entity86 the returning @entity117 hits a six ( left ) but is caught soon after and has to depart @entity29 tries to steady the ship after a flurry of @entity0 wickets in the middle order @entity28 steers the ball through the covers in his superb half - century @entity29 opens himself up and goes inside out over extra cover for four			1

@entity0 beat @entity17 by five wickets ( @entity213 ) in @entity214
@entity4 faces one - match ban for slow over rate
@entity28 hits 55 from 37 balls to see @entity0 home after wobble
@entity29 assists him with 48 from 48 deliveries
@entity86 earlier continued good form with a 40 - ball *58*
@entity133 hit 63 for @entity17 after bad light forced players off
