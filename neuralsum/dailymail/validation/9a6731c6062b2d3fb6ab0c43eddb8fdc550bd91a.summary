@entity0 insisted on a prenup before tying the knot with boyfriend of four years @entity4 wedding dresses and venues might top the list of internet searches for most brides - to - be , but not for @entity0			1
when her boyfriend of four years popped the question , the 33 - year - old wasted no time googling prenuptial agreements instead			1
despite being head over heels in love with @entity4 , 38 , @entity0 , who lives in @entity17 and is originally from @entity18 , had spent years working hard to save for her future			1
and as her heart raced with wedding plans , her head told her to protect her assets			1
' people think of a prenup as something you put in place in case you get divorced but it 's actually a great way to safeguard your assets , ' account manager @entity0 said			1
she got engaged to @entity4 in february 2013 , when he went down on one knee during a trip to @entity35 for a friend 's wedding			0
she continued : ' if you take life insurance out you 're not protecting yourself from death , you 're just insuring yourself in case			0
' like @entity42 and @entity43 – who are both reported to have prenuptial agreements – getting her man to sign on the dotted line before walking up the aisle was non-negotiable for @entity0			1
she thinks @entity48 was wrong for not instigating one before her whirlwind wedding to @entity51 in july 2014			1
' you always think " it will never happen to me " but you just do n't know , ' @entity0 said			1
she continued : ' quite a lot of our friends have prenups in place			2
if you 've put money into property or built up your own career or company , that 's something you should safeguard			0
' @entity0 and @entity4 's prenup was signed a month before their wedding day in @entity35 in january 2014 ( pictured : the couple at their wedding ) if the @entity4 and @entity0 ( pictured ) split up each will keep all of the assets they acquired before their marriage took place so as @entity0 and @entity4 planned their big white wedding in front of 98 guests in @entity35 in january 2014 , they were also busy negotiating how they would split their future possessions			1
' we both always thought prenuptial agreements were a good idea , so we were both in agreement we should get one done , says @entity0 , who is expecting the couple 's first child at the end of march			1
she continued : ' neither of us felt awkward about it at all			0
' ' as well as the house we bought together before we got married , i have a property in @entity18 left to me by my dad , and @entity4 already had a property too			2
' in addition , we both had savings			0
' @entity42 ( left ) has been reported saying a prenup is ' smart ' , @entity95 ( centre ) is said to have one and @entity48 ( right ) reportedly refused to sign one before her marriage to @entity51 the couple used online law firm @entity101 to draw up an official agreement and @entity0 thinks more brides - to - be should consider doing the same			1
a prenup is a legally binding contract entered into before marriage it protects people from losing money and assets it commonly includes provisions for divisions or property or spousal support in the event of divorce a prenuptial agreement is n't legally binding in the @entity119 but will be taken into account during a divorce hearing it is also possible to have a postnuptial agreement after the marriage ceremony has taken place			2
she said : ' you can tailor your prenup to whatever you want it to be , and it also protects you from debt			0
' people think it 's a legal agreement and you need a lawyer but it 's really simple and cheap			0
' we entered our details , declared what our savings and assets are and it gets checked by a lawyer			2
' it cost us £ 25 and took about 20 minutes			0
' in the event of divorce , @entity0 and @entity4 have agreed to split all the earnings accumulated during their marriage by 50 per cent			1
the earnings accumulated before are their own			0
' prenuptial agreements are becoming more and more common these days – it 's like taking out insurance			0
' it has n't impacted our relationship and we do n't talk about it anymore			0
' it 's a good thing to have in place			0
' @entity158 will allegedly receive $ 640,000 ( £ 429k ) for every year he is married to @entity43 if they split @entity42 and @entity160 : @entity42 reportedly gets $ 5m ( £ 3,349,634 ) with each child she bears and would receive $ 1m ( £ 669,926 ) for every year the pair were married if they divorce			2
@entity43 and @entity158 : @entity158 will allegedly receive $ 640,000 ( £ 428,753 ) for every year the couple is married – unless he uses drugs @entity95 and @entity167 : it 's reported that if the @entity170 couple split she will receive $ 2.8m ( £ 1,875,669 ) for every year of the marriage , and if he cheats on her she gets a $ 5m ' bonus ' .			2

@entity0 , 33 , from @entity17 , wanted to protect her assets
she looked into prenups immediately after her boyfriend *proposed*
she says @entity48 was wrong to get married without one
