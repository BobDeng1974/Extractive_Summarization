@entity2 may be something you think you last encountered in an @entity6 plot , but , in fact , the deadly poison can be found all around us , including on our plates			2
a @entity10 dispatches investigation has revealed that many popular rice products — including @entity12 , cheerios and some baby food — may contain potentially dangerous levels of the contaminant			1
this is because rice is grown in flooded conditions in countries such as @entity21 and @entity22			0
the water causes the arsenic that is usually locked up in the soil to be released and this is absorbed by the rice			2
a @entity10 dispatches investigation has revealed that many popular rice products — including @entity12 , cheerios and some baby food — may contain potentially dangerous levels of the contaminant while there are strict regulations for levels of arsenic in drinking water , there are none for food			1
and though levels in rice are n’t toxic in the short term , no research on long - tern exposure has been done			1
the best variety of rice to choose is basmati , which absorbs less arsenic from the soil			0
it is also possible to remove 80 per cent of arsenic from rice in the cooking process			0
the key is to rinse thoroughly before cooking , to boil it in the largest volume of water possible ( which allows the poison to leach out ) and to rinse it again in boiling water after cooking			0
scarily , however , arsenic is not the only poison being served up in our homes			0
heavy metals ranging from lead to mercury can be found in many of our favourite foods			1
why @entity72 cadmium is found naturally in almost all vegetables and wholemeal grains			1
it builds up in the kidneys and can damage them in the long - term cadmium is found naturally in almost all vegetables and wholemeal grains , as they take it in from the soil			1
the metal is a carcinogen as well as a renal toxicant , which means it builds up in the kidneys and can damage them in the long - term , causing kidney disease in extreme cases			1
shockingly , if you eat cadmium today , half of it will still be in your body 40 years from now — it lurks in the kidneys and liver			1
@entity96 , professor of biological sciences at @entity98 , says : ‘ ironically , it ’s people who are living most healthily and who have a vegetarian diet who often have higher exposures to cadmium			2
‘ @entity106 has elevated cadmium in vegetables because of mining , and it is also a concern in industrial areas and allotments in cities			1
’ however , as with food containing arsenic , preparation can limit the impact			2
to get rid of cadmium you should peel — or at least wash — vegetables because much of the contamination comes from soil particles sticking to the outside of produce			1
@entity125 in tuna @entity127 released into the ocean by industrial and mining processes can affect seafood like tuna @entity127 released into the ocean by industrial and mining processes can affect seafood			1
once in the water , it is consumed by fish and accumulates as they are consumed by predators , meaning the creatures at the top of the food chain amass the highest amounts			2
shark , swordfish and tuna are the main dietary sources of mercury , which can have a damaging effect on foetal and child development			0
in adults , it has been associated with depression , tremors , insomnia , headaches and personality changes			0
the metal builds up in the body , particularly in the kidneys and liver			1
the @entity163 advises that children , pregnant women and women trying to become pregnant should not eat swordfish , shark or marlin , and other adults should have no more than one portion a week			0
sweets laced with aluminum sweets can also contain aluminium ( used in food colouring )			1
excess aluminium is deposited around the body , including the brain surprising research by the @entity181 last year said the highest level of aluminium was found in a sample of loose tea			2
tea is grown in acidic soils — which contain relatively high levels of aluminium — and the metal is stored in the leaves			0
sweets can also contain aluminium ( used in food colouring )			1
and it can also be found in water ( purified with aluminium sulphate , which makes micro-scopic impurities clump into particles large enough to be filtered out )			2
every minute , 113,200 aluminium cans are recycled around the world @entity199 , professor in bioinorganic chemistry at @entity201 , has described this century as ‘ the aluminium age ’			0
he warns that excess aluminium is deposited around the body , including the brain , and contributes towards neuro - degenerative diseases such as @entity206 ’s , @entity207 ’s and multiple sclerosis			2
‘ in my opinion , there is no safe level , ’ he says			0
‘ there are levels that may not impact upon health in a lifetime , but these vary between individuals			0
‘ the best thing you can do is take precautions			0
avoid processed food — instead , buy fresh ingredients			0
‘ avoid unhealthy fizzy drinks , particularly those in aluminium cans , as well as energy drinks and iced tea			0
‘ and do n’t buy long - life drinks in those cardboard cartons which contain a layer of aluminium foil			1
’ the doses of lead in pheasants and game wild game , such as grouse , pheasant and rabbit , has been traditionally killed with lead shot			1
tiny fragments can remain in the meat after the butcher has removed these pellets wild game , such as grouse , pheasant and rabbit , has been traditionally killed with lead shot , although less toxic replacements have been introduced			1
tiny fragments can remain in the meat after the butcher has removed these pellets			0
scientists warn that even slightly elevated levels of lead in the body can affect intelligence and behaviour ; in children , it can damage the developing brain			1
the @entity181 says : ‘ there is no agreed safe level for lead intake			0
’ professor @entity96 says : ‘ again , it ’s those who think that they ’re eating the healthiest food — that has n’t been farmed , that ’s wild , that ’s lean — who will be most affected			2
if you ’re having game only once a month , that should n’t be a problem			0
when you have it a couple of times a week , i would worry about it			0
