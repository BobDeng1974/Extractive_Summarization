by @entity0 published : 10:56 est , 23 november 2012 updated : 06:54 est , 21 december 2012 the former owner of @entity2 the elephant was yesterday found guilty of animal cruelty – but walked free from court without even being fined			1
circus boss @entity6 , 70 , was given a conditional discharge for keeping @entity2 constantly chained in her winter quarters and failing to prevent a groom from beating her with a pitchfork			1
his wife @entity11 , 75 , was cleared of the same charges after the judge ruled that she was not an owner of @entity2 and therefore not responsible for her care			1
the couple ran @entity17 where @entity2 ’s ordeal was secretly filmed by animal rights group @entity20			1
guilty : @entity6 , pictured arriving at court today , has received a conditional discharge after being convicted of animal cruelty against @entity25 elephant @entity2			1
his wife @entity11 ( right ) has been cleared of all charges last night @entity20 chief executive @entity27 said the ‘ derisory ’ sentence sent out the wrong message to other animal owners and circuses			1
she said : ‘ despite the considerable suffering caused to @entity2 the elephant , the sentencing meted out to mr @entity6 is derisory and provides no faith that the @entity36 can protect animals in circuses			1
‘ people should be held responsible for the day - to - day experiences of their animals			0
’ @entity6 and his wife left @entity44 magistrates court without commenting			1
@entity2 was brought over from @entity45 in the 1950s and worked for the circus for 50 years			2
she was diagnosed with arthritis , for which she was being treated , in 2003			0
sick : the shocking pictures taken from secret footage filmed by @entity20 show @entity2 being violently beaten around the head , legs and body with a pitchfork and other implements shocking : @entity2 was kicked repeatedly in the footage that was taken inside an elephant shed at @entity59 's winter quarters over a three and a half week period cruel : a keeper prepares to hit @entity2 once more with a stick suffering : the trial heard @entity2 rocked backwards and forwards which , as in humans , is a sign of distress @entity6 and his wife , of @entity68 , @entity69 , each denied three charges : causing @entity2 unnecessary suffering by requiring her to be chained to the ground by one front and one back leg , failing to prevent a groom from beating her , and failing to meet her needs by ensuring she had enough room to move around in			1
the beating was inflicted by groom @entity80 , who is thought to have fled back to his native @entity81 and has never been traced			0
at the end of the five - day trial yesterday , district judge @entity82 said he was satisfied @entity2 was chained for an ‘ excessive ’ period and that caused her to suffer			2
@entity6 , who had health problems , entered the barn only four times during the three - and - a - half week filming period			2
each time @entity2 was chained but he never asked for her to be untethered – and on one occasion supervised the changing over of the chain from one leg to another			2
the judge said @entity6 witnessed @entity2 in chains but ‘ for reasons which he can not explain ’ did nothing about it			1
usually @entity2 was unchained between 11am and 7pm and allowed to wander around in an area of the barn cordoned off by an electric fence in accordance with good practice guidelines			2
@entity106 , march 26 , 2011 the judge said @entity6 failed to exercise suitable supervision of the groom and it was clear the groom was acting under instructions to keep @entity2 chained			1
but he told him : ‘ the real cruelty was inflicted by your groom who acted without your knowledge			0
’ the maximum sentence for each charge is a £ 20,000 fine and six months in jail			0
a ban on keeping animals could also have been ordered but was not			0
the judge discharged @entity6 on condition he does not commit any further offence for three years , and said he took into account that @entity6 has ‘ lost everything ’ as a result of the case and his business is now ‘ effectively at an end ’			2
@entity2 , aged 60 and @entity133 ’s oldest elephant , is now living at @entity134 in @entity135 after the @entity106 intervened to find her a new home			0
thanks to the incredible generosity of our readers , who donated £ 340,000 , she lives in the old elephant house and has access to a paddock and a pool			0
her keepers sometimes take her for walks around @entity134 , when she is feeling up to it			0
saved : @entity2 , pictured last year enjoying her first @entity147 at @entity148 , is thriving in her new home mail readers raised £ 400,000 to help @entity2 live the rest of her life in peace			1
the money was spent giving the elephant a new home at @entity148 , where she moved in april last year			2
funds are also being used to give her a custom - built sanctuary there which will feature a deep water facility , to help her arthritis , and a winter shelter			0
the new enclosure should be ready next year and it is hoped it will become a refuge for abused elephants			0
meanwhile , she is still living a life of luxury in a paddock she shares with the rhinos			0
when she was first rescued , it was feared her arthritis was so bad she would have to be put down			0
but with proper care and attention , her legs improved			0
@entity148 chief executive said @entity2 was ' getting younger by the day '			1
circus : @entity2 was kept her chained up for 24 - hours - a - day and only un-shackled so they could swap which leg she was chained with , a court heard new life : @entity2 now lives at @entity148 in a giant paddock with its own sandpit for her to play in ( pictured ) fragile : @entity2 is 58 and video shown to the jury included footage of her being kicked and poked undercover footage courtesy of @entity20			1
