by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:02 est , 17 september 2012 updated : 18:42 est , 17 september 2012 chiller cabinet : @entity3 , who was promoted to environment secretary in the @entity6 reshuffle , wants to see @entity8 desserts outsell foreign imports environment secretary @entity3 yesterday urged patriotic diners to help close @entity8 ’s ‘ dessert deficit ’ by buying more @entity8 puddings			1
mr @entity3 , who was appointed this month with a brief to kick - start the rural economy , said it was time for @entity8 to ditch fancy foreign dishes			1
he said diners should swap desserts such as panna cotta , crème brulee and tiramisu for traditional favourites like treacle tart , apple crumble and spotted dick			2
in an interview with @entity26 he said there was a ‘ big job to be done ’ in boosting @entity8 ’s food exports and persuading more people in this country to eat @entity8 produce			2
mr @entity3 singled out desserts as an area where there was great scope for ‘ import substitution ’ , if diners could be persuaded to buy @entity8			1
he said he is particularly alarmed at the level of dairy - based desserts which are imported from overseas , at a time when @entity8 farmers are struggling to recover the costs of producing milk			1
‘ there is a huge dessert deficit in this country , ’ he said			2
‘ we have a huge opportunity to replace imported desserts with desserts made here			0
’ @entity51 , chairman of the @entity53 - based @entity52 , which promotes traditional @entity8 desserts , welcomed the intervention			0
‘ i would be delighted if the government wants to put its weight behind @entity8 puddings			2
anything that promotes @entity8 food is a good thing			0
‘ promoting @entity8 recipes and @entity8 products has to be a good thing for our economy - and our tums as well			0
’ @entity8 imports twice as much ice cream as it exports , according to official figures , something the minister wants to reverse the @entity71 does not keep detailed figures on the trade gap in puddings			1
but officials pointed to the dairy sector as a particular cause for concern			0
recent figures reveal that @entity8 imported 115,000 tonnes of ice - cream last year – more than double the 50,000 exported			1
yoghurt imports reached almost 150,000 tonnes – six times the 25,000 sent abroad			1
this summer @entity8 farmers blockaded milk processing plants in protest at the price their received for milk , often lower than the 30p per litre it costs to produce			0
while just two per cent of liquid milk is imported , the level of cheap processed dairy products coming from overseas is much higher			2
he believes if everyone in @entity8 bought a dessert made here they would help to reverse the trend , and provide a welcome boost to the farming industry			0
the great @entity8 bake off with @entity100 and @entity101 has been a uige hit , and reignited interest in old - fashioned desserts the @entity8 is currently a major net importer of dairy desserts , something the new minister hopes to reverse			0
officials at the @entity71 are examining ways to persuade shoppers to buy @entity8			0
it is thought the success of cookery shows like @entity115 will reignite interest in traditional desserts , after a drift towards lighter puddings like panna cotta and sorbet			2
mr @entity3 also revealed plans to increase the amount of @entity8 food sold abroad , saying there ‘ is a big job to be done in exporting			1
former farm minister @entity126 , who was ousted in the reshuffle which saw mr @entity3 promoted to @entity71 , had been spearheading a drive to sell @entity8 pork to @entity130			1
‘ there is also a real job to be done promoting dairy products , promoting food production and adding value , ’ mr @entity3 said			1
‘ more generally , there is a real job for @entity71 to get out of people ’s hair – to help businesses start up and prosper in all sorts of small ways			0
but basically to make it simple , to encourage the kaleidoscope of business ideas across the countryside			0

new environment secretary @entity3 urges @entity149 to be patriotic with their puddings
figures show imports of ice cream are double the amount sold overseas and yoghurt imports are six times larger
