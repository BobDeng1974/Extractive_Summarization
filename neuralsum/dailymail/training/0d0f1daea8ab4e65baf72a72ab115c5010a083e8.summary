@entity0 has accused his opponents of being out of touch with the ‘ wishes of the country ’ , as @entity5 plans to end the meddling of the @entity7 came under ferocious attack			1
the justice secretary faced down criticism of his proposal to allow @entity12 to ignore rulings by the @entity15 court from the @entity16 , @entity19 attorney general @entity18 and former justice secretary @entity17			1
@entity20 went so far as to warn that the @entity21 wished to put @entity12 on a par with @entity23 – which commits human rights abuses and imposes the death penalty			1
@entity0 has accused his opponents of being out of touch with the ‘ wishes of the country ’ meanwhile the @entity7 indicated mr @entity0 ’s plan to restore the sovereignty of the @entity29 and our courts would not be acceptable			1
the @entity32 , which oversees the @entity15 court , said : ‘ as they stand , the proposals are not consistent with the @entity7			0
’ this immediate rejection of the plans will harden attitudes and could push @entity12 one step closer to proposing an exit from the court if the @entity21 win a parliamentary majority in may			1
mr @entity0 , who repeated his threat to quit the echr if @entity15 does not agree to the changes , was defiant			0
the plans provoked fury from civil liberties groups and @entity46 , who was sacked by @entity47 in the summer reshuffle he said : ‘ politicians should reflect the wishes of the country			0
i do not claim to understand why the @entity20 and the @entity16 are opposed to change			1
the vast majority – 80 , 90 per cent of the public – support this change			0
’ as the @entity55 revealed yesterday , the @entity21 will make a manifesto commitment to scrap @entity20 ’s @entity57 and replace it with a @entity12 @entity58			1
instead of being bound by rulings from the @entity7 , it will serve in an ‘ advisory ’ capacity			0
any verdict which was not in @entity12 ’s interests could be rejected by mps in a parliamentary vote			0
as expected , the plans provoked fury from civil liberties groups and mr @entity46 , who was sacked by @entity47 in the summer reshuffle			0
mr @entity18 said it was ‘ laughable ’ that @entity12 would be able to negotiate its own set of rules with @entity15 and criticised the plans as ‘ almost puerile ’			1
he told @entity73 : ‘ i also think they are unworkable and will damage the @entity12 ’s international reputation			0
’ the @entity32 said it was ‘ inconceivable ’ that the @entity12 , as a founding member , could leave the court , he said			2
he claimed the @entity5 proposals ‘ lack any maturity ’ , complaining : ‘ how can the @entity12 obtain such a status when other countries have signed up to an agreement collectively to implement judgments ? ’ but @entity5 sources pointed out that , while he was still serving on the @entity5 front bench , mr @entity18 had appeared to take a different position – supporting the idea @entity63 could vote against the @entity7 ’s demand for prisoners to be granted the vote			1
in 2009 , mr @entity18 said : ‘ the government must allow a parliamentary debate which gives mps the opportunity to insist on retaining our existing practice that convicted prisoners ca n’t vote			0
’ four years earlier , when the verdict on prisoner voting was first handed down , the @entity98 said of the court : ‘ why should they have a say in how that society is run ? ’ mr @entity17 said he found the idea of giving mps a veto on rulings by the court ‘ rather bewildering ’			0
he said the @entity111 government would ‘ welcome the idea ’ that its @entity29 could set them all aside			0
@entity111 membership of the human rights body has continued despite @entity116 ’s arming of separatist rebels and effective invasion of @entity119 this year			2
@entity16 , the @entity16 justice minister , indicated the move was an attempt to counter the threat from @entity123			2
he said : ‘ the conservatives do n’t care about the rights of @entity12 citizens – they care about losing to @entity123			2
these plans make no sense : you ca n’t protect the human rights of @entity131 and pull out of the system that protects them			2
‘ we will not allow the @entity21 to take away the hard - won human rights of @entity12 people when in the @entity12 or anywhere else in @entity138			1
’ there was also anger about @entity20 ’s claim that , if @entity12 no longer falls under the jurisdiction of @entity15 , it will be ‘ in the same bracket as @entity23 , @entity138 ’s last remaining dictatorship ’			1
@entity5 mp @entity145 said : ‘ for @entity20 to suggest @entity12 would descend to @entity23 without their @entity57 shows a wanton lack of moral clarity			1
’ @entity23 is widely condemned as an authoritarian dictatorship with tight restrictions on freedoms of speech , association and regular crackdowns on dissent			0
@entity12 , by contrast , invented modern parliamentary democracy , has a centuries old tradition of civil and political rights and a strong , @entity159 and judiciary .			2
