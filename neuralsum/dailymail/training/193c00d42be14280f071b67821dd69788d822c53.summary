a secret phone recording released on monday shows an @entity4 exec promising @entity5 he would be suspended for just two games , rather than indefinitely , the player 's lawyers claim			1
the audio , obtained by @entity8 , apparently backs up the @entity11 star 's claims that the league promised he would return to the field shortly after pleading no contest to assaulting his four - year - old son			1
instead , six days later , he was suspended without pay until at least april 15 , 2015			2
the audio emerged on monday as the @entity17 filed a federal lawsuit in @entity19 on behalf of @entity5 , asking the court to dismiss the decision to uphold his punishment			1
in the conversation , which was recorded on november 12 , he is speaking on the phone with @entity26 , the @entity4 executive vice president of football operations			1
anger : @entity11 running back @entity5 , pictured last month after pleading no contest for assaulting his son , has said a league exec promised him he could return to the field after just two games at one point , @entity5 says : ' i get two games			1
' ' yeah , ' @entity26 responds			2
the football star continues : ' it will be two additional games , not time served			0
' on tape : @entity26 , executive vice president of football operations , denied making any promises ' no , no , it wo n't , ' @entity26 replies			2
' the one this weekend			0
so really , it 's just next week and you - you 're rolling			0
' again , @entity5 asks : ' two games ? ' ' yeah that is if you - you can not - you got ta just go through the process , ' @entity26 says			1
' i gave my word the other day			0
i think we looked at each other and in my heart i 'm praying that we can just get your family restored and just get you back on the field so you can continue to be the ball player , the citizen , the father , the husband that @entity61 's called you to be			0
' you 've done a lot , paid the price , and i think everybody understands that			0
' before @entity5 's suspension was upheld on friday , the promise was at the crux of the @entity17 argument that he should be reinstated			1
the union claimed @entity26 told @entity5 he would receive the shorter ban if he attended a hearing on with @entity4 commissioner @entity74 on november 14			1
but @entity5 , 29 , declined to meet that day with @entity74 , citing uncertainty about the @entity4 's intent to question him			1
@entity74 then announced the suspension on november 18			0
the union gave the recording to the case 's arbitrator , @entity80 , who oversaw a hearing on december 2			2
@entity26 was questioned , but @entity80 concluded @entity5 was not retaliated against for not going to meet with @entity74			1
not backing off : the decision by @entity4 commissioner @entity74 , pictured announcing new measures for the @entity4 's personal conduct policy last week , to suspend @entity5 indefinitely was upheld on friday ' mr. @entity26 testified that he never promised a two - game suspension or that the old policy would control , but rather encouraged mr. @entity5 to " go through the process and all things will be considered " , ' @entity80 wrote			1
' he said , " i did n't promise @entity5 anything			2
@entity5 needed to show up			1
' @entity5 has been suspended from the league until at least april 15 , 2015 for using a wooden switch to discipline his four - year - old son			1
the boy was left with lacerations across his body			2
the football player , who has six children , pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault in @entity101 on november 4 for probation time , community service and a small fine			0
he acknowledged physically disciplining the boy as he had been as a youth , but he said he meant no harm and was sorry for the trouble he caused			0
' i love my son more than any of you can imagine , ' he said outside the courthouse that day			0
although avoided jail time and a felony conviction , he has been fined more than $ 4.1 million as part of the punishment from the @entity4 - the cost of the six - game suspension			1
on friday , the suspension was upheld as arbitrator @entity80 called it arguably one of the most egregious cases of domestic violence ' in @entity4 commissioner @entity74 's nine - year tenure			1
in response , the @entity17 said it expected the outcome ' given the hearing officer 's relationship and financial ties to the @entity4 '			1
hurt : @entity5 was charged with misdemeanor reckless assault for using a wooden switch to discipline his four - year - old son , leaving him with lacerations ( pictured )			1
@entity5 has apologized determined : @entity5 , who was named as @entity132 in 2012 , has missed six games for the @entity11 this season , meaning he has missed out of $ 4 million in pay			2
he said he is considering retiring from the @entity4 ' the decision itself ignores the facts , the evidence and the collective bargaining agreement , ' it continued			2
' this decision also represents the @entity4 's repeated failure to adhere to due process and confirms its inconsistent treatment of players			0
our union is considering immediate legal remedies			0
' @entity80 's announcement was a decisive victory for @entity74 , whose authority was overruled last month by the arbitrator in the case of former @entity154 running back @entity155			0
@entity155 was reinstated , but he had no team to return to because the @entity154 released him a week into the season			0
the union 's grievance for @entity5 was similar , arguing essentially that @entity74 was making up protocol for discipline as he went along			2
but @entity80 forcefully wrote that he saw no bounds being overstepped by the league boss			0
the @entity11 declined to comment			0
@entity5 has told @entity164 that he might walk away from the game , possibly even trying to run in the @entity166			2
' i 've considered retiring from the @entity4 , ' @entity5 said			1
' i still made $ 8 million this year			0
... i 've thought about going after the @entity168			0
it might be time for me to pursue that			0

@entity5 claims the recording shows @entity4 exec @entity26 promised him he would return to the field within two games
but six days after the conversation , he was suspended indefinitely
an arbitrator concluded that @entity26 told @entity5 he needed to go to a meeting to talk through the matter ; @entity5 did not go to the meeting
the @entity17 filed on monday against the league on behalf of @entity5
