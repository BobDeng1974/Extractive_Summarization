forget chicken fingers and fries — @entity2 and @entity4 's twins prefer much more foodie - approved fare than the average four - year - old			1
in a recent interview , @entity4 , 39 , explained how being a personal chef and graduate of the famed @entity12 cooking school has helped him to influence his children 's culinary tastes			1
' i cook for them a ton ! ' he told @entity18			0
' my kids are crazy eaters			0
@entity42 eats everything that is put in front of him , said @entity4 , but favors clams , sushi , octopus , grilled pork , steak , parmesan cheese , coconut , and spices like ginger , mint , and cinnamon			1
daughter @entity56 , meanwhile , prefers ' very strong and briny flavors ' including oysters , sardines , prosciutto , capers , duck liver , miso , and — not so unusually — chocolate			1
foodie feast : @entity2 commented on this @entity67 picture that his kids were ' devouring oysters at @entity69 ' in @entity70 ; the seafood pick is one of daughter @entity56 's favorite foods impressive tastes : though the twins eat regular ' kid food ' like popcorn , shown here , they also love a lot of dishes that most children their age would n't touch , like ceviche and sardines though @entity4 said that he and husband @entity2 , 41 , do n't usually cook as a couple , with @entity4 himself taking the reins in the kitchen , @entity2 does serve as ' more of the bartender ' when they have company at their @entity70 home			1
the @entity94 star serves cocktails and pairs wine with @entity4 's food , but is also ' a great sous chef ' who @entity4 can rely on to plate food and ice cupcakes			0
it 's natural that @entity4 emerged as the parent who prepares most of the meals in the family ; besides being an established actor , he also trained under star chef @entity107 and runs a catering company called @entity109 , which boasts a long list of celebrity clients including @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , and @entity115			2
couture kids : @entity56 and @entity42 know how to dress up — and strike a pose to show off their fabulous outfits designer darlings : in the caption for this @entity67 photo , @entity2 says his kids are ' giving model poses ' perfect pose : @entity42 smiles big while papa @entity2 says @entity56 is ' a girl , girl , girl ' who likes to be announced like a debutante when she comes down the stairs cuisine is n't the only thing for which @entity42 and @entity56 have discerning tastes , either — though the pair only turned four in october , they 've already developed and eye for fashion			2
dubbing them ' fashionis - tots , ' @entity2 explained on inside the @entity136 that @entity56 in particular has a flair for dressing up : ' @entity56 is a girl , girl , girl			0
she wears mermaid outfits and has falls in her hair and you have to announce her when she comes down the staircase			0
' both of the twins seem happy to get decked out for their dads , as @entity2 regularly posts photos of the adorable duo in impeccably - styled outfits on his @entity67 account .			0

@entity4 says daughter @entity56 and son @entity42 have incredibly *sophisticated* tastes
the 39 - year - old actor has worked as a personal chef and attended @entity12 cooking school
@entity42 eats everything , while @entity56 favors ' strong ' flavors and ' anything chocolate '
though @entity4 is the cook in the family , @entity2 is good at plating the food
