disability campaigners yesterday demanded new laws for wheelchair users after judges ruled they have no legal priority to use reserved areas on a bus			1
appeal judges said that a mother with a baby buggy was within her rights to occupy a bus wheelchair bay , leading to a disabled passenger being left behind at the stop			2
the state - funded @entity14 , which had brought the case of disabled passenger @entity17 to court , said : ‘ this judgment means a wheelchair user has no effective legal rights if unable to gain access to a bus because a traveller blocks the designated wheelchair space			1
’ bus companies do not have to force parents with pushchairs to make way for wheelchair users on buses , the @entity26 has ruled			1
it comes after an appeal by operator @entity35 , which had been ordered to pay £ 5,500 damages to wheelchair user @entity17 ( pictured ) mr @entity17 was denied access to a bus in february 2012 after a woman with a sleeping baby refused to move its disability commissioner @entity40 added : ‘ the @entity14 will study the judgments before deciding whether to support an appeal for legislative changes to make sure disabled people can use bus travel			1
’ the case came after mr @entity17 was told he could not board a bus after a woman refused to move her buggy and make room			1
a judge at @entity53 ruled the bus company , @entity35 , was in breach of its duty under the @entity57 to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people , and awarded £ 5,500 damages to mr @entity17			1
but this decision suggested the needs of wheelchair users ‘ trumped all other considerations ’ , one of the appeal judges said yesterday			1
lord @entity67 , sitting with @entity68 and @entity69 , said there was no law which says bus companies must force selfish passengers to make space for a wheelchair			0
instead , they ruled that the ' proper remedy ' for wheelchair users to get improvements in such cases is to ask @entity81			1
but @entity68 , sitting with @entity82 and @entity69 at the @entity26 ( pictured ) , unanimously allowed an appeal by @entity35 common decency meant other passengers should move from the wheelchair space ' if that was possible ' , or drivers should instead ‘ persuade ’ passengers to do the right thing			1
but , in law , the needs of wheelchair users did not ' trump all other considerations '			1
lord @entity67 said : ' the judge seems to me to have thought that the needs of wheelchair users trumped all other considerations			2
mr @entity17 , 36 , from @entity96 , @entity97 , tried to catch the number 99 to @entity99 in february 2012			1
the driver asked him to wait before getting aboard because a woman with a pram was in the wheelchair space , and asked her to fold the buggy			0
she replied that the buggy did not fold , and refused to move			0
the driver then left mr @entity17 behind because he did not think there was a safe place to secure his wheelchair on the bus			1
lord @entity67 said the case was ‘ not about whether non-wheelchair users should move out to accommodate a passenger in a wheelchair			2
of course they should if possible			0
’ drivers should instead be taught to pile pressure on selfish passengers , @entity68 said			0
they should even refuse to move off from the stop if passengers block disabled customers , she added			0
lord justice @entity69 said : ' it has to be accepted that our conclusion and reasoning in this case means that wheelchair users will occasionally be prevented by other passengers from using the wheelchair space on the bus			1
the judges ruled that common decency meant other passengers should move from the wheelchair space ' if that was possible '			2
but , in law , the needs of wheelchair users did not ' trump all other considerations ' ' sometimes there will be a reasonable justification for that happening , but sometimes there will not			2
' i do not , however , believe that the fact that some passengers will - albeit rarely - act selfishly and irresponsibly is a sufficient reason for imposing on bus companies a legal responsibility for a situation which is not of their making and which they are not in a position to prevent			0
' in the present state of the law something must still be left to the good sense and conscience of individuals			0
' @entity68 added : ' it follows from the judgments of this court that the proper remedy for wheelchair users is to ask @entity81 to strengthen the powers of bus drivers so that they could , for instance , require people to vacate the wheelchair space , or create new duties on other passengers , or to campaign for a different design of buses			1
' in that way , a greater number of wheelchair users would be able to use the wheelchair space			2
' the judge said she did not underestimate the difficulties of travel for wheelchair users ' or their frustration at the pace of change '			2
february 24 , 2012 : @entity17 , was prevented from travelling on a @entity35 bus to @entity99			1
the driver refused to make a mother with a pushchair leave the space because it would wake up her baby september 2013 : a judge at @entity53 ruled the ' first come first served ' policy was unlawful discrimination in breach of the @entity57			1
@entity35 was given six months to change its policy november 2014 : @entity193 , for @entity35 , appealed against the ruling , claiming it was an example of a long - running problem on public transport that had produced conflicting court decisions and bus operators were now seeking legal clarity			2
december 2014 : @entity68 , sitting with @entity82 and @entity69 , said there was no law which says bus companies must force selfish passengers to make space for a wheelchair			0
drivers should instead ' persuade ' passengers to do the right thing			0
the judge added : ' it is obvious that , as one wheelchair user has said , for them the world was not built with a ramp			2
' however the only question the court had to answer was whether it would be reasonable for the @entity35 bus company to have to adopt the policy in favour of wheelchair users proposed by mr @entity17			1
the judge said the answer to that question ' in the current circumstances is no '			0
mr @entity17 , from @entity96 in @entity97 , attempted to board the bus to visit his parents in @entity99 on february 24th , 2012			1
but he was told to wait for another when the woman with the pushchair refused to move because her baby was asleep			2
a judge at @entity53 ruled that @entity35 's policy of ' requesting but not requiring ' non-disabled travellers , to move out of the space if it is needed by a wheelchair user was in breach of the @entity57			1
he awarded mr @entity238 £ 5,500 damages			1
lord @entity67 said that mr @entity17 has asked to appeal to the @entity241 , but the judges refused permission to appeal			1
he added that he felt it was up to the @entity241 to decide if they felt it was ' appropiate ' to take the case			0
mr @entity17 's case was funded in court by the @entity14 , mr @entity17 described how on february 24 2012 he tried to board a number 99 bus at @entity96 to @entity99 to take a train to visit his parents at @entity253			1
he said : ' somebody got there just before me and put a pushchair in the wheelchair space			0
the bus driver asked her to leave , but she refused so i was not allowed on the bus			0
' i ended up missing my train and arriving at my parents an hour late			0
' mr @entity17 added : ' we are saying it is a reasonable adjustment for a bus company , as a service provider , to insist wheelchair space be made available if needed			1
' mr @entity17 said that he might appear to be ' a confident guy ' coming to court to fight for the rights of the disabled			1
but the problems posed by getting access to public transport ' impact on my confidence quite a lot '			0
he said : ' it is a question of not only not knowing whether you are going to be able to get on to a bus but whether there is going to be some conflict			0
' @entity285 conflict is not very pleasant			0
it is one of the many stresses of getting around in a wheelchair			0
' campaigners for young disabled people said the ruling ' can only worsen the situation , particularly for those in rural areas who may heavily rely on bus services			0
' @entity301 , speaking for the @entity298 , a network of young disabled people , said : ' we are frustrated and extremely disappointed by this decision , which means that wheelchair users do not have priority , in law , over wheelchair spaces on those buses that they are actually able to board			2
' travelling by public transport with a young child and buggy can be difficult and stressful - as a mother myself i am all too aware of this			0
however , the reality is that even today , many disabled people already find themselves unable to rely on public transport to commute to work , get to school or college or to travel to vital appointments like hospital visits			0
' the @entity324 's transport network , buses , trains and taxis alike , is still widely inaccessible and unpredictable , often leaving disabled people facing long delays and hugely increased journey times			0
this ruling can only worsen the situation , particularly for those in rural areas who may heavily rely on bus services			0
' we will be closely monitoring how young disabled people are affected by the court 's decision and the next steps needed to ensure the rights of wheelchair users are protected			2
