it is said that women are from @entity2 and men from @entity4 , but the debate as to whether men and women ’s brains really are different rages on			1
tonight it is the subject of @entity12 ’s @entity11 , which will feature a number of experts arguing that male and female behaviour is driven by biological differences , and others claiming it is caused by social conditioning			1
the programme looks at the latest research - from into whether hormones in the womb make a developing foetus ' brain more ‘ masculine ’ to how children naturally prefer to play with gender ' appropriate ' toys			1
it will include the latest research about whether hormones in the womb make people ’s brains more ‘ masculine ’ and analytical , as well as men and women ’s tolerance to pain clasp your hands together interlocking your fingers and look at which thumb is on top			1
if your right thumb is on top , it suggests that the left half of your brain is dominant			0
the left hemisphere is associated with logic , analysis , facts and verbal ability and is viewed as being more masculine			0
if your left thumb is on top it suggests that the right half of your brain is dominant			0
some studies suggest that a dominant right hemisphere of the brain makes a person more creative , intuitive and adept at analysing emotions - ' feminine ' traits			0
all humans use a mixture of both hemispheres			0
this experiment forms part of a larger @entity12 quiz examining how the brain works			2
professor @entity73 of @entity74 , whose research will be examined in the programme , believes there are two different brain types : ‘ empathisers ’ who are good at reading what people are feeling , and ‘ systemisers ’ who are best at analysing situations			1
all humans are a mixture of the two , but men tend to be stronger systemisers than women , who are largely better empathisers , dr @entity86 explained			2
this perhaps helps reinforce the stereotype that men are better at reading maps , while women are more adept at reading people ’s emotions and multitasking			1
professor @entity73 ’s latest research suggests that this is a result of exposure to hormones in the womb , and not social conditioning , the @entity12 reported			1
for his latest study , he followed a group of children from birth for 12 years			0
at 16 weeks gestation , samples of fluid in the womb were taken and the levels of testosterone in it measured			2
size matters ? a recent study by the @entity74 showed that men and women 's brains are biologically different when it comes to differences in grey matter			1
areas of larger volumes in women are marked in red and areas of larger volume in men are in blue professor @entity73 found that the higher the testosterone in the fluid , the slower the child was to develop socially and showed less empathy at primary school			1
however , children exposed to higher levels of testosterone in the womb , displayed better spatial awareness and analytical abilities , which are traditionally seen as masculine traits , he argues in tonight ’s programme that male and female brains consequently develop differently , without gender influences imposed on children			1
another recent study by the @entity152 will come under the spotlight			1
researchers scanned the brains of 949 males and females between the ages of eight and 22 and found that male and female brains were wired differently			0
men showed stronger connections between the front and backs of their brains than women			1
professor @entity166 of the university said that the connection means that men are ‘ better able to connect what they see with what they do , which is what you need to be able to do if you are a hunter			1
’ the study also revealed that women have stronger wiring between the right and left hemispheres of the brain , which makes people with more feminine brains better at multitasking and reading people ’s emotions			1
dr @entity86 said that more research into the differences in male and female brains could lead to gender - specific medication ( stock image ) however , professor @entity192 believes that differences in how men and women behave are largely down to social conditioning – how children are treated at a young age			1
she is concerned that claims that women ’s brains are biologically different to men ’s could discourage females from pursuing careers in science and engineering			1
‘ we live in a country where fewer than three out of ten physics a levels are taken by girls , where just 7 per cent of engineers are women … and where men still earn on average nearly 20 per cent more than their female colleagues			2
’ dr @entity218 , who presents the programme , told @entity220 that culture undoubtedly plays a role in shaping whether people behave in a certain way , but said that he believes there are real differences in the brains of the two sexes			1
an experiment was specially conducted for @entity11 , which involved experts giving monkeys a choice of ‘ male toys ’ such as cars and ‘ female ’ toys such as dolls to play with			0
they found that the male monkeys were naturally drawn to the cars , while the female monkeys automatically opted for the dolls			0
researchers say it is natural for females to be drawn to the dolls because female primates raise their young , but they are not sure why the male monkeys wanted cars			0
dr @entity247 said that new research into male and female brains could be used to develop the next generation of painkillers that are gender - specific			0
some experts believe that men and women process pain differently			2
for example men respond better to @entity255 than women when in pain because drugs are typically tested on male animals , many drugs better suit men , but new pills could be tailored to women			2
horizon : is @entity264 ? will be broadcast tonight ( september 29 ) on @entity12 at 9pm			2
dr @entity218 ( pictured ) , told @entity220 that culture undoubtedly plays a role in shaping whether people behave in a certain way , but said that he believes there are real differences in the brains of the two sexes experts are divided as to whether male and female brains really are different			2
neuroscientist professor @entity274 says the sexes are not ‘ hardwired ’ in different ways and there is no evidence that men are innately better at reading maps or that women are better at multi-tasking			1
any difference is due to society ’s idea of gender , not to biology , and is deterring a generation of women from becoming scientists , she warns			2
professor @entity274 , of @entity291 , @entity292 , said differences in the brain are formed in childhood by divisions in the games girls and boys play and stereotypes they conform to			0
she told the @entity301 in @entity292 last month : ' we really can not afford to sit back and accept the “ essentialist ” view that girls are not going to be interested in science subjects because of some “ brain deficiency ”			0
‘ we need more trained scientists and engineers but 50 per cent of our pool of talent is not engaging			0
‘ people who could study these subjects or do these jobs are choosing not to			0
this must not be explained away by misguided and misleading explanations in terms of unchangeable biological characteristics , or references to “ the natural order of things ” ’			0
her views - for which she has been labelled a ‘ gender difference denier ’ - are contradicted by a prominent study published last year			0
the study , in which the brains of 949 young men and women were scanned at the @entity152 , suggested that women had better connections between the left and right - hand sides of the brain , while men had better links between the front and back			1
the authors claimed their findings demonstrated that women are better disposed to deal with ‘ analytical ’ and ‘ intuitive ’ tasks at the same time			0
men , meanwhile , were better at complex motor skills , they said			0
professor @entity274 dismissed the study as having neglected the idea that these changes were caused by nurture - not nature - and said there is no such thing as a ‘ hardwired ’ brain			1
‘ there is quite a lot of thoughtless science being done and quite a lot of overenthusiastic presenting			0
if you just look at gender differences - and not their experiences in life - then yes you might find differences			0
‘ but the brains of men and women are much more similar than they are different			2

debate is the subject of @entity12 @entity364 , which airs tonight at 9pm
programme will look at whether hormones in the womb make people ’s brains more ‘ masculine , ’ as well as men and women ’s tolerance to pain
research from @entity74 suggests higher levels of testosterone in the womb leads to the development of a more masculine brain
another recent study showed that men have a stronger connection between the front and backs of their brains , leading to better spatial awareness
professor @entity192 thinks differences between the sexes are down to social conditioning and biological claims put women off becoming scientists
