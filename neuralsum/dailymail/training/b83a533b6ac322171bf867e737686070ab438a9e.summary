@entity8 , mp for @entity9 in @entity10 since 2010 , avidly reveals the views of @entity12 and @entity13 on everything from their ‘ @entity16 ’s ’ time - keeping to what ’s in the newspapers			1
in october , she even found time to record the cats ’ supposed reaction to her own pronouncement on the nation ’s drug laws			0

@entity12 and @entity13 also show their jealous side , apparently			2
next to a picture of ms @entity8 with a group of trainee guide dogs is the message : ‘ @entity16 ’s been cheating on us ! ! we are giving her the silent treatment until at least teatime			2
’ ms @entity8 , 38 , who is single and a qualified football coach , hit the headlines in 2011 when she was banned from the commons soccer team – because she was a woman			2
a former aide to senior conservative @entity49 , ms @entity8 began posting the @entity5 messages from her cats ’ perspective earlier this year , after picking @entity12 and @entity13 from a cats ’ home			1
ballot box : @entity13 curls up in a cardboard box the @entity5 diary contains only veiled references to ms @entity8 ’s day job at @entity59 and says it is about ‘ a troublesome two with a @entity16 who rules elsewhere but not at home			1
' we rule this house			0
’ this has n’t stopped @entity12 and @entity13 boasting that their names have appeared in @entity67 , the official record of @entity70 proceedings , after ms @entity8 mentioned them during a parliamentary debate			1
but ‘ @entity16 ’ @entity8 and her cats also have their fallouts			2
