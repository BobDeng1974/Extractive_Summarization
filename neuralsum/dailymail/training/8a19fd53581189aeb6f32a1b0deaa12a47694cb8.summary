@entity0 are close to agreeing the second biggest @entity2 shirt sponsorship ever with @entity3			1
a £ 25million - a - year deal is expected to be finalised by @entity5			1
the negotiations with the big spending airline , famous for its @entity9 and @entity10 adverts , were first revealed by @entity11 last september			2
the money would be a significant advance on the £ 18m - a - year @entity14 currently pay to have their name on @entity0 shirts and would propel the club above @entity18 and @entity19 in the @entity2 shirt sponsorship table			1
but the west @entity34 club , already deep in talks with @entity3 before former @entity18 chief executive @entity36 was brought in to revamp the commercial operation , still lag well behind @entity38			1
the @entity40 shirt sponsorship with @entity41 , that began this season , is worth £ 53m annually			1
@entity43 have had their shirts sponsored by @entity3 in the past spreading their wings : @entity3 linked up with @entity38 @entity46 could end up spending just 20 days a year presenting racing on @entity47 when she finally agrees a new contract to accommodate her other broadcasting options			1
that would mean @entity46 ( below ) hosting only the @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			2
meanwhile @entity56 , racing @entity58 ’s combative presenter , who resigned from the @entity59 after being criticised at an awards lunch , is on the broadcaster - of - year shortlist despite only @entity59 members being eligible			1
@entity46 could end up spending far less time presenting racing on @entity47 when she agrees terms @entity67 plan to end live video streaming of the post-executive committee meeting press conferences because of the pounding that president @entity70 subsequently receives on social media			1
strangely , online ridicule has not dissuaded @entity70 from standing for a fifth term next may			2
meanwhile , it looks like the pr agency who get the job of helping @entity67 in the build - up to @entity79 2018 — @entity80 are favourites — will face a tough task			1
the video launching the tournament logo has already stirred up trouble by showing the disputed @entity87 peninsula as part of @entity79			0
@entity67 were angry but the @entity89 were said to be very relaxed			0
@entity90 , much to the angst of its rugby production team , will give commentary priority today to @entity38 v @entity95 , a run - of - the - mill @entity2 match			2
@entity99 ’s test against @entity100 is relegated to 5 @entity101			0
however there have been assurances that @entity105 and @entity106 games will be back on @entity90			0
shaky start for @entity108 the @entity110 ’s choice to succeed commercial director @entity111 , who brought in $ 1billion worth of tv rights and sponsorships , has already ruffled a few feathers			0
@entity108 allegedly made an insensitive comment about committing suicide while on a panel at the @entity118			0
@entity108 was responding to a @entity120 representative who admitted he was depressed about falling attendances and participation			0
there were more than 200 people at the event , but an @entity110 spokesman claimed they heard nothing untoward			0
the @entity99 team are on tour in @entity130 and held a two - minute silence for @entity132 on saturday the @entity134 offer to the @entity135 to win the right to host next year ’s @entity106 included an £ 80million guarantee and half of the 2.3m tickets being sold by the @entity135 to competing nations , sponsors and corporate hospitality			1
so although @entity144 ( @entity143 ) 2015 have only 140,000 of their allocation still to shift , tens of thousands of seats are likely to be returned by the @entity135			0
that will leave er 2015 to sell the returns at late notice — some for supposedly sell - out matches			2
the gloves are off already in the battle for the @entity154 presidency between @entity155 and @entity157 ’s @entity156 , even with the election not due until next august			0
@entity156 suspects the only way he can win is to fight dirty with his camp planning to use every opportunity to highlight conflicts @entity155 might have through his many varied roles .			0

the @entity166 ' shirt sponsorship deal with @entity14 is set to come to an end
@entity0 have been sponsored by @entity14 since 2005
@entity3 are set to be their new shirt sponsor
a £ 25million - a - year deal is expected to be *completed* by @entity5
this would be a £ *7m* advance on what @entity14 currently pay
