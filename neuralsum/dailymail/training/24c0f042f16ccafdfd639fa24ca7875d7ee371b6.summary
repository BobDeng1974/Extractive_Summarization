@entity0 is set to return to the @entity2 next season with @entity4 and @entity5 likely destinations			1
the @entity7 striker is sick of the racism he suffers in @entity9 and it is understood the former @entity12 star realises life in @entity14 was not so bad			1
@entity4 are in talks with @entity16 to sign @entity17 but will talk to @entity0 ’s ‘ people ’			1
@entity5 will move in for @entity0 if @entity19 is lured away to @entity16 or @entity20 after the @entity21			1
sensational return ? @entity0 could be back in the @entity2 with @entity5 or @entity4 @entity23 was straight back into action on saturday night after he lead @entity25 into the @entity2			1
i understand @entity23 wants to lure out - of - contract veterans such as @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 to @entity34 next season			1
in what is set to be @entity23 ’s final year as a top - flight manager he feels bringing in older star players - with no fees but big wages - is the best way to stabilise a club which has debts of £ 117million and keep them in the @entity2			1
back in the big time : @entity23 celebrates @entity25 's promotion to the @entity2 targets : veterans @entity32 ( left ) and @entity33 are wanted by @entity23 at @entity25 it ’s a big ask but @entity23 has powers of persuasion			1
@entity23 hopes to make sure that @entity52 , on loan at @entity50 in the past season , remains at the club			1
@entity54 are confident they will complete the signing of @entity57 striker @entity56 next week in a £ 32million deal			1
@entity33 is wanted by @entity59			1
as reported here in january , he has been released by @entity54			0
@entity5 are also keen but @entity30 has told friends he is reluctant to move one of @entity54 ’s rivals			1
that could see the former @entity14 left back take a one - year deal at @entity66 , where he could help @entity69 bed down			1
@entity69 , out of contract , is in talks with the @entity73 club for whom his father @entity74 played from 1995 to 1997			0
@entity76 wants a new £ 300,000 - a - week deal to stay at @entity12			1
@entity76 ’s ‘ people ’ believe he should be on at least the same wages @entity79 at @entity80 united , if not more			1
that is why , they launched a @entity84 campaign last week			2
city want to retain @entity76 but my source tells me they wo n’t be bullied into offering the 31 - year - old a new mega deal			1
@entity90 , unloved by @entity91 , is 33 - 1 to be top scorer at @entity21			2
@entity93 are considering offering @entity94 the job as @entity97 ’s successor			1
@entity98 is also on @entity93 ’s radar after they were turned down by former striker and club legend @entity100 on saturday night			1
@entity102 are set to make a new offer for @entity105 ’s @entity104			0
the @entity102 will try and get @entity106 back from @entity109 club @entity107 for the first few months of the new season			2
mon : @entity111 formally appointed as new @entity113 manager			2
it ’s then said @entity115 will take over in three years			0
i say why not now ? tues : stories emerge that @entity118 is about to open a chain of pubs			0
i say i ’m gutted there are still people living off @entity118 ’s fragility			0
weds : @entity76 does n’t want a new contract , he just wants a birthday cake			1
if not he is ready to take a pay cut and move to @entity20			0
and the issue has nothing to do with money			0
thurs : @entity20 are not interested in toure friday : @entity76 wants a new contract with @entity12			1
but the situation for a £ 220,000 - a - week player has nothing to do with money			1
it was shocking to see how @entity0 was racially abused by local ‘ fans ’ at @entity9 ’s pre @entity21 training camp in @entity139			1
sadly it was hardly a surprise			0
only a few years ago a prominent @entity73 sports writer who originated from @entity144 explained to me that many @entity146 @entity73 still regard anyone south of @entity148 as an @entity149 and , like it or not , @entity142 remains a romantic figure in the eyes of many			0
@entity153 has become a forum for many ‘ ultras ’ in @entity9 to express their views			0
even if , as the recent @entity160 and local elections have exposed , there is an upsurge is xenophobia in this country , football has moved along way from the darks days when racism was rife on the terraces and the game has been at the vanguard of breaking down race barriers in this country over the past quarter of a century			0
yes , in recent seasons there have been some unsavoury and awkward high - profile incidents but in general the @entity176 game is more cosmopolitan and inclusive than in most countries			2
yet if @entity180 can return to the political highway then there is no room for complacency , because as @entity185 once told me it ’s not necessarily what people say , it ’s what they think when it comes to down to racism			0
shocking : @entity0 was racially abused by @entity9 fans at a @entity192 training camp in @entity139 and lest we forget that @entity185 once had to back heel a banana back into the @entity195 stands and as recently as the @entity197 finals was , like @entity0 , the target of racist taunts from @entity14 followers			1
@entity201 , who would emerge as a key player at @entity197 , recalls in his book tackles like a ferret a training session in @entity206			0
manager @entity207 had opened the doors to let some of the fans who had arrived on the island early but it became an open invitation for a hardcore group of @entity215 followers to hurl abuse at @entity185 and @entity201 and chant ‘ @entity218 ’ songs			2
a year earlier it beggared belief that a group of 20 who did not disguise their allegiance to the @entity215 ( now @entity224 ) had travelled all the way to @entity226 for an @entity14 b match seemingly with the sole purpose of targeting @entity201			2
as he remembers : ‘ it was so cold in @entity231 that two players , @entity233 and @entity234 , needed cold showers to warm up from the effects of hypothermia but it was the abuse i received from the @entity215 which made my blood freeze			0
proud : @entity201 ( left ) represented @entity14 with distinction despite at times being abused by his own fans ‘ why these people had come all the way to @entity226 i would never understand			2
they gave @entity118 some stick for being too fat but that was genial enough			0
‘ in my case it was non-stop anti-black abuse and as i was the only non-white player in the team it was as if they had travelled for the specific purpose of abusing me , such was its intensity and persistence			0
‘ i just had to get on with the business of playing , pretending it had nothing to do with me			0
’ in many ways @entity197 the following year proved a turning point , not only in terms of reviving the @entity176 game but ousting the racist bigots			0
the way things were : @entity185 famously backheels a banana thrown at him at @entity195 in 1988 by the time @entity14 had reached the semi-finals , the majority of decent fans had drowned out the @entity215 hardcore who were eventually driven out when the authorities took their actions more seriously			2
the fact that players such as @entity185 and @entity201 took such pride in wearing the white shirt and @entity14 crest was also a major factor			2
@entity79 has , at the age of 28 , said this @entity21 is his last shot at the international big time			0
did he say that when he wangled a new £ 300,000 - a - week four - year deal from @entity113 in january ? i once argued that @entity79 could be @entity14 ’s @entity286			1
but i know why that has n’t happened			0
he has n't kicked on : @entity79 could have been @entity14 's @entity286 but is n't playing in the right position @entity79 can be @entity14 ’s best asset in @entity291 but he has to be deployed in the right position			1
where is that ? starting from the wing			0
next week i will explain why – thanks to the great man @entity296 ( rip )			2
why do @entity102 seem to think that appointing a ' striker coach ’ will solve their problems			0
how can a ' striker coach ' alter the attacking ethos of the manager still wants to play @entity302 ? the only solution i can think of is an old pal of mine called @entity306			2
forward thinking : @entity306 ( centre , in the 1988 league cup final ) would be ideal as @entity102 's ' striker coach ' so @entity310 set to stay at @entity4 and the word is he has £ 100m to spend on new players			0
but last year he had a £ 120m warchest and did n’t really use it			0
@entity310 , time to stop putting the foot on the ball and kick one hard … so push out the boat and buy back @entity318 and @entity319			0
bring them back : @entity310 should try to re-sign @entity318 ( left ) and @entity319 for @entity4 most in the media seemed beside themselves last week that a ‘ head doctor ’ , sorry sports psychologist , is a key member of @entity14 ’s @entity21 squad			1
it is now written that dr @entity327 can give @entity14 the edge			2
really ? his last two clients , @entity5 and @entity331 , both flopped when it came to the crunch .			0

former @entity12 star @entity0 wants *transfer* back to @entity14
@entity25 boss @entity23 wants @entity29 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity31 and @entity30 after promotion to the @entity2
@entity59 are also interested in @entity33
@entity12 wo n't be bullied into £ 300,000 - a - week @entity76 deal
@entity93 want @entity94 to succeed @entity97 as manager
