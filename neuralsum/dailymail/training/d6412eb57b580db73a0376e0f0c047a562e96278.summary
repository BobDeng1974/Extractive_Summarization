by @entity0 published : 18:53 est , 26 november 2013 updated : 10:22 est , 27 november 2013 the @entity1 has launched an unprecedented call for an army of ‘ @entity4 ’ to look in on lonely elderly neighbours and make sure they are coping this winter			1
it has issued a call for 100,000 volunteers to sign a pledge committing to visiting older people to check they are warm and have everything they need			1
the new @entity16 pledge is being backed by the @entity17 , which has been running a @entity18 for the @entity19			1
a host of celebrities , including @entity22 and @entity23 , have already signed up			1
celebrity backing : @entity23 ( left ) and @entity22 have already pledged their support for @entity16 last winter , there were an estimated 31,100 excess deaths due to winter conditions – a 29 per cent increase on the previous year			1
most are over 75 and the majority of the deaths are entirely avoidable			1
hundreds of thousands of others spend much of the winter alone and lonely			1
the @entity1 appeal comes a month after health secretary @entity35 said @entity36 should be ashamed of the way it treats grandparents and urged families to take a leaf out of the book of @entity44 nations , where they take more responsibility for elderly relatives and do not leave caring to the state			1
surveys have found more than half of over- 75s live alone and five million older people say tv is their main form of company			2
one study found the lack of social connections is as likely to cause early death as smoking 15 cigarettes a day			2
last winter 81 - year - old stroke victim @entity60 starved to death after the local council failed to send round home helps for nine days			1
@entity63 , 88 , who has regular visitors @entity65 , 88 , has lived alone on a quiet street in @entity67 since losing her husband @entity68 to a heart attack 15 years ago			2
the former interior designer ’s remaining family live in @entity72 and are too busy to see or speak to her			2
worse still , 14 years ago a fall down a flight of stairs badly injured @entity65 ’s back , leaving her reliant on a mobility scooter to get around			0
desperately lonely , @entity65 spent months at a time barely leaving her house , let alone speaking to anyone else			1
‘ i have never felt so isolated in my life , ’ she recalled			1
‘ i would cry a lot			1
i was just watching the television , listening to the radio and sleeping			0
i was desperate for company			0
it just went on and on			0
’ finally , four months ago @entity65 called the charity @entity85 that helped alert her neighbours to her predicament			1
@entity89 lives opposite and helps @entity65 with her shopping and @entity91 lives around the corner and tidies her house once a week			0
both make time for a cup of tea and a chat			1
‘ waking up and knowing i ’m going to see someone even for half an hour has changed my life , ’ she said			1
‘ i ’m happy again			1
the last few winters have been awful ; it ’s always dark and the nights last forever when you are on your own			0
this is the first time in years i ’m not dreading @entity104			1
’ in january , a nurse from a care agency visited stroke victim @entity60 , 81			1
@entity60 depended on these visits four times a day for food , water and medication as she lived alone in @entity113 , @entity114			0
her husband , @entity115 , an accountant , died in a car crash 30 years ago and they had no children			0
after giving her some spaghetti and fruit juice the nurse left @entity60 watching television			0
nine days later a district nurse visited by chance – and discovered the agency that had been looking after @entity60 had closed down and no one had checked on her			0
@entity60 was found severely dehydrated , suffering kidney failure , with serious bed sores and only a faint pulse			0
her walking frame was out of her reach and she had been unable to call for help			0
sadly , she died in hospital 11 days later			0
and earlier this month , hundreds attended the funeral of @entity136 , a 91 - year - old war veteran , after an appeal for mourners in a local newspaper revealed he died with no close friends or relatives			1
the campaign is being led by the @entity144 website and seeks to help by appealing to an old - fashioned sense of neighbourliness			1
the @entity1 suggests that people could agree to check in once a week , or more if it turns very cold			1
they could check the person ’s home is warm enough , make sure they have enough food , offer to pick up prescriptions , clear the snow in front of their house , or offer to take them on a walk			1
those who sign the @entity16 pledge will receive free cold weather alerts and email tips throughout the winter to help them do their bit			1
one of the first to sign was @entity167 , who said last night : ‘ a little help really does go a long way			1
you will also find , i ’m sure , that giving a bit of your time in this way is hugely rewarding			2
’ @entity23 , host of @entity174 , said : ‘ isolated , vulnerable and elderly people are the most at risk			1
it ’s a tragedy when most of these deaths could be avoided , so that ’s why i ’ll be tweeting my support for the @entity183 pledge			1
’ other celebrities supporting the campaign include former weather girl @entity186 , @entity188 gold medallist @entity187 , actors sir @entity189 and @entity191 , presenters @entity192 and @entity194 , and rapper @entity195 by @entity197 attitude : @entity199 believes the impulse to take care of others is still there - we just need to nurture it the man must have been in his early 80s			1
he shuffled towards the bar of the pub , placed his coins down and asked for a pint of beer			0
i watched as he tried to strike up conversation with the young barman , who barely lifted his eyes from the till			0
rebuffed , the old man slowly made his way back to his table			0
the day before i ’d felt the same pang when i witnessed the bus conductor drumming his fingers as an elderly woman struggled to get off			2
and again , when another octogenarian was met by indifference as she tried to exchange pleasantries with a supermarket cashier			0
most of the time we are too wrapped up in our own lives to notice this kind of exchange			2
but when an elderly person close to you becomes dependent – as my mother did when she developed dementia – you realise how lonely old age can be			2
social isolation in old age is no trivial matter			0
recent studies indicate that lack of social interaction is as likely to cause early death as smoking 15 cigarettes a day			0
that ’s why the @entity245 campaign is so valuable : it reminds us there are plenty around us for whom a friendly face and an offer of help is hugely important			2
it could even mean the difference between life and death			0
like most modern families , we did n’t think of moving my mother in with us when she was diagnosed in 2008			0
we tried to supply all her needs by regularly visiting her and hiring her a carer			0
but , even with this , she was often at risk alone , and it was easy to see how losing any of those props would have resulted in isolation			0
before her illness , i – like most of us with busy jobs – was guilty of not giving elderly neighbours enough thought			2
not only do you become more aware when a loved one is in the same boat , you also begin to realise the value of the small acts of kindness			0
condemned : last month health secretary @entity35 said @entity36 should be ashamed of the way they treat grandparents i saw the huge difference some people made to my mother ’s life – neighbours who checked up on her , a caretaker for her block of flats who stopped to share a joke			1
these tiny deeds cost nothing but make a huge difference			2
of course , those who are still able to get out and about are relatively fortunate			0
there are plenty more who are housebound			0
i have elderly neighbours who do not have family nearby , who can no longer get out and can not access even the fairly minimal help available			2
there is one couple in their 90s who , although they have each other , rely on one or two neighbours to do their @entity307 was another			0
she is now dead but for many years she was my next door neighbour and eventually could not get down her steps			2
sadly , she spent most of her last years alone in front of the television			0
a recent survey reveals that 51 per cent of all people over 75 live alone and five million elderly say the television is their main form of company			2
there are plenty who are entirely isolated – and this becomes all the more difficult when winter @entity323 many of her thrifty generation , my mother was prone to turning off all the radiators in her house except the one she was sitting beside			2
@entity327 did the same , often barricading herself into one room and remaining static by her gas fire			0
thankfully there were neighbours to check on them both , but what if there had n’t been ? by signing up to @entity335 , you can help make sure that that is not the case for vulnerable elderly people living near you			1
and you ’re not burdening yourself with an unachievable commitment – you ’ll simply be doing your bit when the weather is cold by looking in on an elderly friend or neighbour , checking radiators are on and food is in the cupboards			1
i believe the impulse to take care of others is still there – we just need to nurture it			0
after all , one day it might be you .			0
