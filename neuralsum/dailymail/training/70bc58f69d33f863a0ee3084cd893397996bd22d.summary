by @entity0 published : 11:08 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 11:11 est , 8 august 2013 babies born by caesarean section have lower levels of healthy bacteria in their guts , experts believe			1
a study suggests babies born in theatre have lower levels of some types of bacteria which are naturally passed from mother to baby during a normal delivery			1
this may put babies born by @entity18 at higher risk of some conditions , such as allergies , due to implications for the immune system			1
babies born by caesarean section have lower levels of healthy bacteria in their guts , experts believe writing in the journal @entity29 , researchers from @entity27 assessed gut bacteria in 24 babies , of whom nine were born by @entity18			1
they examined samples when the babies were one week old and again at one , three , six , 12 and 24 months after birth			0
blood samples were also taken to test the immune response of the babies			0
the results showed that those delivered by caesarean section , and who therefore did not pass down the mother ’s birth canal , lacked one of the major groups of gut bacteria , the @entity47 , or acquired it late when compared with babies born vaginally			1
in some babies born by @entity18 , @entity47 did not appear until a year after birth			2
the total range of bacteria among babies born in theatre was also lower			2
the experts said : ‘ microbial colonisation of the infant gut gastrointestinal tract is important for the postnatal development of the immune system			0
the lower levels of good bacteria may put babies born by @entity18 at higher risk of allergies ‘ in this study , caesarean section - delivered infants who are not entering the birth canal of the mother either lacked or displayed a delayed colonisation of one of the major gut phylum , the @entity47			1
‘ the colonisation of this phylum was delayed by up to one year for some infants			0
the total microbiota diversity was also lower in the caesarean section infants , probably largely as a consequence of the lack of this phylum			0
’ bacteria are important for prompting the immune system to respond to triggers and to not overreact as is the case in allergies , diabetes , and inflammatory bowel disease , the experts said			1
the results had nothing to do with whether the mother had received antibiotics to help prevent infection			0
the gastrointestinal tract of newborn infants is considered to be sterile in the womb , the authors went on			0
‘ bacteria from the environment , mainly from the mother , colonise the infant gut immediately following birth , ’ they said			2
bacteroidetes do not appear to grow outside the gut and ‘ hence need to be transmitted between human hosts ’ .			0

some types of bacteria are naturally passed from a mother to her baby during a normal delivery
babies born by @entity18 have less of these bacteria
this puts them at risk of allergies , diabetes and inflammatory bowel diseases
