@entity0 has admitted @entity2 ’s play has been left ‘ a little broken ’ by the significant overhaul of their squad this summer			1
the @entity2 manager , who believes victory in saturday ’s @entity8 derby will belatedly launch a season that has failed to get started , made nine new signings during the last transfer window , as well as selling @entity12 to @entity13			1
such a significant transition in personnel has seen @entity2 lose three of their first five @entity16 matches , with their performances being characterised by poor defending , and @entity0 is aware of how standards have dropped from last season ’s dazzling brand			1
@entity2 manager @entity0 speaks to his players during a training session at @entity24 on thursday @entity2 are missing striker @entity12 ( top ) who they sold to @entity13 for £ 75million this summer @entity12 scored 31 league goals for the @entity27 last season and @entity0 admits his absence has been a setback @entity31 has been brought in to replace the @entity32 but will need time to fully settle in that is why he believes @entity2 need to get back to the basics that served them so well last term and he has been encouraged by the squad ’s willingness to learn from their mistakes			1
‘ i think at this moment in time we are re-focusing and reintroducing principles into our game that has brought the win ratio we ’ve had in the last 18 months , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ apart from the @entity48 game ( won 3 - 0 ) we have moved away a bit from that			2
‘ our game is based on fast pressing , a real high intensity and also the speed of our football			2
we put a lot of hard work in during the first six months that we were here and a lot of those processes became natural — the consequence of that is winning			2
@entity2 have lost three of their five @entity63 matches and sit in a lowly 11th position ‘ when you introduce a raft of new players and lose the core of players , that ’s obviously a factor and then it becomes a little bit broken			1
that ’s how our game has looked for me for a big part of the season			2
where i am fortunate is that i have a group of players here that identify with that			0
‘ we are all in this together and we need to get back to re-focus on what has allowed us to win games consistently over the last 18 months to two years			2
that has been about the way we play and imposing our style and strength on our opponents			0
’ beating @entity88 , though , would provide a significant boost ahead of next tuesday ’s @entity91 trip to @entity92 and @entity0 recognises it could dramatically alter the perception of his new arrivals if one were to score a winning goal			1
the expensive £ 25m summer signing @entity100 ( left ) has made a slow start to his @entity103 career new signing @entity104 ( left ) was substituted after just 22 minutes at @entity106 following a poor display ‘ @entity109 games give you a chance to be a hero and the players here are well aware of that , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it ’s a massive game to the supporters , a very special game			0
but it ’s also for me about getting back to performing well			0
it ’s important we get a victory and that will give us confidence			0
’ if @entity0 has issues to contend with so does @entity88 manager @entity124			1
he accepts his side ’s defending has not been good enough , while he also feels @entity88 need to clear a mental barrier tomorrow , as it has been 15 years since they last won at @entity103			2
the @entity27 have been missing the injured @entity128 , but he could return against the @entity88 @entity0 ( right ) gets his point across to @entity2 's players in training on thursday prior to playing @entity88 @entity124 said : ‘ i think the psychology is a very important point because if you look at the stats , 15 years without a win at @entity103 , then it needs to be a bit more than football			1
it ca n’t always be a football reason why you have n’t won a game over that period			0
‘ so i ’ll accept that			0
we are ready to go anywhere			0
i ’m not highlighting @entity103 as a place we do n’t look forward to			0
i think the mentality of the group is to go anywhere and focus on our performance			0
‘ will it be a difficult game ? of course			0
they are in a position where they need to perform well at home and get points , but i do n’t see that psychologically we are not ready to go to @entity103 and be ourselves , that is the answer to the question			0
@entity124 has seen @entity88 suffer an even worse start to the @entity16 season than @entity2 @entity162 will hope to secure @entity88 's first victory at @entity103 for 15 years video see both @entity12 goals for @entity165			1
