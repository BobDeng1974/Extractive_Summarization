by @entity0 few images can beat those of @entity3 from space , which can display its magnificent vortices , stunning colours and abstract patterns in a way we rarely see			1
but its beauty can also highlight some of the world ’s problems including pollution , desertification , urban sprawl , farming and natural disasters			1
in this series of images , @entity20 - based environmental activist @entity19 aims to explore some of the world ’s biggest environmental and sociological challenges using satellite imagery			1
these rows of oppositely spinning vortices , caused by the unsteady separation of flow of a fluid around blunt bodies , can be seen over the @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35			2
this phenomena is known as @entity37 compiled as part of his book , @entity3 from @entity41 , mr @entity42 probes scientists and activists on how satellites can draw attention to some of these problems			1
among the images is one of the @entity53 delta that is notable for its stunning red and blue patterns			1
but beneath its beauty the satellite picture reveals the devastation the @entity58 oil rig caused in april 2010			1
an explosion on the semi-submersible drilling unit killed 11 workers and injured 16 others			2
it caused the @entity58 to burn and sink , resulting in a massive offshore oil spill in the @entity65			1
the @entity53 delta in 2010 after the explosion of the @entity58 oil rig			1
@entity68 indicates plant cover , while white and blue represent the water			0
increased reflection on the surface , due to oil slicks , appear as a brighter white @entity76 , the @entity77 's sludgy estuary , reached six miles on @entity79 's west coast			2
@entity35 stretch out in the direction of the current and are covered by mangrove trees , seen in red in this image			0
in the surrounding area , the cleared forest gives way to brush and cassava and rice plantations the image was released months after the explosion of the @entity58 oil rig			1
oil slicks increase reflection on the surface and therefore appear as brighter white			0
it reveals the extent to which hydrocarbon pollution penetrated the delta 's marshlands , which are so rich in biodiversity			1
mr @entity42 , who is also an environmental activist , arranged the scenes pictured in his book into themes including pollution , desertification , urban sprawl , farming and natural disasters			1
another image shows @entity76 , the @entity77 's sludgy estuary , reached six miles on @entity79 's west coast			2
@entity35 stretch out in the direction of the current and are covered by mangrove trees , seen in red in this image			0
in the surrounding area , the cleared forest gives way to brush and cassava and rice plantations			0
grid patterns of fields and pastures surround the whirlpools created by the @entity53 , the largest hydrographic basin in @entity129			2
a number of oxbow lakes are shown as the river moves south of @entity133 the @entity134 is @entity136 's most powerful river			1
stretching for more than 550 miles ( 900 km ) , it flows into the @entity138 through a vast delta that juts far into the sea			2
@entity142 alluvium and an ingenious system of irrigation channels favour rice plantations , notably the famous bomba rice the @entity147 flows north for over 2,800 miles ( 4,500 km ) through @entity149 @entity148 to the @entity150			0
as the @entity152 enters the ocean , it divides into many channels and forms a large delta			2
the @entity157 satellite took this image in july 2000 impressive phytoplankton blooms are also seen from space off @entity162 ’s @entity161			2
most phytoplankton are too small to be individually seen with the unaided eye			0
however , when present in high enough numbers , they may appear as a green discoloration of the water			0
phytoplankton plays an important role in the ocean 's carbon cycle by removing half of all co2 from the atmosphere during photosynthesis and storing it deep under the sea			0
recent research has revealed that water temperature has a direct impact on maintaining the delicate plankton ecosystem of our oceans			0
the new research means that ocean warming will impact plankton , and in turn drive the cycle of climate change			0
other images include that of the @entity134 , @entity136 's most powerful river , the @entity193 dividing @entity194 and @entity195 , and the urban sprawl of @entity197			1
mr @entity42 also recently directed two films for the @entity200 : the film @entity202 , official film of the 2011 @entity204 , and the film desertification			0
both were screened during @entity207			0
the @entity193 is a 1,790 km ( 1,110 mile ) long river in @entity209 that forms the border between @entity194 and @entity195			1
in the @entity211 ( c. 800 ce ) , the @entity193 restored contact with the @entity138 world with the establishment of the trans - saharan trade route @entity197 , the ' automobile capital of the world , ' lies west of @entity217 and the @entity218 these impressive phytoplankton blooms as seen from space are shown off @entity162 's @entity161			1
most phytoplankton are too small to be individually seen with the unaided eye			0
however , when present in high enough numbers , they may appear as a green discoloration of the water @entity227 is a large bay , about 120 miles wide , indenting the coast of @entity230 in @entity231			0
it was discovered by captain @entity233 in two airplane flights from his expedition vessel , the @entity236 , in 1931			0

@entity19 has compiled these stunning satellite images as part of his book ' @entity3 from @entity41 '
include one of the @entity53 delta that reveals the devastation the @entity58 explosion caused in 2010
other images include that of the @entity250 's most powerful river - the @entity193 dividing @entity194 and @entity195 , and the urban sprawl of @entity197
