not many sides , if any , could lose their first - choice goalkeeper and replace them with a @entity4 and @entity5 winner			2
but @entity7 manager @entity6 was able to hand @entity8 only his second league start of the season — with no 1 @entity11 struggling with a fractured finger — in their win against @entity15			1
the club were keen to stress the injury sustained by @entity11 in their defeat to @entity20 would not have prevented him starting the match , but they were in the position of having a world - class player in reserve			1
@entity8 was between the sticks for the @entity7 against @entity15 with @entity11 left on the bench @entity7 's veteran goalkeeper @entity8 made a number of important saves against @entity15 were it not for @entity8 , who until this summer had been first - choice for a decade , @entity7 could easily have been behind before @entity29 and @entity30 scored either side of half - time to secure an awkward victory			1
@entity15 dominated the first half and when @entity35 was through on goal @entity8 flung himself low to save a shot that looked destined for the bottom left corner			1
@entity6 fielded £ 12.5million defender @entity39 with @entity40 struggling with the volume of games over the busy festive period			0
the club are confident of their squad depth after planning last summer to compete for the @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity46 and @entity47			0
‘ we have great faith in our squad , ’ assistant manager @entity48 explained			0
‘ when it was assembled at the start of the season it was with the objective to compete for all four titles			0
‘ that means it ’s a 60 - plus match season , which means you need a pool of players , 11 is not enough			2
the @entity15 game was a case of utilising that pool			2
’ meanwhile , @entity6 endorsed counter-part @entity65 , who has been in temporary charge of @entity15 since @entity68 left for @entity69 , during an exchange on the touchline			1
young @entity72 keeper @entity11 was left on the bench due to a minor finger injury @entity29 passed the @entity75 ahead with the minimum of fuss at @entity78 on saturday afternoon @entity30 looked delighted when he added a second for @entity7 just before the hour - mark but @entity65 is yet to win in his three games in charge			1
they drew 3 - 3 with @entity84 and were beaten by @entity85 in the @entity46 before saturday ’s defeat			0
he predicts he will know if he has got the job on a permanent basis in a fortnight , adding : ‘ what you have to bear in mind is that we ’ve got @entity95 next saturday , then we are not playing the following week because we ’re out of the @entity46 so there is a little bit of time there			0
‘ it ’s been two weeks now , so by that time comes round it will be a month			0
that is a long time to get ready to decide what you are going to do , so i think it should all be in place by then			0
’ @entity109 stat : @entity7 have won all 10 home league games this season and scored at least twice in each .			1

@entity7 beat @entity15 2 - 0 at @entity78
@entity29 and @entity30 both scored for the hosts
