there will be a fresh sense of optimism in and around the @entity3 on saturday lunchtime as @entity5 take on @entity6 in the latest blockbuster @entity9 clash			1
the sight of @entity11 , their £ 16m deadline - day signing from @entity15 , scoring twice for @entity16 in their @entity18 opener with @entity19 will have gladdened the hearts of the @entity5 faithful			1
the striker looks revitalised by a change of surroundings and a new challenge , ready to feed off the ammunition supplied to him by @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			0
but in order to return the title to north @entity61 for the first time in a decade , there is one thing that must change , starting this weekend			0
@entity5 's recent record against their title rivals is very poor ; their last 30 matches against their fellow incumbents in the top four have yielded just seven wins and 18 defeats			1
they have collected a meagre 26 points out of a possible 90 during this five - year period against the big boys			0
@entity6 put six past @entity5 shortly before @entity74 last season , denting their title hopes @entity34 can only look on in dismay as @entity78 celebrates @entity6 's fifth goal in the rout @entity5 also suffered humiliation at the hands of @entity83 , losing 5 - 1 at @entity84 last season @entity5 have finished in the top four for each the last five @entity9 seasons , unlike their rivals @entity87 , @entity15 , @entity6 and @entity83 , who have all had at least one season outside the @entity91 places			1
but even with just 30 matches played against their rivals , their points - per - game ratio is the worst			0
@entity87 have fared best in the big games , winning 17 out of 32 against teams that finished that season in the top four			0
one thing that might cheer up @entity5 fans is that their rivals @entity103 have a worse record in the big games ... source : @entity107 @entity47 does n't know how to react as @entity83 score one of their five goals last season @entity87 thrashed @entity5 6 - 0 in march this year as the @entity111 ' woeful record against their rivals continued their cause was not helped when referee @entity114 erroneously sent off @entity115 the tv companies have not done @entity5 a favour in scheduling their match with @entity6 for 12.45pm			1
the @entity111 ' biggest beatings last season - 3 - 6 at @entity6 , 1 - 5 at @entity83 and 0 - 6 at @entity87 - were all 12.45pm starts			1
it is this inability to beat their nearest challengers on a regular basis that is making the difference between finishing first and finishing fourth , and @entity34 knows he need to address it			0
last season was a prime example - @entity5 were flying high when goals from @entity30 and @entity29 saw off @entity83 at the @entity3 in november and it genuinely looked like their year			2
they were thumped 6 - 3 by @entity6 , 5 - 1 by @entity83 and 6 - 0 by @entity87 away from home , ultimately finishing fourth - enough to secure @entity91 football for the 17th consecutive season but a disappointing return given they led the table until february			2
@entity5 's 8 - 2 loss at @entity15 back in 2011 ranks as the worst of their big - match losses @entity34 cuts a lonely figure as @entity5 are taken apart at @entity138 in august 2011 @entity139 celebrates with the tv camera after scoring for @entity103 in the october 2011 derby the season before , they failed to pick up a win against @entity15 , @entity6 and @entity87 - the three sides who finished above them			1
in 2011 - 12 , they were thrashed 8 - 2 at @entity138 and also lost on the road to rivals @entity103 and @entity6			2
these defeats in big matches are disastrous and have been going on too long			0
the fear factor must be overcome and there 's no time like the present to make the change			0
@entity5 face @entity6 on saturday , play @entity103 at home on september 27 and then travel to @entity87 on october 5			2
this is a team packed with quality , they need to make a big statement against their title rivals			0

@entity5 take on @entity6 in the @entity9 on saturday

@entity34 knows this must improve if they are to challenge
£ 16m striker @entity11 is in line to make his @entity5 debut
