before last summer 's race , potholes and cracks in the village of @entity12 were smoothed over to provide the elite cyclists with the best surface			1
before the race potholes in @entity12 were filled and smoothed to provide cyclists with the best surface			1
but now residents claim they have been left with an accident blackspot - and the road has been closed initially villagers were delighted , but after the cyclists left they soon realised that the surface of @entity23 was so smooth cars were sliding across it as they rounded the bend			1
now they say the lane has turned into an accident blackspot which they describe as ' deadly ' and lethal '			1
and after a series of crashes highway chiefs seem to agree - as they have used emergency powers to shut the lane			2

i slammed on the brakes but the wheels locked , it was just like being on black ice			0
there was nothing i could do			0
