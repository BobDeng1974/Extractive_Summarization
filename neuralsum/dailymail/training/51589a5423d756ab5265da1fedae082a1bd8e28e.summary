by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @entity2 @entity3 can not bear to talk about last season ’s injury - blighted campaign – but the @entity7 striker is backing himself to prove sceptics wrong this time around			1
at £ 22million , the @entity9 was labelled one of the flops of the season having returned just three league goals following his move from @entity15 last summer			1
fitness problems restricted him to only seven starts in all competitions and the suspicion was he would be sold during the close - season			1
out to impress : @entity3 is hoping to impress @entity21 after a nightmare first season at the club sidelined : @entity7 striker @entity3 missed large chunks of last season due to injury but manager @entity21 has publicly backed the 24 - year - old and handed him a start during sunday ’s 2 - 0 win at @entity31			1
the @entity32 insists @entity3 has a future with the champions , and the player is determined to come good on that faith			1
‘ i do n’t want to speak about last year , ’ he said			2
‘ i just want to look to the future			0
i am happy to be here and i know that i am going to be an important player for this club and i am happy to be a part of this team			2
‘ of course , i am expecting so much from me this season , i expect to score so many goals			1
’ shooting for goal : @entity3 , who faces stiff competition for a first - team spot , expects to score more goals second season : @entity3 ( centre ) joined @entity7 alongside @entity51 ( left ) and @entity52 ( right ) @entity3 is set to rotate in attack along with @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity51 , although he could keep his place for monday ’s visit of @entity58			1
and he added : ‘ we have a very good team			2
there is great competition for places with @entity54 and @entity55 and @entity51			0
‘ they are all there and we have to do our best and at the end , who is the best in that moment will play			0
‘ it was nice to start the first game			0
i am very happy because i played and we did a good job			0
also , @entity55 came in and scored			0
‘ we are now looking forward to @entity58			0
i ca n’t wait for it			0
