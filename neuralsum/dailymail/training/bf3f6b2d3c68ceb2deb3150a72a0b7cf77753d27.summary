by @entity0 the @entity2 satellite is expected to meet its fiery death in the next few days as it plunges to @entity4 - but no one knows where it will land			1
the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) has been in its low @entity8 for an extra two - and - a - half years on its planned mission			2
about 40 tonnes of manmade space debris reach the ground per year , but the spread and size mean the risk of an individual being struck is lower than being hit by a meteorite			1
after more than four years on its mission , the one - tonne goce satellite will fall rapidly through the atmosphere , burning up as it descends			2
in an update earlier this week , the @entity48 said @entity2 was at at an altitude of 192km , having run out of fuel on 21 october it added that the spacecraft is still fully functional with good attitude control			0
' interesting days may lie ahead , as several coronal mass ejections ( @entity55 ) are expected to reach our planet , which may spark storms in @entity4 's geomagnetic field and hence lead to a large increase in the atmospheric drag at @entity2 's altitude , ' said @entity2 operations manager @entity63 in a blog post			1
this is the first uncontrolled re-entry of a @entity66 ( @entity66 ) satellite since 1987			1
at a height of 224km , @entity2 's orbit is so low that it experiences drag from the outer edges of @entity4 's atmosphere			1
the satellite 's streamline structure and use of electric propulsion system counteract atmospheric drag to ensure that the data are of true gravity			1
while most of @entity2 will disintegrate in the atmosphere , @entity66 expects that around 25 per cent might reach @entity4 ’s surface			1
when and where these parts might land can not yet be predicted , but the affected area will be narrowed down closer to the time of re-entry			0
taking into account that two thirds of @entity4 is covered by oceans and vast areas are thinly populated , the danger to life or property is very low			0
the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) has been orbiting @entity4 since march 2009 at the lowest altitude of any research satellite			1
during its mission , it has produced a unique model of the ‘ geoid ’ , which is essentially a virtual surface where water does not flow from one point to another			0
during its mission , @entity2 has produced a unique model of the geoid , which is essentially a virtual surface where water does not flow from one point to another			0
the colours in the image represent deviations in height from an ideal geoid			0
the blue shades represent low values and the reds / yellows represent high values around mid-october , the mission will come to a natural end when it runs out of fuel and the satellite begins its descent towards @entity4 from a height of about 224km			2
re-entry is expected to happen about three weeks after the fuel is depleted			0
an international campaign is monitoring the descent , involving the @entity125			0
the situation is being continuously watched by the @entity66 ’s @entity48 , which will issue re-entry predictions and risk assessments .			2

@entity2 has spent 4 years mapping @entity4 ’s gravity with *incredible* *precision*
@entity133 will be the first uncontrolled re-entry of an @entity66 satellite since 1987
the risk of an individual being struck is lower than being hit by a meteorite
around 25 per cent of the satellite 's parts are expected to hit @entity4
