an army of airborne drones could soon be used to bring mobile phone signal and wireless internet access to the remotest parts of the @entity5			1
@entity5 ’s biggest mobile phone group @entity6 has begun working on the technology , which it hopes to deploy by the end of the decade			1
using unmanned drones to broadcast phone signal to rural communities is cheaper than erecting traditional masts , it says			0
@entity6 has revealed its manifesto to improve network coverage in the @entity5 as part of its signalling the future manifesto			1
they want more than 99 per cnet of the country to have @entity23 by 2017			1
by the same year 90 per cent of the @entity5 will also have access to double - speed @entity23 , accomplished using unmanned drones and balloons the devices , called @entity29 , are still at an early stage of development			1
but early plans indicate they will be able to fly 0.6 miles ( 1km ) into the air in order to pick up signal from masts up to 12 miles ( 20km ) away			0
@entity6 has announced that it plans to spend £ 1.5 billion ( $ 2.3 billion ) upgrading its 4g network across the @entity5			1
by 2017 the company wants to ensure that its services are extended , especially rural areas , with the goal of giving more than 99 per cent of the country access to @entity23			1
to do so , they will use tethered - balloons and drones to reach remote areas , such as setting up temporary @entity23 areas at music festivals			1
their ‘ @entity51 ’ manifesto is designed to tackle the @entity5 ’s changing digital infrastructure needs			2
this will include a @entity55 programme to vastly improve voice and data services for the @entity5 ’s countryside areas			1
and they plan to supply more than 90 per cent of the population with access to double - speed 4g by the same year , capable of speeds of up to @entity63			1
and so - called 4g + , faster than regular @entity23 , will be rolled out to the 20 biggest @entity5 cities by 2017 , with speeds of @entity66			1
they will then beam this signal into the area below it , allowing villages below to make mobile phone calls and access the internet			0
this avoids the need to expensive cables in the ground and base stations			0
the drones would work in pairs in order to ensure that one was always airborne			0
each one can hover in one spot for hours , but when it lands to recharge , the other would take its place			0
it is likely they would be forced to land during periods of bad weather , meaning that communities would be without access in storms			0
but @entity6 thinks this would be more efficient , as it would not be forced to send teams to repair masts damaged by weather			0
‘ in the @entity5 , there are still many places where you ca n’t make a phone call , ’ said chief executive @entity6 said			2
‘ we want to solve that			0
’ he said the company ’s aim with the project was to ‘ radically improve mobile coverage , this time with a strong focus on rural parts of the @entity5 ’			2
it comes as part of the company ’s pledge to spend £ 1.5 billion ( $ 2.3 billion ) over the next three years to expand its network			0
this will allow it to offer superfast @entity23 internet speeds to 90 per cent of the country			2
the devices , called @entity29 , are still at an early stage of development			0
but early plans indicate they will be able to fly 1km into the air in order to pick up signal from masts up to 20km away			0
they will then beam this signal into the area below it , allowing villages below to access the internet ( stock image of drone shown ) as part of its £ 1.5 billion ( $ 2.3 billion ) plans to upgrade its 4g network across the @entity5 , by 2017 the company wants to ensure that its services are extended , especially to rural areas , with the goal of giving more than 99 per cent of the country access to @entity23 ( stock image shown ) under its plans , which are still in an early stage of development , the company wants to use flying drones in areas it would be too expensive or too difficult to lay cables			1
while companies such as @entity154 and @entity155 are developing balloons to broadcast internet to remote parts of the world , @entity6 ’s scheme would be the first time unmanned drones will be used to provide mobile signal			1
as well as rural areas , the company could use the drones to provide mobile access for areas that host short - term events , such as music festivals or sporting events			2
it is also exploring the possibility of using weather - style balloons as well as drones to provide mobile signal			2
@entity6 is currently in the process of being bought by @entity179 in a £ 12.5 billion ( $ 19 billion ) deal			0
but the company insists that it will continue to develop the technology after the takeover is complete .			0

they want more than 99 **%** of the country to have @entity23 by 2017
by the same year 90 **%** of the @entity5 will also have access to double - speed @entity23
