by @entity0 @entity1 : 13:20 est , 16 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:25 est , 16 december 2013 archaeologists have discovered remains suggesting that cats have lived with humans far longer than was previously thought			1
cats were believed to have been domesticated 4,000 years ago in @entity8 but bodies found at a dig at a village in @entity12 in central @entity14 date back 5,300 years			1
dr @entity15 , of @entity16 in @entity17 said analysis including radiocarbon dating of bones suggested the cats preyed on rodents that lived on farmed millet			0
@entity14 farmers may have domesticated cats more than 5,000 years ago to protect their grain			1
pictured , a @entity27 , native to @entity29 and @entity30 the team analysed eight bones from at least two cats excavated from the site			0
one of the cats had old bones - suggesting it had survived well into old age in the village			2
another was shown to have eaten fewer animals and more millet than expected , suggesting it had been fed by the villagers			0
cat remains found at a dig at a village in @entity12 in central @entity14 date back 5,300 years dr @entity49 , who studied the site with scientists from @entity14 universities , suggested that the cats were domesticated to control the villagers ’ rat problem			1
the archeologists also found an ancient grain pit , with thick walls that rodents had managed to dig through , demonstrating the scale of the infestation			0
‘ our data suggests that cats were attracted to ancient farming villages by small animals , such as rodents that were living on the grain that the farmers grew , ate and stored , ' she said			1
‘ results of this study show that the village of @entity73 was a source of food for the cats 5,300 years ago , and the relationship between humans and cats was commensal , or advantageous for the cats			2
‘ even if these cats were not yet domesticated , our evidence confirms that they lived in close proximity to farmers , and that the relationship had mutual benefits			1
’ dna studies suggest that most of the estimated 600million domestic cats around the world today are descendants of the near eastern wildcat , which still lives in northern @entity30 and the @entity93			0
the discovery has left archaeologists puzzling over whether the @entity14 cats had been imported from the @entity93 , or whether they were a completely different breed			0
speaking of the latest find , dr @entity49 said : ‘ we do not yet know whether these cats came to @entity14 from the @entity100 , whether they interbred with @entity14 wild cat species , or even whether cats from @entity14 played a previously unsuspected role in domestication			2
’ cats have lived alongside humans for a very long time , but when and where they were tamed remains a mystery			1
previous evidence suggested they were first domesticated in ancient @entity8 , where they were kept some 4,000 years ago			2
more recent findings point to a much earlier association with humans , including the discovery of a wild cat buried with a human nearly 10,000 years ago in @entity119			0
most of the estimated 600 million domestic cats now living around the world are known to be descended most directly from the @entity27 , one of five wildcat sub-species still found in the @entity125			0
one of the cats was found to have a diet featuring food provided by - or scavenged - from humans the remains were found in the @entity12 province of @entity14 ( file picture )			1
analysis of bones from at least two cats uncovered at the site showed that they preyed on grain - eating animals , probably rodents			0

cat remains discovered in @entity12 hint cats helped farmers protect *crops*
one of the ancient cats had a diet suggesting it ate human food
when and where cats were domesticated is a mystery
