by @entity0 published : 18:44 est , 20 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:15 est , 20 february 2014 miss g , whose identity has been kept secret by a judge , says she may be crippled with a metal knee , but knows how to look after herself and does n't want the state interfering in her life a frail spinster of 94 has asked a high court judge to stop her local council interfering in her life and leave her in peace at her £ 350,000 home			1
a two - day hearing was told social workers and police were sent to her house 12 times in nine months to investigate if her private live - in carers looked after her properly			1
the case was brought by the council which believes her decisions are unduly influenced by the carers , a married couple			1
they may now be removed from her home			2
social workers asked the judge to decide if the spinster had mental capacity to decide on her financial affairs and living arrangements			1
but the pensioner , a retired @entity37 midwife identified only as miss g , told the judge : ‘ i am a grown woman			1
i know who i want to live in my home and who i choose to stay there with me			2
‘ i am crippled with a metal knee but i can manage my own affairs			0
nobody tells me what to do			0
i do n’t want these people from the council persecuting us			0
it is malicious interference in my business			0
referring to her carers , identified as @entity54 and mrs c , she added : ‘ we are a family together and we want to live in peace			0
’ the hearing was made open to the @entity59 after @entity60 gave the judge a signed statement asking for ‘ the names of myself and the council which has brought these legal proceedings made public			1
‘ i would also like it known that my express wish is to remain in my own home , with my current 24 - hour carers , and without social services intrusion			1
’ miss @entity60 asked to hire her own independent lawyer , but the court decided she should be represented by the @entity73 ( a state - appointed lawyer ) whom she met only a few minutes before the hearing began			1
during the case in @entity75 , @entity60 was made to sit on a wooden bench through nearly nine hours of evidence by lawyers and medical experts at a cost to the public purse of thousands of pounds			1
on four occasions , @entity60 put up her hand to get the attention of the judge and stated in a clear soft voice that she did not want the council interfering in her life and was happy with her private carers			1
judge mrs justice @entity90 ordered that the identity of @entity60 , her carers , the council and the medical experts should remain secret for the time being			1
this is despite a ruling last month by sir @entity98 , the top family court judge , that councils applying to remove children into care or take control of the lives of the old and sick can no longer hide behind a cloak of anonymity			2
sitting at the @entity106 in @entity75 , judge mr @entity107 ordered the woman 's identity and that of her carers to remain secret despite miss g signing a form waiving her anonymity expert witnesses and social workers should , he said , be named in public			1
the landmark change breaks a silence that has surrounded family justice for a quarter of a century and follows a campaign against the secrecy in family courts by the @entity124			0
after the hearing , miss @entity60 told the @entity124 : ‘ i do not want to be silenced about how council social workers have treated me			1
' i invited this couple to live with me as family 18 months ago			2
we come from the same part of the @entity131 and the female carer and i are distant relatives			0
' the council began to make false accusations against the two of them and interfered in my life			0
’ she added : ‘ i was frightened when the social workers and police kept bursting into my home			1
‘ the council carers from an agency cut short my visits and did not shower me very often in two years			0
‘ there were rats in my house and everything smelt			0
i was in a bad state when i invited the private carers to live with me instead			0
’ @entity152 , barrister for mrs c , said the council ’s care agency team had eaten miss g ’s food and left the fridge empty so there was nothing for her			2
she said the council had put ‘ intense pressure ’ on @entity161 , adding : ‘ the level of state intrusion has been oppressive			0
’ miss @entity161 used to be an @entity37 nurse and has her own savings and a pension to live off of ( file picture ) and she added that @entity60 called mrs c her ‘ niece ’ , which gave a sense of the esteem in which she held her			1
the court heard that @entity60 owned her own house on the outskirts of @entity75 and has an @entity37 pension and savings			1
three medical experts gave evidence on miss g ’s mental capacity			0
one , a psychologist hired by @entity60 , said she had told him her female carer was ‘ like a daughter ’ to her			2
miss @entity60 had said : ‘ she does everything for me , gardening , cooking , combing my hair , looking after me			1
we have some quarrels from time to time , like any family			0
i trust her because she is honest			0
’ the psychologist added she had completed many of the mental tests ‘ satisfactorily ’ , although she might need some help in the future to monitor her financial affairs			0
mrs @entity90 said it was important to make sure @entity60 was ‘ not suffering from undue pressure from anyone ’ , adding : ‘ the difficulty is that questions have been raised about the care she receives			2
the court has a duty to protect her			0
’ she reserved judgment and will give a preliminary ruling next week on whether @entity60 has mental capacity to decide her own affairs			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

miss g , whose identity has been kept secret by a judge , lives in her own home on the outskirts of @entity75 on an @entity37 pension and savings
she stays with two carers , a married couple , who look after her 24/7
social workers ordered in over fears the couple had too much influence
they have now visited 12 times over the course of nine months
couple may now be forced to leave despite miss g 's *objections*
miss @entity60 repeatedly stated she can cope and wants to be left alone
