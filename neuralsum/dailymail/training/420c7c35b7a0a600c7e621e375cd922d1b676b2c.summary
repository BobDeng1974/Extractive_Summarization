@entity0 always enjoys having a relatively low profile at the start of the @entity3 , but friday ’s draw did at least offer the hope that he can make a run into the business end of the tournament			0
while @entity13 was looking at a repeat of last year ’s final with a match in the last eight against compatriot @entity12 , the 27 - year - old @entity9 would not look any further than his first round against world no 55 @entity17			1
in theory he could meet @entity19 in the quarter - finals and then @entity13 in the semis , with @entity22 and @entity23 together on the other side of the draw			1
@entity17 is one of several @entity36 who have defected to @entity37 , enticed by the prospect of greater earnings there			2
an impressive shotmaker with a career high ranking of 33 , he made a slow start to the year but has gradually picked up since			0
his highs in 2014 were beating @entity19 in the @entity46 in february , although the @entity47 may have had a hangover from winning the @entity49			0
@entity17 showed how dangerous he was by beating @entity50 in the first round of the @entity52 although he had to retire in the next round			1
defending champion : @entity13 kisses the trophy after beating compatriot @entity12 in last year 's final in great form : @entity23 beat @entity13 in the final of the @entity52 last weekend round one : @entity17 round two : @entity59 round three : @entity61 fourth round : @entity63 quarter - finals : @entity19 semi-finals : @entity13 final : @entity23 a gentler second round against @entity68 @entity59 might await , with the scheduled seeds @entity0 would meet first being the very steady @entity70 @entity61 followed by @entity63 , who he has beaten at @entity3 before			1
but really , beyond the first round it is all theoreticals in the men ’s event			0
among the women @entity76 finds herself drawn in the same half as @entity79 , but with a first round against @entity81 of @entity82			0
@entity83 took her place in the draw , despite having recent knee injury problems and feeling the pain of her split from @entity89			2
four @entity91 players started the day still alive in qualifying but @entity94 ’s @entity93 fell in the second round , beaten 6 - 3 7 - 6 by top qualifying seed @entity96 of @entity98			0
looking for an 18th @entity100 title : @entity22 is in the same half of the draw as @entity23 trooper : @entity83 will take her place in the draw after split from golfer @entity89 this week			1

@entity35 champion will face world no 55 @entity17 in first round
@entity13 and @entity19 possible *opponents* in later stages
@entity83 will compete after @entity115 split this week
