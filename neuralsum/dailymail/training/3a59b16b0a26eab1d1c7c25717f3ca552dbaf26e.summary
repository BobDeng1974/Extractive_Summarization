a newlywed who plans on ending her life after being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer says her works towards legalizing doctor assisted suicide - and not children - will be her legacy			1
@entity7 , 29 , of @entity8 , @entity9 , who has stage 4 glioblastoma , released a heartbreaking video last week discussing her desire to die with dignity while also encouraging other states to make the practice of doctor assisted suicide legal			1
now , in a new interview , she is responding to critics who are calling her decision selfish , while also explaining how her fight to make it legal for others to die on their own terms will be what she leaves behind when she passes away			0
she now plans on taking the pills that will end her life at her home on november 1 , just six days after her husband 's birthday			1
her biggest regret however is that she will never get to have a family			2
' i 'd say most of my sadness centers around how much i wanted a family , ' @entity34 told @entity56			1
' and it feels like for me , that was always , like , how you created a legacy was , like , through your children			0
and sort of inadvertently -- through sharing my story , i 've realized there 's a bit of the legacy i 'm creating this way and i 'm not ashamed of that			0
i 'm not ashamed to attach my name to what i think is a right that should belong to all terminally ill @entity71			0
' staying positive : @entity34 has made it clear she does not want to die , but rather wants to make sure she goes on her own terms , before she has great pain and is a burden to those around her @entity81 reality : after reviewing @entity34 's cancer ( above ) doctors said she likely had six months to live the young woman is also making it clear to her detractors that she ultimately does not want to end her life , she just sees no other choice , especially given what her quality of life would be should she fight this diagnosis			1
' i do n't want to die , " @entity34 explained			1
' if anyone wants to hand me , like , a magical cure and save my life so that i can have children with my husband , you know , i will take them up on it			2
' she then added , ' i think until anyone has walked a mile in my shoes and knows what they 're facing and has felt the - like , just bone - splitting headaches that i get sometimes , or the seizures , or the inability to speak , or the moments where i 'm looking at my husband 's face and i ca n't think of his name			2
' devastated mother : @entity114 ( above ) , who raised @entity34 on her own , told her daughter she would happily attend to her daughter and feed her and change her diapers if she changed her mind in the same interview , her mother , @entity114 , who raised @entity34 on her own , talks about the discussion she had about her daughter when she learned of her decision			2
' early on , i told her , " it would be my honor to take care of you , whichever way ; if you need to be fed or diapered , it would be my honor , " ' she said			0
' and that was important for me , for her to know			0
' @entity34 's husband , @entity130 , also talked about how sad he is that he will not get to spend the rest of his life with the woman he married just over one year ago			1
' that was the original plan , right ? ' he said			0
' but the reality that , i guess , that feeds into the argument of quality of life versus just quantity			0
' final farewell : @entity34 plans to end her life on november 1 , just six days after her husband 's birthday family and friends : @entity34 has said she will die in her own room surrounded by her husband , mother , stepfather and best friend and @entity34 will not see cancer ultimately defeat her , or watch herself lose her quality of life and burden those around her			1
' no , cancer is ending my life , ' she said			2
' i am choosing to end it a little sooner and in a lot less pain and suffering			0
