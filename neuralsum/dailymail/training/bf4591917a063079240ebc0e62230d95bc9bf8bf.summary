by @entity0 published : 12:04 est , 21 august 2013 updated : 10:03 est , 10 october 2013 scientists think they have solved the mystery of why some rogue planets exist in space without orbiting a star			0
astronomers from @entity7 and @entity8 believe orphan planets with no parent star can form in tiny , cold dust clouds in space			1
research has shown there could be as many as 200 billion ' free - floating ' planets in our galaxy alone			2
the @entity17 ( pictured ) is a huge cloud of gas and dust 4,600 light years from @entity21 which harbours hundreds of ' globulettes ( inset )			1
orphan planets with no parent star can form in tiny , round dark clouds that are flying through space at 80,000 kilometres per hour , scientists believe until now it was assumed that such ' rogue planets ' must have been ejected from their solar systems			2
but new observations point to the likelihood of some free - floating worlds forming on their own			1
astronomers used several telescopes to observe the @entity17 , a huge cloud of gas and dust 4,600 light years from @entity21 in the constellation of @entity39 , the @entity39			1
the nebula is home to more than 100 of the unusual planet - forming clouds , dubbed ' globulettes '			1
each has a diameter less than 50 times the distance between the @entity48 and the planet @entity50			0
dr @entity51 , from @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity7 , said : ' we found that the globulettes are very dense and compact , and many of them have very dense cores			1
' that tells us that many of them will collapse under their own weight and form free - floating planets			0
the most massive of them can form so - called brown dwarfs			0
' @entity65 dwarfs , sometimes called failed stars , are bodies whose mass lies between that of planets and stars			0

the nebula is home to more than 100 of the unusual planet - forming clouds , dubbed ' globulettes ' the tiny clouds are speeding outwards through the @entity17 at around 80,000 kilometres per hour , the astronomers found			1
their results are published in the latest edition of the journal @entity87			0
co-author @entity88 , from the @entity89 in @entity8 , said : ' we think that these small , round clouds have broken off from tall , dusty pillars of gas which were sculpted by the intense radiation from young stars			2
' they have been accelerated out from the centre of the nebula thanks to pressure from radiation from the hot stars in its centre			0
' the scientists believe countless millions of nebulae such as the @entity17 have bloomed and faded away during the @entity106 â€™s long history			2
many could have given birth to free - floating planets			0
professor @entity109 , from @entity110 in @entity7 , who led the research , said : ' if these tiny , round clouds form planets and brown dwarfs , they must be shot out like bullets into the depths of the @entity106			0
' ' there are so many of them that they could be a significant source of the free - floating planets that have been discovered in recent years			2
