when @entity2 @entity1 in @entity3 lost control of 50 nuclear , inter-continental missiles last october , officials said a communication failure between the control centre and the weapons was to blame			1
however , three missile technicians stationed at the base have raised fresh questions in the case , amid reports @entity16 sightings coincided with the incident			2
@entity16 researcher @entity18 says eyewitnesses claim the interruption to the power supply also lasted much longer than the @entity22 admits			1
cover - up claims : missile technicians stationed at @entity25 in @entity3 have reported @entity16 sightings coinciding with october 's power outage a power failure on october 23 , 2010 meant that one - ninth of @entity31 ’s nuclear arsenal went offline for almost an hour			1
a @entity31 @entity22 spokesman said there had been a ' hardware issue ' relating to an underground cable linking the command centre with the missiles			1
this disrupted ‘ communication between the control centre and the missiles , but during that time they were still able to monitor the security of the affected missiles ’			1
defence officials insisted there was never any danger of an accidental launch			2
but the incident was deemed serious enough for @entity50 to be briefed on it later			1
speaking out : @entity16 researcher @entity18 says three eyewitnesses have come forward to him on the condition of anonymity there was no evidence of foul play and the @entity31 never lost the capability to launch the missiles , although it could only have done so from an airborne command and control centre , he said			1
another official said there had been similar breakdowns on other bases in the past			0
but @entity18 says more was involved			0
according to @entity18 , three missile maintenance technicians have agreed to speak to him on the condition of anonymity , revealing the military has kept @entity16 sightings that occurred during the power outage under wraps			2
the witnesses , he said , reported sightings of ' a large cigar - shaped object high above the missile field '			0
minuteman missile : computer breakdown meant the @entity22 lost control for 59 minutes , officials say @entity18 told @entity80 : ' they said the object was seen in the sky above the field , throughout the weekend , both during the ( missile ) disruption and the following day			1
' his witnesses claim the power outage lasted several hours longer than officials reported			1
' i have detailed information about the events			0
the @entity22 said this ( missile ) disruption lasted 59 minutes			1
it actually lasted the better part of 26 hours , ' he said			2
' it was intermittent and involved a very specific sequence of these five missile alert facilities going on and offline			0
i have all of that down to the most minute detail			0
' blast : a minuteman nuclear - tipped missile takes off from its launch facility at @entity107 , @entity108 the eyewitnesses agreed that what they saw ' was not a commercial blimp			2
' ' it had no passenger gondola and no advertising on its hull , ' @entity18 said			0
' further , its aspect ratio ( length to width ) was very similar to a @entity120 : long and thin , and not at all like the squat shape of a corporate blimp			0
' the witnesses did not , however , claim the alleged @entity16 was connected with the outage			0
it is not the first time @entity127 has reported @entity16 sightings at nuclear missile sites			2
going public : captain @entity131 accused the @entity22 of lying in september he organised a press conference last september , when six former @entity22 officers stepped forward to reveal they had seen or had been involved with sightings at missile sites			1
they claim that since 1948 , aliens have been hovering over @entity137 and @entity31 nuclear missile sites and deactivating the weapons - once even landing in a @entity137 base			1
the men said they were encouraged not to speak to the media about their sightings			0
captain @entity131 , who was among the six , confirmed : ‘ we ’re talking about unidentified flying objects , as simple as that			0
' however , lieutenant colonel @entity147 , director of public affairs for @entity150 headquarters at @entity151 in @entity152 , denies there is a policy to silence eyewitnesses to unexplained phenomena at @entity22 bases			1
' i have no reason to dispute anybody 's claims of anything they may seen historically , because those occurrences and reports took place decades into the past and probably will decades into the future , ' he told @entity80			2
' this incident is separate from all of that			0
we took it very seriously and we 're very confident that we understand fully what happened			0
' ' if people see things that are unusual , they are encouraged to report them , ' he said , adding : ' when people join the military , they do n't give up their first amendment rights			0
