prosecutors have launched a criminal inquiry after receiving a complaint that @entity14 and 12 of his friends had ‘ incited racial hatred and glorified crimes against humanity ’			1
the 32 - year - old mp for @entity17 in @entity18 was celebrating with the group in the resort of @entity21 earlier this month			0
nasty party : @entity23 attended his stag party dressed as a member of the infamous @entity26 , while other guests saluted @entity28 during the stag party , accountant @entity23 , a 34 - year - old @entity29 graduate , wore a replica ss uniform			1
another guest , sitting next to the mp in a restaurant , was filmed raising a toast to ‘ the ideology and thought process of the @entity6 ’			1
later , after moving on to a @entity40 - themed pub , some of the group chanted : ‘ @entity41 ! @entity42 ! ’ , ‘ @entity44 ! @entity44 ! @entity44 ! ’ and ‘ @entity43 ! @entity43 ! @entity43 ! ’ @entity44 founded the @entity26 , while he and @entity43 were responsible for the @entity45			1

@entity55 , counsel for @entity57 restaurant , where the stag night started , said they had filed a criminal complaint , as had @entity61 , director of @entity7 pressure group @entity62			0
calling for mr @entity14 to be fired , mr @entity63 said : ‘ the hotel management should have made a complaint straight away , but better late than never			2
’ mr @entity14 , who has since been sacked from his post as a parliamentary private secretary , has apologised for his ‘ crass and insensitive ’ behaviour and the ‘ terrible offence ’ he caused			2
he strenuously denies that he took part in toasts to the @entity6 , and has distanced himself from the ‘ inexcusable behaviour ’ of other guests at the party			1
but mr @entity14 would not directly address claims that he hired the ss uniform for the stag night			2
the @entity2 said it was launching an investigation into mr @entity14 ’s behaviour			0
under the @entity7 penal code , it is a crime , unless required for a film , play or historical exhibition , to exhibit in public a uniform or insignia reminiscent of those worn by the @entity87			0
strongly condemned : mp @entity88 ( right ) with @entity23 and other guests during their @entity91 stag night complaint : owners of restaurant @entity94 filed a complaint against members of the stag party mr @entity14 said last night : ‘ i have not been contacted by the @entity7 authorities and i have repeatedly apologised for what was clearly inappropriate behaviour which caused offence to others			1
‘ being involved in a stag party where an ss uniform was worn was wrong and offensive			0
it was the wrong decision on my part , crass and insensitive			0
' i am deeply sorry , and want to take this opportunity to offer the people of @entity17 an unreserved , wholehearted and full apology for the terrible offence this incident has undoubtedly caused			0
’ tasteless : @entity23 's brother , @entity114 , gave the ' @entity6 ' toast			0
