tired of throwing money at ketchup cleaning method expensive cleaning products and worried about the effects of chemicals on your family home ? well , the latest internet craze is to do housework using food from your kitchen			1
@entity14 pulls on her marigolds , opens her larder and tests just how dirt - busting the edible cleaners can be ... clean rusty metal with a potato @entity21 does it work ? cut a potato in half , dip the cut end into a flat dish of table salt and rub it all over the rusted areas of metal pans			1
if the potato becomes too soft , cut it again and apply more salt			1
the abrasive power of the salt helps remove the residue from the surface			1
oxalic acid is found in many household cleaning products			1
verdict : my grandmother always insisted that potatoes could clean her pots and pans but i thought it was an old wives ' tale			1
i have rust at the bottom of my favourite milk pan , which i 'd normally tackle with an eye - watering chemical spray			1
can a simple potato cut through the rust better ? incredibly , yes			1
the potato 's creamy starch oozes out but the salt sticks to the rust			1
after five minutes of hard scrubbing , the worst has come away			1
i go outside and try the other half of the potato on my rusting 20 - year - old @entity74			1
the neighbours see me rubbing a potato on my car and decide i 'm mad			1
but large chunks of orange rust come away , so who am i to care ? 4/5 goodbye to grease with a @entity81 @entity21 does it work ? cut a grapefruit in half , dip the cut end into salt , and scrub the bottom of your greasy oven			1
you can also use it on dirt - encrusted oven trays — and the inside of your bath			1
grapefruits contain natural chemicals called furocoumarins , which attack bacteria and act as disinfectants			1
in fact , many commercial cleaning products contain grapefruit extract for its cleaning power and fresh smell			1
verdict : i ca n't stand the bitter taste of grapefruit — but the smell of oven cleaner makes me feel just as sick			1
i buy a large grapefruit , dip it into salt and scrub the greasy inside of my cooker			1
layers of thick , black grease are instantly lifted , and my oven grills go from black to shiny silver			2
but the best thing is the smell			2
my stinking oven is like the inside of a @entity123 shop			2
i 'll never buy oven cleaner again ! 5/5 white bread to dust paintings @entity21 does it work ? white bread is highly absorbent so attracts other matter such as dust and grime			1
but the yeast , flour and water inside the bread leaves no residue — so your beloved pictures are safe if you use a slice as a duster			2
dab it over the surface to pick up the dirt			2
verdict : i was once advised to use white bread to pick up shards of broken glass , and it worked brilliantly			2
but i 'm dubious about wiping my favourite painting , which has pride of place in the living room , with a slice of white @entity152			2
as i very gingerly move it over the painting , the white bread turns satisfyingly grey			2
it 's so effective , i even use it to scoop up an old spiders ' web			2
4/5 best thing since sliced bread : it works as a duster too @entity162 windows with onions @entity21 does it work ? chop an onion into four and place the pieces in a bucket of warm water			1
leave for at least half an hour , so the onion juices can infuse into the water , before removing the onion			2
the liquid will apparently make your windows sparkle without streaks			2
when onions are chopped , the juices release organsulfur , a disinfectant cleaner that attacks microscopic biological germs			2
@entity179 is often used industrially in solvent cleaners			1
verdict : i ca n't go near an onion without crying , so when my husband arrives home to find me weeping by the window , he fears something terrible has happened			1
onions are great natural cleaners but they 've never been widely used for cleaning because of the smell			1
mine might have removed hidden germs but the glass is smeared and the stench is unbearable			2
0/5 @entity195 pans with @entity196 @entity21 does it work ? rub a thin layer of ketchup on the surface of dull or tarnished copper and stainless - steel pans			1
the acetic acid ( a weak organic chemical that gives condiments a bitter taste ) in the vinegar in the ketchup will react with the tarnish and remove it			2
copper pans tarnish because the copper combines with oxygen in the air to form copper oxide , which is brown			2
the acetic acid attacks the copper oxide , dissolving the brown layer			2
this can then be wiped off with a soft cloth			0
stainless - steel pans often contain an inner core of copper sandwiched between the layers of steel on the bottom of the pan , to increase heat conductivity			0
this tarnishes in the same way as pure copper and can also be cleaned with ketchup			0
result ! @entity14 was amazed at how well ketchup cleaned her dirty pans verdict : when i wipe the ketchup off my copper saucepan , it looks shiny and new			1
the water stains and dark deposits on the bottom have gone			0
it 's as if i 've waved a magic wand			0
5/5 polished : vinegar worked a treat on the shower @entity244 shines your shower @entity21 does it work ? mix pure white vinegar with an equal amount of water and pour it in a spray bottle			1
then spray on to the surface and wipe off			0
the acetic acid inside vinegar has been used as an anti-bacterial agent since @entity256 times			0
when dissolved in water , it breaks down into hydrogen and acetate , both of which weaken stains			0
however , you must only ever use white vinegar or distilled white vinegar because these contain just 5 per cent acetic acid , which wo n't damage your surfaces			0
do not use on stone finishes ( such as granite and marble ) , iron , stainless steel , bronze or copper , as the acid can damage them			0
and never mix the vinegar with bleach or alcohol , as it will become corrosive			0
verdict : i spend a fortune on expensive glass - cleaning products , so i am really hoping this will work			1
i spray the vinegar mix on my glass shower screen , wipe with a soft cloth — and the glass is shiny and smear - free			0
but my bathroom smells like a fish and chip shop			0
i find an online tip to peel an orange and soak the vinegar in a bottle with the peel for three days before use			0
this works - it smells of sweet oranges and does a great job on my tiles , too			0
4/5 @entity302 skins to polish shoes @entity21 does it work ? if your leather shoes are looking scuffed and dull , rub them with the inside of a banana peel , as it contains atoms of nitrogen , sulphur and carboxylic acids , which act as natural cleaning agents			1
wipe away the remaining banana residue and buff with a soft cloth for a glossy sheen			0
the potassium in bananas is a key ingredient used in commercial shoe polishes			0
it absorbs into leather and helps diminish scuff marks			0
verdict : as i rub a banana skin over my husband 's favourite brown leather shoes , i start to panic			0
the gunk is making them look utterly revolting ! i grab a cloth and scrub away , and thank goodness the smeary banana residue disappears			0
it has cleaned the shoes but traditional polish does a far smarter job			0
later , my husband asks me why his shoes smell of banana			0
1/5 sticky problem : the sugar attracts bacteria so it 's not worth it to remove lime scale cola for the @entity346 @entity21 does it work ? everyone 's heard the myth about what happens to false teeth if you leave them overnight in a cup of cola			1
well , it 's the same principle if you use the fizzy drink on the limescale inside your toilet bowl			0
it 's all thanks to the phosphoric acid in the cola and the carbonic acid in the carbon dioxide ( which creates the bubbles )			0
pour a one - litre bottle into the bowl and around the rim			0
leave it for at least an hour or , better still , overnight			0
most of the limescale and dirt should have been dissolved and will disappear when you flush — although you may need a brush to work on more stubborn stains			1
verdict : my son @entity376 comes home from school just in time to see me pour a bottle of @entity381 down the toilet			1
he 's terribly upset to see me ' banning ' fizzy drinks so dramatically - and only slightly mollified when i tell him i am trying an alternative to bleach			0
the inside of the bowl turns a horrible dark brown			0
three hours later , i flush , and the slightly tarnished limescale marks on the inside bowl have gone			0
it seems the perfect solution until the whole family complain they are ' sticking ' to the toilet seat			0
yes , cola is sticky - and the sugar residue also attracts bacteria			0
i think i 'll stick to bleach			0
