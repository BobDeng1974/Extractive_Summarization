by @entity0 published : 12:06 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 16:12 est , 11 march 2013 a dairyman who killed a 22 - month - old girl in a ' tragedy of untold proportions ' when he reversed over her in a milk float has been spared custody			0
@entity7 , 20 , was reversing at around 14mph in @entity8 , @entity9 , when he collided with @entity10 who ran into the road from between two parked cars			1
the toddler died the following day with abdominal and head injuries from being run over by both the back and front wheels of the float			1
@entity7 ( left ) , outside @entity18 , killed 22 - month - old @entity10 ( right ) when he was driving a milk float in @entity8 @entity7 , who was 18 at the time of the collision , pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving at @entity18			1
he was handed a 10 - month sentence in a young offenders ' institution , suspended for two years , and was ordered to do 250 hours of unpaid work			0
judge @entity28 described @entity7 's driving as ' remarkably foolish '			1
he said : ' a 22 - month - old child who wandered from the safety of her home into the street lost her life instantaneously when the front and rear wheels of the milk lorry went over the child			0
' this is a tragedy of untold proportions			0
nothing this court can do can bring this child back			0
' my sympathies and sensitivities are with the family of the child who was killed by a remarkably foolish but short - lived piece of driving by an otherwise decent young man			2
' the court heard @entity10 would have been visible to @entity50 for around 0.8 seconds before the impact @entity7 , of @entity8 , was collecting money on a milk round at around 5.30pm on august 25 , 2011			1
@entity54 , prosecuting , told the court @entity7 was aware that children were playing in the street and did not ask his colleague to watch for hazards as he reversed			1
@entity7 reversed around 60 metres down the road when he saw a blur in his wing mirror as @entity10 ran into his path and heard a bang as the milk float hit her , mr @entity54 said			1
he braked but the front and back wheels reversed over the little girl before the vehicle could stop			0
it was calculated that @entity10 would have been visible to @entity50 for around 0.8 seconds before the impact			1
experts found that if @entity7 was travelling more slowly , the milk float could have stopped before the wheels ran over the toddler , or the collision could have been avoided completely			1
mr @entity54 said @entity7 's speed was ' unsafe for the conditions '			2
judge @entity79 said @entity10 's family , who were not in court today , had experienced the ' ultimate nightmare of any parent '			2
sentencing @entity7 , he said : ' the little girl 's family will have a lifetime of unthinkable despair , for you can not recover from the death of a child			1
' he continued : ' speed kills			0
speed , and the devices to control it , are not nuisances to be avoided and cheated			0
and in your case , your speed killed that little girl			0
' judge @entity79 said @entity7 , who was described as a ' thoroughly decent , hard - working , law - abiding young man ' , would have to live with what he had done for the rest of his life			2
' it was an error , for which you directly and fully bear responsibility , which robbed a 22 - month - old baby girl of her life , ' he said			0
' your driving was inappropriate , was careless and you caused the death			1
' he added : ' you reversed too fast , too long , in a completely risk - full situation with a restricted view			0
' @entity7 , who stood in the dock wearing a dark - coloured suit and tie , showed no emotion as he was sentenced			2
he was disqualified from driving for two - and - a - half years .			0
