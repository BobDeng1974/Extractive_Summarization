the final season by @entity1 most of us are familiar with one football - related story from @entity7 — that during the so - called @entity12 truce of 1914 , @entity9 and @entity10 troops played each other along the @entity14			1
football was the ‘ common denominator that drew the two sides together for a few hours of peace and humanity amid the horrors of war ’ , writes @entity1 in this fascinating book			1
he provides evidence that @entity24 lost one game 3 ‑ 2 : ‘ we can assume the @entity10 won on penalties , ’ he adds , wryly			1
@entity28 's @entity27 showed true courage by saving a comrade 's life already , by @entity12 , 1914 , @entity9 ’s dead included some of the nation ’s most feted footballers			1
in telling their stories , and those of the other players who perished , @entity1 offers a new perspective on the conflict itself			2
there is @entity43 , the @entity50 international once known as ‘ the prince of @entity45 ’ , an incorrigible entertainer who would sit on the crossbar at half - time , bantering with the crowd			2
he was also famously handsome — the @entity51 called him ‘ @entity55 ’s most eligible bachelor ’ — and was ‘ close ’ to the music hall star @entity53			1
@entity43 , who studied medicine at @entity57 , went with the @entity58 to @entity59			2
for many years , it was assumed , even by his family , that he died there			2
he joined the 9th @entity63 as a humble private , evidently because he wanted to fight even more than he wanted to treat the wounded			2
he died the following summer on the @entity65 , but not before showing great heroism , and more than a little evidence of his goalkeeping skills , in resisting an attack by @entity10 troops armed with flame - throwers			1
according to the regimental history , @entity43 , though choking and burnt , ‘ continued to throw bombs until his arm gave out ’			0
not all of these heroic former footballers died			1
@entity1 tells the remarkable story of corporal @entity78 , the former @entity28 player			0
in june 1915 , he volunteered to crawl out , under constant fire and at the cost of his left eye and right foot , almost to the @entity10 lines to retrieve a badly - wounded officer , lieutenant @entity84			0
two months later , @entity85 presented him with the @entity86			0
even more thrillingly , perhaps , he received standing ovations from huge crowds at @entity89 and @entity90 , home of @entity28 ’s bitter rivals @entity92 — on the very same day			0
@entity27 and @entity84 remained great friends for their rest of their lives			0
@entity84 died in 1956 , angus three years later			0
another who survived the war , but not to play football again , was @entity100 , a @entity102 player famed for his incredible speed , and so devastatingly good - looking ( or so he claimed ) he used to boast that women came to matches just to see him			1
‘ @entity100 can maybe pass the ball , but he could n’t pass a mirror if he tried , ’ one of his teammates once joked			0
in a field hospital at the @entity65 , @entity100 came within minutes of having his left foot amputated			0
it was saved by a captured @entity10 surgeon			0
213 professional players fell in action in @entity7 the tales of these men before ( and , in some cases , after ) the war give this book a hugely poignant punch			1
the background story of football itself is also enthralling , for then , as now , those playing it professionally seemed to be the most gilded of young men			1
in 1914 , there were almost 4,500 professional players in @entity9 , the best of them earning £ 4 a week legitimately , but much more ‘ under the table ’			1
by definition , they were among the fittest of their generation , yet few of them joined up at the outbreak of war , since @entity141 secretary @entity140 decreed that ( unlike rugby and cricket ) the season would continue regardless			0
a few weeks later , author sir @entity145 ( @entity1 neglects to tell us @entity148 ’s creator was an former goalkeeper ) weighed in , appealing to footballers to fight for their country			1
still they did n’t , causing widespread dismay			0
all of the 16th @entity153 were either gassed or wounded in battle , with some later dying from their injuries then , as now , those governing football seemed to be a law unto themselves			1
however , the impasse was broken when 16 players for @entity102 , then leading the @entity163 , joined a new battalion , the 16th @entity164			0
the next day , an @entity166 mp , @entity165 , decided to raise a battalion of footballers , the 17th @entity169			2
the 16th @entity164 regiment , pictured in 195 , were also keen footballers including @entity172 ( far left ) and @entity173 ( third from far left ) needless to say , they prospered in the inter-army football tournament , beating the 34th @entity176 11 - 0 in the 1916 final			1
they distinguished themselves on the battlefield , too , but with significant losses			0
as for the 16th @entity164 , machine - gun fire on the @entity65 yielded a terrible statistic : @entity102 lost three of their finest players , @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 , in under a minute			2
for those of us who love football , and still more for those who make fortunes playing it , all this sacrifice should offer considerable food for thought			1
@entity197 says as much in a thoughtful foreword			0
and , while @entity1 ’s book is not perfect , with a slightly ponderous prose style at times , i wish with all my heart a copy could be given to every @entity206 player as he embarks on negotiations for another £ 20,000 a week			2

how @entity55 lost its ' most eligible bachelor ' in the @entity7
many of the *bravest* **soldiers** were also household names more used to playing football than mortal combat
the game offered **soldiers** light relief and *boosted* morale among the troops
