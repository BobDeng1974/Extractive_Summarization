@entity0 is becoming of singletons , partners and co-habiters , as the number of people choosing not to marry has rocketed by 3.6million in just a decade , according to new figures			1
the final results from the 2011 census from across the @entity0 show that more than a third of the population - around 17.8million people - now class themselves as single			1
this means the number of @entity0 singletons has increased by a quarter - while the number of divorcees has risen by a fifth to 4.5million people			1
@entity19 generation : @entity21 played @entity23 's famous singleton in the film version of the eponymous diarist 's life story same - sex civil partnerships , which did not even exist a decade earlier , accounted for around 113,000 people in 2011 census			1
the figures also show that - thanks , experts say , to mass immigration and a baby boom - the proportion of people old enough to marry who have chosen to do so has fallen from 51 per cent to below 47 per cent			2
many couples now choose to co-habit rather than tie the knot in the traditional way			2
but the figures also betray the phenomenon of the ' @entity19 generation ' - named after the single heroine of @entity23 's novel series , and describing men and women of marriage age who remain unmarried			0
yet despite the decrease in traditional mother - and - father couples , the number of family cars on @entity0 roads is increasing twice as fast as the human population			1
meanwhile , the number of widows fell by more than 300,000 as men catch up with women in terms of life expectancy			0
there are also one million more pensioners than there were a decade ago and 600,000 more full time unpaid carers , while one in six @entity0 is over 65			0
immigration has also soared - spurred by the expansion of the @entity64 - and foreign - born residents now account for 13 per cent of the @entity0 's population			1
some 8million foreign - born people now live in the @entity0 - a 4.1 million increase on the 4.9million of 2001 , which has boosted the @entity0 population to 63.2 million			1
the number of @entity73 - born people living in the @entity0 has increased tenfold in a decade			1
four in ten @entity74 are from an ethnic minority - although in @entity77 non-white people account for only two per cent			0
the wedding : @entity80 and @entity21 play @entity81 and @entity19 when they did eventually get hitched ... although @entity23 's latest novel sends @entity19 back to singledom and it gives a glimpse of lifestyles have changed even more than the population			0
despite the impact of environmentalism and a renaissance in cycling , the number of family cars on @entity0 roads are increasing twice as fast as the human population			2
yet , in a vivid illustration of the impact of the impact of improvements in medical care , the number of widows in @entity0 fell by more than 300,000 â€“ in evidence that men are finally closing the gap on women in life expectancy			2
@entity109 of the @entity111 think - tank said that it was undeniable that marriage was losing its popularity - but stressed that it is still widely seen as the desirable way to bring up children			0
' it 's misleading to look at the population as a whole - the majority of families with children - five eighths of couples with children - are married , ' he said			0
but what is a worrying is the way the trend away from marriage reflects the rise of family breakdown			0
' although the number of divorces has gone down , over the last ten years , the rise in family breakdown is due to a very simple equation - the rise in family breakdown is due to the decline in marriage .			0

around 17.8m @entity0 - a third of the population - say they are single
number of divorcees up by a fifth in a decade to 4.5m people
there are around 113,000 civil partnerships in @entity0 , 2011 census shows
many couples choose to co-habit or marry later in life , experts say
immigrants now form 13 *%* of population - from 4.9m in 2011 to 8m in 2011
