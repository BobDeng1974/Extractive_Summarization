from being cut off in the middle of an important call , to finding yourself stranded , everyone has experienced the frustration of their smartphone running out of battery at the most inconvenient moment			0
but this could be a thing of the past , as scientists in the @entity11 have developed a device that could charge your phone at a distance - even while it ’s still in your pocket – so you will never run out of juice again			1
the prototype @entity20 wireless charger can charge an iphone 4 battery in five hours , at a distance of 12 inches ( 30cm ) away			1
running out of phone battery at the most inconvenient moment ( illustrated ) could become a thing of the past because scientists in the @entity11 have developed a device that could charge your phone at a distance , while it ’s still in your pocket – so you will never run out of battery again			1
while wireless chargers already exist , they require a phone to be placed directly on a charging ‘ pad ’ so users still have to remember to charge their phones and place them on the device in the right way			1
@entity39 , of the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) who is behind the new technology , told @entity43 : ‘ in our vision we wanted to have people 's phone charge the minute they are sitting next to their desk : they go to a meeting , they come back , the phone starts charging again			1
’ the prototype uses a magnetic coil to beam energy to a phone around 12 inches away and it does n't matter how the phone is positioned – so it could be lying on a desk or in someone ’s pocket			1
the idea is that coils could one day be placed around homes and offices to top up the batteries of devices detected nearby			1
the prototype uses a magnetic coil to beam energy to a phone around 12 inches away and it does n't matter how the phone is positioned – so it could be lying on a desk or in someone ’s pocket			1
it means that users would n't have to use a lead ( pictured ) and remember to charge devices as they do now @entity20 uses magnetic fields to charge a mobile			1
the @entity20 transmitter has a number of coils to generate a magnetic field			1
coils could one day be installed around the home and offices			2
when a phone enters that field its presence is detected			0
the transmitter varies the field generated by each coil to focus the magnetic field in the area of the phone			2
‘ @entity20 consumes as much power as existing solutions , yet it can charge a phone remotely without being removed from the user 's pocket , ’ dr @entity39 and her team wrote in a paper which they shared at the @entity92 in @entity93 , @entity94			1
@entity20 's transmitter has a number of coils inside to that generate a magnetic field			2
when a phone enters that field , its presence is detected by the transmitter			0
it then focuses its energy on the phone that is within range by generating varying frequencies			0
this creates a stronger overall magnetic field that can reach the phone			0
in the experiment to demonstrate an early prototype , dr @entity39 connected a small wire coil to an @entity118 ’s charging point			0
the magnetic field induced a current in the coil to charge the phone			2
unlike strongly focused @entity121 , focused magnetic fields do not have a heating effect on human skin			0
the technology could be made available to consumers relatively quickly , because a number of smartphones already have a coil built in			0
@entity132 ’s @entity131 range as well as several @entity134 devices and the @entity135 can be charged using current wireless charging pads			0
it could also help speed the take - up of smart watches , which will likely need to be charged daily , such as the @entity140 , which supports wireless charging			0
the wearable devices have little room for batteries , so it would be ideal for a small battery to be frequently recharged from a distance without a wearers having to take them off			2
a @entity150 spokesman told @entity151 : ' this is a very exciting development and could be the first step in alleviating one of our customers ’ biggest bugbears – smartphone battery life			0
imagine a world where handsets charge automatically when in range of these wireless devices – it means phones will run for much longer without ever having to be hard - wired to the mains			2
it will also make it much easier to use a phone while it is charging , however it may be slower to reach full charge than a wired connection			0

@entity20 wireless charger can charge an iphone 4 battery in five hours , at a distance of 12 inches ( 30cm ) away
it was developed by scientists at the @entity40
prototype uses a magnetic coil to beam energy to a phone to recharge it
phone can be positioned in any way and even placed in a pocket
in the future , coils could be placed in homes and offices so that phones detected nearby would be automatically recharged
