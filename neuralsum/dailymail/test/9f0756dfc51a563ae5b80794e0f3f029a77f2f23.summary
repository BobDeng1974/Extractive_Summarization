@entity0 won gold in the 200 metres individual medley at the @entity3 to ensure qualification for the @entity5 this summer			1
@entity0 's time of two minutes 09:51 seconds was the fastest recorded in the world this year and came comfortably inside the @entity5 qualification mark of 2:10:20			1
@entity9 took the silver medal with a time of 2:11:65 and @entity12 claimed bronze in 2:13:30			2

' i 'm chuffed , the ( qualifying ) times are a massive challenge but it means everyone has to step up and race world class times , ' @entity0 said			1
' i 'm really just happy to have made the team			2
i 'm happy with that time , i just wanted to go under 2.10			0
' i would have ideally liked to have been closer to my personal best but sometimes you 're not on your best form			0
to get the qualifying time was my main aim			0
' @entity0 's time of two minutes 09:51 seconds was the fastest recorded in the world this year the performance of @entity0 , who won 100m freestyle gold on tuesday , is particularly impressive considering the heavy disruptions to her winter training programme			1
the pool at the @entity42 , where the 19 - year - old has trained for most of her career , has been closed for six months renovation meaning she and her group have been forced to relocate 32 miles away at @entity47			1
' it has been hard over the last six months , ' @entity0 added			2
' it has been a challenge but everyone has challenges in sport			0
' it 's just something we have to deal with			2
it could n't have been any better and i 'm proud to have adapted to it			0
' it 's definitely been tough , we 've all felt that			2
our pool is open in @entity62 after this though so i 'm looking forward to getting back there and getting some consistency again			0
' the 19 - year - old claimed two titles despite heavy disruptions to her winter training programme @entity70 followed up her success in the 400m freestyle on wednesday with a dominant performance in the 800m freestyle to win another gold medal			1
@entity70 clocked 8:21:58 which was enough to seal the title but she missed the @entity5 qualifying time of 8:21:22			1
the @entity14 and @entity80 champion is still likely to race the 800m in @entity18 , after finishing more than 10 seconds clear of @entity82 ( 8:32:19 ) in second and @entity83 in third ( 8:37:99 )			0
' i 'm not too disappointed to miss the qualifying time , ' @entity70 said			0

' it felt a bit tough tonight , i did n't really get into it , i felt a bit heavy in my stroke but that happens			0
' @entity96 won the women 's 100m backstroke , registering 1:00:03 , while @entity99 took gold in the men 's 200m backstroke with a time of 1:57:58 and @entity104 clinched the men 's 1500m freestyle title in 14:58:25 .			1
