by @entity0 published : 06:49 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 08:37 est , 1 august 2013 they may look more like @entity2 than the raging humanoid robots in ' @entity4 ' , but these thespian actors are certainly causing a stir			1
@entity7 is the creation of @entity10 engineer @entity9 who had an idea to develop an artistic robot that could react with its audiences			1
six years ago he embarked on a project to create a robot that would save tour guides from tediously repeating the same script each day			1
today , around 35 @entity18 are delighting theatre - goers and tourists throughout the world			1
the @entity10 company , operating from an industrial unit near @entity28 , is the world 's only maker of commercially available life sized humanoid robots engineered arts design and production engineer @entity33 works on a nearly completed @entity24 robot			1
now in its third generation , the fully interactive and multilingual @entity24 robot is sold around the world to science centres and visitor attractions , but increasingly to academic research groups and universities where they are used as research and development platforms they are also trained to recognise gestures such as waving goodbye and are able to copy body poses			1
they are multi-lingual and can even sing			2
but not everyone is pleased with the humanoid robots			2
@entity9 told humans invent how one @entity7 was punched by someone in @entity53			1
in a separate event @entity9 describes how ‘ a guy took offence because he thought the robot had looked at his girlfriend ’s tits basically and tried to attack it			1
‘ they said the robot always had a habit of looking low which caused this problem			2
it never made eye contact , it always looked at people ’s mid body ’			2
robothespians have in - built cameras , depth perception and facial recognition allowing them to react and adapt their script accordingly			1
they are also trained to recognise gestures such as waving goodbye and are able to copy body poses @entity7 's actions are based on a piece of software called shore developed in @entity53			1
this allows them to compare faces to a large database to extract where somebody is , whether they are male or female , their age and whether they are happy or angry , neutral or disinterested @entity9 ’s company , @entity10 - based @entity26 , is the world 's only maker of commercially available life sized humanoid robots			1
it produces the parts from an industrial unit near @entity28 with one robot costing around £ 55,000			2
they can also be rented out for a day or leased for a year			2
their movements are based on a piece of software called shore developed in @entity53			2
this allows them to compare faces to a large database to extract where somebody is , whether they are male or female , their age and whether they are happy or angry , neutral or disinterested			0
now in its third generation , it ’s not just theatres , science centres and visitor attractions , that are benefiting from the talents of @entity116			0
@entity117 recently reached new artistic heights by appearing in a live stage show , the legend of @entity121 : @entity123 's @entity122 , featuring a completely robotic cast mammal - like robots with whiskered touch systems , machines powered by slime and dancing humanoids that can communicate with humans are just a few of the robots invading the @entity133 today			1
the @entity135 conference is including robots that move and sense like animals , biohybrid exhibits that mix biological and artificial parts			0
the conference is concerned with the development of future technologies using the principles underlying living systems and the flow of communication signals between living and artificial systems			0
professor @entity149 from the @entity151 ’s @entity150 said : ' these technologies will have a profound effect on many different aspects of our future lives , posing important ethical questions and practical concerns that this event gives us chance to address			0
' the company claims that increasingly academic research groups and universities are using the robots in their research and development platforms			0
the application programming interface ( @entity167 ) is open , which means anyone can extend the software with software of their own			0
a restaurant in @entity174 , where robots cook all the food and robots take your order , is also using @entity18 as part of its operations			1
meanwhile , three @entity18 recently reached new artistic heights by appearing in a live stage show , the legend of @entity121 : @entity123 ’s @entity122 , featuring a completely robotic cast			1
and tv viewers saw robothespian and his glamorous assistant , @entity187 , take part in the @entity190 : @entity191 show on @entity192 last month			0
the theme of the episode was @entity133 and the object of the trick was to see if a humanoid robot , with a sensor and camera could be fooled by sleight of hand			0
‘ if you walk past it , it looks at you and it will try and work out what you are doing , ’ explained creator @entity9 in an interview with @entity202			0
‘ it can see 14 to 15 people standing around and it will flick its gaze and attention between them			0
it is designed to be as natural in its behaviour as possible			0
‘ also , from a technical point of view , it ’s a hybrid robot , so it is partly pneumatic and partly electric			0
most robots are one or the other and generally they are all electric			0
’ the group is now embarking on a two year project to make a full walking , running , jumping version			0
it is also developing a smaller half - body robot which has got a projected face , called @entity226 , which will be designed for the retail environment			1
the group is now embarking on a two year project to make a full walking , running , jumping version			0

@entity7 has in - built cameras , depth perception and facial recognition
it can adapt its script to the audience during stage shows and guided tours
several @entity18 , however , have been attacked for causing offence
