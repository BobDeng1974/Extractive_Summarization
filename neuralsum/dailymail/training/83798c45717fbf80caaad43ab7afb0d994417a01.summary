an @entity1 campaigner has fled her home town following death threats , abuse and the desecration of her mother ’s grave			1
@entity8 , who helped expose the horrific neglect at @entity10 which cost up to 1,400 lives , says ‘ vipers ’ have victimised her ever since she set up @entity12 the @entity1			1
she started the pressure group in her own cafe following the death of her mother at the hospital			1
but yesterday she handed over the keys to the business , having agreed a cut - price sale on @entity22			2
@entity23 : @entity10 campaigner @entity8 has quit the town after her mother 's grave was desecrated as part of a campaign of intimidation @entity29 , the business the mother - of - two has been forced to sell in a cut - price sale ‘ people have been coming into the cafe shouting that nothing happened at @entity36 , that i am lying and there were no unnecessary deaths , ’ she said last night			1
‘ i have been run out of town by small minded people , leaving my home , my livelihood and my friends because a few misinformed local political activists have fuelled a hate campaign based on lies			1
' this is a classic case of shooting the messenger			0
’ she said the final straw was the ‘ desecration of my mum ’s grave ’ that continued for six weeks			0
the 50 - year - old mother of two says her troubles began in 2009 when a @entity57 report into the failings at @entity1 put the future of its casualty department under threat			1
miss @entity8 said residents boycotted her café , reducing takings to as little as £ 40 a day she became a hate figure after local party activist @entity66 posted a video on @entity68 in which a man signing a @entity71 petition to save the unit expresses a hope that @entity74 would die			1
the video , which provoked a torrent of hateful emails and telephone calls , was posted by mr @entity66 in a personal capacity and was later taken down			0
the 49 - year - old said the comments were tongue in in cheek			0
miss @entity8 ’s plight became worse when another @entity71 activist claimed she had said at a public meeting : ‘ let ’s shut the hospital , let ’s sack all the staff ’			1
that demand , the activist , @entity94 , said , was ‘ met by loud cheers from her band of followers ’			0
this year the campaign against her took a sinister turn when the grave of miss @entity8 ’s mother , @entity98 , who was 86 when she died at the hospital after ‘ being dropped ’ by a nurse , was vandalised			1
this was followed by a postcard saying : ‘ thank you for closing @entity36 hospital , @entity102 , @entity102 , @entity102 , you better now spend more time watching your mother ’s grave			1
’ last month , emergency call handler @entity107 , 54 , was sacked by @entity110 ambulance service after comments appeared online about a wish for @entity74 to suffer ‘ a life - threatening illness ’			0
miss @entity8 said residents have been boycotting her café , reducing takings to as little as £ 40 a day			2
she is moving out of her rented home in @entity36 this weekend , initially to live in a static caravan at an undisclosed location			0
she sold the café for £ 14,000 and now plans to devote more time to turning @entity12 the @entity1 into a national charity			0
miss @entity8 told last month how damage had been caused to her mother ’s grave over a six - week period			1
@entity8 's mother @entity126 , who died at @entity10			1
her grave was desecrated and a note left on it reading ' ha ha ha ' speaking at the time , she said : ‘ the momentum seems to be growing when i go out onto the streets of @entity36			2
people come up to me and say “ it ’s not true , you were lying			0
you brought shame on the town and nobody died ”			0
‘ it just drains the strength from you and you ’re back grieving again			0
but the one thing i do say is , “ have you read any investigations ? did you go to the inquiry ? ’ ’ ’ @entity146 , 51 , who launched a @entity148 attack on @entity8 and wished a terminal illness on her , was sacked last night , mrs @entity94 , who was a volunteer assistant to @entity150 , the former @entity71 mp for @entity36 , stood by her blog post and accused @entity74 of forgetting what she had said at the public meeting in 2009			2
she said : ‘ i have notes of what @entity8 said and witnesses who also heard her comment			2
’ mrs @entity94 , who is involved in the @entity159 campaign which organised a march through the town attended by 30,000 people in april , said : ‘ barely anybody will have read that blog until its contents were picked up and disseminated by @entity12 the @entity1 members and supporters			2
’ @entity168 , one of the founders of the @entity159 campaign , insisted : ‘ we have had absolutely nothing to do with any of the problems @entity8 has faced			1
‘ we condemn the abuse @entity8 has received – the desecration of her mother ’s grave , the abusive emails and phone calls			1
‘ but these incidents are nothing to do with us			0
‘ we were set up as a campaign group fighting against night - time plans to close the accident and emergency department at the hospital , two years ago			1
' we are thankful for what @entity8 and @entity12 the @entity1 have done in exposing what went on at the hospital			1
but we are now one of the top 20 hospitals in the country for safety and @entity8 is part of the reason why			2
‘ we simply want to secure the long - term future of acute services at @entity36			0
we all need to work together to achieve this			0
’ she said it was sad that @entity74 had felt compelled to leave her home town			0
in february sir @entity197 published his final report into @entity199 which said the trust had put corporate self - interest ahead of patients			0
the public inquiry cost £ 13million			0
a @entity205 spokesperson said : ' we utterly condemn any abusive actions or comments made towards @entity8 or the @entity12 the @entity1 group			2
' scandal : the horrific neglect at @entity10 may have cost up to 1,400 lives			2

@entity8 *fearlessly* helped expose *appalling* conditions at @entity10
she was driven by the death of her mother @entity98 at the hospital
but she has faced a hate campaign from local activists
her mother 's grave was desecrated and she has been intimidated
the mother - of - two has now sold her cafe and moved away from town
