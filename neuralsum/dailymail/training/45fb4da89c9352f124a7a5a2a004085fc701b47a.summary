by @entity0 from changing a light bulb to cooking dinner , there are numerous times where an extra pair of hands would come in useful			0
and now roboticists at the @entity8 have created robotic arms that can lift heavy objects and reach things that your own can not			1
the arms may resemble those of @entity15 villain @entity15 , or @entity15 , but unlike the comic book creations , they are not fused to a person ’s body and can not be controlled by the mind			2
here , the arms mimic the wearer 's actions the arms can lift heavy objects and extend the reach of humans			1
they weigh 10lbs ( 9kg ) so they can be strapped to a person 's shoulders or hips			0
they can learn from the way a person 's body moves and mimic their movements			1
one day they could have a mind of their own to anticipate the wearer 's needs			1
the arms are designed to streamline tasks , give humans an extra pair of hands and become an extension of their own body			2
the extra limbs weigh around 10lbs ( 9kg ) so they can be strapped onto the shoulders or hips , but can still lift heavy objects like a human ’s			1
there were built at @entity8 's @entity61			1
while they may not use mind control , they can learn from the way a person ’s body moves , @entity62 reported			0
they are shown to mimic a person ’s movements in a video demonstration , but could one day have a mind of their own so they could come to a wearer ’s aid if they needed an extra hand			0
arms for evil ! @entity8 's robotic arms may resemble those of @entity15 villain @entity15 , or @entity15 ( pictured ) but unlike the comic book creations , they are not fused to a person 's body and can not be controlled by the mind accessory of the future ? the extra limbs ( illustrated ) weigh around 10lbs so they can be strapped onto the shoulders or hips , but can still lift heavy objects like a human 's currently the prototype arms could be used to open a door , leaving a wearer ’s hands free to carry shopping bags , for example , but in the future they could open the door for the struggling wearer in advance			1
it is thought that the arms could eventually learn routines , such as opening doors or helping handymen hold tools or panels while they compete a delicate task			0
' the extra limbs will help them hold objects , support the human body , share a workload and streamline the execution of a task , ' the experts said			2
' if the movements of such supernumerary limbs are tightly coupled and coordinated with their arms , the human users may come to perceive the extra limbs as an extension of their own body			0
helping hands : at the moment , the prototype arms could be used to open a door , leaving a human wearer 's hands free to carry shopping bags , for example , but in the future they could open the door for the struggling wearer in advance ( illustrated ) the future ? the arms could eventually learn routines , such as opening doors for shoppers , acting as stabilisers ( pictured left ) or helping handymen perform tasks ( pictured right ) such as opening and holding panels or tools so the dexterous human can do their job more effectively ' the overarching goal of this project is to study a new type of co-robots that is perceived to be an extension of the human body , working closely with the wearer			1
' the arms are different to others developed , such as the @entity149 ’s @entity148 arm , as they can move independently of a human ’s			0
the @entity148 arm could help its wearer carry an additional 40 pounds ( 18 kg ) which is around the weight of a four - year - old child and make it feel easy as lifting a cup of tea			0
but it can not deviate from a human ’s own arm to anticipate their actions			0
@entity8 ’s arms stop short of being a full exoskeleton , which can give humans super-human strength , but they could probably be used in the nearer future and be cheaper than full body suits			2
natural ? ' the overarching goal of this project is to study a new type of co-robots that is perceived to be an extension of the human body , working closely with the wearer , ' the arms ' creators said			0
they are used as a stabilising device in this illustration in tune : they are shown to mimic a person 's movements in a video demonstration ( pictured ) , but could one day have a mind of their own so they could come to a wearer 's aid if they needed a hand ... or two			1

experts at @entity8 's @entity61 have built the *extraordinary* arms that are *intended* to be an extension of the wearer 's own body
they are *lightweight* and can be worn on the shoulders or hips to help *people* lift heavy objects , or free up their own hands for another task
arms mimic a wearer 's movements but could one day anticipate actions to hold doors open for humans with their hands full , for example
they *slightly* resemble those of @entity15 in the film @entity217
