@entity0 and @entity1 fall foul of autocue error @entity4 blurts out ' oh sh * * ' @entity5 sends up stage frights by carrying drink on stage @entity10 's mispronunciation of @entity11 as @entity12 starts trending on @entity13 by @entity14 published : 20:29 est , 12 january 2014 updated : 06:19 est , 13 january 2014 veteran @entity17 actress @entity16 won the award for the most excruciating acceptance speech at the @entity20 in @entity21 on sunday night			1
the star delivered a cringe - worthy tv moment after being named best supporting actress in a tv show , @entity26 or tv movie for her @entity29 drama @entity31			2
she beat out rivals @entity33 ( @entity34 ) , @entity35 ( @entity36 ) , @entity37 ( @entity38 ) and @entity39 ( @entity40 ) for the gong			2
' i 'm stunned , ' she said , and went on to leave the audience and viewers rather gobsmacked too by her ramblings			0
in a car crash speech that was punctuated by long pauses , she swore and said she wanted to thank those who had given her ' pleasure and sh * t '			1
shock : @entity16 seemed genuinely surprised to win which may account for the strange incoherent speech tears : the actress was off her game from the beginning of the speech that started with a few tears ' @entity68 's incoherent speech sent the @entity69 into a spin the reaction on @entity13 was swift and merciless , with some branding it ' bonkers ' and the ' maddest acceptance speech in awards history '			1
@entity76 quipped : ' i helped write @entity16 's speech			2
did you like it ? ' @entity17 tv writer @entity81 wrote : ' really hoping @entity16 is still on stage silently staring when the show resumes after this ad break # @entity84 ' ' @entity86 had such a long walk to the stage she dropped her marbles on the way			2
# @entity84 , ' @entity91 quipped mercilessly			0
@entity92 could n't stand to watch and admitted : ' i ❤ @entity94 but i had to leave the room			0
' she won it : @entity16 displayed her trophy for @entity31 gamut of emotions : @entity16 was thrown by the win and her speech never came together she 's got it together : @entity16 was altogether more composed as she showed off her trophy backstage ' oh sh * * ! ' @entity4 made a blooper when she accepted her best actress in a @entity26 award @entity109 chipped in to brand @entity68 ' bonkers ' and added : ' maddest acceptance speech in awards history			1

@entity4 also had a slight stumble as she took the stage to accept her best actress gong for @entity127 , overcome with similar shock she exclaimed : ' oh sh * * ! ' @entity131 stars @entity1 and @entity0 got thrown off kilter when the wrong script ran on the prompter at the @entity20 , @entity129 pointed the error out and @entity135 laughed			1
luckily , they managed to save proceedings by checking their piece of paper			0
awkward moment : @entity1 and @entity0 had to turn to an old - fashioned piece of paper after an autocue error making fun : @entity5 sent up awards show disasters by arriving on stage with shoes in one hand and a martini in the other @entity5 parodied a stage disaster by arriving on stage with her heels in hand and a martini in another to present the @entity157 gong to @entity158 for her			1
she threw her heels over one shoulder to present the cult favourite with his trophy for the @entity165 - based love story			0
@entity5 , who looked stunning in gold , was obviously following @entity168 's advice that it 'll be fine and over soon , as long as people ' keep drinking ' as featured in this hilarious vine @entity172			1
somebody who could probably have done with a stiff drink after he presented @entity126 to @entity175 for @entity176 , was @entity10			1
floored by @entity177 and @entity179 's encouragement that the crowd should give him a warm welcome ' just like a supermodel 's vagina ' he pronounced @entity184 's @entity11 as @entity185 , which drew a laugh at the @entity187 and immediately started trending on @entity13			1
