@entity0 dramatically played the patriotic card yesterday by accusing @entity2 of trampling on the rights of the @entity4 by blocking ‘ home rule ’ measures for @entity4			1
in a move designed to upstage the @entity10 conference , which started on friday , the prime minister raised the stakes in the bitter war of words that has raged since the @entity15 referendum			0
mr @entity0 called on mr @entity2 to drop his opposition to @entity18 plans for ‘ @entity4 votes for @entity4 laws ’ to match devolved powers for @entity15 , which have been promised now the @entity15 have voted to reject independence			1
he accused @entity10 of ‘ overriding ’ the rights of the @entity24 – and warned it could lead to a fierce backlash			0
@entity4 voters say the three party leaders were ‘ panicked ’ into a last - minute pledge of more cash for @entity15 because they feared @entity37 and the @entity38 were heading for victory			1
@entity10 reacted furiously to mr @entity0 ’s new attack on mr @entity2			1
they believe his ‘ @entity4 votes for @entity4 laws ’ plan is a @entity18 trap – because it would mean scrapping the voting rights of 41 @entity46 at @entity47 , potentially wrecking mr @entity2 ’s hopes of forming a government			1
in effect , mr @entity0 is turning the row into a personal battle with mr @entity2 to prove which of them stands up for @entity4			2
in a hard - hitting article for today ’s @entity30 , mr @entity0 says : ‘ the challenge to labour and @entity2 is clear : either resolve this issue with us , or explain to the people of the rest of the @entity60 why they should n’t have the same powers as we are devolving to the people of @entity15 – why , for instance , @entity15 mps should be able to vote to vary income tax rates in @entity4 , when the @entity66 is going to be setting @entity15 income tax rates in @entity15			1
’ a @entity10 aide accused mr @entity0 of ‘ cynicism ’ – and said his package of measures had been ‘ drawn up on the back of a fag packet ’			1
but @entity18 chiefs are convinced they have forced mr @entity2 on to the back foot with the surprise move to tie extra money and home rule for @entity15 to similar measures for @entity4 and @entity80			1
@entity63 have waded in , claiming mr @entity2 must do more to show he is ‘ pro-english ’			2
in a message aimed directly at mr @entity2 , mr @entity0 writes in @entity30 : ‘ millions of people in the rest of the @entity60 have been asking : “ why ca n’t we have the same powers and rights as @entity15 ? ” ‘ why should @entity15 mps be able to vote on @entity4 schools , @entity4 hospitals , @entity4 or @entity80 income taxes , when @entity4 or @entity80 mps would have no say in such matters in @entity15 ? it is fundamentally unjust to have the views of the people of @entity4 and @entity80 overridden in this way			1
@entity10 reacted furiously to mr @entity0 ’s new attack on mr @entity2 , who is in @entity97 for the party 's conference this weekend mr @entity0 will host an ‘ @entity4 votes for @entity4 laws ’ summit at his official country residence @entity100 on monday			1
he has invited senior @entity18 mps including @entity106 ( pictured ) and @entity107 there was a ‘ crying need ’ for @entity4 and @entity80 not to be discriminated against , he argued , adding that if the rights of the @entity4 and @entity80 were trampled on it could lead to serious trouble			2
the ‘ @entity4 question ’ was ‘ a basic unfairness at the heart of our democracy ’ – and must be put right			0
mr @entity0 will host an ‘ @entity4 votes for @entity4 laws ’ summit at his official country residence @entity100 tomorrow			1
he has invited senior @entity18 mps including @entity106 , who has led the campaign for a new @entity4 @entity66 , and conservative grandees @entity121 and @entity123 to discuss the issue with cabinet ministers @entity107 and @entity125			0
mr @entity37 yesterday claimed mr @entity0 had already started to go back on his vow to give @entity15 a better deal , saying people had been ‘ tricked by @entity47 into believing there would be an immediate offer of extra powers … and within 24 hours of the polls closing they start to tear up the commitments			2
’ the @entity18 - @entity10 feud came as it emerged @entity136 is poised to quit politics after being upstaged by his old boss @entity138 in the ‘ no ’ campaign			0
the former @entity10 chancellor says he will decide soon whether to resign from his @entity142 seat at the next election			0
@entity136 led the no camp to victory in thursday ’s referendum , but was eclipsed in the last days of the campaign by mr @entity148 mr @entity136 led the no camp to victory in thursday ’s referendum , but was eclipsed by mr @entity138 , whose passionate oratory was credited with winning over wavering @entity152 supporters			0
it was particularly galling for mr @entity136 , 60 , who until a few weeks ago had barely been on speaking terms with mr @entity138 since falling out over how to handle the economic crisis when they were in power			0
asked if he would stand again , mr @entity136 – who has been tipped for a possible return to the front bench in a reshuffle later this month – said : ‘ i am making my mind up			0
’ the news came as mr @entity138 gave another barnstorming speech in which he promised to force @entity47 to stick to its promise of extra devolution for the @entity15 – and dispelled any speculation about his own future by saying that he was ‘ too old to be the comeback kid and too young to be an elder statesman ’			0
mr @entity138 , 63 , said ‘ the eyes of the world ’ were on the party leaders in @entity47 over the pledge to give the @entity15 greater devolution			2
‘ these are men who have been promise makers and they will not be promise breakers , ’ the former prime minister said			0
