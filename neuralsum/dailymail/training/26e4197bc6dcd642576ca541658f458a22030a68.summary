by @entity0 questioned : @entity1 was confused by the unyielding attitude of a @entity4 employee who refused to let him cancel his service with the cable giant unless he gave him a good reason it seems that one @entity4 rep has decided on a brilliant new way to retain customers - never let them leave			1
that would most likely be confirmed by @entity1 , the co-founder of tech site @entity16 , who found himself enduring a torturous 18 minute interrogation of a phone call with a barking @entity4 employee who demanded to know why he wanted to choose another cable provider			1
astounded by the rep who simply and rudely would not take no for an answer , @entity1 shared eight minutes of the infuriating conversation online for all to hear - which prompted an ' embarrassed ' @entity4 to issue a full and unreserved apology			1
all @entity1 wanted to do was cancel , but the as - yet unidentified @entity4 rep flat - out refused to go - ahead with the @entity30 product manager 's disconnection unless he got a reason - which @entity1 was not obliged to give			1
' why is it that you do n't want the faster speed ? help me understand why you do n't want faster @entity36 ? ' demands the @entity4 rep in one portion of the call after @entity1 asks to cancel his service			1
even though technically it is a sales rep 's job to stop a customer leaving , bluntly questioning them when they clearly want to is not wise			0
scroll down for @entity46 normal procedure ? @entity1 took to @entity48 on monday to ask whether he should post the partial recording of the 18 minute phone call he and his wife had with the @entity4 employee here he goes : @entity1 decided that he was going to shame the @entity4 employee but was careful to leave out any means of identification via his name or @entity56 ' my job is to have a conversation with you about keeping your service , ' the @entity4 employee can be heard to say on the eight - minute recording which @entity1 first uploaded to @entity64 on monday			1
despite @entity1 being adamant that he wanted to cancel , the employee told him that he had to be given a good reason or he would n't do it			2
this ' rude , unhelpful and condescending ' behavior was ' straight up belligerent ' according to a stunned @entity1			2
indeed , only eight minutes were recorded because @entity1 's wife was on the phone to the rep for the first ten , during which he acted in the same way to her			1
' i started the call by ( very nicely ) saying that we were moving , and that we needed to cancel our service , ' @entity1 's wife , @entity74 , wrote in the description of the recording on @entity64			1
' he asked if we wanted to move our current service			0
i said no , thank you , but we ’ve already signed up for @entity82			0
' overwhelmed : @entity1 was quickly told by the online community that he was not overreacting to the attitude of the @entity4 rep sympathy : @entity1 acknowledged that as a member of the tech community he understood that it was sometimes hard to get the right tone over the phone ' the representative continued aggressively repeating his questions , despite the answers given , to the point where my wife became so visibly upset she handed me the phone , ' @entity1 wrote in the audio description			1
' overhearing the conversation , i knew this would not be very fun			0
' ' what i did not know is how oppressive this conversation would be			0
within just a few minutes the representative had gotten so condescending and unhelpful i felt compelled to record the speakerphone conversation on my other phone			2
' this recording picks up roughly 10 minutes into the call , whereby she and i have already played along and given a myriad of reasons and explanations as to why we are canceling ( which is why i simply stopped answering the rep ’s repeated question — it was clear the only sufficient answer was ‘ okay , please do n’t disconnect our service after all			2
' response : @entity4 replied to @entity1 on tuesday that they were mortified and embarrassed by the conduct of their staff member exasperated , @entity1 's conversation goes from frustrating to weird , to surreal			1
' why is it you do n't want faster speed ? help me understand why you do n't want faster internet ? ' the rep asks			0
' help me understand why you ca n't just disconnect us ? ' @entity1 answers			2
@entity1 then tries to tell the rep repeatedly that he has no intention of giving him a reason and does not owe @entity4 any explanation			1
to that , the rep tries a different tact and claims that he only wants to help			0
' the way you can help me is by disconnecting our service , ' @entity1 said			2
' but how is that helping you though ? ' the rep replies			0
' that 's what i want , ' @entity1 replies			0
' ok , why is that what you want ? ' the employee counters with			0
@entity1 tries one more time , demanding to know one thing : ' are you capable by phone of disconnecting our service ? ' ' it 's something we can do			1
i mean , very rarely do we do it , ' the rep says			0
cable and @entity36 giant @entity4 is apologizing after a tech - savvy @entity157 customer posted eight minutes of telephone conversation online in which he tried repeatedly to get a customer service representative to disconnect his service bigger man : @entity1 accepted their apology and told them not to fire the person responsible after the rep started quizzing @entity1 about his new provider like a jealous partner , @entity1 suddenly thinks something might not be right			1
' am i being punked ? ' askes block - meaing is the whole thing a joke ? after six minutes of conversation the rep relents and claims he will disconnect the service , but not before the damage had been done			2
@entity4 's senior vice president of customer experience , @entity178 , issued a statement on tuesday to apologize after the company was ' embarrassed by the way our employee ' spoke to @entity1			1
' the way in which our representative communicated with him is unacceptable and not consistent with how we train our customer service representatives			0
we are investigating this situation and will take quick action , ' the statement said			0
' while the overwhelming majority of our employees work very hard to do the right thing every day , we are using this very unfortunate experience to reinforce how important it is to always treat our customers with the utmost respect			0
