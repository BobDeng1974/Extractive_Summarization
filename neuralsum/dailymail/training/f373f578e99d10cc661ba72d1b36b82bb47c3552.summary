but while treating ourselves to something nice may improve our mood briefly , new research from the @entity11 suggests that shopping as a cure for loneliness is futile - and could in fact make us feel more lonely			1
in fact , the very act of fending off loneliness by shopping can create a vicious cycle where one shops because they are lonely , feels more lonely because they have shopped , and continues shopping in a misguided attempt to cure the loneliness			2
the study , published in the @entity25 , analysed data from 2,500 consumers over six years and found that while loneliness does indeed contribute to materialism , the two have a bidirectional relationship			0
defining materialism as the ‘ importance consumers attach to acquiring and owning material possessions ’ the study proposes that materialism can ‘ crowd out ’ social relationships and thus increase loneliness , which in turn increases materialism as a coping strategy			0
before you throw out your credit card though , it is worth noting that the researchers found this vicious cycle only applied to two of the three sub-types of materialism : ‘ acquisition as source of happiness ’ ( where material possessions are a means to your happiness ; you buy things in an attempt to fill an inner void of happiness ) and ‘ possession - defined success ’ ( using material things as a yardstick to measure how well you ’re doing in life in comparison to other people ) both increased loneliness over time			1
however the third type of materialism ‘ acquisition centrality ’ ( buying nice or luxury things simply because owning them makes you happy ) in fact decreased loneliness			1
similarly , while being lonely increased both the first two types of materialism , it had no effect on acquisition centrality			0
the subtype of materialism ' acquisition centrality ' can actually decrease your sense of loneliness - so just make sure you are shopping for the right reasons ! if buying a new designer dress makes us happy because it 's beautiful and we enjoyed choosing it , for instance , then the purchase may have the effect of making us feel somewhat less lonely			2
however if we expect the dress to cure an inner sense of unhappiness , or we want it to show friends and colleagues how well we are doing , then buying it may ultimately lead to us feeling more lost and lonely than before the shopping trip			0
so while the study points at a wisdom in evaluating why we shop , it does not necessarily mean that we are all susceptible to the same pernicious cycle of materialism and loneliness .			0

research by @entity11 shows we shop when we are lonely
also showed that materialism increased loneliness for most
*identified* three sub-types of materialism , two of which make you more lonely
shopping to fill a void , or to impress others can make you lonely
those who shop purely for the pleasure of owning nice things are ok
