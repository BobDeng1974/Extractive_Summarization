patients should be able to dodge the waiting room queue if they eat their five - a - day a think - tank has suggested in a report today , it makes a number of controversial recommendations to encourage the public to take responsibility for their own health			2
the authors point out that the current system is unfair , as patients who do n’t make any attempt to be healthy are more likely to need the @entity5 ’s scarce resources			1
instead , the think - tank wants to encourage the public to take regular exercise and eat more fruit and vegetables by rewarding them for doing so			2
one suggestion is to allow patients to earn points by going to the gym or buying certain healthy foods at the supermarket			1
these could then be used by doctors to assess whether they deserved priority treatment on the @entity5			1
another is to reward patients on benefits with cash top - ups if they could prove they had been to the gym or bought fruit and veg			0

‘ government and the private sector should adopt an enabling and pro-active approach to supporting individuals , families and communities into doing the right thing and taking more responsibility			0
‘ it is no longer enough to simply step back and assume people will fill the gap			0
‘ polling has consistently shown this view strikes a chord with the general public , and these nudge - plus proposals offer some practical idea of how we could see it in action			0
’ the government has been criticised for failing to do enough to tackle obesity with the likes of tv chef @entity102 describing policies as ‘ utterly inadequate ’			0
other campaigners have accused ministers of ‘ cosying up ’ to the food industry by allowing them to set their own rules to limit salt , sugar and fat .			0
