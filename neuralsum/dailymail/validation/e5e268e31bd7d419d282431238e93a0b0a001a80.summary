a man who has not been in @entity1 is always conscious of an inferiority , from not having seen what it is expected a man should see			2
so said @entity6 , who was forever ready with a suitable aphorism			2
suitable , that is , if you were living in the 18th century , when the rich and titled minority wafted around @entity12 and @entity13 as part of their @entity15 , allowing travel to broaden their minds before bringing back new ideas to influence our architecture , landscape and gardening			2
the cities they visited overflowed with statues and art , some of which they bought on the cheap , or pinched when the @entity1 were looking the other way			2
though @entity32 can sometimes seem overcrowded , it ’s still possible to return with plenty of treasured memories ( pictured : @entity35 and its towers ) @entity6 would be surprised to see how popular @entity1 cities have become nowadays : visitors are well advised to arrive outside the summer peak when sightseeing can be hard ( and sometimes positively dangerous given the rise of the selfie - stick – the ultimate stupidity of modern - day tourism )			1
@entity45 took a wry look at the early days of mass tourism to @entity1 at the end of the @entity49 in @entity50			0
when the young heroine @entity50 finds herself in the church of @entity53 without her @entity55 guidebook , @entity45 is expressing the horror of the intellectual at the worrying rise of the ‘ uneducated ’ tourist			0
he went so far as to wonder whether there ought to be some sort of intelligence test imposed at @entity63 to weed out the truly stupid traveller			0
but today ’s tourists do n’t come to @entity32 so much to learn as to ‘ experience ’			1
the treasures of the @entity68 or an up - close sight of @entity70 in @entity12 ’s @entity71 are stirring in their own right – you do n’t really need to know their place in the history of @entity76 in order to enjoy them			1
@entity79 was called @entity80 by the @entity81 , and they made use of its thermal springs in @entity12 you can assimilate the art and savour it , just as you might imbibe a glass of fine @entity1 wine			1
the problem is that at busy times , it ’s hard to find the space to enjoy either the art or the wine			1
but though @entity32 can sometimes seem overcrowded , it ’s still possible to return with plenty of treasured memories			1
mine are of a pleasant three - star hotel in a place named @entity79 , about 50 miles south - east of @entity99 , which was our base			1
the @entity81 called it @entity103 , and made use of its thermal springs , as visitors still do			1
i have good memories , too , of the @entity32 landscape , with its well - tended fields and vineyards , its olive groves and cypress trees			1
i like being in a countryside that has not been neglected , or turned into a theme park for townies			0
in this regard , @entity32 is rewarding			1
the ‘ @entity118 ’ area , which lies between @entity12 and @entity99 , still looks much as it was when it was painted by the great @entity76 artists who assumed that the @entity120 must have looked a lot like @entity32 – so this is what you see in the background of various scenes of holy birth and crucifixion			1
as you pass through this land , you enjoy divine views across glorious sprawling vineyards ; a view occasionally interrupted by stunningly picturesque castles			0
writer @entity135 's tour leader called @entity32 's @entity136 ' a medieval @entity137 ' of course , other countries have beautiful landscapes , but few can match @entity32 for its sublime , gentle sweetness			1
@entity141 was born in the small town of @entity143 which lies in this magnificent scenery – a final confirmation that the area is touched by genius			1
we ate well , naturally , and drank moderately well , too			0
some of my fellow travellers discovered a red wine named @entity152 , which they found most acceptable			0
our base was just five miles or so from @entity152 , so supplies were guaranteed			0
we went to @entity35 , which our tour leader called ‘ a medieval @entity137 ’ – and it was n’t the first time i ’d heard it described that way , unfortunately			1
its towers are most impressive , though it seems to take a greater pride in its ice cream			0
we liked @entity35 , mainly because there were n’t so many people , but also because we were left to our own devices and could make up our own minds about the place without being told all sorts of stuff by a local guide			1
i ’m in two minds about local guides			0
they do tell you lots of useful things , but have a tendency to tell you too much , so everything blurs			0
@entity176 ( travelsphere.co.uk , 0800 987 5110 ) offers and eight - day treasures of @entity32 tour with prices starting from £ 604			1
this includes return flights from @entity182 , transfers , half - board , accommodation , transport and some excursions			2
@entity12 provided a good example of this			0
the guide there told us about artists and sculptors and architects and the ruling families of medieval times			2
she gave the names of the buildings and their histories			0
and dates ; masses of dates			0
at the end of it all , i was most confused			0
but the guide never mentioned the @entity12 that might have made @entity209 visitors prick up their ears			2
indeed , she had never even heard of @entity212 who was born in that city and was given its name			0
the @entity212 family had a penchant for strange first names : @entity12 ’s elder sister @entity219 was called after an ancient name for @entity221 , where the family was living at the time of her birth			2
i suppose that both girls were glad that at the time of their births , the family had not been living in @entity227 …			0

it ’s possible to return from overcrowded @entity32 with treasured memories
the @entity81 made use of @entity79 's thermal springs
@entity35 , a small *walled* medieval town , is a popular *destination*
