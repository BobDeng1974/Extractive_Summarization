senior investigating officer pc @entity155 said he hoped the sentence would bring some comfort , and reminded drivers of their obligation to ' keep others safe '			2
how can i put into words what @entity11 meant to me and my family and the true impact of life without him ? on sunday november 17 , 2013 our lives were destroyed by the news that @entity11 , who had been cycling to work on the cycle path next to @entity173 , had been struck by a vehicle and had died at the scene			1
in that split second i realised that i had lost a husband of 23 years , my daughter @entity45 had lost her father and my sister - in - law had lost a brother			0
five months later we are in no better shape and everyday life is very painful and less worthwhile without @entity11 being there to share it with			1
i have had to leave my job due to ill health and i am struggling to cope with day - to - day life			0
i am trying to stay strong for my daughter but it is so hard			0
if there is a @entity116 , we are living it			0
@entity11 was a family man			1
he worked to live and would spend his time , when not with his family , out with friends at the club or enjoying one of his many hobbies			2
these included visiting the gun club , playing the bass guitar or just listening to his favourite music , loud			0
@entity11 was a joiner by trade but had recently gone to work as a security officer			1
everything he did , he did safely and by the book			0
when riding his bike he would always wear a helmet and the appropriate clothing , and ensure his bike was properly maintained with correctly fitted lights			0
he had recently signed up to be a volunteer fireman and was so proud when he had passed the driving test which enabled him to drive the fire tenders			0
he would frequently visit his sister @entity215 and do odd jobs around her house just to help			0
@entity11 would often be in his front room and i would be in the tv room to the rear of our house			2
although we were in separate rooms doing different things , i still felt close to him and knew he would be there for me if i needed him			0
in some ways @entity45 has been hit hardest by this tragedy			0
she misses her father so much and is in a continuous state of panic that something terrible is also going to happen to me			0
she has to remain in constant contact with me to ensure that i am safe			0
she hardly sleeps , eats and is struggling to maintain her job			0
nightmares are frequent as are the panic attacks			0
we are still all very bitter and angry that someone has taken a huge part of our life away			0
we all agree that the person responsible for killing @entity11 did not intend to do so , but nevertheless it has occurred and we would like him to be severely punished to the full extent of the law			1
this will not bring @entity11 back but it will show that the actions of one man can destroy the lives of so many and that this behaviour is not acceptable and will not be tolerated .			2

@entity5 was driving dangerously before crashing truck
@entity11 , 55 , was catapulted from his bike and died instantly
*victim* was on a cyclepath and ' should have been entirely safe ' from harm
likely that text message sent by @entity5 contributed to the fatal crash

' destroyed ' family had called for the driver to be ' severely punished '
