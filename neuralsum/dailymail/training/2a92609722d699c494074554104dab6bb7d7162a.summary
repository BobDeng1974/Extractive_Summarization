a husband has been banned from having sex with his wife by a high court judge because she does not know she can refuse his advances , it was revealed yesterday			1
the unidentified @entity7 man , who lives in east @entity8 , claimed he has the right under his @entity11 culture to have sex with the mentally - disabled woman aged 39 whenever he pleases			1
he has already taken the wife 's cousin as a second ‘ wife ’ in a polygamous @entity11 marriage and had two children with her - although still demands the right to have sex with his first wife			1
judgment : a judge at the @entity22 ( pictured ) in @entity8 said the man wanted his wife to come home so he could have sex with his two spouses on alternate days but with a mental age of four to eight , the wife - identified only as ‘ @entity29 ’ - has been taken into care under the @entity31 by the @entity32 where the family lived			1
all their four children have also been taken into care because she does not have the ability to care for them			2
but the husband - sa - married to her for 18 years , wanted her back home			1
a family division judge refused this in an anonymised judgment released yesterday			2
mr @entity45 said : ‘ the evidence clearly shows that @entity29 has barely an inkling of the health risks involved			0
she was unable to link sex to pregnancy			2
‘ indeed she had virtually no idea how her babies came to be in her tummy ( as she put it )			0
although she found sex enjoyable and comfortable she had no idea that she had a choice and could refuse			0
‘ indeed the attitude of @entity58 , based , as he told me on his culture and religion , was that he had a right to seek sex from her and that it was her duty to submit			0
’ the judge said efforts to enlighten @entity29 about sex , her rights , and the risks involved had failed			2
he added : ‘ it is doubtful that @entity29 has ever had the capacity to decide to have sex , notwithstanding that she has had four children			0
’ important case : the wife - identified only as ‘ tb ’ - has been taken into care under the @entity31 by the @entity32 ( whose headquarters are pictured , centre ) where the family lived the couple had a ‘ volatile ’ relationship and there were instances of domestic violence when the husband lost his temper			1
after their elder children had been taken into care the judge said it was ‘ heartless ’ of the husband to make her pregnant again knowing the child would be taken away at birth			1
the judge said : ‘ sex is a , if not the , basic animal instinct			2
it is a very powerful instinct			0
without it animal ( or any ) life would not exist			0
‘ nature has made it intensely pleasurable in order to seek to ensure the propagation of the species			0
most physically fit humans are mechanically capable of engaging in sex irrespective of their mental capacity			0
‘ although it is a powerful instinct ( i myself would not describe it as visceral ) it still requires a positive choice and society demands that that choice is freely exercised by both parties			0
‘ our modern society views with repugnance and amazement those barbarous relics that once said , for example , that a man can force sex on his wife			1
’ her husband wanted her to come home so he could have sex with his two wives on alternate days , said the judge			1
he added : ' the right to family life is a qualified right and the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that it is in her best interests that she should live apart from sa. for this reason also it is necessary that @entity58 's right to a family life is compromised			0
’ he also declared that she did not have the capacity to consent to sex and should be held in accommodation where she received 24 - hour care , with the situation reviewed every six months			2
the judge said the polygamous marriage was valid under @entity11 law but invalid in the @entity147 .			1
