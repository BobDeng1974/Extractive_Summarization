a second ambulance trust suspected of secretly downgrading emergency calls last night admitted it had reclassified 11,000 patients			1
@entity3 said some 10,918 calls were re-categorised as less serious last year – 30 a day			1
it follows a report that revealed how the @entity7 changed the status of 8,324 calls in a two - month period last year to meet response times			1
it was accused of hastening the deaths of 57 terminally ill patients by downgrading 999 calls so ambulances either arrived too late or not at all			1
one whistleblower told the @entity29 : ‘ some absolutely major calls are being graded as green [ less serious ] because they know they are not going to get to it			1
’ another paramedic said : ‘ they are playing with lives on a daily basis			2
’ the ambulance service – which serves a population of five million – is under pressure to meet targets as it attempts to become a cherished ‘ foundation trust ’ with less state control			1
figures reveal how 348 of 722 life - threatening ‘ @entity46 ’ calls were reclassified as less serious ‘ @entity47 ’			1
that meant patients still had an eight - minute response target but a delay is factored into the timing			2
another 374 calls were downgraded to ‘ green ’ , meaning a response time of between 20 or 50 minutes – or simply advice over the phone			1
@entity56 – which uncovered the figures – said more than 500 staff and members of the public have now complained to the @entity62 watchdog			2
@entity63 , general secretary of the union , said : ‘ there needs to be a thorough investigation into allegations that the service could be gambling with people ’s lives			2
senior management at the @entity72 have a record of systemic failure , incompetence and are mired in allegations of cover - ups			2
’ @entity79 mp @entity78 , who sits on the @entity81 health select committee , said : ‘ politicians of all parties need to grow up and realise targets are damaging			1
’ paramedics claim control room staff are instructed to ring patients back if it becomes clear the ambulance is not going to reach them on time			1
staff then carry out a phone assessment where it is ‘ agreed ’ that callers are not critically ill so an ambulance is not needed as quickly			2
a grandfather spent nearly three days in a cramped hospital stock room because no space was available on a ward			0
@entity99 , 63 , right , was squeezed into a storage area filled with medical supplies and lit by a glaring fluorescent strip light			0
he struggled to sleep because of constant interruptions as staff came in to grab equipment or move his bed to reach a drugs cupboard			0
mr @entity99 , who was being treated for an inflamed liver , also claimed other patients were left to go hungry by overstretched nurses			0
he helped feed and comfort some , including one severely ill man who died as he held his hand			0
‘ it beggars belief that something like this can happen in this day and age – people do n’t believe it when i tell them , ’ he said			1
the retired salesman was admitted to @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity122 , twice last month			0
the second time he was moved to the 12ft by 10ft stock room and given intravenous antibiotics			1
the hospital trust has apologised to mr @entity99 , saying it was struggling with an ‘ unprecedented number of emergency patients ’			0
it rejected the hungry patient claims			0
however , the @entity19 trust insists that patients are only called back when it might be ‘ beneficial ’ and they are then offered the most ‘ appropriate care ’			0
at the @entity7 trust , managers agreed beforehand that certain calls involving terminally ill patients would not be deemed as serious – forcing them to wait up to 50 minutes or simply receiving advice over the phone			2
yesterday @entity141 described the actions of the ambulance service in @entity144 as ‘ clearly wrong ’			0
he told mps : ‘ the change was made without the knowledge of the trust ’s board			0
as soon as it was found out , the chief executive reversed the decision and ordered an independent investigation			0
the investigation found there had been no harm to patients			0
i think it is important to put this in context			0
’ however , campaigners dispute the finding of the investigation and say terminally ill patients may have had precious extra time with loved ones had ambulances been dispatched .			1
