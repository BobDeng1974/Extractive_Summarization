at @entity1 , @entity0 has established a reputation for his impeccable manners and his work - rate on the training ground			1
at 36 , with three @entity9 titles , four @entity10 and the biggest one of the lot - the @entity13 - his appetite for the game is undiminished			1
that much was made clear when he was summoned from the substitutes bench by @entity16 to score @entity1 ’s equaliser against his former club @entity18 on sunday			1
@entity0 looked close to tears after scoring the equalising goal for @entity1 against @entity18 @entity0 was all smiles as he left the @entity25 restaurant in @entity27 's city centre @entity0 ( left ) was joined by his fiancee @entity28 ( right ) for the meal on sunday night the happy couple leave @entity25 restaurant just before 11pm on sunday after scoring his first goal for @entity1 against former club @entity18 , the @entity33 legend may not have felt like celebrating - but that did n't stop @entity0 enjoying an evening out on sunday night			1
@entity0 dined at @entity27 restaurant @entity25 with fiancee @entity28 and seemed to be in high spirits despite taking two points away from his beloved @entity18 in sunday 's 1 - 1 draw at the @entity39			1
before @entity0 arrived , @entity1 staff knew the stories about his extra shuttle runs after training and his dedication to the game during his career with @entity18 and @entity47			1
even during the @entity50 , when @entity0 was on the fringes of the team , he would sit down at @entity47 ’s @entity52 training when he was waiting his turn in the ball drills and do sit ups			2
the former @entity18 star scored against his old club to help @entity1 to a 1 - 1 draw against the @entity59 lampard slots home from inside the penalty area to send the @entity1 fans into ecstasy against his old club @entity0 refuses to celebrate after equalising for @entity1 against the club he represented for 13 years @entity0 arrives late in the box to score @entity1 's equaliser and deny @entity18 three points at the @entity39 @entity71 deal extended it was a small thing , a minor detail , but he was the only @entity47 player doing it			1
that discipline was instilled at a young age , when he chose to ignore the taunts of @entity78 , one of the promising players coming through the youth set up with him at @entity81			0
‘ @entity82 , @entity0 , what the * * * * are you doing ? ’ @entity78 shouted across when he saw the young midfielder out on his own after training doing his doggies			0
it got a laugh from the other players and @entity0 has never forgotten it			0
to this day , he still does them			0
when he is off the training field and away with the team , he spends time plotting the next move in the @entity95 property market			0
the 36 - year - old holds his hands up and looks to the skies after scoring what must have been an emotional goal for the former @entity18 man between him and his dad , @entity102 , they own half of the capital , or at least it seems that way			1
they are family who have always planned for the future			0
@entity0 could have taken the easy route during his loan spell at @entity1 , going through the motions and keeping himself ticking over until he starts his new career with @entity113			2
instead he has even surprised @entity1 ’s manager @entity16 with his exceptional attitude and commitment to the game			0
at the @entity50 , even though he knew he was no longer a first - choice midfield player , @entity0 took on extra responsibilities			2
@entity0 was a dedicated servant to his national team , earning 106 caps and scoring 29 goals for @entity47 the @entity18 legend celebrates scoring his record breaking 203rd goal for the @entity9 club @entity0 poses for a photoshoot with a load of footballs after breaking the @entity18 goalscoring record he was a comfort blanket for many of the players , an emotional crutch for the youngsters in @entity135 ’s @entity47 squad			1
when he spoke with the media , he held the room so well - particularly once when he sat with @entity138 - that he sounded like the manager			0
one day he should be			0
he has all the requirements			0
@entity0 ( left ) won everything with @entity18 , including the @entity9 title in 2005 starting out at @entity81 , @entity0 went on to spend 13 happy years at @entity33 @entity0 is a smart guy , responding in @entity143 to a @entity1 official who had also studied the language when they were at school			1
@entity147 is @entity0 ’s first language , though			0
he wanted to play on sunday - in any event @entity9 rules meant he had to be available - and there was never any doubt that he would give anything other than 100 per cent			2
when he steered @entity1 ’s equaliser beyond @entity155 , he was respectful and dignified , but that goal meant more than many of the 211 he scored in a @entity18 shirt			1
it proved to @entity0 that he could still live with the game at this level			0
@entity0 may have scored for @entity1 on sunday , but the midfielder will always be a @entity18 hero ‘ i do n’t speak about former players , ’ was @entity163 ’s narky response following @entity0 ’s incredible impact on the game at the @entity39			1
it was @entity163 ’s decision to let @entity0 leave when @entity168 let it be known that @entity170 were prepared to sell him			2
during those fabulous tussles between the pair , when @entity168 was the chirpy upstart in an @entity176 shirt and @entity0 was the main man in @entity18 ’s midfield , they never got along			2
it was obvious , watching @entity0 ’s body language and demeanour , that he was determined to impose himself in every area of the midfield during those combative and compelling clashes			0
in all those fights , @entity168 never got the better of the @entity185 in the centre of midfield			0
even at 36 , @entity0 still dedicates more time on the training field than most other players @entity190 fires @entity18 ahead in the clash of the title rivals at the @entity39 on sunday on sunday , @entity0 still had the upper hand after coming on to score that equaliser when @entity1 were down to 10 men			1
he is sensible enough to know that this can not last for ever , that his time as a top class @entity9 player will come to an end when he leaves for @entity113 in january			2
when the @entity1 option came up - initially he was supposed to play for @entity203 ’s team in @entity204 - he spoke with his father about his emotional attachment to @entity18			1
@entity0 will have wanted to get the upper hand of @entity18 midfielder @entity168 ( centre ) it was pointed out to him that the great @entity210 , who was idolised by @entity211 as a young professional at @entity81 , went on to play for @entity213 later in his career			1
he was still , quite rightly , cherished down at the @entity215			0
@entity216 , as he is known at @entity33 - is @entity18 through and through			2
despite his goal on sunday , they are still his team .			0

@entity0 is the *ultimate* professional and @entity18 will always be his club
@entity0 scored debut goal for @entity1 against @entity59 on sunday
former @entity18 star dined out with fiancee @entity28
