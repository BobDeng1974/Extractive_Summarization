by @entity0 published : 13:51 est , 18 february 2014 @entity2 : 15:06 est , 18 february 2014 as romantic gestures go , providing a cow to take his bride to the wedding is not one of those that is likely to catch on			0
while most women dream of arriving for the biggest day of their lives in a vintage car or horse - drawn carriage groom @entity15 , 37 , had other plans for when he wed @entity18 , 35 , in @entity19			1
the groom said he had always been fascinated by the love story of the poor cowherd @entity22 from ancient mythology and wanted it to feature in the ceremony			1
@entity18 , 35 , arriving for her wedding on a cow			2
the unconventional arrival was inspired by a story from @entity19 legend @entity32 , 37 , said he had always been fascinated by the story from @entity19 legend of the poor cowherd @entity22 he said : ' i wanted to have the cow bring her to our wedding because i will be her @entity22 , and i will love her for all eternity with my heart and soul			1
' according to the legend @entity22 was told by a cow where he would be able to witness the emperor of heaven 's seven daughters come down to earth to bathe			0
the beautiful woman on a cow is one of the images of the @entity50 captivated by the beauty of the youngest daughter , responsible for weaving the rainbows in the sky , he stole her fairy clothes so that she was unable to fly back to heaven			1
and @entity22 only agreed to return them if she promised to become his wife , and she accepted and the couple married and had two children			0
but the emperor of heaven found out why the sky no longer had its rainbows and took his daughter back into heaven , although after listening to her pleas he agreed to allow her to see her husband one day every year - where she would be carried across a rainbow on the back of a cow			0
the beautiful woman on a cow is one of the images of the @entity50 but it is never really taken off as a means of transport to the wedding , and although reluctant bride @entity18 , 35 , agreed to be transported to the wedding using the unusual mode of transport			1
the significance of the cow is that it was originally this animal that told @entity22 where he would be able to view the @entity86 's daughters bathing			2
@entity50 , known as @entity50 , takes place on a different day each year but always around the middle of august			0
traditionally young people would go to a temple to pray for help finding a suitable partner although contemporary celebrations take a more @entity95 form .			0

@entity15 arranged for wife - to - be @entity18 to arrive on the animal in @entity19
a beautiful woman on a cow is one of the images of @entity50 but the cow is rarely adopted as wedding transport
the idea comes from the story of a poor cowherd called @entity22
