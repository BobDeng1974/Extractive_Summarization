are you one of those people who ca n't leave a pimple alone - even though you know your skin will look red and sore afterwards ? now , one doctor has revealed the best way to attack blemishes - and claims this method wo n't hurt			1
appearing on the @entity11 show , dr @entity9 said up to one in five of us are obsessed with picking blemishes , but most of us go about it completely the wrong way			1
' never squeeze a pimple because you will macerate it , ' he said			1
instead , use a needle cleaned with alcohol ' what 's important is to not jab the needle in ' , he says			1
instead , place the needle parallel to the skin - rather like you would skewer something - and pierce the skin across he went on to explain that the technique many of us adopt - pressing the healthy skin around the spot - actually damages it			1
' you 're destroying all the healthy tissue with the pressure you are putting on there by squeezing			0
' using a revolting - looking giant blemish as a prop , he continued : ' the pimple is the body trying to push way the pus			1
' rather than prodding away at the skin with dirty fingers , he advised using a needle that has been cleaned with alcohol			1
' what 's important is to not jab it in ' , he says - referring to the technique many of us use			0
instead , place the needle parallel to the skin - rather like you would skewer something - and pierce the skin from one side to another			1
' then , rip up , ' he declared			0
' you only want to hit the white part of the pimple - because that bit is already dead , ' he said			2
here , there is no sensation , but if you jab the needle in front ways , you will soon hit a part of the spot that is n't dead - and that will hurt			2
the parallel technique also wo n't cause any damage to the surrounding , healthy skin , he added			1
' then , rip up , ' he declares			0
' you only want to hit the white part of the pimple - because that bit is already dead ' ripping up means you 're attacking a bit where there is no sensation			2
but if you jab the needle in front ways , you will soon hit a part of the spot that is n't dead - and that will hurt			2
the parallel technique also wo n't cause any damage to the surrounding , healthy skin , he adds			1
last year , scientists discovered why some people are more prone to spots than others			0
the researchers , from @entity97 , said the key was finding out more about the bacteria that live on the skin and cause acne			0
this bacteria contains ‘ bad ’ strains which cause pimples and ‘ good ’ ones that may protect the skin			0
having too much ' bad ' bacteria is what causes spots , they say			0
this is rather like an imbalance of good and bad bacteria in the gut causing digestive issues			0
it is not yet clear why some people have more of either type of bacteria , or what comes first - the acne or the bacteria			0
other factors , such as an individual 's genetic make - up or the sensitivity of their immune system , may also dictate whether good or bad strains grow on skin .			2

' never squeeze a pimple because you will macerate it , ' said dr @entity9
and pressing the healthy skin around the spot also damages it
instead , use a needle cleaned with alcohol and attack the spot *sideways*
then , rip *outwards* to draw the pus out - and not damage any healthy skin
