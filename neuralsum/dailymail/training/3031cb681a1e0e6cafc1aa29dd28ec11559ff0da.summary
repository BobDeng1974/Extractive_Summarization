according to a story in the college paper the @entity14 , the trouble started for ' @entity15 ' ( not her real name ) when fellow college freshman @entity17 came up to her and asked her if she was the same girl as the adult film star he 'd been watching			1
@entity15 admitted that she acted in pornographic films under a stage name , but swore him to secrecy			2
exposed : in an interview with the campus newspaper , @entity15 called her porn career empowering for his part , @entity17 denies having recognized her in porn , telling the @entity27 that she actually confessed her secret to him			1
both agree that despite his promise , @entity17 blabbed at his next fraternity rush event			1
once he leaked the secret , people across campus were texting and tweeting about the @entity5 freshman porn star within a matter of days			1
the aspiring lawyer was crudely mocked and attacked online			2
' if you b * * * ed her , report in , ' wrote one anonymous poster on the @entity42 message board			0
' we going to pretend like she was unaware of the social consequences of going into that business ? she made a decision , now she needs to live with the consequences , ' wrote another			0
she soon found herself talking to the campus newspaper about her life in porn , which @entity15 would later call an attempt to control the conversation			1
in that interview , @entity15 said she started in adult films as a way to offset her massive tuition bills , and called the @entity5 campus a place where women had to hide their sexuality , and were held to a ' virgin - wh * * * dichotomy			1
' in that story , the author took note of @entity15 's ' designer bag ' and new @entity67 as proof of her porn - riches			1
higher learning : @entity5 students took to the internet to criticize @entity15 's career choices and speculate who might have had sex with her however , @entity15 was n't entirely pleased with the @entity14 's representation			1
while she thanked them for giving her a forum she also accused them of skewing her words and betraying her trust in a response on the blog @entity83 , adding that they had ' portrayed me as a @entity86 , attention seeking little girl who flaunts her wealth			0
' she went even further detailing her life in pornography and the lack of impact she expects it to have on her future in a first - hand account published on @entity97			0
' i could n't afford $ 60,000 in tuition , my family has undergone significant financial burden , and i saw a way to graduate from my dream school free of debt , doing something i absolutely love , ' @entity15 wrote			2
' because to be clear : my experience in porn has been nothing but supportive , exciting , thrilling and empowering			2
' she further elaborated that the site she performed for was a ' rough sex website ' but that she had never been ' coerced or harmed ' while filming			0
' everyone has their kinks and we should not shame anyone for enjoying something that is perfectly legal and consensual for all parties involved , ' she wrote			0
first - hand : in an article on @entity97 , @entity15 said she had no fear of porn impacting her future career as she would n't want to work for anyone who held it against her ' for me , shooting pornography brings me unimaginable joy			1
when i finish a scene , i know that i have done so and completed an honest day 's work			0
it is my artistic outlet , my love , my happiness , my home			0
' finally , she shot back at critics who claimed she was being degraded : ' i can honestly say that i have never felt more empowered or happy doing anything else			0
' @entity15 also called for people to examine why they treated female sexuality ' with such disdain , ' and dismissed online comments that said her history would prevent her from finding work after graduation			2
' i wouldnâ € ™ t want to work for someone who discriminates against sex workers , ' she wrote .			0

' @entity15 ' was outed by a fellow student at a fraternity rush
was *harassed* online by @entity5 students as word *spread*
far from being degrading , she says her experience in porn has brought her ' unimaginable joy '
