by @entity1 reporter published : 12:18 est , 18 november 2013 @entity3 : 12:20 est , 18 november 2013 ancient viruses inherited from @entity5 have been found in modern human dna			1
scientists are investigating possible links between the ' endogenous retroviruses ' , which are hardwired into dna , and modern diseases such as aids and cancer			1
researchers compared dna from @entity5 and another group of ancient humans called @entity17 with that obtained from cancer patients			1
researchers compared dna from @entity5 ( skull , pictured ) and another group of ancient humans called @entity17 they found evidence of @entity5 and @entity17 viruses in the modern dna , suggesting that they originated in a common ancestor more than half a million years ago			1
neanderthals co-existed with our ancestors in @entity31 for thousands of years , but belonged to a different human sub-species			0
they eventually became extinct around 30,000 years ago			1
around 8 % of human dna is made up of endogenous retroviruses , or @entity36 , which are dna sequences left by viruses which pass from generation to generation			1
they form part of the 90per cent of the genome , sometimes called ' junk ' dna , that contains no instruction codes for making proteins			2
the analysis included ' snippets ' of the mystery dna - neither human nor @entity5 dr @entity51 , from @entity53 ’s @entity52 , who co-led the research , said : ' i would n’t write it off as ‘ junk ’ just because we do n’t know what it does yet			1
' under certain circumstances , two ‘ junk ’ viruses can combine to cause disease			0
we ’ve seen this many times in animals already			0
ervs have been shown to cause cancer when activated by bacteria in mice with weakened immune systems			0
' the @entity53 team now plans to look for possible links between these ancient viruses , belonging to the @entity76 virus family , and cancer and @entity78			1
' how @entity78 patients respond to @entity76 is related to how fast a patient will progress to @entity78 , so there is clearly a connection there , ' said dr @entity51			0
' @entity78 patients are also at much higher risk of developing cancer , for reasons that are poorly - understood			2
it is possible that some of the risk factors are genetic , and may be shared with @entity76			0
' they also become reactivated in cancer and hiv infection , so might prove useful as a therapy target in the future			0
' co-author dr @entity95 , from the @entity96 , said : ' using modern dna sequencing of 300 patients , we should be able to see how widespread these viruses are in the modern population			1
' we would expect viruses with no negative effects to have spread throughout most of the modern population , as there would be no evolutionary pressure against it			2
' if we find that these viruses are less common than expected , this may indicate that the viruses have been inactivated by chance or that they increase mortality , for example through increased cancer risk			2
' the study , published in the journal @entity117 , was funded by the @entity118 and @entity119			0
our modern language can be traced back to @entity5 living half a million years ago , scientists have claimed			1
research increasingly seems to indicate that our close cousins , the @entity5 , were much more similar to us than imagined			2
@entity125 researchers argue that the last common ancestor we shared with the @entity5 around half a million years ago , shared speech and language with modern humans			1
they believe that the origins of out modern language are ten times older than previously thought			0
the scientists at the @entity134 in the @entity125 are interested in the implications for understanding present day linguistic diversity			0
popular opinion is that they spoke in primitive grunts , but neanderthal man successfully inhabited vast swathes of western @entity141 for several hundreds of thousands of years , during harsh ages and milder interglacial periods			0
@entity145 researchers @entity147 @entity146 , said that far from being slow brutes , their cognitive capacities and culture were comparable to ours			0
the duo , who have looked at past findings in detail , argue that essentially modern language and speech are an ancient feature of our lineage dating back at least to the most recent ancestor we shared with the @entity5 and the @entity17 ( another form of humanity known mostly from their genome )			1
their interpretation of scarce evidence contradicts a popular scenario believed by most language scientists , who think our modern language began with a sudden emergence of modernity presumably due to one or a few genetic mutations that gave rise to language .			2

scientists investigated links between ' endogenous retroviruses ' , which are hard - wired into dna , and modern diseases such as aids and cancer
researchers compared dna from @entity5 and another group of ancient humans called @entity17 with that obtained from cancer patients
found evidence of @entity5 and @entity17 viruses in modern dna , suggesting they shared a common ancestor more than *500,000* years ago
