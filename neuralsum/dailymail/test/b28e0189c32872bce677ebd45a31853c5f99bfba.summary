a new county cricket season is almost upon us with the first round of @entity4 fixtures this summer beginning on sunday up and down the country			1
@entity6 will be looking to defend their @entity8 title while @entity9 will hope his runs help @entity11 to promotion from the second tier			1
here is former @entity11 and @entity17 batsman @entity16 's guide to the @entity4			1
@entity8 @entity18 verdict : i do n’t think they have the strength to carry the title off			1
the best they can hope for is to consolidate their status as a regular @entity8 side			1
but they always have a flotilla of pace bowlers to look out for			1
key man : @entity31 – a highly promising quick , as @entity17 have realised			2
overseas : @entity33 ( @entity34 ) @entity18 's side pose for their team photo ahead of the 2015 county cricket season @entity38 verdict : it ’s always difficult for any team that ’s just been promoted : @entity41 go up and down every year			1
but if @entity43 paceman @entity42 , signed as a @entity44 , can stay fit they have a chance			2
and @entity47 will have a point to prove as well			2
key man : it would be fantastic if @entity51 can make the most of his undoubted talent			2
overseas : @entity54 ( @entity34 ) , @entity55 ( @entity56 , limited - overs ) @entity38 players join in with a selfie with their sponsors at their @entity62 home in @entity63 @entity64 verdict : i tipped them for the title last season , but they barely ended up escaping relegation			1
the loss of @entity72 to @entity75 ’s @entity74 squad is a big blow , and they ’ll need to replace the runs of his fellow @entity74 tourist @entity79 at the top of the order			2
key man : the return of a revitalised @entity84 from @entity85 is huge			2
overseas : @entity86 @entity84 has joined @entity64 from @entity85 with a point to prove to @entity17 selectors @entity89 verdict : they promised much in 2014 , but delivered little			2
@entity6 overhauled them easily in the end			2
but i expect them to be strong , especially in seam bowling : @entity96 ’s a big signing , and they ’ll have the experienced @entity99 too			2
key man : this is @entity102 ’s chance to prove he can be more than just a one - day hitter			2
overseas : @entity96 ( @entity104 ) , @entity99 ( @entity34 ) , @entity105 ( @entity43 , @entity106 ) big things will be expected of @entity89 in the 2015 season given their strength and depth @entity85 verdict : with the likes of @entity113 , they have a wealth of experience at @entity116 now , which they ’ll need – they ’ve often struggled to get over the line because of a lack of cricketing nous			1
but they ’re brimming with talent , and the @entity125 twins – @entity126 and @entity127 – will be worth watching			2
key man : the new coach @entity129 – his edge is just what they need			2
overseas : @entity133 ( @entity56 ) , @entity134 ( @entity56 , @entity106 ) , @entity135 ( @entity136 , @entity106 )			2
@entity85 's new director of cricket @entity129 will be hoping to leave his mark at @entity116 @entity140 verdict : my tip for the title			1
@entity144 is back from another successful @entity145 with @entity146 , and they ’ll have @entity148 to steam in down the hill : lefties are all the rage right now			0
throw in @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 , and there ’s a heap of talent			0
key man : @entity154 ’s accurate seam bowling is one of the game ’s most unsung phenomena			0
overseas : @entity154 ( @entity34 ) , @entity155 ( @entity164 , @entity106 ) @entity165 ( left ) and @entity144 ( right ) at @entity140 's media day ahead of the new season at @entity168 @entity169 verdict : they had a cracking summer last year , and they have a nice blend of experienced players and others approaching their peak , in the 27 - 31 category			1
they ’ll need to keep the squad fit so they can rotate – and it ’ll be interesting to see how much of @entity182 they ’ll get , because he ’ll have an eye on the @entity74			0
key man : @entity185 – 59 championship wickets last year with his off - breaks			1
overseas : @entity185 ( @entity136 ) , @entity188 ( @entity136 , @entity106 ) @entity17 fast bowler @entity189 dressed in @entity169 's yellow limited - overs strip @entity41 verdict : it often confounds me how a team that looks so workmanlike on paper can keep appearing in @entity8 ahead of more fancied sides , but coach @entity197 gets them playing disciplined cricket , and @entity200 ’s a terrific leader			1
key man : if the pitches are dry in the second half of the season , @entity201 could keep them up by himself			1
overseas : @entity206 ( @entity164 ) , @entity201 ( @entity56 ) , @entity207 ( @entity136 , @entity106 ) @entity56 spinner @entity201 could prove to be a big weapon during the 2015 county season @entity6 verdict : their biggest challenge in defending their title will be how to cope with losing so many players to @entity17			1
but well done to them for fulfilling a major part of a county ’s brief , which is to produce @entity219 cricketers			0
and it ’s a predominantly @entity6 - born team too			0
key man : @entity221 – the captain will be ever - present while others are on @entity17 duty			0
overseas : @entity225 ( @entity226 ) , @entity227 ( @entity34 ) , @entity228 ( @entity136 ) , @entity229 ( @entity34 , @entity106 ) @entity6 captain @entity221 celebrates winning @entity8 at the end of the 2014 season @entity232 @entity233 verdict : @entity234 will arrive fresh from his @entity145 heroics , and last season @entity236 was far and away the quickest bowler on the county circuit			1
they ’ll be a tough nut to crack			0
key man : @entity236 was the @entity241 ’ leading wicket - taker in 2014 with 82 at 19 each			0
overseas : @entity234 ( @entity136 ) , @entity243 ( @entity164 , @entity106 ) , @entity244 ( @entity34 , @entity106 ) @entity245 's @entity145 star @entity234 will play for @entity233 this summer @entity246 verdict : somehow , they always manage to mess up their promotion bid			0
@entity249 will give them a bit of x-factor , but they ’ve lost two talented young players in @entity148 and wicketkeeper @entity255			0
key man : @entity256 – potentially destructive with both bat and ball			0
overseas : @entity249 ( @entity136 ) , @entity259 ( @entity34 , @entity106 ) @entity246 star @entity260 holds an eagle during the team 's media day at @entity264 @entity265 verdict : they ’ve been finding life very difficult of late , and they ’ve had a bit of an overhaul during the winter			0
having @entity272 available for the whole season is a boost , and @entity276 batsman @entity275 has arrived as a @entity44			1
key man : @entity277 is a feisty all - rounder			0
overseas : @entity272 ( @entity104 ) @entity265 have endured a tough time of late and will be hoping for better fortunes in 2015 @entity280 verdict : the loss of the @entity283 brothers – @entity284 – leaves a big hole in the side , both on and off the field			1
it ’s interesting that @entity289 will captain them in four - day cricket , but it ’s hard to see them improving on their seventh - place finish from last year			1
key player : will @entity297 's runs could be crucial			0
overseas : @entity298 ( @entity34 ) , @entity299 ( @entity34 ) former @entity301 and @entity17 wicketkeeper @entity289 will captain @entity280 in four - day cricket @entity301 verdict : as ever , their problem will be how to take 20 wickets , but at least seamer @entity306 is back from @entity38			0
the batting looks stronger , with @entity308 rejoining from @entity64 , and young talent in @entity310 and @entity311			0
key player : @entity313 – an @entity17 star in the making			0
overseas : @entity86 @entity301 star @entity313 in training with the @entity317 in @entity318 in january @entity319 verdict : they had a massively disappointing 2014 , going straight back down after winning @entity232			1
but , along with @entity11 , they ’ll fancy their chances of promotion			1
and their new coach , @entity324 , will be keen as mustard after being discarded by @entity17			0
key player : @entity328 – showed his all - round class last summer			0
overseas : @entity330 ( @entity34 ) @entity319 endured a disappointing 2014 campaign which ended in relegation back to @entity232 @entity333 verdict : they were rock bottom last year , and without a @entity4 win in two seasons , but there ’s a feeling of renewal at @entity341 : a new chief executive in @entity343 , and three @entity344 in @entity345 ( coach ) , @entity347 ( captain ) and @entity349 ( seamer )			1
key player : @entity347 can give @entity333 some rollicking starts			0
overseas : @entity349 ( @entity34 ) former @entity75 all - rounder @entity345 ( right ) will coach @entity333 this summer @entity352 verdict : they ’ll be wiser for the experience after a dismal 2014 , when a pre-season injury to captain @entity356 proved a disaster			0
time to prove that they can rediscover the form that made them such a hit in 2013			0
key player : local lad @entity363 bowls brisk left - arm and gives it a whack			0
overseas : @entity367 ( @entity104 ) , @entity368 ( @entity56 , @entity106 ) @entity369 all - rounder @entity368 will play @entity106 cricket for @entity352 this summer @entity11 verdict : the @entity9 circus is coming to town			1
there ’ll be plenty of attention on the club , and therefore also on the talented younger players – the likes of @entity379 , @entity380 , @entity381 and @entity382			1
they ’ve simply got to get out of @entity232			1
key player : @entity379 – a big chance to nudge the @entity17 selectors			0
