the passage of 70 years may have taken its toll in other ways			1
but it has done nothing to dull their memories or dim their pride , as this remarkably powerful collection of photographs makes clear			1
gathered for the @entity11 , these are the men and women of d - day , then and now			1
the stakes were never higher than on the morning of june 6 , 1944 , when an @entity16 force of 156,000 stormed the @entity13 beaches			1
@entity18 , 90 , was serving with 86th @entity19 , @entity20 and landed at @entity21			1
the memories are still hauntingly vivid			1
' i still ca n't forget all the dead bodies that were floating around us when we landed , ' he says			1
' one or two of the lads were sick when they saw that			1
' @entity30 , 90 , was with the 2nd @entity31 , which landed on @entity21			1
he ca n't forget all the boats that were sunk			1
around 90 landing craft were lost out of 306 vessels on @entity35 alone			1
' there must have been hundreds of men who died and i was thinking , you poor devils , ' he recalls			1
@entity42 , 92 , of the @entity43 , was one of the first nurses to arrive after @entity13 and took care of up to 200 injured soldiers a day at her field hospital , both @entity49 troops and @entity51 pows			1
' they needed rehydration , rest and morphine , and we were using a new medicine - penicillin , ' she says			1
even now , @entity58 still can not bring himself to say what ’s in his mind when the @entity61 sounds			1
some things are between him and the chaps who never came home			1
he would have been among them had an act of kindness to a wounded @entity51 not saved him from summary execution			2
this week , these veterans will return to @entity13 , as many do every year			1
this time , though , they will be accompanied by royalty , heads of state , tens of thousands of well - wishers and battalions of international media for the 70th anniversary of @entity13			1
@entity79 , 90 , of @entity80 , the @entity81 , was in one of the gliders but the tow rope snapped before they got to @entity85 , forcing the glider to land			2
' i could n't believe we had landed in @entity89 , ' he remembers			2
he flew again that day and was wounded later in @entity13 by a @entity51 machine gun			1
@entity91 , 94 , a captain medical officer in the 225th @entity92 , @entity93 , treated hundreds of paras severely injured in the drop and was awarded the mc			2
' i was looking out of the @entity97 and saw the surf breaking on the coast , ' he recalls			2
' at that moment we were given the order to jump			2
' @entity102 , 88 , a private serving in @entity104 , the @entity105 , landed on @entity106			2
three months later , in intensive fighting in @entity13 , he was wounded by a mortar , losing his eye			1
' the carnage on the beach brought me to a complete standstill , ' he remembers			2
' it was so horrific it has stuck with me to this day			2
' stretched across a 50 - mile front , it was a vast battlefield			2
yet two of those pictured here will be going back to the same spot			2
their story exemplifies the courage and sacrifice of countless @entity16 troops			2
@entity58 and @entity79 were among 750 men of the @entity81 ’s @entity80 — 9 @entity127 — whose task was to land at night by parachute and glider and seize the enemy gun battery at @entity132 , which threatened carnage when thousands of @entity49 troops landed on @entity135 at dawn			0
their plan went awry from the start , as much of 9 @entity81 came down in the wrong place			0
many drowned in flooded fields , and commanding officer lt - col @entity142 reached the battery with just 150 men			0
@entity145 , 88 , was a @entity146 able seaman on board the @entity148 @entity149			0
his defining memory of that momentous day ? ' coming on deck for watch early that morning and seeing all those ships			0
i 'd never seen so many ships in all my life			0
that 's when i knew something was going to happen			0
' @entity58 , 88 , was a member of @entity127 , and assigned to crash - land in a glider on the @entity132 gun battery and take it out			0
he was wounded , captured , narrowly escaped execution , and later escaped from a @entity165 hospital , ' when we crashed , we immediately ran into a @entity51 patrol , ' he remembers , ' and we sprung into action			0
' @entity169 , 92 , an air commodore flying @entity171 with the @entity173 's @entity172 , dropped members of the @entity175			0
taking off at one in the morning , he flew straight to the drop zone			0
it was hairy stuff , he recalls			0
' the @entity146 were to our right and i was terrified they would mistakenly shoot us down			0
' @entity183 ' @entity182 , 94 , was a captain in the @entity184 , commanding ferries on @entity106			0
he remembers how quickly the wounded were being attended to and returned to @entity89 by landing craft			0
' it was hugely reassuring that if we did get injured we could be back in @entity89 that afternoon , ' he says			0
one of the three gliders had aborted over @entity89 while the other two were shot up on the way in			0
@entity58 , in one of them , was shot through the legs			0
he crawled out of the wreckage and straight into a @entity51 patrol that he helped to fight off while the main force heroically overran the battery			0
now down to 75 men , 9 @entity127 moved @entity198 was left with two wounded @entity51 and gave one his morphine			0
when an enemy patrol arrived he was beaten up and heard a machine pistol being cocked			0
but then one of the wounded @entity51 explained how @entity58 had helped him , and he was spared			0
is it any wonder @entity58 , and all these veterans , remember d - day as if it were yesterday ? this week , let us all remember it too			1
* @entity58 will be speaking at @entity210 ’s @entity209 , from june 23 to 29			0
other @entity13 events include actor @entity212 and @entity13 re-enactments — @entity214			1

now , they remember those *historic* events as if they were yesterday
