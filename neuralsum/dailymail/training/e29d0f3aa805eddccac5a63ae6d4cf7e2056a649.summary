@entity0 says the days of giving sympathy penalties to @entity2 are long gone – and believes the striker is back to his free - scoring best			1
the @entity5 frontman has a habit of hitting hot streaks in front of goal , evidenced by his four from three this season and 13 in 12 following his arrival on @entity12 in january 2012			1
but @entity2 has also endured some barren spells and skied a penalty given to him by his team - mates during one such dry run two seasons ago			1
@entity5 manager @entity0 believes @entity2 is back to his best form - the striker has four goals in three appearances this season @entity0 's side continue their hunt for a first @entity25 win as they host @entity26 on saturday @entity2 skies a penalty in @entity5 's match with @entity29 at @entity30 in september 2012 @entity0 , though , is confident that the 29 - year - old is ready to resume his goals trail when @entity5 – still in the bottom three and without a win this term – entertain @entity26 this afternoon			1
‘ he is a natural goalscorer , we see that on the training ground , ’ said the @entity37 boss			1
‘ there have been times when it has n't been so natural for him			2
with all goalscorers they go through those periods , but certainly at the moment he has looked very sharp in training			0
‘ when goalscorers get their tails up , they have an unbelievable knack of finding a goal			0
‘ the first goal at @entity54 ( 2 - 2 draw earlier this month ) , i do n’t think there is anyone else on our staff who could have scored that goal , and that is what i mean by finding a technique that gets you a goal			0
@entity0 congratulates @entity2 after taking him off in the 2 - 2 draw at @entity54 earlier this month @entity2 scores @entity5 's second goal in the draw at the @entity66 on october 4 ‘ he does that on the training ground on a more regular basis when he is in form , like now , than he did in that period ( when team - mates gave him the penalty )			1
’ @entity2 – who scored both goals to rescue a point at @entity54 - has been away on international duty with @entity76 for the past fortnight and only returned to training yesterday			2
@entity0 , though , has no hesitation about starting him against @entity80 ’s side			2
‘ i do n't think it 's a risk to play him , ’ he said			0
‘ i think he is injury - free for the first time in a long time , because at the back end of last year he was carrying knocks and fatigue a little bit			2
‘ he is more enthused this year than i have seen him for a long time , and that 's being reflected in his goals			0
’ @entity0 issues instructions during a training session this week as @entity5 prepare for the @entity26 match @entity0 , meanwhile , admits his players need the home fans on side as they bid to avoid becoming the first @entity5 team to go eight matches without a win from the start of a @entity25 campaign			1
‘ it is such an important game for us and for everybody at this football club , ’ he added			0
‘ i hope it is an atmosphere that gives the players the chance to win this game			0
i ca n’t tell you how committed we are to try and get the win for them			0
