it 's a hard life , but someone 's got to do it ... a group of elephants relax and enjoy a day of pampering at a spa in @entity7 where workers scrub and massage them all day long			1
july is a month of rejuvenation in @entity7 and it 's not just humans who appreciate the chance to kick back and enjoy a spot of luxury , if this adorable video is anything to go by			2
the elephants are hosed down , scrubbed clean , massaged and fed nutritious snacks by a horde of workers , watched by an interested crowd			2
reclining lazily in the nearby river , they clearly love every minute of their ' treatments ' , lolling about while workers attend to their ritual pampering session			0
and as if that were n't enough , tasty - for an elephant anyway - and nutritious snacks are then fed to the elephants to aid in their ' rejuvenation '			0
the spa days take place in @entity48 every july and are a way for the workers to reward their loyal tuskers for taking part in the processions which are a part of daily life			0
what , i can just lie here all day ? the elephant spa can accommodate up to 59 elephants at a time and after the bathing , the snacks begin : elephant pamperers offer tasty nutritious foods to aid rejuvenation ear ear : the elephants are led out into the hosing down area for a nice post-massage shower			1
