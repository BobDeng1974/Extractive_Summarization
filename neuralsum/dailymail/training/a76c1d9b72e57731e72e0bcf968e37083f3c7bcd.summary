by @entity0 @entity1 insisted @entity2 had always been his first choice after finally completing his controversial on - off move from @entity5			1
the 24 - year - old @entity6 international looked to have turned his back on the @entity10 champions in favour of a move to @entity13 despite passing a @entity2 medical in @entity15 and agreeing terms on a move to @entity18			1
but after the @entity24 club had made their disgust known at @entity1 ’s change of heart , suddenly the £ 2.2million deal was back on again amid claims that @entity27 financial play rules had sunk the move to @entity13			1
remember the name : @entity1 signed for @entity2 from @entity5 amid @entity13 interest as he was unveiled on tuesday night on a four - year deal , @entity1 vowed to work hard to win over the fans			1
but he flatly denied messing @entity2 about and even challenged his detractors to prove anything other than @entity35 ’s side were always his preferred option			2
‘ my first choice was always @entity2 , ’ insisted the striker			1
‘ i never said i did n’t want to come here			2
i do n’t know why people say things like that			2
when i spoke with my family and friends , i always said my choice was to come here			2
yes , there were some problems in the deal but the most important thing is that i am here now			0
‘ i know ( some fans might be wary )			0
but they can search the internet and they will never find any quotes from me where i said i did n’t want to come to @entity2			1
never — because i did n’t say it			0
‘ i know @entity2 is a big club with a lot of history and great fans			2
i want to prove i can play at a big club like @entity2			1
‘ i ’ll work hard and do everything to prove i can play here and bring something different			0
ball skills : the striker shows off his keepie - uppies at @entity24 controversial : it looked as if he favoured a move to @entity13 , before @entity69 regulations , he then landed in @entity18 ‘ monday was a tough day , but that ’s football , ’ he added			1
‘ i was in my house watching tv and i was really a little bit nervous because of the situation			0
but at the same time i was calm			0
i had a choice before i chose @entity2 and i was happy when i knew i would be a @entity2 player			1
‘ what made me nervous ? it ’s normal			0
i was nervous because maybe there were some problems			0
but i do n’t want to look at what happened before			0
i just look to the future			0

@entity1 looked like he was moving to @entity13 on a busy monday
@entity27 financial fair play rules sunk the move to @entity87 *rivals*
says : my first choice was @entity2 . i never said i did n’t want to come here '
