@entity0 has won @entity3 federal regulators ' approval to test its drone delivery service			1
the e-commerce giant hopes to speed packages to customers through the air - despite public concern over the safety and privacy implications			2
the @entity12 said on thursday it had issued an experimental airworthiness certificate to an @entity0 unit and its prototype drone design , allowing it to conduct outdoor test flights on private , rural land in @entity18			1
the aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5 pounds			0
about 86 percent of @entity0 's deliveries are 5 pounds or less , the company said			1
' we believe customers will love it , and we are committed to making @entity27 available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so , ' @entity0 has said			2
the experimental certificate applies to a particular drone design and @entity0 must obtain a new certification for test flights if it modifies the drone			2
in return , the company must supply monthly data to the regulators , and conduct flights at 400 feet ( 120 metres ) or below and in ' visual meteorological conditions , ' according to the @entity12 's certificate			0
the drone operators must also have a private pilots ' license and current medical certification			0
@entity0 chief executive @entity50 wants to use drones - small unmanned aircraft - to deliver packages as part of a program dubbed ' @entity27			1
' the company is developing drones that can fly at speeds of 50 miles per hour ( 80 kph ) , operate autonomously and sense and avoid objects			0
@entity0 sought permission from the @entity12 to test drones in outdoor areas near @entity62 , where one of its research and development labs is working on the technology			1
the company has conducted test flights outside the @entity3 , in countries with looser restrictions			0
in february , the @entity12 proposed long - awaited rules to try to set universal guidelines for drones , addressing growing interest from both individual and corporations in using unmanned aerial vehicles			2
the draft rules , nearly 10 years in the making , still must undergo public comment and revision before becoming final , a process expected to take at least a year			0
@entity0 did not immediately respond to requests for comment			0
it has previously threatened to take its testing outside the @entity3			0
' in the absence of a timely approval by the @entity12 to conduct outdoor testing , we have begun utilizing outdoor testing facilities outside the @entity3 , ' @entity0 vice president @entity85 said in a letter to the @entity12			1
' these non-us facilities enable us to quickly build and modify our prime air vehicles as we construct new designs and make improvements , ' he said .			1

@entity12 gave go - ahead for trials on private rural land in @entity18
@entity0 hope prime air service could make deliveries in under *30* minutes
