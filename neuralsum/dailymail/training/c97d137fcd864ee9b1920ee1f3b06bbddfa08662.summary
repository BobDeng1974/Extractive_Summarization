the @entity51 , originally from the @entity52 , the ‘ toe ’ of @entity1 , have spread their tentacles into the north of @entity1 and into neighbouring countries forming links with the @entity58 cartels and the @entity59 among others			2
they supply an estimated 80 per cent of @entity62 's cocaine			0
details of the recorded meeting were revealed on tuesday by @entity1 police who released part of the footage			2
in the quasi-religious ceremony , which also borrows from freemasonry traditions , those present organised their hierarchy and allotted roles to each other			0
sitting round a table with heads bowed , the group ‘ baptised ’ their surroundings			0
then the footage shows the boss asking them to agree ' a sacred bond '			0
for the first time officers witnessed the conferral of a role onto an underage minor , the 16 - year - old nephew of one of the other gang members ; during the ceremony members repeated ' a secret bond ' he is heard saying : ' this sacred evening and under the light and splendour of the stars and the moon we form a sacred bond			1
' the gangsters repeat after him : ' we pledge to deny everything until the seventh generation , to renounce all the criminal societies recognised by me until today , so as to preserve the honour of my wise brothers			0
' the bond is made in the names of @entity109 and @entity110 , heroes of the @entity1 unification who were said to be cited in freemasonry and are thought to refer to nicknames of the group			0
