two men told the world they were calm , but it was impossible to believe them			2
a press conference between @entity4 and @entity5 , the two contenders for the world title , fizzed with energy and a few niggling comments that betrayed the facades of quiet calmness			1
once the traditional handshakes had been done , the question of whether they would race cleanly was brought up			0
just 17 points separate the pair going into the last race in @entity18 on sunday and the scope for skulduggery is clear			1
@entity4 - 334 points 2			1
@entity5 - 317 points @entity4 will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season - ending @entity35 , even if @entity5 wins the race			1
if the final race was a ‘ normal ’ race with 25 points for the winner , rather than the double points on offer , @entity4 would be able to claim his second drivers ’ title with a sixth - place finish			1
@entity4 said the two of them would not talk about how they behave on track			1
‘ no , ’ he said			0
‘ we do n’t need to			0
it ’s been discussed at the beginning of the season and several times through the season and particularly after @entity54 again			2
we should know what is wrong and what is right			0
’ @entity5 , a company man down to his neat fingernails , was less restrained , saying : ‘ @entity4 can do something to keep it clean , which is to drive clean himself , so it ’s not like he ca n’t do anything			1
he added : ‘ of course i need to do what i can to put pressure on @entity4			2
he made a mistake in @entity65 , so there ’s a chance			0
i ’ll do what i can			0
’ @entity4 and @entity5 will go head - to - head for this season 's championship at the final round the @entity74 is bidding to emulate his father @entity76 who won the drivers ' championship in 1982 @entity4 has won 10 races this year while his @entity26 team - mate @entity5 has racked up five victories are they nervous ? @entity4 said : ‘ i really do n’t feel any more pressure			1
‘ in my racing career of 20 years to be prepared for today			0
there is no special recipe for it			0
’ @entity5 was a little more honest , saying : ‘ it ’s an intense situation			2
but it is the situation i have been looking forward to all my life			0
’ we could glean more from their body language			0
@entity4 was tight – or focused			2
he barely raised a smile though the half an hour of the official press conference			0
these are big moments in their lives and it showed			0
but , of course , their body language may count for nothing when their lights go out on sunday , when @entity4 only needs to finish first or second to be assured of the title			1
@entity106 previews @entity108 season finale @entity4 and @entity5 collided at the @entity109 @entity35			1
@entity4 retired while @entity5 finished second			1

@entity4 and title rival @entity5 face media ahead of season finale

@entity4 said he and @entity5 would not discuss how to behave on track
@entity5 , 17 points *adrift* of team - mate @entity4 , was less restrained , saying : ' @entity4 can do something which is to drive clean himself '
