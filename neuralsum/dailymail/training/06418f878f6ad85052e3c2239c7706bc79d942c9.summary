tell all : @entity1 has written a book about her life as a professional ballroom dancer on the popular @entity7 series @entity5 , the professional dancers and their celebrity partners are often seen to become the best of friends , supporting one another throughout the competition			1
the reality of competing on the ballroom dance circuit is somewhat different , according to three times world champion , @entity1 , who is lifting the lift on the sequin - filled world in a new book			1
she told @entity21 : ' it 's a competition , not a performance			2
so the normal tension and rivalries are heightened			0
it is rare to develop a true friendship with your competitors , like you would see in a dance company			2
' @entity31 is an interesting dichotomy			0
beneath the seemingly calm and composed exterior is a cauldron bubbling with nerves , anxious tension and pent up energy			0
most of the dancers pace until their event is called and remind me of the energy of thoroughbred horses at the starting gate			0
' @entity45 - born @entity1 , who trained at the @entity46 , said despite the fierce rivalry , attempts to sabotage the performance of a fellow competitor are thankfully rare			1
' i have never heard of anything so terrible and tragic as the acid incident at the @entity52 , ' she said , referring to the time in 2013 when tensions at @entity55 's rival ballet companies turned violent and dancer @entity56 threw acid on the face of artistic director , @entity59			1
@entity1 said a dancers ' worst enemy can often be the judge , rather than their competitor , as ' politics ' means the best performer does n't necessarily win			1
' many talented ballroom dancers leave the competition circuit when they tire of the politics			0
my book speaks about the politics in ballroom dance , which has been a taboo subject			2
anytime you have a decision based on human opinion there will be controversy , ' she said			0
' the winner of a ballroom competition is not defined by who crosses the finish line first			0
what opens the door for " politics " to exist in ballroom dance competitions is the fact that our current system allows the coaches to also judge			1
it would be akin to allowing a barrister to also preside as judge of a legal case			0
' @entity93 : @entity1 , performing one of her routines , has won national and international titles politics aside , @entity1 said she loves every aspect of the dance world - but success has not been easy			1
she 's worked hard to become a @entity103 and @entity104 champion , making sacrifices along the way			1
' to become a top ranked professional ballroom dancer , you must live , breath , eat dance 24/7 , ' she explained			1
' nothing else can matter more , not relationships , family or comforts			1
your passion must be all consuming and borderline obsessive to make it through the eye of the needle			2
' @entity121 , one of my early mentors , and director of the @entity127 ballet said it best , " i do n't want dancers who want to dance , i want dancers that need to dance			0
" ' but @entity1 said the sacrifices are worth it to reap the rewards of being a professional ballroom dancer			1
' the lifestyle of a top ranked ballroom dancer is a page out of the " @entity139 " , ' she said			0
' if you " make it " and become the champion , you travel all over the world to compete , perform and teach			0
it 's a very glamorous way to see the world and get paid to do what you love most - dance ! glamorous : the dancer , pictured in her youth , said she never gets tired of the sequins or elaborate make - up ' i have had the pleasure to perform in @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity55 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and in @entity161 movies			1
' of course , the make - up and outfits all add to the glamour and @entity1 said as a professional dancer , you can never have too much sparkle , tassles or fake tan			1
' there 's a saying that " you can never be too rich or too thin " - in the ballroom dance world , you can never be too tan ! ' she joked			2
she added : ' hair color is usually extreme - platinum blonde , flaming red or jet black			0
make - up is exaggerated ; eyelashes , eyebrows and lips are all accentuated			0
in a sea of competitors it 's important to stand out and be the most exotic or colourful fish			0
' as for the costumes , they are always ' exquisite '			0
political : @entity1 said being the best dancer does n't always guarantee victory ' the amount of time and attention to detail that goes into designing these lavish creations is similar to the fashion world 's obsession with every facet of a piece of clothing , ' she said			1
as well as looking lavish , the costumes must allow the performers to have freedom to move			0
@entity1 says she never gets fed up of the sparkly costumes or make - up that are necessary for a ballroom or @entity206 dance routine			1
' it 's part of the fun and fantasy - to become larger than life , to be sexier or more provocative or more elegant than you can be in normal daily life , ' she said			2
ballroom ! obsession and @entity214 of @entity215 by @entity1 is out now , published by the @entity216 of @entity217			2

@entity1 has won national and international dance titles
she said being a professional dancer is a glamorous life
but it 's also hard work and many sacrifices must be made to ' make it '
' nothing else can matter more , not relationships or family , ' she said
rivalry is fierce at competitions where tensions run high
