researchers saw that the more time people spend commuting to and from work the less likely they are to be satisfied with life being crammed in a train carriage with other grumpy and sweaty workers or sitting in endless traffic jams to get to work is no one ’s idea of fun			1
now researchers saw that the more time people spend commuting to and from work the less likely they are to be satisfied with life			1
long journey times were also unsurprisingly linked to an increased sense of time pressure , with less time spent on hobbies , including exercise			1
@entity21 , a professor in @entity22 at the @entity23 in @entity24 , said : ‘ we found that the longer it takes someone to get to work , the lower their satisfaction with life in general ’			1
professor @entity21 , who is also associate director of research for the @entity33 says that bad traffic and delays are not always to blame			0
the study , published in @entity37 , analysed data from @entity39 to understand the links between commute time and well - being			2
the researchers found that on top of being linked to lower life satisfaction , long commute lengths are related to an increased sense of time pressure			1
‘ some people may enjoy a commute , but overall , longer travel time is linked to feelings of time crunch , which can increase stress levels , ’ professor @entity21 said			1
lengthy commutes have already been linked to poor mental and physical health , including hypertension , obesity , low - energy and illness - related work absences			0
beyond bad traffic , the researchers found one other factor to be highly correlated with commuters ’ life satisfaction - physical activity			2
lengthy commutes ( illustrated ) have already been linked to poor mental and physical health , including hypertension , obesity , low - energy and illness - related work absences an office filled with pot plants can boost workers ' happiness and productivity by 15 per cent , according to a study released in september			1
researchers studied the effects of greenery on staff 's perceptions of air quality , concentration , and workplace satisfaction , and monitored productivity levels over subsequent months in two large commercial offices in the @entity84 and @entity85			0
lead researcher @entity86 , from the @entity87 , said : ' our research suggests that investing in landscaping the office with plants will pay off through an increase in office workers quality of life and productivity			0

‘ physical activity can mitigate commuting - related stress if workers can include it in their daily routines , but the obvious constraint is time scarcity			2
longer commutes mean less time for other activities , which leads to lower life satisfaction			0
’ other factors linked to higher life satisfaction among commuters include flexible work hours and a higher household income			2
according to the study , women reported higher levels of time pressure , as did those with a partner			1

‘ the message to employers is that encouraging flexible work hours or providing time for physical leisure can pay dividends in their employees ’ satisfaction with life , ’ she said			2
