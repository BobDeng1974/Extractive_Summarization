by @entity0 and @entity1 sir @entity2 was denied a golden return to track cycling as he and @entity6 's pursuit team were beaten by a rampant @entity7 in the @entity8			1
@entity9 , 34 , joined @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 in claiming silver in the 4,000m discipline at the sir @entity15 , but there was never any chance of edging out an @entity7 quartet who built an immediate advantage and never looked like letting it go			1
‘ i ’m disappointed we came second here but in hindsight we ’ll look back and think this is a start point for us now , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity26 is the goal and we ’ve got to work back from that			0
’ the team 's valiant efforts were watched by @entity31 and @entity32 , @entity33			0
the @entity31 roared on the team and covered her face when they failed to overcome the might of the @entity7 men 's team			2
with a disappointing year at @entity65 behind him , having been dumped from the @entity67 - which he won in 2012 , the first @entity69 to do - line - up , he made a late decision to compete here			0
instead @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 finished with their @entity6 team in their sights and a winning margin in excess of five seconds - a crushing victory			1
for @entity9 it represents a fourth @entity8 silver medal after a six - year hiatus from the track , though there were signs that there is plenty more to come from both him and his team - mates on the road to @entity94			0
@entity7 had finished almost two seconds ahead of @entity6 in qualifying , though the latter assured themselves of at least second place by besting a talented @entity99 outfit , who cruised to bronze by chasing down @entity102			2
a packed @entity104 audience showed no nationalistic bias as they roared @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 on but it was to no avail			1
glum : @entity31 , @entity31 and @entity32 , @entity33 watch the @entity110 compete in the @entity111 at the @entity15			0
she seemed disappointed with the silver obtained by sir @entity2 et al the agony and the ecstasy : the @entity31 covers her eyes as the @entity7 's triumph dejected : @entity9 looks glum after losing out on gold to @entity7 in the men 's team pursuit final out in front : @entity9 leads the way but @entity6 could n't cope with @entity7 's speed in the final too good : @entity7 's @entity125 celebrates after helping his country win gold at the sir @entity15 all smiles : @entity7 duo @entity74 and @entity76 raise their arms in celebration at the end of the race they slipped a second behind almost immediately as @entity7 attacked hard in the first couple of laps and the advantage was touching two seconds at the 1,500m mark			1
@entity6 sensed hope when @entity76 dropped out of the race soon after halfway , but instead @entity7 merely increased their stranglehold , adding to their lead at each split			2
@entity10 rode himself to a standstill before pulling up late on , leaving @entity9 , @entity11 and @entity12 to complete what had become a surprisingly one - sided outing .			1

@entity7 *emerged* victorious with a winning margin in excess of five seconds at the sir @entity15
@entity9 was unable to help @entity6 mount a comeback after a slow start
@entity76 was forced to drop out during the race
@entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 rode *alongside* @entity9
