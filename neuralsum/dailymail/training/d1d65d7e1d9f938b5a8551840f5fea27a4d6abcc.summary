capitulation : @entity1 called the decision a ' disappointing moment ' , it sets aside a difficult and divisive issue through the 2014 congressional elections in november and clears the way for @entity7 to focus their campaign efforts on the rocky launch of @entity11 's health care reform law the @entity7 - controlled @entity12 has backed away from a battle over the government 's debt cap and passed a measure extending @entity18 's borrowing authority with overwhelming support from president @entity11 's @entity21 allies			1
the 221 - 201 vote came hours after speaker @entity1 announced that his fractured party would relent and not seek to add other items to the must - pass legislation			2
twenty - eight @entity7 voted yes			2
the bill would permit @entity18 to borrow normally for another 13 months and would diffuse the chance of a debt crisis well past the november elections			0
just monday , @entity7 suggested pairing the debt measure with legislation to roll back a recent cut in the inflation adjustment of pension benefits for working age military retirees			2
unwilling to risk spooking the markets , and leading a fractured @entity7 majority , house speaker @entity1 on tuesday stepped back from a confrontation with @entity21 to let @entity41 vote on increasing the government 's borrowing cap without trying to extract any concessions from the @entity12			1
the move risks more displeasure from the tea party but came after most @entity7 in the @entity12 made clear they had no taste for another high - stakes fight with president @entity11 over the nation 's debt ceiling , which must be raised so the government can borrow money to pay all of its bills			1
victory : president @entity11 spent today with @entity58 president @entity57 but he secured an important political victory over @entity7 today as they backed away without a fight on the debt ceiling walking away without a fight : caving into president @entity11 's demands for a " clean " debt ceiling increase , republicans in the @entity65 agreed on tuesday to advance legislation that extends @entity70 borrowing authority for a year with no strings attached the vote comes four months after @entity73 diffused a government shutdown and debt crisis that burned @entity7 politically - an experience they did not want to repeat			1
tuesday 's developments , which many @entity79 insiders saw coming , marks a major reversal of the @entity7 's strategy of trying to use the debt limit to force spending cuts or other concessions on @entity11			1
the president yielded to such demands in 2011 - before his re-election - but has since boxed in @entity7 by refusing to negotiate			2
@entity1 , made the announcement after conservatives failed to rally around his latest plan , floated monday , to tie lifting the debt ceiling to a measure to reverse cuts to military pensions that were enacted less than two months ago			1
earlier plans to tie a debt cap increase to approval of the @entity97 or repeal of part of the new health care law failed as well , stymied by a group of hard line conservatives who vowed never to vote for increasing the government 's debt , which stands at more than $ 17 trillion			1
president @entity11 hosts a state visit by @entity58 president @entity57 today - while over at the @entity79 @entity21 celebrated their decisive victory over the @entity7 the measure does not raise the debt limit by a set amount but would suspend it through march 15 of next year to allow @entity18 to borrow the money it needs to pay bills like @entity113 benefits , payments on government debt , and checks for federal workers			1
the move reflects a return to the old ways of handling the politically tricky debt ceiling vote in which the president 's party is expected to carry most of the load to pass it			1
' we 'll let the @entity21 put the votes up , ' the speaker said			0
' we 'll put a minimum number of ( @entity7 ) votes up to get it passed			0
' ' that 's how it 's supposed to work , ' said vice president @entity132 at the @entity79 after swearing in the newest senator , @entity133 , @entity135 - @entity134 @entity1 said his inability to assemble 218 @entity7 votes - enough to win a floor vote - for any debt limit plan left him no alternative but to turn to @entity21			1
winners : senator @entity142 , the @entity144 chairman , ( left ) , and senate majority leader @entity145 , arrive for a news conference on @entity79 in @entity73 on thursday last week , where they told reporters that @entity7 were preparing to battle attempts to raise the debt ceiling			1
in the end the @entity7 gave in and voted for the ceiling to be raised unfounded fears : ( from left ) , sen. @entity142 , @entity153 , the @entity144 chairman , senate majority leader @entity145 , @entity154 , senate majority whip @entity154 , @entity154 , sen. @entity154 , @entity154 , and sen. @entity155 , @entity156 , chair of the @entity157 , tell reporters last week that @entity7 are thwarting @entity21 efforts pass a bill to extend unemployment benefits ' when you do n't have 218 votes , you have nothing , ' @entity1 said			2
' we 've seen that before and we see it again			0
' he said @entity12 minority leader @entity169 , @entity135 , promised him sweeping @entity21 support in the vote			0
more than 180 @entity21 have signed a letter pledging to vote for a clean increase in the debt cap			0
the @entity12 applauded the move			0
@entity176 , director of the @entity12 's @entity177 , said the administration hopes tuesday 's development means ' that the tactic of threatening default or threatening the full faith and credit of the @entity70 for budget debates is over , off the table and never is going to happen again			0
and if so that would , i think , be a boost for confidence and investment in the @entity70			0
' @entity11 's refusal to negotiate , @entity7 disunity , and @entity1 's determination to avoid the possibility of a market - cratering default on @entity70 obligations gave the @entity198 @entity7 little choice but to announce the vote on a ' clean ' debt ceiling increase			1
' it 's disappointing but we have an intractable @entity12 , ' said rep. @entity203 , @entity204 ' this is a hard deal for us but it 's also important that we keep the country operating and the financial markets stable , so this is the thing we have to take until somehow there 's a change in attitude in the @entity157 or the @entity12 or a change of occupancy of the @entity157 or the @entity12			2
' come again : a @entity215 worker removes a closed sign at the @entity217 after it was re-opened to the public in @entity73 october 17 , 2013 new day : morning breaks over the @entity70 @entity79 as the federal government reopens after a 16 - day shutdown , in @entity73 , october 17 , 2013 the announcement amounted to resigned defeat for a party that has sought to use must - pass debt ceiling measures as leverage to force spending cuts on @entity21			1
republicans won more than $ 2 trillion in spending cuts in a 2011 showdown , but gave @entity11 two debt limit increases last year with only modest add - ons			2
' the @entity21 got burned when we negotiated and that led to the sequester , and we learned our lesson , ' said rep. @entity237 , @entity238			0
' and the @entity7 got burned when they shut the government down			0
' the @entity12 voted 326 - 90 tuesday on separate legislation to restore full cost - of - living increases that were to have been cut by 1 percent for retirees under 62			0
the cuts , which had just passed in december , were backed by @entity246 chairman @entity245 , @entity247 repealing them would cost $ 7 billion over the coming decade , the @entity243 said monday			0
the reduction sparked an uproar among advocates for veterans , and lawmakers in both parties are scrambling to repeal it .			0

republicans caved into president @entity11 's demands for a ' clean ' debt ceiling increase
the move marked a *dramatic* shift from the confrontational fiscal tactics
@entity12 @entity7 have used over the past three years , *culminating* in last october 's 16 - day government shutdown
@entity1 called the decision a ' disappointing moment ' for @entity7 - but has decided to focus his campaign efforts on the rocky launch of @entity11 's health care reform law
