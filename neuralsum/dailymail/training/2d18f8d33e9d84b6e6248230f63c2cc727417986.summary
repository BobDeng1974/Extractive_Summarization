by @entity0 many of us would find looking round our great - great - great - grandmother 's house a bit of a drag - if she was n't @entity7 @entity6			2
prince @entity8 has returned to a modest cottage which the monarch used to teach her nine children about ' normal ' life , including cooking , growing vegetables and selling the spoils at market prices ( albeit to @entity18 )			1
the @entity20 chalet at @entity21 , queen @entity22 's private home on the @entity23 , was where her children spent up to five months a year catching butterflies , having tea parties and operating a steam engine			1
family heirlooms : @entity8 and @entity29 of @entity30 have visited @entity21 , queen @entity6 's favourite getaway for herself and her nine children on the @entity23 and overlooking the @entity33			1
the sprawling estate hosts a new exhibition on life in a small chalet where the queen 's children learned about ' normal ' life normal life : the @entity7 would leave her nine children to their own devices in this @entity20 chalet , which has been the focus of a £ 1.7m conservation and history project by @entity47 and hosts a new exhibition on what life may have been like as a @entity50 child			1
pictured centre : the @entity52 and @entity53 ' looks normal to me ! ' many people would find looking around their great - great - great - grandmother 's cottage a boring task , but not so for @entity8 @entity59 : formally - dressed @entity60 gather round @entity7 @entity6 , centre , in a suitably dour tea party as @entity21			1
by this time she was wearing her customary black happy : queen @entity22 , left in 1890 , spent many happy months at @entity21 with @entity18			1
the photo right was taken at the @entity23 estate in may 1854 the @entity52 and @entity53 visited today after @entity47 finished a £ 1.7million conservation project at the cottage			1
almost a mile out of sight of the grand home , secreted away near @entity7 @entity6 's private beach , the children would be left to their own devices there for days on end			0
it was built for them in 1854 and joined only by the caretakers @entity77 and mrs @entity78 , plus occasionally their governesses , they used it to learn skills used by people up and down @entity83 - not that they would ever need them			0
project historian @entity85 told @entity86 : ' the children , particularly the girls , did a lot of cooking - they cooked cakes and biscuits and other treats which were then served to @entity7 @entity6 and @entity18			2
' they also did gardening and grew maize , carrots and all the things you would expect			0
' their vegetable patches were arranged by age , with princess @entity22 's at the far left and princess @entity101 's at the far right			0
they were all exactly the same size and @entity18 would buy the vegetables back off them at market prices to teach them the value of money			1
@entity110 : the timber chalet may be impeccably - finished but it was modest by @entity50 standards , with space only for the live - in caretakers and the children not your average summer house : @entity8 and @entity29 leave the @entity20 chalet today after re-opening it following a £ 1.7million project by @entity47 not quite an @entity123 view , but still pretty : the cottage is near the coast of the @entity23 and @entity7 @entity6 's private beach , which looked out over the @entity33 ' he had been raised in @entity128 with a @entity20 chalet , and wanted to repeat his childhood for his children			1
it was all @entity18 's idea to make them more competitive			2
' we found one occasion in the children 's letters where prince @entity138 was demonstrating a steam engine and it drenched @entity141 's face with water			0
on another , princess @entity143 discovered how scared she was of wasps			0
' a new children 's exhibition on life as a @entity50 child , which forms part of the conservation project , is based on numerous letters by the children which they wrote while staying in the cottage			1
the childhood at @entity21 exhibition also draws on queen @entity6 's detailed daily journals , stored in the royal archives at @entity163			2
today the @entity52 and @entity29 followed in the footsteps of their ancestors by meeting staff , historians and fundraisers at the cottage and main home on the sprawling 342 - acre estate			1
mr @entity85 said : ' they were very engaged with the whole exhibition and were asking lots of questions			0
it 's their family history , after all			0
' grand : the @entity60 were shown round the main house on the @entity23 , which was gifted to the public by @entity182 in 1902 when he decided he did n't want it just your usual family album : the @entity50 couple examined some of the documents and artefacts at the home , which is hosting an exhibition on the life of a royal child lavish : after pushing away the children to stay in the @entity20 chalet , @entity22 would be free to enjoy the sprawling house on the estate , pictured the estate was gifted to the nation by @entity182 on his coronation day in 1902 when he decided he did n't want it , and was later used to house a @entity202 college before being opened fully to the public			2
but @entity6 and @entity18 's most private rooms were sealed for more than 50 years on the orders of @entity182 , only being unlocked with the permission of @entity7 in 1954			2
queen @entity22 bought the estate in 1845 claiming it was ' impossible to imagine a prettier spot ' , and her new husband had a new house designed by @entity213 's master builder of the age @entity215			0
she would spend days on end looking across the @entity33 to @entity217 from her private beach , which was where she swam for the first time			0
despite the privacy of the huge estate , the famously conservative monarch used a curious ' bathing machine ' which concealed her entirely behind a set of curtains while she swam in the sea			2
family home : filled with gold leaf , marble , chandeliers and valuable rugs , the house still contains many of the features which it had during the reign of @entity6 it 's like one i have at home ! not all country houses have full - size marble statues inside as well as out , but @entity21 was home to @entity6 for several months a year the contraption , containing a plumbed toilet and a changing room , was run to the shore along the beach on a long ramp , and pulled back in using a wire rope and winch			1
when the queen had finished changing and got into the water , a veranda on the machine would have curtains drawn across it so those on the shore could not see her			0
she wrote in her journal on 30 july 1847 : ' drove to the beach with my maids and went in the bathing machine , where i undressed and bathed in the sea ( for the 1st time in my life )			0
' i thought it delightful till i put my head under water , when i thought i should be stifled			0

long - reigning monarch spent up to five months a year at @entity21 , a 342 - acre estate on the @entity23
her children would compete to grow vegetables at a cottage and sell the best back at market prices to @entity18
@entity52 and @entity53 *toured* the chalet today after @entity47 finished a £ 1.7m conservation project
