repeat the phrase ' drive on the right ' and remember you want to always be closest to the @entity77			0
on a dual carriageway or motorway remember that the ' fast ' lane is the far left lane and the ' slow ' lane is the far right lane			0
as a beginner , it 's worth sticking to the right lane and take it slowly until you have built up your confidence			0
when approaching a roundabout remember that you must give way to the left and drive anti-clockwise around them			0
it is important to remember that the most dangerous turn is now the left - hand turn because it crosses the other lane of traffic			0

a backseat driver can be more of a help than a hindrance because a reminder to stay on the correct side is certainly welcome as is any help navigating			0
