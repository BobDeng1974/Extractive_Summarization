by @entity0 published : 11:51 est , 1 august 2012 updated : 19:47 est , 1 august 2012 the first @entity2 hospital to be run entirely by a private firm has slashed waiting times and drastically improved patient care			1
@entity6 , a struggling trust in @entity8 , was taken over in february			1
but @entity2 figures show that since the company , @entity11 , stepped in to save the debt - ridden hospital from closure , it has gone from being among the worst - performing trusts in the region to one of the best			1
@entity17 in @entity8 will be run by @entity11 for 10 years under a £ 1billion contract its accident and emergency unit is currently ranked first out of 46 @entity2 trusts in the @entity23 and @entity25 region in terms of waiting times			1
before the takeover it was consistently near the bottom and many patients were forced to wait longer than four hours			1
it now also ranks fifth in terms of the proportion of patients with suspected cancer having tests within two weeks			2
previously it was one of the area ’s worst performers and had missed its target every month since june 2010			2
health care assistants work in the stroke ward at @entity17			1
circle chief executive claims patient care has improved the hospital also claims to have reduced paperwork so nurses spend more time with patients – 62 per cent of their working day , up from 50 per cent – and has even hired a @entity55 - starred chef to improve hospital food			2
however , @entity11 ’s chief executive @entity57 admitted the hospital may not meet its savings target for this year			2
under the arrangement , which was overseen by the @entity11 must ensure @entity6 saves £ 10million by next march , and £ 230million over the next ten years			0
mr @entity57 said although it was ‘ broadly ’ on course to meet these targets , the immediate priority was improving patient care			0
he said he had changed the hospital ’s management style , explaining : ‘ you let the doctors and nurses and the healthcare professionals – who know the patient best and who know their services best – take charge			0
’ the hospital – which serves 160,000 patients near @entity77 – is being closely monitored by the government			0
if deemed a success , other failing @entity2 trusts may follow suit			0
but unions say that it is early days – and warn that the only way the hospital can save the vast sums of money required is by laying off staff			0
@entity57 said the hospital was on course to balance its books by next year @entity91 , assistant general secretary at @entity92 , said : ‘ the staff at @entity17 have worked enormously hard to turn around what not too long ago was a failing hospital , and for this they should be rightly congratulated			1
' however , these early clinical successes should not be used by @entity11 to whitewash persisting financial problems			0
’ before the takeover , the hospital had amassed debts of nearly £ 40million brought about by decades of poor management , failed private finance schemes and lack of funding from the @entity2 .			0

the company that runs @entity17 is ' *co-owned* ' by its workers and clinicians
