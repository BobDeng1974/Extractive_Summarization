these stunning pictures show a trio of daredevil bikers dicing with death as they leap over huge jagged rocks metres above crashing waves			0
the mountain bike athletes were captured taking huge leaps as the sun went down over @entity9 , an island off the coast of @entity11 , @entity12 , on sunday by photographer @entity13			1
the group included renowned professional trial bike riders @entity16 , 25 , @entity17 , 29 , and @entity18 , 19 , who were unfazed by the choppy waters just 10 metres below			1
mr @entity13 said : ' it was incredibly dangerous , the sea was 10 metres below @entity17 , crashing against jagged rocks , also the wind plays a big factor , threatening to blow them off course whilst in the air			1
' it 's a sport based around precision and getting your landing inch perfect			0
if the wind blows too hard it can completely alter your course in the air and throw you off the bike			0
' ' it was a really interesting day and so exhilarating to watch the riders launching themselves over the rocks			0
' it 's not the first time the riders have pulled such a daredevil stunt - last year mr @entity17 and mr @entity18 took part in a promotional video to highlight the need to increase space for cyclists in @entity48 by cycling over some of the capital 's top landmarks			2
