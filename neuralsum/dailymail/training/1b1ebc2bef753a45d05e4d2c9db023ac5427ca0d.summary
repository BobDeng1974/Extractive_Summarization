what happens when you drop a bowling ball and feather at the same time ? the answer seems pretty obvious , with the latter falling slower due to air resistance			1
but in the latest episode of @entity9 professor @entity8 explained how , in the absence of air , both fall at the same rate owing to the laws of gravity			1
to prove the theory he used the world ’s largest vacuum chamber , which normally tests spacecraft , to drop a bowling ball and feather from a great height in space - like conditions			1
to do so he travels to the @entity29 near @entity30 , @entity31 , the world 's biggest vacuum chamber , and drops a bowling ball and feathers ( shown ) - which fall at the same rate the video is from the fourth episode of @entity8 ’s @entity9 , which looked at our origins and place in the universe			1
professor @entity8 visited @entity29 ’s @entity44 near @entity30 , @entity31 to investigate theories of gravity from two great scientific minds : @entity48 and @entity49			1
both theorised that , in the absence of air , objects would fall to @entity54 at the same rate			2
in the 16th century @entity56 scientist @entity48 predicted that , if two objects of different weight were dropped from a height , they would fall at the same rate owing to the law of gravity			1
he supposedly tested this by dropping two balls of different mass from the @entity67 in 1589			0
the following century on 5 july 1687 @entity68 physicist sir @entity49 published a similar theory , his law of universal gravitation , which explained how the force of gravity attracts objects together			0
but on @entity54 there is one noticeable problem to testing these theories , namely air resistance			2
while objects of different weight should fall slower , using an object like a feather seems to defeat the theories as its larger surface area and low mass means it floats to the ground			2
but , so the theory goes , in the absence of air a feather should fall at the same rate as a bowling ball , even given the hugely different weights			1
in the early 20th centurty though @entity92 proposed that the objects were not falling at all			2
rather , if you were to replace one of the objects with , say , a person in a box , it would be impossible for the person to know they were falling			0
and this is what @entity8 concludes with his experiment : from the frame of reference from one of the falling objects in the vacuum it would be impossible to know what forces are acting			1
this was famously proven on the lunar surface in 1971 by commander @entity115 during the @entity117 mission			0
on the moon he dropped a feather and hammer and watched as they fell in the same time , proving that all objects fall at the same rate when air resistance and other forces do not come into play			1
to create an environment devoid of air , similar to the conditions encountered in space , the vacuum chamber professor @entity8 visited is capable of pumping out 30 tons of air until there are just two grams ( 0.004lbs ) left			1
originally built in 1969 to test nuclear propulsion systems , the chamber is now used to test modern spacecraft - but professor @entity8 used it to test this more humble although still impressive experiment			1
first professor @entity8 raises a bowling ball and some feathers high into the chamber , before the air has been removed , and drops them to the floor			1
in this initial experiment the bowling ball drops straight to the ground whereas the feathers float , owing to the air resistance in the room			1
he alludes to the earlier experiment by @entity48 that tested the same hypothesis			0
‘ @entity48 ’s experiment was simple , ’ he explains			0
‘ he took a heavy object , and a light one , and dropped them at the same time to see which fell fastest			0
’ but , while @entity48 ’s experiment proved two similarly shaped objects would fall at the same speed despite being different weights , he did n’t have access to a vacuum chamber in the 17th century to conduct professor @entity8 's more extravagant experiment			1
namely he was n’t able to show that two objects of vastly different weight and surface area , in this case a feather and a bowling ball , would fall at the same rate			1
@entity171 's @entity29 ( shown ) was built in the 1960s to test nuclear propulsion systems but is now usually used to test spacecraft			2
it was made out of aluminium to cope with the radiation but needs an outer concrete ' shell ' to make sure it is strong enough to hold a vacuum inside the @entity29 ( @entity180 ) was built by @entity171 in 1969			0
at 122 feet ( 37.2 metres ) high and 100 feet ( 30.5 metres ) in diameter it is the world ’s largest vacuum chamber			2
originally used for testing nuclear propulsion systems , it has since been repurposed for modern spacecraft			0
in just three hours it is capable of removing almost all of the air in the 800,000 cubic - foot ( 22,650 cubic metres ) chamber , similar to the conditions that would be encountered in space			2
it can also be chilled to temperatures of -160 ° @entity194 )			0
it was made out of aluminium to cope with the radiation but needs an outer concrete ' shell ' to make sure it is strong enough to hold a vacuum inside			0
as the team gears up to perform the experiment the giant door of the chamber closes and the 800,000 cubic feet ( 22,650 cubic metres ) of air is pumped out in a process taking three hours			2
‘ but once it ’s complete there ’s a near perfect vacuum inside , ’ said professor @entity8			1
standing with the control team , one of the engineers presses a button that again releases the bowling ball and feather from a height , as in the first experiment			2
but this time , in a moment that amazes the team that professor @entity8 is with , both dramatically fall at exactly the same rate			1
‘ they came down exactly the same ! ’ exclaims one of the team with professor @entity8			2
‘ holy mackerel , ’ says another			0
professor @entity8 's reasoning for conducting the experiment is not just to prove @entity48 and @entity49 correct			1
it ’s to prove a more interesting hypothesis put forward by @entity92 in the 20th century			0
@entity48 's theory of gravity was famously proven on the lunar surface in 1971 by commander @entity115 during the @entity117 mission ( shown )			0
he dropped a feather and hammer and watched as they fell in the same time , proving that all objects fall at the same rate when air resistance and other forces do not come into play ‘ @entity49 would say that the ball and the feather fall because there ’s a force pulling them down : gravity , ’ he said			1
‘ but @entity92 imagined the scene very differently			0
‘ the “ happiest thought of his life ” [ as @entity92 called it ] was this ; the reason the bowling ball and the feather fall together is because they ’re not falling			1
‘ they ’re standing still			0
there is no force acting on them at all			0
‘ he reasoned that if you could n’t see the background , there ’d be no way of knowing that the ball and the feathers were being accelerated towards the @entity54			0
‘ so he concluded they were n’t			0
’ this slight tweaking of @entity49 ’s earlier theory enabled @entity92 to more accurately define his own @entity270			2
this regards the relationship between space and time but one of its conclusions is that nothing can travel faster than light			0
@entity92 's @entity280 of @entity281 showed how space and time interact , and also looked at the effect gravity has on the universe			1
it was first proposed by @entity92 in 1905			0
illustrated here is @entity29 's @entity287 spacecraft , launched in 2004 with a twin spacecraft to prove @entity92 's theories under @entity49 ’s theory , though , it was thought that changes in gravitational force would be instantaneous - clearly breaking the laws of physics			1
but @entity92 proposed that the objects were not falling at all			2
rather , if you were to replace one of the objects with , say , a person in a box , it would be impossible for the person to know they were falling			0
and this is what @entity8 meant with his final statement			0
from the frame of reference from one of the falling objects in the vacuum it would be impossible to know what forces are acting			2
this became known as the ‘ @entity317 ’ and , in essence , it showed that mass was independent from other forces like gravity			0
long story short ? @entity8 ’s experiment proved the theory of gravity that @entity92 called " the happiest thought of my life ”			1
professor @entity8 showed that , in the absence of air , falling objects are essentially ' at rest ' and it is not possible to know if one of the objects is moving unless there is a ' background '			1
here , former @entity29 astronaut @entity338 is seen floating above @entity54 using a special personal propulsion system in 1984			0

in the latest episode of @entity26 tested the laws of gravity
to do so he travels to the @entity346 near @entity30 , @entity31
this is the world 's biggest vacuum chamber , used to test spacecraft in space - like conditions
in the experiment @entity8 raises a bowling ball and feathers above the ground
almost all of the air is removed from the chamber to make it a vacuum
the objects are then dropped and hit the ground at the same time
this is because there is no air resistance and they ' fall ' at the same rate
but professor @entity8 explains they are not ' falling ' at all , but rather *adhering* to @entity92 's @entity270
