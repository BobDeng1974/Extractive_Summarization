by @entity0 published : 10:49 est , 13 july 2012 updated : 10:57 est , 13 july 2012 it takes all sorts , or so the saying goes , but it seems incredible that anyone would even try to get away with a fraud as unlikely as this			0
but one foolhardy man walked into a bureau de chance in the @entity10 town of @entity11 and asked how much money in @entity10 korunas he would get for a 1,000 euro banknote			1
the cashier told him it was worth 24,000 korunas ( 943 euros / £ 740 ) and the exchange was made			0
pushing his luck : a man managed to exchange this fake 1,000 euro banknote , complete with naked women and love hearts , at a bureau de change in the @entity10			1
there is no 1,000 euro banknote sounds straightforward , but the euro ' banknote ' in question was covered in pictures of naked women and one of its ' € ' logos spelled out ' € ros ' , the @entity36 god of love			2
the stars on the @entity40 flag had even been replaced by love hearts			0
as if that was n't enough to convince the cashier of its somewhat dubious legal tender , there is n't even a 1,000 euro banknote anyway			1
the unfortunate cashier only found out his mistake when he took a load of currency into his local bank and was informed of the note 's comedy origin			2
the bank notified the authorities and the perpetrator was arrested and is now facing up to two years in prison on fraud charges			0
legal tender : if there was a 1,000 euro banknote , then it would look more like this historic : the banknote incident took place in the northern @entity10 town of @entity11			1

as if the *nudity* was n't enough to convince the cashier in @entity11 of the banknote 's dubious legal tender , there is n't a 1,000 euro banknote anyway
