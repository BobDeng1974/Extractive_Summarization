@entity0 has been accused of dumbing down as it suffered its lowest ratings during a @entity4 season for 15 years			1
the classical music channel normally benefits from a ratings boost during its summer concert season but saw its weekly listening figures slump by almost six per cent in a year			1
this year ’s proms featured a performance by the @entity11 and soul singer @entity12 alongside its more traditional fare of @entity14 and @entity15			1
@entity16 @entity12 performed at this year 's proms at the @entity17 - but failed to boost @entity0 's ratings but the populist programme failed to boost the station ’s ratings			1
in the three months to the end of september it attracted a weekly audience of 1.9million , down from 2million in the third quarter of last year			1
although the figure was a slight rise on the number who watched in the second quarter of this year , the total number of listening hours , 11.2million , was the smallest for a @entity4 season			1
@entity0 ’s former controller , @entity33 , stepped down from his post in march			0
he was hit by repeated accusations that the channel had been dumbed down to compete with commercial rivals by scheduling a lighter repertoire including more soundtracks			2
@entity40 also saw its listening figures drop in the last quarter , to 5.2million , down from 5.3million at the same time last year			1
@entity0 insiders insisted the main reason for the reduced listening figures was that it had encouraged more listeners to tune in online via its mobile apps and iplayer service , which are not included in the quarterly listening figures			2
but spokesman for lobby group @entity57 : ‘ @entity0 ’s current editorial strategy did n’t stand much chance of retaining the station ’s audience , still less building it up			0
’ @entity0 ’s former controller , @entity33 , stepped down from his post in march			0
he was hit by repeated accusations that the channel had been dumbed down to compete with commercial rivals earlier this month , culture minister @entity61 revealed at the @entity62 that he never listens to @entity0			0
asked why not , he said : ‘ because i love @entity40 , it ’s an absolutely brilliant station i love it , it plays lovely music and is run by an amazing person			1
‘ what ’s wrong with @entity0 ? that ’s a real half empty question			0
the question is what ’s right with @entity40 ? it plays music i love in an accessible and informal fashion			2
’ the incoming @entity0 controller @entity73 insisted he would not be ‘ dumbing down ’ the station and could dontinue to offer highbrow programmes to his listeners			2
he said : ‘ it ’s one quarter ’s listening figures we are talking about			0
we do n’t yet have a trend			0
i will be addressing it by doing what @entity0 does best – offering complex culture , arts and ideas within the reach of lots of people			0
’ a @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ the station has never chased ratings and its audience has fluctuated around 2 million since records began			2
recent listening figures are consistent with this trend and we have also seen on - demand listening and audience appreciation at record levels			0
