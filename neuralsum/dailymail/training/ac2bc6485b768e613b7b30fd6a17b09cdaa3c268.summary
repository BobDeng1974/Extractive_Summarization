a powerful solar flare blasting its way towards @entity2 could wreak havoc with communications and power systems in the coming days			1
scientists have warned that the ' extreme ' solar storm could affect power grids , satellites and radio transmissions when the flare arrives at the @entity2 's surface			1
but they said they are not ' scared of this one ' , as the worst of its power looks like it will barely skim above the planet and not cause many problems			1
@entity26 , director of the @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 , said it has been several years since @entity2 has had a solar storm of this size coming from sunspots smack in the middle of the sun the flare on the sun barely hits the ' extreme ' on forecasters ' scales , and with its worst effects missing @entity2 it is only looking ' potentially strong ' at most when it arrives at @entity2 as a solar storm			1
' there 's been a giant magnetic explosion on the sun , ' @entity42 explained			2
' because it 's pointed right at us , we 'll at least catch some of the cloud			0
' solar flares are violent explosions on the sun with an energy equivalent to tens of millions of hydrogen bombs @entity55 flares expand the photogenic @entity56 , or @entity57 , across @entity58 and the northern @entity59 most flares occur around sunspots , where intense magnetic fields emerge from the @entity55 's surface the cloud contains highly energized and magnetized plasma that can disrupt the @entity2 's magnetic sphere , and has been known to cause temporary power grid problems			1
new calculations from satellite data show that the worst of the energetic particles streaming from the sun are likely go north or above @entity2 this time , @entity42 said yesterday			1
a solar flare is a violent explosion on the sun with an energy equivalent to tens of millions of hydrogen bombs			1
it occurs when energy stored in ' twisted ' magnetic fields is suddenly released			0
this produces a burst of radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum			0
most flares occur around sunspots , where intense magnetic fields emerge from the sun 's surface into the corona			0
they can be dangerous to humans , but the @entity2 's atmosphere absorbs most of the high - energy rays			0
so while the power grid may see fluctuations because the storm will cause changes in @entity2 's magnetic field , it wo n't knock power systems off line			1
it may cause slight disturbances in satellites and radio transmissions but nothing major			2
' we 're not scared of this one , ' @entity42 added			2
solar storms occur often , especially during peaks in the solar cycle , and do n't directly harm people			2
forecasters with the @entity113 yesterday said the flare already ' caused impacts to high - frequency radio communications on @entity2 today '			0
' a coronal mass ejection ( @entity119 ) associated with this event is likely , but further analysis is necessary to determine whether it will produce geomagnetic storming on @entity2 , ' it added			0
a cme contains billions of tons of energetic hydrogen and helium ions as well as protons and electrons ejected from the sun 's surface			0
on the plus side , sun flares expand the photogenic @entity56 , or @entity57 , so more people in @entity58 and the northern @entity59 will be able to enjoy nature 's light show over the coming days			1
the northern lights usually appear in the night sky in polar latitudes as shimmering green waves of light			0
the spectacle occurs when atoms in the @entity2 's high - altitude atmosphere collide with energetic charged particles from the sun.			0

scientists warn ' extreme ' solar storm could affect power grids and satellites
the solar storm is moving about 2.5 million miles per hour
but @entity59 scientists insist they are not ' scared of this one '
worst of its power looks like it will barely skim above the planet
