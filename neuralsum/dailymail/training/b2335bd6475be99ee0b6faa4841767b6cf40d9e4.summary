by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 11:10 pm on 21st october 2011 few people manage to overshadow the @entity3			1
but all @entity4 had to do today was stand next to her			1
at 6ft 8in in her bare feet and 7ft in her heels , the basketball player towered over the 5ft 4in monarch who had to look skywards to say hello			0
the @entity3 met @entity10 - born @entity9 after a civic reception during her @entity13 tour and immediately saw the funny side			1
at 6ft 8in , basketball player @entity4 towered over the @entity3 ( and most other guests ) @entity13 prime minister @entity16 bows to @entity3 before a reception in the @entity18 in the @entity13 capital of @entity20 the @entity3 enjoyed meeting someone as tall as @entity22 and introduced her to prince @entity23 bow or shake ? in this picture @entity16 appears undecided between accepting the @entity3 's hand and bowing it was in stark contrast to @entity13 prime minister @entity16 , who the day before had greeted the @entity3 as she arrived in the country with a handshake and a bow instead of following protocol with a curtsey			1
and despite the row that ensued , miss @entity16 still refused to curtsey when she met the @entity3 today			1
instead she performed two shallow bows of her head , once as she entered a room at @entity37 , @entity20 , and a second time as she approached the @entity3 whose hand was outstretched			2
she quickly put her hand out to the monarch and shook it			0
she also stood with lips sealed as the @entity10 anthem was played at the start of the reception in the @entity47 â€™s honour			0
she did , however , sing the @entity13 anthem			2
the @entity3 later met miss @entity4 who , without her shoes , is 6ft 8in tall			1
there are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting @entity3 or a member of the @entity54 , but many people wish to observe the traditional forms			2
for men this is a neck bow ( from the head only ) whilst women do a small curtsy			0
other people prefer simply to shake hands in the usual way			1
on presentation to @entity3 , the correct formal address is ' your majesty ' and subsequently ' @entity69 '			2
for male members of the @entity54 the same rules apply , with the title used in the first instance being ' @entity74 ' and subsequently ' sir '			0
for other female members of the @entity54 the first address is conventionally ' @entity74 ' followed by ' @entity69 ' in later conversation			0
www.royal.gov.uk ' oh , ' exclaimed the @entity3 when she came across @entity3 in the foyer of the @entity13 @entity37 building after a civic reception , ' you must be a basketball player			1
' ' yes , i am , ' replied @entity3 as , having no other choice , she made a very deep curtsey			2
then the younger woman asked the @entity3 , with a cheeky grin : ' what gave it away ? ' ' you are very tall , ' said the @entity3 , looking up to make the comment			2
' that must be an advantage			0
' ' it is a bit , ' said @entity3			2
clearly amazed by @entity3 's height , the @entity3 turned to prince @entity23 , who was standing a short distance away ' this is an @entity13 basketball player , ' she said , gesturing towards the sportswoman			1
' yes , ' he said , ' that would be right			0
' dressed in a very long pink @entity103 gown that reached down to her ankles , @entity3 the sportswoman , who was born in @entity108 , @entity101 said later : ' @entity3 is very sweet and prince @entity23 seems like a lot of fun			1
' he was grinning when he made his comment about the @entity3 being right when she guessed i played basketball ' @entity3 's @entity115 father stands at 6ft 4in and her mother is 6ft			2
' i do n't have any brothers and sisters so i expect i 've inherited all the tall genes , ' said the lanky basketballer			0
co-ordinated : the @entity3 and prime minister @entity16 stand next to one another in similar coloured clothes her parents met in a @entity101 nightclub but three months after @entity3 was born her parents separated and her @entity130 mother moved to @entity131 with her			1
it was there , after proving herself in her school 's basketball team , @entity3 became a professional member of @entity131 's @entity138 and also played for the @entity139			2
she also played for the @entity140 in the @entity141			0
she does n't have a boyfriend at present , she said , but it was obvious to everyone standing nearby after the @entity3 had been toasted at the civic reception that to avoid any awkwardness any suitor would need to have some high standing in the community			2
and travelling around in cars ? ' not a problem , ' she said			0
' i just have to move the seat back a bit			0
' then , the sportswoman who without shoes still stands a soaring 6ft 8in in her bare feet , made her way for the door , a head and shoulders above all the other guests			0
earlier , @entity10 - born prime minister @entity16 added to the controversy already surrounding her following her decision not to curtsey before the @entity3 , when she stood with lips sealed as the @entity10 anthem was played at the start of the reception in the @entity47 's honour			1
she did , however , sing the @entity13 anthem			2
eventually the pair sat to discuss @entity13 's political situation and the precarious nature of a minority government the @entity3 and miss @entity16 seemed to be getting along well as they chatted at a reception at @entity37 one is amused : the @entity3 and miss @entity16 laugh together during a speech by the leader of the opposition miss @entity16 , in a veiled reference to the possibility of @entity13 becoming a republic one day , told the @entity3 in her speech that ' we do not know where @entity13 's path of nationhood may lead in the times to come			1
' but she added that she knew for a certain that the @entity3 's journey of service would continue			2
earlier in the day when the pair first met at @entity37 , the @entity3 offered a hand to the @entity13 premier who then reciprocated and shook it and performed a shallow bow			1
ms @entity16 has faced criticism for deciding not to curtsey to the @entity3 when she greeted the monarch as she touched down in the country with prince @entity23			1
as the pair shook hands the republican said : ' good morning your majesty , its lovely to see you again			0
' referring to the bright sunshine blazing down on the grounds , conditions @entity20 has enjoyed since the monarch arrived with the @entity23 on wednesday , the @entity3 replied : ' it 's beautiful again			1
' ms @entity16 said : ' it is a beautiful , beautiful day , and i 'm glad the weather was so good for you yesterday			1
' young girls offer flowers to the monarch as she makes her way through the building in @entity13 's capital ahead of the reception the @entity3 walked among people in the @entity222 while there she also met with @entity224 , the leader of the country 's opposition @entity225 , where they discussed the problems of forming minority governments			1
she was referring to the experiences of miss @entity16 who had weeks of political wrangling before she formed a government after elections that produced no overall winner			0
the @entity3 rarely speaks about her personal views in public and her words were recorded by the waiting media who were given access to the first few moments of the audience			0
but her comments were also formed by recent experiences as there were a number of anxious days before @entity248 was able to form a coalition government with the @entity250 last year			0
mr @entity224 met the monarch for an audience in the morning room of @entity20 's @entity254 after the sovereign had held discussions with ms @entity16			0
the @entity3 wasted no time raising the issue of the precarious state of @entity13 politics saying : ' it is an interesting time			1
' @entity13 's minority government is the first in decades and commentators have said it could easily be threatened by a ministerial misdemeanour or by - election			0
the @entity3 shakes hands with guests ahead of the reception at the @entity13 seat of power in @entity20 a toast is raised to the @entity3 as she sits next to prince @entity23 at @entity37 mr @entity224 replied to the @entity3 's opening statement saying : ' it is never dull , we play our politics tough in this country and give no quarter , @entity13 society is always dynamic			1
' he made the @entity3 laugh when he added : ' we like to think we 're the happening place your majesty			0
' the monarch replied ' a minority government is always a difficult thing to organise ' , before the talks continued behind closed doors for almost 20 minutes , half the time the sovereign spent with the prime minister			0
the @entity3 and the prime minister chatted about the previous day 's events , when the royal couple toured @entity292 in a vip motor launch and attended the flower festival			1
the @entity3 said : ' it was very popular , there were lots of people there to see the boat go past ' , and ms @entity16 replied : ' i suspect there were more people because you were there			1
' the monarch added : ' it was very nice to be able to do that and see the flowers			0
i had no idea that they do that every year			0

@entity16 appears unable to decide whether to bow or shake hands
@entity4 amuses the @entity3 and prince @entity23
the royal couple are on their second day of their tour of @entity13
