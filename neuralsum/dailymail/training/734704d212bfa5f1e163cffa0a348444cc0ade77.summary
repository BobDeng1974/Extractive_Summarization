however , today the judge , who heard evidence at a hearing in the @entity3 of the @entity3 in @entity29 , ruled against her , adding : ' one can not enjoy a quality of life if one is n't alive			0

chemotherapy and radiotherapy are routine follow - up treatments which doctors said would give @entity34 up to an 86 per cent chance of survival			2

' case : @entity93 is at the centre of a legal dispute over his own cancer treatment experts said the @entity98 was one of the leading countries on the disease and that if parents looked elsewhere they would be ' doing their child a disservice			1
' after hearing the case over four days mr @entity13 said : ' before radiotherapy was developed patients variably and also invariably died			1
' he said he found it hard to believe ' caring clinicians ' would keep back alternative therapies which would work on children			2
delivering his judgment , he said : ' the mother has been through a very stressful time			0
' this sort of news is every parent 's worst nightmare , and i have sympathy for her , but i 'm worried that her judgment was gone awry on the question of the seriousness of the threat which @entity16 faces			1
' there was a time when she agreed with the therapy			0
i express the hope that when the mother has reflected on the outcome she will come to terms with it			0
' i am sure she will support @entity135 through the very difficult times he has ahead			0
he needs both his parents to support him			0
' the judge said the case ' tilted well in the favour ' of @entity16 's father and the hospital trust			0

mrs @entity2 , who stared intently at the judge as the decision was read out , was told she could not appeal the case in the @entity3			1
ms @entity2 had told the court she was not a ' bonkers mother '			1

and she told the judge that she wanted medics to consider alternatives			2
@entity16 's father @entity62 said he was ' relieved ' following the decision to give it the go ahead today			0
@entity181 was with his son @entity16 in hospital so was not at the hearing at the to hear the judgement handed down			1
in a statement issued following today 's ruling his solicitor @entity186 said : ' mr @entity93 is relieved that the judge has been able to make a final ruling on @entity16 's treatment			1
' @entity135 's health and recovery has always been mr @entity93 ' priority			2
while he respected @entity16 's mother 's views , his own opinion , following in depth discussions with doctors , has always been that @entity135 should have the treatment			2
