the @entity1 's decision to ban rifle maker @entity2 from airing a commercial during @entity5 has led to protests from @entity8 's gun lobby			1
in the clip , a former marine speaks about protecting his family in their quaint , suburban home			1
he pulls into the driveway and then stops on the front walk , briefly scanning the neighborhood for snipers and suicide bombers			2
banned : the @entity20 advert shows a family safe and well in their suburban home ' no one has the right to tell me how to defend them , ' he says of his wife and baby			1
the company 's logo then flashes on the screen - a silhouette of ' the most effective tool for the job ' , an @entity38 assault rifle			1
the ad was banned last month for flouting the @entity1 's gun rule which state : ' firearms , ammunition or other weapons are prohibited ; however , stores that sell firearms and ammunitions ( e.g. , outdoor stores and camping stores ) will be permitted , provided they sell other products and the ads do not mention firearms , ammunition or other weapons			1
' following the @entity1 's ruling , @entity2 offered to replace the company 's logo with an @entity8 flag and / or the words ' shall not be infringed '			1
all @entity8 : the man in the advert is a @entity62 returning from duty speaking about his wife and child , the @entity62 then says : ' no one has the right to tell me how to defend them ' a silhouette of ' the most effective tool for the job ' then flashes on screen - an assault rifle from @entity2 the @entity5 will be played in @entity75 between the @entity76 , whose quarterback @entity77 is pictured here ( left ) , and the @entity80 last year 's @entity5 , broadcast by @entity81 from @entity82 , saw record prices for advertising spots			1
the @entity85 put the price at $ 3.5 million to $ 4 million for 30 seconds			2
less than 20 years ago , a half - minute of @entity88 ad time cost less than $ 1 million			2
that money now buys the largest tv audience in the @entity8 two years ago , a record of more than 111 million @entity8 watched the @entity92 beat @entity93 , and many paid close attention to the dozens of commercials aired during game breaks			0
@entity97 , head of sports for @entity99 , which tracks viewership , said : ' there 's nothing to compare it to			0
maybe the @entity103 or some of the music ( awards ) shows , but not really			0
' the company was willing to replace the gun with an @entity8 flag or the words ' shall not be infringed '			2
but the @entity1 would n't budge			0
in an interview on @entity112 , @entity20 ceo @entity110 said : ' we actually went to the rule box and pulled out their set of rules and got a big no. ' petitions in support of the ad have followed - such as one titled ' allow @entity2 to show their @entity88 commercial supporting @entity123 ! ' - along with cries of support on the company 's facebook page			1
one poster , @entity129 , said : ' alcohol and automobiles are both responsible for more deaths than firearms			0
but the @entity1 does n't seem to have a problem with either of those			0
' a @entity137 video in response to the ban complaining that the @entity1 has become ' politicized ' now boasts more than two million views - far more than the original commercial			0
@entity142 will pit the @entity76 against the @entity80 on february 2 at the @entity143 in @entity75 .			0

in the clip , a former marine speaks about protecting his family
he talks about the ' most effective tool for the job '
