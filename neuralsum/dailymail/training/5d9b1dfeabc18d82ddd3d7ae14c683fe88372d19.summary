by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 14:31 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 17:49 est , 21 january 2013 prince @entity3 has said it is ' easy to forget ' who he is in the @entity6 in a candid interview ahead of his return to the @entity9 there is only one rule as far as the soldier prince is concerned : work hard , play hard			1
but in one of the most candid admissions of his interview , @entity3 remarks that a concerned prince @entity16 frequently attempts to remind him of what is required of the third in line to the throne			1
@entity3 confesses he ‘ let himself and his family down ’ after being photographed cavorting naked in @entity24 last year , but , unsurprisingly given his comments , is largely unrepentant			1
the 28 - year - old royal concedes he should have acted in a more ‘ princely ’ manner but says the media should never have published ‘ private ’ photos of him playing strip billiards with a group of women he had met in his hotel bar			1
like many headstrong young men , @entity3 says he shrugs off his father ’s wise words of caution , even if he is heir to the throne			1
‘ my father ’s always trying to remind me about who i am and stuff like that			2
but it ’s very easy to forget about who i am when i am in the @entity6			0
everyone ’s wearing the same uniform and doing the same kind of thing , ’ he says			0
‘ i have always said work hard , play hard			0
i will always be enjoying the job … however long it may carry on for , and then i have the other job to fall back on			2
’ he adds : ‘ certain people remind me , “ remember who you are , so do n’t always drop your guard ”			2
at the end of the day i probably let myself down [ in @entity24 ] , i let my family down , i let other people down			1
‘ but i was in a private area and there should be a certain amount of privacy that one should expect			1
back at home all my close friends rallied around me and were great			0
prince @entity3 on his controversial @entity24 trip , left , and right , his father hard at work in @entity70 today one of the boys : prince @entity3 says everyone is the same in the army and he enjoys blending in ‘ it was probably a classic case of me being too much @entity6 and not enough prince			1
it ’s a simple case of that			0
’ the leaked pictures were taken on a riotous boys - only pre-deployment holiday to @entity24 last summer , weeks before he flew out to @entity80			1
they show a naked @entity3 cupping his genitals as he hugs an unnamed blonde , who is also nude			1
the pair had apparently been playing a game of strip billiards			0
it is believed the photos , sold to a @entity90 entertainment website , were taken by one of the guests invited back to his £ 5,000 - a - night suite in the @entity94			2
their publication provoked a debate over whether @entity3 violated his own privacy in showing such a lapse of judgment , and raised questions over the role of his taxpayer - funded @entity104 protection officers			1
a rare glimpse of his day job : prince @entity3 inspects his @entity108 helicopter before take - off from @entity109 @entity110 prince @entity3 inspects his @entity111 before lift off on a night mission from @entity109 although the pictures were seen around the world , his solicitors threatened action against any @entity9 newspaper that published them			1
only one , the @entity120 , chose to do so but @entity121 took no further action			0
@entity3 , however , says it is ‘ unacceptable ’ that anything was published , knowing that he was about to be deployed			2
‘ yes people might look at it going , “ yes it was letting off steam , it ’s all understandable now , he was going off to @entity80 ”			0
' well , the papers knew that i was going out to @entity80 anyway , so the way i was treated by them i do n’t think is acceptable			0
’ @entity3 openly admits that one of the reasons he likes his job as an @entity108 pilot so much is that it takes him away from the media interest			1
hard at work : captain @entity140 , as he is known in the army , in the cockpit of his @entity108 helicopter @entity3 walks towards the @entity145 ( very high ready - ness ) tent to start his 12 hour shift , at @entity109 southern @entity80 but he says that being in the @entity148 requires both himself and his brother to constantly ‘ flick a switch ’ between their different personas			1
‘ there are three “ me ” s – one in the @entity6 , one sort of socially in my own private time , and then one with the family and stuff like that , ’ he says			0
‘ no one back home gets to see the stuff that i do while i ’m at work and there ’s no reason why they should ... so whenever anybody sees me they presume that i ’m off gallivanting around			0
’ although he repeatedly says he ‘ does n’t want to whinge ’ , @entity3 lays the blame for his ‘ bad boy ’ public person at the feet of the media			2
@entity110 prince @entity3 ( foreground ) or just plain captain @entity140 as he is known in the @entity6 , relaxes with computer football games with his fellow @entity111 crew , in @entity109 prince @entity3 celebrates after scoring a goal during computer football game with his fellow @entity111 pilot capt @entity179 ( left ) prince @entity3 relaxes with fellow pilots in their @entity145 ( very high ready - ness ) at the @entity9 controlled flight - line in @entity109 southern @entity80 ‘ my father always says , “ do n’t read it , it ’s rubbish ” [ but ] i am surprised how many people in the @entity9 do actually read it			1
of course , if something is written about me i want to know what is said , ’ he says			0
‘ i do n’t believe there is such a thing as a private life any more ... i am not going to sit here and whinge [ but ] there ’s the internet , there ’s @entity199			0
' everyone ’s phone has a camera on it now			0
you ca n’t move an inch without people judging you , that ’s the way life goes			0
’ asked how far his mistrust of the media goes back , @entity3 says sharply : ‘ i think it ’s fairly obvious how far back it goes			2
it ’s when i was very small			0
’ but he adds : ‘ but at least i have a job , many other people do n’t			2

soldier prince says his army officer job means he often forgets who he is
the 28 - year - old says prince @entity16 tells him ' remember who you are '
he says his @entity24 pictures were ' too much army , not enough prince '
but @entity3 says he ought to be afforded a ' certain amount of privacy '
