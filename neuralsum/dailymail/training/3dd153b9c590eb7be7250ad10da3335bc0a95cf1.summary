by @entity0 artist 's muse : commons chiefs have commissioned a £ 10,000 painting of @entity5 leader @entity5 to be hung in the @entity6 deputy prime minister @entity5 has defied public uproar over large sums of public money being spent on portraits of mps – and agreed to pose for one himself			1
commons chiefs have commissioned a £ 10,000 painting of the @entity5 leader to be hung in the @entity6			1
the decision comes just weeks after mps were denounced for spending £ 250,000 on portraits of a raft of fellow parliamentarians , including a £ 10,000 picture of pensions secretary @entity20			0
mr @entity5 ’s office has defended the move , saying it was the @entity23 , not the @entity5 leader , which commissioned the work			2
but last night mr @entity5 faced calls to follow the example of @entity29 deputy leader @entity28 , who two years ago pulled out of a similar taxpayer - funded project because it would not be right in the current economic climate			1
@entity29 mp @entity33 said that if mr @entity5 refused to decline ‘ this outrageous extravagance ’ , it would prove how ‘ out of touch ’ he was with hard - working families			1
‘ past decisions on commons arts commissions are one thing but going ahead with this in such economically difficult times can not be justified , ’ said mr @entity33			1
‘ with hard - working people struggling to make ends meet , this is no time for @entity5 to let the taxpayer fork out a small fortune just so he can be immortalised in oils			2
’ the @entity49 art collection is overseen by a special committee of mps which advises speaker @entity52 and commissions paintings and sculptures			0
the collection , designed to record 600 years of parliamentary history , now has so many portraits of mps that they fill several corridors in the @entity61 block opposite @entity62			0
sources told @entity64 that the idea of getting mr @entity5 to pose for a portrait was first suggested several years ago but only recently got the go - ahead from the deputy pm			0
how @entity5 might have looked painted by @entity69 during the artist 's blue period the @entity5 leader imagined in @entity73 's pop - art style and here 's how he might have looked if painted on a brick wall by the street artist @entity76 commons officials are refusing to issue details of the commission , including the name of the artist , as it is ‘ commercially sensitive ’			2
last night , a spokesman for mr @entity5 said decisions on portraits were made by the @entity49 ’ art committee and not by the government or the deputy prime minister			0
‘ party leaders and ministers are often selected and we agreed to the request on that basis , ’ he added .			0
