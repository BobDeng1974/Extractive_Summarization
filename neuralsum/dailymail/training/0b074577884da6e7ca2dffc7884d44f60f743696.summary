by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:36 est , 5 april 2013 updated : 18:41 est , 5 april 2013 @entity2 has admitted he has been caught speeding			2
the @entity4 and leadership hopeful opted to attend a speed awareness course on tuesday rather than take penalty points on his licence			2
mr @entity2 said he was ‘ bang to rights ’ when caught going 56mph in a 50mph zone on a motorway in his @entity13 constituency			1
traffic trouble : shadow chancellor @entity2 admitted he had been caught speeding in his own constituency , and went on a speeding course to avoid penalty points he blamed roadworks for his misdemeanour , as temporary speed restrictions were in force			1
mr @entity2 has form when it comes to motoring offences – in april 2010 , he was caught on his mobile phone while driving between his constituency and @entity27			1
at the time , he was fined £ 60 and was meant to have received three penalty points on his licence			0
however , yesterday the @entity4 said he had decided to take the safety driving course because ‘ i currently have no points on my licence and would like to keep it that way ’			1
let the train take the strain : the speeding revelation is embarrassing for @entity39 's @entity38 , which has sought to exploit @entity41 's parking faux pas for political gain writing on his blog , mr @entity2 appeared to blame long - running roadworks for his error			1
he said : ‘ like many local people , i was caught out by the never - ending roadworks on the @entity48			1
pulling on to the motorway at @entity50 i realised too late that the speed restrictions were still in place			0
‘ i was caught and bang to rights – doing 56 in a 50 mile restriction zone			2
going too far , too fast , you might say			0
‘ i paid my fine and chose to attend a speed awareness course			0
i currently have no points on my licence and would like to keep it that way			0
which is why , this week , i ended up in the @entity62 with 39 others			0
’ her claimed the course – which allows drivers to escape penalty points by undergoing training the dangers of speeding was ‘ very professional and actually really worthwhile ’			0
the driver of @entity41 's car reversed into the disabled parking space outside @entity74 services on the @entity76 side of the @entity77 mr @entity2 went on : ‘ what hit home were the statistics which link speed to car deaths			1
at 20 mph , less than 10 per cent of people will lose their lives if hit by a car			2
but the probability rises exponentially , going above 40 per cent at 40mph			0
‘ our course instructors explained that casualty rates have fallen over the past decade , as drivers have become more aware and car design has improved			2
the worrying thing is that this trend has started to reverse in recent years			0
’ he went on to claim that his own misdemeanor reinforced his call for more 20mph routes in near schools and residential areas in @entity50 in his constituency .			1
