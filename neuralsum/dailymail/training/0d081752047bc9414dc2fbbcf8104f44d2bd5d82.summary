by @entity0 published : 05:16 est , 17 april 2012 updated : 06:54 est , 17 april 2012 it was often likened to a skip on wheels , yet somehow managed to become a symbol of the @entity6 era			1
but after more than 40 years on the road , @entity7 has finally decided to consign the much - ridiculed @entity9 to the scrapheap			1
the box - like sedan - first produced in 1970 - became the most joked - about car in the world due to its shoddy construction and infamous unreliability			1
end of the line : a 1970 version of the @entity18 , which is being ditched after its @entity7 makers announced it would no longer manufacture the ridiculed model once - popular : the @entity18 made a promising start thanks to strong exports , like this one in @entity23 , which brought in much - needed funds to the then @entity6 heading for the scrapheap : one of the later versions of the @entity27 , a @entity27 , rolls through central @entity28 yesterday as its manufacturers reveal it would be ceasing production of the model ' it 's time to say good - bye , ' said @entity35 , spokesman for makers @entity36 , who announced yesterday that it would halt manufacturing			1
' the demand for " classical " models has fallen drastically			1
' the @entity18 , known across the old @entity6 as the ' zhiguli ' and in the @entity42 as the ' @entity27 ' , has sold more than 20million worldwide and is still widely driven on @entity7 roads			1
although it broke down regularly , its legend rested on the knowledge of drivers all over the country to fix it and get it going again			1
loaded @entity9 : this image is taken from the @entity50 for @entity52 calendar 2007 , which shows the many uses for a @entity18 in and around the capital @entity54 pursuit vehicle : the @entity18 was the model of choice for some police forces off - roading : @entity18 's 4x4 @entity60 , first produced in 1955 , which became popular in @entity61 executive : a limousine converted from a @entity18 parked in @entity64 in @entity65 , @entity66 , in may last year critics say the latest version , the @entity27 , was outdated the moment it first rolled off the assembly line three decades ago			1
but unlike more sophisticated @entity74 models , it seemed to cope better with the @entity76 cold			1
@entity78 tycoon @entity77 was once a proud owner of a dark blue model and even asked his first wife @entity80 to change the gears for him - so he could feel what it was like to drive an automatic			1
a man goes into a service - station and asks : ' can i have a windscreen - wiper for my @entity9 ? ' ' okay ' replied the man in the garage			2
' it seems a fair swap '			2
how do you double the value of a @entity18 ? fill the petrol tank			2
what occupies the last 16 pages of the @entity96 ? the bus and train @entity98 's the difference between a @entity100 and a @entity9 ? you can shut the door on a @entity103 's @entity102 do you call a @entity9 in the winter ? a freezer there is a big competition at my local pub. first prize is a @entity9			2
second prize is two @entity112			2

' he screamed " stop it			0
you 're doing everything wrong ! you 'll burn my clutch out			0
" ' i was trying my best			0
i got out , slammed the door and screamed " drive yourself ! " and stormed off			0
he was like a typical @entity7 man			0
' the name ' @entity18 ' meant ' boat ' in old @entity7 and the badge depicts a @entity128 sailing ship			0
the model made a promising start to life after being partly modelled on the 1966 @entity133 sedan			0
it became a successul export due to its competitive price and @entity138 - friendly mechanics and brought in important funds for the cash - strapped @entity140 in the 1980s and 1990s			0
the company even ventured into the realms of the roadster when it unveiled a concept car in 2003 and entered the @entity146 in 2008 and 2009			0
@entity147 bought a 25 per cent share in @entity36 in a $ 1billion deal in 2008 , which was expected to result in new @entity18 models being produced , but the car suffered a slump in popularity and the decision to sound the death knell came after a 76 per cent fall in sales in the first three months of this year			1
