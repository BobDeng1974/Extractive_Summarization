by @entity0 in @entity1 after the semi-final we perhaps feared we may get after the astonishing events of tuesday in @entity6 , there will now be one overwhelmingly satisfied team left in @entity8			1
that team is called @entity10			1
not only will @entity12 and his players have an extra day to prepare for sunday 's final against @entity15 , they will head to @entity16 knowing that they will have more than that advantage in their legs			1
while the @entity20 played for just 45 minutes competitively in beating @entity8 - as odd as that sounds - sunday 's opponents have been through the wringer here , physically and emotionally			1
what @entity10 will also perhaps be aware of is they are beginning to look by far the superior team			1
with @entity50 sticking to their modus operandi and showing a typical unwillingness to engage consistently with @entity15 , this was a game that - to invoke an old cliche - needed an early goal to liven it up			1
in fact , the longer it went on it just needed a goal			0
it was , in truth , awful and @entity10 will have watched in their hotel realising they have little to fear ahead of their date at the @entity68			1
the final will not be one - sided			1
this @entity34 has had its one freakish can - you - believe - it moment and @entity8 were the victims			1
@entity10 , though , have shown themselves to be the outstanding team in this tournament			1
more pertinently , they are one remaining team that can claim to have improved as they have gone along			0
@entity10 have a midfield that has functioned brilliantly from the opening game and have talented players on the bench who are in form			1
they have the competition 's best goalkeeper , a defensive unit that is imperfect but stable and have a capacity to score goals from all positions			2
not phased : @entity91 's @entity50 endured a tough opening period but held it together @entity50 started with a bewildering 5 - 1 defeat of @entity94 in @entity95 and kept on surprising people			1
late goals have become their speciality and here last night they almost did it again			0
they had been second best for large parts of the 90 minutes of normal play but would have won it at the death had @entity104 somehow not stretched out a leg to deny @entity106 when he seemed set to score from an angle			0
immediately afterwards , @entity104 succumbed to cramp			0
it was that type of tackle			0
@entity50 , though , have stopped getting better and so , we must say , have finalists @entity15			2
having been guided through this @entity34 - on and off the field - by @entity27 , the @entity113 arrived here without their other in - form player , @entity115			1
they missed the @entity118 forward and on sunday they will miss him again			2
certainly on this occasion , @entity27 could not do it on his own			2
an early free - kick briefly threatened to bother @entity124 goalkeeper @entity123			2
in the second period of extra time , meanwhile , a run down the right fashioned a chance at the far post for @entity130 but it was n't taken			0
tied up : @entity50 's great attacking threat @entity106 was restricted to just six touches in the first half danger man : @entity15 forward @entity136 emerged as the most imposing threat on the pitch early on but @entity27 was actually jeered by the crowd here with 20 minutes of normal time left when his over hit free - kick ballooned out of play			1
that summed up his evening			0
in fact , it summed up everybody ’s evening			0
@entity15 's best player was actually the @entity149 forward @entity136			1
it was the former @entity151 wide player who troubled @entity50 the most			0
in central defender @entity153 , however , @entity50 had the game ’s stand out performer and it was his effort , allied to the @entity124 team 's usual discipline and organisation , that got them through to the shoot - out			2
during the extra time period , former @entity163 defender @entity162 tweeted that @entity153 had contributed the best defensive performance of the tournament			0
that the @entity168 defender was asked to take @entity50 ’s first kick in the shoot - out , though , was peculiar			2
was that @entity91 ’s first big mistake of the tournament ? right stuff : @entity174 ( left ) was immense at wing - back and @entity15 played away from him close quarters : @entity177 ( centre left ) was never far from @entity27 , though @entity136 put him in two minds it seemed so , given that specialist @entity181 – who had scored an injury - time penalty winner against @entity183 - did n’t take one			1
whatever the case , there was little surprise that @entity153 missed his kick			0
certainly @entity153 had a good game over 120 minutes			0
it says something , though , that on a night that pitted two teams of repute , we talked about defenders as the penalty competition neared			2
sadly , that was how it was			0
given the success that @entity201 has had this tournament by sticking rather than twisting , it was never likely that @entity50 would take the game to their opponents			0
had @entity15 scored then we may have seen a more open game			1
as it turned out @entity50 strangled it			0
perhaps we have the right final			2
we do probably have the best two teams			0
it ’s just that one is looking a little better than the other			0
no sympathy : @entity15 fans remind @entity8 of their 7 - 1 demolition the night before			1

@entity27 *slots* first penalty as @entity15 win semi-final 4 - 2 in shootout
@entity15 scored all four penalties after it was 0 - 0 after *extra-time*
@entity8 's great rivals now meet @entity10 in sunday 's @entity34 final
despite being revered around the world , @entity27 was booed
