by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson @entity1 did such a good job of turning @entity3 into an all - action box - to - box @entity5 midfielder that he never really fitted back in at @entity7 when he went home in 2011			1
the 27 - year - old is now worth far more to an @entity11 club with aspirations of winning the @entity5 than he is to @entity7 , desperate for a replacement for @entity14			1
@entity15 will replace @entity16 with goals and energy in midfield far more effectively than he could replace @entity14 as the pass - master of the @entity22 ' midfield			1
he thrived on the responsibility and the anarchy of so many top flight @entity11 games			2
there was less responsibility given him at the @entity44 and there are fewer end - to - end encounters to bring out the best in him			0
a @entity7 midfielder needs to pick his way through a 10 - man defence more than he needs to take advantage of the space that an open game naturally creates			2
@entity3 never shied away from admitting it was more of a culture shock to go home to @entity7 than it was to move to @entity58 at 16			1
when @entity7 bought him back they did so with the intention of making him the long - term replacement for @entity14 but it was difficult to embrace that new role when @entity14 ’s continued presence in the team meant @entity3 often had to find a place elsewhere with another set of responsibilities			1
often in big games , especially in his second season , he did not play at all			0
main man : @entity3 found it hard to dislodge @entity14 and get into the @entity7 team regular : @entity74 is another main player in the @entity22 side 's midfield on his way : @entity16 will leave @entity27 after 13 years and countless trophies at @entity79 ‘ if you play one game , the next , and the next but then comes the big game away to @entity83 and we are losing 4 - 0 and you are not even warming up then it gets you down , ' he told @entity86 at the start of the season when asked about the disappointment of missing out on @entity7 ’s 2012 - 13 @entity91 run			1
‘ it ’s all about continuity			0
it ’s more mental than anything else			0
everyone knows @entity14 and @entity74 are very good			1
i know what i can do , but sometimes you think , " come on , give me a chance boss "			0
' last season under @entity102 it seemed he had become a first - team regular but @entity102 failed to land a trophy and fans were happy to blame @entity3			2
he has always felt harshly judged by supporters who have perhaps never forgiven him for leaving as a teenager			0
‘ in @entity11 , you always have that extra bit of freedom as a player			0
you know that , if you misplace a pass , the fans are going to support you , ’ he said			0
‘ and , in my case , it was a bit different because the supporters saw in me someone who had been at the club as a kid , left and then returned for a big fee			0
’ coming of age : @entity3 grew up as a player and man at @entity34 and eventually became club captain he has also struggled to come to terms with the demands of supporters sometimes not even happy when they win the league			1
‘ you win the league with 100 points and finish a record 15 points clear of @entity136 but some people are not happy ’ he said of @entity7 ’s last trophy - winning campaign			2
‘ @entity7 are not just about winning leagues and lifting trophies			2
when we played @entity141 last season and won 4 - 0 people were not happy because they had slightly more possession than us			0
it ’s incredible , it was n’t as if we had won 1 - 0 ; we scored four ! ’ those demands have taken their toll and as much as his heart will be heavy if ultimately he has to leave his boyhood club for the second time , he will know it will only help his career			0
there were tears from his proud father @entity154 the day he was presented back at @entity7 but the homecoming has not gone to plan and just maybe the truth is the @entity5 was where he belonged all along			1
@entity157 bound : @entity3 posted a selfie alongside @entity159 on @entity33 's flight to @entity161 for @entity163 training international recognition : @entity3 remains a regular in the @entity33 squad and will travel to the @entity163			1

@entity3 has struggled to break through at @entity7
@entity14 and @entity74 have kept @entity15 out of @entity7 team
@entity33 international midfielder looks likely to return to @entity5
@entity3 made his name as *influential* captain at @entity34
@entity27 could sign him as replacement for *outgoing* @entity16
