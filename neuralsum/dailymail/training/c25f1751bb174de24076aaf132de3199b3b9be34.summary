created by @entity6 firm @entity5 toys , the @entity3 is an add - on gadget for homemade paper planes that gives them a small motor and propeller			0
when connected to the @entity5 app , the smartphone is used as a remote control to fly the plane wirelessly - and a single charge can last up to 10 minutes			1
the plane can then be controlled via @entity23 using an app on a smartphone , right , which shows the plane 's altitude			0
@entity5 's motor can run for 10 minutes on a single charge the £ 30 kit , which goes on sale next month , has a @entity23 receiver built - in so it can communicate wirelessly with the @entity34 app. ' pilots ' can control the height of the plane , and make it turn left or right , using their handset and the app even gives information such as the plane ’s altitude			1
however , there is one snag - users still need to provide they own paper plane , although the firm helpfully supplies instructions for making what it claims is the ultimate design			0
the kit , which clips onto the plane , has a motor connected by a carbon fibre shaft to a propeller			1
‘ just build a plane out of a piece of standard paper , attach the motor , and open up the app on your phone - it 'll fly for up to ten minutes on a single charge , ’ the firm said			2
it also encourages owners to experiment with their own designs for planes			0
‘ at @entity5 , we strongly encourage experimentation , and part of the fun is tweaking your airplane designs to achieve the best results			0
’ the firm added the gadget is made of a highly durable carbon fiber composite , so it will not break with normal use - however , it warns ‘ that does not mean it is indestructible ! ’ the £ 30 kit does n't come with paper planes included but @entity5 has created an instructional video , pictured , on how to build the most aerodynamic paper aircraft that will fit the motor and propeller			2

@entity5 3 contains a motor and propeller attached to a carbon fibre shaft
it can be fitted to any paper plane and will fly for up to 10 minutes
a built - in *bluetooth* receiver connects wirelessly to a smartphone app
pilots control the plane using their handset and get stats including altitude
