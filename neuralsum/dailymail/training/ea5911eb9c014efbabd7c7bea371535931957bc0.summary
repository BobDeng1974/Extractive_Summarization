@entity120 mayhem : @entity1 sent off @entity11 's @entity122 during a fiery clash with @entity124 in 2007 one that got away : @entity1 did not send @entity126 off despite a lunge at @entity128 at @entity12 - the @entity129 went on to score two penalties as @entity124 beat their @entity120 rivals 2 - 1 back in 2007 @entity5 is duty - bound to speak with @entity1 about @entity6 ’s claims and they are expected to respond to the club ’s letter within the next few days			1

‘ i do n’t mean any disrespect against any referees but anyone watching the game can see there were two clear penalties that were n’t given or should have been given			0
accusation : @entity52 claimed that @entity1 had abused @entity52 's @entity53 during a game last season cleared : @entity1 returned to refereeing after investigations found him not guilty of any wrong - doing @entity6 assistant manager @entity156 has vowed @entity6 will not let the situation affect their preparations for hosting @entity159 on saturday			1

' i wo n't talk about this situation , i prefer to stay away from this and just focus on the game on saturday , " he said			0
' this type of situation does n't help us in this moment , for this game , it 's away , and we 'll see in the next couple of days what 's happening with this			0
' i read it this morning ; when you are in the games sometimes you can see or hear something , but history has led me to stay away from these things			0
' ‘ that would have changed the game completely but we were n’t given them and , of course , we are angry and upset about this			0
‘ i am saying that should not be forgotten in the overall analysis of the game and they need to be said			0
we do n’t want to be judged by our young , handsome , good - looking players			0
we just want what ’s fair			0
we can be a * * * * * * s as well			0
’ incredibly , last sunday ’s match was @entity1 ’s first appointment at @entity12 since his questionable handling of the @entity120 derby won 2 - 1 by @entity124 in october 2007			1
on that occasion he sent off @entity11 ’s @entity122 , allowed @entity124 ’s @entity126 to escape after he launched a kung - fu kick at @entity128 and ignored a penalty appeal when @entity200 clashed with @entity201			1
this weekend @entity65 will be officiating saturday 's @entity67 third - round tie at the @entity68 between @entity69 and @entity70			1
@entity203 , @entity205 the @entity120 derby at @entity12 , @entity1 looked ready to book @entity11 ’s @entity122 but , after apparently consulting @entity124 ’s @entity206 , sent the defender off			1
he failed to show @entity126 a red card for a waist - high lunge and denied the hosts what looked a penalty in the final minutes			2
he did not referee an @entity11 match for five years and the game against @entity6 was his first return to @entity12			1
@entity216 , @entity217 the winding - up of one of his businesses in the @entity221 , @entity1 was suspended from refereeing and finally sacked by the referees ’ governing body , the @entity32 , for breaching his contract			2
he was accused of having business debts of nearly £ 200,000 and told he would never referee again , but he was reinstated that february after clearing his name			0
bashing @entity231 , @entity227 a match between @entity229 and @entity230 , @entity1 sent off @entity232 for two bookable offences — dissent and diving			2
at half - time , he allegedly said to members of the @entity230 staff : ‘ how do you work with @entity232 all week ? ’ seething spurs , @entity241 referee had already caused problems between @entity70 and @entity56 when he failed to award @entity70 a goal in 2005 after @entity246 ’ lob clearly crossed the line			0
five years later , he correctly , if controversially , allowed a goal to stand when @entity249 tapped the ball in after goalkeeper @entity251 thought he had a free - kick			0
cleared of race jibe , @entity253 was accused of aiming a racist insult towards @entity52 midfielder @entity53 during their 3 - 2 home defeat by @entity56			1
the @entity59 and the @entity258 launched inquiries into the incident , but a month later , dropped the investigation and @entity1 was cleared			2
