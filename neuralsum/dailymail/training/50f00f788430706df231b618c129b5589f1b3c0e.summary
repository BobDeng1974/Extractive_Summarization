backing return : @entity1 has called for the return of 1960s and 70s panel show many a slip as a gentle daily reminder of language laws it entertained her as a teenager and taught her much of what she knows about grammar today			1
and now @entity1 has called for the return of 1960s and 70s panel show many a slip as a gentle daily reminder of language laws			1
yesterday miss @entity1 , 59 , who is best known for her book @entity15 : the @entity17 to @entity18 , said she thinks the programme was axed because pointing out mistakes have become associated with ‘ mean - spiritedness , snobbishness and judgmentalism ’			1
it means errors such as a misplaced apostrophe or forgotten comma – which can change the meaning of a sentence altogether – are allowed to go unmentioned			2
and as a result poor grammar has crept into acceptable use			0
raising the call for the return of @entity35 ’s @entity12 , which ended its run in 1979 , miss @entity1 said : ‘ i find it slightly odd that the excellent @entity39 ( similarly devised by @entity35 ) has survived right through to the present day , while many a slip last appeared on the airwaves the year that @entity42 was elected prime minister , @entity44 died , and president @entity45 was attacked by a killer rabbit			1
i wonder why it died ? ‘ what has happened since 1979 , i suspect , is that the spotting of mistakes has become entirely associated with mean - spiritedness , snobbishness and judgmentalism			1
but if you listen to many a slip , you will find that the spotting of mistakes can be , on the contrary , funny and interesting , and surprisingly easy to join in with			2
‘ besides , no one can argue that the world is now such an easy - going , forgiving sort of place , where no errors are ever drawn attention to			1
it ’s quite the opposite , with social media permanently poised to jump on ( and punish ) the slightest slip - up of behaviour , or judgment , from celebrities			2
’ she added : ‘ i really think they should bring it back			0
it could be wildly popular			0
but who ’d chair it ? who would dare ? ’ many a slip , which aired for 14 years , was a game show that revolved around spotting errors in passages of text			1
they could be contradictions , errors of fact or grammar or repetition			2
and it involved light teasing between the two teams which both entertained and educated listeners			0
miss @entity1 is best known for her book @entity15 : the @entity17 to punctuation reminiscing about the programme @entity94 said : ‘ this was such a gentle game			1
since the mistakes were all intentional , no one was made to look stupid			0
the listeners were not only entertained but gently educated			0
as a teenaged listener , i was in awe at the cleverness of such regular contestants as @entity104 and @entity105			0
‘ they could hear a sentence such as , “ he was mortally wounded so badly that he died ” and buzz in with the objection , “ @entity119 ! ” i mention this because although spotting tautology is n’t the most important of all life skills , i do owe my own awareness of tautology ’s existence entirely to many a slip			2
’ @entity94 ’ other books about punctuation include the girl ’s @entity122 : why , you ca n’t manage without @entity125 ! and @entity126 : why , @entity127 ! , writing in the @entity129 , she said : ‘ the world is full of people who love to spot a mistake			1
not only do they love to spot them , they enjoy pointing them out as well			0
i can say this with such confidence because ever since i wrote my book on grammar , i receive sightings of mistakes virtually every day , some of which are ( unintentionally ) rather brilliant			2
' outside a card shop , for example , it might say : “ spoil your loved one ’s @entity147 14 february ” – when the actual intention was to write : “ spoil your loved ones ! @entity147 , 14 february			0
” ' similarly , there is ( according to legend , anyway ) a sign inside the door to a block of flats somewhere that says : “ residents refuse to go in the bins ”			0
but who can blame those residents for refusing to go in the bins ? if you lived there , i absolutely guarantee you would refuse to go in the bins as well			0
’ on saturday miss @entity1 will introduce her favourite programmes from the @entity166 archive – including many a slip – in a three - hour radio 4 extra broadcast called @entity1 : pick of the archive .			1
