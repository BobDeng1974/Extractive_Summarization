have you ever wondered what you have to do to keep your man 's eye from wandering ? one woman thinks she has the answer - it involves a scalpel and some silicone			1
self - titled sex expert @entity9 is telling women who reach their forties to get plastic surgery or face their partner running off with a younger model			1
@entity9 , who runs a relationship therapy centre in central @entity16 , believes ladies only have themselves to blame if their husband starts to find other women more attractive			1
' they say that their husband is messing about and he ’s left them for someone else , but i think it is absolutely the woman 's responsibility when they have let themselves go over the years			0
' we are the creators of our own destiny , if your fella cheats , you ’ve created it yourself			2
' the men have a right to look elsewhere , they have a right to be sleeping with an attractive woman			0
' apparently it could be worse though , while @entity50 and @entity51 women are not in good shape , @entity9 reserves her harshest criticism for ladies from some of the countries on the @entity58 mainland			1
she said : ' i lived in @entity60 for fifteen years and the women there , they age because they eat all of these cakes and bread			2
' a lot of the women , when they hit 50 they are pretty much a write - off in some of those countries , but it does n’t have to be that way			2
' @entity9 provides advice for women whose men have been unfaithful steering clear of cakes and keeping in shape with regular visits to the gym is not enough though - @entity9 thinks that women should start to have breast augmentation , liposuction , fillers and the rest as soon as parts of the body start to sag			1
she said : ' a lot of my female clients in their forties and fifties come in and they ’re unhappy that their husbands are playing away but they ’ve let themselves go			0
' but no one ’s really happy with themselves when they are overweight and not looking good			0
' even when you buy a new dress you feel good – looking good is feeling good			0
' i actively encourage my clients to get plastic surgery and it ’s received fairly well			1
' i have had the odd client who think they should be accepted for who they are but some of them have taken it up			0
@entity9 believes women should look into cosmetic surgery as soon as their skin start to sag ( picture posed by models ) ' i ’ve had some ladies who have had liposuction done for their weight and some who 've had the gastric band			1
' there are also some who 've had their eyes and breasts done as well			0
' faces get saggy and a little bit of filler is good , it ’s very important that you find the right surgeon though			0
' some of the @entity129 girls go totally over the top and they begin looking like this plastic			2
it does n’t have to be like that			0
' if you have a good surgeon , they ’ll do it the right way			0
' @entity9 claims to have had serious success with her pro-plastic surgery approach to healing marriages			1
but sometimes the effects can be so strong that the balance in the relationship swings completely the other way			2
@entity9 thinks that men should be allowed to look elsewhere if their partner has let themselves go she said : ' this one woman had a boob job and it gave her a totally new lease of life			1
' she decided that as her husband had cheated on her , she was going to go off anyway			0
' i take my hat off to those types of women as well because i think that maybe they had been staying in the relationship because they had settled and could n’t get anyone better			1
' while @entity9 acknowledges that her comments may seem harsh and quite extreme , she is quick to point out that she practises what she preaches and has undergone extensive cosmetic surgery herself			1
she said : ' people say to me it ’s easy because i am a natural beauty but i work really hard to look like this			0
' i decided that in my fortieth year i wanted to be the fittest i ’ve ever been , so i had my boobs done			0
' i first had them done eight years ago , back then i was a @entity172 and went up to a @entity173 and now i ’m a 34 @entity174 ' i also had under my eyes done – i had the wrinkles taken out , i ’ve also had my lips done			0
' everybody says that they ca n’t believe i ’m 40 , they all think that i look like i ’m 30 and that ’s a great feeling			0
' i do n’t believe in growing old gracefully			0
' it seems that @entity9 is n't alone in her desire to stay looking fresh as soon as the big 4 - 0 looms , more and more surgeons are experiencing the an influx of forty - something women checking in for adjustments			1
mr @entity189 , who performed @entity9 's surgery at @entity191 said : ' i have seen a rise in patients wanting to remain younger at a younger age			1
' previously women would have come to see me in their fifties or sixties , i am now seeing more women in their forties			2
the most popular procedures for women of this age are breast uplifts , liposuction and blepharoplasty ( eyelid surgery )			1
' the most popular procedures for women in their forties are breast uplifts , liposuction and blepharoplasty ( eyelid surgery ) there are some who are allowed to grow old gracefully though - men			1
while women should get plastic surgery to hide the signs of ageing , @entity9 believes that men only need to keep in shape by eating well and heading to the gym			1
she said : ' i think men are more fortunate , they age better than women and they become more distinguished			2
' so obviously they need to keep themselves fit , but as far as surgery , they get away with lines and things like that			2
' i do n’t think there is as much emphasis on the men needing to do it			0
