the @entity0 has been forced into an embarrassing climbdown over climate change claims made in sir @entity5 's groundbreaking @entity4 series			1
in the last episode of the series , entitled ' future ' , sir @entity5 discussed the challenges facing the region			2
speaking over footage of @entity12 , sir @entity5 made the assertion that ' some parts of the continent have become 3.5c hotter in the past 20 years '			1
however , this report suggested the figure had come from a report by @entity33			1
the 2006 @entity34 , entitled ' the climate of poverty ' says the data came from a ' conversation with authors ; february 2006			2
' the @entity0 says the mistake was made by researchers , and not the presenter			1
however , figures from the @entity44 show that since 1850 global temperatures have risen by @entity46 , causing widespread concern among viewers			1
the comment , first broadcast in the final episode of the @entity4 series last wednesday , was removed from sunday night ’s repeat of the show			1
a @entity0 spokesman said : ' there is widespread acknowledgement within the scientific community that the climate of @entity4 has been changing as stated in the programme			1
' we accept the evidence for 3.5 degrees increase is disputable and the commentary should have reflected that			2
' therefore that line has been removed from sunday 's repeat and the iplayer version replaced			1
' many took to @entity69 to dispute the fact , asking where the data came from			1
the @entity0 initially defended the claim , saying it was taken from a report by @entity28 and the @entity29 , but in turn this report suggested the figure had come from a report by @entity33			1
this report however , says the data came from a ' conversation with authors ; february 2006 , ' and the report 's authors have not responded to question over its validity			0
experts have also questioned the figure , with dr @entity90 of the @entity92 's @entity91 telling the @entity93 : so i would say that our data do not support the claim of 3.5 degc warming in the last 20 years in some regions of @entity4			1
' sir @entity5 with a three month old rhino during the filming of the show the 1996 @entity33 report which contained the claim - which the @entity0 has now removed from the show a @entity0 source told @entity107 that the mistake was made by the production team and not by sir @entity5 , who told them he did not know how it ended up in the script			1
the six - week wildlife series showed stunning footage of life on the continent			1
' the mistake was being so specific			0
' it should have been more carefully scripted , ' the source said			0
in 2006 , sir @entity5 admitted that he used to be a sceptic but now believed it is one of the major challenged facing the world			1
' i was sceptical about climate change , ' he said			0
' i think conservationists have to be careful in saying things are catastrophic when , in fact , they are less than catastrophic			0
' but i ’m no longer sceptical			0
' now i do not have any doubt at all			0
' i think climate change is the major challenge facing the world			1
' i have waited until the proof was conclusive that it was humanity changing the climate			0
' in the final episode of @entity4 he also focused on the threat of the growing population , with farmland expanding at the expense of wildlife			0
later in the episode , sir @entity5 said @entity4 was ' the world ’s hottest continent and there is no doubt it ’s getting warmer '			1
he also said that 80 per cent of the permanent icefields at the summit of @entity12 , @entity148 , had disappeared and ' soon it will be free of ice altogether '			0
the show had previously come under fire for accusations that its @entity4 series manipulated viewers by exaggerating ' emotional ' scenes from nature			1
global average temperature since 1880.this graph from @entity160 shows the annual trend in average global air temperature in degrees @entity163 , through december 2012			2
for each year , the range of uncertainty is indicated by the gray vertical bars			0
the blue line tracks the changes in the trend over time			0
sir @entity5 's latest venture left many animal - lovers in tears , with scenes including one in which a mother elephant appeared to leave her herd to mourn over her dying calf			2
in the same episode , a mother shoebill was shown feeding and watering only her stronger chick , leaving the other to die of malnutrition			2
one viewer wrote on @entity69 : ' that poor baby elephant and the poor mother having to watch her baby die ! # tears had to stop eating my dinner			1
@entity0 # @entity4 warn me next time			1
' another added : ' how heartbreaking watching the baby elephant calf die and the mother can only walk away			0
i 'm in tears here			0
' of a scene featuring rhinoceroses , another viewer said : ' @entity200 meeting down the local watering hole for a quick snog , we 're all the same really , amazing			0
' the show 's creators were also accused of using using music to create an emotional narrative			2
but producer @entity207 insisted that the six - part series reflected the ' breadth of what happens in nature			2
' heartbreaking : a scene in which an elephant appears to grieve over her dying calf was distressing for many viewers he told @entity218 's @entity219 : ' i do n't think we do tell you what to feel , but we do lay open the broad pallet of what is happening in nature - and some of it is joyous and some of it is tough to watch			1
' the corporation received 16 complaints about the background music and 16 about the elephant calf 's death			0
' we are obviously concerned that some viewers have been upset , ' said mr @entity207			2
' as soon as you look at an animal not as a species but as an individual , you do get drawn in and your empathy for that individual character will increase			0
' it is part of the process of looking deeper and creating that more immersive experience			0
' he denied that the programme ’s score ' told viewers how to feel ' at different points			2
' we ’ve always used music in our films , ' he said			0
' the music tends to reflect what is happening in the film , so if we ’re telling an intimate story then the music will indeed be intimate too			0

broadcaster removed assertions that ' some parts of the continent have become 3.5c hotter in the past 20 years ' in repeat shown last night
figures show that since 1850 global temperatures have risen by @entity46 , causing widespread concern among viewers .
