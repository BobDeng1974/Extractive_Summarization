@entity0 climbed to fifth place in the @entity3 standings after beating bottom club @entity4 26 - 5 at the @entity5			1
the @entity0 took an age to quell the spirited @entity4 , who kept the visitors to a 5 - 5 score line after 35 minutes before @entity0 's forward power told after the interval			1
@entity12 scored two tries for the visitors , @entity15 and replacement @entity16 the others with @entity18 kicking three conversions			0
@entity18 had taken over the kicking from @entity21 , who had a poor match , missing all three kicks and taking a number of wrong options before being substituted			0
@entity26 breaks through a @entity4 tackle as @entity0 showed enough strength to win @entity4 , buoyed by an impressive effort from their new recruit , number eight @entity29 , gave a much improved show with their defence considerably toughened after conceding more than 70 points at @entity34			1
however they did suffer a major blow when @entity29 was helped off late in the second half			1
@entity0 gave @entity18 a @entity3 debut at full - back whilst wing @entity40 was selected for his first @entity3 start of the season			1
the pack was unchanged from last week 's home draw with @entity45 but @entity21 returned at fly - half			0
@entity4 were without forwards @entity47 and @entity49 who were both injured in last weekend 's crushing defeat at @entity34			1
@entity51 and @entity29 were their replacements with veteran @entity53 selected at outside half in place of @entity56			1
@entity57 goes on the attack as @entity4 put in a much - improved display at the @entity5 @entity53 began with a careless error , kicking the ball straight into touch to concede a line - out in the home 22			1
@entity65 were then penalised but the @entity0 elected an attacking line - out before a knock - on enabled the hosts to clear the danger			2
@entity21 had the game 's first chance for points but his long range penalty sailed wide as @entity0 made a whole host of mistakes in the first 15 minutes			1
@entity4 were unable to get out of their half in the opening quarter but another missed penalty from @entity21 ensured that the match remained scoreless after 20 minutes			2
the errors continued in abundance with @entity21 ' charged down kick the latest , which gave @entity4 their first chance of points but @entity84 's drop goal attempt went wide			2
however , @entity4 surprisingly took the lead with @entity57 being the catalyst for the score			2
the full back first retrieved his high kick ahead and when the ball was recycled , skilfully placed a cross-field kick directly into the path of @entity92 , who easily collected for the try			0
@entity15 dives over the line as the @entity0 pack began to dominate in the second half after the two misses from @entity21 , @entity0 opted for an attacking line - out after being awarded another penalty			2
this time it paid dividends with @entity12 crashing over for the try with @entity21 again off target with the kick			0
@entity4 nearly regained the lead when @entity105 charged down a clearance kick and looked set to score , only for @entity21 to race back and narrowly beat the flanker to the touchdown			0
however , back came @entity0 to secure another attacking line - out for @entity12 to score his second			0
@entity18 took over the kicking duties and succeeded from the touchline to give @entity0 a 12 - 5 interval lead			0
@entity18 took over the kicking responsibilities after @entity21 had missed his first three efforts @entity0 dominated the opening period of the second half and deservedly went further ahead when @entity15 brushed aside two tacklers to score for @entity18 to convert			0
with 20 minutes remaining , @entity21 was replaced by @entity119 and he was in time to see @entity16 finish off another line - out drive for the bonus point try			0
@entity4 lost @entity29 through injury after he had attempted to force his way over before a thoroughly disappointing game meandered to a tame conclusion .			1

bottom side @entity4 have lost every game so far this season
welsh *inspired* by new *signing* @entity29 to put in much better display
but @entity0 show enough power to win relatively *comfortably*
