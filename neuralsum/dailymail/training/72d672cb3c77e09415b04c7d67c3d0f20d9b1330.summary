@entity0 must be kicking themselves after @entity2 defender @entity1 revealed that he chose not to join the club in 2011 due to their purchase of @entity5			1
but @entity0 are not the first club to miss out on a big star due to a combination of bad luck and poor judgement			1
sir @entity11 was responsible for bringing in @entity5 and not varane but at least he was n't the manager who passed up on @entity13 in favour of , er , @entity15			1
read on for more details about that particular gaffe and other ones who got away in @entity22 football 's biggest transfer misses			1
1 @entity24 - @entity23 , 1966 the man hailed as @entity24 by the @entity26 could have been handed the same epithet by the @entity28 instead had things turned out differently			2
legend has it that @entity23 boss @entity32 thought @entity24 was too lightweight and so turned down the chance to sign the 15 - year - old striker , but @entity35 suggests in his new book , a man walks on to a pitch , that @entity24 was always destined for @entity40			2
@entity24 went on to become both @entity41 and @entity43 's greatest player			2
@entity45 's name is still sung at @entity46 many years after he finished playing for @entity41 2 @entity13 - @entity47 , 1978 @entity0 boss @entity48 spotted a 17 - year - old @entity13 on a scouting trip to @entity50 and was so impressed that he struck a £ 200,000 deal there and then			1
but when @entity55 demanded more cash the @entity54 board refused to cough up , and bought @entity13 's countryman @entity15 instead			1
@entity15 spent two years at @entity58 and went on to coach @entity50 to last summer 's @entity60 final			2
@entity13 inspired his side to win the trophy in 1986 and is perhaps the greatest footballer ever to live			1
@entity13 is held aloft after @entity50 defeated @entity65 3 - 2 in the @entity60 final in 1986 3 @entity68 - @entity67 wednesday , 1991 ' @entity69 ' - not just the sound of @entity0 fans singing @entity68 's praises but probably also the mumbled response of @entity74 when asked why he did n't sign @entity68 when he had the chance			1
@entity68 was up for grabs after an epic tantrum at @entity78 ( when he threw a ball at a ref and called in turn each member of the @entity85 @entity84 's disciplinary team an idiot ) and went on trial at wednesday after threatening to retire from the game			2
after a week of training indoors due to bad weather , @entity74 was somehow still not convinced and asked the striker to stay on for a further week to play on grass			2
@entity68 refused and was snapped up by @entity93			2
he joined @entity0 a year later and became the first true star of the @entity96 era ( and the player who consequently transformed @entity99 football for two decades )			1
@entity68 scores for @entity0 against local rivals @entity100 in 1993 4 @entity101 - @entity0 , 1992 the @entity96 's all - time record goalscorer could have ensured near total dominance for the top - flight 's most successful club had he moved to @entity106 from @entity107 in 1992			1
instead , @entity101 chose to join @entity108 because @entity0 ' took too long ' to seal the deal , which had been lined up			1
@entity101 helped @entity110 to the title in 1995 and became a thorn in their side for years as a world - class striker			2
@entity101 is the deadliest marksman in @entity96 history , with a signature goal celebration 5 @entity118 - @entity23 , 1995 this one is best told in @entity35 's own words : ' i was at @entity23 and @entity122 and i were approached by these two villains who said they were doing some business in the @entity125 , and we were so scared of them we agreed to have a look at a couple of these kids			0
' one of them we played against @entity131 and he scored the winner			0
they said they wanted a million quid for him , and @entity122 said it was too much — well i ’m blaming @entity122 — and we let him go			0
his name was @entity118 ! ' @entity118 enjoyed a brilliant career at @entity141 ... after failing to land a deal at @entity23 6 @entity143 - @entity108 , 1995 when offered the chance to sign @entity143 , what might you say ? probably not ' no thanks - we 've got @entity149 '			0
unfortunately that is roughly what the late @entity151 , then @entity108 owner , said when he had the opportunity to bring the greatest player of his generation to @entity156			0
instead , @entity143 left @entity157 for @entity158 a year later and went on to become a legend in @entity160 and then an original @entity161 at @entity2			0
@entity143 holds up the @entity60 after inspiring @entity162 to victory at at the @entity162 in 1998 7 @entity164 – @entity165 , 2000 not many 16 - year - olds would turn down the chance to have a trial at @entity165 but @entity164 was never your average player			0
' @entity171 ( @entity172 ) gave me the famous red and white jersey - the no 9 shirt with @entity164 on it and i was so pleased i even posed for a picture wearing it , ' he said			0
' he never actually made me a serious offer , it was more , " i want to see how good you are , what kind of player you are			0
' i could n't believe it			0
i was like , " no way , @entity164 does n't do auditions "			0
fourteen years later , @entity164 has won titles at @entity186 , @entity158 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity141 and @entity189 , and is @entity191 's greatest ever player			0
@entity164 wearing his @entity165 shirt ( left ) and celebrating a goal against the @entity194 in 2010 ( right ) 8 @entity196 - @entity195 , 2001 yes , you read right			0
just before moving to @entity189 , @entity196 was lined up for a short spell at the @entity200 outfit , with his advisers insisting that he could do with a stint in @entity203 to acclimatise to the style of football on the continent			0
unfortunately for the @entity208 red tape scuppered the move			0
@entity196 , perhaps employing selective memory , said a few years later of the @entity195 move : ' i had a lot of offers from @entity203			0
i ca n't remember where they were all from			0
' @entity196 was the most skilful forward in the world at @entity188 in the early part of the 21st century 9 @entity219 - @entity165 , 2003 @entity164 was n't the only player to have been seduced by an @entity165 shirt with their name and the no 9 on the back			1
sadly for @entity172 , the tactic failed with @entity219 too			1
the £ 80m @entity2 superstar did what @entity164 would never do and took up a week 's trial with the @entity194 , but @entity172 was gazumped by @entity0 , who used @entity231 to appeal to the @entity233 starlet			1
oh well , @entity171 - at least you did n't miss out on @entity235 ... @entity219 almost moved to @entity165 before @entity0 stepped in and lured him away 10 @entity235 - @entity165 , 2003 ah			1
yes , unfortunately @entity172 did also miss out on @entity235 , meaning the two greatest players on the planet both slipped through the @entity165 boss 's fingertips			1
@entity172 came within a whisker of signing @entity235 from @entity188 ’s @entity243 academy when he was just 16 , along with @entity244 and @entity245 , promising the @entity188 trio first - team football			1
@entity235 was , remarkably , interested in moving to north @entity248 , but the deal was ruined because of issues over the @entity50 forward ’s work permit			2
and the rest , as they say , is history			0
@entity235 ( centre ) almost made a shock move to @entity165 from @entity188 as a teenager and here 's how they could have looked ( sort of ) ... @entity13 in a @entity47 kit , @entity143 in the @entity108 jersey , @entity219 in an @entity165 shirt @entity264 open to @entity219 return			1

@entity1 revealed he rejected @entity0 in 2011
@entity1 said he did so because @entity0 had signed @entity5
other @entity22 clubs have missed out on big stars in the transfer market
