by @entity0 an @entity2 wife and mother is facing felony theft charges after duping her entire town into believing she had terminal intestinal cancer			1
police say @entity8 , 35 , of @entity9 , managed to bilk friends , family , neighbors and old college chums out of over $ 20,000 while even her husband was convinced his wife was fighting for her life			1
and she managed to milk it further by putting on a brave face			0
not only did she play the part of the dying mother , but she had everyone in awe of her strength of will throughout what they believed to be an horrific ordeal			1
doing alright : @entity2 mother @entity8 , 35 , allegedly duped most of the town of @entity9 and even a town a state away in @entity31 that she was dying from intestinal cancer outrageous : two charitable giving sites sprung up for @entity8 , created by concerned friends , family and even strangers who called themselves @entity37			1
this one raised $ 13,234 of a $ 30,000 goal to offset her ' medical expenses ' according to the @entity41 , @entity8 had a long history of illnesses			1
she claimed to suffer from heart disease , strokes and lupus from a young age			0
specialists across the country were unable to figure out just how and why she suffered so many health problems			0
when things seemed to become even worse sometime in late 2013 or early 2014 , her friends , family and neighbors rallied around her			2
she had intestinal cancer , she said , and was fearing for the worst			0
but @entity8 put on a brave face and became an admired figure in her central @entity2 town			1
she began to post her day to day struggles to a fundraising blog as donations began to pour in from people who called themselves @entity37			2
friends even organized a charity run and purchased t - shirts to support her and her family			2
in deep : @entity67 and friends rallied around the 35 - year - old mother and even organized and fundraiser run to benefit her , her 7 - year - old daughter and her husband bizarre : even @entity8 's husband believed his wife could soon die of intestinal cancer that seemed to have moved to her liver ' # mindysarmy is n’t just about me , ' she wrote in a seemingly humble february 16 post			1
' it ’s about anyone that is fighting with an illness or cancer or a hard time , so try to remember that as you look down and see your wrist			0
stay positive and always try to do the next right thing ! ' those wrists were adorned in @entity91 style bracelets , only they were for @entity37			0
a day after her face appeared on the february 24 cover of a local newspaper with a headline touting her @entity8 's ' friends , @entity67 and @entity99 ' she posted this : ' i so appreciate everyone ... the texts to keep me awake , the prayers , the support , the ongoing financial contributions are all appreciated so much			2
' everyone she knew thought she was going to die , including her husband and her mother , who raised $ 7,000 for her treatment a state away in her @entity31 town			1
someone who saw @entity8 on the newspaper cover had doubts , and voiced them in a call to the police			1
' it ’s a lie , ' said the tipster			0
' you should check it out			0
' and when police did just that , they discovered it really was a lie			0
@entity8 had raised at least $ 20,000 from towns in two different states while keeping everyone except her 7 - year - old little girl in a state of fear she could die anytime			1
@entity8 was arrested and charged with felony theft			2
considerate : only @entity8 's 7 - year - old daughter was spared the terrible news that her mother was dying but @entity139 prosecutor @entity138 believes the scheme was more for the attention than for the money and some of @entity8 's illnesses may have , in fact , been real			1
the @entity41 reports that the former @entity9 schools employee left her job in 2012 and has been collecting social security ever since			2
and the @entity148 reports that she may have a history of heart trouble			0
@entity8 has now applied for what 's called a diversion , which will clear her of the felony charge if she pays back the $ 20,000 - plus sum she bilked from concerned loved ones			1
@entity8 's attorney @entity157 said she 's already returned much of the cash			0
he also said he believes @entity8 's real physical illness will make itself known soon , whether or not it 's the terminal cancer she once claimed to have			2
' there ’s been a significant change in her physical appearance , ' he told the @entity41			0
' there ’s something going on			0
' ' it 's a lie ' : a february 24 local newspaper cover featuring @entity8 became her undoing			0
a reader called a tip into @entity9 police , who investigated and found that @entity8 never had cancer at all			1

@entity8 , 35 , of @entity9 , @entity2 convinced her friends , neighbors , college buddies , *co-workers* and even her husband that she had cancer
the mother of a 7 - year - old girl was given over $ 20,000 in donations from concerned loved ones and strangers as her family believed she was dying
a tipster ended the charade with a call to police after a front - page story ran about what people thought was her *incredible* strength
