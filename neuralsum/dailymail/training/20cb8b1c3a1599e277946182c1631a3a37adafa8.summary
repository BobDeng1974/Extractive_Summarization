not so long ago the very presence of a father in the delivery room was virtually unheard of , with dads - to - be pacing maternity unit corridors while midwives patiently guided a woman through the most gruelling — and joyous — moment of her life			2
now fathers are expected to play an integral role			0
there can not be a woman in the world whose deepest sympathies did not go out to mrs @entity41 , aka @entity42 , as the singer filmed her during her most private moments			0
we even saw her in red spangly @entity48 stilettos while her legs were in stirrups			0
most husbands would be happy to let their labouring partners relax in a pair of comfy old slippers and a flannel night - gown			1
not so @entity21 , who seemed to be telling the world that @entity23 was a sex object for his delectation , even while giving birth			1
then we were forced to watch the pain of her contractions			0
hard to stomach ? yes			0
but perhaps most bewildering was the way in which @entity21 turned the birth of his own baby into a series of clips — one showed the 40 - year - old former @entity70 star doing a lengthy dance routine at his wife ’s bedside — in which there was , very clearly , only one star			1
and that certainly was n’t @entity23			2
@entity23 plays along by twerking in the birthing suite but it 's not long before she looks like she 's in agony let ’s be clear			1
i ’ve no doubt at all that @entity21 loves his wife to bits			1
as @entity86 wrote in the @entity87 yesterday , he is ‘ clearly , deliriously in love ’			2
but while his videos are no doubt intended to be affectionate , fun and tongue in cheek , there was no escaping the person they were intended to promote			0
while it might be comedy , it was also vanity			0
in an age when it seems a week does not go by without celebrities revealing their most private moments on social media , @entity21 appears to have trumped them all			2
‘ will it get on my gown ? ’ @entity21 quips as his long - suffering wife begins to give birth to their second child after all , if the entry of a new life into the world is not sancrosanct , what is ? even those celebrities who have sold media rights to their weddings , or shared the most intimate confessions about their sex lives , must have cringed watching these videos — and hopefully seen how out of control self - revelation has become			1
to start with , @entity23 ’s contractions are mild enough for the 35 - year - old actress to play along with his weak jokes			1
in the first clip , he sits uninterestedly staring at his laptop while she sets an inappropriately sexy tone with a half - hearted lap dance			2
she attempts to catch his attention by leaning over at 45 degrees to do a @entity130 - style ‘ twerk ’ — not easy with a substantial baby bump			1
he dances , she suffers in agony as she goes into labour ‘ he is loving it			1
that computer is just hiding his erection , ’ @entity23 says , managing in one sentence to go along with her husband ’s reduction of the birthing experience to ‘ entertainment ’ at its most lewd and crass			1
another clip shows the singer limping along a hospital corridor with a drip as his wife follows			2
after that , we see him chirpily inform viewers who are ‘ really concerned and worried and thinking about what ’s going on ’ that he , @entity21 , is doing great			1
the bizarre videos , shot in a @entity157 hospital , were interspersed with @entity21 ’ witterings on @entity29 , such as , ‘ it ’s ok , i ’ve totally got this ’ alongside a picture of him at his wife ’s bedside , pulling his best boy - band grin , even while @entity23 was clearly in pain and distress			1
but worse was to come			0
the next clip showed @entity23 grimacing and puffing before her face disappears and all we can see is a pair of legs in the air as a doctor ducks down to check on the delivery then tells her to ‘ push ’			1
is @entity21 holding his wife ’s hand ? no. he is singing the hit frozen theme tune @entity181			1
even long - suffering @entity23 tells him to shut up			1
the only thing we did not witness in the creation of this new life , it seems , was the moment of conception itself			0
and perhaps the most bewildering thing of all ? the uber - showman did n’t give his fans their obvious finale ; we never get to see even a picture of his 8lb 2oz son			0
of course , discretion about even the most private sexual matters seems impossible for many celebs these days			0
@entity200 has told us she has waxed her nether regions so much she now needs a pubic wig for some film scenes			1
@entity205 revealed he uses @entity206 , and in her album released this summer , @entity204 sang about her husband @entity208 ’s unparalleled ability to delay sexual climax			1
@entity21 rather too candidly revealed that he and @entity23 were ‘ practising ’ for a second child following the birth of their first , @entity214 , in 2012			1
conversations better kept private are now also broadcast over @entity29			0
the pair joke as @entity23 shows off her louboutins in the hospital tv presenter @entity220 could have sent @entity221 private texts at the start of their relationship			1
instead she announced over @entity29 to him — and around 140,000 followers — ‘ i ’ve got the raging horn , please take me			0
’ in a society where celebrities are now partly judged on the size of their @entity29 following , they seem to feel the need to shout louder and break new boundaries			0
how depressing that the famous — and those who imitate them — are increasingly stuck in the developmental fishbowl of a four - year - old , with that ‘ @entity243 ! ’ desire to be centre of attention at all times			1
the irony of @entity21 ’s pregnancy video is that in august he took to @entity29 to complain that pictures had appeared in a @entity248 magazine of him playing at the seaside with his older child , @entity214			1
@entity21 said he felt ‘ sick and violated ’			1
he still re-tweeted the magazine page to his 2.35 million followers			0
it does n’t appear to occur to @entity21 that he is personally invading his wife ’s privacy by filming her			2
while no doubt at the start she ’s capable of giving her permission , by the end she appears helpless and drugged up			0
@entity261 is the moment at which a woman is at the most vulnerable she will ever be			0
yet instead of reassuring his wife , the former @entity70 singer simply tunes out her moans by turning up the volume on a succession of cheesy ballads			0
at one point , @entity23 throws her head back in distress , with a look that says the only show she wants her husband to put on is a disappearing act			2
but @entity21 is too busy miming and dancing to one of his hits to notice			2
dismayed she is concentrating on her contractions rather than him , he taps her on the arm			0
finding himself ignored again , he tells whoever is filming the scene to stop , before flouncing off			0
is he joking around ? well			0
not even the two people on the chairs behind him , presumably relatives , look vaguely amused			0
never mind the little life waiting to emerge — it ’s clear the biggest baby in this room is @entity21 himself			2
the pair looking slightly more demure as the birth draws closer , we see @entity21 making a show of helping his wife , by holding a gas - and - air mask over her face to help her control the pain			1
the only surprise here is that the star does n’t take a sniff of the gas himself			0
it might have been helpful to calm him down			0
the grisly denouement comes when a genuinely scared - looking @entity23 , by now naked below the waist , covers her eyes with her hands as a doctor tells her he is going to have to break her waters with the gynaecological equivalent to a crochet hook — and announces it will be messy			2
@entity21 exits stage right with the quip : ‘ will any of it go over my gown ? ’ it seems the star has not grown up at all since describing the birth of his daughter @entity214 in 2012 as like ‘ the first 30 minutes of @entity325 ’			1
it might be easy to dismiss @entity21 ’ antics as the efforts of a limelight - hogging star to garner some publicity			1
while he remains a much - loved entertainer around the world , @entity21 is not quite the mega-star he once was , in the @entity335 anyway			2
but his social media posts are an extreme example of a disturbing trend to reduce life ’s most intimate moments to nothing more than a cheap reality show			0
we ’re turning into a nation of narcissists and voyeurs			0
this year we have already seen marketing executive @entity347 , 34 , from @entity348 , commentating on the birth of her child live on @entity29			2
then @entity351 , who sparked huge condemnation for getting a breast operation on the @entity354 , sold tickets to the birth of her baby for over £ 10,000 each			0
so far the reaction to @entity21 ’s video has been decidedly mixed , with some fans saying they love the singer ’s openness — while others argued he had only cemented his reputation as an attention - obsessed narcissist			2
but that wo n’t worry @entity21 , who announces in the final clip after the birth : ‘ no moms were harmed during the making of any of these videos			1
’ @entity23 sits blithely next to him , smiling again and looking understandably relieved it ’s all over , adding she is still under the influence of the pain - relieving drugs			1
once she has time to reflect on the experience of bringing her second child into the world , it remains to be seen whether she will continue to agree with him .			0
