as @entity0 draws to a close many style - watchers will be compiling a list of trends they want to try			1
although many of the outfits may be a little too outlandish for most of us , one way to attempt a catwalk look is by adopting the hair or beauty trends			1
aside from being more affordable than rebooting your entire wardrobe , it is also an easy way to wear catwalk styles without waiting for the collections to filter into high street stores			1
hairdresser to the stars @entity21 shows you how to recreate the hair scene on the @entity0 catwalk hairdresser @entity21 , who counts @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity28 model @entity27 and @entity29 among his clients , says that this season has seen a plethora of both classic hair looks as well as new trends worth trying			1
' at the beginning of every new season , fashion month tells an intricate story of new ideas , concepts and looks intertwined with a glimpse of some firm favourites			0
' @entity0 has not failed to disappoint , showcasing the very best of the design elite , we have seen some beautiful shows from where this seasons new and eclectic trends will emerge from ' here he shares some of his top looks from the capital 's most fashionable week and tells you how you can achieve them			1
waves and woodstock texture and movement played a big part this season			0
both @entity61 and @entity62 used texture to create very different looks for the shows			1
@entity61 created a @entity67 - inspired look – a matte , windswept style			1
a messy side parting was teamed with a scrunched in , blown out look			0
simple to recreate , all this look needs is slightly damp hair , a handful of @entity75 , £ 17.00 , a light weight , long lasting foam that instantly lifts and adds volume even to fine and fragile hair			1
@entity61 created a highland inspired style ( left ) and @entity62 saw @entity83 style tresses ( right ) scrunch in to hair with an upwards movement – flip head upside down and blast with a hair dryer to set the natural movement in the hair			1
for those with fine , straight hair , use a curling tong in big sections to create a bend in the hair , then once the section of hair has been released , pull the ends of the section outwards to straighten out a curl that is too pronounced			1
shake out hair with fingers and mist over hair with @entity109 hair @entity107 ( £ 9.49 boots ) for a gritty matte finish			1
to recreate the @entity113 half ponytail , a bohemian look perfect for everyday hair , simply set hair in to a centre parting and gently backcomb at the crown			1
gather the top section into a loose half ponytail and simply pin in place by crossing over two @entity123 grips or a snag - free band			1
this will create a face framing halo of hair that looks practically angelic			2
a quick mist of firm hold hair spray is all it will take to keep this style in place all day			2
@entity133 relaxed , low slung hair was seen on the catwalk at @entity136 relaxed , low slung hair was the order of the week this season , @entity137 and @entity136 embraced the nape of the neck by creating styles that were as low as you can go			1
the low slung ponytails had flattering volume at the crown that framed the face from the front , giving a cheeky rear detail			0
recreate the undone pony from @entity137 , by creating smooth , glossy and healthy hair with a touch of movement			2
part hair in the centre , apply @entity157 , £ 18 , to the palms of your hands , rub hands together and smooth through the ends of the hair to take away any frizz			2
the @entity165 contains grape seed extract to help tame and instantly nourish dry , frizzy , uncontrollable hair and smooth unruly flyaways			2
gather hair in to a loose pony at the nape of the neck using a snag - free band , tie your ponytail but making sure the band is halfway down the hair shaft			1
when you get to the final tie , do n't pull the hair all the way through but create a loop with the ends of the hair			2
pull a few loose messy face framing strands at the front create a different take on this trend by simply wrapping a scarf around your neck and over your hair - secure at the front , then pull hair out a little so it creates a faux bob			1
top tip : always use a treatment once a week for the healthiest hair possible but remember to use it after shampoo but before conditioner			2
shampoo works to rough up the cuticles , removing any dirt from the hair shaft , this then makes the perfect absorbing environment for the masque to penetrate the cuticle to repair and nourish from within			2
the conditioner then works to shut the cuticle back down again , locking in the goodness leaving the cuticle flat and shining with health			0
the @entity212 ( £ 19 , @entity213 ) is a rejuvenating and anti-ageing cellular treatment containing powerful plant stem cells to protect and improve the hair 's health , strength and thickness - and a great quick fix for hair that needs a little bit of love			1
current buns and pony hybrids @entity226 brought back the messy bun coupled with a @entity229 vibe			0
the hair was pulled back as tight as can be , and glossed over with a wet - look gel			1
to get this look keep the pulled back hair as flat as possible then fix in to a mid pony between the crown and the nape of the neck			2
buns and ponytails got a reinvention at @entity241 ( left ) and @entity242 ( right ) backcomb the pony to create volume and smooth over the top with a soft bristled brush to polish out the backcomb on the surface			0
wrap the hair around the base of the pony , pinning as you go			2
instead of pinning in the end section , leave it to hang below to create a hybrid bun and pony			0
@entity242 also showcased a similar bun , positioned lower down with a bit more texture			0
to recreate use a texturizing dust on the ponytail and rubbing it into the hair using the palms of the hands , this will create a matt effect with lots more volume before wrapping in to a bun			2
top tip : when styling a heavy pronounced centre parting , do bear in mind that a lot of scalp will be on show ! make sure you treat your scalp as you would the skin on your face by lavishing it with lots of tlc			0
take your haircare cue from skincare by remembering to exfoliate and moisturise			0
try the @entity287 scalp scrub £ 15.00 , a pre-shampoo scalp treatment containing powerful exfoliants to lift and remove old skin cells for a visibly smoother and clearer scalp			0
then moisturise with a slick of @entity294 intentsive masque £ 17.00			0
an intensive , scalp purifying treatment with ultra-hydrating compounds to restore optimum moisture levels , leaving hair instantly radiating health			0
@entity300 and @entity302 - back sides this season @entity303 paid homage to the @entity305 with big roller disco inspired hair			1
heavily gelled flat centre parting mixed with big fluffed out frizzy waves can be made more wearable by diffusing the look into teased out curls at the sides			0
for thick hair , always curl hair the day after washing so it has a little less slip			0
mist a heat - protecting spray all over hair such as @entity319 ( £ 16 ) which contains a powerful antioxidant complex that binds to the hair 's surface for advanced protection			1
@entity303 paid homage to the 70s crimp ( left ) and @entity325 incorporated a wetlook style this protective , conditioning spray prevents damage caused by heated appliances whilst using vitamin e antioxidants and state - of - the - art uv filter systems for protection against daily environmental stress			0
then start to tong two - inch sections with a large - barrel curling iron to create lazy waves			0
roll each curl up on your finger and pin to the root - continue all over and mist over with hairspray let the curls cool and remove the pins - then brush through lightly with your fingers			0
top tip : sleep with hair in one or two plaits depending on how thick your hair is			0
the next morning you will wake up with instant textured waves - the perfect foundation for tonging and back - combing into mussed up waves the @entity325 show incorporated a wet - look at the sides by slicking back the sides of each girl 's hair with handfuls of hair gel			1
recreate a softer version of this look to cheat out the second or third day hair with no time for a hair wash			0
disguise oily roots with this quick get out of bed fix , simply slick through some gel through the top and side sections sections of hair			0
then roughly pin up the sides criss - crossing the @entity123 grips to anchor the hair - this will create a faux hawk shape half up style !			1
