a landlord has won a planning battle against officials to keep a large unauthorised extension which will include a sauna for his student tenants			1
@entity6 was ordered to tear down the front and back additions to the terraced house in @entity10 , @entity11 , because he had them built without planning permission			1
however after a legal wrangle council planners have decided he can keep the extensions , with the number of bedrooms cut from eight to six and , bizarrely , permission for the two rooms to be used as a sauna and laundry room			1
council planners said ' times had changed ' and it was now not unusual to have a sauna in a student property , but neighbours have complained a number of times about the development			1
@entity30 complained about an unauthorised extension next door at a student house in @entity10 which has just been given planning permission by the council - including for a room to be used as a sauna the council launched enforcement action against mr @entity6 last year after it discovered the extension had been built without permission			1
@entity10 has been the subject of a growing number of complaints about extensions because the area has become popular with student landlords eager to convert family homes to have as many bedrooms as possible			1
@entity30 , who lives next door to the property , said the construction had made his family 's life a nightmare for the past year			0
he said there had been building disturbance , water damage to his house from poor drainage , and having to battle the plans at every turn			2
' it 's caused no end of trouble , ' he said			0
@entity66 ' spokesman @entity65 added : ' we are not talking about a naive first time landlord , but a man with a property portfolio in the area			0
' @entity6 won the planning battle to keep the large extension which was built at the front and back permission has been granted for a sauna to be installed at the six bedroom student house in @entity11 a retrospective planning application was rejected by officials in august and was upheld on appeal			1
it was classified as an ' unneighbourly form of development			0
' but chief planning officer @entity84 stuck up for mr @entity6 , who was not present at the meeting			2
mr @entity84 said he had been given bad advice by a previous planning agent and the new application was acceptable			0
asked about the sauna , mr @entity84 said : ' i am told it is not uncommon to have a sauna in this type of student property			2
' ' times have changed , ' said committee chairman @entity97 @entity96			0
however @entity97 @entity99 said the enforcement should have been upheld			0
he said : ' at some point we are going to have to send in a @entity103 , as much as a warning to any other landlords			0
