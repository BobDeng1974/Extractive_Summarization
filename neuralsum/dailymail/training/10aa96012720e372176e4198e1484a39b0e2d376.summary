by @entity0 published : 16:04 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 16:19 est , 3 march 2014 researchers have revealed a fascinating glimpse of how the world could have looked - if a shift in the @entity7 's tectonic plates had taken a slightly different turn			2
@entity10 researchers say the break - up of the supercontinent @entity12 about 130 million years ago could have lead to a completely different shape of the @entity16 and @entity17 continent			1
they say the move would have left a huge ocean south of today ’s @entity21 desert , creating a @entity22 and a @entity23			0
how @entity17 could have ruled the world : new image shows how the @entity7 might have looked if @entity26 had been split in two			2
the move would have left a huge ocean south of today ¿ s @entity21 desert , creating a @entity22 and a @entity23			0
for hundreds of millions of years , the southern continents of @entity17 , @entity26 , @entity31 , @entity10 , and @entity32 were united in the supercontinent @entity12			1
while the causes for @entity12 's fragmentation are still debated , it is clear that the supercontinent first split along along the @entity16 coast in a western and eastern part before separation of @entity17 from @entity26 took place			1
today 's continental margins along the @entity22 and the subsurface graben structure of the @entity43 in the @entity16 continent , extending from @entity45 northwards to @entity46 , provide key insights on the processes that shaped present - day @entity26 and @entity17			1
geoscientists from the @entity50 and the @entity51 used sophisticated plate tectonic and three - dimensional numerical modelling to recreate the shift - but with a different twist			0
the researchers say the shift that left @entity26 it its present location was almost very different			0
' extension along the @entity22 and @entity61 rift systems was about to split the @entity16 - @entity17 part of @entity63 into nearly equal halves , generating a @entity22 and a @entity23 ' , geoscientist @entity58 said			2
' in a dramatic plate tectonic twist , however , a competing rift along the present - day @entity67 @entity22 margins , won over the @entity61 rift , causing it to become extinct , avoiding the break - up of the @entity16 continent and the formation of a @entity72			1
' how the @entity7 looks today : researchers say a minor change in the twist of a tectonic plate could have led to a very different @entity26 the team say their study highlights the importance of rift orientation relative to extension direction as key factor deciding whether an ocean basin opens or an aborted rift basin forms in the continental interior			0

the @entity22 part of this giant rift system evolved into an ocean basin , whereas its northern part along the @entity104 became stuck			0
the team say their complex numerical models gave a simple explanation : the larger the angle between rift trend and extensional direction , the more force is required to maintain a rift system			0
the @entity61 rift featured a nearly orthogonal orientation with respect to westward extension which required distinctly more force than its ultimately successful @entity67 @entity22 opponent .			0

break - up of the supercontinent @entity12 130 million years ago could have lead to a completely different world
would have dramatically altered shape of the @entity16 and @entity17 continent
