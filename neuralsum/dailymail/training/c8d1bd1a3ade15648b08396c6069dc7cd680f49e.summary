@entity0 did not turn up to a charity event on friday where he was scheduled to meet young fans alongside @entity4 derby participants @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 , his compatriots from @entity9			1
@entity0 said he could not make it because he needed to pick up family members from the airport - even though his agent pencilled in the event several weeks ago			1
but @entity7 , the @entity15 hard - man who will be marking @entity0 at the @entity16 , had another theory			1
‘ i thought he was going to be here , just like you did			2
maybe he ’s scared ! ’ @entity20 striker @entity0 takes part in training on saturday @entity7 was not being entirely serious			1
but the pair do have history and @entity0 ’s decision to swerve the @entity27 community event does heighten anticipation for their duel on sunday — the ultimate grudge match in a derby full of blood and thunder			1
the pair were @entity9 team - mates at the @entity37 and it was well - known they exchanged angry words after @entity7 invited his best friend , pop star @entity39 , into the dressing - room after a game			1
@entity39 happens to be the former boyfriend of @entity0 ’s partner @entity43 , who is also a singer , and @entity0 was furious by what he regarded as his team - mate ’s treachery			1
even putting aside their personal relationship , @entity7 promises no quarter will be given professionally			1
@entity5 , @entity7 and @entity6 take part in a charity event on friday @entity0 scored four goals in @entity20 ’s last @entity27 home game against @entity54 and he has taken over the mantle from @entity56 as the hottest striker in @entity58			1
if @entity7 stops @entity0 , @entity15 will believe they can win			1
‘ he ’s one of the top strikers in the world and you have to stick close to him , that ’s for sure			2
be very attentive and get into him with a degree of firmness , ’ asserts 24 - year - old @entity7			1
‘ it will be a hard game and you have to play in a hard way			2
i do n’t mean go crunching in , but to go in tough , the way he does			2
you have to play with close marking and strong tackles			2
‘ certainly in the penalty area he is a very quick mover and gets into position very quickly			2
he can be controlled but it is up to us to keep an eye on where he is at all times			2
‘ i ’ve never played against him before			0
we might exchange the odd word during the game but generally with opponents you tend to forget [ who they are ]			0
you put all that behind you , you go out there for the team and winning is everything			0
’ @entity91 may be given a central role in the @entity4 derby after @entity94 was ruled out @entity7 played as a left - back during the @entity37 when @entity9 reached the final			1
the fact he has been centre - back for @entity15 so far this season sums up the chronic injury crisis that has beset @entity15 boss @entity101			1
he can not call on centre - halves @entity102 , @entity104 and @entity105 as well as striker @entity106			2
@entity107 is just coming back from long - term injury and would be a risk to start			0
on the plus side , skipper @entity110 is back from suspension and he will be looking to add to his record tally of 11 goals in the @entity4 derby			2
@entity7 , whose £ 16 million summer move from @entity116 was initially delayed because of work permits caused by an ongoing dispute in @entity9 involving his family and neighbours , is happy to take on the responsibility in the middle			1
‘ the coach knows i ’m very happy to play left or central , ’ he stresses			0
unusually , @entity15 and @entity20 go into the derby having failed to win their last couple of games			1
@entity5 shows off his skills during a joint @entity27 charity event on friday as champions , expectations are particularly high at @entity20 , who will be without playmaker @entity94 who was injured in the disappointing midweek @entity133 defeat by @entity135			0
this will also be @entity20 ’s fourth game in 13 days whereas @entity15 have played only once in the corresponding period			1
it is a situation city manager @entity140 accepts is not ideal , particularly with morale low after a midweek @entity133 exit , but he does not want his players to use it as an excuse			0
‘ of course when you have the whole week to work for a game , maybe you can do it better , ’ he accepts			0
‘ when you play every three days , you are just trying to recover as you can			0
‘ but last year we played a lot more games than @entity152 and we had an obligation to win			0
this year might be the same			0
we must play the amount of games we have to play and win the games			0
’ @entity20 midfielder @entity159 wears a snood to keep warm during training @entity20 have been the dominant side in derbies for the past few seasons , their most notable victory being a 6 - 1 romp at @entity167 in 2011			0
but their most recent successes were also 3 - 0 and 4 - 1			0
‘ i do n’t think those scorelines are normal			0
even half - nil would do this time , ’ smiled the @entity169			0
perhaps the outcome will depend on the private battle between @entity0 and @entity7			1
they both grew up more than seven thousand miles away in @entity9 , but on sunday it is all about the pride of @entity4			0
first - team players from both @entity4 clubs were on hand to take part in a @entity27 session between @entity20 in the @entity182 and the @entity183 .			0

@entity15 *defender* @entity7 will be marking @entity0 in derby
the pair have history after angry words at the @entity37 in @entity190
@entity0 has replaced @entity56 as the hottest striker in @entity58
