by @entity0 published : 17:28 est , 30 november 2013 updated : 20:25 est , 30 november 2013 @entity1 , the 11th @entity2 , is famous for getting wet when he commanded the tide to stay back			1
is @entity4 a latter - day @entity1 ? last week , mr @entity4 set himself against decades of @entity6 doctrine by demanding that the right of ‘ free movement of people ’ in the @entity6 should be a ‘ qualified right ’			1
that is to say , we all recognise that the right that people should be free to travel wherever they wish is a high ideal , but it has practical limits			1
@entity4 and @entity16 at the beach : leading @entity18 @entity0 has compared the prime minister to @entity1 the @entity21 people are not intolerant or unwelcoming			1
we have thrived on importing the skills , energy , creativity and rich traditions of other nations			1
but the @entity21 are also a practical people , and do n’t like being told what to do			1
your elected government should have the right to decide who comes into our country , who stays , on what terms , and who should be forced to leave			1
shortly after the @entity21 joined what was misleadingly called ‘ the @entity39 ’ in 1972 , @entity36 , master of the rolls , said the @entity40 was ‘ like an incoming tide			1
it flows into the estuaries and up the rivers			2
it can not be held back ’			2
reflecting this incoming tide of @entity6 law , the @entity21 is bracing itself for a fresh wave of economic migrants from the newest and poorest members of the @entity6 , @entity49 and @entity50			2
former labour home secretary @entity51 has even said ‘ frictions ’ with local people could lead racial tensions to ‘ explode ’ in a repeat of the riots that rocked @entity58 towns in 2001			2
when we joined the @entity60 , we were one of only eight members			2
it is one of the joys of our time that so many new countries , who were back then under the jackboot of @entity70 communism , can aspire to join the @entity72 family of democratic nations			2
the @entity74 holidaying in @entity75 : @entity0 says the prime minister must do more than he has so far suggested on immigration but the principle of the ‘ free movement of people ’ in the @entity6 which seemed sensible back then has today become a dangerous dogma			1
back in 1972 , if anyone had suggested signing the @entity40 would lead to a million @entity72 migrants coming to the @entity21 , to work , to live in our houses , to use our public services and to draw social security , they would have been scoffed at			2
but since 2004 , that is exactly what has happened			2
the more honest @entity91 such as @entity92 now frankly admit it was a monumental mistake to expand the @entity6 without placing restrictions on ‘ free movement ’ in the @entity6			2
the prime minister says ‘ things have gone wrong ’			1
how right he is ! many migrants come to @entity21 to work , to save and to invest , but many are also attracted by generous child benefit and welfare payments , and access to our free @entity103			0
@entity0 believes that @entity4 could do more on immigration last week , mr @entity4 announced a series of measures to restrict access to benefits and said ‘ free movement ’ should only be a ‘ qualified right ’			1
but there is a problem			0
that incoming tide of @entity6 law			0
speeches alone will make no difference			0
you still need all 28 states to agree before you can start unpicking the basic principles of the @entity40			0
the government is already being prosecuted under @entity6 law for trying to restrict benefits to @entity125 residents from other @entity6 countries			0
and the @entity6 commissioner @entity127 exploded on @entity128 , insisting that ‘ free movement is not negotiable , as long as you are a member of the @entity130 ’			0
‘ free movement ’ is an article of faith , laid down by the @entity133			0
so long as @entity136 continues to accept the supremacy of @entity6 law , there is no way @entity4 can hold back this tide			1
maybe he wants to show that ? on thursday , the key commons committee on @entity142 , chaired by @entity143 , published a groundbreaking report which reminds @entity136 that the right to veto @entity72 laws was central to our decision to join			0
it also sets out how @entity136 must act to restore our national democracy			0
when it is against the national interest , @entity136 should recover the right to stop a new @entity72 law applying in the @entity21			0
moreover , @entity136 could vote to cancel existing @entity6 laws			0
this is because the @entity157 itself says the @entity6 must ‘ respect the essential state functions ’ of member states			0
it is very significant these recommendations were supported unanimously by mps from all the three main parties			0
a recent @entity166 poll on immigration shows the scale of public disillusion with the entire political class			1
everyone knows they clearly can not do anything			0
only the government can act , and it means doing rather more than mr @entity4 has so far suggested , or he will be drowned in the @entity6 tide			1
we must take back control over our immigration laws from unelected @entity6 officials and foreign judges			1
we need our borders under the control of @entity21 ministers , answerable to @entity21 laws , made by your democratically elected @entity136 and adjudicated by @entity21 judges			0
that ’s what democracy means : the right to make or unmake your own laws			0
@entity1 was in fact a wise @entity2			1
he wanted to demonstrate his power was limited			0
i trust @entity4 is wise too			1
by refusing to negotiate , the @entity6 is creating conditions to show everyone why even the most reasonable prime minister must act unilaterally			1
@entity143 tabled the @entity198 in the @entity199 on friday , to implement his committee ’s findings			0
@entity136 can give @entity4 the power he needs			1
he should take it .			0
