@entity0 today pledged to protect the jobs of 10,000 police officers as @entity3 claimed @entity5 cuts had allowed rapists and violent criminals to go free			1
the @entity3 leader said the bobby on the beat is ' at risk of disappearing ' , while rising numbers of serious criminals ' are being let off the hook '			1
but the launch of @entity3 's criminal justice plans risked being over-shadowed by the news that the party 's police adviser , lord @entity18 , is be investigated over hotly disputed allegations of a cover - up of police corruption in the bungled @entity24 murder probe			1
labour leader @entity0 said the bobby on the beat is ' at risk of disappearing ' , while rising numbers of serious criminals ' are being let off the hook ' mr @entity0 hopes to get back on the front foot today with the promise of action to protect community policing			1
it comes after the chaotic launch of a plan to abolish non-dom tax status for foreigners and a deeply personal row with the @entity5 over claims he ' stabbed his brother in the back ' and would do the same to @entity43 to get into power			0
today @entity3 claims the police are ' struggling to keep up ' with the rise in child sexual exploitation , terrorism and online crime while public safety is being ' put at risk ' by a chaotic prison and probation system			1
police and crime commissioners ( @entity56 ) would be axed to help fund the £ 800 million plan to guarantee neighbourhood policing across @entity59 and @entity60			0
pccs were set up by the @entity5 to increase accountability , but turnout was just 15 per cent in elections held in 2011			0
mr @entity0 said : ' because of the @entity69 ' decisions , neighbourhood policing - the foundation of good @entity43 policing - is at risk of disappearing , whilst increasing numbers of serious criminals are being let off the hook			1
' @entity3 has a better plan			1
we will make different choices , finding savings to safeguard 10,000 officers in the next three years			0
' we will ensure victims are at the heart of the criminal justice system with the country 's first ever victims ' law			0
and we will ensure the police have the powers they need to keep us safe , including proper controls for dangerous terror suspects			0
' mr @entity0 and shadow home secretary @entity88 joined with police officers from @entity90 during a walk around @entity92 in @entity93 ms @entity88 claimed the @entity5 were planning deeper cuts to policing in the next @entity96 ' even though the police are already struggling to keep up with rising complex cases ' new laws would introduce a local policing commitment that required forces to guarantee neighbourhood policing and 10,000 officers would be safeguarded for three years , the party said			1
axing the @entity56 combined with charging higher fees for gun licences and requiring police forces to share services and carry out joint procurement would fund the plans , according to @entity3			1
lord @entity109 headed an independent commission on policing by the @entity3			1
however , last night it emerged the former metropolitan police commissioner and crossbench peer , is to be investigated over the @entity24 murder inquiry			0
@entity3 said new laws would introduce a local policing commitment that required forces to guarantee neighbourhood policing and 10,000 officers would be safeguarded for three years the @entity119 ( @entity119 ) said it will investigate claims that the former @entity122 chief failed to hand over key information to the @entity124 regarding the black teenager ’s race hate killing			1
the watchdog probe stems from a complaint from @entity24 ’s father @entity129			0
lord @entity109 was deputy commissioner of the @entity122 from 1998 to 2000 – while the @entity124 report was being compiled – before serving five years as the @entity43 ’s most senior policeman			1
the complaint concerns a letter to the @entity124 in 1998 , in which @entity109 stated that no officer or former officer involved in giving evidence was under investigation for corruption			2
it is alleged that the letter included misleading information			0
a source said : ‘ any suggestion that anyone from the @entity122 would seek to withhold the truth from the @entity124 at that time is completely untrue			0
last year @entity147 wrote to @entity109 to say he had done nothing wrong			2
’ last night , @entity149 – which revealed details of the @entity119 probe into @entity109 – quoted him as saying : ‘ step very carefully , i ’m not putting up with any more c * * p about this			1
’ quoting from a letter he received from mr @entity147 , @entity109 was reported to have said : ‘ no one is suggesting that you did anything that was culpable in any way			2
’ despite the revelation , @entity109 was quoted by @entity3 backing their policing plans			1
he said : ' this is the right plan for neighbourhood policing , following the plans set out by the independent commission i had the pleasure to chair			0
' it is not credible to say you can take away resources on the scale the government are talking about without wiping out neighbourhood policing			0
; and it does n't show the right priorities to be spending significant sums on police and crime commissioners , nor to be ideologically opposed to the shared services and joint procurement that simply must be driven through			0
' ' cover - up ' : former met police commissioner @entity109 ( left ) is to be investigated into allegations of a cover - up over the @entity24 murder probe in the nineties shadow home secretary @entity88 said : ' under the @entity5 we 've seen fewer police on the beat , longer waits for 999 calls and less justice for victims as there have been fewer arrests and prosecutions for rising crimes like violence , rape or child sex offences			1
' now they plan deeper cuts to policing in the next @entity96 even though the police are already struggling to keep up with rising complex cases such as child sexual exploitation , terrorism or online crime			2
' @entity3 's manifesto will commit to improved crime prevention and the introduction of a new child protection unit to tackle sexual exploitation			2
prison reforms would see inmates spend more time working and learning while the controversial @entity218 programme @entity3 introduced to stop radicalisation would be overhauled as part of plans to deal with the growing terror threat			2
but @entity5 home secretary @entity223 said the government had increased the proportion of officers on the frontline			0
she added : ' these are the same tired , unfunded promises from a @entity3 who tied up the police with red tape and central targets , and who have opposed everything we have done to help the police do more with less			2
' people have had enough of @entity3 's made - up numbers and scaremongering			2
when we started to clear up the mess left by their legacy of debt , they warned that crime would rise			0
