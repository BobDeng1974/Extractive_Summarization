more than 260 years after his death , his music is still known and adored by millions			1
according to a new analysis , however , some of @entity5 ’s best - loved works may actually have been written by his wife			1
an expert claims that @entity9 , @entity5 ’s second wife , was the composer of some of his major pieces , including the cello suites			2
@entity5 's second wife , @entity9 , may have composed some of his finest works , academics have claimed @entity16 , professor of music at @entity18 in @entity19 , has spent years compiling evidence , with a comprehensive study of handwriting and manuscripts			1
he will present his findings in a documentary entitled @entity26 , due to be screened at @entity27 in @entity28 next week			0
the film will detail his analysis of ink and writing style , which he says suggests mrs @entity5 did far more work on the pieces than previously thought			1
he argues that @entity9 also wrote the aria from the @entity36 and the first prelude of @entity38 : book i. presented by @entity42 composer @entity41 , the film will include evidence from an @entity45 scientist who analysed @entity5 ’s signature and his scores			2
@entity48 , a forensic document examiner , said she believed the composer was more likely to be @entity9 than @entity5 himself , saying she was as sure as possible ‘ within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty ’			2
mrs @entity5 helped her husband write the @entity55 because of his ailing health , but researchers have now claimed that she composed them herself @entity9 is already known to have transcribed for @entity5 in his later years , but researchers found the handwriting did not have the ‘ slowness or heaviness ’ of someone who is merely copying			1
they concluded that the handwriting suggested she had composed the scores herself			0
the experts also pointed to numerous corrections to music written in her hand , signalling she is likely to have been composing it as she went along			0
@entity9 , an accomplished singer , married @entity5 in 1721 when she was 20 and he was 36			0
many of her papers are said to have been destroyed after her death , leaving little trace of her legacy			0
miss @entity41 told the @entity76 : ‘ what i found fascinating is the questions it raises about the assumptions we make : that music is always written by one person and all the great masters were male by definition			0

@entity5 's second wife composed some of his finest works , academics say
study of handwriting on @entity5 's work suggests she was behind the music
researchers know mrs @entity5 helped husband write in his later years
but forensic analysis ' proves ' she was composing the scores herself
