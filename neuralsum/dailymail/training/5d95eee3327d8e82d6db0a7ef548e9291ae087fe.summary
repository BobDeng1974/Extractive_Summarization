by @entity0 and @entity1 on trial : @entity4 actor @entity3 smoking a cigarette outside @entity6 yesterday , which heard he was a drunk and a ' weak man ' but not a child rapist @entity3 might be a weak and stupid alcoholic but he did not rape a girl from the age of six , his lawyers said yesterday			1
a trial was told the @entity4 actor ’s drinking problems were being used against him in a ‘ prosecution by cliché ’			1
but @entity18 , for the @entity19 , insisted the soap star had committed the offences ‘ in drink ’			1
she told the jury to dismiss the idea the 48 - year - old was the subject of a witch hunt amid a welter of prosecutions of celebrities			1
and she said the alleged victim had nothing to gain by ‘ quite literally destroying the life ’ of an innocent man			2
‘ no one likes to think someone they liked or admired has done anything like this , ’ miss @entity35 added			0
‘ these offences are not committed by one obvious type of person			2
they are committed by individuals who are loved by their friends , who have no idea what is going on			0
’ barristers yesterday delivered their final speeches to the jury of eight women and four men at the end of the six - day trial at @entity6			2
@entity3 , who has played garage mechanic @entity55 in the @entity57 soap for 30 years and is being tried under his real name @entity3 , denies five counts of rape , three of indecent assault and four relating to sexual activity with a child			2
closing speech : prosecution barrister @entity18 ( left ) urged the jury as they retired yesterday to find the actor guilty , as he watched on from the dock ( right ) defence : barrister @entity69 told the eight women and four men ' the only right thing to do is not guilty ' @entity69 , defending , told the jury @entity3 should not be found guilty just because he was ‘ weak , inadequate and a drunk ’			1
‘ this has been prosecution by cliché , ’ he added			0
‘ mr @entity3 drinks a lot , he has his demons			0
what ’s that supposed to mean ? he has troubles			0
what ’s that supposed to mean ? that ’s all the @entity19 can come up with for a motive			0
’ he said the evidence put forward by the girl was ‘ inconsistent ’ and lacked detail and was at times ‘ incoherent and unbelievable ’			0
arguments : @entity3 's legal team admitted he was troubled and had ' demons ' but added this did not make him a sex offender going home : the actor , 48 , was swept away by car yesterday as the jury began its deliberations he said that there was no physical evidence to back up the victim ’s claims : ‘ there ’s an agonising lack of detail from this witness			1
she ca n’t give you details because it did not happen and that ’s why her story varies according to who she ’s talking to			0
’ he dismissed prosecution assertions that , as an actor , @entity3 had been putting on a performance in court : ‘ did you think he was acting ? ‘ @entity116 was his evidence the scared and frightened evidence of a man who faces the most unbelievable and terrible thing ever to happen to a man – a girl saying he raped her ? ’ famous face : @entity4 actor @entity3 exits @entity125 @entity6 as a minder helps him through the crowd of photographers outside he said no child pornography was found on @entity3 ’s computer , no adults had been uneasy having their children around him and he had no criminal convictions			1
he told the jury that if they found the actor guilty they were ‘ going to take a man ’s life away from him ’ and cast him into the ‘ outer darkness ’			1
‘ nothing in this case has taken you anywhere near the level of certainty that you would need so that you can look in the mirror in the days that come and say , “ i was sure ” , ’ he said			0
the jury has retired to consider its verdicts			2

actor denies 12 sex offences against a young girl , including five of rape
@entity159 's @entity18 admits he 's a ' weak man ' but told jury to return not guilty verdicts
defence say girl is telling ' *absolute* truth ' and her ' courage ' *deserves* guilty
they add that the actor , 48 , is not a victim of a celebrity witch hunt
judge told jury : ' do *n't* allow *sympathy* to cloud judgment for either side '
