by @entity0 published : 14:48 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 09:08 est , 28 september 2013 social workers and medics knew nothing about the young boy discovered starved and mummified in his cot because his mother failed to co-operate with services , a court heard today			1
@entity9 , whose severely malnourished and skeletal remains were only discovered almost two years after he died in squalor at his mother 's filthy home had never been seen by a gp after his birth			1
and there were no medical records on him from the age of two weeks old until he died aged four and a half , @entity16 heard			1
@entity21 's 4 - year - old son @entity9 was found dead at her home in @entity16 his body was still dressed in a baby - gro , intended for a baby aged six to nine months , when neighbours called police in september 2011 , but by then it was too late and he had died 21 months earlier , on december 15 2009 , his body lying in the cot ever since			1
his mother @entity21 , who drank heavily and suffered domestic violence from her husband @entity33 , consistently failed to keep doctors appointments , failed to get him immunised and slammed the door in the face of repeated calls from health visitors , the court heard			1
@entity33 arriving at @entity16 where @entity21 is charged with the manslaughter of their son , @entity9 @entity21 , 43 , from @entity16 , denies the manslaughter of her son by gross negligence by allowing him to starve and failing to get medical assistance			1
dr @entity45 , a paediatrician at @entity46 in @entity47 , told the jury medical records showed after @entity9 was born in june 2007 , he was only ever seen once by a midwife and once by a social worker , in november 2006 , three years before he died , when he appeared ' well cared for and well dressed '			1
' from two weeks of age , we know nothing about this child , ' dr @entity52 told the jury			2
' his personal development , behaviour , his personality or general health			0
it ’s a blank page			0
' the picture of non-engagement and failure to respond to professionals from a variety of areas is a matter of great concern			0
' the court heard police had been repeatedly called to @entity21 's home , starting in may 1996 , to rows and fights with her husband			1
after @entity9 was born and deemed fit and healthy , health visitors repeatedly called but failed to get into the house			1
on one occasion the health visitor saw curtains moving inside , but no one answered the door and on another occasion the door was opened but @entity21 , wearing just a towel , ' was perceived to be hostile , said she was busy and slammed the door '			1
when @entity21 failed to register the child ’s birth she was visited by the registrar and was seen to have a ' puffed up ' eye injury and smelt of alcohol			2
dr @entity52 said ' multi-agency ' meetings were called about the situation , involving police , council and health authorities			2
paediatrician @entity45 said ' multi-agency ' meetings were called about @entity21 and her son , involving police , council and health authorities but by october 2009 after repeated failed appointments , @entity21 's gp surgery removed mother and child from the patients list - as is normal practice			1
' it ’s something being addressed locally because it means children sink further beneath the radar , ' dr @entity52 added			0
@entity110 , prosecuting , asked the witness : ' do you have any view on the history of non-engagement by @entity21 ? ' dr @entity52 said : ' the picture is one of gross negligence and non-engagement with professionals			2
' we have the history of domestic violence			0
all of which suggests things were not well , limited contact with the mother suggests she was feeling low since the birth and had taken to using alcohol as a prop			0
after @entity9 was born and deemed healthy , health visitors repeatedly called but failed to get into the house , the jury was told ' the picture provides evidence of neglect of the child ’s health and emotional needs			1
' earlier the court heard @entity21 did nothing to alert the emergency services about her son ’s plight and even ordered pizza within hours of his death			0
he was only found after police community support officer @entity149 went to the house on a number of occasions due to concerns raised by neighbours			0
the court heard how there was a terrible smell coming from the terraced house and , when @entity21 eventually opened the door , there were flies buzzing around her			2
police went into the property and ' what they discovered disturbed even hardened officers , mr @entity164 said			0
in police interviews @entity21 said her son had become particularly unwell on december 14 , 2009 and died the next day			2
she told police that things deteriorated after her son ’s death and she began to drink a bottle of vodka a day			0
her house contained a huge amount of rubbish , rotting matter , faeces and empty bottles and smell ' almost beyond description , ' the jury has heard			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
