she said , “ there are lots of people worse than him ” , and she walked on			0
i previously stopped another nurse and asked when a doctor had last seen him , and i was just brushed aside , and told a doctor had been to the floor but had not seen my husband , but she said , “ we know what to do			1
” ‘ well i feel that “ we know what to do ” meant “ do nothing ”			0
’ speaking on @entity104 this morning , the mp said she was aware of the challenges that overstretched @entity13 staff faced			0

there were no nurses around			0
‘ at eight o’clock , just before he died , all the lights in the ward went on and somebody shouted “ anybody for breakfast ? ” ‘ it was obviously totally inappropriate when they knew there was somebody dying in that four - bed ward			2
the man next to him had been feeling hot and had a fan on and it was blowing the cold air towards my husband			2
i really do feel he died of cold and he died from people who did n’t care			1
