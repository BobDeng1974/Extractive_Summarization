but , you know , i was a shell of my former self at one point			0

" ' asked if she had ever confronted the rapist , who was 20 years older than her , she said : ' i think it would terrify me			0
as she was : @entity6 , real name @entity6 , on an @entity104 show back in 2005 , when she would have been about 19 - it was around this time that she was attacked ' i saw him one time in a store and i was so paralysed by fear			2
