by @entity0 published : 05:56 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 06:06 est , 16 november 2012 a group of nude protesters marched to their courthouse on wednesday to file a lawsuit against the city and county of @entity7			2
they aim to stop city leaders from passing a law which would stop them appearing naked in public			1
a second instance could lead to a $ 200 fine , while a third means a fine of up to $ 500 and the possibility of a year in prison			1
the nudists say the proposed law violates their right to freedom of speech			1
@entity32 , a city supervisor representing the @entity33 , introduced the proposal which would stop backsides and genitals being exposed in public			1
exempt from the law would be naked breasts and children under five , as well as events permitted by the city - including the annual gay pride parade			1
punishment : the law would see nudists fined up to $ 100 for one violation , $ 200 for two and $ 500 with a potential prison sentence of a year for three former stripper turned stay - at - home mother of three , @entity51 , is a plaintiff in the case			1
she also hosts a television show called ' my naked truth ' on which both she and her guests go unclothed			2
the 43 - year - old said : ' being naked is a birth - given freedom , not a crime			1
' at a public hearing related to the new law on november 5 ms @entity51 stripped while speaking and was led away by security			1
video : @entity51 strips during a public hearing warning - contains nudity she wrote about it later : ' i have had it with sexual repression			1
i have had it with puritanism			0
i have had it with hypocrisy			0
' i have had it with snotty stale dudes in suits telling me what i am allowed and not allowed to wear , inhale , enjoy , believe			0
' @entity32 really tipped the scale			0
i came to his hearing and ripped my clothes off to prove to everybody that nobody is going to die if i do that			1
opposites : @entity32 ( left ) says nudity in @entity7 has caused ' anger and frustration ' , while @entity90 ( right ) is one of the nude protestors ' any victims reported ? did anybody need an ambulance ? does anybody need therapy now that they saw me naked ? ' ms @entity51 continued : ' first of all , i had the biggest blast doing it ! i would do it every day if i could			1
i felt so much joy after this act of civil disobedience , i ca n't begin to tell you			0
' discussion : @entity106 , of @entity107 , talks with fellow nudists following the march she added : ' it was so much fun to yell at @entity32 and call him a fascist right to his face			0
i wish i could do this to @entity115 ! the audience loved it			0
' mr @entity32 introduced the ordinance in october and said that nudity had caused a lot of anger and frustration in @entity7			0
' we ’ve always had random and sporadic public nudity in @entity7 , and no one had a problem with that , ' he said			2
' in the last two years , things have changed			0
in the @entity33 , in particular , we now have men who take their clothes off and hang out every day of the week , and that has caused a lot of anger and frustration in the neighborhood			0
' leaving : nudist @entity136 ( left ) , of @entity7 , is asked to leave the @entity138 @entity137 after a police officer cited required clothing rules ' the city is trying to legislate against the naturalness of the naked body , and that is wrong , ' said @entity136 , 66 , another plaintiff			2
mr @entity136 , who runs a website for ' urban nudists ' , has campaigned naked while running unsuccessfully for mayor and city supervisor in recent years and estimates he spends 120 days a year naked in public			1
' i ’d go more , but i get uncomfortable if it ’s too cold or foggy , ' he explained			0
' nude is not lewd , ' mr @entity136 added			0
' that is our mantra			0
' words of wisdom : @entity158 , of @entity7 , speaks to fellow nudists during the march @entity161 , the group 's lawyer , said : ' the city is overstepping its authority			0
' the act of being naked is not enough to be obscene or indecently exposed under @entity167 law			2
' the board of supervisors will vote on the measure next week but the nudists asked for a preliminary injunction to stop the law being implemented if it is passed until after their claims that it violates their rights are considered by a judge			2
one law which was passed last year saw nude citizens having to place a barrier , a towel for example , between their bare backsides and any public seats			1
delay : the group want an injunction against the proposed law if it is passed next week , until their case is heard by a judge not obscene : the group 's lawyer says the act of being naked is not enough to be judged ' indecently exposed ' or ' obscene '			2

law would see them fined *increasing* amounts with a third strike resulting in prison sentence of up to a year
