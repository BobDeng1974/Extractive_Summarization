by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 is confident @entity3 will become a ' terrific player ' for @entity5 and expects the club 's fans to welcome him			1
in need of another striker following the exit of star man @entity12 , the @entity8 last week plumped for a shock move for the maverick @entity14			2
arriving in a cut - price Â£ 16million just 18 months after leaving the @entity16 , @entity15 said @entity3 was a ' risk worth taking ' , but admitted the player was facing his ' last chance ' to thrive at the top level			2
new boy : @entity2 has backed @entity3 ( left ) to shine at @entity5 the 24 - year - old was thrown straight in at the deep end by the @entity8 boss on sunday , who started the striker from the outset at @entity28 six days after arriving from @entity29			1
@entity5 comfortably triumphed 3 - 0 despite @entity3 missing a host of chances , but @entity2 saw enough to be confident he will have a big impact at @entity33			1
' with all due respect to @entity36 and @entity29 , @entity3 is going to get a different kind of support here , ' the @entity8 captain said			1
' these are the best fans in the world and traditionally they always get behind our strikers			0
i 've told him it 's there for him			0
nearly : @entity3 ( centre ) powered a header goalwards just minutes into his @entity5 debut shooting boots : @entity3 ( left ) had the chance to double @entity5 's lead but rushed his strike ' if he plays well and works hard for these supporters , they 'll get behind him			1
he wo n't have experienced support like that he 's about to get			0
' he 's a big , strong lad			0
he held it up terrifically well			0
all eyes were on him and i thought he was a terrific team player			2
' he did a lot of ugly work for the team and showed some really good touches			0
you 've got to remember that he 's only had three lots of 45 minutes in pre-season , so with game time and getting used to the manager and players around him , he 's going to be a terrific player for us			2
' nice try : @entity3 first half strike was applauded by a laughing @entity15 ( right ) @entity3 was replaced just after the hour mark at @entity75 , by which point the three points were secure			2
@entity78 swept home after just eight minutes , before a @entity2 penalty and solo goal by @entity82 in the second half secured another dominant win against @entity28			1
@entity82 's goal was particularly impressive as he dispossessed substitute @entity86 and raced the length of the @entity28 half to unleash a fine low drive past @entity90			1
' i 'm just glad we got the signing over the line because i had watched him quite a bit for @entity96 , ' @entity2 said of the left - back , speaking to the club 's official website , www.liverpoolfc.com			0
good start : @entity2 ( centre ) was full of praise for @entity3 's @entity5 debut ' i had watched @entity105 clips of him and i knew he was a flier , quick and very aggressive with and without the ball			1
' he showed his aggression with the ball today with a terrific run and the finish at the end of it was just pure quality			0
' if a @entity117 or @entity118 player did that , everybody would be getting carried away			0
give him credit - that was a top goal			0
' finish : @entity2 was impressed by @entity82 ( above ) , who scored @entity5 's third against @entity28			1

@entity2 *believes* @entity3 will become a ' terrific player ' for @entity5
