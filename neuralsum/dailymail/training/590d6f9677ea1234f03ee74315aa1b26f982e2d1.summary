a woman tasked with not saying sorry for an entire week has shared what she learned from the eye - opening experiment			1
@entity5 - based journalist @entity4 wrote on @entity6 that before giving up the word , she did n't realize the extent to which she had been using it ' as a way of seeming less powerful , or as a way of showing my subservience to someone more powerful than me			1
' having to avoid saying ' sorry ' opened her eyes to the tendency of women to over-apologize , especially in the workplace			2
indeed , while @entity4 expected to have a tough time not apologizing to friends and her boyfriend for emotional reasons or to strangers for public clumsiness , the real problem was at work			1
@entity4 found that she had been saying ' sorry ' to bosses and co-workers as a means of expressing and acknowledging her own inadequacy			1
instead of explaining why a story she was working on was late , for instance , she would apologize out of the fear of being looked down upon			2
' a " sorry " to an editor about a late piece really meant " i feel that i ’m an impostor , and i ’m terrified you 'll never work with me again upon discovering that i 'm not perfect and am turning this piece in late , " ' she explains			2
during the experiment , she made an effort to find alternatives to ' sorry '			0
for example , instead of apologizing for a late article , she simply told her editor that it would be in soon			1
' i found that explaining what was actually going on , instead of just offering a reflexive " sorry , " did n't seem to annoy her , or anyone else , the way i had anticipated , ' she says			0
this tendency to over-apologize is shared among the female sex , says @entity4			1
' we 're raised to give out insincere apologies that are actually just displays of power and subservience from the time we 're little kids , ' she writes			0
she notes the different ways in which men and women ask for things at work , with women usually beginning the conversation with , ' sorry for bothering you , ' while men just go straight to the point			0
excuses : ' a " sorry " to an editor about a late piece really meant " i feel that i ’m an impostor , and i ’m terrified you 'll never work with me again upon discovering that i 'm not perfect , " ' she explains while over-apologizing is n't doing women any favors in the workplace , taking it to the opposite extreme is just as detrimental			2
this is ' the great irony of women in any position of power , ' says @entity4			1
' apologize constantly , and everyone says you ’re annoying , sniveling , have low self - esteem ; never apologize , and you 're just a b * * * *			0
' it 's a set of standards that are so deeply culturally ingrained , it ’s tough not to believe them about yourself			0
' through her experiment , @entity4 learned that it 's possible - even beneficial - to function at work without apologizing whenever anything goes wrong			1
' instead of protecting me , my " sorries " eroded me , ' she says			0
' i do n't know if permanently cutting back on them will completely change my life , but i think it 'll help me realize that my existence is n't something that i need to apologize for			0

journalist @entity4 was told by her editor to not say sorry for an entire week , and to write about the *results*
