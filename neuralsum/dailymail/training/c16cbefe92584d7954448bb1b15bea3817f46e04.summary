@entity0 insists sentiment has no bearing on his determination to see @entity3 be given a contract extension			1
@entity6 ’s captain , who is out of contract next june , raised the prospect that he could play somewhere else next season , after he revealed in an interview with @entity11 last week that he had yet to be offered a new deal and has no plans to retire			1
that statement pricked the ears of several managers , notably @entity18 ’s @entity17 , who admitted he would certainly consider a move for the 34 - year - old , as he believes @entity3 has the quality to ‘ continue at a high level for a couple more years ’			1
@entity3 's @entity6 contract expires at the end of the season and he insists he will not retire the @entity27 captain was in action on saturday as @entity6 went down 1 - 0 to @entity29 at @entity30 @entity6 boss @entity0 ( right ) , standing on the touchline looking on with @entity29 boss @entity32 , insists a new contract for @entity3 would have ' nothing to do with sentiment ' and he would deserve it @entity36 ( right ) used to play for @entity18 , a side who @entity3 has been linked to @entity29 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity39 7 ; @entity40 7.5 , @entity41 7 , @entity42 7 , @entity43 7 ; @entity44 7.5 , @entity45 7 ; @entity46 6 ( @entity47 26mins , 7 ) , @entity48 8 , @entity49 6 ( @entity50 66 , 7 ) ; @entity51 6 ( @entity52 46 , 7 )			1

crucially , though , so does @entity0 and he explained that his motives for wanting to keep @entity3 as the heart of his team have got nothing to do with the fact he has been at the club all his life or because he has a strong relationship with him			1
@entity0 has held initial discussions with @entity3 ’s representatives and has recommended to @entity89 , the club ’s @entity91 owners , that his terms be renewed			1
@entity6 hope to have the matter concluded swiftly once formal talks begin			2
‘ it is certainly not sentimental , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ as the manager of this club , you ca n’t afford to do that			0
i look at his contribution since i ’ve been here			0
i came here two - and - a - half years ago when @entity3 was 32 , had struggled with injury and had n’t played consistently over a number of years			1
' i came in , sold him the idea and the philosophy of how we wanted to work and his importance to it			0
in that period , he has been outstanding			0
maybe the team has n’t played so well this year - and maybe there is a focus on @entity3 - but he ’s been brilliant for me			1
‘ both on and off the field , as a leader and a captain , and i want to ensure that on this second curve we ’re on , in terms of the development of this group , he is very much a part of that			0
so there is certainly no sentiment involved in it			0
@entity17 believes that the @entity6 captain can play on at the top for at least two more years @entity52 shows a poacher 's instinct to prod past @entity58 to punish @entity62 's ( right ) mistake @entity36 ( xentre ) was once again a peripheral figure , with £ 16m man flattering to deceive on @entity134 @entity52 ’s strike for @entity29 in the 1 - 0 win over @entity6 ensured this game ’s ability to keep producing goals continues			1
these clubs have not shared a 0 - 0 draw since february 1974			1
‘ when you see some of his passes and his influence in the changing room , he is still an outstanding player			0
he is the perfect example for a lot of our players to learn from			0
’ @entity3 was the only @entity6 player who looked capable of making anything happen at @entity30 on saturday			1
] too many of his colleagues failed to impose themselves on a drab contest from which @entity29 managed to chisel a 1 - 0 win thanks to @entity52 ’s goal			1
newcastle celebrate after @entity52 's goal inflicted @entity6 's fourth @entity159 defeat in ten games @entity162 holders @entity161 eased to a 4 - 0 victory at @entity164 on saturday , with @entity165 incredibly scoring his 22nd goal of the season			1
it was the @entity168 ’ 11th straight win ahead of tuesday ’s clash against @entity6			2
@entity6 ’s form has been wretched and since the start of september , they have floundered in the @entity159 , winning just two of their seven assignments			2
on tuesday they face a huge task in @entity161 against @entity162 holders real			0
a showdown with @entity177 at @entity178 then awaits next saturday and with no momentum behind them , few will give @entity6 a chance of taking anything from either assignment			2
@entity0 , though , is refusing to grumble			2
‘ it is why we worked so hard , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ we wanted to be involved in this type of game , ( against @entity161 ) , because it means we ’ve been successful			0
‘ this result was n’t what we wanted and we have to work to rectify it			0
’ @entity50 hops on @entity52 's back in front of the adoring fans as @entity29 take the lead on saturday video great day for us - @entity32			1

@entity6 lost 1 - 0 to @entity29 at @entity30 on saturday
@entity52 *grabbed* only goal as @entity6 's poor run of form continued
@entity6 boss @entity0 wants to offer @entity3 new deal
@entity3 's contract expires at end of season and he says he will not retire
@entity0 insists new contract offer will have ' nothing to do with sentiment '
