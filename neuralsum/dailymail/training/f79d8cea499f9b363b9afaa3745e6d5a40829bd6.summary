by @entity0 published : 05:35 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 13:49 est , 15 august 2013 the meteor that exploded over @entity2 in february caused a thin stratospheric dust belt that travelled around the world in just four days			1
@entity6 satellites made the unprecedented measurements of the meteor which is thought to have released 30 times more energy than the atomic bomb that destroyed @entity10			1
the meteor fireball measuring 18 meters across and weighing 11,000 metric tons , screamed into @entity14 's atmosphere at 41,600 mph			2
for comparison , the meteor that triggered mass extinctions , including the dinosaurs , measured about 10 kilometres across and released about 1 billion times the energy of the atom bomb			1
some of the surviving pieces of the @entity23 bolide fell to the ground			0
but the explosion also deposited hundreds of tons of dust up in the stratosphere forming a thin but cohesive and persistent dust belt			1
the meteor fireball , pictured , that crashed into @entity2 in february was part of a 656 - feet wide asteroid called 2011 @entity44			0
@entity46 astrophysicists analysed fragments of the meteor and claim it came from the @entity51 asteroid that regularly crosses passed @entity14 as it orbits the sun experts said the meteor that left a 50 - foot hole in a frozen lake on the outskirts of @entity23 , in the @entity57 , weighed around 100,000 tonnes and measured 55 feet in diameter ‘ we wanted to know if our satellite could detect the meteor dust , ’ said atmospheric physicist @entity59 of @entity6 's @entity60			1
‘ indeed , we saw the formation of a new dust belt in @entity14 's stratosphere , and achieved the first space - based observation of the long - term evolution of a bolide plume			1
’ @entity59 and colleagues combined a series of satellite measurements with atmospheric models to simulate how the plume from the bolide explosion evolved as the stratospheric jet stream carried it around the @entity78			0
about 3.5 hours after the initial explosion , the @entity79 on the @entity6 - @entity83 @entity82 - orbiting @entity81 satellite detected the plume high in the atmosphere at an altitude of about 25 miles ( 40 kilometers ) , moving east at about 190 mph			1
video : @entity6 tracks the aftermath of the @entity23 meteor explosion burning from the friction with @entity14 's thin air , the space rock exploded 14.5 miles ( 23.3km ) above the @entity2 town @entity23 the day after the explosion , the satellite detected the plume continuing its eastward flow in the jet and reaching the @entity100			1
larger , heavier particles began to lose altitude and speed , while their smaller , lighter counterparts stayed aloft and retained speed – consistent with wind speed variations at the different altitudes			0
just four days after the explosion , the faster , higher portion of the plume had snaked its way entirely around the @entity78 and back to @entity23			2
at least three months later , a detectable belt of bolide dust was still present around the planet			2
@entity46 astrophysicists analysed fragments of the meteor that were scattered across the @entity2 town of @entity23 , where the meteor landed , and claim it came from the large @entity51 asteroid that regularly crosses passed @entity14 as it orbits the sun. they added that the piece may have broken off because of the stress caused by the gravitaional pull of the planets and the sun , or could have been caused by the asteroid hitting into something else during its orbit			2
over 1,000 people were injured by the exploding rock and scientists managed to recover more than 50 tiny fragments of the meteor , allowing them to study its contents and origin			0
as it raced through the sky , the 50 - foot wide chunk of space rock compressed the air ahead of it , creating the enormous temperatures that meant it exploded in a fireball			1
although some debris fell to earth , ‘ whipping up a pillar of ice , water and steam ’ and creating a 20 - foot - wide crater , the damage in nearby towns was actually caused by shockwaves created by the meteor breaking the sound barrier and then exploding			1
the city of @entity23 , 900 miles east of @entity157 and close to the @entity159 border , took the brunt of the impact local residents said they witnessed burning objects in the sky of the @entity23 and @entity166 regions ‘ of course , the @entity23 bolide is much smaller than the “ dinosaurs killer , ” and this is good , ’ said @entity59			2
‘ we have the unique opportunity to safely study a potentially very dangerous type of event			0
’ collectors from around the world will be keen to get hold of a piece of the meteor			0
film director @entity178 is a noted collector			0
in october a 9in piece of the @entity181 meteorite found in @entity182 in 1960 sold in @entity183 for $ 43,750 ( £ 28,200 )			0
astronomers have also revealed that the meteor could have hit @entity187 cities if it had hit at a slightly different time of day .			0

the meteor created a 50 - foot hole in a frozen lake near town of @entity23
around 3.5 hours after the explosion , its dust belt moved east at 190 mph
in four days , the belt had snaked its way around the entire planet
it released 30 times more energy than the atomic bomb in @entity10
