by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter a @entity4 woman has died getting discount cosmetic surgery in the @entity6			1
@entity7 was seeking a less expensive way to enhance her appearance and she did what many other people are now doing : travel abroad for cosmetic surgery			1
but it went horribly wrong			1
the 28 - year - old died february 20 from what the doctor told her family was a massive pulmonary embolism while getting a tummy tuck and liposuction at a clinic in the @entity6 capital recommended by friends			1
family members have serious questions about her death and want local authorities to investigate			2
' we want to know exactly what happened , ' said @entity30 , @entity7 's godmother			1
' we want to know if there was negligence			0
' sad : @entity7 , pictured , died after cosmetic surgery in the @entity6 the district attorney 's office for @entity36 says it has not yet begun an investigation because it has not received a formal complaint from @entity7 's relatives			1
family members say they plan to make one			2
shortly after @entity7 's death , the @entity42 inspected the @entity44 where she was treated and ordered the operating room temporarily closed , citing the presence of bacteria and violations of bio-sanitary regulations			1
the doctor who performed the procedure and the clinic have not responded to requests for comment			2
@entity7 's death is unusual , but it is not isolated			1
concerns about the booming cosmetic surgery business in the @entity6 are enough of an issue that the @entity59 has posted a warning on its page for travel to that country , noting that in several cases @entity65 citizens have suffered serious complications or died			1
the @entity65 @entity68 issued an alert march 7 after health authorities in the @entity65 reported that at least 19 women in five states had developed serious mycobacterial wound infections over the previous 12 months following cosmetic procedures in the @entity6 such as liposuction , tummy tucks and breast implants			1
there were no reported deaths in those cases , but treatment for these types of infections , which have been caused in the past by contaminated medical equipment , tend to involve long courses of antibiotics and can require new surgery to remove infected tissue and drain fluid , said dr. @entity90 , a @entity68 medical officer			0
excited : @entity7 's last @entity92 picture showed her passport and boarding pass on her way to the @entity6 ' some of these patients end up going through one or more surgeries and various travels through the medical system , ' @entity96 said			1
' they take a long time typically to get better			0
' the @entity6 , like countries such as @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 , has promoted itself as a destination for medical tourism , so - called because people will often tack on a few days at a resort after undergoing surgery			2
the main allure is much lower costs along with the promise that conditions will be on par with what a patient would encounter at home			0
in 2013 , there were more than 1,000 cosmetic procedures performed in the @entity6 , 60 percent of them on foreigners , according to the country 's @entity122			1
the @entity124 is flooded with advertisements and testimonials from people who say they have had successful procedures in the @entity6 , and an industry of ' recovery houses ' has sprung up to serve clients , along with promoters who canvass for clients in the @entity65			2
the price is often about a third of the cost in the @entity65			0
dr. @entity137 , a plastic surgeon in @entity138 , @entity139 , says he done corrective surgery on people for what he says were inferior procedures abroad			0
he warns that even if a foreign doctor is talented , nurses and support staff may lack adequate training			0
' clearly , the cost savings is certainly not worth the increased risk of a fatal complication , ' said @entity137 , past president for @entity150			0
@entity7 was referred to the @entity44 by several acquaintances in the @entity4 borough of @entity153 where she lived , said @entity30 and @entity154 , the father of the 4 - year - old daughter she left behind			1
probe : @entity7 's family are pushing for an investigation into the clinic and doctor ' supposedly , it was a high - end clinic , one of the best in the city , ' @entity154 said			1
the doctor who performed @entity7 's procedure , @entity164 , is certified by the @entity122 , but there are at least 300 surgeons performing cosmetic procedures who are not , said dr. @entity169 , the organization 's director			1
he said the government knows about the problem but has not taken any action			0
' we complain but we ca n't go after anyone because we 're not law enforcement , ' @entity174 said			0
the number of people pursuing treatment in the @entity6 does n't seem to have been affected by negative reports , including a previous @entity68 warning about a cluster of 12 infections in 2003 - 04			2
in one recent case , the @entity6 government in february closed a widely advertised clinic known as ' @entity188 , ' for operating without a license			1
prosecutors opened a criminal case after at least six women accused the clinic of fraud and negligence			0
the director , @entity196 , is free while awaiting trial			0
there was also the case of dr. @entity201			0
@entity4 prosecutors accused him of conducting examinations of women in health spas and beauty parlors in that state in 2006 - 09 without a license , then operating on them in the @entity6 , leaving some disfigured			1
@entity201 pleaded guilty to one count of unauthorized practice of medicine in october 2011 and returned to the @entity6 , where he still practices			2
in 2009 , @entity6 authorities charged dr. @entity214 with illegally practicing plastic surgery at his apartment after several women , including a local television personality , accused him of malpractice that left them with infections			2
awaiting trial , he has pleaded innocent to charges that include fraud			0
@entity225 , a lawyer hired by @entity7 's boyfriend , said he is still awaiting an autopsy report			1
because she arrived in the country late at night on a delayed flight and was on the operating table early the next morning , a main concern is whether she received an adequate medical evaluation before the procedure			2
@entity137 , the @entity139 surgeon , said sitting on a plane for several hours can cause blood to stagnate in the legs and increase the risk of an embolism			0
@entity7 paid the @entity6 clinic $ 6,300 for a combination of liposuction , tummy tuck and breast surgery			1
@entity30 said she had decided not to have the work done on her breasts and was expecting a partial refund			0
the woman , who worked as a property manager , had lost about 80 pounds about a year earlier after gastric bypass surgery			0
@entity7 was clearly excited about the procedure			2
her final post on @entity252 was a photo she took of her hands holding her passport and boarding pass for the flight from @entity4 to @entity36			0
' she wanted it so bad , ' her godmother said			0
' it felt like she was going to have a better outlook on life , getting this done			0
