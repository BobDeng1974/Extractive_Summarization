by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:03 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 09:15 est , 14 february 2013 @entity4 horse meat contaminated with the danger drug bute has been exported to @entity6 and has already been eaten or added to processed food , the @entity2 can reveal			1
details are due to be announced by ministers and the @entity10 today			2
the horses were slaughtered at an unnamed @entity4 abattoir in the last few weeks and the resulting meat was tested for the presence of the anti-inflammatory drug bute			1
but the results of the tests only came back after the meat had been shipped to the @entity19 and eaten or added to processed food			1
the revelation came as environment secretary @entity31 signalled more raids could be carried out on @entity4 firms suspected of selling contaminated meat in the coming days			1
on tuesday @entity10 officials raided a @entity37 slaughterhouse and a @entity39 factory which it claimed was passing off horse meat as beef			1
but the bute scare points to a serious loophole in the food protection regime for consumers , which has been highlighted by @entity48 ’s environment spokesman @entity47			1
the @entity10 announced last week that it would be moving to close this loophole with a new regime for horse meat			1
this new system , which only came into effect days ago , is meant to ensure that no carcass is allowed to be sold for food until the bute test results have come back as negative			1
prime minister @entity55 meets @entity57 producers and samples products at @entity59			2
seen here with pork pie maker @entity61 mr @entity55 tried a selection of pies at during @entity65 at @entity59 former agriculture minister @entity67 and his four - year - old daughter @entity66 tucking into a burger on a visit to the @entity70 in 1990 the @entity72 slaughterhouse in @entity73 , @entity37 , which was raided yesterday as part of the police inquiry into the sale of horsemeat being sold as beef while the presence of bute – phenylbutazone – is a concern , the amounts that appear in horse meat would be extremely small and unlikely to cause any ill effects			1
it is known to be able to induce blood disorders , including aplastic anaemia , in which the bone marrow stops making enough red blood cells , white blood cells and platelets			2
those with severe or very severe aplastic anaemia are at risk of life - threatening infections or bleeding			2
@entity99 is also known to cause cancer in rats , but there is no conclusive evidence for it to have the same effect in humans			2
miss @entity47 said : ‘ with every passing day this scandal seems to get wider			0
‘ i raised the problem of bute contaminated horse meat being released into the food chain with @entity111 [ farming ] ministers last month yet up until two days ago horses were still not being tested for bute and were being released for human consumption			1
‘ parliamentary answers released this week show 9,405 horses were slaughtered in the @entity4 for human consumption abroad last year			1
we must make sure horse meat is not contaminated with bute			1
’ workers handle meat at the @entity125 , one of the two units implicated in the horse meat scandal			1
@entity130 officials say the meat was properly declared and any fraud was committed elsewhere mr @entity31 entered talks with @entity135 ministers in @entity136 to try to secure mandatory labelling of the ‘ @entity138 ’ on all processed meat products , intelligence sharing between regulators , and spot checks on processors and retailers			1
after the meeting it was announced all member states should carry out 2,500 horse dna tests on processed beef products and 4,000 bute tests on horse meat during march , and publish the results in mid-april			1
mr @entity31 has put the blame for the food fraud scandal on retailers , saying : ‘ people have got to trust what they buy and the ultimate link between the quality of the products and what is marked on the label has got to be the business selling the product			0
‘ if people are being sold a product that says processed beef and get a product that contains a significant amount of horse meat , that is a fraud			1
’ @entity10 officials said they were looking at trails – where the meat went – from five slaughterhouses in the @entity4 that regularly process horses			1
mr @entity31 said tuesday ’s raids were the result of information passed to the @entity10 after contamination was first detected in @entity181 three weeks ago , and said the agency was doing ‘ methodical , painstaking work … sifting through data ’			0
@entity185 withdrew its everyday value spaghetti bolognese when it emerged that it contained horsemeat			0
the product was prepared in @entity6 ‘ we saw vigorous action yesterday , and we may well see some more action over the course of the coming few days ’ , he said			1
‘ but it ’s not very clever to give advance notice of what we are going to do in carrying out investigations that may lead to criminal prosecutions			0
’ however , he insisted processed meat on @entity4 supermarket shelves was safe to eat , and even said he would eat anything , including horse			1
‘ i ’m relaxed about it ’ , he said			0
‘ i ’m omnivorous , i ’ll eat anything			0
’ mr @entity31 said it was ‘ too early to tell ’ how many people may have eaten burgers and kebabs from the firms raided yesterday , or what chemicals could be in them			1
a police community support officer stands guard at the gate of the @entity72 slaughterhouse last week mr @entity31 described the scandal , then only linked to horse meat sent from @entity220 to @entity181 , and from @entity130 slaughterhouses to the @entity223 food company @entity222 , as an ‘ international criminal conspiracy ’			1
yesterday he said the premises raided in @entity4 were a separate issue			1
the @entity10 were ‘ working through all those involved in the slaughter of horses … and that work is carrying on , they are looking through invoices and customers lists ’ , he said			1
‘ there will be further action , depending on their investigation , ’ he said			0
he added that when the investigation was over there were likely to be ‘ lessons to be learned ’ , for the agency			0
at @entity243 ’s question time , @entity55 said it was ‘ appalling ’ and ‘ completely unacceptable ’ that consumers were buying beef products that turned out to contain horse			0
‘ i do think that this is a serious issue			0
people are genuinely worried about what they are buying at the supermarket and i really think we have got to get a grip , ’ he said			0
‘ retailers i think do bear a real responsibility here			0
‘ at the end of the day , it is they who are putting products on their shelves and have got to say that they are really clear about where that meat came from , what it was , who it was supplied by			1
it is up to them to check that and i think that is vitally important			0
’ yesterday a @entity275 meat broker , @entity274 , was named as a middleman in the horse meat scandal			2
the company bought some £ 45,000 of horse meat from a @entity130 abattoir , some of which eventually ended up in @entity4			1
by consumers affairs editor and @entity284 @entity287 business owner @entity285 , pictured yesterday in @entity288 near @entity289 , west @entity39 a @entity4 factory accused of turning horses into burgers and kebabs continued to operate yesterday despite official claims it had been shut down			1
the discovery concerning @entity287 , based near @entity289 , was further evidence of the shambles surrounding the handling of the scandal			0
on tuesday , the government ’s @entity10 announced that @entity287 and a slaughterhouse in @entity37 , which had allegedly supplied horse carcasses , had been closed			0
the abattoir is owned and run by @entity72 of @entity73 , who has a licence to shoot and slaughter unwanted or injured racehorses			0
the @entity10 issued a categorical statement , saying : ‘ the @entity10 has suspended operations at both these plants			0
’ it went on to declare that it and the police had ‘ detained all meat found and seized paperwork , including customer lists from the two companies ’			2
however , yesterday morning the owner of the @entity287 factory insisted it was ‘ business as usual ’ and accused the @entity10 of being ‘ untruthful ’			0
staff wearing hair nets were busy de- boning and cutting horse carcasses ready for export to @entity323			0
outside the plant stood large blue crates of meat of unspecified origin , with no evidence of @entity10 officials or the police on the site			2
it is housed in an anonymous - looking white - walled concrete building down a narrow country lane in the @entity336 hills			0
the factory is owned by local businessman @entity285 , 64 , a former turkey farmer who is president - elect of the local golf club			0
he was arrested in 2002 over an alleged offence of supplying meat from illegally slaughtered livestock but was never charged			1
the manager of the @entity287 plant , @entity347 , was tried at @entity348 and later acquitted			0
in a separate case , his co-defendant @entity349 was in 2004 jailed for six months for running an illegal abattoir near @entity352 , @entity353			0
@entity354 , director of operations at the @entity10 , said its raid on tuesday established that ‘ horse meat had been used as though it were beef in kebabs and burgers at that premises ’			2
@entity361 ( pictured ) was raided by police and the @entity363 but last night mr @entity364 said that while the plant did handle horse carcasses , it did not process any meat and had n’t passed it off as beef			2
denying he had been ordered to suspend production , mr @entity364 said he had only begun deboning horse meat supplied from @entity181 three weeks ago			2
‘ it is taken from here to @entity323 and i get paid for doing the cutting up , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t do kebab meat , minced meat or beef burgers			2
there is absolutely no cross contamination			0
’ mr @entity364 claimed he had only had three deliveries of cattle from the @entity73 slaughterhouse			0
locals described mr @entity364 as a ‘ colourful character ’ who had told them work at the plant – which employs 14 people – had ‘ taken off ’ after it started handling horse meat			2
later the @entity10 said : ‘ all meat on site was detained yesterday			2
this morning we confirmed in writing their licence to operate is suspended			0

the horses were slaughtered in @entity4 and tested for phenylbutazone , or bute
it is an anti-inflammatory drug that can affect human *health*
the meat has already hit @entity6 and has been eaten or processed
