@entity9 , a @entity14 winner with @entity15 and @entity16 and one of the greatest strikers of his generation , ca n’t run around like he used to but at 33 he still has the instinct and sense of timing of a genuine star			2
with eight minutes left and @entity7 lucky to be only one behind against lively @entity12 opponents , @entity24 fired in a cross from the right having stayed up from taking a corner			2
until that moment , @entity30 had dealt with @entity7 ’s threat but this time @entity9 ghosted ahead of their back line and finished with a left - foot volley from close range that typified composure and class			1
@entity9 ( 5 ) wheels away in celebration as the former @entity15 striker scores @entity7 's equalising goal against @entity30 on thursday night @entity9 holds a fist towards the @entity7 fans after scoring in a game which looked destined to end as a 1 - 0 victory for the @entity12 side the former @entity46 forward got a slight touch on a @entity24 cross , but it was enough to put @entity7 level in the 82nd minute @entity30 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity51 6 ; @entity52 7.5 , @entity53 6 , @entity54 6.5 , @entity55 6 ; @entity56 7 , @entity57 7 ( @entity58 64 6.5 ) @entity59 6 ( @entity60 83 ) @entity61 6.5 ( @entity62 71 6 ) @entity63 subs not used : @entity65 ( @entity66 ) , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 goal : @entity71 ' @entity7 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity72 5.5 , @entity73 6.5 , @entity11 5.5 , @entity24 6 ; @entity74 , @entity75 5 ; @entity76 4.5 ( @entity77 45 5.5 ) @entity78 6 , @entity79 6.5 ; @entity9 6			1
subs not used : @entity81 ( @entity66 ) , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 booked : @entity77 goal : @entity9 82 ' referee : @entity89 ( @entity90 ) 7 * player rating by @entity92 at the @entity5 manager @entity93 had given @entity9 a rare start partly because of past experience playing in the @entity96 for @entity97 — and he felt the decision paid off			1
‘ sometimes , you know what to expect when you ’ve played in a certain country			0
@entity9 knew the way the game is played in @entity12 , you have to wait for certain moments			2
i thought he was very composed and was waiting for that moment when an opportunity came			0
the finish was of the highest quality			0
’ ‘ i was surprised how well @entity30 played			2
i knew they were good but they kept their energy levels high for an hour			0
for us , the pleasing thing is how hard we had to work to get the result , which we did			0
‘ we did n’t have enough attacking play to see how good our strikers were but @entity9 has great experience in @entity120 football and if anyone was going to score , it was him			2
’ although second - best on thursday night , @entity7 are now well - placed to qualify for the knockout stages of the @entity124 , having beaten @entity125 4 - 1 in their opening group game			1
@entity93 picked a strong side to please the 400 @entity7 fans who had made a 4,800 - mile round trip to southern @entity12			1
but @entity30 were quicker and hungrier in the first hour with @entity7 goalkeeper @entity131 having to make fine saves from @entity57 and @entity52			1
@entity72 ’s luck ran out after 43 minutes though the goal was self - inflicted from an @entity7 point of view			1
@entity136 clipped a pass over @entity11 ’s head towards @entity139 and when the @entity7 skipper tried to hook the ball away he knocked it straight to @entity142 forward @entity63 , who took advantage of the gift with a cracking finish from 18 yards			1
it marked a sudden downturn in @entity11 ’s fortunes after his spectacular injury - time equaliser against @entity150 in the @entity152 derby on saturday			0
@entity93 responded quickly and threw on £ 28million record signing @entity77 at the interval for @entity76			0

it looked gloomy for @entity7 but you can never write off a team that has @entity9 up front			2
although his link - up play with @entity77 was non-existent , the @entity46 striker is still a great fox - in - the - box and when @entity24 got his delivery right , he needed no second invitation			0
it was probably more than the @entity184 deserved — but @entity77 even had a chance for a late winner , his header lacking the power to beat @entity51			0
their thoughts now turn to the @entity191 where they travel to @entity192 on sunday			0
and @entity93 must hope @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 , all injured for the trip to @entity12 , are fit enough to play a part			0
@entity12 's soldiers supporters of @entity30 get behind their team for the the @entity202 clash @entity11 attempts to get past @entity203 's @entity61 ( right ) during the second half in @entity12 @entity79 , who used to play with @entity30 goalscorer @entity63 at @entity205 , admitted : ‘ they have strengthened since i left @entity12 and looked a good team			1
‘ it is never easy to come here , after a four - and - a - half - hour flight , legs were heavy			0
but not having ideal preparation is part of @entity120 football and we have four points			0
’ one pleasing aspect for everyone was that there was no discernible racial behaviour from @entity30 fans towards @entity9 and @entity76 following recent high - profile cases in @entity12 which have seen @entity222 and @entity223 abused			1
indeed , most of the jeering from @entity30 fans fell to @entity79 because of his @entity205 connections			0
