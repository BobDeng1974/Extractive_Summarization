@entity0 were blasted today after they banned deliveries to more than 100 residents on a street following health and safety fears - over wonky paving slabs			1
residents on the @entity9 estate in @entity10 , @entity11 , are now forced to make a four - mile round trip collect their letters and parcels from a central depot			1
@entity0 postmen are refusing to deliver to @entity17 after it became a no - go zone due to ' a number of incidents involving colleagues falling and slipping '			1
resident @entity22 said the move by @entity0 has ' annoyed ' all of the residents at @entity17 yesterday home - owners on the road , which is not council - maintained as it is privately run by the residents ' association , said their mail had been delivered without a problem for 150 years and slammed @entity0 for not giving them any warning			1
the estate 's residents ' association has asked @entity0 to identify which areas need repairing but say it would cost tens of thousands of pounds to tarmac the entire stretch			1
elderly resident @entity38 , 79 , branded the move ' barmy '			0
he said : ' its health and safety gone mad			0
i 'm an old man and if i can manage the paving slabs , i 'm sure the postman can			0
' i have n't got a car and i ca n't walk four miles to fetch my post			2
' @entity0 say they suspended deliveries to the street for health and safety reasons following ' incidents ' @entity54 , 38 , who lives with his partner @entity55 and daughter @entity55 , added : ' it came out of the blue			1
' we had heard nothing at all about it and then the letter came through			0
' we were n't even warned or informed there was an issue , so we could maybe try to help put any issues right			2
' @entity0 deliver to the likes of the @entity67 and the @entity68 - we 're just @entity17 , in @entity69			1
' my daughter has hip problems and we 're waiting on a letter from the hospital			0
' i have sympathy for the postmen if they 've hurt themselves , but we do n't know what the problem is , and @entity0 have been delivering to us for years			1
' it 's a massive inconvenience for all the residents , especially the more elderly people living here			2
' a total of 40 households and over 100 residents have been affected by the ban			1
ms @entity22 said the pavement has been in the same condition since she moved in 15 years ago @entity89 , 52 , secretary of @entity90 , said : ' the letter said one postman had injured themselves a month ago , and we were told it happened again a couple of days before the letter was sent			2
' no - one had been consulted about any problems with the state of the pavements and i 'm surprised they had n't bothered to consult with us			0
' it would have been sensible for them to speak to us , and it 's bizarre @entity0 has taken this rather extreme stance			1
' the road is not slippery , our bins are emptied and post had been delivered here for a very long time			1
' luckily , i have a car and i 'm physically fit , but there are quite a few elderly residents and there 's the care home here too			2
' also , no - one seems to be able to contact the phone number attached with the letter			2
' @entity123 , 49 , who has lived on @entity17 for 15 years , added : ' it 's a very difficult situation			2
i ca n't see how our neighbourhood differs from any other neighbourhood			0
residents have slammed @entity0 for not giving them any warning about the cancellation of the service ' sweeping and cleaning is something we do as often as possible			1
we also tackle things like potholes , drainage issues and fly - tipping			0
' we are open to discussions			0
' we would be willing to pay if there were particularly problematic areas and we do that anyway , but obviously we could n't do the entirety of the paving			0
' resident @entity22 , 47 , added : ' i was extremely surprised we had not had any prior warning			0
' the pavement has been in the same condition since i moved in 15 years ago			0
' everybody 's annoyed about it			0
' a @entity0 spokesperson said : ' we have taken the decision to suspend deliveries to a small number of addresses after a number of incidents involving colleagues falling and slipping			1
' our priority is the safety of our people and we apologise to customers			0

@entity0 say they have suspended deliveries after ' a number of incidents ' which saw delivery *drivers* fall and slip on the private @entity9 road
but residents say post has been delivered for 150 years with no issues
residents claim they had no warning about the cancellation of the service
a total of 40 households and more than 100 residents are affected by the ban
