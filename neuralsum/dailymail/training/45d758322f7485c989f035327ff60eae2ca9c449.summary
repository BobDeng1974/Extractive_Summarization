by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:13 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 06:52 est , 5 february 2013 @entity2 is suing @entity3 after the comedian offered to pay out if the celebrity real estate mogul could prove his father was a homosapien and not an ape			1
in january , mr @entity3 appeared on @entity10 's show and announced that he would donate $ 5 million to charity if mr @entity2 provided evidence that he was not the ' spawn of his mother having sex with orangutan			1
' @entity2 produced his birth certificate to show both his parents were indeed human and now he is taking the comedian to court to force @entity3 to pay up			1
scroll down for @entity20 bring it : @entity3 ( left ) joked on the ' @entity22 ' in january that he would pay $ 5 million to charity if @entity2 released his birth certificate demands : @entity2 has called on @entity3 to quickly pay up on the $ 5 million he offered as a challenge on @entity10 's show , after @entity3 claimed he was the child of an orangutan ( right ) ' i do n’t know whether i will win or lose the @entity3 lawsuit but had an obligation to sue for charity , ' mr @entity2 said in a statement on monday			1
' he promised me $ 5 million for charity if i provided certain information			2
well , i provided the information			0
so today i sue @entity3 for $ 5 million for charity , ' he said , calling into ' @entity36			1
' ' i do n't think he was joking			0
he said it with venom			0
that was n't a joke			0
in fact , he was nervous when he said it ; it was a pathetic delivery			0
but he said , " i will give , " and said , " i will accept , " ' he added			0
@entity3 made his bet on ' @entity22 with @entity10 ' on january 8 , to mock @entity2 's maligned @entity49 announcement last october in which @entity2 said he would donate $ 5 million of his own money to charity if president @entity52 would release his college records			1
evidence : lawyers for @entity2 were swift to issue the property billionaire 's birth certificate - releasing it the day after @entity3 's challenge appearing on the @entity61 late night show , mr @entity3 joked about @entity2 , the host of @entity61 's @entity62			1
he suggested the multimillion dollar prize could be directed to the charity of @entity2 's choice , naming the ' @entity66 ' or ' @entity67 ' as potential recipients			1
comparing @entity2 to an orangutan , @entity3 was drawing a comparison between the famously sandy hair of the @entity73 billionaire and the great ape that roams the jungles of @entity76			2
in addition to calling @entity2 the son of an orangutan , @entity3 labeled @entity2 a ' liar ' and a ' racist ' and a ' douche bag ' as he reacted to some derogatory tweets that @entity2 had posted online about him			2
the comedian accused @entity2 of not even writing the tweets himself , but palming them off as a job to a ' syphilitic monkey			0
' monkey claim : speaking to @entity10 in january , @entity3 openly mocked @entity2 's failed attempt in october ( right ) to persuade president @entity52 to release his college and passport records but @entity2 accepted the challenge			1
shortly thereafter , @entity92 , a lawyer for @entity2 , 66 , sent the host of @entity95 's @entity94 with @entity3 a letter with the property magnate 's birth certificate attached and asked the comedian , who is estimated to be worth $ 40 million , to come up with the cash and honor his ultimatum			1
the letter came with a birth certificate attached ' demonstrating that he is the son of @entity103 , not an orangutan			2
please remit the $ 5 million to mr @entity2 immediately			1
' @entity2 indicated he wants to give $ 1 million each to charities for the @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and the @entity110			0
proof : mr @entity52 released his birth certificate in april of 2012 , to show he was indeed born in the @entity113 @entity2 had brought publicity to the ' birther ' movement , that openly questioned the legitimacy of mr @entity52 's @entity113 citizenship , during the 2012 presidential election			1
he called for the president to release his birth certificate , which mr @entity52 did in april 2012			2
even after viewing the birth certificate , showing the president was indeed born in the @entity113 - a requirement detailed in @entity123 of @entity124 of the @entity125 still expressed his doubt			2
so he announced in october that he was calling on mr @entity52 to release his college records , in addition to his passport information			0
members of the birther movement had suggested that @entity52 had attended @entity133 's @entity132 as a foreign exchange student , under the name @entity136			0
others have claimed that his @entity139 degree was funded by a foreign sponsor , @entity142 adviser @entity141 , and not financed by student loans , as mr @entity52 has oft stated			0
lol : following @entity2 's offer to pay $ 5 million to a charity of his choice , president @entity52 laughed off any suggestion that he reveal his college or passport records ' @entity52 is the least transparent president in the history of this country , ' said @entity2 in his @entity49 video released in october			1
' i 'm very honored to have gotten him to release his long - form birth certificate or whatever it may be			0
' ' if @entity52 opens up and gives his college records and application and if he gives his passport applications and records , i will give to a charity of his choice - inner - city children in @entity162 , @entity108 , aids research , anything he wants - a check immediately for $ 5 million			2
' the president did not respond to @entity2 's challenge			0
in his own appearance on @entity10 last october , mr @entity52 did joke the bad blood between himself and @entity2 stems back to an argument ' when we were growing up together in @entity172			0

@entity3 told @entity10 he would donate $ 5 million to the charity of @entity2 's choice if he released his birth certificate
real estate mogul produced the record of his birth , showing his father was human not an orangutan
@entity2 is suing @entity3 for $ 5 million
' i do n’t know whether i will win or lose the @entity3 lawsuit but had an obligation to sue for charity , ' mr @entity2 said
