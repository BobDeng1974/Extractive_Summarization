this is partly because more of us are eating croissants and pastries for breakfast and replacing lunchbox sandwiches with bagels , wraps and pittas			1
also , more shoppers are buying specialist loaves – while the popularity of breadmaking machines and tv shows such as @entity20 has led to renewed interest in home baking			0
@entity1 shoppers are shunning traditional loaves in favour of so - called healthier bread such as pitta ( pictured ) and wraps retail analysts @entity28 said sales of sliced wrapped bread dropped by 1.8 per cent – or 31million loaves – in the past year despite an overall increase in bakery sales of 3.5 per cent			1
sales of wraps , pittas and bagels soared by a sixth			0
the white sliced loaf – a @entity1 staple since the 1930s – has been criticised for its texture , high salt content and low nutritional value			2
the @entity46 said : ' not only has the mainstay of the category lost share to a new wave of bread alternatives including thins , wraps and bagels , it has also suffered from persisting negative -- and not entirely justified -- perceptions in terms of health , say commentators			0
' adding to bread ’s woes , input costs soared last year , putting pressure on margins , while one of the worst wheat harvests in history has resulted in quality so low that , in january , @entity67 was forced to renege on its commitment to use only @entity1 wheat			1

indeed nutritionist @entity97 says that there is no real health benefit to switching from white bread to pittas : ' despite what people may think , there is little nutritional difference between a white sliced loaf and a pitta bread or bagel			2
' it might taste different and add variety to your day , but it is a mistake to think making changes to the bread you buy will provide added health benefits unless you are switching from white bread to wholemeal , which is richer in fibre			0

report has shown that @entity1 is eating *30million* less loaves than a year *ago*
industry experts put this down to *consumers* seeking out ' healthier ' foods
