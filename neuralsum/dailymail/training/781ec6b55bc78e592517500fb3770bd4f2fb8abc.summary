published : 02:45 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 04:45 est , 31 july 2013 dna profiles of thousands of suspected sex offenders are being destroyed because of a legal loophole that leaves police powerless to hold them			1
from october , forces in @entity5 and @entity6 will no longer be able to hold indefinitely genetic information on people arrested on suspicion of sexual and violent crimes once they have been released without charge			2
police will be given the right to apply for data to be held for longer , but this appeal process is not yet in place , the @entity11 said			2
changes : police forces in @entity5 and @entity6 will no longer be able to retain dna profiles of people arrested on suspicion of sexual or violent crimes indefinitely despite the lack of appeal , the @entity21 has ordered forces to delete dna records ahead of the change , @entity27 says , including the details of 18,000 people arrested but not charged with rape			1
@entity27 claims forces are now following government directives to delete records in advance of the change to the law , according to the @entity11			0
the changes to the national dna database come in the @entity38 , under which dna profiles from people arrested but not charged with a serious offence such as rape should be destroyed			1
police can apply to the biometrics commissioner to hold a sample for three years , with an extension of two years , if they have the grounds to do so			2
' incompetence ' : shadow home secretary @entity48 has accused the @entity21 of ' shocking incompetence ' but this opportunity to appeal is not yet in place , despite prime minister @entity53 telling the @entity54 in 2011 that safeguards had been introduced , the @entity50 said			1
shadow home secretary @entity48 said the loophole amounted to ' shocking incompetence ' by the @entity21			1
she told @entity50 : ' it is appalling that dna evidence from thousands of rape suspects is now being destroyed , contrary to the promises made by the prime minister and the home secretary			0
' they were warned repeatedly in @entity63 and by the police about the risks involved in destroying dna evidence in this way			0
' @entity68 's failure to prevent and deal with this incompetence shows she has not taken seriously enough the risks to rape convictions and crime from her policy			0
' ms @entity48 demanded an urgent inquiry into ' how this implementation went so badly wrong ' , saying : ' we need to know if the police have been ignored or overruled by the @entity21 and why this has gone so wrong			1
' a @entity21 spokeswoman said : ' in the past , @entity57 was kept from innocent people , but not taken from prisoners			0
we are taking samples from the guilty and getting rid of them when people have done nothing wrong			0
' through the @entity38 we are restoring common sense to the system by ensuring only those convicted of a criminal offence will have their dna retained indefinitely			1
' forces will be able to retain @entity57 from someone arrested and not charged for up to three years , but only with permission from the biometrics commissioner			0
and all @entity57 samples taken by police are checked against the national database before deletion			0

dna profiles of people arrested but not charged will be destroyed
police will be able to apply for an extension *-* but system not yet in place
@entity48 said amounted to ' shocking incompetence ' by @entity21
@entity21 said it was ' restoring common sense ' to the system
