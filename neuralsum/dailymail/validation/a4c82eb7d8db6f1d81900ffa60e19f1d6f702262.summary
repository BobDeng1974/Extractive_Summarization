cabinet office minister @entity0 claimed he received ‘ darkly veiled threats ’ to drop claims that police failed to warn a young mother she was working with a dangerous paedophile who went on to abuse her son a @entity9 minister is embroiled in an explosive row with @entity12 ’s top policewoman amid claims she ‘ threatened ’ him over a child sex abuse case			1
cabinet office minister @entity0 said @entity15 , the chief constable of @entity16 , tried to stop him raising allegations of police errors in a ‘ sickening ’ paedophile scandal			1
@entity0 claimed he received ‘ darkly veiled threats ’ to drop claims that police failed to warn a young mother she was working with a dangerous paedophile who went on to abuse her son			1
and he said one of the ‘ threats ’ was made by ms @entity15			1
but ms @entity15 , said to be @entity27 ’s favourite police leader , hit back angrily last night			1
in a statement to @entity29 she rejected the allegations as ‘ unfounded ’			1
‘ i categorically deny ever making any sort of threat – veiled or otherwise – to @entity0 mp			1
’ and she said the claims entitled her to sue him for libel			0
the clash involves a woman who worked as a carer for two disabled children			2
she did not know their father , @entity41 , was on the @entity43			0
he was supposed to be monitored by @entity16			2
but the woman claims police blundered by failing to alert her to his paedophile record			2
@entity41 was subsequently jailed for life after abusing her young son 25 times in six months			2
mr @entity0 , who is the woman ’s local mp in @entity53 , offered to raise her case in the @entity55 in 2008			1
but he says police tried to stop him			0
‘ there were all sorts of darkly veiled threats if i went head - to - head and toe - to - toe with @entity16 , ’ he said			1
‘ i had phone calls from at least two members of the force who rang me up directly about this and tried to stop me raising it in @entity68 , even though it was quite clearly the right thing to do			0
‘ they said things like “ really , mr @entity0 ? so early on in your @entity78 career ? do you want to make an error about getting involved in raising this issue ? there may be more to this than meets the eye			2
you could be getting into a very difficult situation			0
” ’ the @entity29 has confirmed that mr @entity0 claims ms @entity15 was one of those who tried to deter him			1
he said he had raised the case not to attack the police but to highlight concerns about how his constituent – who can not be named as she has a legal right to anonymity – had been dealt with			0
he said : ‘ i wonder whether there is something systemic within the police , that , where difficult personal cases are involved , they do n’t want to get involved			0
’ but ms @entity15 , who is next month set to become the boss of the new @entity94 ’ council , said : ‘ such allegations are unfounded and libellous			1
i will be writing to mr @entity0 directly to seek clarification on exactly what he has alleged			2
‘ i am extremely concerned that such serious allegations , relating to alleged events over six years ago , now appear to have been made via the media and not with the force directly via any formal complaint , either at the time of the case in 2006 or at any point since			0
’ but defiant mr @entity0 last night stood by his claims			2
he criticised ms @entity15 for threatening to sue him and claimed she was continuing to try to stop the matter being discussed openly			1
he told @entity29 : ‘ i absolutely stand by my comments			0
the purpose was to draw attention to the fact that mistakes had been made by @entity16 in the past			0
' unfounded ' : @entity116 chief constable @entity15 has categorically denied making any threats ‘ it is very disappointing that @entity15 is making legal threats which will prevent proper open discussion			1
from the very beginning i have sought transparency and openness and it is a shame that the police are still seeking to close down a reasonable and honest debate			0
‘ my intention is to ensure that should similar cases arise in the future , they are dealt with properly			0
’ mr @entity0 previously led criticism of the @entity130 for failing to report the @entity132 sex abuse scandal			2
last year he was promoted to the @entity133 where he is responsible for the @entity134 into the @entity135			0
his differences with ms @entity15 follow criticism of @entity16 over the way it handled the @entity141 child sex scandal in which as many as 373 children could have been targeted for sex by gangs of men over the last 16 years			1
earlier this month , ms @entity15 repeated an apology to victims and their families after an official review found the force had made mistakes			1
mr @entity0 said he referred obliquely to the conduct of police when he defied the alleged ’ threats ’ and raised the matter in a @entity55 debate in 2008 when he said he was there ‘ to represent my constituents without fear and favour			1
’ in a @entity130 interview , the mother whose child was abused by @entity41 claimed police had placed his human rights over their duty to her child			0
she said : ‘ they told me he had human rights			0
and i said what about my human rights ? what about my son ’s human rights ? i had the right to protect my son			0

cabinet office minister @entity0 claim to receive ‘ darkly veiled threats ’
says he tried to raise concerns about mother not told about a paedophile
the man , who she worked with , went on to abuse the young woman *'s* son
@entity16 chief constable @entity15 told him to drop it
