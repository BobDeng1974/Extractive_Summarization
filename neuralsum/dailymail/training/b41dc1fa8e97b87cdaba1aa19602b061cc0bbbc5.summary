by @entity0 when suffering a mid-life crisis , most men consider buying a sports car or signing up for the gym			1
but married it consultant @entity5 , 50 , decided instead to act out his life long dream - headlining his own rock concert			1
the father - of - two , from @entity10 in @entity11 , spent £ 26,000 on the gig at the @entity13 so he could perform in front of 2,000 friends with his band , @entity16 , to mark his 50th birthday			2
scroll down to see video star : the father - of - two spent £ 26,000 renting out the venue and setting it up for the gig for his 50th birthday the goal was to follow in the footsteps of global names who have played there before , such as @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
however , it was a daunting task for mr @entity5 , who , with his disco tribute act , normally plays in front of a feeble crowd of around 100 people			2
he spent two years planning and organising the event and faced the prospect of a huge financial loss if his dream failed			1
it costs £ 12,000 to hire the venue and , on top of this , mr @entity5 and @entity16 would have to pay for all of the lighting , sound and cost of publicising the event			1
this came to more than £ 26,000			2
despite never having done anything like this before , the band managed to sell more than 1,600 tickets at £ 18 each before giving around 400 to charities to give away			2

he said : ' my 50th birthday was on the horizon and i wanted to do something special , and slightly silly			0
' so in may 2012 i approached the @entity76 and they were super helpful			0
' i asked the manager if anyone had done this before and he just gave me a look , but i saw this as a challenge and it spurred me on			0
preparation : mr @entity5 , who lives in @entity10 , @entity11 , spent two years planning the concert ' when you hire out the @entity76 , you simply get an empty room			1
you have to sort out the sound , the lighting , the tickets and promotion			2
it took over mine and my wife @entity94 ’s lives			0
' i did n’t have £ 26,000 to lose so it was a big risk but we took a leap of faith and managed to break even which was a real achievement			2

strangely , when it got to the performance i was really relaxed about it			0
' there was a huge build - up but it ended up going really well			0
everyone was up on their feet dancing			0
' the biggest thing was the organisation , going out there and performing felt like the easy thing			0
i went out on stage and the crowd sang happy birthday and then i played			0
