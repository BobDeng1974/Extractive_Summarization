a grinning , chuckling @entity1 stood alongside president @entity2 on friday morning , accepting praise that has eluded her throughout @entity4 's troubled early months			1
only 10 days ago , the president ignored her as he took a victory lap when the @entity4 's signup numbers crested above 7 million			1
but he had kind words for the health insurance warrior in her final public appearance as a federal government employee			1
she told him ' in early march ' that she would leave shortly after the april 1 insurance open - enrollment deadline			2
but on march 31 , she told @entity14 that she would remain on the job until november			2
now that she 's no longer @entity2 's ham - fisted insurance surrogate , plagued with ' oops ' moments in one congressional hearing after another , it 's smiles all around			1
@entity1 and her team ' got the job done ' with @entity4 , he said of the manager who bungled the most ambitious health initiative in @entity28 history , and ' the final score speaks for itself			1
' the president praised her for ' five years of extraordinary service to our country			0
' ' i will miss her advice , i will miss her friendship , i will miss her wit , ' he said			1
even her farewell speech had its panic moment			0
' a page is missing , ' @entity1 said before improvising the end of her remarks			1
@entity2 's well - wishes included moments of @entity4 crescendo , but equal time for other liberal identity - politics totems			1
she ' has been here through the long fight to pass the @entity4 , ' @entity2 said			1
' she helped guide its implementation even when it got rough			0
' but @entity1 , @entity2 said , had also ' reduced racial and ethnic disparities ' in @entity28 ' well - being , and was ' a tireless advocate for women 's health			1
' @entity76 , who heads the @entity40 , was nominated to take her place			2
@entity2 appeared with the outgoing and incoming @entity31 secretaries in the @entity79 , shortly before jetting off for fundraisers , and a speech to @entity83 's @entity82 , in @entity84			1
@entity1 ' replacement is @entity76 , a long - time @entity86 operative whose political career has come in two acts with a lengthy intermission			1
@entity39 served in the @entity90 as deputy to then - budget director @entity92 , who would later become @entity2 's treasury secretary			1
she was briefly ensnared in an investigation into the suicide death of deputy white house counsel @entity96			0
as @entity99 agents scoured @entity96 's office for clues about why he took his life , @entity39 briefly sifted through a ' burn bag ' containing classified documents that she was n't supposed to see			0
after a stint as deputy chief of staff during the @entity110 crisis , she went to the private sector , first at the @entity112 and later at the top of the @entity115 foundation , the mega-retail chain 's charitable arm – only to succumb again to @entity117 's lure			0
the @entity118 confirmed her last year to run @entity40 , by a 96 - 0 margin			1
oops ! ' a page is missing , ' @entity1 said , skipping a portion of her speech in the final cock - up of her time at @entity31 lean forward : @entity2 hopes to wipe the @entity4 slate clean with a new quarterback , but @entity118 @entity127 will likely turn her confirmation hearing into an license to fish for new information about the unpopular policy the timing of @entity1 ' departure was designed to allow her to leave with a scrap of honor , coming just a week after @entity2 announced that his administration had exceeded its target of 7 million enrollees after months of fiasco			1
@entity2 brought past and future @entity31 secretaries to a @entity79 event attended by officials including @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 she ' has been here through the long fight to pass the @entity4 , ' @entity2 gushed			1
' she helped guide its implementation even when it got rough			0
i 've got bumps , and bruises			0
' the @entity36 aims for her resignation to soften the constant barrage of controversies connected with the president 's flagship policy			2
republicans were quick to pounce thursday , confounding those hopes			0
' @entity1 had a supremely difficult job implementing a law as unpopular and unwieldy as @entity4 , ' @entity171 chair rep. @entity170 said in a statement			1
' her tenure as the head of the @entity31 may be at an end , but @entity28 will be dealing with the repercussions of the president 's health law for a very long time			2
' on the @entity118 side of the @entity181 , minority leader @entity179 called it ' fitting that nearly one year after the primary legislative architect of @entity4 predicted it would be a train wreck that the government official most responsible for overseeing it reportedly is resigning			1
' ' regardless of the administration ’s public explanation for the secretary ’s exit , @entity4 has been a rolling disaster and her resignation is cold comfort to the millions of @entity28 who were deceived about what it would mean for them and their families			2
' the train - wreck reference was a nod to former montana democratic sen. @entity200 , now @entity2 's ambassador to @entity201 , who warned @entity1 on april 17 , 2013 that the @entity4 was headed for the rocks			1
' i just see a huge train wreck coming down , " he said then			0
' you and i have discussed this many times , and i do n't see any results yet			0
' @entity209 vu : 13 months ago @entity2 introduced @entity76 in the @entity210 of the @entity36 as him new budget director the @entity4 has been fraught with trouble since its official rollout in october			1
its website crashed , cost estimates quickly rose , and public dissatisfaction has dogged the initiative for more than two years			0
the october 1 online unveiling was nothing short of disastrous , with even liberal commentators and @entity86 in @entity221 conceding that the government 's effort was not ready for prime time			0
contractors ' efforts were incompatible , data servers were inadequate , and payment systems linked to the website were yet to be built on launch day			0
@entity1 joined the @entity2 administration in april 2009 as a figure unknown to @entity28 in 49 states			1
she had been governor of @entity234 from 2003 to 2009 , and that state ; s insurance commissioner for eight years before that			0
her only national platform prior to @entity2 's election came in 2008 when , as a former chair of the @entity241 , she was tapped to deliver her party 's response to president @entity244 's final @entity246 address			2
she was n't expected to play a role in the new administration until former sen. @entity249 , a @entity250 politician who had once been @entity251 , withdrew his candidacy for the top @entity31 job following a tax scandal			2
he had failed to pay taxes on more than $ 83,000 in earnings in 2007 , and claimed tax deductions for nearly $ 15,000 of donations to charities that did n't meet the @entity261 's tax - deductibility standards			2
@entity1 has n't said where she will go after she leaves the president 's cabinet			2
her three immediate predecessors have found life after government as a law partner ( @entity269 ) , a university professor ( @entity271 ) and a think - tank chief ( @entity272 )			0
none of them , however , presided over a program that , like @entity4 , was controversial , partisan and fraught with failure from the beginning			0
@entity1 presided over all of it , producing misgivings across the @entity28 capital that she was up to the task			0
she has , however , been the administration 's designated spear - catcher , attracting slings and arrows from both houses of @entity221 and the public at every turn			0
the president raised eyebrows nationwide on april 1 when he failed to acknowledge her contribution to the program 's recent momentum during a high - profile @entity79 victory speech			2
@entity1 , who has served in @entity2 's cabinet for five years , was not there alongside him but sat , unnoticed , in the front row			1
as the @entity36 shifted from shame to fist - pumping , @entity1 continued to attract scorn			1
she said during a @entity302 hearing on thursday that more than 7.5 million @entity28 had chosen health insurance plans through the @entity4 system			0
she could not , however , answer a question from @entity307 sen. @entity306 about how many subscribers were uninsured before the law took effect			0
additionally , she has n't provided @entity221 with answers about how many @entity4 enrollees have paid premiums , a necessary step to become formally enrolled in insurance plans			0
a recent @entity317 study estimated that no more than 1 million @entity28 both lacked insurance before the rollout and have paid money into the system			0
although @entity86 will likely have more than enough votes to confirm @entity39 as @entity31 secretary , more than a half - dozen liberals facing difficult re-election fights will be forced to moderate their enthusiasm			1
public hearings could become a spectacle of republicans demanding internal documents and the @entity36 claiming executive privilege			0
at the least , the confirmation process will bring to the surface once again conservatives ' objections to @entity2 's new insurance model			2
' the president does n't need more @entity4 controversy so close to november , ' a senior aide to a @entity118 @entity127 told @entity341 shortly after the announcement of @entity1 ' departure			1
' and if @entity127 object too much to @entity39 , the @entity86 will trot out the " war on women " narrative even more			0
we do n't need that in an election year			0

' i will miss her advice , i will miss her friendship , i will miss her wit , ' @entity2 said as his outgoing @entity31 secretary grinned and *laughed*
in her final act as a federal government employee , @entity1 fumbled her speech when a page went missing
only days ago , @entity2 snubbed her as he claimed credit for *boosting* @entity4 's enrollment numbers
@entity1 claimed less than two weeks ago that she would remain in her job at least until november
new @entity31 secretary nominee is @entity76 , the @entity36 budget director whom the @entity118 confirmed last year , 96 - 0
