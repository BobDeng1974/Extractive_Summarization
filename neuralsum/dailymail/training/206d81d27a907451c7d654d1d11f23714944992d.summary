a new book claims that where you sit in a restaurant can affect how many calories you consume			2
@entity10 author professor @entity9 , director of @entity12 's @entity11 , says that those who sit at high - top tables or in well - lit areas make healthier menu choices			1
it is one of a vast number of observations made by his team in a study of 27 restaurants across the @entity24 pick your table wisely : sitting by a window in a restaurant can encourage you to make healthier menu choices the researchers measured and mapped the layout of each restaurant and then used meal checks to track what diners ordered and how it related to where they sat. the results were telling : people sitting farthest from the front door ate the fewest salads and were 73 per cent more likely to order dessert			1
those seated at a dark table or booth ate heavier food and ordered more of it , while diners seated at high - top bar tables ordered more salads and fewer desserts			2
' the darker it is , the more " invisible " you might feel , the less easy it is to see how much you 're eating and the less conspicuous or guilty you might feel , ' professor @entity9 explains in the book			1
in contrast , ' seeing the sunlight , people or trees outside might make you more conscious of how you look , might make you think about walking or might prompt a green salad			0
' and if there are tv sets in the restaurant , steer clear			0
professor @entity9 found that the closer a table was to a screen , the more fried food the diners ordered			1
another study featured in the book saw professor @entity9 's team study diners at 11 @entity72 buffets across the @entity24 over the course of two months			1

@entity10 : the book describes ' simple actions you can take to become permanently slimmer without really working at it ' where they chose to sit varied dramatically too - 73 per cent of slim diners faced away from the buffet while overweight diners were three times more likely to sit facing the buffet			2
professor @entity9 believes this helped qualify their decision to go back for seconds , thirds or fourths			2
' every time they saw someone take another lap around the stir fry , it reminded them that was " normal " behavior , ' he writes			0
the researchers also noted that slim diners chewed around 15 times per mouthful , three chews more than heavier diners			0
by eating more slowly , the diner consumes less in the time it takes for the brain to register satiety			0
