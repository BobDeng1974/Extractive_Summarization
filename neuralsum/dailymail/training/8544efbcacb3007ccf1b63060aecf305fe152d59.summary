it was after @entity2 ’s incendiary 121 off 74 balls in the lord ’s one - day international against @entity4 in may that @entity5 announced his limited - overs wicketkeeper was ‘ not ready ’ for @entity7			1
self - effacingly , @entity2 agreed			1
but after more mishaps with the gloves yesterday from @entity11 , attitudes might have changed			0
the 32 - year - old @entity11 is a warhorse of @entity13 , well - liked by colleagues and with a proud record as a counter-attacking @entity16			2
under pressure : doubts have been cast on @entity11 's position as @entity22 's no 1 wicketkeeper after a number of missed catches in the first test with @entity26 at @entity27 beaten : a shot from @entity26 's @entity29 finds its way past the dive of prior on day four of the first test at @entity27 the competition : there have been calls for @entity2 ( left ) , @entity22 's short form wicketkeeper , to replace prior in the team after being dropped for the last two tests of the @entity40 debacle , he was recalled against @entity4 at @entity41 and responded with a punchy 86			1
named @entity22 ’s @entity42 in may 2013 , prior had apparently refound his zest			2
since then , though , things have threatened to unravel			0
it ’s hard to be over-critical of his batting : he alone held on during @entity22 ’s first - innings collapse against @entity4 at @entity50 , and on friday here in @entity52 he fell victim to a dismal piece of umpiring from @entity56			1
but his glovework is another matter			0
the alarm bells began to ring at @entity50 , where @entity11 dropped @entity60 on 27 shortly after lunch on a chaotic first day			0
the catch was so straightforward that @entity64 was halfway through a celebratory leap when prior allowed the ball , which he did n’t realise had been pinned to his chest by his gloves , to plop to earth			0
disappointed : prior could only make five runs in @entity22 's innings , which was rescued by an unlikely last wicket stand between @entity73 and @entity74 appealed : @entity26 wicketkeeper @entity75 successfully pleads the wicket of @entity11 off the bowling of @entity78 heroic : @entity74 set a world record on saturday as he and @entity73 formed a final wicket partnership of 198 to rescue @entity22 on the fourth day of the first test with @entity26 at @entity27 in @entity52 if there was a touch of misfortune about that , then his wicketkeeping in this @entity7 has done little to quell fears the @entity88 trouble which limited him to one early - season championship match for @entity91 is not evidence of irreversible wear and tear			1
even ahead of this game , @entity2 was called up as cover because prior was experiencing tightness in his right thigh			2
prior allayed fears with a smart catch to his left to see off @entity26 opener @entity102 on wednesday morning , but has since missed three chances low to his right : @entity75 was dropped on 50 on the second morning , and on saturday afternoon he twice failed to lay a glove on chances offered by @entity108			1
whether @entity2 would have snaffled them may no longer be the point			2
he is 23 , full of drive and invention , and is averaging 40 for struggling @entity113			0
he is just the sort of cricketer , in other words , who might fit neatly into the template of a brave new era .			0

prior 's glovework is becoming a cause for concern , with several missed chances against @entity26
his batting *remains* beyond *reproach* , though he only made five in @entity22 's innings at @entity27
@entity2 , @entity22 one - day wicketkeeper , is *waiting* for his test chance
