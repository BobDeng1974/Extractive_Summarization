a young fisherman in @entity1 reeled in the catch of the day after hooking a fish with a plastic toy fishing rod – but was the achievement just a hoax ? captured standing on the bank of what appears to be a lake , the youngster – with a big grin on his face – holds onto a tiny blue and yellow fishing rod			1
approaching the water , the young boy reels rapidly , but at this point it is n’t clear whether or not he has hooked anything			1
the youngster stands on the bank of what appears to be a lake and holds a tiny blue and yellow fishing rod he then crouches down by the side of the water and moves his rod from side to side – tension on the end of it is now visible			1
fighting against what may well be a weed , the young boy continues to reel and before long a fish breaks the surface of the water			1
as it splashes about , the youngster puts his hand into the lake and plucks it out			0
he then lays it on the floor before confidently putting his finger in its mouth , removing the hook and proudly lifting it up to the camera			0
the young @entity47 boy crouches down by the side of the water and moves his rod from side to side while reeling discussing the video with @entity52 , @entity53 of @entity1 , said that the fish was most likely a @entity55 , although it is hard to see exactly from the clip			1
he added : ‘ they are found in almost every river , lake or pond right through the whole of @entity1 and were introduced back in 1967 as a gift from @entity65 to the @entity66			2
‘ many people farm them in small numbers in their ponds for food			0
the fry can be bought for about 8p each			0
