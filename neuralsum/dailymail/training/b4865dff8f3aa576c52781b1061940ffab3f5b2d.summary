if @entity1 needed a reminder of how cruel the @entity3 can be , this was it			2
@entity4 could have been 2 - 0 up at half time against @entity6 , but seven minutes into the second half they were on their way to defeat thanks to @entity11 ’s winner			1
chester - escaping the attentions of debutant @entity13 in the process - headed home the only goal of the afternoon as @entity18 's side got their season up and running			1
and to compound @entity4 's misery , @entity20 missed a late penalty for @entity1 's side as their latest top - flight journey began with defeat			1
they now head to @entity59 on thursday for a @entity61 tie with @entity62 @entity4 : ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) @entity63 6.5 ; @entity64 6.5 , @entity13 6.5 , @entity65 6.5 ( @entity66 78 ) ; @entity67 5.5 ( @entity68 68 , 6 ) , @entity69 6.5 , @entity70 6.5 , @entity71 6.5 ( @entity72 68 , 6 ) ; @entity73 5.5 ; @entity28 6.5 , @entity74 6 substitutes not used : @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 booked : @entity65 @entity6 : ( 3 - 5 - 1 - 1 ) @entity47 7.5 ; @entity37 7.5 , @entity18 6.5 ( @entity79 46 , 6.5 ) , @entity80 7 ; @entity81 7 , @entity82 8 ; @entity33 7 , @entity83 7 , @entity84 6 ( @entity34 40 , 7.5 ) ; @entity85 6.5 ( @entity86 82 ) ; @entity35 6 substitutes not used : @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 scorer : @entity37 52 booked : @entity80 , @entity35 referee : @entity93 attendance : 17,603 @entity95 : @entity82 ‘ some days it does n’t go with you , if we score the penalty we could have won the game — that ’s how close it was , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ i felt we played better today than the majority of the @entity104 season last year , we will only get better			0
’ @entity13 made his @entity4 debut , playing as the sweeper in @entity1 's new - look 3 - 5 - 2 formation			1
alongside him was @entity108 , who was making his return to the top - flight , and @entity64 , who was making his first competitive start for @entity4 following his move from @entity113			0
@entity69 , also an arrival from @entity113 , made his debut but @entity1 did n't include loan signing @entity116 who is still receive international clearance			0
striker @entity28 , who spent lost season on loan at @entity121 , also started for @entity4 after his protracted moves to @entity123 and @entity124 fell through			1
there were also three debutantes for @entity6 , @entity82 , @entity84 and @entity85 all making their bows for @entity18 's side			2
both club 's started with the ' on - trend ' 3 - 5 - 2 system ; @entity13 assuming the role as sweeper in the heart of @entity4 's defence			1
but it was @entity6 that looked comfortable as they dominated the opening exchanges			0
@entity35 glanced a header wide from @entity82 's deep cross before the home side struggled to deal with @entity84 ' inswinging corner			2
slowly but surely , though , @entity1 's men eased their way back into @entity3 life			1
@entity20 just failed to find @entity69 during a rapid @entity4 break , before @entity146 fired narrowly wide in the 17th minute after a period of sustained pressure from the top - flight new - boys			2
@entity20 did find @entity69 five minutes later after @entity6 keeper @entity47 went walkabout - but @entity4 's summer signing completely missed his kick from 14 yards out			1
@entity80 was booked in the 27th minute for a crude foul on @entity28 , who turned the defender on the edge of the box , only for @entity70 - captaining the side in @entity75 's absence - to fire wide			1
new addition : referee @entity93 uses the vanishing spray recently introduced to the @entity3 to mark out a line for @entity6 's wall in the book : referee @entity93 brandishes a yellow card to @entity80 of @entity6 as @entity84 protests @entity164 miles @entity4 total 112.8 70.1 @entity70 90 12.3 7.6 @entity69 90 12.3 7.6 @entity28 90 10.9 6.8 @entity6 total 117.1 72.8 @entity165 90 12.1 7.5 @entity35 90 11.8 7.3 @entity33 90 11.6 7.2 @entity69 then missed a glorious chance to score @entity4 's first goal of the season , but he could only head wide from eight yards after @entity28 's excellent cross			1
and the home side could easily have been punished for their wastefulness seconds later when @entity73 clumsily bundled @entity35 over in the box , but referee @entity93 waved away @entity6 's appeals			2
@entity4 were fortunate , and @entity13 knew it , as he gave @entity73 an earful immediately after the incident			0
@entity84 ' début came to an abrupt end in the 40th minute , a knee injury ending his afternoon			2
and it nearly got worse for last season 's @entity181 finalists after @entity64 's bullet header from @entity70 's inswinging corner was cleared off the line by @entity82 before @entity47 tipped the loose ball over the bar			2
on balance , a goal would n't have flattered @entity4 , who after a slow start got to grips with the @entity3 pretty quickly			0
but , as is life in the big - time , @entity4 paid the consequences for the wastefulness as @entity6 took a 52nd minute lead			0
@entity34 's inswinging corner was headed past @entity63 by @entity37 after the @entity6 defender escaped the attentions of @entity13 at the back post			1
if @entity1 needed a reminder of how cruel the @entity3 is , then that was it			0
and @entity6 should have doubled their lead in the 62nd minute after a flowing break , but @entity85 could only fire straight at @entity63 with just the keeper to beat after brilliant work from @entity34			0
@entity1 introduced @entity72 and @entity68 to stem the visitors ' impetus - but the chances kept coming for @entity6			0
watching on : @entity4 first team coach @entity211 ( left ) takes in the match from the stands at @entity32 instructions : @entity1 is animated in the home technical area as he bellows out the orders to his team stop him : @entity84 , making his @entity3 debut for @entity6 , tries to stop @entity71 sliding in : @entity80 of @entity6 sticks his leg out to try and rob @entity4 's @entity28 of possession on balance , a goal would n't have flattered @entity4 , who after a slow start got to grips with the @entity3 pretty quickly			1

first , @entity85 forced @entity63 into another save in the 70th minute , the @entity4 keeper palming his fierce free kick behind before the @entity6 forward was thwarted again , this time by @entity65 's timely block			2
@entity35 saw his volley from @entity34 's corner deflected over in the 74th minute as @entity6 squandered another opportunity			1
and with every passing chance , @entity18 was getting twitchier			0
so , it would have come as no surprise to the @entity6 boss when referee @entity93 pointed to the spot in the 83rd minute after @entity37 handled substitute @entity72 's attempted cross			0
commanding : @entity13 jumps highest to beat @entity6 striker @entity35 to the ball in the air on his debut appearance for @entity4 aerial tussle : @entity71 goes up with @entity6 's @entity165 in a battle to win the ball under pressure : @entity69 of @entity4 attempts to try and get away from @entity6 's @entity33 during the first - half of the match but @entity4 's first half deficiencies were laid bare again when @entity74 's 84th minute penalty was superbly saved by @entity47			1
that just about summed up @entity4 's afternoon			0
@entity1 's side tried to muster a late onslaught , @entity28 and substitute @entity66 wasting good chances as @entity6 held on for victory			1
@entity18 was satisfied with the result as he set out @entity6 's target for @entity3 survival			2
‘ that ’s one win down , we just need to get another nine , ’ said @entity18			0
' ten wins is usually enough to keep you up			0
