by @entity1 reporter published : 10:55 est , 2 june 2013 updated : 10:55 est , 2 june 2013 are double @entity2 about to go the way of the dodo ? that 's what @entity6 is hoping , now that the company has introduced @entity9 , based on a brand new sizing system focused on breast volume rather than the rigid cup and band measurement system currently used in the industry			1
instead of the typical a , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , etc , cup , @entity6 's @entity15 measures the volume and shape of a woman 's breast plus an under - bust measurement , with the volumetric sizes running from 1 through to 10			1
the new system has 55 size combinations , and promises to address the long - bemoaned problem of ill - fitting bras			1
@entity31 sizes currently are based on two measurements - the breast at its fullest point , minus the rib cage measurement			1
if it ’s a one - inch difference , it ’s an a cup ; a two - inch difference , a b cup , and so on			0
@entity6 says this equation does n’t account for volume and different breast shapes			1
good fit : @entity6 's new @entity42 comes with 10 plastic cups , a measuring tape and instructions on how to find your perfect bra size bra sizes also vary widely from one manufacturer to the next , and from country to country , and women 's bodies and breasts often do n't conform to the arbitrary sizes offered by companies			2
these are the problems @entity6 is seeking to solve			0
' it took us eight years to develop the new @entity6 bra and its revolutionary @entity15 , ' said @entity61 , @entity6 's senior vice president of design , research and development			1
' through our research , and countless hours of testing and talking with women , we are confident we are answering women 's desire for the perfect - fitting bra			0
' patented : the @entity70 ( left ) and the @entity71 are two of the options in @entity6 's new @entity75 range and have a patented @entity77 contour design that does away with underwires soft support : the @entity80 ( left ) and the @entity81 have ' unique @entity82 for a revolutionary soft cup ' that has no underwire and great support the @entity15 can be ordered from @entity86 for $ 19.95 which can be redeemed as a $ 19.95 discount off the price of a bra			1
it comes in a small mesh bag and contains 10 plastic molded cups in different sizes , a measuring tape and a booklet of instructions and bra styles			1
women using the system should select a cup that looks closest to their size and place it over their breast			0
the cup that fits is the one with the best coverage , with no gaps or ' spillage ' cups runneth over : jockey 's new bra fitting system lets women measure themselves to find their perfect fit using 10 different - sized plastic cups - if there are gaps , it 's too big , if there is spillage , it 's too small next , use the color - coded measuring tape to take a direct measurement of the under - bust area			1
there are seven different band sizes ( 30 , 32 , 34 , 36 , 38 , 40 or 42 )			0
price point : like the entire @entity75 range , the @entity123 retails for $ 60 the new measuring system would result in sizes such as 1 - 30 , 7 - 36 and 9 - 42			0
jockey says that in contrast with the 80 - year - old alphanumeric measuring system which is a pure mathematical equation , the new system takes into account the volume of a woman 's breast rather than just her measurements			2
bra shopping is notoriously traumatic , with research showing 75 per cent of women have trouble finding a bra that fits properly and a staggering 85 per cent are wearing the wrong sized bra			0
' women also dislike the bra shopping experience due to the overwhelming number of bra choices , lack of attentive service , and complexity and variance of proper sizing , ' says the @entity6 website			2
according to research on @entity6 's website , 53 per cent of women have never been professionally fitted for a bra			0
the @entity155 themselves come in five different styles so far : @entity71 , @entity123 , @entity158 , classic - @entity31 and @entity159 and they each come in black , white and nude colors			0
jockey has also pledged not to discontinue any of its bra styles			2
the @entity155 come with a patented ' @entity166 support ' replacing the underwire , which ' supports , cups and shapes the breast without any poking , giving women an exceptionally comfortable fit '			0
mission impossible : many women dread bra shopping due to the ' overwhelming number of bra choices , lack of attentive service , and complexity and variance of proper sizing ' , according to @entity6 bra cup sizes as we know them were invented in 1932 , and band sizes became popular in the 1940s			2
the sizes have barely changed since then , though the range has expanded along with the general population 's weight			0
the originator of the bra was @entity193 , who received a @entity195 patent on 21 november 1911 for a bra with soft cups and a metal band supporting and separating the breasts			0
with a price tag of $ 60 , it remains to be seen whether or not the @entity9 and sizing system will catch on , but new adopters can rest assured that the company has a money - back satisfaction guarantee on its new bras			1
