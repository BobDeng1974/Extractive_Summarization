@entity0 and @entity1 stole the show on monday as a number of stunning revelations were released from their respective must - read autobiographies			1
in response , @entity8 's top team of reporters have had a look at their bookcases and picked out some of their favourite sports reads of all time			1
@entity15 a life @entity17 : the tragedy of @entity19 ( @entity20 ) a @entity21 is both a desperate tragedy and the most extraordinary piece of writing			2
it will also act as an antidote to the froth , nonsense and self importance of @entity1			1
early indications are that @entity1 has confused settling scores in what amounts to a playground argument as a substantial issue			1
a @entity21 chronicles @entity36 international goalkeeper @entity19 's battle with mental illness and his eventual suicide			1
friend and journalist @entity40 was allowed access to his private diaries to complete the work			2
i doubt there has ever been a sports book as moving or profound			1
a life @entity17 tales @entity36 international @entity19 's battle with mental illness and his eventual suicide @entity50 this one 's on me ( @entity52 ) twenty - four years before @entity54 's greatest striker released a second glossy autobiography @entity52 , he co-wrote a book that charted his life and career , from sporting icon to helpless alcoholic , with quite remarkable frankness and absence of self - pity			1
@entity52 was between a glittering footballer career and becoming a genuine television star as one half of @entity68 at the time of publication of @entity64 's on me in 1979			1
it was an eye - opener for any fan who wanted to know what it was really like to be top - class player			2
he wrote about being a golden boy with @entity78 and @entity79 , life as an early football expat in @entity82 , being frozen out of the @entity84 final and his friendship with @entity86			2
and the alcoholism that nearly killed him			2
unlike @entity88 or @entity89 , he refused to blame stardom or the media for his problems , which makes the book all the more fascinating			1
@entity52 ' first autobiography is a remarkably frank piece into the life of a top - class footballer @entity98 the @entity99 ( @entity100 ) like most good sports books the miracle of @entity102 provides essential truths far beyond the pure subject matter			1
in this case it is about a small town football team from an unfashionable part of @entity82 and their unlikely rise to @entity111 the characters are richly portrayed and it takes you into a part of the world , sporting and geographically , that is rarely touched			2
author @entity100 , who died last year , also got lucky in that unexpected events only add to an already extraordinary tale			2
a very fine book that avoids so many of the usual football clichés			1
the miracle of @entity102 ( left ) and i am @entity124 ( right ) both make our writers ' picks @entity128 i am @entity124 ( @entity124 ) coruscating from the very first words on his fallout with @entity133 , this is a book that burrows into the veins of the football industry as much as life growing up in an immigrant family			1
@entity139 , funny , and fascinating to the last , his voice projects from the page and even his agent @entity142 is not spared from killer put downs			2
a real insight into one of the best minds to take to a pitch			2
@entity148 behind the curtain : travels in @entity151 ( @entity152 ) this is probably the only book i still pick up and reread the occasional chapter			1
part history lesson , part travelogue , the subject – previously unchartered territory to my knowledge – and its characters are fascinating , some triumphant , many more tragic			2
i ’ve always been intrigued by football in @entity163 , probably because of @entity166 ’s @entity165 win in 1991 , and this book feeds that hunger with a brilliant collection of anecdotes			1
i recently re-read the chapter on @entity172 and the fall of @entity174 when travelling through the country with the voice of @entity177 depicting the horror of war and subsequent rise of their football team			2
it ’s witty , entertaining and informative			2
just a very good read			2
@entity152 's ' @entity185 ' looks at eastern @entity187 football during the era of the @entity189 @entity190 unusual for me that my favourite two football books centre on a man who failed so abjectly as manager of super @entity194			1
provided you do n't @entity195 : 20 years with @entity197 ( @entity198 ) @entity198 ’s glorious account working with @entity197 every single day for two decades			0
@entity198 was the @entity200 ’s football correspondent			0
@entity198 – hands down – had the best and most difficult job in football journalism at the time			0
imagine being told one day : ‘ you ’re f * * * ing banned forever from this ground			0
f * * * ing forever			0
’ only for two days later to have @entity197 on the blower purring : ‘ get you ’re a * * * down here			0
i did n't mean it			0
come down and we 'll have a drink			0
i 've got a story for you			0
fancy a glass of champagne ? ’ @entity198 ’s provides a glorious account of working with @entity197 for 20 years the @entity219 ( @entity220 ) @entity220 ’s @entity221 – about @entity197 ’s doomed 44 - day tenure following the @entity223 at @entity224 - is hauntingly dark and brilliantly researched			0
but where @entity198 ’s account stands as a journalistic triumph , @entity225 is a glorious work of fiction that you so hope to be true			0
it made for quite a film , which you imagine provided you do n’t kiss me would as well			0
@entity234 mentions , too , for @entity235 : a @entity236 , a @entity237 , and a dream ( @entity240 ’s account following a @entity243 high school ’s @entity241 , which inspired the @entity246 - winning @entity245 tv series ) , @entity248 ’s @entity247 ( a classic – for anyone daft enough to not appreciate rugby league ) and , finally , @entity252 : @entity253 ( @entity254 is ‘ as mad as a box of frogs , ’ according to @entity255 )			0
@entity258 @entity259 : the @entity260 and @entity261 ( @entity262 ) the perfect mix of @entity82 life and its captivating football culture from the mid- 80s , nobody is better placed to tell the inside story of @entity269 ’s various scandals – and how they were reported – than @entity262			0
he was in the @entity271 for over two decades , at the heart of @entity274 ’s rise at @entity275 and the serious match - fixing problems			0
while @entity82 has changed immeasurably as a country since @entity262 moved over there , the way in which he tells a footballing story paralleled with the state of the country at the time is fascinating			0
read in three days on holiday			0
so too was @entity284 ( by @entity285 ) , although i ’m not sure @entity287 was particularly ready for that			0
@entity259 ( left ) and all played out ( right ) are two other recommendations from our writers @entity291 all played out : the @entity293 ( @entity294 ) this all - encompassing account of @entity54 at the @entity296 in @entity82 remains gripping even though we all know how the story turns out			0
@entity294 skilfully weaves together a narrative embracing the players , management , fans and opposition and makes it detailed but not at any point dull and simultaneously heart - warming and heart - breaking			0
the author was blessed with an incredible tale to work with of course - @entity311 's tears , penalty pain - but the way in which @entity294 pulls it all together makes this a must - read			1
he also enjoyed access to his subjects in a way that will never now be repeated and they were all , to a man , open and honest with him			0
@entity320 @entity321 : the making of the @entity237 in the @entity322 ) a club that reinvented football , and laid down the foundations of @entity328 's international dominance between 2008 - 2012 , this book provides a brilliant insight into the structure of @entity321			1
@entity331 beautifully delves into the club 's past from the successful @entity334 's ' @entity321 ' of the late 1980 's and early 1990 's and how that all conquering side moulded and defined the club 's future from its academy to the first team which saw @entity133 lead @entity340 to 14 trophies in four mesmeric seasons			1
sir @entity344 's autobiography provides an insight to his 26 years as @entity347 manager @entity348 ( @entity344 ) @entity350 's most decorated manager led @entity347 to a period of dominance that @entity354 football had never seen before , yet he kept his guard well and truly up when it came to providing any insights into his secrets of success			1
sir @entity344 's autobiography finally lifts the lid on his 26 years in charge of the @entity362 hotseat			1
from his feuds with @entity0 , @entity365 and @entity366 to his formulae of winning 38 trophies - this book has it all			1
@entity370 a season with @entity371 ( @entity373 ) an @entity354 writer spends a season travelling around with a newly promoted @entity82 team , for their season in @entity269 from life on board the team plane to shockingly racist @entity382 , this is a stark and revealing insight into @entity82 football			0
inverting the @entity384 : the @entity385 ( @entity152 ) while autobiographies give you a snapshot of the game at any one moment , a book like this is on a different scale			1
a tactical odyssey , explaining where it all started , and how we got where we are today , from the days when teams lined up with seven forwards to the current trend of playing one up front			0
the best history of football you ’ll read			0
a season with @entity371 ( left ) and @entity406 : @entity407 ( right ) complete our writer 's recommendations @entity411 @entity406 : @entity407 ( @entity406 and @entity412 ) a misunderstood and controversial figure , this book highlights the true @entity406			1
it reveals how especially during his young years as a footballer of his tormented and dark days and how he struggled to cope with life after the tragic death of close friend @entity419			0
despite all his on and off field problems no one can deny @entity423 ’s passion for the game and this book underlines just this			1
blessed - @entity427 ( @entity88 ) unlike other autobiographies you read this one really gets to grip with @entity88 challenging his demons and his future from there on			1
it is refreshingly open and honest , and particularly poignant , as best talks about his alcohol problems from the off , his string of female friends , and undisputed success with @entity347			0
from a young boy in @entity443 to a global super star , this book is one which ca n’t be missed .			1
