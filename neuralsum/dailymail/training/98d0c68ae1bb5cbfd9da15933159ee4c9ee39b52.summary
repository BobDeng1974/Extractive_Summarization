the makers of kitchen appliance @entity1 have finally responded to the global backlash they have received over the launch of a new model without warning their customers - including those in @entity9 - saying they were not allowed to pre-promote it as part of ' distribution arrangements '			1
customers who recently purchased the old model @entity14 for $ 1,939 say they feel tricked and would have waited to purchase the new generation @entity16 , which came out in @entity9 on saturday and is only $ 50 more expensive , had they been informed			1
the older model is now $ 250 cheaper in @entity9			1
in a statement to @entity19 , the manufacturer said they were ' deeply sorry ' the september 6 launch had ' resulted in some of our very valuable customers feeling disappointed '			0
' we value every one of our customers and recognise that this is not an ideal situation for everyone involved , ' the statement said			0
' we understand the position of our customers that recently purchased a @entity14 and are taking this issue very seriously			1
' the @entity46 is and always will be an excellent appliance and will continue to be supported just as we have with the previous model the @entity49 which is still supported today , ten years after its launch into the market			2
' @entity52 also added they were working on addressing the concerns of customers who had recently purchased a @entity46 model and were committed to providing the best level of service to their ' very passionate customer base '			1
the @entity63 pages of @entity1 in @entity9 , @entity64 , @entity65 ( @entity66 ) , @entity67 , @entity68 ( @entity69 ) and @entity70 are among those that have been hit with complaints			1
consumer group choice spokesman @entity73 said the organisation had been flooded with complaints			0
' i think $ 1900 is a lot of dough to pay for an old mixer and clearly consumers can feel let down by @entity1 , ' mr @entity73 told @entity19			1
' we do n't think they 've broken any laws but clearly they have broken trust with a very loyal customer base and i think they 're going to pay a price			0
' the @entity66 - designed ' twelve appliances in one ' device has an almost cult - like following			2
they can not be bought in stores , and shoppers hold ' @entity1 parties ' similar to @entity97 parties where a @entity1 consultant comes out to a customer 's home and demonstrates how it works to a group of their friends			1
there are more than 3000 @entity1 consultants across @entity9			1
in @entity9 angry shoppers have set up a ' @entity1 unhappy customers ' facebook page which has almost 1,700 likes			1
@entity110 , 58 , from @entity111 in @entity112 , feels misled by @entity1 others have complained to the @entity114 and state fair trading departments , and a change.org petition started by @entity117 from @entity118 has received more than 1,350 signatures			2
in her petition statement ms @entity117 claims customers and consultants were kept in the dark			0
' many like myself , asked the question before purchasing , if there was a new @entity1 on the way , ' she wrote			2
' my consultant told me that she had n't heard anything about it			0
' she continued : ' @entity133 have misled customers by saying they did n't know about the new model and could n't disclose this information to customers but as of saturday when the new model was launched , they had updated their website and were holding training sessions around @entity9 for their sales teams , using the new @entity16			1
to say they did n't know is an out and out lie			0
' @entity110 , 58 , from @entity111 in @entity112 , bought a @entity1 for herself on august 4 and another for a friend on august 14			2
' that really riles me because i 've bought her a gift that 's already an old model , ' ms @entity110 told @entity19			2
' it 's really frustrating , i had the consultant come out and i was very specific about asking her about new models			0
' ms @entity110 said customers like her are so angry because $ 2000 was a lot of money to spend			0
' that 's why they 're copping so much flak , it 's not that machine 's not worth that kind of money , it 's purely that they were n't transparent with what was coming into the market , ' she said			0
' it was a deception of @entity9 customers			1
' ms @entity110 said she spent years wanting a @entity1 before she finally bought one			0
' if you 're making risotto you chuck the onion , the butter and the garlic in and it chops the onion , saut√©s it with the garlic and then your add your rice and stock and set it to cook and it does it all , ' she said			0
' you come back after 10 minutes and it 's done			0
' the old model @entity46 is now retailing for $ 250 cheaper @entity181 , 40 , from @entity182 in @entity183 , is an admin on the ' @entity1 unhappy customers ' facebook page and said some customers who ordered their device after august 20 had been offered a refund or upgrade to the new model			1
but ms @entity181 , who ordered hers on august 18 , has been told she does not qualify			0
an email from @entity193 told her : ' your @entity1 consultant did not know about the new product at the time of your demonstration and has been presenting the @entity1 of proven quality and value			2
' decisions about the release of new models are not made by @entity1 but are made by our overseas manufacturer and are confidential until @entity1 in @entity9 are officially notified to release such information to customers and the public			1
' it continued : ' the @entity210 is an amazing kitchen appliance that will live up to all that you were shown at the demonstration which lead you to your purchase			1
' i understand with all the talk and hype of a new model this can make you feel let down , but please think back to the reasons you purchased the @entity222 , as the @entity46 has certainly not been superseded by the new model and will live up to all that it is designed to do as per your presentation			2
' an ad spruiking the new model claims it has 10 per cent more capacity , a new locking system ' for better handling ' , a touch screen , a new measuring cup and says it is quieter and more powerful than the old model			0
