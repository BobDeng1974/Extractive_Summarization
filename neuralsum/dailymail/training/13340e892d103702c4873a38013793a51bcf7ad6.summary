the full horror of the crash of the @entity3 rocket emerged last night as witnesses described seeing the stricken pilot who died hurtling to earth in his ejector seat			1
the accident over the @entity9 in @entity10 – which was still unexplained last night – killed @entity12 pilot @entity11 and injured his co-pilot , fellow @entity12 @entity13 , 43 , who managed to parachute from an altitude of nearly 50,000ft and amazingly survived			1
but sir @entity15 yesterday angrily dismissed critics who said the accident was predictable due to his commercial rocket ship ’s ‘ crude ’ design , insisting that it would be ‘ irresponsible ’ to comment before a full investigation			1
and , astonishingly , he revealed that someone had signed up for a flight after the tragedy			1
‘ we have had numerous messages of support from the people – the astronauts – who have signed up for this , ’ he said			0
‘ we even had someone sign up yesterday in support of the programme			0
‘ anybody who ever wants a refund will be able to get a refund			0
’ the billionaire vowed to persevere with his ambition to take tourists into space , insisting he would lead the way			2
he told @entity48 : ‘ i want to be on the first flight – i will be on the first flight			1
’ two men working in the desert witnessed the explosion on friday			0
one , @entity54 , 61 , described seeing @entity11 hit the ground ‘ still strapped into his ejector seat and bounce back up about 150ft in the air before coming to rest ’			1
he said it was ‘ the most awful thing i ’ve ever seen ’ , adding : ‘ it ’s not something you ’d want anyone thinking of flying into space to see			0
’ his colleague , @entity66 , 33 , added : ‘ the pilot ’s body hit the ground first , coming down fast without a parachute			2
perhaps the chute got burned up in the explosion , or did n’t open			0
’ @entity73 has long been accused of ignoring warnings that its £ 312million rocket was unsafe			1
pilot @entity11 ( left ) was killed in the crash near @entity9 , @entity10 , while co-pilot @entity13 ( right ) survived grisly scene : law enforcement officials examine the wreckage of the @entity3 mangled : the undercarriage of the aircraft can be seen amid the twisted metal of the fuselage in the @entity9 sir @entity15 angrily dismissed critics who said the rocket ship 's accident was predictable , vowing that he and his son would be on the first commercial space flight @entity91 , an expert on rocket propulsion , told a newspaper last night : ‘ this explosion is not a surprise			1
it is exactly what i was expecting			0
it was @entity100 roulette which test flight blew up			0
’ warnings were issued as long ago as 2007 after a previous explosion that killed three workers			1
@entity105 , a @entity12 - based @entity106 rocket scientist , warned @entity12 officials last year of another disaster if test flights were given the go - ahead			1
at the time , @entity3 had planned to begin its first passenger flights in december 2013			2
sir @entity15 ’s space tourism project has been plagued with problems and delays from the outset			1
he launched @entity3 ten years ago , promising to take his first passengers into space three years later			1
but he encountered problems in upgrading his first spacecraft and there were claims that his ‘ engineers were working in the unknown ’			0
the first @entity3 disaster hit the project in july 2007 when an early version of the nitrous oxide liquid fuel tank exploded , killing three workers			1
it has also emerged that one of @entity3 ’s star pilots , who left the company for a competitor , had characterised the solid rocket fuel used until recently as being unstable during tests			1
and , in his recent biography of the entrepreneur , the writer @entity134 has questioned sir @entity15 ’s abilities to compete in the space tourism race			1
he said that @entity15 ‘ did not appreciate the consequence of his innocence as he embarked on his final attempt to become a major player in @entity12 ’			2
last night , colleagues described @entity11 , who was married , as highly respected and experienced			2
he had worked for @entity145 , @entity3 ’s partner company in the programme , for 13 years and was a project engineer as well as a test pilot			1
@entity13 is a design engineer for the firm			2
@entity11 ’s widow @entity151 last night said : ‘ i have lost the love of my life			2
i am living in hell right now			0
’ @entity13 ’s father , dr @entity155 , said last night : ‘ it ’s a miracle that my son is still alive			1
i talked to him recently about the new fuel mixture they were testing , and he was confident that it was going to be a great advantage			0
’ despite sir @entity15 ’s determination to carry on with his project , the tragedy has cast doubt on the future of space tourism , with some suggesting his dream might be over			1
but the billionaire entrepreneur said : ‘ once we find out what went wrong , once the test pilots have done all the test flights needed , and once we get the licence , myself and my son will certainly accompany the first commercial flight			1
’ his son @entity177 was with him during the visit to @entity179 , where @entity180 ’s @entity3 took off on friday morning			1
before they met crash investigators , @entity177 was asked if he still felt comfortable joining the inaugural flight , if it ever gets off the ground			0
‘ i ’ll leave it to my father to do the talking , ’ he said			0
while praising his pioneering spirit , critics have accused @entity15 of overstretching himself with his latest venture , which he describes as his ‘ boldest yet ’			1
yesterday his unofficial biographer , @entity134 , said that the crash was ‘ predictable ’ because @entity3 was using a ‘ crude rocket ’ , with an experimental fuel			1
mr @entity134 said : ‘ all the engineers in @entity10 working on the project i ’ve spoken to said it was very dangerous			1
just a few weeks ago the last of many of the @entity3 engineers walked out of the factory and said he ’d never work there again			1
’ but sir @entity15 hit back , saying : ‘ i find it slightly irresponsible that people who know nothing are saying things before the @entity207 make their comments			1
we are determined to find out what went wrong ... this is the biggest test programme ever carried out in commercial aviation history , precisely to ensure that this never happens to the public			0
‘ in testing the boundaries of human capabilities and technologies we are standing on the shoulders of giants			0
’ it could be months before the cause of the disaster is known			0
yesterday debris littered the scrubland chaparral dotted with dunes and @entity226 near @entity227 were evacuated from homes near to where the spaceship ’s fuel tank fell , amid fears of further explosions and toxic poisoning			0
after the blast , mr @entity66 said he saw the spaceship ‘ coming down , spiralling and trailing gas , as if it was leaking fuel			0
it did n’t look as though it was on fire			0
there was no explosion when it hit the ground			0
it just shattered apart ’			0
his colleague added : ‘ the pilot ’s ejector seat left a huge crater beside the road			1
we raced over to see if there was anything we could do			0
but the pilot was beyond help			0
’ the shattered tail section of @entity3 lay in pieces nearby , the word ‘ virgin ’ visible on the torn metal			2
initial suspicions for the tragedy focused on a new mix of fuel being tested for the first time in flight			2
the accident occurred as @entity3 fired up its rockets			2
@entity268 : @entity269 and @entity270 are among celebrities with tickets it remains to be seen how many of the celebrities who paid £ 156,000 to blast into space with @entity15 will take up his offer of a refund			2
more than 700 wealthy passengers – among them @entity270 , @entity269 and @entity278 – have booked seats on the first flights , which had been expected to begin next year			0
while some are said to remain committed , many are expected to pull out quietly			0
however , ticket - holder @entity283 , 68 , a retired @entity106 businessman and former @entity286 canoeist , said the crash had not deterred him			2
he said : ‘ i am confident this will go ahead			0
of course it came to me as a shock , it stopped me in my tracks – i could have been one of those people who was killed			0
but i am utterly confident the people in the @entity9 will rectify the problem and i will fly and i am totally confident it will be totally safe before i do so			2
’ other stars set to fly are @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 , princess @entity301 and @entity302			0
so is it just a waste of time ? the first space tourists will experience just five minutes of weightlessness on their flight , at the boundary of the @entity309 ’s atmosphere and outer space			2
one critic likened it to a ‘ high - altitude bungee jump ’ , while astronaut @entity314 , who flew two shuttle missions , questioned whether the trip was worth the ticket price , saying : ‘ it ’s not much of a space flight			1
