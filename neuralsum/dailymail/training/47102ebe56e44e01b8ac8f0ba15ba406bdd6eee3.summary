by @entity0 published : 06:37 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 06:50 est , 16 august 2013 when former chef @entity2 lost almost half his body weight by swapping his diet of fast food for a healthy one , he was delighted			1
but now his joy has been cut short because he ca n't get rid of the excess skin his weight loss has left behind			1
@entity10 , 55 , was hoping that the @entity11 would pay for surgery to remove the skin but he has been told there is no money available for the operation			1
@entity17 is half the man he used to be after shedding 11 stone , but has now been left with one stone of spare skin @entity10 spent years as a chef preparing meals at restaurants in @entity24 but his problems did n't start until he became a disc jockey more than 20 years ago and would eat burgers for dinner ' i was delighted when i lost the weight but then i have been left in tears and depressed because of what the dieting has left behind , ' said @entity34 , who went down from 21st to 11st 10lbs in 18 months			1
' it 's alright when i am wearing clothes but it looks terrible when i strip off at the gym or to go swimming			0
' @entity10 , from @entity24 , @entity40 , spent years as a chef preparing meals at restaurants in @entity24 but his problems did n't start until he became a disc jockey more than 20 years ago			1
' it was a case of finishing work in the early hours and then going for a kebab or a burger , ' he said			0
' after a while the pounds just started piling on and it left me a physical wreck			2
' the fat laden fast food meant @entity10 , who is not married , suffered diabetes , high blood pressure and thyroid problems			1
@entity10 , 55 , was hoping that the @entity11 would pay for surgery to remove the skin but he has been told there is no money available for the operation ' my health was so bad that i could hardly climb the stairs at home and i was wheezing and out of breath , ' he said , adding : ' my weight was n't caused by medical problems but by my lifestyle			1
' at one stage while he was under the care of a hospital dietician he was told he could have a gastric band if he lost two stone			0
' i lost the weight and they would n't give me the band because i had managed to lose the weight by dieting			1
' now @entity10 has kept to his strict diet but is angry that the @entity11 ca n't help him further			1
' the skin left behind after dieting looks ugly and it makes me depressed thinking that i can not have surgery to remove it			1
sometimes i end up in tears			0
' he said he was so large that he found he hard to walk up stairs so completely changed his lifestyle the dj can not understand how other people can get cosmetic surgery , including women who have their breasts enlarged or reduced using public funds			0

' the @entity133 said that @entity10 's treatment was ' not routinely funded ' by the @entity11			2
requests for treatment have to be supported by clinical evidence and referred to a panel and they make the funding decision			0
