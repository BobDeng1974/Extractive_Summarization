they were supposed to be presenting a united front before tomorrow 's budget marks the unofficial end of the coalition			1
but @entity5 and @entity6 looked more like the cast of @entity8 as they marched through a dark tunnel in bright orange overalls			1
both men rushed to claim credit for a sharp rise in the minimum wage , but behind the smiles there are deep divisions over which tax cuts will be announced by @entity20 tomorrow			1
but the government hopes to set out a more upbeat picture this week , claiming to have brought the @entity41 economy back from the brink			1
tomorrow 's budget is expected to include a promise of tax cuts for low and middle earners , extra money for mental health and freedom for pensioners to turn their retirement into a cash lump sum			1
today mr @entity5 and mr @entity6 made a joint announcement on rises in the minimum wage			1
wearing bright orange overalls on a visit to @entity28 , they looked like they were in the cast of the 1998 film starring @entity31 and @entity32			1
mr @entity5 hopes to use the budget to catapult the @entity61 into a poll lead ahead of the election on may 7 the rate for apprentices will rise sharply by 57p from £ 2.73 per hour to £ 3.30 - 50p more than had been recommended by the independent @entity66			1
ministers said the proposed small hike in the rate for apprentices failed to reflect efforts to boost the status of vocational alternatives as a way into well - paid jobs - and went beyond the recommendation for the second time in three years			1
mr @entity5 and mr @entity6 met apprentices working on a major transport project to promote the change - in one of their last joint appearances as coalition partners before may 's general election			2
' no - one should earn less than £ 3 an hour , ' mr @entity5 said after touring work beneath @entity82 on a station for the capital 's new @entity28 link			1
' it is a good deal , it is right for our country and we can only do it because we have got a strong economy			2
' i have been talking to apprentices here who after two or three years as an apprentice could be earning £ 25 - £ 26,000 a year			2
that 's what i want for our country - a country where if you work hard and do the right thing you get rewarded			2
' mr @entity5 and mr @entity6 both defended a sharp rise in the minimum wage for apprentices to over £ 3 an hour mr @entity6 said the ' vast majority ' of employers already paid apprentices at least that sum but that it was right to significantly increase the minimum			2
' generally governments do what the @entity66 says , ' he said			0
' but on this occasion we felt that ... £ 2.80 - that is still pretty low , even for apprentices to get by on			0
' even though it was right that they earned less than full - time workers ' they do nonetheless need to be paid in a way that allows them to earn and learn , get their qualifications and then move on to full - time employment '			0
with just two weeks until the start of the election campaign , both men will hope to avoid heading to the exit door @entity128 director - general @entity127 said the overruling on the apprentice rate was ' disappointing '			0
' the national minimum wage has been one of the most successful policies of recent years , thanks to the independence of the commission - its politicisation is worrying , ' he said			0
concerns were also raised by @entity140 chairman @entity139 who said the large rise came on top of other increased apprenticeship costs and would have to be ' monitored closely ' , and by @entity145 director general @entity146 who warned that any significant departure ' risks upsetting the fine balance struck by the @entity66 and potentially negatively impacting workers , the economy or both '			0
but @entity155 , director of student recruitment at the @entity156 ( @entity156 ) , said the rise would ' help remove some of the stigma around apprenticeships being a second rate career option , making them more attractive to young people ' though more funding was needed to support small businesses in offering them			0
@entity165 general secretary @entity164 said there should have been a ' much bolder increase ' in the main rate			0
' with one in five workers getting less than a living wage , this is nowhere near enough to end in - work poverty			0
@entity41 's minimum - wage workers should be very fearful of the billions of pounds of cuts to government help for the low - paid that the chancellor is planning if re-elected , ' she said .			0
