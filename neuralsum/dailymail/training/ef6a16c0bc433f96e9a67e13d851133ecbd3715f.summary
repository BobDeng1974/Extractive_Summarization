passed over : lady @entity0 , pictured , was unable to prevent her father 's earldom passing on to a relative he never met the daughters of one of @entity7 ’s oldest aristocratic families missed out on their father ’s title after it was claimed by a distant relative			1
the three children of @entity13 , the 14th @entity14 , tried to block attempts at inheritance by his eighth cousin once removed , @entity18			1
the late earl , who sat as a @entity21 peer in the @entity22 , died in 2010 , but details of the struggle over his title had remained secret until now			1
representatives of his daughters , lady @entity0 , 30 , @entity28 , 26 , and @entity29 , 23 , tried to persuade the @entity30 to pass the title on down the female line instead , according to @entity33			1
the inheritance is one of the most extreme examples of the @entity7 ’s inheritance law for titles , which always favours male relatives over females			2
in this case , the present earl was able to inherit despite having to trace his inheritance back 349 years , eight years before the earldom was created			0
the laws have recently been changed for the royal family , but no reforms have been made for other nobility , many of whom are pushing for change			0
the struggle over to whom the title should pass was based on the interpretation of a @entity58 document from 1666 which created the earldom			2
a possible meaning of the document was that the title could pass to whomever inherited the late earl ’s property – in this case @entity66			2
but the @entity30 was unable to resolve the dispute before the 15th earl had his application for a coat of arms approved by the @entity72 , who controls membership of the @entity75 nobility			1
his title was confirmed on august 15 2010			1
the 15th earl , @entity18 , is a 72 - year - old scholar who is an expert on the works of @entity81 and @entity82			1
he never met the earl whose title he inherited			2
he was unmarried when he inherited , but now lives with his wife , opera singer @entity85			0
@entity86 , pictured , is now the 15th @entity14 , and was the eighth cousin , once removed , of the 14th @entity14 the unusual path of inheritance is the latest twist in an often painful history for the family			1
@entity13 ’s eldest son , who would have inherited had he lived , killed himself in 2001			2
@entity94 , known as lord @entity95 , shot himself with his father ’s at his family home in @entity98 while on leave from a psychiatric hospital			0
the 14th earl died of cancer aged 55 in 2010 , and did not live to see his daughter , a paramedic , marry @entity104 , an @entity105			1
the couple had a son , @entity107 , before divorcing			0
all three daughters now live in @entity105			2
however , members of the family have said that the title is not a great loss because of its association with family tragedies			0
@entity115 , the aunt of @entity66 and her sisters , said : ‘ i think we took the collective view that there were so many sadnesses attached to it and it had no benefits			0
‘ there is no money or estate with the title — it is just an adornment			0
there is n't a stately home and there is n't much money			0
’ the 14th @entity14 , pictured speaking in the @entity22 , died in 2010 and never met the man who inherited his title @entity135 in @entity75 , pictured , was the family 's ancestral seat until it was sold in the 1990s however , the inheritance did bring with it something of value			1
the @entity142 pearls , a family heirloom , passed between the @entity144 of @entity145 , and , now that the current earl is married , will pass to his wife from the late earl ’s widow			0
