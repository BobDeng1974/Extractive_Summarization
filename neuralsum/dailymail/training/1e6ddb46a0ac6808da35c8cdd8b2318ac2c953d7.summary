by @entity0 published : 11:58 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 11:58 est , 9 april 2013 a teenage girl was today recovering in hospital from a deadly snake bite after a desperate jungle journey by wheelbarrow , canoe and a rusty lorry			1
relatives pushed @entity9 through muddy jungle tracks on a wheelbarrow , paddled her across rivers by canoe , and loaded her onto an old lorry to get her to a hospital 35 miles away in time to save her life			1
the incredible journey through some of the world 's most inhospitable terrain took seven hours - more than enough time for @entity9 to have died from the bite of the deadly @entity23 snake , yet somehow she pulled through			1
deadly : @entity9 , 15 , from @entity24 endured a desperate seven - hour journey through the jungle to hospital after she was bitten by a taipan snake like the one pictured			1
( @entity31 image ) last night , as she sat by @entity9 's bedside in the @entity35 @entity34 , in the nation 's capital , the 15 - year - old 's mother , @entity40 , told of the journey that had saved her daughter 's life			1
@entity9 had run down the steps of their home in @entity49 village , in the @entity50 , to follow her mother , but as she set out on the grassy path the venomous snake sank its fangs into her left foot			1
the girl ran screaming into her grandfather 's house , about 100 yards away , where she explained she had just been bitten by a snake			2
' ten minutes later she was vomiting and started to cough up blood , ' said her mother			2
it was then , without any usable roads in the area , friends and relatives banded together to use whatever means were possible to get @entity9 to hospital			1
they were unaware that the snake that had bitten @entity9 was one of the world 's deadliest and victims could die within 30 minutes			1
' we put her in a wheelbarrow and pushed her along until we reached the @entity76 , ' said mrs @entity40			0
' then we put her in a dinghy and carried her down the river , making several crossings , to a point where we were able to get a ride on a truck			0
' the @entity83 is a genus of large , fast - moving and highly venomous @entity86 snakes			2
species of this genus possess highly neurotoxic venom with some other toxic constituents which have multiple effects on victims			2
the venom is known to paralyse victim 's nervous system and clot the blood which then blocks blood vessels and uses up clotting factors			2
members of this genus are considered to be among the most venomous land snakes based on their murine @entity102 , an indicator of the toxicity on mice			2
apart from venom toxicity , quantities of venom delivered should also be taken into account for the danger posed			0
a coastal taipan , the kind which bit 15 - year - old @entity9 , is capable of injecting a large quantity of venom due to its large size			1
temperament also varies from species to species			0
the inland taipan is generally shy while the coastal taipan can be quite aggressive when cornered and will actively defend itself			0
but , she told @entity121 newspaper , the truck could not go far because all roads in the area had been washed away by recent floods			0
with @entity9 now in a coma , mrs @entity40 and relatives found another wheelbarrow and pushed @entity9 for a mile to a first aid post , where they were told the teenager needed anti-venom - fast			1
the group were eventually able to reach another health centre by phone where staff arranged for an ambulance to find its way through damaged roads			0
precious minutes ticked away as the group of friends and relatives waited anxiously for the ambulance			1
when it arrived another bumpy journey began for the young snakebite victim			0
it was not until 2am that @entity9 finally arrived at the @entity35 @entity34			1
' thanks to the quick actions of her mother , father @entity151 and other family members , @entity9 was quickly pumped with @entity23 anti-venom and is alive to tell the story , ' the newspaper reported			1
the taipan is the major cause of snakebite death along the south coast of @entity24			0
it can strike with extraordinary speed and accuracy , and often sink its fangs into flesh multiple times			0
its venom causes excessive bleeding and paralysis , acute kidney failure and seizing up of the muscles of the heart			0
in the worst cases death can occur within half an hour			0
a medical paper advises that people who have been bitten should be kept as immobile as possible and be transported to hospital immediately			0
' bringing this young girl part way on a wheelbarrow was unconventional but it almost certainly saved her life , ' said a spokesman for the hospital .			0

a @entity23 , one of the world 's deadliest snakes , bit @entity9 , 15
victims of the taipan often die within 30 minutes , but she lasted seven hours
that was enough time for friends and relatives to get her to hospital
