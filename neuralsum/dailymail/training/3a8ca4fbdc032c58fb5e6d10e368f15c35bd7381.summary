i 'm not invincible : @entity1 says giving up drinking has been tough but she has learnt a harsh lesson for a woman famous for commentating on the pampered existence of footballers ' wives , @entity5 's own life is a cautionary tale for any aspiring @entity11			1
we meet at lunchtime in a @entity15 cafe , yet she is dressed up as if ready for a night out , in drainpipe jeans , thigh - high leather boots and a black leather biker jacket			2
tumbling mahogany hair frames her heavily made - up face , which is prettier , softer and less severely botoxed in real life than photographs frequently suggest			2
i 've often bumped into @entity1 at celebrity parties where she 's a fixture , dolled up and teetering on vertiginous heels , a glass of champagne permanently clamped in her expensively manicured hand			1
she is warm and quick to laugh			2
yet i often thinks she looks sad – and never more so than during our lunchtime meeting			2
at 46 , @entity1 's alarmingly slender frame seems out of proportion with her surgically enhanced breasts , and she quickly admits : ' i have suffered periods of depression , to be honest			1
' her weight is low , she says , because ' when i 'm unhappy i find it hard to eat '			0
last month , @entity1 revealed the shocking news that she is suffering from the pre-cancerous condition @entity40 , which she believes has been brought on by her ' out - of - control drinking '			1
' i was never like my old friend @entity42 , but the truth is drink had become a problem for me , ' she admits			0
' i think it can happen for a lot of women who watch their calorie intake			0
i forget to eat and not even notice if i 'd just had a banana or the odd canape			0
but a glass of fizz would give me a lift and keep me going while rushing around			0
' while she may once have ' had it all ' – her ostentatious white wedding in 1994 to former @entity59 and @entity60 footballer @entity58 was , of course , covered in depth in @entity63 ! magazine – @entity1 concedes that she turned to alcohol as a means of coping with the couple 's bitter divorce , which was finalised in december 2012			1
she was brought up in leafy @entity69 upon @entity70			2
her late father was art director at the @entity73 advertising agency , and her mother ran the @entity76 shop in @entity77 , @entity78			0
convent school - educated @entity1 abandoned her plans for university and began modelling after being discovered by legendary photographer @entity83 when she was 18			1
she met @entity58 the following year , and the couple went on to have two sons – @entity86 , now 19 , and @entity87 , 12			1
she nursed @entity58 through two bouts of testicular cancer , but he left her for opera singer @entity90 in 2010			1
when their marriage ended , it was @entity1 who had to pay her unfaithful ex-husband a substantial settlement because he claimed to be ' broke '			1
with two children to raise , the pressure on @entity1 was intense			1
and drink became a solace			0
the couple divorced in 2012 ' i was n't staggering around drunk or behaving giddily , ' she admits			0
' but i was gradually drinking more and more			2
nobody on the showbiz circuit wants to see a sad , moaning person – they want a happy @entity1 who is good for a laugh , and i have always tried to be			1
' @entity1 realised all was not well with her health when she began to experience severe heartburn last year			1
' at the time , i was working on @entity11 ! the musical , doing tv and radio shows [ @entity116 on @entity117 , and online radio station @entity119 ] and writing my magazine columns as well as doing the school run , ' she recalls			0
' so when i developed a few symptoms – recurrent heartburn and a lump in my throat that made it hard to swallow – i did something i would never recommend and i put off seeing my doctor			0
' when she finally did visit her gp , it was after a night of ' agony ' that kept her from sleeping			0
' i was having stabbing stomach pains and crawling around the floor of my house in the middle of the night , ' she says			0
' i thought i was having a heart attack , so i called the gp			0
' the doctor carried out a gastroscopy , which involved feeding a camera on a wire down her throat and into the stomach			0
he discovered that @entity1 had stomach ulcers			1
she was advised to cut down on drinking and was prescribed antibiotics			2
however , the pain and lump in her throat continued to be a problem , and last @entity154 returned to the clinic for a second round of tests			0
they revealed she was suffering from chronic acid reflux and pre-cancerous changes			1
out on the town : with @entity162 at a showbiz party last year ' it 's frightening			0
my doctor warned me , ' carry on drinking , and you will die			2
' ' @entity40 can develop in one in ten patients who suffer recurrent bouts of heartburn , where digestive acids rise up from the stomach into the oesophagus ( the tube that runs from the stomach to the throat ) , causing a burning sensation			1
a valve at the bottom of the oesophagus opens to allow food to pass through into the stomach when we swallow			0
in some people this valve is faulty and can lead to acid reflux or heartburn			0
@entity188 's @entity40 is usually treated simply with lifestyle changes , such as eliminating caffeine , alcohol and spicy foods , and eating smaller meals , but some patients will need to take medications that stop acid production			1
if a biopsy shows that there are continuing changes in the cells lining the gullet , a procedure called radiofrequency ablation is offered – a probe called an electrode is used to kill the abnormal cells with an electrical current			0
about one in 200 people with @entity40 go on to develop cancer of the oesophagus , @entity212 's fifth - biggest cause of cancer deaths – 7,000 people die of the disease every year			1
@entity1 has none of the usual risk factors for the condition – it is most common in men , the over- 50s , smokers and those who are overweight			1
but she believes her case was triggered by her ' champagne lifestyle ' , and the diagnosis has been a wake - up call			1
' it would be fair to say that there are a number of factors that can make acid reflux worse , including being overweight , certain foods , smoking and excessive alcohol , ' says professor @entity234 , a consultant gastroenterologist at @entity235 in @entity236			2
' if ignored , long - term and persistent acid and bile exposure of the oesophagus can cause @entity40			1
' since her diagnosis , @entity1 avoids large meals , and has cut out spicy meals and acidic foods such as citrus fruits			1
she also takes the antacid medication @entity245 , and has to return to her gastroenterologist for check - ups every three months			2
dealing with her drinking has been a harder challenge			2
despite being advised to cut out alcohol by her doctors , over the months , as her symptoms alleviated , @entity1 told herself she could have ' the odd one ' but her heartburn returned with a vengeance			1
' maybe it 's more to do with the fact i was not eating enough , so the acid from the drink was going straight into my throat and stomach lining without any food to soak it up , ' she says			0
' little did i know the damage i was doing to my insides			0
' while @entity1 still attends a-list events – earlier this month she mingled with heart - throb actor @entity267 at the @entity268 after - party at the @entity271 – her glass will now contain sparkling elderflower juice			1
' i have to abstain from alcohol completely because of the damage the booze has done to my throat			2
if i carry on , i risk losing my voice , then i will have no radio show , no career , and no income			0
i 'm a single mother with two sons who depend on me , ' she says			0
' i do n't mind admitting giving up drink is hard			0
but i know i can do it			0
all this has taught me something : i 'm tough , but i 'm not invincible			0
' monday urinetown the musical gala event @entity289 : 4 glasses of champagne @entity292 : 360 units : 4 tuesday @entity295 reception and dinner @entity289 : 2 glasses of champagne 1 glass of white wine @entity292 : 330 units : 3.5 wednesday business meeting at @entity303 , @entity304 ; party at @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity15 drinks : 1 glass of white wine ( large ) , 3 glasses of champagne @entity292 : 420 units : 4.5 thursday beauty product event at @entity313 ; @entity315 party in @entity316 @entity289 : 3 glasses of champagne @entity292 : 270 units : 3 friday the @entity320 , @entity78 @entity289 : 4 glasses of champagne @entity292 : 360 units : 4 saturday at home @entity289 : 2 glasses of white wine ( large ) @entity292 : 300 units : 3.5 sunday at home @entity289 : 3 glasses of white wine @entity292 : 450 units : 3.5 total cals : 2,490 @entity332 : 26 @entity1 's right to admit addiction , says @entity335 , health editor does unwinding with a couple of glasses of wine every night really mean you have a problem ? if you admit to doing so , and do n't stop within a couple of weeks , your gp might soon be suggesting you take anti-addiction drug nalmefene – once reserved for serious drinkers to help them get over the physical shock of going cold turkey			1
it may save the @entity349 billions in the long run by averting treatment for alcohol - induced illnesses such as obesity ( look at how many extra calories @entity1 consumed in a week ) , diabetes and liver disease			1
yes , we may know someone who lived to be 104 while drinking a gin and tonic every lunchtime , but they 're the lucky ones			2
whether or not @entity1 's cancer scare was the result of drinking , it was a wake - up call to the fact that she was papering over emotional problems in her life with drink			1
the first step in tackling addiction is admitting you are out of control			2
but the key to overcoming it is recognising the reason you got there in the first place .			0

@entity1 is suffering from pre-cancerous condition @entity40
she believes it has been brought on by her ' out - of - control ' drinking
says she turned to alcohol as a means of coping with divorce from footballer @entity58
