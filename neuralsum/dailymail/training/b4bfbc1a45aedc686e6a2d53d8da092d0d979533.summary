the mobile @entity29 camera was introduced last year and first used in @entity78 ’s @entity59			2
photos are taken roughly every 2½ seconds while the walker is in motion			0
' it ’s very top heavy			0
… that was probably the toughest part – taking care of it and trying not to damage it , ' @entity46 told the @entity49 ' i told [ @entity7 ] it would probably not come back in the condition it goes out in			1

the huts have been preserved by the intense cold - and offer an insight into the grim conditions faced by @entity142 and @entity140 a century ago			0
the panoramas were created by a lightweight tripod camera with a fisheye lens - as @entity7 had not yet developed its backpack			1
