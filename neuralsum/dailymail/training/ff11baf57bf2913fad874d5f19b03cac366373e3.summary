by @entity0 published : 06:14 est , 26 january 2014 updated : 06:14 est , 26 january 2014 @entity3 governor @entity2 will warn @entity4 that a proposed currency union with the @entity6 if his nation votes for independence may not be viable the head of the @entity3 will this week warn @entity4 about the dangers of a separate @entity11 keeping the pound			1
bank governor @entity2 is expected to compare the ‘ currency union ’ between the rest of the @entity6 and an independent @entity11 proposed by the @entity15 to the crisis - hit @entity16 when he meets the first minister for the first time later this week			1
if he secures a yes vote in september ’s referendum , mr @entity4 claims @entity11 could keep the pound , with the @entity3 continuing to represent @entity11 and make key decisions on issues like interest rates			2
but it has emerged that the @entity26 bank chief has major concerns about whether formal currency - sharing unions can ever work between countries			0
and he has confirmed that he intends to raise these concerns when he meets the @entity15 leader and delivers a major speech in @entity33 on wednesday			1
in a interview recorded last week , mr @entity2 warned of ‘ issues ’ with currency unions which have already been seen in @entity37			2
in a clear reference to the troubles of crisis - hit countries like @entity41 and @entity42 , he also warned of the ‘ challenges of having a currency union without certain institutional structures ’			1
it is a significant intervention from mr @entity2 , who has not previously discussed the issue of @entity11 independence in detail			2
when asked if an independent @entity11 could keep the pound , he said : ‘ well , there are issues with respect to currency unions			1
we ’ve seen them in @entity37			0
‘ it ’s one of the factors that affects the outlook for the @entity6 economy , has affected us over the last five years , affects us going forward - the challenges of having a currency union without certain institutional structures			1
@entity11 first minister mr @entity4 has previously claimed that his country could keep the pound , with the @entity3 continuing to represent @entity11 and make key decisions on issues like interest rates			2
‘ i ’m actually going to speak to this issue in @entity11 next week and i ’m certainly going to meet with the first minister prior to doing so			0
’ the comments come after senior members of the @entity68 warned that it was ‘ unlikely ’ that the rest of the @entity6 would agree to a pound - sharing union after independence			0
although he is unlikely to completely rule out the possibility of a pound - sharing union in @entity11 , mr @entity2 is expected to raise his concerns about how it would work in a private meeting with mr @entity4 on wednesday , before he delivers a speech to the @entity79 in @entity33			1
however , when asked if he would look forward to managing a shared currency with an independent @entity11 , he insisted the he and his colleagues ‘ would implement whatever remit we were given ’			1
a @entity6 @entity68 source said : ‘ it is significant that mr @entity2 has outlined the comparison that others have been making			0
' we have been saying for some time that a formal currency union on the @entity6 pound is highly unlikely			2
more and more individual voices are now saying why that is so			0
’ mr @entity2 is expected to warn that the new union could be plagued by the same problems that have threatened the crisis - hit @entity93 in a further blow to the @entity15 , a former chief manager at the @entity3 has also warned that a deal on a currency union ‘ is not in @entity4 ’s power ’ – and that @entity98 voters could demand that a deal is blocked			1
@entity103 , who has also worked in senior roles at the @entity105 and the @entity106 , said that a currency union would mean that the rest of the @entity6 would have to give up some of its decision - making power on economic issues – which he said it was ‘ conspicuously unwilling to do with its @entity114 partners ’			1
in an article published today , he said it is ‘ almost certainly in @entity11 ’s interests ’ to reach an agreement with the rest of the @entity6 to share the pound , but went on : ‘ it is not in @entity4 ’s power to do so single - handedly			1
' it requires the agreement and consent of the continuing @entity6 government , and it is nothing like as clear that - viewed from @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 - a common monetary area with an independent @entity11 is desirable			1
’ he warned that the rest of the @entity6 may not be willing to give up some of its economic power to a separate @entity11 and may not be willing to accept the risk of having to ‘ bear the lion ’s share of any financial bail - outs ’			0
and he also warned of a backlash from @entity98 voters after a yes vote , who may demand that there is ‘ no hanging on to the best bits of the @entity139 ’			0
a poll on @entity11 independence will be held on september 18 this year , and if successful @entity11 independence day is planned for march 2016 mr @entity103 said : ‘ at the moment , it suits the nationalists not to allow voice from elsewhere in the @entity6 too much of a platform			0
' but if @entity11 votes yes , they will have to allow the rest of the @entity6 to speak , because you can not negotiate with someone to whom you do not allow a voice			0
‘ and if the nationalists will have to talk to the rest of the @entity6 after a yes vote , it might be advisable to know what they are thinking and listen to what they are saying before it			0
’ the @entity159 campaign is also today publishing the views of 50 experts who have raised doubts about a currency union			2
campaign leader @entity164 said : ‘ the choice we face is clear - believe @entity4 or believe the experts and the facts			0
’ a @entity170 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity170 has put forward sensible proposals for a formal monetary union that would ensure both governments had full flexibility over their fiscal policies , within an overall sustainable framework			0

@entity2 will speak to @entity4 before a speech in @entity33
he is expected to raise concerns over a proposed currency union between @entity125 and an independent @entity11
in an interview @entity2 compared the union to the crisis - hit @entity93
