the head of the @entity1 has warned that @entity3 jets could crash into airliner planes resulting in a massive loss of life because the fighter jet has not been fitted with a collision avoidance system			1
air chief marshal sir @entity9 told defence secretary @entity10 about the dangers of the £ 126m @entity3 , which is not fitted with an airborne collision warning system , an official report has revealed			1
the annual report revealed the @entity16 's military aviation watchdog has said a collision avoidance system must be fitted to the @entity1 's fleet of @entity19 ' with full haste '			1
a @entity3 - the head of the @entity1 has warned that such jets could crash into airliner planes resulting in a massive loss of life because the fighter has not been fitted with a collision avoidance system the annual report from the @entity28 also warned that a collision between a @entity3 and a commercial jet , however improbable , would be ' catastrophic '			1
the @entity28 's advice follows a critical report issued last year into a mid-air collision between two @entity34			2
the @entity35 said programmes had started for the fitting of systems			2
the @entity28 said that the failure to fit a collision avoidance system to @entity3 jets aircraft was ' unsustainable ' and must be pursued ' with full haste '			1
in his annual report into air safety , the director general of the @entity28 , air marshal @entity43 , said anti-collision software should also be fitted to the new @entity48 fighter			2
air chief marshal sir @entity9 ( pictured ) has warned of the dangers of the @entity3 , which is not fitted with an collision warning system @entity51 said there were ' well documented failings over the fitment of an airborne collision avoidance system ( @entity56 ) to @entity57 '			1
he added : ' in the worst case , which is judged improbable but catastrophic , a @entity3 colliding with commercial air traffic could result in severe consequences for the @entity35 because of the likely substantial third party loss of life			1
' such a crash , he warned , could result in more than 50 deaths , and ' would have adverse repercussions for the institution responsible , in this case the government of the day '			1
the report says the majority of mid-air collisions involving @entity16 military aircraft have taken place below 3,000ft , and with @entity1 aircraft now spending more time at a medium level than they did previously , there is an increasing likelihood of a fast - jet conflict with commercial air traffic			1
the report goes on to state that in the annual @entity16 @entity85 report in 2013 , it detailed 14 incidents ranging from four @entity87 ( safety not assured ) to one @entity87 risk of collision			2
@entity51 said : ' the provision of an @entity56 to @entity3 is an important issue for @entity93			2
' ultimately , the @entity3 will be in service for many years , and if the @entity35 elects not to fit an @entity56 , the decision will need to be well documented and the risk held at the highest levels of defence			1
' an @entity35 spokesman said : ' the department has welcomed the @entity28 's report , and is acting upon its comments and recommendations			1
' air safety is at the core of all our aviation activity and we take very seriously our obligations to our people and the wider community to ensure that our activities are both as safe as reasonably practicable and comply with relevant policy and legislation			0
' the @entity35 said a collision avoidance system was being fitted to the @entity57 , the type of aircraft involved in the crash over the @entity118 in 2012			1
three crewmen died in the incident off the @entity122 coast in aircraft flown out of @entity124 in @entity118			0
@entity125 from @entity126 based at @entity124 pictured flying over the @entity127 work was also underway to have a system developed for @entity19 , the @entity35 said			1
it added that ' further technologies ' and ' planned upgrades ' were proposed for the new @entity48 fighter			0
in october it was revealed that plans to fit @entity118 - based @entity136 jets with a potentially life - saving crash warning system had been hit by fresh delays			1
defence chiefs had promised that the anti-collision system would be installed in the aircraft by the end of last year , having been first identified in 1990 but plans have repeatedly been shelved			0
the pledge was reiterated in july , after a scathing report into the 2012 crash involving two @entity147 over the @entity118 found the failure to fit the technology contributed to the deaths of three crew			1
but trials of the new equipment found a ' number of issues ' that will lead to ' revised timescales '			2
@entity157 , the @entity118 mp and @entity160 defence spokesman , discovered the latest delay after tabling questions in @entity163			0
the questions have also revealed that the @entity35 has already spent £ 49.7million developing the system			1
in response to a query about the equipment , defence minister @entity165 said in october : ' flight trials of the @entity170 and @entity171 in two @entity136 aircraft during 2014 have revealed a number of issues that require resolution before the system can be rolled - out across the fleet			2
' it is not possible to give an indication of revised timescales until the scope of the additional work has been properly assessed			0
' the @entity35 said a collision avoidance system is being fitted to the @entity57 , the aircraft involved in a crash over the @entity118 in 2012 when three crewmen died - pictured is some of the recovered plane wreckage tornado jets are currently involved in @entity16 military action against the @entity189 terror group in @entity190			1
mr @entity157 said last year : ' this further delay is the latest broken promise in a long running and scandalous situation			0
' it is utterly unacceptable that the timetable for installing a collision warning system has slipped further			2
' the publication this summer of the @entity28 report into the tragic fatal collision over the @entity118 highlighted a chain of bad decisions based on cost - benefit - analysis which is completely wrong when we are talking about service personnel 's lives			2
' now that the @entity35 has extended the life of the @entity136 's after their botched @entity209 it is even more imperative that these systems which were recommended over 15 years ago are finally installed			1
' an @entity35 source told added : ‘ avoidance of collision in the air can not be purely reliant on equipment of any sort as it is not effective against all types of aircraft			1
' this is why a multi-layered approach is more effective incorporating de-confliction planning , extensive flying supervision , sound airmanship , equipment fitted to aircraft to aid situational awareness , employment of suitable radar services and ultimately an effective lookout from the aircrew to “ see and avoid ” each other			2
’ the maa 's inquiry into the 2012 crash found 17 factors contributed to the deaths of flight lieutenant @entity236 , squadron leader @entity237 and flight lieutenant @entity238			0
it recently emerged an @entity240 fighter and a light aircraft came dangerously close to colliding over @entity242 because of an air traffic control blunder			0
the jet was taking part in a training exercise when the pilot spotted a @entity248 in its path at around 2,600ft			0
it dived and shot underneath the smaller plane within around 200ft of it			0
a report said the pilot of the single - engine @entity255 did not see the @entity3 before it passed beneath him			1
the @entity16 @entity257 , which examines near - misses , classified the degree of risk of a collision as @entity87 , or high			0
they said safety margins were reduced ' to the minimum ' in the scare over @entity265 , @entity266 on the morning of july 31			0
the board blamed an air traffic controller at @entity269 for allowing the @entity3 to fly ' into conflict ' with the @entity255			0
@entity1 @entity3 aircraft on exercise in @entity273 - it is not fitted with a collision avoidance system they said the pilot of the private plane had correctly informed the base of his plans to fly			1
he telephoned the control tower at @entity281 before taking off from a nearby airstrip and was told @entity283 would be operating from the base but was not given any specifics			0
the @entity269 air traffic controller said he was controlling three different types of aircraft at the time the near - miss occurred			0
he did not see the @entity255 on his radar until he received a warning that another plane was in front of the @entity3			0
he said when he radioed to warn its pilot , he was told the jet had just passed beneath the @entity255			0
@entity297 said : ' the @entity3 pilot was in a reasonably busy phase of flight , descending and configuring his aircraft for an approach , so his lookout would have been compromised			0
' the report concluded : ' the @entity85 felt that the @entity255 pilot had done his best to inform @entity281 of his intentions to fly close to their radar pattern , had called them on the radio , and had attempted to route away from their normal radar pattern			0
' the @entity85 discussed at length the cause of the @entity257 and eventually agreed that @entity313 had allowed the @entity3 pilot to fly into conflict with the @entity255			0
' it added : ' the incident had just stopped short of an actual collision where safety margins had been reduced to the minimum			0

head of @entity1 has warned that @entity3 jets could crash into airliner planes
any such incident would result in a massive and ' catastrophic ' loss of life
report said collision avoidance system must be fitted ' with full haste '
watchdog found *absence* of key piece of equipment is ' unsustainable '
@entity35 says work is underway to have a system developed for @entity19
