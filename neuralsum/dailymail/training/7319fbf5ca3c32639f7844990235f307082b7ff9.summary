' the footage made public wednesday by the anti-abortion group @entity8 was secretly taped on two separate occasions by two pregnant women who came to the @entity12 clinic of dr @entity13 in december and march pretending to seek third - trimester abortions			1
@entity13 , one of only four physicians in the country currently performing late - term abortions , is heard on the recording laying out the gristly details of the procedure , explaining to his would - be patients that he will inject a shot into the fetus that will make it get ' soft ' and ' mushy			1
' scroll down for undercover video busted : dr @entity13 ( pictured ) was recorded telling undercover anti-abortion activities posing as would - be patients that their fetuses would turn ' mushy ' like ' meat in a @entity29 ' pro-life crusade : the videos were made as part of a national campaign targeting abortion providers like @entity13 at one point , the doctor , seated at a desk in his office , compares the unborn baby to ' meat in a @entity29 , ' and he later jokes that he has a toolkit containing a ' pickaxe ' and a ' drill bit ' to remove the remnants of the dead fetus from the womb			1
a first portion of the video was recorded on the morning of december 7 , 2012			0

the unnamed woman , who is described as being 22 weeks pregnant at the time of the sting operation , is ushered into the doctor ’s office and is seated opposite him			0
in response to the patient 's inquiry regarding the procedure , @entity13 explains that the fetus in her womb would be injected with a shot through her stomach , which is supposed to kill it and induce birth			2
' if everything works right , they come out - you just deliver them and they come out fine , ' he says			0
@entity78 details : @entity13 explained to his ' patient ' that he would inject the fetus in her womb with a shot that would kill and induce delivery three days later ' if , for some reason , that does n't happen , then we have to take them out in pieces			2
' when prompted by the undercover pro-life activist , the physician explains that the medicine injected into the unborn baby kills it and the fetus turns ' soft - like , mushy , ' allowing the mother to ' push it through			2
' the bogus patient inquires what exactly makes the fetus soft , to which @entity13 responds : ' the fact that it 's not alive for 2 or 3 days			0
' he then adds , ' it 's like putting meat in a crock pot , okay ? it gets softer it does n’t get infected ... ' @entity13 has been in the news in recent months following the tragic death of his patient @entity106			2
small club : @entity13 is one of only four doctors currently providing late - term abortions in the @entity110 locations : dr @entity13 operates two clinics in @entity12 and @entity114 the 29 - year - old teacher from @entity116 , traveled to @entity13 's clinic in @entity118 , @entity114 , in february to terminate her pregnancy at 33 weeks after it became apparent that her fetus had developed abnormalities			1
following a complex multi-day procedure , the 29 - year - old married woman allegedly suffered a ruptured uterus and passed away from massive internal bleeding in a nearby hospital			1
although the circumstances of the woman 's death remain unclear , the pro-life community has rallied around the tragic case , accusing dr @entity13 of being directly responsible for @entity106 's death			1
dr @entity13 , 69 , one of only four physicians in the country who openly perform late - term abortions , has been in the cross-hairs of pro-life groups since 2005 , when another patient of his died after having her pregnancy terminated			1
@entity13 had been practicing in @entity12 until 2010 , when the state banned abortions performed after the 20th week			1
after that , the doctor began traveling to the clinic in @entity118 to provide his services			0
pro-life activists have been picketing the clinic for the past three years , carrying signs and even trying to talk @entity13 's patients out of doing the procedures on their way into the office			2
tragic end : @entity106 , pictured with her husband , @entity153 , passed away after getting a late - term abortion in @entity13 's @entity114 clinic under fire : pro-life activists have been picketing the clinic for the past three years , carrying signs and even trying to talk @entity13 's patients out of doing the procedures in march 2013 , just weeks after @entity106 ’s death , the pro-life @entity160 sent in another undercover activist who was 26 - weeks pregnant to inquire about performing an elective late - term abortion , emphasizing that there is nothing wrong with the baby			1
the physician once again explains on tape how the baby would get ' mushy ' like ' meat in a @entity29 ' after being injected with a shot			0
first public comment : dr @entity13 told an activist pretending to be a patient that @entity177 died from complications unrelated to her abortion he then goes on to describe how if the woman is unable to deliver the fetus on her own , the medical staff will take out the baby from her womb with a ' toolkit , ' adding jokingly that his arsenal includes ' a pickaxe , a drill bit			2
' when the woman expresses concern that she might go into labor in her hotel room , @entity13 tells her that she could call him rather than 911 , and his staff would come , take away the dead fetus and help ' clean up the mess			0
' towards the end of the consultation , @entity13 briefly addressed @entity106 's case , marking the first time that he has publicly commented on the woman 's passing			0
the 69 - year - old doctor tells the woman seated in his office that the 29 - year - old deceased patient had a ' allergic reaction ' to her pregnancy that was unrelated to the abortion procedure , adding that her fetus had severe abnormalities			1
