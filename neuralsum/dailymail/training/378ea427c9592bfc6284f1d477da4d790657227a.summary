author ] published : 09:18 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 11:05 est , 6 june 2013 pull a @entity2 - owned suitcase off an airport conveyor belt and chances are you will be able to tell where in the country its owners are from , just by opening it up and taking a peek inside and you need n't even look too closely at the contents of the bag to make your guess ... just at how they have been packed			1
whether you 're a roller , a wrapper , a shrinker , a flinger or a stacker may provide clues as to where in the @entity2 you reside , according to new research into the holiday packing habits of the population			1
are you a flinger , a roller , a wrapper or a stacker ? where in @entity2 you live might determine it holiday - makers from @entity34 , the @entity35 and @entity36 are most often space - saving ' rollers ' , turning each item of clothing into a neat little sausage to maximise space and prevent crumpling			1
the @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 is home to the super-neat and ultra-careful ' wrappers ' , fond of neatly encasing each piece of clothing in tissue paper to minimise ironing later			2
architecturally - savvy ' stackers ' are most often found in @entity52 and the @entity53 , and they can be spotted building piles of clothes , beginning with the largest pieces and working their way up to the smaller items in an orderly manner			1
one third of @entity2 will be stowing away food and beverage favourites such as teabags , brown sauce , pork pies , digestive biscuits and marmalade into their suitcase to enjoy while on holiday			2
' @entity72 ' fashionistas - most frequently found in @entity73 and @entity74 - are the most forward - thinking of the lot , choosing outfits for every day of the holiday , then vacuum - packing each one to utilise on space and aid un-packing later			2
and then there are the ' flingers ' , those who do n't have the time , energy or inclination to bother with any of the above , and instead just hurl anything they can find into the open suitcase and pray it will close			0
and these busy souls are living in @entity94 and the @entity95			0
@entity100 , those who do n't have the time , energy or inclination to bother rolling or stacking , instead just hurl anything they can find into the open suitcase and pray it will close the research , conducted by @entity102 , also found that 52 per cent of the @entity2 who will be going on summer holiday this year ( 75 per cent ) will dedicate an enormous seven hours packing their holiday essentials , which includes shopping for bits and pieces needed for the trip			2
rollers fold and roll clothes into arrange in an orderly manner within their suitcase ( @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 ) wrappers neatly wrap each piece of clothing in tissue paper to prevent creasing ( @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 ) stackers build a stack of clothes starting with the biggest items at the bottom and working up to the smaller items ( @entity52 , @entity53 ) @entity123 make complete outfits and vacuum pack to utilise space and aid un-packing ( @entity73 , @entity74 ) @entity100 throw everything into a bag with no order or folding involved ( @entity95 , @entity94 ) despite this , @entity2 holidaymakers will collectively splash out £ 684 million during their holiday on essential items they have accidentally left at home , an average spend of £ 26.50			1
some 51 per cent of us forget something important at home , and the items most frequently needed to be bought at the airport or holiday destination are men 's swimming trunks , followed by jumpers and cardigans , then bikinis , dresses , sunglasses , shorts , underwear , coats and finally shoes			1
in all , the @entity2 will splash out a staggering £ 684 million ( an average spend of £ 26.50 ) on forgotten items every year			1
@entity102 surveyed 2,000 adults aged 25 to 34 , and found that 82 per cent of holidaymakers find packing for their summer break very stressful			0
a fifth ( 20 per cent ) of @entity2 totally rely upon their partner to pack for them , and one in ten farm the task out to their mothers			1
the research also revealed a fifth ( 21 per cent ) of lazy @entity2 just throw a selection of items into their suitcase and play pot luck with their belongings on holiday , while 61 per cent pack with military precision and dedicate time to prepare a detailed schedule and essentials check - list prior to starting the task			1
ironically , whilst @entity2 holidaymakers ' bulging suitcases may be lacking one holiday essential , more than two thirds of us ( 67 per cent ) of @entity2 usually bring back home up to six unworn complete outfits and three pairs of shoes that were not suitable for their holiday			1
how do you pack yours ? to help @entity2 pack better for their holiday , @entity102 developed a seven step guide to ensure no essential holiday items are left behind for this year ’s summer break			1
step one : think @entity193 & where consider everything you might be doing during your holiday ( @entity198 dinners , sporting activities , sight seeing ) then put your favourite items for these scenarios on your bed in piles of tops , bottoms , dresses , shoes , jackets / cover - ups , swimwear			1
anything that does n't have a specific use does n't need to come with you			0
step two : colour code clothes : look at everything and choose items based on the fact they will work with lots of other items			0
thinking of a colour palette makes this even simpler			0
what you are doing here is ensuring everything works really hard and you do n’t end up lugging loads of things that just do n’t go with anything else and you will end up never wearing			0
step three : divide & rule once you have decided on your clotting , lay it out on the bed before you place them in the suitcase and cut in half			0
it may sound drastic but it forces you to focus and just remember all the items you have taken on holiday before and never worn			0
@entity244 : @entity245 ’ , @entity245 ’ , @entity245 ’ roll every item that can be rolled , as this will negate creasing			0
if you take anything remotely tailored , turn it inside out and tuck in the sleeves and it will arrive in the best shape possible			0
sitting on your suitcase to cram everything in is a common last resort step five : @entity258 the shoes pack shoes at the bottom of your suitcase and surround them with your underwear			2
remember to pack into the corners of your bag - lots of space can be wasted by not filling a bag correctly			2
step six : go see through see through wash bags with compartments are brilliant for organising your toiletries			0
they tend to be lightweight and you can check quickly to see if you 've forgotten anything step seven : weather planning look at an updated weather forecast just before packing to ensure you are taking the right clothes for the weather conditions at your destination .			0

@entity2 will spend an average of £ 26.50 *buying* items we forgot to pack
despite this , two - thirds of us always *overpack*
67 *%* of us bring home six unworn outfits and three unworn pairs of shoes
