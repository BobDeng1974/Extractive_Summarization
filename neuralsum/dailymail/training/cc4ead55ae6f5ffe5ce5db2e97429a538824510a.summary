one of the @entity1 ' largest department stores had been forced to remove a dangerously violent @entity2 from it 's shelves after an international backlash			1
@entity5 attracted worldwide attention when a shopper in one of it 's stores posted a snap of the garment online two days ago			1
@entity13 uploaded a picture of the t - shirt onto her @entity17 page with the caption : ' really ? in the boy 's section ? ' it 's not rape , it 's a snuggle with a struggle ? ' an outraged shopper at @entity1 supermarket chain @entity5 spotted this violent t - shirt and posted a picture onto their @entity17 page earlier this week			1
the photo soon went viral and within 48 hours the stores had removed every top ' @entity5 - the same mall that has the daily angelus and refused to show @entity35 's " @entity34 " in the cinemas ? ' boys listen to @entity38 -- if a girl says no and pushes you away , just err on the side of caution , she likely means no. and go watch " @entity34			1
" she continued : ' i count myself among those worked really hard especially in the 90 's for the rights of girls and women so it really got me upset			2
' i was shaking when i took it			2
i wanted to throw up			2
' since the photo was posted on september 22 , it has now received 1,578 likes , 4,383 shares and 440 comments			0
one user wrote : ' i just got out of bed to go to the bathroom but this one now woke me up			0
i do n't even know what exactly to say -- this is just so wrong			0
' another said : ' @entity5 has all the resources in the world			1
they need to hire better people so this never happens again and they really need to make up for this now			0
' a big company has an even bigger social responsibility to control what goes through their stores			0
' the bad publicity led to @entity5 removing all of the t - shirts from their stores			1
the picture of the t - shirt has prompted thousands of angry reactions on social networking sites including @entity76 and @entity17 the have also released a statement on their @entity17 page			1
it said : ' we have been informed via social media that we have a t - shirt in stock with a message that we too find unacceptable			0
' we do not tolerate such action			0
' @entity5 does not support such irresponsible and malicious acts that mock important and sensitive social issues			1
' we have immediately pulled out all the t - shirts of the consignor that distributes them , and we are investigating why it was included in our delivery of assorted t - shirts			2
' the woman who initially posted the picture is now appealing to people on social networks to come forward if they know the company that initially designed the clothes			2
after an international backlash , @entity5 quickly removed the t - shirts from their stores and issued a public apology a spokeswoman for @entity105 & @entity106 said : ' while we 've come across products like this in the past , @entity105 & @entity106 finds it shocking and deeply disappointing that garments like these continue to be designed , manufactured and retailed			1
' rape is a violent , terrifying crime that has a wide range of long - term and often lifelong impacts on those it affects			0
' so - called jokes like this are not only offensive and distressing to the huge numbers of sexual violence survivors who come across them but , when printed on t - shirts marketed to young boys , are also potentially damaging			0
' while some might argue that this kind of slogan is just harmless fun or ' banter ' , through our frontline specialist work supporting those affected by sexual violence , we know they contribute to wider social attitudes that trivialise sexual violence and violence against women and girls and make it difficult for survivors of these horrific crimes to seek the support and justice they want and deserve			0
