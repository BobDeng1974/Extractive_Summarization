by @entity0 last updated at 10:54 am on 28th november 2011 despite the strength in numbers of regional voting , @entity1 lost her place in @entity7 semi-final last night			1
after battling @entity9 in the bottom two , it seems her native @entity11 could n't save her			1
it comes as little surprise , considering the 17 - year - old forgot the lyrics to her first song on saturday while performing @entity17 in the guilty pleasures round			2
but as @entity9 belted out a hit from the @entity34 soundtrack , nailing her version of @entity36 by @entity37 , it was clear who was going to be saved			2
judge @entity39 said : ' it 's getting tougher and tougher			2
i 'm taking everything into consideration , judging on last night 's two performances and the sing - off			2
the act i 'm sending home is @entity1			2
' home time : @entity1 's rendition of @entity30 's @entity50 was not enough to save her against @entity9 fellow panellist @entity51 followed his lead , saying : ' i 'm going to base my decision on the person who has a career after the show , who will sell records and sell out arenas			1
' i 'm sorry to say i 'm sending home @entity1			2
' their mentor @entity63 turned on the waterworks , refusing to decide between the two			0
@entity66 : @entity1 gives rival @entity9 a hug as she 's voted off the show she said : ' i know how great these two young ladies are			1
@entity1 , i admire you as a musician and you bring something so unique to the music industry			0
i absolutely love you and adore you			0
' @entity9 , my goodness girl , you just want this so bad			0
i have to pass it , i 'm sorry			0
' this meant that the majority verdict overruled , without @entity79 even having his say , as @entity81 declared @entity1 was going home			0
supporting @entity83 : @entity84 did n't hold back when @entity81 asked her who she wants to win home turf : @entity87 also found fame on the show , and now hosts the @entity90 however , when @entity81 later quizzed @entity79 , he said : ' i 'd have sent @entity1 home			1
' @entity1 simply said : ' i 'm feeling very confused			0
i ca n't wait to leave the show and get my music out there			1
' the show opened with guest appearances from @entity87 and @entity84 , before the live show finalists sang charity single @entity98 - which saw the return of @entity101 and @entity102			1
@entity103 and @entity104 joined the contestants onstage , after they were called in at the last minute by @entity106 in a bid to boost sales on the track in honour of @entity111			0
success stories : @entity103 and @entity104 returned to sing on the charity single , with both bands having found fame on the show potential @entity117 ? @entity106 brought in @entity103 and one direction to sing on the song as he was worried about sales @entity81 announced : ' good news			1
the chancellor has decided to waive @entity123 on the single , so all money will go to charity			0
' @entity83 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity9 will now compete in the semi-final next week			0
meanwhile , 14.1milion tuned in to see @entity130 voted off last night , compared to 2.5million less for rival @entity131			1
over the past few weeks , @entity131 tends to win the biggest audience during the saturday show , but the @entity7 results draw more			1
welcome back ! @entity135 , @entity101 and @entity102 returned to sing the charity single support : @entity138 was seen arriving at the @entity7 studios , no doubt invited by @entity79			0
