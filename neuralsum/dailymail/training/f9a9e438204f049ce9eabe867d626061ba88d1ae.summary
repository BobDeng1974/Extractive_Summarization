by @entity0 published : 14:47 est , 5 december 2013 @entity2 : 16:28 est , 5 december 2013 @entity3 has come to the defense of his former colleague @entity5 , saying that @entity6 went too far in firing the anchor over his call to have someone defecate in @entity11 's mouth			1
' i 'm sorry to learn that @ @entity14 is out at @entity6 ... @entity5 created great television , ' the actor wrote on his @entity18 account on thursday			1
' you can disapprove of @entity5 's single remark and still acknowledge his talent			2
' @entity3 has a vested interest in the firing as he was in a similar position less than two weeks earlier after he and his short - lived cable show were ousted from the network following his homophobic insults to reporters			1
helping him out : @entity3 ( right ) tweeted that he thought @entity5 ( left ) should not have had to resign over one inappropriate comment hedging his bets : @entity3 came out against the comments but said that @entity5 ' created great television ' though @entity5 made his inappropriate comments about the former @entity35 governor around the same time as @entity3 was recorded using the homophobic slur , @entity3 was fired much more quickly			1
the actor then cited the fact that @entity5 had yet to be reprimanded as an example of the network 's hypocrisy			2
he clearly has changed his tune in light of the wednesday afternoon announcement that @entity5 was facing a similar fate after having his resignation accepted by @entity6 bosses			2
@entity3 , 55 , posted a string of @entity18 messages to his widely - followed account saying that while what @entity5 said was wrong , it was also wrong for him to be forced out over the incident			1
' broadcasters on certain networks are called upon to offer analysis of events and public policy , day in , day out often with tremendous aggression and scalding language , ' @entity3 wrote			2
' if , over the course of hundreds of hours on the air , they commit a foul then it 's like high - sticking in hockey or a late hit in the @entity69			0
but to end someone 's job ? ' ' some of these cable venues really are off - @entity74 ...			0
and their need for a reliable , even forced , homogeneity is more apparent than ever			0
whatever side of the political aisle they line up on			0
' bringing it to an end : @entity11 said that it was right for @entity5 to leave his show and it showed him taking responsibility for his actions @entity3 's show of support came hours after @entity5 released a statement saying he would be leaving @entity6 after hosting his eponymous show on the channel for three years			1
@entity11 also spoke out about the resignation , saying that his decision to take himself off the air was an example of the mainstream media doing the right thing			0
' it was refreshing to see though that many in the media did come out and say look our standards have to be higher than this those with that platform - with the microphone , with a camera in their face - they have to have some more responsibility taken , ' she said on @entity111 on thursday morning			0
his effort : @entity5 previously apologized to the former @entity35 governor both on and off air but then took some time off from work and later returned announcing his resignation @entity5 previously apologized to @entity11 both on and off camera - which she accepted - but said that he decided his resignation was necessary			1
' upon further reflection , and after meeting with the president of @entity6 , i have tendered my resignation , ' he wrote in his statement			0
' i deeply regret what was said , will endeavor to work hard at making constructive contributions in the future and will always have a deep appreciation for our viewers â€“ who are the smartest , most compassionate and discerning of all television audiences			0

@entity5 made lewd on - air comments about @entity11 , calling for someone to defecate in @entity11 's mouth after she compared the *federal* debt to *slavery*
@entity6 did not formally reprimand @entity5 but he resigned on wednesday
came around the same time as fellow @entity6 host @entity3 got *suspended* - and later fired - for using homophobic slurs outside his home
many - *including* @entity11 and @entity3 - called the move *hypocritical* for firing @entity3 but not @entity5
now @entity3 has taken to @entity18 to turn the blame around on the network
