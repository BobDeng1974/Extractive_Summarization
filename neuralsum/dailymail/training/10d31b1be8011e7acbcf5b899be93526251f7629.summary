from monday , the popular @entity10 seafood spice - which has a @entity12 - like following , particularly in the @entity14 area - will be added to the tartar sauce of the fast good giant 's @entity3			1
the idea was developed by @entity4 's franchisee in - where else ? - @entity19			0
store owner @entity20 said he came up with the idea because so many customers added @entity1 to the fried fish burger , and so he pitched the idea to his head office			1
' we know that @entity1 is as popular as salt and pepper on our tables here in @entity19 , ' mr @entity20 told the @entity30 ' @entity31 is extremely excited to be able to deliver a true , local taste to our customers			2
' nearly 700 @entity31 â€™s locations in @entity10 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 will offer @entity3 with @entity1 tartar sauce			1
the limited - time - only offering is an official partnership between @entity4 's and @entity42 , the @entity10 company that makes @entity1			1
the seasoning was named after the @entity45 , a passenger ship line that plied the waters of the @entity48 from @entity19 to @entity49 , @entity35 , in the early 1900s			2
it began as a spicing for bushels of blue crab , with the main ingredients of mustard , paprika , celery salt and bay leaves			0
old favorites : the @entity3 has been a @entity4 's staple since 1962 , while @entity1 has a cult following in the @entity14 , where it is added to almost everything however , for many , it has become a necessity that can be sprinkled on just about anything , from popcorn and potato salad to even beer and doughnuts			1
