by @entity0 published : 06:16 est , 4 january 2014 updated : 09:57 est , 4 january 2014 a third of adults across the world are now classed as obese or overweight			1
a global ‘ explosion ’ means that 1.46 billion adults across the globe are obese or overweight - meaning they have body mass indexes greater than 25			1
in the @entity10 , 64 per cent of adults are classed in this category and are at greater risk of heart attacks , strokes , cancers , diabetes and other health - related issues			1
a third of adults - 1.46 billion - across the world are now classed as overweight or obese in the developing world , the number of obese and overweight adults has quadrupled from 250 million in 1980 to 904 million in 2008			1
by contrast , the number of people who were overweight or obese in high - income countries increased by 1.7 times over the same period			1
the research was conducted by the @entity30 , which also warned of the associated health risks of the trend			2
it suggested that changing diets and over-consumption of food linked to increased prosperity in the developing world was largely behind the change			0
as incomes increase , diets are shifting from cereals and grains to a greater consumption of meats , fats and sugars			2
the odi 's @entity49 report found that the percentage of adults who were overweight or obese globally grew from 23 per cent to 34 per cent between 1980 and 2008			1
at the same time , under - nourishment is still a problem for hundreds of millions of people			2
based on @entity57 statistics , this graph shows the proportion and percentage of adults across the world classified as obese or overweight , categorised by income the overweight are at risk of heart attacks , strokes , cancers , diabetes and other health - related issues ' the over-consumption of food , coupled with lives that are increasingly sedentary , is producing large numbers of people who are overweight and obese - primarily in high - income countries , but also in emerging middle - income countries , ' the report said			1
' indeed , the world has seen an explosion in overweight and obesity in the past 30 years			2
' the odi examined changing overweight and obesity rates across world regions and by individual country using data published in @entity86 last year , the @entity81 said			0
this revealed that @entity88 , the @entity89 and @entity90 saw overweight and obesity rates increase to a level similar to @entity92 , around 58 per cent			1
at 70 per cent , @entity93 still has the highest percentage of overweight adults , but regions such as @entity97 and southern @entity90 are catching up , with 63 per cent			1
report author dr @entity98 said that those with higher incomes had greater ability to choose the foods they want , the @entity81 said , while changes in lifestyle , increased availability of processed foods and influences such as advertising and media have led to dietary changes , particularly in emerging economies			0
with data from @entity115 , 2012 , this graph shows the proportion of adults overweight in 1980 and 2008 this graphic , based on figures from @entity119 , 2012 , shows the changing proportion of obese adults in the developing world ( dark orange ) compared with the high income world ( pale ) in millions the report said : ' the evidence is well - established : obesity , together with excessive consumption of fat and salt , is linked to the rising global incidence of non-communicable diseases including some cancers , diabetes , heart disease and strokes			1
' what has changed is that the majority of people who are overweight or obese today can be found in the developing , rather than the developed , world			2
' the @entity30 said there was ' little will ' among the public and leaders to take action to influence future diets , ' but that may change in the face of serious health implications '			0
and it highlighted the ' paradox of public policy ' , saying : ' in general , there is little appetite amongst politicians or the public in high - income countries to take strong measures to influence future diets			0
' politicians are fearful of meddling with diets , and alienating farming and food - industry interests			0
it seems that this reflects public opinion , with many people seeing food choices as a matter of personal freedom			0
' most people hate to see regulation of the access to favoured foods , see taxation of unhealthy foods and ingredients as onerous and unfair , and acquiesce only in response to public information and education			0
' couple this with lobbying from food industries , and the political will to affect diets withers			0
' the report gave the example of @entity185 as having made concerted efforts to preserve healthy elements of the country 's traditional diet , via public campaigns and education , providing large - scale training for women in preparing healthy , traditional food .			0

those with body mass index of 25 - plus are classed as obese or overweight
obese and overweight adults are at greater risk of heart attacks , strokes , cancers , diabetes and other health - related issues
in the @entity10 , 64 per cent of adults are now classed in this category
