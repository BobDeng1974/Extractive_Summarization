by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 15:27 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 15:27 est , 13 september 2013 your next mobile phone or computer could be powered by a glass of wine , chipmaker @entity2 has revealed			1
at the firm ’s annual developers conference in @entity1 , it showed a low - powered computer able to draw enough power from a glass of red wine to power itself up			1
the project was demonstrated by dr @entity15 , who said : ‘ some people turn water into wine , here at @entity2 we 're turning wine into electricity			1
’ @entity2 pran a computer by drawing enough power from a glass of red wine ( picture from @entity2 conference in @entity1 ) the firm hopes the experiment , designed to show off how little power computers and sensors could run on , could lead new a new breed of computers and wearable sensors that constantly monitor our health , for instance , and are powered by the heat from our skin			1
‘ it 's possible to start to imagine a world of incredibly low power but also with high performance , which will help unburden us , help us do things that are remarkable and gives the ability to power things like constant sensing , communication , and computing - all of which are necessary for our mobile future , ’ she said			2
an @entity2 researcher carried out the groundbreaking demo			2
‘ today , we 're not here to talk about watts			0
we 're not even here to talk about milliwatts			0
we 're here to talk about microwatts , ’ he said			0
‘ we 're talking computing solutions so low that , in the future , we should be able to power them with the heat of our skin or the ambulant light in the room or , like i show you today , maybe something just a little bit more entertaining			2
’ the project was demonstrated by dr @entity15 ( pictured far left ) at the annual @entity2 developers conference in @entity1 the demonstration saw a researcher take a bottle of red wine and pour it into a glass containing two electrodes			1
as the current flowed between them , sensors came to life and showed live data feeds on a giant screen			0
‘ you might remember in grade school , you did a little experiment where you took some lemons and you put a copper penny and a nail in there , and you lit up an led , ’ the researchers said			0
‘ well , we 're in @entity97 , so we 're going to do the same thing , only wine is cheaper than lemons here			0
so we 're going to do it today with wine			0
‘ so i 'm going to take my bottle of wine here , and i 've got a glass , i 've got some copper , and i 've got some zinc in there , so i 'm going to do really that same experiment we did in high school or in grade school			2
’ dr @entity15 ( pictured ) said : ' some people turn water into wine , here at @entity2 we 're turning wine into electricity ' @entity2 says the technology could see computers in new and inaccessible places			1
‘ low power is essential for the future of wearable devices and sensors in smart spaces , where frequent charging or power cables would be burdensome or even impossible , ’ said @entity2 ’s @entity124			1
‘ only then can technology be truly personal and embedded into the places and spaces we inhabit and move through			0
’ earlier this week @entity2 introduced a line of extremely low - power processors called @entity136 for wearable and embedded devices another demonstration focused on cyclists , with a smart fabric jacket that lit up when it sensed a cyclist was braking or going quickly to alert drivers nearby			1
a prototype being developed by @entity145 in @entity146 , it is made using smart fibers that have sensors , in this case accelerometers , built in .			0
