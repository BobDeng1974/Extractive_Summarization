by @entity0 published : 03:08 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 03:09 est , 19 september 2012 a young girl left severely brain - damaged from salmonella poisoning after eating a @entity4 chicken twister is in danger of losing her $ 8million award after lawyers appealed today			2
@entity9 girl @entity8 , who is now 14 , became so ill seven years ago she could not speak and will be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of her life			1
her parents said the money would be a great help for her ongoing care – but lawyers for the fast food giant said it had filed papers contesting the court ’s finding and the award			0
compensation under threat : brain - damaged @entity8 ( centre ) pictured with her parents @entity27 and @entity28 , and siblings @entity30 , 14 , @entity31 , 3 , and @entity32 , one the appeal places miss @entity8 in danger of losing all or part of the money - and could also result in her family having to pay a fortune in legal costs			1
@entity39 in @entity40 said it understood @entity4 was also trying to force @entity41 and her family to pay its legal costs from her 2009 court hearing , which are expected to amount to hundreds of thousands of pounds			1
@entity4 denied it was responsible for @entity41 ’s brain damage but during the court hearing a number of poor hygiene practices were revealed at the store in the suburb of @entity51 where the family purchased their chicken meals			2
in april this year , three years after the initial hearing , justice @entity55 found in favour of the family and ordered @entity4 to pay the £ 5 million compensation			1
tragic : @entity8 ( left ) before her illness and ( right ) after the salmonella poisoning which left her severely brain damaged but lawyers for the company told the @entity65 today that they have formal lodged appeal submissions , based on three factors			0
they said the appeal included claims that there had been a ‘ failure to consider evidence ’ during the initial hearing , an ‘ error in the judge ’s factual findings ’ and an error in the weight given to certain evidence			2
through their own lawyers , the @entity8 family immediately hit back at @entity4 ’s appeal submissions , saying they were ‘ an amorphous restatement ’ of what had been said during the trial			1
it is understood that with the appeal pending the @entity8 family , who live in a modest home in @entity9 , have not received any of the award money			0
where it happened : the @entity4 restaurant in @entity51 near @entity9 when the judge announced the award in april , family lawyer @entity94 said the compensation was ‘ very much needed			1
’ he added : ‘ @entity8 ’s severe brain damage and severe disability has already exhausted the very limited resources of the family			0
’ during the initial hearing the court heard that after dining at @entity105 and her brother both ended up in hospital , but she was left significantly the worse of the two			0
referring to miss @entity8 ’s parents , mr @entity94 said : ‘ @entity8 is now a big girl and they are finding it increasingly difficult to lift her and to look after her basic needs as well as look after @entity8 ’s younger siblings			0

@entity8 can not speak and will be confined to wheelchair for life
@entity4 ordered to pay damages by a judge in april
but restaurant denies *responsibility* and claims previous hearing was *flawed*
*teenager* could lose all or part of her compensation
