by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor axing thousands of soldiers may have put the country at ' significant risk ' , the government 's spending watchdog has revealed in a blistering report published today			1
the @entity8 said the decision to cut the army 's regular forces from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2018 , while ramping up the number of reservists , was taken without testing whether it could work			1
it also revealed the plan was running up to six years behind schedule - leaving the army dangerously short of soldiers			2
the report said the cuts may ' significantly affect the @entity22 's ability to achieve its objectives '			1
@entity24 defended the government 's army cuts at @entity28 's questions today			1
the defence secretary @entity29 ( second right ) said the strength of the army reserve was growing for the first time in nearly 20 years the former head of the @entity22 lord @entity35 said even if the goal of increasing reservist numbers is met by 2018 , there will be at least three years before then when the @entity22 is under strength			1
he warned that this could leave the country at risk			0
he said : ' if it stays relatively quiet and we are not committed anywhere then the risk will not materialise , but if something happens , the strategic shocks happen , and we are terribly bad about spotting them , then we could be embarrassed and we could be in some difficulty			2
' audit office chief @entity50 added : ' @entity22 requires an overall reduction in the size of the @entity22 and a fundamental change to its composition , with a significant reduction in the number of regulars and a substantial increase in the number of trained reserves			1
' military judgment played an important role in decisions but committing to moving towards an @entity22 structure with fewer regular soldiers and an increased number of reserves within the planned timescale should have been subject to more rigorous testing of feasibility			1
' @entity71 and @entity22 must get a better understanding of significant risks to @entity22			1
' ministers said the overhaul of the army was needed to save cash - helping the @entity77 save Â£ 10.6billion over 10 years			2
but the @entity8 said it could actually end up costing taxpayers more			0
audit office chief @entity50 said : ' the planned timescale should have been subject to more rigorous testing of feasibility			0
' he added that the risk of a shortfall in the recruitment of new reserves could ' up the pressure on regular units '			0
@entity89 's @entity88 chair @entity87 said she was ' astounded ' that despite the military cuts the cost of army to the taxpayer may actually go up @entity87 , chairwoman of the commons public accounts committee , added : ' the @entity77 focused heavily on cutting costs rather than on recruiting , training and integrating a substantially increased number of reserves , something the @entity22 is already failing to do			1
' she added : ' even after all this , i am astounded to find that reducing the size of the @entity22 will not alone deliver the financial savings required for the @entity77 budget			1
' unbelievably , it may even mean increased costs to the @entity108 if the reservists are deployed			0
' the army 2020 re-structuring programme forms part of the package of defence cuts originally set out in the @entity115 's @entity114			1
it will see the regular @entity22 reduced to its lowest level since the time of the @entity119			1
shadow defence secretary @entity120 said the restructuring plans were ' in danger of collapse '			0
he said : ' this devastating report points to a litany of errors and serious failings at the @entity77 under @entity24			0
' defence ministers were warned that these plans would not work unless they were properly tested and monitored			0
' they were told that front - loading cuts to the @entity22 and back - ending recruitment to the reserves would leave the @entity133 under strength			1
they did n't listen and now they 're in a complete mess			0
' chief of the general staff general sir @entity138 ( left ) defended the ' @entity22 ' plan to overhaul the service			1
he said the plan ' will endure ' the test of time general sir @entity138 , chief of the general staff , said : ' the @entity8 report fails to capture the nature of the austerity we faced at the time these decisions were made			0
' the @entity22 has designed a novel and imaginative structure which best meets the challenges we are likely to face within the resources made available			2
' thankfully , most of the structural change for our new model , which we call @entity22 2020 , is now behind us			2
' we are recruiting regular and reserve soldiers for this new @entity22 avidly			2
i am confident that , having made such significant changes , the army 2020 model will endure			0
' defence secretary @entity29 said : ' the @entity77 has always been clear that the numbers in the @entity163 would fall before they increased , but we have now seen the trained strength of the @entity163 climb for the first time in nearly 20 years			0
' asked about the issue at @entity28 's questions , @entity24 said the government inherited a reserve that had been ' under - resourced and undervalued for years '			0
' we now have a five - year programme for building them up			0
' that programme is under way , it is gathering pace			0
what we are going to see is the strongest possible professional @entity22 with all of the best equipment they could have , and a very strong reserve force backing up , making sure we can meet all of the obligations we set out in the @entity180			2
