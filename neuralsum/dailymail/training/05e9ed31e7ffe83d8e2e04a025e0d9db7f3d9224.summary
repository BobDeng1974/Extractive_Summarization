@entity0 , who admired @entity4 ’s honesty , said : ‘ i should speak to @entity2 , but it really is very simple and i am sure he understands the situation			1
@entity4 has played a lot of games recently and it is the first year in the @entity46 for @entity3 for a while , so the games have been quite high pressure			2
‘ he looked a bit tired when he came up and i will just tell him that — that he was feeling a bit tired and i made the decision to play ( @entity38 ) @entity38 , but he recovered well enough			0
‘ he is 100 per cent fully fit and really it was just a decision on my part			0
@entity2 has been talking about the pressures @entity4 has been under and the fatigue that may have set in a little bit , so i am pretty sure he will be dealing over the next month with @entity59 as he sees fit			1

@entity2 , who expects to see @entity4 back in training at @entity65 on tuesday and is likely to play him against @entity66 on sunday , criticised @entity7 ’s training methods in september after striker @entity68 ruptured his thigh muscle			1
@entity4 does not believe he should be criticised for airing his thoughts regarding his physical fitness @entity73 's @entity3 team - mate @entity38 was selected to start in his place against @entity8 @entity7 boss @entity0 took the decision to bench @entity4 and bring him on in the second half @entity73 defends @entity7 tiredness the @entity3 boss claimed @entity68 needed two days to recover from a match , but @entity0 insists there is no medical evidence to prove this is beneficial			1
@entity0 said : ‘ @entity4 might say it is something that is becoming ingrained in him and that he felt the need to talk about being tired more than he would normally do			0
‘ i do n’t think there is a lot of medical evidence to support the two - day recovery			0
‘ i would expect players not to take it for granted that there will be two - day recoveries			0
on the other hand , it could easily be like this time when we did virtually nothing in terms of what i consider to be training the day after the ( first ) game and we did 40 minutes including warm up the day before the ( second ) game and that was at a fairly low level intensity			0
