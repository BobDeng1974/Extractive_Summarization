by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:05 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 06:52 est , 1 november 2012 senior @entity2 last night warned @entity3 of the dangers of state regulation of @entity7 ’s free press ahead of the publication of the @entity9 on media standards next month			1
@entity12 mayor @entity11 said that @entity7 ’s international reputation was due , in part , to a vibrant press exposing corruption and incompetence			1
and @entity17 , @entity18 chairman of the culture , media and sport select committee , warned he would not support any statutory restrictions on newspapers and websites			1
strong : @entity11 said that @entity7 ¿ s international reputation was due , in part , to a vibrant press exposing corruption and incompetence he criticised the government for giving @entity30 too broad a remit and expressed concern that the inquiry looks unlikely ever to examine the culture of phone hacking at the @entity36 – which triggered the inquiry in the first place – because of criminal investigations			1
both were speaking to mark the launch of the @entity42 , a campaign which argues that a vibrant free press is essential to any democracy			1
the government is preparing to receive the @entity30 report , amid growing speculation that it may recommend at least a ‘ backstop ’ in law to a new system of media regulation			2
labour leader @entity53 is expected to push ministers to accept whatever @entity30 recommends			2
but there is growing alarm among senior @entity2			2
mr @entity11 said : ‘ one of the reasons @entity12 is regarded as the greatest city on @entity61 to live and invest in is because we have the stability that goes with , not just the rule of law , but a system of government that is almost entirely free from corruption and criminal activity , at virtually every level			2
view : @entity17 , @entity18 chairman of the culture , media and sport select committee , warned he would not support any statutory restrictions on newspapers and websites and that is very largely thanks to the free , dynamic , irreverent and independent media that we have and is one of the glories of this country			1
‘ we have got to fight to keep it that way			0
’ mr @entity17 , whose committee conducted its own inquiries into phone hacking , told an event in @entity88 : ‘ we should hold back from statutory regulation			1
' at the end of the day this matter is so important it should be @entity93 that decides what to do , not a judge – however eminent			0
’ he told the audience he believed statutory regulation would be ‘ incredibly dangerous ’ and urged @entity30 to give a ‘ chance to the much stronger independent regulatory body being established ’ by the industry			2
he said the new regulator would have the ‘ teeth ’ lacking from the @entity104			0
‘ we should give the body a chance and we will step in if it ’s not seen to be doing a good job , but i do n’t want to legislate now because i think that represents a step that ’s incredibly dangerous , ’ he added			0
‘ the suggestion newspapers might be held back from a legitimate investigative role would be a considerable danger			0
’ the mp also claimed that it was clear the terms of reference of the @entity9 were ‘ too wide ’			1
and he expressed concern that the two main issues – how the @entity36 allowed journalists to tap into mobile phone voicemails and why the police failed to act – appeared unlikely to be examined because of criminal inquiries			0
@entity125 , professor of journalism at @entity126 , insisted that a new regulatory press body must be independent from @entity128 , @entity93 and the state			2
he told the event , attended by campaigners for state regulation of the press , including comedian @entity134 , that any form of @entity128 intervention would give succour to dictators in countries such as @entity140 who seek to shackle free speech			1
in the @entity145 yesterday , however , several @entity144 peers urged tighter regulation			0
witness : actress @entity148 was among a host of public figures who gave evidence to the @entity9 lord @entity153 , host of @entity154 , said erring journalists should be barred ‘ from practising their profession in the same way a lawyer or doctor would be struck off if they had acted improperly ’			1
@entity162 of @entity163 , a shadow minister and former aide to @entity165 , said : ‘ @entity144 supports a strong and free press that can hold politicians to account , which is essential in a democracy , but a strong and free press must have responsibilities too			1
‘ most other professions including judges are regulated and there do n’t seem to be many problems there			0
it is unhealthy for any industry to be its own judge and jury			0
’ @entity181 , a government minister , said the status quo was ‘ not an option ’			0
‘ as the prime minister has recently commented : we do n’t want heavy - handed state intervention but the status quo is not an option , ’ he told peers			0
@entity190 , professor of communications at @entity191 , said the proposals for self - regulation put forward by @entity194 and @entity195 sounded ‘ admirable ’ , but that it had to be underpinned by legislation to ensure that publishers could be held to account			0
professor @entity190 said press freedom had to be weighed against the rights of individuals			2
professor @entity190 was part of the advisory committee for the @entity205 ’s submission to the @entity9			1
backing the judge : labour leader @entity53 is expected to push ministers to accept whatever @entity30 recommends			0

mayor said @entity7 *'s* international reputation was due in part to free press
