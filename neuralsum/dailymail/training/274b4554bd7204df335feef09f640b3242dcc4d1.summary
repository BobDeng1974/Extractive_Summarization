his administration would later claim that forcing three lanes of the bridge into a single toll booth was the result of a mismanaged traffic study supervised by @entity29			0
@entity126 , the executive director of the @entity124 / @entity18 @entity23 , angrily ordered the traffic lane closures reversed , but not until public safety risks persisted for nearly a full work week in a lengthy press briefing on thursday , the defiant governor forcefully denied any involvement			1
