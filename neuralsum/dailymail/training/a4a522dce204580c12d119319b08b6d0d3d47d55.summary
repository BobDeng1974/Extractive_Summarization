it has launched the careers of musical greats such as @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 , but the @entity6 has n't always hit the right notes on the sartorial song sheet			0
with a bearded lady , a troupe of @entity11 rappers and a @entity13 boyband among the entrants for this year 's show , @entity6 looks set to be more entertaining than ever - although whether all will get it right on the night remains to be seen			0
just in case @entity20 's @entity19 and her competitors need any reminders of what not to do , @entity18 has rounded up the very worst fashion disasters of the show in all their spangled , @entity28 and @entity29 - filled glory			2
shine bright : @entity31 , a @entity33 @entity6 entrant in 1998 , brought his dusters along in case the stage was in need of a quick polish you killed how many parrots ? @entity41 singer @entity40 celebrates her victory in 1998 - but her tropical parrot inspired crop jacket was n't so pretty what would the @entity45 say ? @entity20 's entry in the 2002 , @entity48 , makes the country ' proud ' in her demure @entity20 attire not all white ! @entity53 's entry for the @entity54 , @entity55 , was keen to show off his freshly shaved chest and toned torso in his @entity60 white t - shirt hair - raising attire ! @entity63 's entry for the @entity54 , @entity64 , second right , does n't exactly blend into the crowd in her camouflage is tight really alright ? @entity29 , left , and @entity67 , centre and right , went for cheap and cheerful when selecting their outfits - at least @entity29 opted for a low key hair shade tribal style : the ' @entity74 ' band from @entity75 wear their table cloths to perform the song ' @entity78 during the dress rehearsal in 2005 heads ! the lead singer of @entity83 's @entity82 causes a safety hazard as he swings his microphone - at least it takes attention away from his leggings and feather boa monochrome madness : luckily the @entity92 's 2002 entry , @entity93 , brought her tent along in case the local hotels were fully booked @entity97 : 2006 's @entity99 winners , @entity100 , celebrate their victory in the @entity6 ... but seem to have scared off most of the audience dare to bare : so tight was the wardrobe budget some years , @entity104 , left , from @entity105 , @entity75 's representative @entity106 , centre , and @entity108 , right , were n't offered real clothes and had to make do with treating the audience of @entity112 music fans to a performance in their underwear not so heavenly ! @entity116 of @entity117 perform in 2008 in bizarre angel - inspired ensembles - complete with vast fluffy white wings hats off for effort ! ' @entity74 ' of @entity75 perform in 2011 with ice cream cone ( or @entity123 ) inspired headgear if you 're not @entity126 , you ca n't pull it off ! @entity53 's @entity128 , who performed with singer , @entity131 , sported pleated kilts in last year 's competition that outfit is out of this world ! @entity137 's @entity136 , left , performs in a bizarre spacesuit - inspired ensemble on last year 's show , while @entity75 's @entity141 , right , who also entered the @entity6 last year , gets the audience all fired up in her @entity143 inspired gown what is that all about ? @entity147 's @entity146 performed at the contest two years running - and on both occasions , sported eye - wateringly silly outfits good luck ! @entity20 's @entity19 hopes to win this year 's event with @entity153 but @entity155 's @entity154 ( right ) is the bookmaker 's favourite			1
