@entity18 , 53 , and @entity163 , 61 , have been arrested after police found their two **eldest** adopted daughters emaciated and abused
@entity11 , @entity88 couple adopted the 13 - and 11 - year old girls five years *ago*
officials likened the **eldest** girl 's condition to that of a ' concentration camp survivor ' as she had leathery skin from repeated beatings
couple had two younger adopted children as well but they appear to have been ' their *favorites* ' as they were not as badly treated
made the older girls run in *scorching* heat and *defecate* in buckets outside
had to memorize @entity16 verses and were only given diapers as rewards but were forced to wear no other *clothes*
