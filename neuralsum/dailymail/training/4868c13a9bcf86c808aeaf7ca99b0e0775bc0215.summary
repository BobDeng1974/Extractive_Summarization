@entity1 's inspiration and a favourite hideaway on the coast of @entity4 , @entity5 , will after all be fitted with 200 controversial solar panels following dramatic objections from locals			1
the proposed set of eco-panels have been described by a former owner as ' horrific ' and a neighbour as ' a monstrous carbuncle on an old friend ' during the development application process			2
but it has finally concluded with @entity18 parish council being over-ruled by its ' big brother ' @entity20 , who have approved the addition			1
the historic @entity5 will have 200 controversial solar panels fitted after council gave approval fierce opposition by a former owner and local parish council was over-ruled by @entity20 officers one person in opposition to the changes claimed the ' @entity31 ' and ' @entity33 ' author would ' turn in her grave ' at the thought of the 1930s @entity36 hotel near @entity37 being ' scarred ' by the 21st century solar panels			1
but planners thought otherwise and have granted permission to current owners @entity42 and @entity43 to go ahead with the Â£ 50,000 project after they submitted revised plans			1
they say the panels would enable the hotel to produce 10 per cent of its heating and lighting bill from renewable energy - sustainable for the environment and their business			2
mrs @entity43 said : ' the parish council of @entity18 has always been very hostile to anything we 've proposed for @entity5			1
i think their opposition to this plan was borne out of malice			0
' we 're really pleased that common sense has prevailed			0
this is not a solar farm to sell energy to the grid , this is a small array to make our business more resilient to energy market fluctuations			2
it will help cut our energy bills by 10 per cent			0
' mrs @entity43 said she had considered a wind turbine for the island but instead went with a plan to use state - of - the - art solar panels from @entity79 - based company @entity78			1
the beautiful island served as inspiration for the novels by legendary crime author @entity1 the plans for the 200 solar panels , which were on display on the @entity20 website the hotel was frequently visited by @entity1 , who used the setting as inspiration for a number of her novels including ' @entity92 ' and ' @entity93 ' , a @entity95 mystery			1
several local residents said the panels , which will be fitted on disused tennis courts , would spoil the beauty of the hotel			1
@entity20 planning officers ' report said : ' the sensitivity of @entity5 is fully acknowledged			1
' the proposed solar array would actually represent a very minor change to it			2
any harm caused by the proposed development to the character of @entity5 and its famous listed hotel is considered to be very slight			2
' @entity43 , pictured with co-owner @entity42 , is ' really pleased that common sense has prevailed ' @entity1 used the setting as inspiration for a number of her novels including ' @entity93 ' mrs @entity43 said the panels should be in place by april once the finances for the scheme have been secured : ' this is a rational decision which we always thought would be made , correctly , on the grounds of public policy , political guidance , best practice and - most importantly - the desirability of sustainable energy for our country			1
guests can walk to the island at low tide or catch this sea tractor across to the hotel ' @entity4 , and the @entity134 , are at the forefront of the sustainable energy drive and will be its standard bearer into the next decade			1
' there are more homes and businesses using solar energy in the @entity142 than in @entity143			0
' the project had received support from the @entity147 and @entity148 , she said			0
' we feel strongly that sustainable energy is best practice where ever it can be employed , even in the context of listed buildings			0
' in this , we are following a modern and progressive path that would have been recognised by the original pioneers of @entity5 in the 1920s and ' 30s			2
' @entity5 was one of the founder members of @entity160 , taking a @entity162 award at its inception in 2003 and holding gold since 2010			2
' parish councillor @entity165 said while she agreed with the ' need for sustainability and finding alternative methods of producing power ' the area is one of ' outstanding natural beauty			0
' ' it 's a historic island so it is totally inappropriate and out of place , ' she said			0
former owner @entity175 , who sold the island in 2001 , previously stated he was ' horrified ' by the proposal and said the panels would have appalled @entity1			1
' we spent 16 years doing everything we could to restore it to its former beauty , ' he said			0
' now this green island sleeping in the sun is going to be scarred by this horrible shiny thing			2
it will be visible from miles away			0
it is going to glint in the sun and spoil the whole thing			0
' mrs @entity43 says the council 's decision was ' rational ' after the @entity18 parish 's hostile opposition to plans the solar panels will be fitted on a disused tennis court and be obscured by hedges , says mrs @entity43 mrs @entity43 says the panels will be non-reflective and be obscured by hedges			1
@entity201 , whose home overlooks the island said : ' this would be a monstrous carbuncle on an old friend			0
it would be ruinous for the beauty of the island			0
' @entity210 , of @entity211 , said : ' as a feature the island is known around the world so this is bound to prove controversial and stir up a huge amount of interest			0
' a spokesman for @entity219 said : ' i do n't think this type of planning application has been put forward for the island before , but every application is looked at individually on its merits			0
' @entity5 is about 820ft from @entity18 , and accessible by foot at low tide or by a sea tractor .			1
