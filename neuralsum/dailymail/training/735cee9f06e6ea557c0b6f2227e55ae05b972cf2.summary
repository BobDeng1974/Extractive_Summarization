the @entity0 and @entity1 won a landmark legal case yesterday blocking further publication of topless photographs of @entity1			0
judges banned @entity7 magazine closer from selling or republishing the pictures and said its decision to use them had been a ‘ brutal ’ invasion of the couple ’s privacy			1
however , the injunction was branded a ‘ hollow victory ’ because more than 500,000 copies of the magazine have already been sold , about 100,000 more then normal			2
click here for latest video thrilled : the giggling @entity21 couple will be over the moon as they end their jubilee tour as their lawyers won a landmark injunction in a @entity28 court today and there were fears that the ruling would do little to halt the worldwide spread of the pictures because the magazine does not own the copyright			1
a freelance photographer based in @entity7 is understood to have taken the ‘ particularly intrusive ’ pictures and sold them to @entity38			1
he or she is thought to own the copyright			0
the @entity7 judicial system has so far been unable to discover the name of the photographer			1
as a result , no injunction banning him from selling the pictures in @entity7 or around the world can be put in place			1
this means that although @entity52 and @entity1 have won their hearing , they have been unable to ban any future sales			0
historic : the publication of the topless photos prompted the @entity21 couple to sue over their privacy for the first time - securing a ruling , pictured , preventing further distribution of the images triggering the storm : @entity7 @entity38 ( left ) was the first to publish the naked pictures of the @entity0			1
now @entity66 ( right ) , the @entity7 lawyer , has successfully challenged them in court @entity69 for the day : @entity52 and @entity1 are carried on their royal duties during a visit to @entity73 in @entity74 shortly after the images were published friendly welcome : @entity52 and @entity1 are carried from their private jet in @entity74 , where thousands greeted them on the small cluster of islands battle : tacky @entity85 magazine @entity84 was the latest to publish the topless pictures of @entity1 - owned by the same company as @entity7 closer privacy row : the @entity90 ( above ) in @entity91 , on the outskirts of @entity28 , has heard representations from the royals as they begin legal action against the publishers of @entity7 closer magazine how it was done : the photographer who took the controversial pictures most likely took them from this spot on a @entity104 road overlooking the chateau dream home : the royal couple relaxed and had fun at @entity109 , pictured , not knowing they were being spied on @entity111 has removed copies of @entity7 closer containing naked photos of the @entity1			1
upset members have been contacting management demanding they are pulled down			0
' following strong feedback from the @entity111 community , we will be removing these items , and are already in the process of doing so , ' an @entity111 spokesman said			0
copies of @entity7 closer magazine featuring topless photos of the @entity1 were doing a roaring trade on the @entity128 version of the online auction site			1
some users had been selling the magazine , which is otherwise not available to buy in the @entity128 , since it first hit the shelves last week			0
multiple listings for the magazine were live on the site , with one offering a ' buy it now ' price of £ 35 with the seller ' huni - pie ' leaving a note reading : ' closer magazine in french bought back from @entity28 today has photos of the royals topless			1
' another copy attracted 12 bids before it sold for £ 31.01			0
@entity146 users have also been using the networking site to distribute copies among themselves			0
user @ kasabianite tweeted four days ago : ' if any of my followers are in @entity7 id appreciate it if they ’d go to the shop & buy a copy of closer magazine , i ’ll dm my address			1
' the judges said the magazine ’s use of the photos was a ‘ brutal exhibition ’ of the couple ’s intimacy			0
last night a @entity7 legal source told the @entity169 : ‘ this ruling is all about stopping closer from publishing more pictures			1
although it is an important legal step for @entity52 and @entity1 , it does n’t stop more pictures from being published because we ca n’t find the photographer			2
to some extent it ’s a hollow victory			0
‘ however , a @entity7 judge would certainly take a dim view of any @entity7 paper or magazine which decided to print the pictures after this ruling			1
’ in a written judgment handed down at the @entity180 in @entity91 , a suburb of @entity28 , judges agreed that the couple ‘ could legitimately suppose ’ the chateau they were staying in ‘ was sheltered from prying eyes ’			1
closer magazine was also ordered to hand over all files containing the intimate images to representatives of the couple within 24 hours			1
@entity188 , the glossy magazine ’s publisher , faces a fine of £ 8,000 for every day it refuses to hand over the pictures			2
the company was also ordered to pay £ 1,600 in court costs			0
such sums are meagre given the huge success of the latest edition of @entity38 , which features the pictures of a topless @entity1			1
closer will be fined £ 80,000 if it sells the pictures to another publication , the judgment states			1
publication of the photos , taken in @entity104 on september 5 , was also banned ‘ on digital tablets ’			2
royal lawyers did not ask for any remaining copies of the magazine to be removed from newsagents because ‘ the damage has already been done ’			2
last night a royal source said @entity52 and @entity1 were delighted with the decision			0
‘ they welcome the injunction that ’s been granted , ’ the source said			0
‘ they always believed the law was broken and that they were entitled to their privacy			0
’ the @entity0 and @entity1 have also filed a criminal complaint under @entity7 ’s privacy laws			1
if closer is found guilty it could be fined up to £ 36,000 and its editor could , in theory at least , serve up to a year in prison			2
however , publications in @entity7 often flout privacy laws because they know that fines are small and prison sentences rarely handed out			1
on monday their lawyer @entity231 told the court that the photos revealed ‘ particularly simple and deeply intimate moments in the life of this couple that have no reason to be on a magazine cover ’			2
he went on to say that the @entity1 is ‘ a young woman , not an object ’			0
@entity52 and @entity1 are prepared to devote years to legal battles pursuing those responsible for the topless pictures – or those who publish them			2
sources close to the couple confirmed they were under no illusions about the length of time it could take for their fight to make its way through the @entity28 courts			0
but they insist that the @entity0 and @entity1 will press ahead because they feel so strongly about the invasion of their privacy			0
this morning , the couple ’s complaint against @entity7 closer magazine – the first to publish the images – is to be heard at the @entity90 in the @entity28 suburb of @entity91			1
they have instructed @entity28 barrister @entity66 to call for ‘ the stiffest punishment possible ’ against the magazine			0
@entity266 said there were plans to press for criminal charges against the photographer – who has so far remained unidentified			0
the @entity0 and @entity1 are also considering action against the @entity273 edition of the @entity274 , which printed the pictures on saturday			2
