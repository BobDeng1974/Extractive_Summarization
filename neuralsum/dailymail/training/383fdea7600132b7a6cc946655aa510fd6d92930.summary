by @entity0 published : 03:23 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 05:20 est , 13 march 2013 pressure : sir @entity2 was in charge of the regional health authority responsible for @entity5 when ' the appalling and unnecessary suffering of people ' took place - but will not resign civil servants ' neutered ' the @entity11 report into 1,200 deaths at the @entity15 hospital trust to protect the @entity16 over his role in @entity19 ’s worst - ever health scandal , an expert said today			1
professor @entity20 , who was a key figure in highlighting sky - high death rates at @entity24 , said the final version of the £ 13million report was ' muted ' and failed to mention criticisms of sir @entity2 given in evidence			1
sir @entity2 , dubbed the man with no shame , is under huge pressure to leave his role after presiding over the @entity15 scandal			1
many mps , relatives of the 1,200 dead and health service professionals believe patient care will not improve under his leadership , but the @entity42 chief executive maintains there is no chance he will resign			2
@entity46 's damning 1,782 page report shocked @entity19 after it found ‘ failures at every level ’ which led to the scandal , while not a single nurse or doctor has been disciplined or struck - off			2
patients at @entity53 were left lying in their own urine and excrement for days , forced to drink water from vases , given the wrong medication or sent home with life - threatening conditions			0
' i feel the final report was muted			2
the 2010 report and the closing submissions to the @entity11 inquiry were much clearer with regards to the evidence , ' professor @entity20 told the @entity69			1
' you have to remember that the final version of these inquiries are written up by @entity74 officials			0
although professor @entity20 admits it is ' difficult to prove ' @entity79 was seeking to protect sir @entity2 , he added : ' i think it probably has the effect of protecting him			1
' professor @entity20 claims that the report only briefly mentioned an allegation that sir @entity2 told hospital regulators to ignore campaign group cure the @entity42 , set up by family and friends of those who died at unnecessarily @entity24			1
tomorrow sir @entity2 will come under further pressure when he appears before mps on the @entity93			1
they are expected to ask him why he ignored warnings from relatives about @entity15 a year before the scandal came to light			2
fury : relatives and campaigners who lost loved - ones blame sir @entity2 for not getting to grips with problems on his watch the @entity11 report was put together with the help of civil servant @entity108 , the inquiry 's secretary			1
disagreeing with professor @entity20 , @entity110 , solicitor to the @entity111 , said , ’ to suggest that the report was “ neutered ” by “ mandarins ” is wholly wrong			1
the @entity74 was not given a draft of the report and therefore did not “ write up ” the final or any version of it			0
the decisions about what went into the report were the chairman ’s			0
@entity108 was seconded from his job at the @entity74 and acted entirely independently of the @entity74 as secretary to the inquiry			0
’ a spokesman for @entity46 said that professor @entity20 's allegations were ' unfounded concerns '			1
' the report was written by the chairman with the editorial support of his inquiry team , ' the spokesman said			0
' this team included the secretary to the inquiry who was seconded on a full time basis from the @entity74 to work for the inquiry , but who has acted throughout independently of the @entity74 , and subject to the instructions and decisions of the chairman			0
' the @entity74 was not given any draft of the report and therefore did not “ write up ” the final or any version of the report			0
the decisions about what went into the report were the chairman ’s			0
' sir @entity2 has faced growing calls to resign since a report criticised him for his role in the @entity15 hospital scandal , where up to 1,200 died needlessly			1
last thursday , for the first time since the report was published three weeks ago , he met directors from the @entity155			0
families of patients who suffered poor care at @entity15 had attended the meeting in the hope that sir @entity2 would be given a vote of no - confidence			1
but they left the room when the chairman of the board , professor @entity164 , made it very clear that sir @entity2 would be staying in his £ 211,000 - a - year post			1
struggle : sir @entity2 has faced calls to resign since a report implicated him in the @entity15 hospital scandal - but experts say it was ' neutered ' to ' protect him ' earlier , when sir @entity2 was asked if there was any chance he would resign , he defiantly replied ‘ no ’			1
backing : health secretary @entity175 and other cabinet members continue to support sir @entity2 in his job addressing the meeting later , he said : ‘ as many of you know i ’m very passionate about improving services for patients			2
' i ’m very ambitious about the @entity42 and what that sometimes turns into is intolerance of poor performance which results in the kind of response “ just get it right ” when actually we need to be more reflective , think about why people are doing the things they do			0
' patient safety is the top of the tree			0
we need zero tolerance of failures of patient safety			0
’ sir @entity2 was in charge of the regional body supposedly overseeing @entity15 but which failed to pick up on the horrific standards of care			1
as chief executive of the @entity74 , he is said to have dismissed warnings from relatives of patients who died , saying they were ‘ simply lobbying			0
’ a group of 20 members of @entity209 the @entity42 staged a silent protest outside the building in @entity212 where the meeting was held			0
some carried placards with the words ‘ the man with no shame ’ while others held up pictures of a gravestone with the words ‘ too many deaths , no accountability ’			2
@entity225 , 51 , who founded the group after her mother @entity227 died at the trust said : ‘ our long campaign for a public inquiry into what happened at @entity53 will have been pointless if this man remains in charge of the @entity42			2
‘ he ’s part of the problem , and while he ’s still there we have no faith that the health service will be led towards the caring culture it needs			0

criticisms of sir @entity2 omitted from @entity11 report , expert says
' i think it probably has the effect of protecting him , ' professor @entity20
' man with no shame ' continues to refuse to resign over @entity24 scandal
sir @entity2 was in charge of body that failed to spot horrific standards of care
