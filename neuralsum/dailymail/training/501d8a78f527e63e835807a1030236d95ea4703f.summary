by @entity0 children 's books are becoming increasingly violent because they have to compete with gory video games , a bestselling children 's author has claimed			1
writer @entity6 – whose hit @entity8 series has sold more than eight million copies worldwide – said youngsters are more and more desensitised to violence because they see it so often on their tv and computer screens			1
but he said he is happy to put ' brutal ' material in books as long as it passes what he terms the ' @entity19 test ' , meaning anything that would be seen on the gritty @entity22 soap is acceptable in his own stories			1
author @entity6 says children are comfortable with violent scenes in books after watching action films and playing gory computer games mr @entity6 also hit out at ' white , grey - haired , elderly ' writers such as @entity33 author @entity32 and @entity34 , saying they are seen as ' deeply uncool ' and turn teenagers off books			1
he told the @entity37 : ' my competition is not @entity40 or @entity41			0
my competition is @entity42 and @entity43 and the @entity45 movie			0
' i think if you make kids ' books too twee and say there should be no violence and they should all be about nice cosy little worlds , it is like fighting with one arm tied behind your back			1
' i think my @entity19 test is quite a nice one , because it is still the most watched programme in the country by teens			2
when i 'm writing something i ask ' would this get by in an episode of @entity19 ? ' in 2011 , mr @entity6 's books were banned from the library of @entity64 junior school in north @entity65 after parents complained they were unsuitable for their children			1
mr @entity6 says he is competing with computer games like the @entity69 ( pictured ) rather than ' @entity40 ' the 41 - year - old claims it was a misunderstanding prompted when he was booked to speak to the school 's primary age children			1
he said he would never recommend his own cherub novels – about a division of the @entity77 intelligence services that recruit young orphans as agents – to anyone under the age of 12			0
but he claimed the recent bestseller @entity83 has raised the bar of what is acceptable in children 's literature			2
he said : ' children of nine and ten are reading @entity83 and it is such an incredibly violent book			1
it is basically a book about kids thrown into an arena to kill each other			0
in terms of violence that is a real game changer			0
' he added : ' sometimes people say to me the violence in your books is brutal and nasty and depicted in detail			2
i actually think that is quite important			0
' if someone in my book gets punched in the face the next day they have a swollen eye , and maybe they have to go to hospital to have a detached retina looked at , and maybe they feel guilty about it			0
what i dislike is cartoonish violence			0
' i do n't put in graphic sex scenes , and the swear words are pretty tame			0
and if children do n't like it , they will self - censor and put it down			2
' mr @entity6 insisted authors need to keep younger readers interested , even if it means including material that would have been deemed unacceptable in the past			2
he said : ' we went through this phase with children 's laureates , with @entity34 and @entity32 and @entity135 and they were all these white , grey haired elderly people			0
' they would all be on the news talking about the nice cosy world of children 's books and how lovely it was to sit in a library			1
and i was sat there thinking about 12 and 13 year old kids who would think how uncool it all was , and why would they ever bother reading books			1
