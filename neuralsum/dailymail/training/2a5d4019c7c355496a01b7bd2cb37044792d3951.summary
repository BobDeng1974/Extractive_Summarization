by @entity0 for most holidaymakers , there 's enough fear of heights to be had from the @entity5 or the @entity6			0
clearly these are not living on the edge enough for @entity9 - who dangled a ' free climber ' off the side of a 377ft - high bridge in the @entity13 holding only his wrist			1
the thrillseeker known only as @entity16 is the leader of an urban free climbing craze in @entity19 , which sees young people tackling ever - larger monuments with no harnesses			1
a new documentary shows him teaming up with the thrillseeker , donning camera helmets and crawling fast up the side of the bridge , which carries several lanes of traffic over the @entity57 in the @entity25 capital @entity59			0
they reach the apex of the bridge and @entity16 rubs his hands together , preparing them for the big stunt			1
he and @entity65 then secure their grip - before @entity16 dangles perilously over the side of the bridge , one slip from certain death			2
the film follows @entity9 near his @entity47 home , climbing 500ft structures , and on an out - of - the - ordinary pilgrimage to the @entity13 - said to be the spiritual home of urban free climbing			1
daring or idiotic : the film shows @entity25 thrillseeker @entity16 scale the metal cables of a bridge @entity81 : as the pair ( @entity9 behind ) climb higher , they rise above billboards and electricity wires fearless : gradually they recede until they are almost impossible to make out against the sky sweaty ? @entity16 dries his hands on his trousers before attempting the feat he grabs the wrist of 23 - year - old @entity9 ... and lowers himself off the side of the bridge a @entity98 spokesman said the show , which could attract controversy , will come with a warning there he teams up with @entity16 and on camera they climb derelict buildings and tightrope - walk hundreds of feet above the city , before their final stunt at its iconic bridge			1
a @entity98 spokesman said the documentary , to be shown tonight , explores ' one of the world 's most dangerous and most terrifying new crazes '			0
the young daredevils climb cranes and derelict buildings illegally for the ultimate adrenaline fix - and one which could well cost them their lives			2
the spokesman added : ' @entity9 's actions are clearly set in context in the programme			0
it will be proceeded by an appropriate warning and @entity98 in no - way condones or encourages his behaviour			0
' @entity128 airs tonight ( sunday , january 19 ) on @entity98 at 9pm .			0
