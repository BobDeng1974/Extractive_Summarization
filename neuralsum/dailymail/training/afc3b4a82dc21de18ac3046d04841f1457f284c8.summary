by @entity0 published : 07:40 est , 22 february 2013 updated : 10:20 est , 22 february 2013 a bungling beautician manages to burn off a chunk of her hair as she demonstrates how , or rather how not , to use a set of curling tongs			1
the hapless instructor , named @entity7 , who is believed to be from the @entity8 , begins her tutorial by taking a length of her hair and wrapping it around the electric curler			1
' so basically , if you want medium curls , maybe take a piece about this big , ' she begins , holding the section of hair between her fingers			2
but as she pulls the iron away from her head with the intention of showing of a bouncing curl , she pulls the entire chunk of her hair out with it , leaving just a singed stump			2
there is a brief moment between her noticing the hair is still attached to the iron and the grim realisation of what has just happened sinking in			0
horror : @entity45 pulls the iron away from her head - and her hair with it oops : @entity7 shows off the curling tongs with the length of her hair still attached some have suggested the video may be a spoof , although the look of sheer horror on her face would be hard to feign			0
she then whispers : ' you 're kidding me '			0
to her credit @entity7 reappears on the camera to say : ' well i just burnt my hair off ! ' and still went ahead and posted the video on @entity64 anyway			1
and she also manages to joke about the incident on her @entity67 page where she has gathered quite a following .			0
