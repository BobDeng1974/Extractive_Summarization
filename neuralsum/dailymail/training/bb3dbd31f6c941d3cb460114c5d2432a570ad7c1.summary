by @entity0 and @entity1 created : 02:21 est , 16 october 2013 every household in @entity3 will be required to separate their recycling from general waste from 2015 under new @entity8 rules			1
councils across @entity10 and @entity11 have been told they have to follow @entity8 guidance that will require paper , metal , glass and plastic to be collected separately from other rubbish			1
while the new directive does not specifically require this , and it will be the responsibility of each local authority to put in place the most effective policy for their local area , campaigners fear that homeowners will be forced to have yet more bins outside their properties			1
rubbish collection system : @entity29 and @entity30 with the nine different categories of rubbish they are forced to sort through in @entity34 - under - @entity35 , @entity36			0
such recycling division is not part of the @entity8 guidance			2
lord @entity39 , a minister in the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , has written to all local authorities to warn them about the new @entity8 directive			1
under the @entity45 , councils must collect different types of waste separately			1
the new rules are being brought in to help councils meet the @entity8 target of recycling 50 per cent of all household waste by 2020			1
@entity52 blight : councils across the country must collect paper , metal , plastic and glass separately from 2015 but the responsibility will lie with the local authority , not the homeowner some councils across the country have as many as nine different bins to sort their rubbish into , according to a study by the @entity67 in 2011			1
homeowners in @entity69 , @entity36 , have to split their rubbish into nine different receptacles			0
their rubbish gets divided between bins for : - refuse , food ( kitchen ) , food ( kerbside ) , cardboard , plastics paper , glass & cans , textiles and garden waste			1
the study found 21 councils across the country collect rubbish from seven or more bins , 58 collect from six or more bins and 136 collect from five or more bins			0
in his letter , @entity90 wrote to councils : ' where waste paper , metal , plastic or glass has been collected separately all reasonable steps must be taken to keep that stream separate from other waste streams wherever this is necessary to provide high - quality recyclates			1
‘ i look to local authorities actively to address these problems , by the effective implementation of the new regulations and by tackling problems with operating practices			2
’ campaigners have claimed that the new rules will force homeowners to have yet more bins outside their properties			0
however , lord @entity112 insisted households would not necessarily need more bins and could follow other councils which already operate a ‘ kerbside sort system ’ where materials are sorted before being loaded into the waste collection vehicle			1
he added : ‘ i am aware that this is a challenging time for local government as budgets reduce and expectations increase			0
i would urge all local authorities to work more closely with each other to sharpen procurement practices and share both facilities and services where possible			2
’ @entity128 , spokeswoman for the @entity129 , said that more bins would create problems			0
' contamination has been a long - standing problem since fortnightly residual waste collections were introduced , ' she told the @entity135			0
' there is a need for higher quality recyclate but the system must be easy to use for residents			0
' multiple plastic crates for individual sorting of materials will create a storage problem for many residents			0
' waste : councils are expected to recycle 50 per cent of all rubbish by 2020 under @entity8 targets under the @entity151 , councils will have to collect paper , metal , plastic and glass separately from 2015			1
the new rules are being brought in as part of a drive to cut the amount of waste being thrown into landfill to 50 per cent by 2020			2
separately , 70 per cent of waste from construction and demolition projects must be recycled by 2020			0
local @entity166 mp @entity165 said : ' this government is standing up for hard - working families , by working to increase the quality and frequency of recycling and rubbish collections			2
' recent @entity175 / @entity174 polling shows that residents ' satisfaction with both has risen , at the same time that council tax has been kept down			0
' councils need to adopt a common sense approach , to make it easier for families to go green and reduce the amount thrown away in landfill dumps			0
' there is no @entity186 directive saying that families must be overloaded with multiple bins			0
indeed , this government has recently issued new guidance to help tackle bin blight , due to homes not having proper bin storage			0
' a spokesman for @entity40 said that local authorities would not necessarily be forced to bring in new recycling bins if rubbish is sorted at the kerbside			1
' from 2015 it will be a legal requirement to collect paper , metal , plastic and glass waste materials separately , ' he said			1
' this does not mean that mixed waste bin collections can not continue ; it is up to local authorities to decide what works best in their local area within the law			2

paper , metal , glass and plastic will all have to be collected separately from other waste
changes brought in to meet @entity8 target of recycling 50 *%* of waste by 2020
some councils already ask homeowners to separate out their rubbish into nine different bins
campaigners fear directive will lead to an increase of bins outside homes
an earlier *version* of this *article* said that under the @entity45 , every household in @entity3 would be expected to separate their recycling into four separate boxes . in fact , while the @entity45 does enforce the separate collection of recyclables , local authorities can comply without requiring households to use separate bins for four types of recycling . we are happy to *clarify* this .
