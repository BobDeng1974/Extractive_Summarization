by @entity0 a mother has finally received an apology from health chiefs – four years after her premature baby was left to die in her arms by a hospital			2
@entity7 was left cradling her tiny son , @entity8 , for 46 minutes until he stopped breathing as staff ignored her desperate pleas for help			1
he had been born at 22 weeks , but miss @entity7 was not told that the hospital did not resuscitate babies born before 23 weeks			1
if she had known , she could have gone to another hospital , which might have tried to help her child			0
memory box : first - time mother @entity7 , 34 , cradled her newborn son @entity8 in her arms until he died a coroner has now ruled that @entity19 in @entity20 made a series of errors in its care of mother and son			1
miss @entity7 , whose relationship with @entity8 ’s father collapsed after the tragedy , said she was ‘ ecstatic ’ with the result but added : ‘ it does n’t bring @entity8 back			1
’ ‘ it has been an incredibly difficult four years since the death of my baby boy in horrendous circumstances , ’ she said			0
‘ i have finally received an apology and the coroner has found that the trust failed in its care of me and my baby			0
this ordeal has brought about significant change at the hospital , and the fact that no other mother will go through what i went through is a positive i will cherish			0
sadness : miss @entity7 has since received an unreserved apology from the hospital , which has fully accepted its failings and put in place stringent new guidelines and training to ensure this never happens again ‘ i want mothers - to - be up and down the country to be aware of my case and the fact that each trust has its own guidelines			1
’ miss @entity7 , 34 , of @entity59 , near @entity60 , was having a normal pregnancy until march 4 , 2010 , when she developed excruciating stomach pains			1
@entity19 said it could not help babies born under 23 weeks because their quality of life would be impaired if they were resuscitated			1
one in every nine babies in @entity67 is born either sick or premature - before 37 weeks of gestation , according to the charity @entity70			2
only 9 per cent born in the 23rd week of pregnancy survive , and just 14 per cent of 23 - week babies live after being resuscitated			1
it is routine practice in @entity67 to resuscitate babies born between 23 and 25 weeks , but individual @entity75 can decide their own policies on babies born at 22 to 23 weeks			1
in other countries such as @entity79 , there is a policy not to intervene with babies born at 23 weeks and let them die a dignified death			1
she was put in a private room at @entity19 and when staff told her the baby might arrive early she begged them to do everything they could to keep it alive			2
after three days a midwife broke her waters with what @entity89 believes was a large pair of scissors and she gave birth to her 1lb son shortly afterwards			2
describing the traumatic experience , she said : ‘ they put him in my arms and he cried and was wriggling around			0
i could feel him breathing and see his eyelashes and toes			0
‘ but i kept thinking , “ where ’s the incubator ? ” we were begging the midwives to do something to help him but no one was saying anything			0
he was not stillborn , he was trying to live			0
‘ if they had tried for an hour and said they could n’t do anything more for him or he was severely brain - damaged that would have been different , but he was n’t given a chance			0
’ the inquest at @entity116 heard that @entity89 was not told of the resuscitation policy until six weeks later during a meeting with senior staff			2
coroner @entity120 last week recorded a verdict of death from natural causes and said failings in the care provided ‘ did not affect the outcome ’			0
babies born at 22 weeks have about a 1 per cent chance of survival			1
following her ordeal , miss @entity7 has given birth to a daughter , @entity132 , at a different hospital			1
she also arrived prematurely , at 24 weeks , but is now a healthy little girl			0
let down : @entity8 was delivered 22 weeks and two days into her pregnancy at @entity19 ( pictured ) miss @entity7 received undisclosed damages from @entity19 in january			1
it has since introduced reforms including annual training for staff on procedures			0
chief nurse @entity142 said : ‘ we again offer our sincere condolences to @entity89 on the loss of her baby			0
since that time we have carried out a great deal of work to improve our internal policy for babies born prematurely			2
’ payout : @entity7 ( right ) with her solicitor @entity151 ( left ) , a clinical negligence partner at @entity153			0

@entity7 , 34 , cradled her newborn son @entity8 in her arms until he died
no workers at @entity19 tried to resuscitate him or *comfort* her
@entity8 was delivered 22 weeks and two days into pregnancy in march 2010
but hospital had a policy of not resuscitating babies born under 23 weeks
staff did *n't* *explain* this to her - and she only learned of it six weeks later
poor *communication* meant miss @entity7 was not told about the hospital ’s policy on resuscitation .
a *paediatrician* should have *explain*ed about the 23 - week rule before the birth and should have been present after delivery .
an *obstetric* *review* should have been carried out when miss @entity7 was admitted . a *consultant* did not see her until the next day .
she received inadequate *counselling* following the death of her son .
