according to conservationists the thriving legal trade in @entity11 is helping fuel the slaughter of elephants in @entity44 according to conservationists the thriving legal trade in @entity11 is helping fuel the slaughter of elephants in @entity44 , where the largest land mammals on earth are facing their worst poaching epidemic in decades			1
experts now believe more are being killed than are being born			0
the trade in ' blood ivory ' will be among the most critical issues to be debated at the 177 - nation @entity56 , or @entity56 , which will begin on sunday in @entity58			2
and @entity11 , which is hosting the meeting , will be under particular pressure to take action			2
it is not only a major hub for illegally trafficked wildlife - it is also where much of the ivory smuggled out of @entity44 ends up			1
' instead of being part of the problem , the @entity11 government can be part of the solution by banning ivory sales ' altogether within its borders , said @entity75 of the @entity76			2
last week , the conservation group presented a global petition with more than half a million signatures to @entity11 prime minister @entity80 , calling on her government to do just that			2
the trade is currently legal in @entity11 as long as it involves tusks that came from native herds that have been domesticated			1
@entity80 responded by saying she recognised the importance of elephant conservation and would take the plea into consideration			0
@entity11 wildlife officials have ruled out an all - out ban on ivory in the past because those @entity94 who legitimately own domesticated animals should also have the right to buy and sell tusks locally			1
but once ivory enters @entity11 markets either legally or illegally it is difficult to trace where it came from			1
nevertheless , ' most of the supply we see in @entity11 markets is illegally smuggled in from @entity44 , ' @entity75 said			1
@entity11 custom officials display seized ivory tusks during a news conference at the customs office of @entity109 in @entity58			1
@entity11 allows its nationals to trade in ivory from elephants that have died of natural causes inside its borders @entity11 is not only a major hub for illegally trafficked wildlife , it is also where much of the ivory smuggled out of @entity44 ends up @entity11 itself is home to about 6,500 elephants , of which 2,500 are wild and off - limits			1
of the remaining 4,000 , only 1,500 are males that produce tusks , and many grow only one in their lifetimes			0
by contrast , there are an estimated 5,000 ivory traders doing business in the country , far more than the local supply should be able to support , @entity75 said			0
@entity133 said the illegal wildlife trade is worth up to $ 20 billion per year globally			2
and to control it , the international community has to be willing to ' deploy the sorts of techniques that are being deployed with respect to narcotics , ' he said			0
around 70 years ago , up to 5 million elephants are believed to have roamed @entity44			1
today , just several hundred thousand are left , 25,000 of which were killed in 2011			1
figures for 2012 have yet to be released , but they are believed to be similar to the previous year , or worse , @entity133 said			0

a meeting to be held in @entity58 on sunday will put the spotlight on @entity11 's role in the illicit trade in @entity151 ivory @entity11 will host the convention on @entity153 and @entity154 ( @entity56 ) meeting from sunday until march 14 although all @entity151 states agree no elephant should be killed for its tusks , there is disagreement over how best to protect the iconic animals			1
some argue that legalising the ivory trade within reason give upon the animals a monetary worth that encourages humans to value their survival			0
but others say the only to stop poaching is to outlaw the sale of ivory everywhere , killing demand and ending their slaughter			0
@entity11 's government has said it has done what it can			0
in the past two years , customs officers here have seized close to 2,000 kilograms ( 4,409 pounds ) of @entity151 tusks , sometimes found broken apart into small pieces in failed attempts to avoid detection			0
@entity183 has called for @entity56 members to impose trade sanctions against @entity11 - along with @entity186 and @entity187 - alleging they are complicit in the illegal ivory trade			1
' there 's certainly an issue here , it 's been dealt with more slowly than many would like , ' @entity133 said			0
but sanctions , he said , were premature and @entity11 needs to be given the opportunity to put in place new measures to ensure they are ' not allowing laundered @entity151 ivory into this system			0

the tusks were legally trimmed to enable animals to eat more easily
but *campaigners* say @entity11 legal trade is fueling illegal slaughter in @entity44
70 years ago *5m* elephants are believed to have roamed @entity44
now , just several hundred thousand are left - and 25,000 were killed in 2011
