by @entity1 reporter a new exercise book called the @entity3 shows women in their second and third trimester flipping truck tires , swinging large hammers and leaping over barbells			1
written by @entity9 instructor @entity8 , and her exercise scientist husband @entity11 , the book is no way intended for exercise novices - but is it taking the idea of working out during pregnancy too far ? ' we were just documenting what i did during my two pregnancies , ' mrs @entity8 told @entity20			1
' we wanted to show women who are already in great shape that they can maintain a high level of fitness during pregnancy			1
' a new exercise book called the @entity3 shows women in their second and third trimester flipping truck tires , swinging large hammers and leaping over barbells in recent years , a growing number of women have chosen to continue their exercise programs throughout pregnancy , and mrs @entity8 emphasizes that she would not recommend following her book if ' you are n’t already doing it			1
' the couple also recommend that pregnant women follow their doctor ’s advice and listen to their own body in order to pull back from any movement that does n’t feel right			1
mrs @entity8 admitted that ' half the exercises in the book would have warnings , ' which are nowhere to be seen			1
in 1985 , the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) published its guidelines for prenatal exercise , cautioning women not to exceed a maximum heart rate of 140 beats per minute			2
' we wanted to show women who are already in great shape that they can maintain a high level of fitness during pregnancy ' dr. @entity58 , a lead author of the @entity46 guidelines for exercise and pregnancy , said that mothers - to - be should simply ask themselves how much risk they want to take			2
' consider that activities with a high risk of injury in someone who is n’t pregnant will have the risk amplified by some unknown factor for pregnant women , ' he said			2
when it comes to the effect of exercise on the fetus , there are three main areas of concern : hyperthermia , sports injuries and oxygen deficit			0
while exercise dramatically increases body temperature , where the fetus can take on the mother 's heat , possibly leading to birth defects , there is no research to prove that exercise at high intensities leads to an increase in birth defects			0
similarly , although studies have shown that when unfit women exercise at very high intensity levels , uterine blood flow decreases to the point where the fetus experiences a serious oxygen deficit , this has been shown to rarely occur when the pregnant woman is fit			0
written by @entity9 instructor @entity8 , and her exercise scientist husband @entity11 , the book is no way intended for exercise novices - but is it taking the idea of working out during pregnancy too far ? to prevent oxygen deficit to the fetus , they ought to breathe normally during strength training , because any act of breath holding can reduce oxygen delivery to the placenta			1
sports injuries are also a concern			0
doing deep squats , for example , is more likely to cause knee pain in pregnant women because of hormonal changes that can soften and weaken the joints , said dr @entity58			0
the @entity3 aims to provide practical information on how a woman 's body changes each month and how to gauge their own limits with workout plans for strength , cardiovascular conditioning , agility , and balance for each stage of pregnancy			0
while it is true that the duration , type and intensity of the exercise that pregnant women perform can all affect the fetus ’s heart rate , the @entity46 emphasizes that is they train regularly , the fetus will be better conditioned and able to adapt to the stresses of exercise			0
' the concern arises when a woman performs extreme levels of exercise on an inconsistent basis : then , the effect can be detrimental to the fetus , ' explains the @entity46 website .			0
