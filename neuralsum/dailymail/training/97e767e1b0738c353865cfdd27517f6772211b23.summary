@entity0 yesterday unveiled plans to soak the rich with taxes on mansions , large pension pots and second homes			1
the @entity7 propose investing in big projects such as building electric railways and 300,000 homes a year if they return to government after next may ’s election			1
and mr @entity0 admitted these would have to be funded by higher taxes on the well - off			1
his party ’s ‘ pre-manifesto ’ , a draft of its plans for office , contains the controversial pledge to impose a ‘ mansion tax ’ on homes worth more than £ 2million			1
he called for the rate to be ‘ more closely aligned with income tax ’ but would not give further details , saying it would have to be decided by the @entity39			2
both policies bring the party closer to @entity42 , which is hammering out plans for a tax on high - value homes and has said that it would look at the capital gains tax threshold			1
a @entity7 spokesman said there is evidence @entity50 is being used for tax avoidance as it is levied at a lower rate than income tax			2
wealthy people who receive some of their income from shares can pay the lower rate of @entity50			0
his party ’s ' pre-manifesto ' contains the controversial pledge to impose a ' mansion tax ' on homes worth more than £ 2million but higher rates would also hit those selling second homes in the @entity67 or holiday homes abroad			1
the tax is liable on any profit from the sale , and has been enforced with the threat of jail and fines in a recent crackdown by @entity76			0
in the past , senior @entity7 have suggested it could be increased to the same rate as income tax – 40p and 45p for higher and top - rate tax payers			1
but there is evidence from the @entity67 and abroad that raising the level of @entity50 fails to increase revenue as very wealthy businesspeople manage to avoid paying it or defer payment			0
the @entity7 would also reduce the level at which people are eligible for tax relief on their pension pots to £ 1million from the current £ 1.25million			2
their policy document says these measures would ‘ ensure that those with the highest incomes and wealth are making a fair contribution ’			0
but the @entity98 claimed the party ’s plans would cost up to £ 19billion more than claimed and would involve ‘ more taxes and more spending ’			0
a @entity7 spokesman denied this , saying the proposals would be costed next year			2
other measures in the ‘ pre-manifesto ’ include stricter laws to cut carbon			0
the @entity7 propose a ‘ decarbonisation target ’ which would mean 60 per cent of electricity must come from green energy by 2030			2
this could lead to higher energy bills for homes and businesses			0
the party also wants to give new fathers a ‘ use it or lose it ’ month off to spend with their newborn and introduce 20 hours a week of free childcare for working families			2
the @entity7 have called for a ban on jailing people caught with drugs for personal use			0
mr @entity0 wants drug users to be given treatment instead – and his party will look at introducing civil penalties for low level offences to avoid giving users a criminal record			1
the deputy prime minister said yesterday that sending young people caught with drugs to jail helped turn them into ‘ hardened criminals ’			0
but last night former conservative home affairs spokesman @entity140 said the plan was ‘ simplistic ’ as the threat of jail was known to deter users of hard drugs who have a ‘ corrosive effect on society ’			0
around 1,000 people are jailed every year for possessing drugs for personal use			0
half of these cases involve class a drugs such as heroin			0
also included in the document is a promise to give votes to 16 - year - olds in all elections and referenda			1
the @entity7 would pass a ‘ @entity161 ’ imposing tough targets for achieving clean air , clean water and creating more green space , as well as marine and coastal reserves they would build 300,000 homes a year ( compared to around 125,000 at present ) and launch a huge home insulation programme that would cost billions , with council tax rebates for those who take part			1
under - 21s would be given a discount bus pass so they can afford to travel to college or work , and the @entity7 would commit to end the use of landfill ‘ in a generation ’ by increasing recycling they would introduce a form of proportional representation for elections and reform the @entity184			1
the party would also enforce a @entity186 on press regulation along the lines recommended by @entity189 .			1

if @entity7 return to government in may , ' big projects ' would need funding
mr @entity0 said well - off would have to pay price - with mansion tax a priority
also wants capital gains tax raised , bringing *political* stance closer to @entity42
party would enforce @entity186 on press regulation in line with @entity189
and they even promise to give votes to 16 - year - olds in all elections
