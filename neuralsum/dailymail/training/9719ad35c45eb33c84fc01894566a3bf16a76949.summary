by @entity0 published : 06:49 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 08:22 est , 25 march 2013 the letters offer a glimpse into the mind and emotions of naturalist @entity5 @entity5 's grief over watching his daughter - in - law 's painful death days after giving birth to his first grandchild is laid bare in personal letters soon to be released online			1
the naturalist 's horror at watching @entity14 die in september 1876 is described in a series of letters he wrote to his best friend , the botanist @entity18			1
he wrote : ' i am sure you will pity us , when you hear that @entity14 , @entity23 ' wife was safely confined and was apparently going quite well when she was seized with convulsion which lasted for several hours , she then sunk into a stupor and i saw her expire at 7 o'clock this morning			1
' the fascinating letters , which have never yet been published , are to be published by @entity27 by its @entity28 later this month			0
@entity5 's daughter - in - law , @entity14 , was 26 when she died four days after giving birth to the naturalist 's first grandchild , @entity31			1
the child survived , and was brought up by his father , @entity23 , and his paternal grandparents			2
@entity23 , who worked closely with his father , was later said by @entity31 to have never recovered from watching his beloved wife die			1
@entity5 described her as ' a most sweet , gentle creature , with plenty of mind beneath , ' and wrote : ' thank @entity42 she ... never knew that she was leaving @entity43 and all of us for ever			2
' i can not think what will become of @entity43			0
she helped and encouraged him in his scientific work and whether he will ever have heart to go on again ... i can not conceive			0
' @entity51 , i know that you will forgive me pouring out my grief '			0
@entity5 was particularly close to @entity14 , who shared his interest in naturalism and was married to the one his seven children who most closely followed in his own footsteps			1
@entity23 , known as @entity43 , had recently decided against pursuing a career in medicine and had settled in the @entity61 village of @entity62 , where his parents lived , and begun work as @entity5 's personal secretary , assisting him with botanical research and correspondence			2
the four - page letter from @entity5 to his friend @entity18 tells of his daughter - in - law 's death ' i can not think what will become of @entity43 ' : @entity5 writes of his worries for his bereaved son @entity18 replied : ' my dear , dear @entity5 , i can not tell you how i feel for @entity43 and mrs @entity14 and yourself			1
' it seems to open up my own all too recent loss , and to depress me utterly - poor , poor @entity43 , my heart bleeds for him : they were so happy and she so loveable - how i envied them a few months ago ! ' @entity5 then wrote to @entity18 a few days later , saying : ' @entity14 had severe convulsions due to wrong action of the kidneys ; after the convulsions she sunk into a stupor from which she never rallied			1
' it is an inexpressible comfort that she never suffered & never knew she was leaving her beloved husband for ever			0
' it has been a most bitter blow to us all			0
' he added : ' i never saw anyone suffer so much as poor @entity43			0
he has gone to @entity95 to bury the body in a little church - yard amongst the mountains , & i do not know when he will return '			0
@entity99 , who edits the @entity28 , told @entity100 that @entity14 ' was a favourite with all the @entity5 family '			2
he said : ' @entity5 's letter to @entity18 after @entity14 's death also suggests the closeness that he feels for his son			1
this was very characteristic of @entity5 , who always showed a great deal of concern for his children and was frequently anxious about their future happiness			0
' the letters show another , deeply personal side to the naturalist @entity5 , who wrote @entity117 dr @entity99 added : ' @entity18 was @entity5 's closest friend and they corresponded over almost their entire adult lives , so there was a kind of bond there that was special			1
' they shared feelings which they did n't share with others , so this correspondence offers a wonderful insight into what it was like to be them			0
it shows us @entity5 from the inside rather than the public @entity5			0
' when there are moments of crisis they do share these moments with each other			0
' @entity23 went on to marry again twice , and his son @entity31 went on to be educated at @entity143 and @entity27 before becoming a golf writer			2
@entity5 and @entity18 , a botanist and explorer who later ran the @entity148 at @entity149 , had both lost children previously , and had poured out feelings to each other that they had not been able to tell others			1
the historic papers form part of the world 's largest collection of @entity5 's papers - some 9,000 letters - and will be released on the @entity28 website later this week .			2
