by @entity0 published : 11:54 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 12:29 est , 11 december 2013 a @entity2 father is fighting the state of @entity4 for his daughter that was given up in 2008 for adoption without his consent			2
@entity9 , 36 , of @entity10 , is in @entity11 for a three - day juvenile court hearing that will determine the fate of daughter @entity14 – he wants sole custody , the adoptive parents want a joint agreement			1
the case is in a @entity11 court because he filed an injunction there before the baby was born in @entity4			1
he wants his daughter back : @entity9 is in court this week to determine who will get custody of his daughter the joint custody agreement proposed by the adoptive parents , who are related to the six - year - old girl ’s biological mother , treats mr @entity9 ‘ like a divorced , out - of - state father with visitation rights , ’ he told the @entity31			1
mr @entity9 has been fighting for custody of his daughter since before she was born , he filed a court injunction while the mother was still pregnant after he learned of her plans to give the baby up for adoption			1
she traveled to @entity4 just before the young girl was born in 2008			0
she is accused by mr @entity9 of giving birth in the state to circumvent his filing for custody so she could give the baby to relatives			1
‘ it ’s just unbelievable that it can take a father five years to gain visitation , much less six years to get to who has the right to raise his child , ’ he told the paper			0
‘ @entity51 [ @entity52 ] should have every right to raise [ my ] child , ’ he added			0
mr @entity9 is n't opposed to having the adoptive parents in @entity14 's life , but he wants full custody of his daughter			2
' i want to to live with you ' : @entity14 did not want to go back to the @entity4 couple raising her , mr @entity9 claims a @entity11 court ruling in january of last year sided with mr @entity9 ’ contention that he was improperly barred from intervening to gain custody of his daughter			1
he has been gradually reintroduced into his daughter ’s life during visits to @entity4 in the time since that ruling			0
she even spent an extended period of time with him in @entity2			0
‘ the visit to @entity2 was very successful and @entity14 was so happy to meet a lot more of her family and to bond with her step sisters and brother , ’ he posted on @entity71 shortly after she left			0
‘ she said , ‘ i want to live with you … my other family is not my real family only you are , why do i have to live with them ? ’ he said she asked , before adding that it broke his heart , but had to let the court process play out			2
subsequent postings had mr @entity9 saying he had nothing but the best interests of his daughter at heart , and that the adoptive parents even tried to bully him into paying child support			0
‘ they messed with the wrong father , ’ he wrote			0
' @entity95 messed with the wrong father ' : mr @entity9 has vowed to fight for as long as it takes to gain custody of daughter @entity14 lawyers for both sides declined to speak to the @entity31 and were unable to be reached by @entity101 because they are in court			1
this case echoes a number of others recently that have garnered national attention as fathers fight to gain custody of children given up for adoption without their consent			1
the most recent involves 19 - year - old @entity112 , who is fighting for custody of son @entity114 after the child 's teen mother put her up for adoption when she could n't afford to raise him			1
this case has yet to be decided			0
the most famous case involves ' baby @entity119 , ' whose soldier father waged a custody war with her adoptive parents that saw the girl shuttled between @entity124 and @entity125 multiple times			2
he was almost arrested for refusing to hand her back to her adoptive parents after a court ruled he must , and then famously ended the custody battle in a teary - eyed press conference .			0

the girl 's biological mother gave birth and handed the baby to family *members* for adoption without father @entity9 ' consent
he has been in court trying to gain custody since before the now - six - year - old girl was born
he only *regained* *partial* custody this year , but a three - day hearing this week in @entity11 is set to determine who she will live with
