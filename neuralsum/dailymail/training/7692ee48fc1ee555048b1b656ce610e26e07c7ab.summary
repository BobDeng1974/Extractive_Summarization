by @entity1 reporter published : 23:18 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 02:58 est , 18 july 2013 @entity3 has issued an apology for the glaring error on a line of @entity8 t - shirts			1
while the team colors were right , and the @entity8 logo was correct , they were paired with the wrong state			2
instead of @entity13 , the t - shirts featured the unmistakable shape of @entity15 along with the letters ‘ @entity13			1
’ state of confusion : sports apparel giant @entity3 recently dropped the ball when it offered a @entity8 shirt that mixed up @entity15 and @entity13 those , of course , are the initials for @entity13			1
and though the @entity8 name is meant to invoke both states , the team plays home game at @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity13			1
the shirt sold for $ 32 , but was soon taken down from the company 's web store			2
the error was first reported on the sports blog of @entity34 columnist @entity33 , called @entity35			2
it was caught , @entity33 wrote , by eagle - eyed @entity27 resident @entity37 , who then decided to buy the shirt for a laugh			0
what they meant : written inside the state of @entity15 were the state initials ' @entity13 , ' for @entity13 after @entity33 ’s post and subsequent story in the @entity34 , which were followed by a flurry of reports of the embarrassing mistake on websites and social media across the web , @entity3 responded			1
‘ a small quantity of incorrect @entity8 tee shirts were recently made available for sale , ’ wrote a spokesperson @entity51			0
‘ this product should not have been sold			0
we have removed it from sale and apologize for the error			0
’ how many shirts , exactly , were sold and how many were made at all remains unclear			0
as @entity33 notes , @entity37 now likely has a collector 's item on his hands , one worth well over the $ 32 he paid			0
home team : though the panther team name is meant to be for both @entity13 and @entity15 , the team plays home games at @entity26 stadium in @entity27 , @entity13			1
@entity3 has pulled the shirt and apologized			0

inside an *outline* of @entity15 are the initials ' @entity13 '
