the @entity6 military had provided @entity23 with vast shipments of weapons and food supplies in recent months , according to the @entity53			1
with the @entity1 having now seized control of @entity23 - held buildings and territory , these supplies are now in the hands of @entity2 - backed terrorists , who used social media to goad the @entity6 military			1
' thanks be to @entity62 , @entity61 let the @entity63 take these weapons after we fought the traitors [ @entity23 ] , ' a @entity1 - linked @entity60 account boasted			2
' tens of @entity6 @entity12 missiles became for the @entity63 , ' the message added , alongside pictures of militants pointing at the stamped boxes that prove the products are @entity6 - made			2

sources within and close to @entity85 said that @entity86 , which enjoys good relations with the group , is encouraging the terrorists to go ahead with the move , which would boost the militants ' funding			2
the exercise could transform @entity85 from a weakened militia group into a force capable of taking on @entity32 at a time when it is under pressure from bombing raids and advances by @entity102 and @entity33 military forces			0

extremists : @entity1 militants ( pictured ) announced they are considering splitting with @entity2 in order to create an antonymous terror organisation that can rival the @entity32 's reign of terror in @entity3 and @entity33 intelligence officials from @entity83 including @entity86 have already met @entity1 's leader @entity122 several times in a effort to encourage him to abandon @entity2 , sources say			1
they promised funding once it happens			0

the @entity86 - led bid to rebrand @entity85 and to provide it with new support could further complicate the war in @entity3 as the @entity6 prepares to arm and train non-jihadist rebels to fight @entity32			1
