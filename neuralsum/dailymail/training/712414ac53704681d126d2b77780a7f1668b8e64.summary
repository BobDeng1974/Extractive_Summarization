by @entity0 to look at @entity2 taking her children to the park , you would think she was the picture of a healthy young mother			1
but the truth is that every step she takes causes her agony through her pelvis , bottom and legs			1
' it 's hard to explain to people just how much pain i am in , ' says @entity2 , 26			1
she has had a fractured pelvis for more than three years			1
but this did n't happen because of a car accident - it occurred during childbirth			1
@entity2 from @entity23 , @entity24 with her sons @entity26 , 3 , and @entity27 , 2 @entity2 's problems started when she was five months pregnant with her first child @entity26 , now three			1
she began getting a stabbing pain in her pelvic area and reported it to her midwife			2
' she told me all first - time mums - to - be got twinges and that it was normal , ' says @entity2 , a full - time mother from @entity38 , @entity24			1
but as her pregnancy progressed , the pain worsened and was sometimes so bad she could n't get out of bed			1
six months into her pregnancy , she went to her gp who explained that , as the body prepared for labour , the ligaments loosened so the pelvis could ' open up ' for birth - this could lead to a condition called pelvic arthropathy , or pelvic girdle pain , a common problem affecting one in five pregnant women			1
she was told the pain would vanish after childbirth			1
painkillers were not an option because of the potential harm to her unborn child			0
' my mum had to ask for a wheelchair for hospital appointments as i was in too much pain to walk			2
my partner had to lift me on and off the bed			0
it was hell , ' she says			0
after the birth of her first child @entity2 saw her gp four times , only to be told her pain levels were ' normal ' by the time @entity2 went into labour , the pain was acute			1
' i explained i had severe pelvic pain and would have trouble pushing			2
i could n't even climb on to the delivery bed			2
but the midwives made me feel as if i was a silly girl , ' she says			0
despite her pleas , @entity2 was told to push			1
' i had gas and air , but the agony was unbearable			2
every time i bore down , i felt as if my pelvis would snap			2
' after an hour of pushing , a doctor recommended a forceps delivery			0
after two attempts , @entity26 was born			0
but he had breathing problems and was taken to the special care baby unit			0
after two days , he was allowed home - but @entity2 , still in severe pain , was in hospital for a week			1
just holding @entity26 was agony			2
over the next three months she saw her gp four times , only to be told her pain levels were ' normal after childbirth ' and she did n't need treatment			1
@entity2 was referred to a physiotherapist , who taught her pelvic floor exercises and gave her a belt to support her back , but nothing helped			1
then when @entity26 was eight months old , @entity2 discovered she was pregnant again			1
' instead of feeling elated , i was terrified - not of labour pains , but because of my pelvis , ' she says			1
' this time the pain was even worse			2
' after @entity2 gave birth to her second son , @entity109 , she regularly went to her gp			1
' i knew there was something very wrong and that my pelvis was damaged in some way , but no one would listen			2
i lost count of how many times i asked for help , ' she says			0
finally , when @entity109 was six weeks old , she changed doctors and was sent for an x-ray			0
this revealed she had a fractured pelvis - and that the fracture was two - and - a - half years old - the same age as her first - born @entity26			1
the doctors could tell how old the fracture was from the way the bones had set			0
i 'd been walking around on a fractured pelvis for more than two years			1
why had it taken so long for someone to believe me ? ' @entity2 believes her pelvis was becoming more damaged during pregnancy and that the rough delivery caused the final fracture			1
she has since seen a specialist surgeon who has said that if she had been referred to him immediately after birth , he could have helped her by putting pins in her pelvis , but now there is nothing that can be done			2
her pelvis has set in the way it was when the fracture took place , leaving her in constant pain			1
' i go to the chronic pain clinic for painkillers , which i take every day and some days i have to use crutches , ' she says			2
she 's also suffered a prolapsed womb as a result of lack of pelvic support , and is on antidepressants			2
' i 've been told i will be in pain for life , that nothing can be done			2
i ca n't walk some days			2
i ca n't play with my children			2
some days i ca n't even get them dressed			2
' i believe that if i 'd been listened to at the start this could have been avoided			0
' a woman knows her own body and can tell when it is not ' one of those things ' , says @entity162 , an obstetrician and gynaecologist at @entity165 's and the @entity166			0
and while fractures such as that @entity2 suffered are rare - as well as pain there would usually be warning signs such as needing crutches - if a woman does experience severe pelvic pain , she should be assessed and considered for a caesarean delivery			1
' sometimes , because a woman is pregnant , things get fobbed off and not given the right importance , ' says mr @entity162			0
' the trouble is we do n't do x-rays in pregnancy because of dangers to the foetus , so often the real cause can be missed			2
' @entity2 takes painkillers every day and some days she has to use crutches			1
she 's also suffered a prolapsed womb when @entity186 , then six months pregnant , suddenly experienced searing pain in her hips while running for a train , she assumed , like many women do , that it was ' normal ' in pregnancy			1
@entity186 , then 26 , was working as a nurse - ' i knew ligaments softened in preparation for childbirth , so i thought i 'd just pulled a ligament , ' she says			1
but within three weeks she could barely walk			0
her gp put her on bed rest			0
the pain worsened and a week later she was admitted to hospital ; she needed a walking frame just to go to the bathroom			0
doctors kept telling @entity186 all would be well once the baby was born			0
' they kept trying to discharge me , but i kept refusing			0
i was a trained nurse and knew something was very wrong			0
the pain in my hips was agony , ' she says			1
she remained in hospital and five days before her due date , she was induced			0
she was given an epidural , but after the delivery - which was rushed , leaving her baby , @entity216 , with a broken collarbone - it wore off and the pain hit @entity186 like a brick wall			1
' it was much , much worse than before the birth , ' she says			0
' but the doctors told me to " concentrate more on my baby and less on myself "			0
the general feeling was that i was an over-anxious first - time mum and that pain was par for the course after childbirth			1
' fractures such as that @entity2 suffered are rare but if a woman does experience severe pelvic pain , she should be assessed a day after the birth , a consultant sent @entity186 for an x-ray , which revealed a fractured hip			1
at first she was told it might be bone cancer			0
numb with shock , @entity186 began writing a will and talking to her family about her funeral wishes			0
eight days later a consultant told her she did n't have cancer			0
six weeks after @entity216 's birth , @entity186 was diagnosed with pregnancy - associated osteoporosis			0
this condition , when the bones weaken , is rare and usually occurs only in a first pregnancy			0
it is thought some women may need extra vitamin d and calcium			0
@entity186 was kept in hospital for three months , had pins placed in her hips and was told the fracture would knit together			0
but this did not happen and it was the start of a long and arduous ordeal , leaving her with arthritis and one leg much shorter than the other because her femur had become misshapen through walking on it			0
' i was told i had the bones of an 84 - year - old , ' she says			0
at last , in 2012 - 24 years after her fracture - @entity186 , now 51 , had a hip replacement and can now stand for longer			0
like @entity2 , @entity186 believes doctors are too eager to fob off pregnant and post-natal women when they complain of serious ligament or bone pain			1
she believes that if she had been listened to during her pregnancy , though her fracture might still have happened , she would not have had to endure so much trauma and distress			0
' i 've met so many women who had fractured their hips or spine , but were not listened to because the professionals believed pain was normal during and after birth			1

every step @entity2 , 26 , from @entity24 , takes causes agony
mother - of - two suffered a fractured pelvis during childbirth
@entity294 said pain levels were ' normal after childbirth ' and did n't need treatment
