by @entity0 published : 09:30 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 10:45 est , 28 may 2013 @entity1 , founder of the @entity2 and one of the women behind the # @entity6 campaign a social media campaign calling on @entity8 to crack down on content endorsing violence against women is already seeing companies pull their ads from the networking site			1
@entity8 has refused to censor offensive content of the type identified by the group # @entity6 , that includes insulting pictures and slogans , as well as entire pages and @entity8 groups created to promote violence against women			1
examples of anti-women content on the site include ' @entity28 ' and ' @entity29 in the @entity31 ' groups as well as images of sleeping young women with their trousers pulled down alongside text suggesting they have ingested and enjoyed ' roofie ' date rape drugs			1
@entity8 cites its ' free speech ' or humour policies in defence and is so far refusing to remove some of the content according to the @entity6 group			1
they confirm they are in communication with @entity8 and hope for a positive solution			2
the campaign is calling on advertisers like @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 to pull their adverts until @entity8 bans such material , and brings its policies on content endorsing violence against women in line with racism and homophobia policies			1
@entity1 , founder of the @entity2 , writer and activist @entity64 and @entity65 from @entity66 ( @entity66 ! ) joined forces to launch the hashtag @entity6 campaign # @entity68 last tuesday			1
' specifically , we call on you , @entity8 , to take three actions , ' they wrote in an open letter			0
' recognize speech that trivializes or glorifies violence against girls and women as hate speech and make a commitment that you will not tolerate this content			2
' effectively train moderators to recognize and remove gender - based hate speech			0
' effectively train moderators to understand how online harassment differently affects women and men , in part due to the real - world pandemic of violence against women			0
' the group said more than 50,000 tweets and more than 4,500 emails had been sent through its site since the hashtag was launched last tuesday			1
a petition on @entity100 has also attracted more than 222,000 signatures			0
@entity1 , 26 , who lives in @entity102 , founded the @entity2 which has collected over 30,000 women 's experiences of gender imbalance over the last year alone			1
' i see and hear stories every single day from women whose lives are directly impacted by sexism , misogyny and sexual abuse , ' she tells the @entity113			1
' so these pictures and pages hit very close to home for me			0
and when i receive emails from teenage girls who have been raped , but wo n't report it because they think they must be to blame , or they wo n't be taken seriously , i ca n't help but think that @entity8 has a responsibility to stand up to the normalisation of rape and domestic violence that is created by these pages condoning and depicting it			1
# @entity68 posted this image on their website , drawing attention to advertisements next to the image ' of course it 's not as simple as saying that one directly leads to another , but it certainly creates a culture in which the message is sent out , loud and clear , that rape and domestic violence are something to laugh and boast about , not something to take seriously			1
' meanwhile , remember , @entity8 censors images of women breastfeeding or artistic representations of female bodies ... this is n't a case of ' free speech ' , because it already chooses so much material to ban as ' offensive ' , yet these images of women battered , bloodied and bruised are considered acceptable ... you have to question the double standard			1
' # @entity6 report that @entity154 @entity153 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and many others have already joined and backed the campaign by removing their ads until @entity8 pulls such offensive content			1
impressively , nearly 100 international women ’s and human rights organizations , from @entity166 ’s @entity165 to @entity168 ’s @entity167 , have signed and supported their open letter			0
a spokesman for @entity8 told the @entity113 that the pages referenced in the open letter have been removed from @entity8 as they broke their terms			1
they added : ' you have to seek out this content on @entity8			2
' it is viewed and interacted with by a tiny group of people on @entity8 who choose to do so			2
' offensive content exists all over the web - but generally there is no mechanism to report content that goes beyond offensive and becomes hate speech			2
on @entity8 every group , page or photo can be reported			2
@entity155 and @entity154 @entity153 have pulled ads until @entity8 bans material endorsing violence against women ' @entity8 's policy is that removing all offensive content or controversial humour from its site is not the solution to combatting ignorance			1
having the freedom to debate serious issues like this is how we fight prejudice			0
@entity8 looks to give people the freedom to describe , depict and comment on the world in which we live			0
' they added : ' when evaluating speech on @entity8 , we analyse the nature of the speech itself , as well as its perceived intent as indicated by any additional context we may have			0
' we believe this additional information is important , since identical words may be hateful in one context , or off - colour attempts at humour in another ( such as with stand - up comedy )			0
' if content satisfies our definition of harm , we will remove it immediately			0
' however , we allow people to use language and images , even when extremely offensive or inaccurate , to make jokes or express political beliefs that fall short of harm			0
' in an official statement in response to # @entity6 , a spokesperson for @entity8 said : ' there is no place on @entity8 for hate speech or content that is threatening , or incites violence , and we will not tolerate material deemed to be genuinely or directly harmful			1
we try to react quickly to remove reported language or images that violate our terms and we try to make it very easy for people to report questionable content using links located throughout the site			0
' however , as you may expect in any diverse community of more than a billion people , we occasionally see people post distasteful or disturbing content , or make crude attempts at humour			0
while it may be vulgar and offensive , distasteful content on its own does not violate our policies			0
we do require that any such page be clearly marked - so users are aware that the content may be in poor taste			0
in many instances , we may also require a page administrator to display their real name on the page , or the page will be removed			0
' in response to @entity8 's comments , @entity1 has said : ' while @entity8 may be removing some individual pages , a great deal of this content still remains , as evidenced by the fresh content we have been posting to our campaign site over the past few days			1
' what is needed is for @entity8 to change its policy on representations of rape and domestic violence not sporadically take down pages in response to media pressure while their policies mean such content could be reposted in the future			2
