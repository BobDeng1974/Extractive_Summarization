by @entity0 published : 10:44 est , 28 september 2013 updated : 06:20 est , 29 september 2013 former @entity2 footballer and @entity4 player @entity1 says attitudes towards black footballers in @entity7 are so full of prejudice that he will have to move abroad to fulfill his ambition of becoming a coach or manager			1
@entity1 , who won 73 caps as a defender for @entity4 and two @entity2 titles when he played for @entity15 , said he is likely to pursue his new career across @entity17 because of the ' archaic attitudes ' in the domestic game			1
the 39 - year - old , who retired in may 2012 following a 19 - year footballing career to take a coaching course , said : ' there are no opportunities for me here , not until attitudes change anyway			1
attitude : @entity1 said the way black managers were viewed in the @entity7 game was ' archaic ' he told the @entity30 : ' i want to start abroad			1
' everyone has to ask themselves why there are not more black managers in this country and why the likes of @entity37 have to go abroad ( to @entity38 in @entity39 ) to get a chance			2
' i 've spoken to other black players who want to coach and they feel the same , that attitudes here are archaic			0
' i hope and pray the environment changes			0
' there are only four black managers throughout the @entity48 game : @entity50 's @entity49 , @entity52 's @entity51 , @entity53 of @entity54 and @entity56 's @entity55			1
leading lights ? @entity49 and @entity51 both show true promise as managers @entity1 had hoped his first steps into coaching could come within the @entity4 setup , but he says their approach soon ' went cold '			2
he believes their attitude could be summed up by the fact that they went on to appoint the equally inexperienced @entity69 , who was also a regular in the @entity4 defence in which @entity1 so heavily featured , as assistant manager			0
' i gave my heart and soul for the national team but the @entity76 were not there for me when i had problems , ' he said			0
' it 's obvious they want nice people who wo n't cause them any problems			0
i put out an olive branch and it got broken , but whatever , i 'm ready to move on			0
' @entity4 assistant : @entity69 is already an established member of the international setup international team - mates : @entity1 ( third right , back row ) and @entity69 ( second left , front row ) played in the same @entity4 team for years			2

@entity1 is taking three - year coaching course following retirement in 2012
former @entity15 defender said there are ' no opportunities ' for him in the @entity7
there are currently only four black managers across the @entity48 game
