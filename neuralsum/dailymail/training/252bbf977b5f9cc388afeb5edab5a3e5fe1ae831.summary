@entity1 mayor @entity0 has called on anti-police protesters to stand down until after the funeral for two slain @entity5 officers , but his plea has fallen on deaf ears			1
civil rights activists led by @entity9 were quick to dismiss @entity0 's request issued monday and vowed to carry on protests stemming from the decisions of two separate grand juries not to indict police officers responsible for the killings of @entity16 in @entity17 and @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity1			1
. ' it 's a time for everyone to put aside political debates , put aside protests , put aside all of the things we will talk about in due time , ’ @entity0 said in a speech to a charity with close ties to the @entity30			2
their deaths heightened tensions that had been coursing for months between @entity46 , the police department and the reform - minded protesters who voted for @entity0 in large numbers			1
even @entity0 's assurance on monday that he would attend the slain officers ' funerals , normally an unquestioned mayoral duty , took on a political charge			1
earlier this month , the city 's largest police union said the mayor had abandoned the police and urged members to sign a letter insisting that the mayor stay away from their funeral should they be killed while on duty			2
police identified the killer as @entity85 , who wrote online that he planned to avenge the deaths of @entity18 and @entity16 , who were both unarmed black men killed by white officers			0
@entity85 killed himself with a shot to the head soon after			0
‘ let 's comfort these families , let 's see them through these funerals , ’ de @entity0 said in his speech , hours after visiting the officers ' grieving families with @entity94 , the police commissioner			1
‘ then debate can begin again			0
’ but @entity9 said @entity0 's call was too vague to heed			1
not listening : @entity9 said @entity0 's request to suspend protests was too ill - defined an activist group denounced the mayor 's plea as an ‘ outrageous ’ attempt to ‘ chill ’ free expression			1
pictured here is a man holding a protest sign during a demonstration against police violcence in @entity113 monday sending a message : activists stage a die - in at @entity113 two days after the officers ' killings protesters plan to continue their activities , despite claims from the @entity30 that the officers ' killer was inspired by the anti-police movement ‘ is a vigil a protest ? is a rally ? ’ @entity9 said in a telephone interview , calling @entity0 's comments ‘ an ill - defined request			1
’ @entity9 , who joined @entity18 's relatives over the weekend to denounce the slaying of the officers , said he would not change planned prayer vigils at the scene of @entity18 's death and elsewhere over the coming days to mark the family 's first @entity137 without him			1
the @entity139 , an activist group , denounced the mayor 's plea as an ‘ outrageous ’ attempt to ‘ chill ’ free expression			1
it said it had no intention of cancelling a long - planned protest march on tuesday evening			0
at least one small candle - light vigil called for by a separate coalition of groups took place in @entity5 on monday evening , an organizer said			0
@entity152 's remarks came two days after his tense relationship with the city 's police unions and rank - and - file officers hit its lowest ebb when two union leaders said the mayor had ' blood on his hands ' for the officers ' deaths			1
the @entity164 and the @entity166 's @entity165 have accused @entity0 , a @entity167 who ran for office on a platform of police reform , of helping incite a loathing of police through public remarks noting that he understood some of the protesters ' grievances			2
allies : @entity152 and @entity9 , pictured here in october at the civil rights leaders ' 60th birthday party , have enjoyed a close working relationship even if protesters say they will not be quieted , the heads of the city 's police unions had agreed to suspend any lobbying efforts tied to the protests until after both officers are buried , @entity94 said			1
rank - and - file officers have taken to social media sites and message boards to express their frustration with the mayor			0
on sites like @entity196 and @entity197 , officers wrote anonymous posts calling on @entity0 to stay away from the slain cops ' funerals			2
' a little too little			0
a little too late , ' wrote user @entity201			0
' i am wondering if he feels that it is worth a confrontation showing up to a funeral no one wants him at			0
' another user by the moniker otjkid ranted at the mayor : ' back peddling too late			0
all of sudden you support us with 400 million dollars for what ? cameras lol			0
@entity94 you kissing this guys a * * * is disgusting			0
' investigators said a video on @entity85 's cell phone showed him filming a protest against excessive police force at @entity1 's @entity222			0
rejecting the unions ' arguments , @entity0 said the attack should not be tied to the recent protests , which in @entity1 have been largely peaceful			0
but some protesters said the mayor sent the opposite message by using @entity85 's actions as a reason to temporarily stop protests			0
@entity152 has been on shaky ground with the police department since before he assumed office last january			2
during the mayoral campaign , the populist @entity167 spoke out against the @entity238 administration 's controversial stop - and - frisk policy , accusing police of disproportionately targeting young black men for random searches			2
@entity152 also has strong ties to @entity9 , who has organized numerous rallies protesting against mistreatment of inner city black men at the hands of police officers			2
@entity250 wrote that during the campaign last year , @entity0 's aides were convinced that members of his security detail made up of police officers were listening in on his private conversations inside his city - assigned car			1
according to an unnamed former staffer of the mayor 's , @entity0 would leave the vehicle to make sure the officers were not eavesdropping on him			1

*reverend* @entity9 responded to @entity0 's request by saying it was too vague
the @entity139 denounced the mayor 's plea as an ' outrageous ' attempt to ' chill ' free expression
a ' die - in ' protesting police violence was held at @entity113 two days after murders of officers @entity41 and @entity40
the murders heightened tensions that had been simmering for months between @entity46 , the police department
@entity281 aide said during campaign the *future* mayor was sure cops on his security detail were eavesdropping on his conversations
