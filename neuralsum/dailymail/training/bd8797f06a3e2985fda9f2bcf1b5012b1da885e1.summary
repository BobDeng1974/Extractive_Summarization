scientists have created a new type of ice that could help geologists better understand the planet ’s inner workings , as well as combat climate change			1
named @entity8 , it is the least dense of all known forms of ice and has a delicate cage - like structure that can trap gaseous molecules			1
these molecules can be anything from methane to carbon dioxide , and are contained in ‘ clathrate ’ cages deep beneath the sea floor			2
researchers have unveiled a new solid phase of ice that ’s the lowest density known			2
the cage - like structure originally formed surrounding neon atoms ( blue )			0
the neon was removed ( red lines ) to uncover its composition by uncovering the intricate structure of these clathrates , scientists hope they can use it for carbon capture and storage , by removing methane from the sea floor and replacing it with @entity36			1
scientists at @entity38 in @entity39 and the @entity40 in @entity41 suspected that the structure of an empty clathrate may look like , but up until now it was hypothetical			1
this is because clathrates are wrapped around other atoms in a configuration too fragile to be untangled			0
to separate the delicate clathrate cage from its guest molecules , scientists used vacuum pump , coupled with very low temperatures			0
to separate the clathrate cage from its guest molecules , scientists used vacuum pump , coupled with very low temperatures			0
this image shows the reactor at the @entity40 where the research was conducted they used neon atoms as the guest molecules , which , when exposed to the vacuum , were slowly drawn away without damaging the cage			0
@entity65 , also called gas hydrates were discovered in 1810 by sir @entity66			0
they crystalline solids which look like ice , and which occur when water molecules form a cage - like structure around smaller ' guest molecules '			0
the most common guest molecules are methane , ethane , propane , isobutane , normal butane , nitrogen , carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide			0
in the 1930s , these tiny ice cages turned out to be a major problem , clogging pipelines during transportation of gas under cold conditions			2
by uncovering the intricate structure of these clathrates , scientists hope they can use it for carbon capture and storage , by removing methane from the sea floor and replacing it with @entity36			1
what was left was @entity97 , which researchers hope to use to explore the intricate structure of a clathrate hydrate			0
@entity102 , one of the study authors and instrument scientist on @entity105 at the @entity40 , said : ' it is important to note that clathrates could also be formed with carbon dioxide gas which would create stable compounds on the ocean floor			2
‘ this means there is a possibility we could extract methane and convert it to useful energy , and replace it with the @entity36			1
‘ in other words , we could pump co2 down to the ocean floor as a replacement for the methane in the gas hydrates			2
‘ the challenges involved would naturally be large and the feasibility has been called into question , but it remains an extremely intriguing possibility worth exploring as well as its use in carbon capture and storage , the new ice may help when it comes to pumping natural gas , which often comes with clathrates			1
such research could help ease the flow of gas and oil through pipelines in low temperature environments , and open up untapped reservoirs of natural gas on the ocean floor .			1

the new type of ice was created by scientists from @entity41 and @entity39
they hope to use the @entity8 to extract methane from beneath the ocean
methane can then be converted used as energy , with the *bi-product* of @entity36 being pumped back *underground* and stored outside of the *atmosphere*
@entity157 may also help ease the flow of natural gas through pipelines
