@entity1 boss @entity0 is relishing his side 's return to the role of @entity6 outsiders after watching them keep their @entity8 hopes alive with a gutsy goalless draw against @entity10 at @entity11			1
the @entity13 ' recent knockout heroics had made them narrow favourites to book their place in the semi-finals for the first time since 1911 despite the face they faced higher league opposition			2
but after watching @entity21 come closest in a clattering clash when he hit the woodwork late in the first half , @entity0 was keen to revive the siege mentality which helped them to wins over @entity28 and @entity29			1
@entity0 is congratulated by @entity30 as @entity1 shocked @entity28 at @entity31 parkinson the manager collides with @entity33 of @entity10 during the @entity6 quarter final match @entity0 said : ' we will go down there for the replay really as the underdogs and we will approach it in a positive fashion because we 're at our best when we do that			1
' we won at @entity31 which was seen as a day out for us because no - one expected us to go and get a result			0
so we are still very much alive and kicking			0
' the draw will mean a rare return for @entity0 to the club for whom he made 361 appearances and as a player and was voted their best ever central midfielder in an online poll			1
@entity53 heads the ball wide of the @entity10 goal during the @entity6 quarter final match at @entity11 ' i 'm looking forward to going back there because i have n't got down there many times since i left , ' added @entity0			1
' obviously i would have preferred to have gone through but the next best scenario is the replay			0
' @entity63 and @entity64 also hit the post for @entity10 who were bidding to make their own bit of history by reaching the last four for the first time since 1927			0
and @entity71 's men know they will probably never have a better chance than their replay against @entity75 opposition which is scheduled for a week on monday at the @entity76			0
@entity63 heads the ball onto the post during the @entity6 quarter final match @entity71 had plainly set his side up to combat the physical nature of the @entity13 who had stunned @entity29 in the fifth round and taken the lead inside the first four minutes			2
and the tone for a full - throttle but low - quality encounter was set in a robust opening minute as @entity89 barged over @entity90 and moments later @entity92 's challenge left @entity94 stretched out on the deck			0
the bruising encounter continued in the same vein from the first whistle to the last with @entity10 captain @entity99 playing the last three minutes with a broken nose after an accidental clash with @entity1 substitute @entity102			2
@entity103 applauds the fans following their team 's 0 - 0 draw during match between @entity1 and @entity10 @entity1 had stepped up the pace in the second half with chances for @entity94 and @entity53 but it was @entity10 who came closest to snatching it when @entity64 's late free - kick caused a mighty scramble in the home box			1
@entity71 said he hoped the replay would attract a sell - out crowd at the @entity76 but rejected his side 's role as favourites and stressed the @entity13 were still very much in the hunt for a semi-final place			1
@entity89 strikes the ball as @entity125 of @entity10 closes in during the @entity6 quarter final match ' we are both still in the hat and can look forward to the draw , and both teams will fancy their chances in the replay , ' said @entity71			2
' we hit the post twice and on another day we could have nicked it but it 's probably a fair result and now we will look forward to them coming back to our place			0
' i knew we were in the game from the first minute from the way we were challenging and getting the second balls			0
i knew we were determined to get them back to our place if that was the best we could do , and everyone was 100 per cent concentrated on that			0
' @entity145 of @entity1 reacts after seeing a goalscoring chance missed during the @entity6 quarter final			1
