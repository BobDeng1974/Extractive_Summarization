by @entity0 published : 16:24 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 03:44 est , 20 march 2013 plans to redefine marriage in @entity4 could mean that @entity5 could perform ceremonies , a church has claimed			1
the @entity7 has described plans by the @entity9 to create a third category of marriage as ' completely nonsensical ' ahead of a consultation on the proposals later this week			1
reiterating its opposition to gay marriage , the @entity7 said today that the proposals to establish ' belief ' ceremonies alongside religious and civil ones could raise the prospect of @entity22 officiating marriage			1
may the force be with you : @entity22 fanatics in @entity26 are pictured learning @entity22 moves at a special class			2
the @entity7 has claimed that new government marriage proposals could see @entity5 performing marriage ceremonies but the government defended its plans saying that the reputation of @entity4 marriage would be protected and that the move would help groups such as humanists who are classed as a religious entity			1
a spokesman for the @entity7 said : ' the proposal to create a third category of belief marriage ceremony alongside the current religious and civil ones is an indication of the increasing confusion that we can expect in the coming months and years			0
' humanists are already able to perform marriages under the religious category and we see no reason why this should not continue			0
' instead we are faced with the @entity9 seeking to create a new category for something which already happens under the current system , which is completely nonsensical			1
' we would also question whether this category only includes humanists or will it allow for any belief ? ' could the @entity5 or members of the @entity59 be registered as belief celebrants ? devout fans : some 14,000 people cited their religion as @entity64 in the 2011 census , taking their inspiration from the @entity22 films , including @entity68 ( pictured ) ' we believe that once the legislation is passed , the issues and complications will not go away			1
' the @entity9 said however , that it would protect marriage by ensuring that a religious or belief body would have to meet a number of tests before a ceremony can take place			0
a @entity9 spokesman said : ' our current consultation covers not only the introduction of same - sex marriage but also the detail of important protections in relation to religious bodies and celebrants , freedom of speech and education			0
' as part of the consultation , we have outlined the reason for suggesting a third type of ceremony			0
' at the moment , marriage ceremonies by bodies such as humanists have been classed as religious , even though the beliefs are non-religious			0
' it also makes clear that we are determined to ensure the continued reputation of @entity4 marriage ceremonies			2
we are proposing the introduction of tests which a religious or belief body would have to meet before they could be authorised to solemnise marriage			0
' the @entity7 is a @entity106 and @entity107 denomination			0
it currently has over 100 congregations in @entity4 , as well as two in @entity110 , five in @entity111 , and sister churches founded by mission work in @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			2
in the @entity117 , around 14,000 @entity4 named their religion as @entity64 , inspired by characters from the fictional @entity22 films			1
@entity22 values have often found themselves adopted as modern philospohical path or religion , with movements such as the controversial @entity125 spawned			1
a knights school in @entity26 @entity127 also offers classes in @entity22 skills .			2

the church described proposals as ' completely nonsensical '
