former prime minister @entity0 , giving a speech today , admitted his military intervention in @entity3 and @entity4 has made the @entity5 less inclined to tackle radical @entity6 @entity0 today warned @entity7 will pay a ' heavy price ' for failing to intervene in @entity9			1
the former prime minister again defended his decision to invade @entity3 and warned of the ' consequences of non-intervention '			2
but he admitted that his military interventions in @entity3 and @entity4 had made the @entity5 less inclined to tackle radical islam			1
he urged a deal with @entity17 in @entity9 and suggested the @entity5 must work with @entity19 president @entity18 to tackle ‘ radicalised and politicised view of @entity6 ’ despite increased tensions over @entity22			1
mr @entity0 told @entity23 : ' i totally understand the reasons why people did n't want to intervene in @entity9			1
' personally i would have had us intervene - not full - scale troops on the ground or anything of that nature - but a couple of years ago , i think we could have created a situation in which an optimistic solution for the country was possible			2
' i think now we 're faced with a situation where it 's a choice of two very bad options - no one wants to see @entity17 stay , people are rightly , i think , now very anxious about elements within the opposition with extremists and so on - and this is , in my view , going to cause us problems for many , many years to come			2
' having been through @entity3 , @entity4 and so on , i know what the difficult consequences are of intervention			2
but if you look at @entity9 , you see the consequences of non-intervention , and i think non-intervention there is , i think , something for which we will pay a very heavy price			1
' in a major speech in central @entity59 , mr @entity0 listed nations where he says there is an ‘ essential battle ’ to be fought against radical @entity6 , including @entity3 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity9 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity4			1
‘ there is no engagement that does n’t involve putting yourself out there			2
there is no commitment that does n’t mean taking a risk , ’ he added			2
sources said it was ‘ far too blunt ’ to suggest he was advocating ‘ only military engagement ’ , saying he would back the revolution in @entity64 which overthrew the @entity80 government as the ‘ necessary rescue ’ of the country			1
mr @entity0 attacked the ‘ absurdity ’ of @entity7 and its allies spending billions on security and defence to protect themselves against the consequences of the extremism ‘ advocated in the school systems and institutions of the very countries with whom we have intimate security and defence relationships ’			1
mr @entity0 , who is still dogged by his controversial decision to take @entity7 to war in @entity3 and @entity4 , insists the @entity5 should have bombed @entity9 last year despite opposition led by his successor @entity101			1
he used today ’s major speech in the @entity103 to acknowledge that ‘ recent conflicts ’ had taken away many governments ’ appetite to engage in the @entity106 , but he will assert that the case is stronger now than at any time			1
@entity7 and the rest of the world must ' take sides ' in confronting a ' deadly ' mixture of religion and politics across the @entity106 , mr @entity0 said no backing down : rather than shy away from the invasion mr @entity0 has continued to defend it prominently @entity0 must not be allowed to delay the release of the @entity122 report into the @entity123 , a former @entity119 attorney general warned today			1
@entity124 called for ‘ urgent clarification ’ on whether mr @entity0 , ex-pm @entity126 or the @entity127 are to blame for the delay in publication			2
the former law officer in mr @entity0 ’s first @entity127 urged @entity131 to make a ‘ firm decision ’ to release the report well ahead of next year ’s general election			2
@entity124 , who spent two decades on the @entity119 frontbench , warned there is ‘ now the real danger is that the publication will run into the 2015 election ’			0
writing in the @entity139 , he urged mr @entity131 to commit to publication as soon as possible			0
‘ who is responsible for the delay ? @entity122 and his colleagues , who must be anxious to publish , ’ @entity124 said			0
‘ two past @entity145 - @entity126 and @entity0 ? a cabinet office fighting to maintain a precedent that cabinet minutes and discussions between the two previous prime ministers should be permanently kept private ? ‘ @entity151 deserves a clear statement from mr @entity131 as to the reasons for the delays			0
’ his remarks are the closest he has come to an expression of regret over the impact of his military decisions			2
he said : ‘ at the root of the crisis lies a radicalised and politicised view of @entity6 , an ideology that distorts and warps @entity6 ’s true message			1
‘ the threat of this radical @entity6 is not abating			1
it is spreading across the world			0
‘ it is destabilising communities and even nations			0
it is undermining the possibility of peaceful coexistence in an era of globalisation			0
and in the face of this threat we seem curiously reluctant to acknowledge it and powerless to counter it effectively			0
’ mr @entity0 suggested an @entity182 ideology that mixes politics and religion in ‘ such a deadly way ’ must be confronted			0
the @entity7 and other countries should examine ‘ how we should be building alliances to achieve this , including the recognition that on this issue , whatever our other differences , we should be prepared to reach out and co-operate with the @entity192 , and in particular , @entity19 and @entity193 ’			0
apart from being a ‘ global energy supplier ’ , the @entity106 is significant because it is ‘ on @entity196 ’s doorstep ’ , he added			0
insisting that the future of @entity6 ’s relationship with politics will be determined in the region , he added : ‘ this is controversial because the world of politics is uncomfortable talking about religion			1
but i assert it nonetheless			0
‘ he said the @entity5 must back the ‘ principles of religious freedom and open , rule - based economies ’			1
mr @entity0 branded the turmoil in @entity9 ' an unmitigated disaster ' , calling for a settlement with president @entity17 - whom he has previously condemned			1
' we are now in a position where both @entity17 staying and the opposition taking over seem bad options , ' he said			0
' the former is responsible for creating this situation			0
but the truth is that there are so many fissures and problems around elements within the opposition that people are rightly wary now of any solution that is an outright victory for either side			0
' repugnant though it may seem , the only way forward is to conclude the best agreement possible even if it means in the interim president @entity17 stays for a period			0
' should even this not be acceptable to him , we should consider active measures to help the opposition and force him to the negotiating table , including no - fly zones whilst making it clear that the extremist groups should receive no support from any of the surrounding nations			0
