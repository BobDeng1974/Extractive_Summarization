when he was just three weeks old , @entity2 the @entity1 lion cub met @entity3			0
@entity2 ’s mother had rejected him in favour of his siblings and zoo keepers quickly decided it was n’t safe for him to stay			0
so they called @entity3 from @entity10 in @entity11			1
‘ we named him @entity2 , which is @entity16 for blue , because he had these unusual electric blue eyes when he arrived , ’ ms @entity3 told @entity13			0
nine months later , and weighing close to 80 kilograms , @entity2 still shares @entity3 ’s bed most nights			0
he still carries his teddy bear around with him and he loves to suck on people ’s thumbs			0
‘ this morning he just would n’t get out of bed , he ’s a total sook , ’ she said			0
the retreat – which is not yet open to the public – is home to lions , tigers , monkeys , dingoes , parrots , rescued farm and domestic animals from all over @entity59			1
' many of the animals already lived on the property and i 've cared for them for years ’ , says @entity63 , who has worked in animal rescue and as a zoo keeper in @entity59 and overseas for more than 20 years , as well as training big cats for film and television			1
she says zoos will often have surplus animals from their breeding programs or they might have too many males for an enclosure , who then start to fight like they would in the wild			2
some of the animals at @entity77 also starred in the movie industry in the days before computer imaging and special effects			1
there are only two circuses in @entity59 – the @entity83 and @entity84 - that still use monkeys and lions in their tents			1
@entity3 says the laws around circus animals in @entity59 are especially tough			2
' they 're very well loved and cared - for animals and when we talk to them , they just want the best for their animals , for them to be spoilt when they retire , ' she says			2
‘ we ’ll be given a lot of older animals , which is good because we can give them a good life here - it 's literally like a retirement home for exotic animals			1
‘ we ’re the first and only exotic animal retreat in @entity59			1
' just one of the pride : @entity2 and director @entity31 share a moment at the retreat @entity59 supermodel @entity109 celebrated her 31st birthday this year with one of the pride at @entity10 @entity59 model @entity113 also took time out from her international modelling career recently to hang out with the cubs at @entity77 @entity10 ( @entity10 ) is an entirely volunteer run non-profit organisation , set up by @entity3 and fellow directors @entity118 and @entity119 when they took over management of the property in 2012			1
though not yet open to the public , over 20 students are currently completing work placements at @entity77 as part of their @entity126 in @entity127 at @entity128 and universities			1
the organisation is in the process of applying for an exhibition license so that they can open the retreat for public visits and offer master classes in large carnivores for students in the future			2
‘ there are some things i ca n’t teach , ’ says @entity63 , who has been hospitalized more than a few times working with the big cats in the early years of her career			0
‘ it ’s a feeling you get from the animals , you have to be able to read their signs – but that ’s something you can only learn from experience , ' she says			0
‘ what i can teach is how to look after these kind of animals the way they need to be looked after ; i can offer practical placements where students can get the real experience , get close to the animals , observe them and really learn from them			0
’ one of @entity2 's favourite things to do is suck on people 's thumbs			0
people can now support @entity10 by ' adopting ' an animal like @entity2 or his best friend @entity170 , another adopted cub @entity10 's @entity3 with @entity2 , the orphaned nine - month - old @entity1 lion @entity3 hopes to eventually be able to open the retreat for public visits and to offer master classes in large carnivores for students at nine - months old , @entity2 is already five times the strength and body weight of a person @entity181 , who was born and hand - raised at the @entity10 @entity3 has worked in animal rescue and as a zoo keeper in @entity59 and overseas for more than 20 years , as well as training big cats for the movie industry			1
@entity3 is pictured with @entity186 , who came to @entity10 from a zoo at just three months old @entity10 is the only home for old and retired exotic animals in @entity59 @entity190 and executive assistant , @entity191 , with some of the dingoes rescued by the @entity11 retreat special bond : @entity191 helped raise @entity77 , a ' friendly ' lioness who was born at the @entity11 wildlife retreat @entity10 is also home to exotic birds like peacocks and native @entity59 wildlife the retreat also provides a rescue service for abused or neglected farm animals like horses , goats , donkeys and pigs the retreat is expecting its electricity bills to go through the roof as it provides extra heating for some of its more delicate residents coming into winter the centre is also looking to expand its facilities to include a native wildlife rehabilitation centre which it hopes will support the work of wires ( @entity59 's @entity221 ) and attract international students for practical animal care placements in the future			1
‘ but all of this costs big bucks , ’ @entity63 says ‘ all the money we receive is from donations and it all goes into the care of the animals			2
ideally i want to rebuild all the animal enclosures but one new lion enclosure will cost us $ 70,000			0
’ for now , the public can support the retreat by adopting one of the animals in the @entity77 pride like @entity2 or by becoming a paid member of the retreat			1
@entity2 and his best friend @entity170 , another nine - month - old lion , will soon join older sisters @entity77 and @entity245 in one of the facility 's larger enclosures			2
but for now , while he 's still happy to share a bed with his human mum , @entity3 says he ’ll be allowed to continue sleeping in the big house			0
people can find out more about adopting an animal and supporting the retreat through the organisation 's website www.zambiwildliferetreat.com.au			0
up close and personal : @entity2 plants a big one on @entity10 director @entity31			2

the @entity10 is the only facility for retired exotic animals from zoos and the movie industry in @entity59
the @entity11 retreat is home to lions , tigers , monkeys and dingoes as well as rescued farm and domestic animals
the retreat is hoping to raise money to expand its facilities so it can accept more animals and open a training centre
although not yet open to the public , you can now ' adopt ' one of the @entity77 pride to support the non-profit facility
