schools should enlist men to help stem the ' epidemic ' rise in eating disorders among girls , according to a child health expert			1
dr @entity7 believes men are an ' untapped army ' in the fight against body dissatisfaction who could offer a different perspective on the issue			1
he argues that contrary to popular views , men tended to have a ' much kinder take ' on female body fat , eating and sex appeal than many women			1
and instead of regarding men as ' the cause of the problem ' , they should be allowed to counteract the view that ' female body fat is unattractive and disliked by males '			1
male pupils should be encouraged to tell their female counterparts that curves ( which @entity30 is famous for ) and body fat are attractive , a child health expert has said dr @entity7 , a specialist who advises schools , will address a closed gathering of @entity37 teachers as part of a @entity40 @entity40 professional development programme			1
he will tell them that men are crucial to addressing the problem in schools			2
he will say : ' addressing this problem must extend beyond the ' learn to love your body ' and ' media literacy ' lessons in the classroom to include more input from the men in a girl 's life			2
' men are an untapped army who need to become aggressively vocal about the culture and messages bearing down on their daughters , partners , sisters and female friends			2
' men have a very different and much kinder take on female body fat , sex appeal , eating and weight loss			1
' knowing what men think can actually serve as an antidote to the prevailing assumptions that feed body dissatisfaction			0
' last year , the @entity75 ( @entity75 ) found hospitals were dealing with a rising number of eating disorder cases , with the biggest rise among youngsters aged ten to 19			0
dr @entity7 believes men are crucial in the fight against negative body image and should be used to counteract the view that ‘ female body fat is unattractive and disliked by males ’ body image is already routinely tackled in schools as part of personal , social , health and economic ( @entity37 ) classes			1
dr @entity7 argues men are sometimes slow to become involved in this delicate subject because they were traditionally seen as the cause of the problem			2
he will say : ' today men are in a position to countercheck the prevailing highly damaging generalisation that female body fat is unattractive and disliked by males			1
' this is not replacing one prescriptive view of the ideal female form with another			0
' whether we consider it politically incorrect or not , how men - meaning in this case fathers , brothers , grandfathers and partners - see women 's bodies is a real part of life			0
' dr @entity7 , the author of @entity116 , has compiled researching suggesting men do not find body fat or the ' pear shape ' aversive			1
according to him , fathers can play an especially important role in preventing and helping their daughters to overcome body image pressures			0
he will say : ' men are often surprised to discover how even the most intelligent , capable , rational and empowered women can be laid low by body dissatisfaction			0
many of us just do n't get it			0
' when made aware , men can be protective and aggressive if they believe their daughters or partners are being made unhappy in this way			0
it 's time we harness this different perspective and ensure it 's put to good use			0
' dr @entity7 , a chartered biologist and chartered psychologist , worked on health education campaigns with the @entity140			2
