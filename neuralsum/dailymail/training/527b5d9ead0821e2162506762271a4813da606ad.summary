this is the abandoned wasteland which was once a cutting edge ski - slope used to train the stars of @entity2 for the @entity3			2
the @entity4 was once the beloved training venue for @entity6 , 21 , @entity7 , 23 , and @entity8 , 18 - half of @entity2 's @entity9 ( @entity10 )			1
but since april 2012 it has suffered several fires - some of which were arson - and @entity16 has condemned it as ' a hot spot for vandalism and fly - tipping '			0
now all that remains as a reminder of the sites former glory are a few signs , some dry ski slope bristles and the odd abandoned ski			1
the owner of the 16.5 acre site has now applied to build 70 houses on it			1
but @entity31 , head coach of @entity2 's @entity10 team , said the athletes ' success was due to the ski village			1
he said : ' @entity4 had to be one of the @entity38 's standout slopes for me			0
it was the first place that really invested in a full freestyle arena and the first dry slope in the @entity38 to have a half pipe			0
' to succeed in alpine skiing , you have to have a lot of money behind you			0
but with freestyle skiing , no way			0
from a hillside in @entity4 came the extreme skiing of the @entity51			0
beneath it , rotting vegetation and debris scatter the entrance now all that remains as a reminder of the sites former glory are a few signs , some dry ski slope bristles and the odd abandoned ski half of @entity2 's freestyle skiers at the @entity89 , which is taking place in @entity91 , @entity92 , learned their tricks at @entity4			1
now it has gone , there is a question mark over where @entity98 's next generation of @entity99 will come from the slope was opened in 1988 when the city council donated a patch of land on a disused quarry next to a tip. this evolved into the ski village , a collection of spiky plastic ski slopes overlooking the city @entity4 was once the go - to slope for aspiring winter athletes			2
but soon the trend for dry ski slopes was taken over by modern indoor snow domes skiers and snowboarders at the slope , in its heyday , before arson attacks and modern training techniques saw it rendered little more than a rubbish tip a thing of its time , @entity4 was the first place that really invested in a full freestyle arena and the first dry slope in the @entity38 to have a half pipe but since it fell into disrepair the owner of the 16.5 acre site has now applied to build 70 houses on it - to the dismay of the stars who honed their sport on the slopes the once beloved site has been strewn with rubbish and apparently become a dumping ground for flytippers			1
it now seems there is little chance of it being returned to its former glory as one of the most beloved slopes to today 's @entity99 an abandoned ski lodge at the disused site - surrounded by mountains of rubbish @entity8 started skiing aged six and was taken to the @entity4 every saturday by her dad who saw the white slopes while working at the top of a tower block in @entity4 overgrown moguls on the slope are almost completely unrecognisable after weeds and brambles have reclaimed the site mr @entity31 added : ' to succeed in alpine skiing , you have to have a lot of money behind you			1
but with freestyle skiing , no way			0
from a hillside in @entity4 came the extreme skiing of the @entity51 ' amid the rubbish and mud , small glimpses of greenery can be seen creeping through the gaps @entity91 2014 olympian @entity6 was last season 's number one for slope style freeski and won silver at the 2013 @entity178			2
he said his life would have been very different if it had not been for @entity4 it seems that since the arson attacks , some of the slope ski lodges have been used for less than sporting purposes @entity16 has condemned it as ' a hot spot for vandalism and fly - tipping ' after a number of arson attacks since 2012 @entity38 's @entity6 performs a jump during the men 's freestyle skiing slopestyle qualification round at the @entity89			2
he is said to have spent many summer holidays at the @entity4 slopes			0

@entity4 was once the beloved training venue for half of @entity2 's @entity9 ( @entity10 )
now all that remains as a reminder of the sites former glory are signs , and the odd abandoned ski
owner of 16.5 acre site has applied to build 70 houses on it . but @entity2 say their success is in part down to slope
