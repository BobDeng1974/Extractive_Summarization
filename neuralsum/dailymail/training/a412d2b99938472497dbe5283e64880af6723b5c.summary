@entity0 raised eyebrows at the @entity2 last week when he wore a medallion symbolizing the @entity4			1
the @entity6 - born rapper was sitting court - side at a @entity9 game on tuesday with wife @entity10 when he was snapped wearing the controversial symbol			1
one of the core tenants of the @entity4 - an off - shoot of the @entity14 - is that white people are ' wicked and inferior ' to black men			1
fashion choice : rapper @entity0 turned heads at the @entity9 game on tuesday when he wore a @entity4 medallion race game : the @entity4 is an offshoot of the @entity14 and one of the core tenants is that white people are ' weak ' and ' inferior ' to black men who hold the power of @entity27			1
on the left , a zoomed in view of @entity0 's medallion compared to the group 's official symbol on the right when asked by a reporter whether the medallion is meaningful to him , @entity0 shrugged and said ' a little bit '			1
this is n't the first time that the rapper has been connected to the @entity4			0
he was photographed wearing another similar medallion while giving radio interviews for his album @entity42 last summer			1
and in ' @entity44 ' a track on that album , @entity0 references the five - @entity4 acronym for @entity47 by rapping ' arm leg leg arm head '			1
the @entity4 was founded in 1963 by @entity49 , a former student of @entity50 but @entity49 decided to split off from the @entity14 after disagreeing over the idea of @entity27			1
early days : the @entity4 was founded in 1963 as an offshoot of the @entity14 by @entity49 of @entity53 the @entity4 was founded by @entity53 , @entity54 native @entity49 in 1963			2
@entity49 was originally a student of @entity50 , leader of the @entity14 , but split from the movement because he did n't agree with their definition of @entity27			2
followers of the @entity14 believe that founder @entity59 is @entity27 , but @entity49 does n't agree since he believes that @entity27 can only be ' purely black ' and @entity59 was bi-racial			1
@entity49 , who changed his name to @entity47 , also believe that @entity27 was n't a supernatural being , but something found in all black men			1
black women did not possess @entity27 , according to his beliefs , but were subordinates of black men			1
still they hold a higher position that all white people who are considered ' weak , wicked and inferior ' according to @entity70 , who was written two books on the group			1
the @entity4 get their name from the idea that only five per cent of humanity known the truth about existence and are ' poor righteous teachers ' trying to tell the rest of the world the truth another 10 per cent also know the truth but propagate a belief in a ' mystery @entity27 ' to the ignorant 85 per cent			0
@entity49 died in 1969 after being murdered in his @entity53 housing project			0
the @entity4 continue today with many followers in the rap world			0
@entity87 , the @entity88 and @entity89 of @entity90 are all noted adherents			0
@entity49 did n't believe that @entity27 was a supernatural being , but rather something found in every black man ( black women do not have @entity27 in them and are considered subordinates , but still hold a higher standing than white people )			1
which means he disagreed with the @entity14 's belief that founder @entity59 was @entity27 since @entity59 was bi-racial and not ' purely black '			2
' the rationale is that the black man is @entity27 and created the universe , and is physically stronger and intellectually stronger and more righteous naturally , ' author @entity70 told the @entity104			0
' whiteness is weak and wicked and inferior — basically just an errant child who needs to be corrected			0
' @entity70 , a white converted @entity108 , has written two books on the the five - @entity4 and told vice : ' the first lesson i learned from the @entity4 was simple			0
f * * * white people			0
white people are devils '			0
@entity49 was a former student of @entity50 , but disagreed with the @entity14 leader over the idea of @entity27 above , a @entity4 center in @entity53 , @entity54			2
several prominent rappers have become adherents of the movement including @entity87 and the @entity88 while @entity4 do n't refer to themselves as @entity108 , they borrow their name from the @entity14 's idea that five per cent of humanity are ' poor righteous teachers ' who are trying to teach the world the truth of existence			2
another 10 per cent know the truth of existence but keep the 85 per cent majority in ignorance by preaching belief in a ' mystery god '			0
@entity0 is n't the only rapper that has taken up the @entity4 cause			2
@entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 of @entity90 are all noted followers			0
but a representative for the group 's upstate region told the @entity104 that they are not happy with @entity0 flaunting their symbol			0
' @entity0 is not an active member — no one has vouched for him ” said @entity47			2
' it was always understood that you do n’t wear the @entity146 if you do n’t totally subscribe to the life			0

the @entity6 - born rapper wore a medallion representing the @entity4 at a @entity9 game last week
one of the main tenets of the @entity14 offshoot is that white people are ' weak and wicked ' and that black men hold the power of @entity27
when asked if the medallion holds any *importance* to him , @entity0 said : ' a little bit '
@entity0 was *spotted* wearing the nation 's symbol last year while giving radio interviews for his new album , @entity42
a representative for the @entity4 said @entity0 is not an active member and should n't be wearing *regalia* unless he subscribes to their beliefs
