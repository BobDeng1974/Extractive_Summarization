gay marriage is one of several threats to the traditional family unit that undermines ' the future of humanity itself ' , pope @entity0 warned yesterday			1
the pontiff told diplomats from nearly 180 countries that the education of proper of children needed proper ' settings ' and that ' pride of place goes to the family , based on the marriage of a man and a woman			2
' the @entity0 made his comments , some of his strongest yet against gay marriage , during a new year address to the diplomatic corps accredited to the @entity25			1
new year address : pope @entity0 , pictured arriving for an audience with the diplomatic corps at the @entity25 yesterday , where he warned gay marriage is one of several threats to the traditional family unit during his speech , he touched on some economic and social issues facing the world today , including gay marriage			1
he said : ' this is not a simple social convention , but rather the fundamental cell of every society			2
' consequently , policies which undermine the family threaten human dignity and the future of humanity itself			0
the family unit is fundamental for the educational process and for the development both of individuals and states			0
' hence there is a need for policies which promote the family and aid social cohesion and dialogue			0
' the @entity25 and @entity57 officials around the world have protested against moves to legalise gay marriage in @entity61 and other developed parts of the world			1
one leading opponent of gay marriage in the @entity65 is @entity67 archbishop @entity66 , who the @entity0 will elevate to cardinal next month			1
@entity66 fought against gay marriage before it became legal in @entity69 last june , and in september he sent a letter to president @entity71 criticising his administration 's decision not to support a federal ban on gay marriage			0
in that letter @entity66 , who holds the powerful post of president of the @entity65 @entity77 , said such a policy could ' precipitate a national conflict between church and state of enormous proportions '			0
the @entity84 , which has some 1.3billion members worldwide , teaches that while homosexual tendencies are not sinful , homosexual acts are , and that children should grow up in a traditional family with a mother and a father			0
gay marriage is legal in a number of @entity61 countries , including @entity95 and the @entity96			0
some churches that have allowed gay marriage , women priests , gay clergy and gay bishops have been losing members to @entity57 , and the @entity25 has taken steps to facilitate their conversion			1
in 2009 , @entity0 decreed that @entity104 who leave their church , many because they feel it has become too liberal , can find a home in @entity57 in a parallel hierarchy that allows them to keep some of their traditions			2
the @entity25 has since set up " ordinariates , " structures similar to dioceses , in @entity119 and the @entity65 to oversee ex-anglicans who have converted and be a point of contact for those wishing to do so .			2
