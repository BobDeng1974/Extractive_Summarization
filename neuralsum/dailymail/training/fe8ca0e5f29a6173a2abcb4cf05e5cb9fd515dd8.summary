the three @entity1 jet crew lost in a crash in the @entity3 this week were named for the first time today as defence secretary @entity5 today paid tribute to the pilots			2
mr @entity5 said flight lieutenant @entity8 had been killed , and squadron leader @entity9 and flight lieutenant @entity10 were still missing presumed dead			1
' my thoughts - and , i am sure , those of the entire @entity13 - are with their loved ones at this difficult time , and with the fourth member of the squadron involved in the incident , who is currently in a serious but stable condition in hospital , ' he told @entity22			1
the fatal mid-air crash off the north - east coast of @entity26 between the two @entity27 may have been caused by fog , it was claimed earlier this week			1
flight lieutenant @entity8 , left , was killed in the @entity27 warplane crash while squadron leader @entity9 , right , is missing presumed dead flight lieutenant @entity10 is also missing presumed dead after the @entity1 crash in the @entity3 north - east coast of @entity26 in ' thick fog ' the two planes – each carrying a pilot and navigator – were not flying together but somehow collided at high speed in bad weather			1
the pilots would not have spotted each other on their radar because it covers the ground and not the surrounding airspace			2
this raises the possibility they simply flew into each other in fog thick enough to hamper the rescue operation			1
grieving : a family lays flowers at @entity52 airbase following the announcement that two airman are presumed dead and one confirmed dead following the collision between war planes one line of inquiry will be whether either crew asked ground radar stations if other aircraft were nearby			1
families of military personnel at @entity52 say their loved ones were overworked and exhausted because of cutbacks			1
@entity27 sources say these claims are ' wrong and appalling '			2
crash investigators will also explore the possibilities of mechanical failure , a bird strike and human error			0
recovery : a member of the rescue team on a lifeboat with some of the plane wreckage after it was salvaged wreckage : a @entity82 lifeboat carries parts of a crashed @entity1 back to shore after two of the aircraft collided in mid-air over north - eastern @entity26 and independent experts from the @entity89 will look at the experience levels of the airmen at the controls of the planes			1
the jets plunged into the @entity3 about 25 miles south of @entity95 on tuesday after completing a practice bombing raid on a @entity98 firing range			0
two of the four airmen were plucked from the water and airlifted to hospital			1
it is understood they had tried to eject from their stricken warplane before it hit the water			0
one was pronounced dead but the other is in intensive care at @entity112			2
the search for the two missing airmen was terminated last night by the @entity115 , ending any hope of finding them alive			1
tragedy : more wreckage from one of the crashed planes is carried from the lifeboat after it arrived back in @entity123 , a town close to where the incident happened			2
two airmen were rescued and two are still missing mangled : teams of volunteers pick through the wreckage gathered yesterday operation : one of the @entity132 which assisted with yesterday 's search and rescue mission group captain @entity134 , the @entity52 station commander , said the officer confirmed dead was from @entity136 , which trains pilots and weapon systems operators to fly the £ 40million @entity27			1
' two additional personnel remain unaccounted for			2
we must be realistic , ' he added			0
' given the length of time that has elapsed since the accident , there is no expectation of recovering missing personnel alive			1
' it is important that we establish the facts of what happened and it is vital that the investigation is allowed to take its course			0
' but the priority now is to ensure that the families of those involved receive the support they need at this most difficult of times			0
' crash : the two @entity27 planes crashed in the @entity3 off the @entity26 coast			1
it is understood they were on a training exercise and the crash happened in thick fog			1
it is not known if a technical fault is responsible speaking in the @entity13 , @entity168 paid tribute to the airmen			2
the prime minister said the incident was a reminder of the risks military personnel took in training as well as on operations			1
' it 's clearly a very serious incident , ' he added			0
last night a relative of a serviceman at @entity52 said : ' the reason that these crashes are happening is because everybody is undermanned , the engineers are overworked			1
' the planes are too old			2
they can no longer fix them properly			0
' it 's having a massive impact [ on safety ] because when they 're flying , they 're knackered			1
' there 's so much going round in their heads when they 're flying now that it 's very , very difficult to concentrate on flying			2
somebody really high in the @entity27 is not saying to the government , “ we ca n't do that ”			0
' the claims were vehemently rejected by military sources			2
base : the pair rescued were based at @entity52 , pictured , and have been taken to hospital in @entity206 a @entity98 spokesman said : ' a full investigation into this incident will carried out by the @entity89 , which will be an independent investigation looking at all the possibilities of what might have happened			1
' wreckage from the planes has been found and the fuselages are likely to be salvaged this weekend			2
the @entity27 were understood to be on a low - flying exercise at the time of the accident			1
military sources said that the two jets had collided during the exercise but investigators will also look at whether either plane suffered a technical malfunction or accidentally ditched into the sea			1
the fact that two crewmen had been recovered with dinghys and parachutes indicated they had managed to bail out of the doomed aircraft before it struck the water			0
first minister @entity231 said : ' this is clearly a very serious incident and my thoughts are with the loved ones of those affected			0
' i understand rescue services have done all they can to help with the situation and offer my thanks to all those involved			0
