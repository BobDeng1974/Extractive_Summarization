@entity2 's dr @entity1 will be released from mandatory quarantine this week after being exposed to @entity4 - but the network may drop the chief medical editor , reports claim			1
@entity1 , a surgeon who spent 17 years reporting for @entity7 before joining @entity2 in 2006 , came under fire for allegedly violating her quarantine and then refusing to explain what happened			1
the confusion sparked a furious response from thousands of viewers writing to the station to say they no longer trust @entity1			1
the network would not comment			0
@entity1 was ordered into mandatory quarantine until wednesday october 22 with the rest of her broadcast team after she allegedly violated their voluntary isolation			1
the team covered the @entity4 outbreak in @entity36 and worked briefly with @entity37 , the cameraman who caught the virus and is now being treated in @entity39			1
upon returning to the @entity40 , @entity1 and her crew agreed to quarantine themselves for 21 days , the longest known incubation period for the disease			2
they have shown no symptoms			0
yet @entity48 health officials ruled that her quarantine should be mandatory after @entity1 and her crew were spotted getting takeout food from a @entity48 restaurant			1
@entity2 wo n't give details about who actually went into the restaurant , or even how many of its employees are being quarantined			2
@entity1 issued a statement saying ' members of our group ' violated their pledge			2
quarantined : @entity1 has been in mandatory quarantine after covering the @entity4 outbreak in @entity65 suffering : cameraman @entity37 contracted the disease while working with the team			1
he is being treated more than 1,100 people have subsequently written on @entity1 's @entity70 page , many expressing anger			2
there were suggestions she should be fired or lose her medical license , and some viewers said they would n't trust her again			2
@entity1 's failure to be more specific about the lapse or take greater responsibility was another flashpoint			2
@entity1 's ' arrogance and dismissiveness ' create a huge pr and credibility problem for @entity2 , said @entity84 , an expert on ethics for the journalism think tank the @entity88			1
' people are so freaked out about @entity4 that the problem @entity2 has now is that whenever they put her on the air , some news consumers are going to see the woman who put others at risk , rather than the reporter and professional with great experience , ' @entity84 said			1
@entity84 suggested that @entity1 ' lay low ' or take a leave of absence			2
certainly she should not report on @entity4 anymore for the network , she said			0
future : @entity1 will have to discuss the future of her 25 - year career in journalism when she is released @entity103 , a longtime health journalist and commentator for @entity105 and the @entity107 ' @entity106 , ' said people should n't forget that @entity1 put herself at risk to travel to @entity36 and cover the story			0
the public is reacting to a fear of @entity4 instead of science , she said			0
' she and her team clearly should have observed the terms of their quarantine , and she has said clearly that they made a mistake , ' @entity103 said			0
' but let 's put it in a broader perspective			0
' before @entity1 's trip for takeout , @entity7 ' medical expert arguably had bigger problems			1
@entity7 health editor dr. @entity127 was in @entity36 at the same time as @entity1 and did not quarantine himself upon his return			1
that led @entity7 president @entity130 to send his staff a memo explaining that the network was following medical advice			0
still , @entity127 was disinvited to a speaking engagement at @entity136 in @entity137 , he wrote last week in the @entity138			0
some colleagues have avoided him			0
' i 've been surprised by how many colleagues have waved from across the room and quickly made an exit , ' @entity127 wrote			0
' others wo n't enter my office			0
' @entity2 could face a competitive disadvantage if @entity1 is taken off medical stories			1
@entity148 , the network 's longtime health and science correspondent , left last year to teach at @entity152			0
an important first step for @entity1 will be to explain to viewers exactly what happened , perhaps on a venue like the ' today ' show , said @entity158 , a longtime @entity2 executive who now teaches journalism at @entity160			1
' if she and the network are more forthcoming about the whole matter , i believe that her credibility can be preserved , ' @entity158 said .			0

dr @entity1 sparked outrage after ' violating @entity4 quarantine '
thousands of viewers were enraged at her ' arrogant ' cryptic explanation
@entity2 team was in voluntary quarantine after working with @entity4 *patient*
but they were forced into mandatory isolation after ' she drove to a takeout '
@entity181 must decide if chief medical editor 's credibility remains intact
