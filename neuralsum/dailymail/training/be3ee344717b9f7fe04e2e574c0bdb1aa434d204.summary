she performed it in spectacular style at the @entity12 @entity11 earlier this month , watched by a record @entity12 tv audience of 114million , plus millions more globally			1
the latest figures suggest it could plummet down to 51 by tomorrow if current sales levels continue			1
it is one of the worst showings in almost three decades of chart hits for the singer in a career that has generated 13 @entity34 number ones			2
@entity6 ' was her first new track for three years - and a first release under a new three - album deal she signed with music giant @entity40			1
here 's @entity8 ! the megastar is first seen pushing a pram from a supernatural looking surburban home in the video normal service resumed : it 's not long before @entity8 is back down to her hotpants , and surrounding by football players - fittingly although @entity8 's previous single revolver fared worse in 2009 , reaching only number 130 , it had already been available on a greatest hits album celebration for three months prior to its release			2
the 53 - year - old 's single prior to that , also entitled @entity55 , went to number three in 2009			0

some fans thought the chart position had been affected by this and would recover this week , but sales have been ever fewer			0
it is the first time the lead track from one of her albums has not gone into the top ten since her debut single in 1982			0
and most new songs have made it into the top three			0
tickets for @entity8 's @entity79 show this summer - part of an international tour - went on sale last friday and have still to sell out .			0
