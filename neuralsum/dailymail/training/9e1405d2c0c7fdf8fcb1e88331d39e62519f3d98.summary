teachers allowed two young sisters to get so badly sunburned that they needed hospital treatment because of a little - known law that bans students from applying sunscreen at school			1
fair - skinned @entity7 , 11 , and her nine - year - old sister @entity8 were left seared from head to toe after spending an afternoon in the sun during an outdoor field day in @entity13			1
their mother , @entity16 , who did n't put cream on the girls in the morning because of a rain forecast , was horrified to learn that teachers refused to allow the children to apply any cream			1
yet the girls say they were forced to watch one teacher put on her own sunscreen and then explain to the burning students that it was ' just for her ' when they begged her for some			1
' while i can sort of wrap my brain around this in theory , the practice of a blanket policy which clearly allows for students to be put in harm ’s way is deeply flawed , ' mrs @entity7 wrote in a blog post			2
making matters worse , the mother claims that one of her daughters has a form of @entity61 - a skin condition that leads to easy burning - that her school was aware of			2
prescription : @entity67 , like this product shown , is considered an over-the - counter medication and not allowed in most schools across the country without a prescription ' @entity7 is starting to blister on her face			1
both children have headaches , chills and pain , ' mrs @entity7 wrote last wednesday after taking the children to @entity78			0
' two are home today as a direct result of how terrible they feel			0
my children indicated that several adults commented on their burns at school , including staff and other parents			0
' for liability reasons , most states consider sunscreen as an over-the - counter medication requiring a prescription			1
' because so many additives in lotions and sunscreens cause an allergic reaction in some children , we have to really monitor that , ' said @entity101 , a @entity102 spokesman speaking to @entity103			0
since raising awareness in her area of the @entity107 policy , mrs @entity7 began to see some success late last week			0
receiving a call from the director of @entity112 in @entity102 last thursday according to her blog , the director informed her of a new law passed allowing districts to decide for themselves what 's allowed and what 's not			2
' he stated that how the law will actually shake - out for districts is still to be seen ( the devil is always in the details ) , but that he hoped a policy revision could be achieved by october , ' the mother wrote			0
asked by the @entity124 on friday the condition of the two girls , the mother replied : ‘ they will heal this week , but long term effects are yet to be seen			2

@entity133 , 11 , and sister @entity8 , nine , seared from head to toe
state rules mean sunscreen is treated as prescription medicine and banned
yet teacher using own cream would n't let girls use it , adding : ' it 's just for me '
@entity149 did n't apply sunscreen herself because of rain *weather* forecast
