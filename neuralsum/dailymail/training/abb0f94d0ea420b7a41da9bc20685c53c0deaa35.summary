when @entity1 played in front of thousands of fans at @entity4 for the @entity5 , he may well have felt strangely at home			1
for the chart - topping singer has revealed that , as a teenager struggling to make his mark in the music industry , he slept rough under an arch next to the @entity4			1
now 23 – and despite becoming one of @entity14 ’s leading stars with an estimated fortune in excess of £ 7million and with his latest album x topping the charts on both sides of the @entity20 – the memory of being homeless has left an indelible legacy in one of his songs			0
‘ that ’s where i wrote the song homeless and the lines “ it ’s not a homeless night for me , i ’m just home less than i ’d like to be			0
” ’ @entity1 described his unorthodox living arrangements in a new book called a @entity45 , which charts his rise to the top			1
the star was 16 when he moved from @entity49 to @entity50 in 2007 to study at music college			0
but when the course ended , he no longer had a grant to pay for the rent and had to carve out a living performing gigs and selling cds from a rucksack			0
he spent the next two and a half years sleeping on @entity60 trains or ‘ sofa surfing ’ in friends ’ homes			1
he said : ‘ i did n’t have anywhere to live for much of 2008 and the whole of 2009 and 2010 , but somehow i made it work			0
‘ i knew where i could get a bed at a certain time of night and i knew who i could call at any time to get a floor to sleep on			1
’ @entity1 , who has written hits for @entity75 and @entity29 , said he found his nomadic existence enjoyable but admitted there were some ‘ hairy ’ periods			1
‘ i spent a week catching up on sleep on @entity81 trains , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’d go out and play a gig , wait until 5am when the @entity60 opened , sleep on the @entity81 until 12 , go to a session – and then repeat			1
it was n’t that bad			0
‘ it ’s not like i was sleeping rough on the cold streets			2
’ as a struggling performer , @entity1 has admitted he slept on the street outside @entity4 the singer released his debut album in 2011 , and by the following year was playing before the @entity92			1
and , while he does not give a precise location for the arch by the @entity4 and it is not clear when exactly he stayed there , he admits his alternative lifestyle did take one particular toll			1
‘ i did n’t have the best personal hygiene at that point because i did n’t get a chance to shower , ’ said @entity1 , who now has two brit awards and an @entity100			1
‘ it was just : sleep on the train , session , sweat on stage , drink , sleep on the train			2
i had 23 dreads on one side of my head from not washing my hair			0
my girlfriend counted them when she took them out with a comb			0
’ meanwhile , a fresh - faced @entity1 performed in concert at the @entity122 in @entity123 giving it his all : the a-team hitmaker put his heart and soul into his performance he also admits he would often be drunk on stage during his early gigs although he now says he never drinks before a performance			2
@entity1 ’s current lifestyle could n’t be further removed from his previous existence dossing in @entity50			2
home is a large farm he bought in 2012 close to where he grew up in @entity138 , @entity49			0
and last year he also splashed out on a £ 2 million ranch in @entity140 , close to the home of his former girlfriend , @entity143 singer @entity29			0
he has also been linked to pop star @entity144 and recently performed at a private house party where the guests included @entity147			0
