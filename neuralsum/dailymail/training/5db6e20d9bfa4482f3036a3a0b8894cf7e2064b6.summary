little - known jockey @entity0 was thrust into the spotlight on @entity2 at @entity3 as he produced a faultless ride to win the feature race on splash of @entity7			1
for the 20 - year - old from @entity8 the 9 - 2 favourite ’s three - and - a - quarter - length victory from @entity11 in the £ 50,000 @entity12 was certainly a tale of the unexpected			1
@entity0 , who is based with trainer @entity15 , had travelled to the track expecting to ride only @entity17 in an earlier race			2
splash of @entity7 , ridden by @entity0 , on the way to victory at @entity22 on thursday but when colleague @entity23 sustained a collarbone injury as @entity25 fell in the @entity26 ’ @entity27 won by @entity28 , @entity15 handed the responsibility of the mount on splash of @entity7 to @entity0 even though his career total of wins under rules was only five			1
@entity0 said : ‘ i had about a quarter - of - an - hour ’s notice			1
i had my suit on and was ready to leave			0
the @entity17 ride was good enough			0
he ran a blinder to finish fifth			0
’ @entity0 , who had ridden only nine point - to - point winners , joined @entity15 a little over a year ago after spending two years with @entity39			2
he added that , anticipating only one ride , he had not set his tv to record the big race but he was sure to have plenty of reminders last night in @entity45 , the @entity46 ’s local pub. it was there that splash of @entity7 ’s owner @entity49 and his ‘ @entity50 ’ , which yesterday numbered 50 , had toasted their talented gelding ’s win in last season ’s prestigious @entity54 and the plan was for a repeat			1
@entity15 said : ‘ it is only @entity0 ’s sixth winner but he is very good			0
it was a faultless display of jockeyship			0
@entity49 is so kind to the boys , he likes to give them all a chance			0
@entity23 stepped in when splash of @entity7 won the @entity54			2
@entity0 riding splash of @entity7 , clear the last to win the @entity27 at @entity3 ‘ the landlord of the @entity66 is probably ordering more beer as we speak			1
after the @entity54 it took them two - and - a - half days to leave there			0
’ splash of @entity7 was travelling well when he fell four out in the @entity72 , won by @entity73 , at @entity3 ’s december meeting			1
his owner ’s @entity76 roots will make @entity78 a target later this season but , before that , @entity15 intends returning the seven - year - old to the novice ranks with the @entity84 at the @entity85 being his target			1
lying in wait there will be the @entity89 - trained @entity28 , an impressive six - length winner of the @entity91 yesterday under @entity92			2
being a @entity95 winner over hurdles and good enough to run in last season ’s @entity97 , when he was sixth to @entity100 , the two - mile @entity93 might have seemed @entity28 ’s natural target but @entity89 is adamant he will get better as he goes up in trip			0
20 - year - old @entity0 celebrates his unexpected win on thursday to pocket a £ 50,000 jackpot yesterday ’s race , in which he beat @entity106 six lengths , was over two miles five furlongs , and @entity89 sees next season ’s three - mile @entity108 as a longer - term target			1
@entity89 also landed the @entity111 with @entity113 possible @entity112 , whose jockey @entity114 helped make it a big day for the young faces in the weighing room			0
the 17 - year - old son of @entity120 trainer @entity119 went on to complete a 285 - 1 double on his father ’s @entity122 in the @entity124			1
the two wins were his first at @entity3 and followed his first ever treble at @entity127 on @entity128			2
little wonder he is being tipped as a rider to follow			0
@entity89 said : ‘ horses seem to run for him			0
he will be very good			0
’ @entity0 clears the last on way to a three - and - a - quarter - length victory at @entity3 on @entity2			1

20 - year - old won the feature race at @entity3 on splash of @entity7
three - and - a - quarter - length victory had a jackpot of £ 50,000
