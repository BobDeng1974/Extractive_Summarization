migrants arriving from the @entity2 could be required to register with police as part of the immigration reforms announced yesterday by @entity6 , it has been reported			1
mr @entity6 hopes that the new packet of measures , which the @entity9 say they will implement if they regain power in the general election in may , will work to cut overall levels of immigration by making it harder to stay in @entity15 without a job			1
but critics were quick to point out that it would be difficult to monitor and deport any out - of - work migrants - arguing that they were unlikely to appear on official databases			1
setting out his plans yesterday , mr @entity6 said that unemployed @entity2 migrants will be banned from receiving state support , and would be deported if they do not get a job within six months of arriving			1
the prime minister believes it could dramatically reduce @entity15 's appeal to workers in central and eastern @entity42 , who are able to top - up their incomes with in - work benefits like tax credits			2
but questions were raised over how authorities would keep track of whether migrants gained employment , stating that it the proposed deportations would n't be possible without this information			1
the answer might be requiring immigrants to sign in with police on their arrival , an unnamed source has told the @entity28			1
the policy would mean that an individual could be monitored - and deported from the @entity15 if they were still unemployed after six months			1
for workers from the @entity2 : no in - work benefits until they have been in @entity15 for four years no social housing for four years no child benefit or tax credits paid for children living outside the @entity15 for unemployed @entity2 migrants : no support from the @entity15 taxpayer deportation if they do not get a job for six months other measures include : impose restrictions on @entity2 migrants bringing in family members from outside the @entity2 @entity78 bans on rough sleepers , beggars and fraudsters returning to the @entity15 tougher rules on deporting foriegn criminals refusing to allow other countries to join the @entity2 without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached @entity15 levels the source said : ' we are considering all options			1
and requiring migrants to sign in and register is one of the things we are looking at			2
' the practice is common in a number of other countries , and minister believe it would be straightforward to set up a similar scheme here			2
mr @entity6 has abandoned an attempt to impose a limit on the number of people who can come to @entity15 , despite latest figures showing a record rise in @entity2 immigration			2
aides concede the idea of a cap or an ' emergency brake ' if the number of migrants from individual countries suddenly soared , were too complex to implement			0
several senior @entity2 figures had warned it would be illegal and breach the fundamental right to free movement across the continent			0
today foreign secretary @entity121 denied that mr @entity6 ' backed off ' his plans in the face of pressure from @entity126 chancellor @entity125			2
mr @entity121 acknowledged that ministers had consulted with other @entity2 member states ahead of mr @entity6 's long - awaited speech			1
however , he rejected reports that the prime minister had dropped plans for a cap following the intervention of mrs @entity125 , who has made no secret of her opposition to any measures which undermine the principle of the free movement of labour within the @entity2			0
he said : ' i do n't think that is right			0
what is right is that we have sought to work with our partners in the @entity2 to understand the best way of delivering a reduction in immigration numbers from the @entity2 in to the @entity15			0
' instead , mr @entity6 has focused on a package of measures limiting access to benefits which is much more draconian than anything proposed to date by @entity154 or the @entity155			2
yesterday in a speech at a @entity158 factory in @entity159 , mr @entity6 announced the measures intended to make it more difficult to stay without a job			1
doubt : critics were quick to point out that it would be difficult to monitor and deport any out - of - work migrants - arguing that they were unlikely to appear on official databases			1
above , mr @entity6 speaking yesterday he said that , a new fund will also be promised in the @entity169 general election manifesto to help areas worst affected by dramatic influxes of immigrants			1
he believes it could dramatically reduce @entity15 's appeal to workers in central and eastern @entity42 , who are able to top - up their incomes with in - work benefits like tax credits			0
the prime minister demanded the new rules to apply to countries joining the @entity2 , ensuring their economies must reach a certain level before free movement of their citizens is allowed			0
the reform would be designed to eliminate the overwhelming economic pull for people to move from poor countries to richer ones			0
at least seven countries , including @entity193 , have suggested they want to join the @entity2			0
mr @entity6 made clear that without agreement on allowing the @entity15 to dramatically curtail the pull factors which make it so attractive to @entity2 migrants , he will ' rule nothing out ' â€“ raising the prospect of backing @entity15 's exit from the @entity2 if he does not get his way			1
the @entity169 leader has promised that if he is prime minister after the next election he will renegotiate @entity15 's membership of the @entity2 before holding an in - out referendum by 2017			0
he said : ' it is not wrong to express concern about the scale of people coming into the country			0
' people have understandably become frustrated			0
it boils down to one word : control			0
' while his proposed curbs on benefits will apply to existing @entity2 countries , he wants to go further for new member states			0
the @entity6 insisted that if his renegotiation of @entity2 membership is a success he will campaign to keep @entity15 in .			2

could be *introduced* as part of @entity6 's reforms , it was reported
