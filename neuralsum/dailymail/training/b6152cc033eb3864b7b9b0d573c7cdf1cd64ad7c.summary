by @entity0 @entity1 looked up at the giant , black - and - white image and scowled			1
it was of an older man , smart , distinguished , quite a dramatic portrait in its way			2
his suit is sharp , his white shirt crisp , his classic striped tie perfectly fixed			2
the lines on his face , his wedding ring , suggest experience and wisdom			2
his demeanour suggests business - like confidence , yet without noticeable aggression			2
video : scroll down for @entity1 : we 'll have to wait and see what @entity21 brings suits you : @entity1 fits the role of @entity27 manager after a long and distinguished career calm : one of his most impressive feats has been to create a harmonious training camp environment ‘ i hate that , ’ said @entity1 , glaring at his photograph			1
he sat down beneath it , a casual , unassuming figure in a grey t - shirt and tracksuit bottoms			2
this is @entity1 as he prefers to be seen			1
‘ the team that wins this @entity41 , ’ he said , ‘ will not necessarily do so because of managerial excellence			1
it will be because they have very good footballers and work together			0
it ’s players that count , at the end of the day			2
’ @entity1 is n’t quite as without ego as he would like the world to believe – no boss can be , by definition – but his discomfort over the heroic projection of his features is real			1
‘ it has been decided by the sponsors , ’ he said			0
‘ they want to animate everywhere we go			0
if you were to ask the question , “ would i like to see it removed ? ” the answer is “ absolutely ”			0
but unfortunately ... ’ – and he pivoted in his chair to stare helplessly again – ‘ ... there it is			0
’ @entity1 plays the modern game of branding and commerce and embarks on the standard rounds of media inquest but , deep down , there is an old - fashioned football man screaming to get out and coach			1
this is his second @entity41 and his first was 20 years ago in the @entity74 when as manager of @entity76 he negotiated a tricky group until an unsuccessful reckoning with @entity79 in the last 16			1
for a start , @entity1 was almost unknown in his own land			1
still got it : @entity1 strikes a ball with his right peg in training feeling the heat : the @entity27 manager watches on as his players rehydrate during a session a @entity92 - schooled coach but without professional pedigree as a player , he had left @entity27 at a young age for a manager and had barely returned			1
his success was abroad , in unfashionable @entity98 and then @entity76			1
when @entity27 failed to qualify for the 1994 tournament it created a bubble of domestic interest , further piqued when @entity1 was appointed coach of @entity104 , but it has ebbed and flowed since			1
@entity1 appeared destined to orbit @entity105 football , certainly its national team			1
and then came the appointment of the current club @entity27 management board – two accountants , one media man and sir @entity112 to do the football – and @entity1 ’s understated values were suddenly in vogue			1
they wanted an @entity105 manager , but with the cv of a foreign coach , and an aversion to controversy			0
the prophet was no longer without honour in his own country			0
clearly , there is vindication in @entity1 being here now			1
equally , it would be an act of utmost vanity to make the most eagerly anticipated @entity41 of the modern era all about him			1
on saturday he will name the most significant @entity130 since the match with @entity132 in @entity133			1
so @entity1 trod the sensible path			1
he acknowledged the journey on his way to this moment , without elevating its importance above the next game			2
‘ i certainly never thought i was a pioneer , but i ca n’t remember feeling resentful either , ’ he said			0
‘ i suppose because in the countries where i was working , particularly @entity98 and @entity76 and , then , to some extent @entity143 , i was getting more than enough attention , and even acclaim			1
' so i never thought , “ this should be done in @entity27			1
” i think i just accepted the fact that i left very young , totally unknown and i was just pleased to be able to fulfil an ambition to become a recognised and appreciated coach			0
' i ’m really happy to be with @entity27 now			1
it ’s part of my birthright as an @entity105 although i never thought much about destiny			0
’ throwback : @entity1 leads the @entity156 team in training at the @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity160 in june 1994 @entity161 : with @entity104 players ( from left ) @entity162 , @entity165 and @entity166 in 1999 @entity76 in 1994 were a very different proposition			1
@entity168 was expected of them – although the cowbells carried by their fans made the most noise in the tournament – and it would not have been hard for @entity1 to keep his adopted nation happy			1
just one look at the giant media facility at @entity27 ’s @entity178 training base shows that @entity27 expects , despite the managing of expectations			1
once here , it is impossible for @entity27 to play the shrinking violets and @entity1 knows it			1
this is a team built from players in one of the richest leagues in the world , household names some of them , and while there may be less chuckle - headed optimism than has infested previous campaigns , come saturday a defeat by @entity143 will not be viewed as par for any course			1
‘ i think i feel calmer , more in control than i did in 1994 , ’ @entity1 said			2
‘ it ’s always very difficult to analyse or describe yourself			0
you hope you ’ve evolved in some way and that in all the experiences over that time you ’re improving rather than deteriorating – not just as a coach but a human being			0
' the professional danger is that you lose some of your enthusiasm , your energy and vitality in those 20 years			0
i would like to think i have n’t and that i ’m a better manager now than then			0
' i ’ve had more help this time , certainly			0
i feel that our set - up , technically , physically , administration-wise , is much better than i had in 1994 – but i think every country would say that			2
’ not that @entity1 has reason to be anything other than grateful to the @entity156			2
his success there led to him being appointed manager of @entity104 , which gave him a second spell at the club as a caretaker in 1999			0
dictator : to stop @entity143 , @entity27 need to stop their midfield orchestrator @entity224 @entity225 'd : @entity224 dinking a penalty past @entity227 during the @entity229 quarter - final shootout it was there that he met the man @entity27 must nullify in @entity21 on saturday , @entity143 ’s playmaker @entity224			1
the @entity233 wrote in his autobiography that @entity1 mispronounced his name as @entity236 , which translates as dickhead , to general hilarity			2
in doing so , @entity224 said , ‘ perhaps @entity1 understood my true nature more than the other managers ’			2
‘ i ’ve heard this story , but i think he may have used a bit of poetic licence there , ’ @entity1 smiled			2
‘ i called him @entity224 , for the most part			0
' i do n’t ever remember referring to him as @entity224 – i ’m a @entity249 name person			0
maybe @entity224 and @entity250 sound similar			0
certainly he was anything other than a ‘ pirla ’			0
‘ i felt a bit sorry for him , actually			0
he had n’t played much because the squad was full of number tens , and that was how he was regarded at the time			0
there was @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 and a couple you wo n’t remember			0
‘ he was in a group all vying for the same position			0
he did n’t play that much but i thought he was very good in training , a wonderful talent , and @entity269 showed a stroke of genius when he went to @entity272			0
' @entity104 let him go , so they obviously did n’t fully believe in him , and @entity269 transformed him into a deep lying midfield player rather than a real number ten and that ’s when he started to blossom			0
’ it is at times like this that @entity1 becomes that man in the picture , the times when he can talk about some of the greatest names in the @entity284 game from personal experience			1
it has n’t all been @entity287 and @entity288			0
‘ do n’t read too much into that , ’ he said , with one final glance at the immaculate and dignified figure on the wall			0
yet @entity1 does not look out of place in this company ; just as he does not look out of place in that immaculate suit .			2

@entity1 believes it is the players who will make difference at @entity41
his second @entity41 after taking @entity76 to @entity74 ' 94
set to name @entity27 *'s* most important xi since playing @entity132 in 2010
