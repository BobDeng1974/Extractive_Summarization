by @entity0 published : 11:29 est , 17 january 2014 updated : 13:28 est , 17 january 2014 former first lady @entity2 has made another statement against her son @entity4 's possible 2016 presidential run saying that there have to be more politically - involved families in @entity7 hoping for time in the @entity8			1
' i think this is a great @entity7 country , a great country , and if we ca n't find more than two or three families to run for high office that 's silly because there are great governors and great eligible people to run , ' she said in a new interview			2
' i think the @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 - there are just more families than that			1
' twice is enough : @entity2 said that should her younger son @entity4 decide to run for president in 2016 , that would be pushing the amount of time that one family had been in the @entity8 the 88 - year - old matriarch has made the same statement previously , and she stuck to her beliefs in the latest interview with @entity35 but added a big compliment to her younger son			1
' i would hope that someone else would run although there 's no question in my mind that @entity4 is the best qualified person to run for president , ' she said			2
' but i hope he wo n't because i think he 'll get all of my enemies , all his brother 's , all ... and there are other families			0
i refuse to accept that this great country is n't raising other wonderful people			0
' she said that she was n't ' arrogant enough ' to think that she was part of the only family in @entity7 to raise children ready for the @entity8			2
waiting in the wings : @entity4 , the former governor of @entity54 , is seen as a leading @entity56 candidate for 2016 and could make him the next @entity56 leader after his brother left office ( seen at a 2004 rally for former president @entity61 's re-election ) political families : though they are both potential front runners for their respective parties , @entity63 and @entity61 appeared at the same event at the @entity67 in september the interview appeared to be filmed in her home as there were framed family pictures on the table beside her , including one of her granddaughter @entity75 at her wedding and two other pictures of subsets of the @entity61 family posed in front of @entity83 trees			1
she also gave several of her grandchildren shout outs in the interview , praising their different ways of helping the world without going into politics			0
' we 're raising public servants , whether they 're feeding the poor like @entity94 is - who 's fed 68 million children around the world - or @entity2 who 's bringing global health to the world or @entity101 who 's working for @entity103 , ' she said			0
' there are a lot of ways to serve and being president is not the only one			0
' skilled : mrs @entity2 , seen here with her husband and @entity4 in 2002 when he was running for re-election as the governor of @entity54 , said that she has no doubt that he is the best qualified person for the job in spite of his motherâ € ™ s vocal disapproval , @entity4 is still considered one of the leading candidates in the @entity56 field for the 2016 race			1
a @entity123 poll released today that examined potential candidateâ € ™ s standings in the primary battleground state of @entity127 had the former @entity54 governor tied with @entity129 for 12 per cent each and trailing @entity130 who held on to 24 per cent of the votes in spite of the @entity134 scandal			1
@entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 all followed			0
the field is quite a bit more narrow for the @entity143 , as former secretary of state @entity63 was the first pick for 57 per cent , followed by vice president @entity145 with 10 per cent and @entity146 with 8 per cent .			0

the @entity148 has *repeatedly* said that she thinks that there are too few families who have been in the @entity8
her son @entity4 , the former governor of @entity54 , is a top candidate for 2016
mrs @entity2 has previously said that the @entity20 , @entity19 and @entity18 are *examples* of families who have held on to office
admits that she thinks @entity4 is ' the best qualified '
