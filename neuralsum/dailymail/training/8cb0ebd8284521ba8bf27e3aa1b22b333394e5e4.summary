the forgotten victim of @entity3 cricket ’s civil war has dusted himself down , picked himself up and embarked on the new challenge he hopes will help him recover from the blow of missing out on the top job that looked certain to be his			1
@entity8 was , perhaps , the most unfortunate casualty of the fallout from an @entity12 disaster that saw @entity13 fall on his sword and @entity15 sacked amid bitterness and rancour that still rumbles on			1
@entity8 , 41 , had been earmarked to succeed @entity13 as team director when he was appointed one - day coach almost two years ago but his apprenticeship was nipped in the bud when @entity23 ’s world came crashing down			1
@entity8 missed out on @entity23 's top job in the fall out from the @entity12 disaster one of the heroes of @entity23 ’s greatest modern @entity12 victory a decade ago , @entity8 was unable to stem the bleeding after taking a wounded team to the @entity29 in march and he then found himself forced out in favour of @entity31			1
now , after a summer of reflection and new experiences , @entity8 has climbed back on the horse at one of @entity23 ’s biggest counties and finds himself charged with bringing the good times back to relegated @entity38			1
not only that , but the man who guided @entity40 to the @entity42 title has also taken on a new and very different challenge aimed at providing him with an alternative career when his coaching days are over			2
‘ i hurt throughout the summer , ’ admitted @entity8 , when looking back on his own sacking as @entity48 ’s new broom swept through @entity3 cricket			1
‘ it was painful and i was disappointed but i ’m not bitter			2
i ’ve got a job to do now			2
’ @entity8 has new career as cricket director and head coach at @entity38 the job that @entity8 looked destined to do was become @entity23 coach in a carefully worked out succession programme that started with him taking over the one - day side to allow flower more time to plan overall strategy			1
at the time , at the start of 2013 , it seemed the perfect antidote to crazy schedules but it quickly became clear that two very different men with very different ideas would bring confusion rather than clarity			0
test cricket has always been @entity23 ’s priority and @entity8 was all too often forced to lead @entity23 in limited - overs cricket without important players who had been made to rest by the demands of the itinerary			1
yet he still guided them to the brink of their first global 50 - overs title when they reached the @entity81 final and was favourite to succeed @entity13 when he took the team to @entity84 for the @entity29			1
failure there , and in particular defeat by @entity87 , cemented the mood for change and @entity8 found himself on the outside without really being given a proper opportunity to stamp his identity and methods on the post			1
@entity8 has dusted himself down , picked himself up and embarked on the new challenge ‘ was ( @entity87 ) the clincher for me ? i do n’t know , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ @entity97 seemed to be moving towards @entity31 before then but it clearly did n’t help			0
it just about wrapped up all that happened to @entity23 in the previous six months which was horrible for all of us			1
it took some getting over			0
’ @entity8 will not criticise the two - man coaching system which saw him lead the limited - overs teams while still being answerable to @entity13 , but it is clear he felt his hands were tied when he discusses his preferred working methods			1
‘ what i enjoy is leading my own environment and putting my stamp on it , ’ he told @entity107			0
‘ i like to take decisions knowing that they are on my head and that i ’m fully accountable for them			2
that ’s the way i like to work			0
’ he is equally loath to comment on @entity23 ’s continuing struggles in one - day cricket			1
@entity118 has now been axed for the @entity119 in february and @entity23 will hope the likes of @entity121 and @entity122 can get them off to a flyer @entity124			2
but @entity8 made an interesting observation on the perceived lack of dynamism when @entity118 was at the top of the batting order			2
‘ the most successful one - day sides do n’t necessarily start their innings any quicker than us , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ but what they do so well is go through the gears during an innings			0
we ’re still having trouble doing that			0
’ @entity8 was hurt by the @entity23 snub and required a summer of reflection to get over it @entity142 will be able to make all the big decisions at @entity144 as @entity38 ’s cricket director and head coach after taking his time in deciding what was next for him			1
‘ i just did n’t care any more after the @entity23 thing , ’ he admitted			2
‘ i needed a break after all that had happened and it was healthy for me to get away from it all			0
we went on a proper summer family holiday to the @entity155 , the first one i ’ve had since the kids were born , and i did a bit of media work with @entity160			0
‘ there was also a charity climb and cricket match at the top of @entity165 which was one of the toughest things i ’ve done but also one of the most rewarding			2
‘ i started to discover what i enjoy again but by the end of the summer i was desperate to get back in the game			0
’ he talked to @entity172 but they plumped instead for @entity173 , the former @entity174 batsman and @entity176 coach			2
‘ it ’s great to see him back , ’ said @entity8			2
then the chance came for him to join a @entity38 team who , with delicious irony , had been without a full - time coach since @entity31 left to take over @entity23 at the start of last season			1
@entity8 was often forced to lead @entity23 in limited - overs cricket without important players ‘ this is perfect for me and hopefully for @entity38 too , ’ said @entity8 , as he looked out at his new ‘ office ’ of @entity144			1
‘ i have started working with the players and so far so good			0
we ’re still unbeaten ! ‘ what strikes me is the size and history of this club			0
there are similarities with @entity40 and i feel privileged to be able to lead another big county			0
things are pretty healthy business-wise here now and we have a fantastic stadium			0
cricket-wise it ’s not too bad but there is work to do			0
’ @entity38 should belong in the first division competing for trophies but they have had an up - and - down time since @entity31 took them to that elusive @entity42 title three years ago			1
promotion is clearly a priority for @entity142 but he does not want to indulge in a short - term fix			2
‘ the aim is to build something deep - rooted that stands the test of time and will be in place long after i ’ve gone , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ we need stability , consistency and sustainability			0
it will take a few years to build that			0
the pressure will be on us to go straight back up but the most important thing is to put in place an underlying structure which will give us sustained success			0
’ @entity23 's shock defeat to @entity87 at @entity29 did n't help @entity8 ' predicament but is there the patience in modern sport , even the traditionally old - fashioned environment of county cricket , for a long - term plan ? as @entity8 found to his cost with @entity23 , the demand for results is instant			1
‘ it ’s a balancing act for sure , ’ he said			0
‘ i want to provide a strong pathway to the @entity38 team through all the age groups and plan for tomorrow while looking after today			1
‘ the temptation is to look at who you can recruit but i want to try to improve the guys under our noses			0
it ’s all very well changing things quickly but that usually does n’t work and if we bring anyone in they will have to fit in with our values			0
‘ social media has made for a society where everyone has a view and there ’s a pressure to build very quickly			0
i hope to be given the time to do this properly			0
look at @entity258 and the @entity23 rugby team			1
i think he ’s doing an excellent job and putting something in place that could pay real dividends along the line			2
but people are asking questions of his results all the time			0
’ not that @entity8 wants to spend all his time coaching			2
rather than think about a possible return to @entity23 in the future — managing director @entity48 said the job had come too soon for him when he appointed @entity31 — he has started to look at his long - term future			1
@entity31 ( left ) was appointed coach following the departure of @entity13 @entity8 is completing a masters degree in sports directorship at @entity279 with a view to taking a wider control of a sporting team			1
‘ after i ’d come round from the disappointment of @entity23 i realised i did n’t want to be caught in the coaching trap for ever , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ i do n’t want to be hitting catches when i ’m 50			0
this course is related to the business of sport and how the science works			0
it ’s a good mix. it ’s challenging but really enjoyable			0
’ so , instead of planning @entity23 ’s attempt at finally making a mark at a @entity119 , which appeared his destiny until he was rudely interrupted earlier this year , @entity8 has had plenty of other things on his plate			1
‘ if things were different i would n’t have climbed @entity165 , had a great holiday in @entity155 and undertaken a masters , ’ added @entity8			2
‘ and i would n’t be sitting here looking out over @entity301			0
