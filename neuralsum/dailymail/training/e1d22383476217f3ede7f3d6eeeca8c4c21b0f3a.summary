by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:58 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 06:39 est , 15 july 2013 @entity2 blundered on @entity3 today when he confused a cabinet minister with a spoof @entity3 account			1
the prime minister , who once warned ' too many tweets might make a tw * t ' , wrote this morning : ' we 're rolling out a cap on benefits today - @ @entity13 and i are determined to make work pay			1
' but @ @entity16 is not @entity18 @entity17 but a parody @entity3 account mocking the minister			1
gaffe : @entity2 's official account linked to the spoof @ @entity13 account which mocks the government reaction : the spoof account was quick to respond to the prime minister 's mistake blunder : work and pensions secretary @entity17 does not tweet , possibly heeding mr @entity2 's warnings about the perils of social media in fact mr @entity17 is not on @entity3 at all , preferring to spread his political message on tv and radio , where he today accused the @entity39 of being ' politically - motivated ' in its criticism of his reforms			1
the clues that the @ @entity13 account was not real were there			0
the account biography includes ' parodia ' and the phrase ' chin chin old bean '			0
the most recent tweet reads : ' i 've always supported a @entity53			0
your tax buys my mansion			0
@entity57 ! ' this morning the account reacted to the prime minister 's gaffe : ' @entity61			1
round mine for a @entity63 later ? ' the prime minister was trying to highlight the new benefits cap which means that the maximum amount of benefits a family can claim will be limited to £ 26,000 a year – a figure equal to a pre-tax salary of more than £ 34,000			1
parody : there were plenty of clues to the fact that the @ @entity13 account was not genuine jokes : the spoof account includes a stream of gags about the wealth of @entity83 cabinet ministers and their attitude to the poor cabinet minister @entity17 today accused the @entity39 of launching a ‘ politically - motivated ’ attack on government plans to cap benefits			1
in an extraordinary on - air blast , the @entity18 accused the corporation of using ‘ lots of little cases ’ to claim that limiting welfare payments would not get people back to work			2
mr @entity17 was grilled by @entity39 presenter @entity96 , after the today programme aired an interview with one benefits claimant who said she did not want to leave her home in @entity102 to find work			2
the minister tore into the @entity39 ’s attempts to undermine his reforms : ' what you are doing as always happens in the @entity39 is seeking out lots of little cases from people who are politically motivated to say this is wrong			0
’ under the benefits cap , couples and lone parents will not receive more than £ 500 a week under the new cap , with single people limited to £ 350 a week			2
the coalition argues it is fair on people who do work and pay taxes that those on state - funded benefits do not receive more than the average working family			2
mr @entity17 used an appearance on mr @entity2 ruled out joining @entity3 in 2009 after several high profile figures saw tweets backfire			2
the @entity83 leader told @entity128 ’s @entity127 breakfast show : ‘ the trouble with @entity3 , the instantness of it – too many twits might make a t * * *			0
’ since then the site has grown in popularity and he performed the u-turn in september last year			0
he has built up more than 360,000 followers , with a combination of policy announcements , insights into life in @entity141 and commenting on news events			0
th account is run by mr @entity2 and @entity83 aides and is separate to the official @entity146 feed for the prime minister			1
it is not thought that mr @entity2 wrote the message linking to the parody account , but his official spokesman said today : ' you can be clear that the prime minister 's tweets are entirely his views			1
' the spokesman tried to make light of the mix - up , adding : ' i think it 's hashtag one to take on the chin			0
' in an attempt to divert attention from the gaffe , the account later added : ' i 'm about to meet @entity168 president @entity167 - we 'll be discussing political and economic reform in @entity168			0

prime minister mistakenly links to parody account while *promoting* benefits cap
thought it was work and pensions secretary @entity17 - but he is not on @entity3
