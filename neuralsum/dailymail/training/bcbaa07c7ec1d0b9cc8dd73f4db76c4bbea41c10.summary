developers in @entity3 are promising wealthy tenants they will not have to share their smart lobby entrances , courtyard gardens or secure parking with people living in flats classed as ‘ affordable housing ’			1
the practice faces being banned in @entity20 after a backlash and has sparked a political row in the @entity23 with @entity24 condemning the covert ‘ segregation ’			1
when planning permission is granted , developers are often told to set aside a set number of units for affordable housing			1
from the outside , there is often no way of telling the more basic homes from the hi - spec apartments aimed at the super-rich			0
but behind the façade , less well - off tenants are forced to enter through different doors and use separate bicycle racks , bins and post boxes			1
@entity24 ’s shadow housing minister @entity54 told @entity1 : ‘ i am strongly against this kind of segregation			1
there should n’t be separate doors for people living in affordable housing			0
‘ many of the developers that i have been to have n’t had this distinction but i am deeply concerned that it is something happening in the @entity23			2

it would force affordable housing tenants at a high - rise next to the @entity78 to walk through an entrance located in a back alley behind the building to enter , leaving the more prominent front entrance for tenants paying for nicer apartments			0
@entity20 mayor @entity85 moved to say it should be allowed , blaming the previous administration of @entity88			2
a spokesman said : ‘ we fundamentally disagree with that approach , and we are in the process of changing it to reflect our values and priorities			0
‘ we want to make sure future affordable housing projects treat all families equitably			0
’ but according to a report in the @entity100 , many developments in @entity3 are promising wealthy prospective tenants the same segregation			1
it found a ‘ bespoke entrance lobby ... with the ambience of a stylish hotel reception area ’ at one @entity30			0
