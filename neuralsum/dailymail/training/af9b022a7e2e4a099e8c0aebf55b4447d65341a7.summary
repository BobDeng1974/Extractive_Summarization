pub quiz question : who were mrs @entity2 , mrs @entity3 , mrs @entity4 , mrs @entity5 and mrs @entity6 ? answer : they were famous housekeepers			1
but you get an extra point if you also knew that none was married			2
in the arcane world of upstairs - downstairs protocol , @entity6 was a courtesy title , implying respectability			2
marriage for a housekeeper , because it would have been ‘ a distraction from her service ’ , was actively frowned upon by employers , so they tended to be widows at best			1
by 1871 , there were 140,836 housekeepers in @entity22 , stern - faced and meticulous women for whom nothing was too much trouble if it ‘ added to the comfort ’ of the gentry			1
they were sad creatures really : abstainers , early risers , methodical , punctual , discreet , implacable			2
a housekeeper was in charge of everything from the store cupboards to the linen closets , ‘ a large bunch of keys clinking at the waist as they checked their housemaids ’ work ’			1
in service : @entity42 as mrs @entity6 in @entity43 she would busy herself repairing and replacing napkins , towels and dusters			1
she oversaw sewing and jam - making operations			2
when family members were due to arrive , she ensured there were ‘ no dust sheets on the furniture , fresh flowers in all the vases , beds aired , linen crisply ironed and every fireplace scoured and gleaming ’			2
it was the housekeeper ’s duty to conceal the ‘ frantic preparations behind the scenes ’			1
she was , says @entity64 , ‘ a senior management figure of absolute authority ’			1
or at least that has always been the supposition , and is how these female counterparts to butlers have been presented in films and fiction			0
the truth is more scandalous — this is one of those social history studies that uncovers such iniquities , the reader howls with rage			1
when @entity64 set out to discover the real human stories behind the green baize doors , the first thing she found was that allegedly beloved and valued housekeepers had no financial cushion , pension provision or job security			1
slaving until they were racked with rheumatism on their deathbeds , throughout the 19th century they were lucky to be paid £ 35 a year ( £ 1,500 today )			0
to put this in perspective , the average aristocrat earned an annual £ 60,000 from his estates ( £ 3.6 million today )			0
scandalous truth : being a housekeeper was n't as perfect as it appears to be in @entity43 furthermore , a housekeeper seldom emerged into the fresh air			1
they had to scurry along tunnels and passageways ( designed so that female staff never glimpsed stable lads ) and owing to these ‘ troglodyte conditions ’ often had an anaemic appearance and vitamin d deficiency			0
there was no sick pay , of course			0
a housekeeper had to be supplicatory , bowing and scraping			1
‘ she was entirely at the mercy of her mistress ’s good humour , ’ says @entity64 , and many of those old trouts could be ‘ prey to capricious mood changes and querulous demands ’			1
they would order , cancel and re-arrange lunch parties for 100 guests , heedless of the practicalities or disruption			0
when mrs @entity126 , housekeeper at @entity127 in @entity128 , got into an understandable muddle with the grocery budget owing to her mistress ’s extravagance , she was accused of embezzlement , put in prison and ended her days in @entity135			1
@entity136 as mrs @entity5 in @entity137 if @entity138 , @entity139 ’s housekeeper at @entity140 , ever had the cheek to risk a day off , she ’d come back to find the sink full of dirty dishes ‘ or the fridge full of rotting meat ’			1
she was n’t allowed feelings or a life of her own			0
@entity64 ’s most outrageous case , however , concerns mrs @entity149 , of @entity150 , one of the many seats of the @entity152			1
despite 14 years ’ devoted service , she was sacked for expecting a baby			0
‘ it would be a bad example to others , and a housekeeper who has maids to look after should not be bearing children even to their husbands , ’ thundered @entity155			1
mrs @entity149 , uniquely , was married — though mr @entity163 had to live separately in @entity164			0
the fact of the matter was that a pregnant servant had no rights			0
‘ servants were not supposed to have children , ’ says @entity64			1
‘ no matter what the circumstances — betrothed , seduced , raped — getting pregnant was grounds for immediate dismissal without a reference			0
’ two - thirds of the abandoned babies at @entity179 ’s @entity178 came from women in service			1
‘ another way out was infanticide			0
’ ( the late queen mother found an ingenious solution to the problem : at @entity187 she mostly hired gay men			0
) even though @entity150 was empty for all but six weeks of the year , ‘ it is quite impossible in such an establishment to permit her breeding ’ , @entity155 continued , outraged at mrs @entity149 ’s presumption			1
the housekeeper was given her marching orders			1
but first her bags were opened for inspection			0
they were found to contain ‘ quantities of tea , sugar , coffee , foreign wine , soap , candles and mops ’ — so in addition to being with child , the terrified woman was accused of pilfering			0
‘ it is dreadful to contemplate such depravity in one who had every confidence placed in her , ’ gasped her erstwhile employer melodramatically , no doubt thinking what an incursion had been made into the @entity152 ’s £ 200,000 annual income by those mops			2
@entity218 as mrs @entity4 in @entity219 if i ’d been mrs @entity149 , i ’d have burned the bloody house down			0
@entity64 failed to find out what happened next , but suspects the workhouse — from where mrs @entity149 ’s child would have been taken , and she herself would have ended her days ‘ eating gruel ’			1
one good thing about two @entity227 , the reader will concede , is that country house life was much retrenched by hostilities and the servants set free			2
@entity234 in @entity235 , for instance , changed its use ‘ from indulgent weekend chateau to war hospital ’			0
the housekeeper , mrs @entity239 , organised the conversion of the salons into wards			2
fine furniture and oil paintings were removed to the cellars			0
@entity246 eside the rococo marble fireplaces and beneath gilded ceilings , doctors amputated gangrenous limbs — the housekeeper attending as a nurse			2
one thing did n’t change : wounded officers could use the front door , but other ranks limped in through the servants ’ quarters			0
of the housekeepers remaining in 2014 , one is ms @entity261 at @entity262			2
‘ i ’m up close and personal with @entity264 ’s clothes , her shoes , her children , ’ she says			2
‘ i ’m part of an extended family			0
’ @entity269 is ‘ waging war on the moth infestation ’ , and feeds her ladyship ’s parrot , @entity273			2
even in the 21st century , however , @entity269 is aware that she ’ll be ticked off if she is over-familiar			0
@entity269 may be @entity269 to all , but @entity277 and @entity264 are always @entity277 and @entity264 , except i imagine to each other			0
‘ it ’s a humble position ; there is a lot of yes sir , no sir , ’ admits the thoroughly modern housekeeper			1
i do hope the excellent ms @entity261 garners more than £ 35 a year .			0

the housekeeper is thought of as a figure of absolute authority
but the scandalous truth is that they had no financial or job security
