a cafe claims to be cooking the biggest breakfasts in @entity2 by serving customers seven - pound fry - ups consisting of four times the daily calorie intake			1
@entity7 's ' the @entity6 ' weigh in at seven pounds each and diners have to sign a legal disclaimer before attempting to eat one as it adds up to 8,000 calories - four times the recommended daily intake			1
the meal , named ' the @entity6 ' , consists of eight rashers of bacon , eight sausages , four hash browns , four fried eggs , a four egg cheese omelette , four waffles , four pieces of toast , four pieces of fried bread , four black pudding , two ladles of beans , two ladles of tomatoes , mushrooms , a portion of large chips , and a two pint milkshake to wash it all down			1
right , the disclaimer customers must sign to acknowledge the health risks before attempting to eat it the @entity52 inspired challenge , sold for £ 19.95 , has only been attempted by 20 people since it was first added to the menu - and no one has since completed it			1
at around 14 times more calorific than a regular fry - up , the big breakfast takes around 30 minutes to cook and a disclaimer must be signed before challengers can dig in			1
mr @entity7 , 39 , who runs the @entity65 cafe in @entity66 , @entity63 said : ' i reckon with these ingredients you could feed a family for a week			1
' the breakfast alone is around 6,000 calories and the 2,000 calorie milkshake just tops it off			1
we weighed all the cooked food and it came to a whopping seven pounds			0
' that 's the weight of a baby			2
it 's called the @entity6 because if anyone completes it they 'll have to sleep for a year			1
' we have a disclaimer which says that no one under the age of 18 can take part and that they know about the very high calorific content and high fat content			2
we ask people to understand that they know what they are getting themselves into			0
they have to tick a box to say whether they have any underlying health conditions			0
' the @entity65 cafe in @entity63 , from where @entity7 serves his huge full @entity98 breakfast the breakfast is brought out on a 4ft turkey platter because mr @entity7 could n't find any plates big enough			1
challengers have an hour to eat the entire breakfast , including the milkshake			2
those who do eat the whole breakfast win £ 100 , get their name on the @entity108 , have the breakfast named after them and also get to add another ingredient to the challenge			0
he added : ' we used to set the time limit as half - an - hour but we realised that no one was ever going to finish it			2
although we did have one guy called @entity119 who nearly did it in half - an - hour but could n't make it to the end			0
' the @entity123 was named in honour of the @entity125 , a historical tale of the town 's attempts to buy a new fiercer bear for bear baiting in the 1620s			0
mr @entity7 said : ' i came up with the breakfast to get youngsters to come in and get involved			1
' most of my customers are in the 60s and 70s and the reason i came up with the @entity6 was to inject some youth into the place and i think it has			2
' younger guys come in , and it is all men who have tried the challenge , and they look at the ingredients up on the board and say : " i am going to smash that			0
" ' but then they see it come out on the big platter all heaped high and start to cry on the phone to their friends			0
they give up after about twenty minutes			0
' the cafe even has a ' green bucket ' which is brought out when a challenger fails to clean up the carnage left on the plate .			0
