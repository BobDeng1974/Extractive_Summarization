a rail passenger was said to have ' almost fainted ' after being presented with a £ 1,048 bill by ticket inspectors after mistakenly boarding the wrong train			1
the unnamed man , thought to be in his 40s , had been travelling from @entity7 new street station to @entity8 with a group of 38 family and friends			1
the group had bought tickets that only permitted them to travel on @entity16 services			0
the man was travelling from @entity17 to @entity8 with a group of 38 family and friends however , each member of the party unwittingly boarded a faster @entity22 service when they arrived on the platform			1
the mistake was spotted by ticket inspectors shortly after the 10.30am service had left @entity7 and was pulling in to @entity29 station			1
it was then that they were told that their tickets were not valid , and that they would have to purchase new tickets for the entire 1hr 25min journey			1
they were told that the cost for the group to travel to the next stop - 100 miles away in @entity39 – would cost them a total of £ 800 , while the price of completing their journey to @entity8 would be more than £ 1,000			0
the group were only permitted to travel on a @entity47 service from @entity7 to @entity8 they group each paid up after being told that they would face a large fine if they did n't buy the correct tickets			1
to make matters worse , they have since been told that had they booked in advance and taken advantage of @entity22 's offers for groups , they would have paid of maximum of less than £ 300 for the entire party – more than £ 700 cheaper than what they eventually paid			1
a fellow passenger told the @entity68 : ' it was a pretty heart - stopping moment			0
' he looked a little faint and i 'm not surprised really , i mean , it 's such a lot of money			0
the party have since been told that had they booked in advance and taken advantage of @entity22 's offers for groups , they would have paid of maximum of less than £ 300 – £ 700 cheaper than what they eventually paid ' the inspector was very matter of fact about it all and i understand he was doing his job – but it was an honest mistake			2
' i think allowances should be made when it does look like a genuine error			0
' the inspector told the party that he had clearly announced on board that tickets for any other operator would not be accepted on board the @entity97			0
@entity16 charges between £ 6 and £ 70 for a single adult ticket from @entity17 to @entity8 during weekdays , while @entity22 charges between £ 20 to £ 82 for an adult			2
the cost depends on whether passengers travel in standard class or first class			0
@entity22 states that it issues @entity106 ( @entity107 ) to customers travelling without valid tickets who are unable to pay at the time			1
a spokesman for the operator said : ' if people are travelling in large groups we encourage them to make the most of our group offers ; on our @entity7 to @entity8 route , fares would start at £ 7.50 for an adult single fare			2
' that would mean all 39 could have travelled for a maximum price of less than £ 300			0
' we run three trains an hour between @entity7 and @entity8 , with journey times of 1 hour 25 minutes			0
' unfortunately , if passengers have booked to travel with another operator their tickets are not valid on @entity22 ' services			2
