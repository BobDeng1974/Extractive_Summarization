@entity0 are prepared to take a gamble on @entity2 that they hope will pay off with a return to the @entity6			1
the 20 - year - old @entity8 forward will have his loan spell at @entity10 cut short having made just three substitute appearances and the foxes losing each game			1
@entity2 has long been hailed as one of @entity16 ’s great hopes but his attitude has been brought into question over recent seasons by coaches at @entity8 , @entity21 and now @entity10			1
@entity2 has struggled to make an impact at @entity10 after joining on loan from @entity8 the 20 - year - old has played just three times since joining in the summer , and his loan will be terminated @entity0 manager @entity27 is up for the challenge of turning round one of the country ’s most talented prospects but he will be wondering which @entity2 will turn up			1
a star made in @entity34 with the world at his feet , he announced his arrival with a thunderbolt goal in the 2 - 0 victory over @entity40 in the 2012 @entity42 play - off final at @entity43			2
it secured @entity34 ’s promotion to @entity46 and helped convince sir @entity47 to sign him for @entity8 in a deal worth £ 6m			1
@entity50 manager @entity49 bemoaned how @entity8 ’s financial muscle had blown them out of the water			1
@entity2 scored on his @entity8 debut against @entity21 and seemed tuned in to the task ahead			1
‘ it was great to make my debut , ’ he said after that game			2
‘ to then cap it off with a goal is what i ’ve been working for			2
@entity2 scored on his @entity8 debut against @entity21 , but has not pushed on as hoped since during his loan at @entity21 the young midfielder scored 12 goals , but his attitude was called into question ' @entity67 ( @entity68 , @entity34 ’s director of football ) used to say my game is n’t just attacking and defending , it ’s about goals as well and i proved that last season and hopefully i can do that for @entity8			1
' my dad will keep me in touch , i ’ll tell you that			2
i ’m just going to go home , have this great feeling and i ’ll keep myself on the ground			2
when i first came on it scared me a little bit , to be fair , because i ’m only used to 5,000 people now and then , but it ’s a great atmosphere – the fans are great			0
' it was n’t the hardest game because they made it easier for me but i ’m happy to be on the pitch getting minutes			0
' i learn every day , especially from the midfielders – @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 – they ’re all great , they ’ve all been through it and won trophies			0
that ’s what i want to do , so i hope to learn off them every day			0
’ @entity2 is sometimes criticised for his laid - back attitude , to the point at which some have called him idle the midfielder still has plenty of talent , and has played at the highest level , including the @entity106 he remained , understandably for his tender years , a peripheral figure and was loaned out to @entity21 the following season			1
a 12 - goal haul showed his loan was a success but it was not without the input of coach @entity115			0
his successor @entity116 struggled to draw the same impact			0
‘ he ’s got the talent but he just looks as if he ’s not interested , ’ said one coach			0
‘ he constantly needs pushing and you tell him some things and it seems to go over his head			0
it ’s as if football is his hobby not his profession			0
’ @entity8 staff talk of needing to supervise him in the gym and a laidback style that borders on idleness			1
‘ hopefully this will make him realise what he needs to do , ’ said the coach			0
‘ but you get the feeling he ’d be happy going back to @entity34			0

@entity2 has played just three times for @entity10 this season
@entity8 *youngster* has failed to *impress* , with @entity10 losing all three games
@entity2 *'s* attitude has been questioned , but @entity27 wants to sign him
@entity0 targeting unlikely promotion to @entity6 this season
