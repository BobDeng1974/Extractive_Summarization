' dr @entity33 , director for health protection and medical director at @entity2 , said : ' anyone who is well but may have been at increased risk of contact with the ebola virus will be given printed information and a @entity2 contact number to call in case they develop symptoms			0
temperature checks : a health official uses a thermometer at the arrivals hall of the airport in @entity50 , @entity51 ' people infected with @entity53 can only spread the virus to other people once they have developed symptoms , such as a fever			2
' even if someone has symptoms , the virus is only transmitted by direct contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person			0
' it ’s important to remember this is just one part of the screening process			2
@entity2 is also working with the international community and local health authorities to ensure robust exit screening remains in place at airports in @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 , which will pick up anyone who is symptomatic before they leave these countries			0
form : a copy of the questionnaire for passengers who have travelled from @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 ' although no system can completely prevent a case of @entity53 coming into the @entity84 , enhanced screening in high volume ports of entry will ensure that individuals at risk know exactly what to do if they start feeling ill , and can receive the expert advice they need immediately			1
' overall the risk of @entity53 in the @entity84 remains low , and we have a world - class domestic health system that is ready to respond if we do see a case in the @entity84			1
' passengers arriving from @entity84 from high - risk areas are being subject to screening at @entity18			1
they are being asked to complete a questionnaire asking about their current health and where they have come from			0
as well as personal details , including name , nationality , address in @entity84 and phone number they have been asked : the screening is taking place for passengers that @entity112 officers identify as having travelled from @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			2
passengers will have their temperature taken and complete a questionnaire asking about their current health , recent travel history and whether they might be at potential risk through contact with @entity53 patients			2
based on the information provided and their temperature , passengers will either be given advice and allowed to continue their journey , or undergo a clinical assessment by @entity2 staff and if necessary be taken to hospital for further tests			0
the @entity84 and the @entity131 have both introduced screening measures in response to the threat from @entity53 , which has killed more than 4,500 people in @entity20			1
it is believed that new screening procedures at @entity1 will affect passengers on about seven flights throughout the day			0
the @entity140 estimates that 85 per cent of all arrivals to the @entity84 from affected countries will come through @entity18 , where testing began last week			1
the testing descended into chaos on its first day however , after people flying to the @entity84 from high risk countries revealed the checks are not compulsory			1
but travellers at @entity149 this morning said the system is a ' complete joke ' because they were either not checked at all , told it was optional or had to seek out medical staff themselves			0
passport control : based on the information provided and their temperature , passengers will either be given advice and allowed to continue their journey , or undergo a clinical assessment by @entity2 staff and if necessary be taken to hospital for further tests avoid direct contact with sick patients as the virus is spread through contaminated body fluids wear goggles to protect eyes clothing and clinical waste should be incinerated and any medical equipment that needs to be kept should be decontaminated people who recover from @entity53 should abstain from sex or use condoms for three months after the complaints the @entity140 confirmed that screening travellers at major entry points into @entity84 is not mandatory unless they ' show symptoms of the virus '			1
this was despite warnings from the health secretary @entity183 , who said that it was essential for airline passengers from @entity20 to be checked for symptoms ' to make our country safe ' and warned the epidemic could be as deadly as @entity190			0
mr @entity183 also warned @entity84 should expect up to ten cases by @entity192 as screening of passengers from @entity73 , @entity75 and @entity74 , where 4,000 have died from @entity53 , started at @entity18 .			1
