click here for @entity2 's brilliant @entity1 from @entity4 's win over @entity5 @entity6 duly arrived , centre stage , on 75 minutes			1
the script had been prepared , with the match programme celebrating the fact that it was 16 years since the @entity4 captain , then a callow @entity9 youth , came off the bench to take the field at @entity16 for the first time			1
but the life of a footballer , like the seven ages of man , is cyclical			0
so at the age of 34 , @entity6 found himself back on the bench , four games in 10 days deemed a schedule too far for the @entity4 captain nowadays			1
in fact his manager , @entity26 , had n’t even realised the significance of the day until he saw the souvenir match programme			0
‘ i felt a bit bad then , ’ he said of his decision to rest @entity6			1

booked : @entity69 , @entity71 , @entity70 referee : @entity87 attendance : 44,735 player ratings from @entity90 at @entity16 but with the game locked at 0 - 0 , with both sides sensing a victory , it seemed natural that the captain should take the field to finish the job			1
of course , football does n’t always work out quite so simply and the best scriptwriters love a good twist			0
@entity16 had the finale it desired but it was @entity33 who provided the heroics on 85 minutes			1
there was a lovely cross from @entity55 , met quite magnificently by @entity61 , whose header crashed against the bar			2
as the rebound dropped , it was clear there was a race on between @entity33 ’s head , the boot of @entity68 and the onrushing presence of @entity67			1
you could not have blamed @entity33 for flinching but he ensured his head was there first , shortly after followed by @entity68 ’s boot			1
and the fact that @entity6 was a mere bystander for the goal barely diminished from the drama			1
it was @entity33 ’s last contribution to the game — the cut to his head meant that treatment was required — but it was mightily significant for this game			1
whether the same can be said for @entity4 ’s season remains a moot point			1
this was undoubtedly a desperately needed victory for @entity4 , the last in the @entity132 having come at @entity133 more than a month ago			1
if wednesday night ’s draw against @entity136 was the turning point of which @entity26 spoke , this at least was another step in the right direction			0
however , there is still an awful lot of hard work to be done before @entity4 are truly in the ascendant again			1
the fact that of the £ 120million spent on talent last summer , only @entity61 could make the starting line - up , is an indication of the deeper malaise at the club at present			2
‘ we need players at this time who have quality and experience , ’ @entity26 explained			0
‘ the guys who came in ( in the summer ) , the younger players will get their chance			0
right now we need confidence and experience in the team			0
’ but there was precious little to commend in the first - half performance			2
@entity4 conceded possession cheaply , failed to read each other ’s movements and created almost nothing			1
on 27 minutes , @entity61 lifted a free - kick high into the @entity16 stand ; it was noteworthy only in that it was the first attempt either side had contrived			1
@entity5 had been little better but at least as the visitors , there was less onus on them to attack			2
@entity4 striker @entity61 ( left ) vies for the ball in the air with @entity5 central defender @entity70 in the early stages @entity4 central defender @entity53 ( left ) and @entity59 ( right ) out jump @entity5 forward @entity75 @entity4 striker @entity179 is all smiles as he looks on from the stands of @entity16 during the first half of the match @entity4 midfielder @entity56 ( middle ) faces up against @entity5 trio @entity69 ( left ) , @entity185 and @entity70 @entity26 ’s principal problem is that @entity4 of course are now judged by much higher standards due to the excitement they generated last season and those opening 45 minutes felt a world away from those heady days			1
thankfully , the second half improved considerably , with @entity79 and @entity195 both demonstrating the vitality of youth and technique			0
@entity79 , in particular , was a hub of creativity for @entity5			2
he fed @entity80 with a delightful ball on 58 minutes which @entity51 did well to smother ; he hit the post on the hour , having skipped past @entity58 ; and right at the death he executed a volley from outside the box of which @entity206 would be proud and which @entity51 did superbly to tip over			0
‘ he was the outstanding player , ’ said his manager @entity207 of the former @entity209 child star			0
‘ everyone can see the quality he has			0
he is getting stronger in every game			0
he is enjoying the @entity132 , enjoying playing for us			2
we need to give him the ball more often because he has the ability to produce @entity4 captain @entity6 looks on from the bench during the first half after being rested for the match @entity4 midfielder @entity195 ( right ) attempts to shield the ball away from @entity5 midfielder @entity76 @entity5 forward @entity79 ( left ) attempts to break away with the ball from @entity4 central midfielder @entity55 @entity4 manager @entity26 looks cheerful during the first half as his side is held at deadlock by @entity5 at @entity16 @entity4 central midfielder and captain for the day @entity55 ( right ) rises for the ball with @entity5 's @entity72 @entity195 was attempting to do something similar for @entity4 , wriggling his way through a forest of defenders on 61 minutes but pulling his shot just wide			1
he then fed @entity58 on 65 minutes , giving the @entity233 a clear sight of goal , which he wasted by shooting straight at @entity67			0
@entity33 then pressed forward and fed @entity61 , who again shot at @entity67			2
but the best chance of all came when @entity195 squeezed the ball back to @entity59 , who , eight yards from goal , lifted the ball high and over and into the @entity239 on 69 minutes			0
at least there was attacking intent and creative combinations around the box			0
@entity4 were looking a little bit more like their old selves			2
true , @entity195 had to save his team , chesting a @entity80 shot off the line on 82 minutes with the score still 0 - 0			2
but ultimately it would be a day which @entity26 could enjoy , skipping down the touchline in celebration when the goal did come			0
‘ i think with the way i like to play football people think i want to win 5 - 3 and 6 - 4 , ’ said @entity26			0
‘ but i am equally happy to win 1 - 0			0
’ for now that is enough for @entity4			2
@entity5 manager @entity207 gestures on the touchline at @entity16 while @entity4 boss @entity26 takes notes behind him @entity4 's defensive midfielder @entity58 feels the pain as he is challenged by @entity5 midfielder @entity262 @entity5 defender @entity70 uses @entity4 forward @entity61 to hoist himself up to win a header in their ongoing battle @entity4 captain @entity6 was finally introduced for @entity4 for @entity58 after 75 minutes at @entity16 on saturday @entity4 right back @entity33 stuck his head in late on to net the much needed winner in the 85th - minute click here for the @entity1 of @entity33 's winner and all the stats from @entity4 's victory over @entity5			1

@entity33 scores a late header to give @entity4 a much - needed victory at @entity16
the victory is the first for the @entity280 in the @entity132 in over a month and just their fifth of the season
@entity6 started from the bench and came on after 75 minutes in 16 - year *anniversary* of his debut
@entity5 drop to 12th in the @entity132 table while @entity4 rise one place above them to 11th
