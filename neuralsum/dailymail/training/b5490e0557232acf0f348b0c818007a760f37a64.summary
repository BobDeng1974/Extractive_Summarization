most people would have to be paid large sums of money to even consider swallowing an amputated human toe			1
but one customer at the @entity5 in @entity6 threw down $ 500 for the privilege before gulping one down			1
the incident took place at the famous saloon in @entity12 , @entity13 , on saturday night and staff there said it 's not the first time it has happened , but the first time it was done deliberately			0
the customer must drink the shot and have the toe touch their lips			2
the idea of the @entity24 started in september 1973 , when riverboat captain @entity29 found a severed big toe preserved in a pickle jar			1
captain @entity29 somehow got the idea of making a game with it and came up with the original rules for the drink over the course of a drunken evening with friends - take a beer glass full of champagne , drop in the toe , tip the glass back … and the toe must touch the lips			1
in september 1973 , eight people participated in the first attempt ; nearly four decades later , the @entity72 has an estimated 100,000 - plus members			1
any liquor can be used in the cocktail , but the norm now is a shot of @entity79 whiskey			0
it costs just $ 5 and for that you sign a log book and get a certificate confirming you as a member of the @entity72			2
one rule must be adhered to however : ' you can drink it fast , you can drink it slow			0
but the lips have got ta touch the toe			2
' it has been described by members of the club as a ' leathery piece of jerky with a toe nail attached '			1
it costs $ 5 and the drinker signs a logbook and gets a certificate from the night 's ' toe captain ' confirming their membership to the @entity72			1
the drink can be anything , as long as the following rule is applied : ' you can drink it fast , you can drink it slow			0
but the lips have got ta touch the toe			2
' @entity108 was the ' toe captain ' of the bar on saturday night when the patron - known only as ' @entity111 ' - came in , threw $ 500 on the table and drank down the shot of whiskey - toe and all			1
he said the latest toe was ' mummified ' with salt , and plunked into drinks for brave patrons about 30 to 40 times per night			1
@entity108 told @entity121 the customer was an @entity123 who had been living in @entity6 for the summer , he had just picked up his rent deposit and was leaving town			0
the posted fine for swallowing the toe is $ 500			1
it has since been raised to $ 2,500			1
speaking to @entity130 about what happened , he said : ' this guy popped it in his mouth , takes $ 500 out of his pocket and slams it on the table and starts walking away			2
' i said , " where ’s the toe ? " and he said , " i swallowed it "			0
' throughout the 40 - year tradition , more than 100,000 people have joined the @entity24 club			1
the @entity145 started in september 1973 when a local eccentric named captain @entity29 found a severed toe preserved in a jar			1
he came up with the original rules for the drink over the course of a drunken evening with friends : take a beer glass full of champagne , drop in the toe , tip the glass back			0
since then a number have been swallowed , lost or destroyed - eight in total - but fortunately for the bar , they always manage to find someone to donate a new toe			2
@entity108 said they have a backup toe but like to keep two at a time so are on the hunt looking for a new one			0
he told @entity121 : ' we like to have two toes - we switch them off once a week - and now we ca n't do that			0
we 're putting it out there , if you have a spare toe , hey we need one			0
' @entity177 : while it may sound unsanitary , the toes are pickled for months in medical alcohol and then packed in dry salts so pose no health risks to drinkers new member : a female customer prepares to take the @entity24 challenge so she can join the prestigious club down in one : the famous tradition is mentioned in guide books and people have come from far and wide to become members of the @entity72 @entity108 said they are now looking for more toes : ' we like to have two toes - we switch them off once a week - and now we ca n't do that			1
we 're putting it out there , if you have a spare toe , hey we need one ' any drink can be used in the shot , as long as the following rule is applied : ' you can drink it fast , you can drink it slow			0
but the lips have got ta touch the toe ' the toe is believed to belong to @entity210 , a chain - link fence installer in @entity212 , who got his pinkie toe amputated in january 2000 after developing hammertoe			2
he kept it in a jar in his freezer and donated it in april 2002			0
manager at the @entity221 told the @entity222 last year : ' we 've had people throwing up , we 've had people gagging on their drinks			2
' @entity227 trouble is when someone gets overenthusiastic			0
you never know when some fool is going to do something stupid			0
and then we 'll be without a toe			0

the 40 - year tradition was started by captain @entity29 after he found a severed toe in a jar
