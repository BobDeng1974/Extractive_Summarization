just an hour ’s drive from @entity2 and under the flight path of a major airport , it hardly seems the spot for a pastoral idyll			1
but if you are looking for the best quality of life away from the rat race , the little - known district of @entity8 in @entity9 has just topped a survey of the best rural places to live			2
despite its biggest claim to fame being that it is the home of @entity20 , the area has just beaten 118 other non-metropolitan regions in @entity22 on factors such as health , life expectancy , employment , weather , wages and school results			1
far from the crowds : the market square of @entity32 , a town of 14,000 people cottages : towns such as @entity37 are popular destination for @entity39 who want to leave the metropolis but continue to work there and according to the report by banking giant @entity46 , more than eight out of ten people in @entity8 think ‘ what they do in life is worthwhile ’			2
the study , which is published today , also shows that the district ’s residents are comparatively wealthy , with average weekly earnings of £ 819 – compared to £ 608 across the rest of the country			1
and not surprisingly given its proximity to the capital , the employment rate is also far higher than the average for rural districts at 84 per cent , in contrast to just 74 per cent nationally			1
colourful : people living in the @entity9 district are comparably wealthier and live longer than those in other metropolitan areas @entity68 : an idyllic cottage surrounded by fields filled with daffodils in the village of @entity73 in the @entity9 district but homes in the local authority area – which encompasses the towns of @entity32 , @entity77 , @entity37 and the village of @entity79 – are far from cheap			2
as a popular destination for @entity39 who want to leave the metropolis but continue to work there , the area ’s average house price is seven times higher than the salary of a typical local			1
however the houses are at least bigger than most , averaging 6.4 rooms – more than anywhere else in the country , and equal to @entity92 and @entity93			1
it is the first time that @entity8 has won the top prize in @entity46 ’s annual research			2
claim to fame : the district is just an hour 's drive from @entity2 and under the flight path of @entity20 airport but it has rarely been out of the top five , and has gradually been promoted up the table			1
it came fourth in 2010 , third in 2011 and second in 2013			0
other places in the top ten include @entity107 , @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and the @entity113			0
overall , the best places to live are dominated by the @entity115 , the @entity116 and the @entity117			0
of the top 50 local authority districts , 12 were in the @entity117 , nine in the @entity116 and 15 in the @entity117			0
by comparison , just two were in @entity120 and two were in the @entity122			0
the report defined rural districts as ones in which the majority of residents live in towns or villages , with a population of fewer than 10,000 people			0
rural areas in the @entity117 tend to be better for employment , earnings , health and weather , while the @entity141 fares better for school exam results , a lower house price to earnings ratio , traffic flow and less overcrowding			1
however for those looking for sunshine , the @entity143 is the safest bet , while to avoid being burgled – and for the best chance of being happy – the @entity146 are the best place to be in the @entity22			0
as well as looking at rural quality of life , @entity46 also compiles an annual report on the best areas to live generally , which is normally won by @entity153 in @entity154			0
the top ten rural places to live in @entity22 are : @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity107 , @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 in @entity156 , @entity112 , @entity113 in @entity157 , @entity92 in @entity158 , @entity159 , and @entity160 in @entity161 .			0
