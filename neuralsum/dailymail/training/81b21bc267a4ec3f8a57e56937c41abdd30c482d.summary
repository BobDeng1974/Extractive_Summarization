archaeologists may have recovered a skeleton from a large burial mound in @entity3 , but now they are hopeful there could be more to find			1
experts have opened the second phase of their excavation of the vast 4th - century @entity9 tomb in search of more burial chambers			1
they hope these chambers may hold ancient members of the @entity15 royal family , or the legendary warrior king @entity16 himself			1
experts have opened the second phase of their excavation of the vast 4th - century @entity9 tomb ( pictured ) in search of more burial chambers that they hope may hold ancient member of the @entity15 royal family , or legendary warrior king @entity16 himself the team will scan two hectares ( five acres ) of the vast mound to look for clues about what may lie beneath			1
the first search of the site , which was built shortly after @entity16 's death , yielded an elaborately decorated tomb containing a skeleton , as well as large sculptures and a beautiful mosaic floor			1
earlier this month , experts analysing the skeleton found in the vault , claimed that the person who was buried there was male and probably an ' important general '			1
he was of medium height with pale skin and brown or red hair , they said , suggesting that the remains could belong to blue - eyed king , @entity16 himself , who was reputed to have strawberry blonde hair			2
geophysicists will scan two hectares ( five acres ) of the vast mound to look for clues about what may lie beneath			1
this image shows one of its entrances , guarded by two mythical sphixes experts believe the ancient mound , situated around 65 miles ( 100km ) from @entity56 ( shown on the map ) was built for a prominent @entity15 in around 300 to 325 @entity9 analysis of the skeleton discovered in an underground vault has revealed the man buried there was of medium height , with pale skin and brown or red hair ( illustrated )			1
while some experts dare to hope it could be @entity16 himself , others say that even the skeleton 's gender is in doubt skeletal remains show the man buried in the @entity3 tomb was of medium height with pale skin and brown or red hair			1
he must have been of high social status , based on his opulent final surroundings			0
archaeologists say he was probably an important general , although because the tomb was looted in antiquity , no shield or sword have been found , which were typically buried with @entity15 warriors			1
experts are studying the bones to reveal what the man died of and what he ate			0
however , doubt has now been cast on this and some experts claim the sex of the remains is not known			0
@entity98 , head of the @entity100 excavation said that the man was probably of high status , but because robbers removed valuable items in antiquity , no weapons or precious objects remain in situ			0
the skeleton is undergoing dna analysis to deduce if the man was a member of the @entity15 royal family , as well as to learn his age			1
@entity112 culture minister @entity111 visited the burial mound to announce the new phase of the exploration			1
geophysicists are scanning the site to see if there are other structures besides the impressive , three - chamber tomb discovered in august			2
the area being scanned is about one - seventh of the total area of the mound			2
scientists will compare the dna of the bones to that of @entity130 , who was buried at @entity131 , but this will be difficult because the genetic material is ' overworked , ' @entity124 , the culture ministry 's general secretary told @entity134			2
the bones of @entity138 - father of @entity16 - were burnt and because dna tests were carried out some 50 years ago , it is feared the results may have been contaminated			1
the skeletal remains were found both inside and outside the rectangular stone - lined cist ( pictured ) , under the floor of the cavernous , vaulted structure that is 26 feet ( eight metres ) tall			0
they are undergoing dna analysis there has been speculation that the tomb could be that of @entity16 ( a mosaic depicting the king is shown )			1
examinations of the remains have established they belong to a man who was a general while the announcement was made about the skeleton ’s identity , some experts claim that its gender is uncertain			2
identifying it may never be possible , even if its dna is checked , said ms @entity124			0
speculation on the identity has been rife among experts , including theories that the remains are of @entity16 's mother , widow , son , half - brother , or @entity173 , one of @entity16 's closest aides and an @entity3 native			1
meanwhile , archaeologists are still uncovering multicoloured decorations found inside the dug up tomb			2
and lasers will be used to study them , ms @entity124 said			0
@entity112 ’s @entity182 revealed earlier this month that the body had been placed in a wooden coffin , which disintegrated over time			2
the skeletal remains were found both inside and outside the rectangular stone - lined cist , under the floor of the cavernous , vaulted structure that is 26ft ( eight metres ) tall iron and bronze nails , as well as carved bone and glass decorations from the coffin , were also found scattered in the grave			0
archaeologists in the past have said the grave likely belonged to a prominent @entity15 – possibly a military man			2
clockwise from top right shows two headless , marble sphinxes found above the entrance to the barrel - vaulted tomb , details of the facade and the lower courses of the blocking wall , the antechamber 's mosaic floor , a 4.2 - metre long stone slab , and the upper uncovered sections of two female figures			0
the second and third chambers , not pictured , have not yet been explored archaeologists are now searching for more burial chambers and bodies hidden in the vast mound , they have already uncovered many sculptures such as this bust , thought to be the head of a sphinx @entity16 of @entity223 was born in @entity224 , the ancient capital of @entity225 in july 356 bc. he died of a fever in @entity227 in june 323 bc. @entity16 led an army across the @entity230 territories of @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 claiming the land as he went			1
his greatest victory was at the @entity236 , now northern @entity237 , in 331 @entity9 , and during his trek across these @entity230 territories , he was said to never have suffered a defeat			2
this led him to be known as @entity16			0
following this battle in @entity236 , @entity16 led his army a further 11,000 miles ( 17,700km ) , founded over 70 cities and created an empire that stretched across three continents			0
this covered from @entity112 in the west , to @entity233 in the south , @entity249 in the north , and @entity252 @entity251 to the @entity253			0
@entity16 was buried in @entity233 , but it is thought his body was moved to prevent looting			2
his fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near @entity131 , far to the west			0
the lavishly - furnished tomb of @entity16 's father , @entity261 , was discovered during the 1970s			1
the @entity262 said : ' it is probably the monument of a dead person who became a hero , meaning a mortal who was worshipped by society at that time			0
' the deceased was a prominent person , since only this could explain the construction of this unique burial complex			0
' ‘ it is an extremely expensive construction , whose cost , clearly , is unlikely to have been borne by a private citizen			0
' @entity279 , a professor of archaeology at the @entity281 who has not been involved with the dig , said the human remains should provide valuable information on the occupant of the tomb , which at about 49 ft ( 15 metres ) long and 15 ft ( 4.5 metres ) wide is one of the biggest ever found in the country			0
the ministry confirmed fears that the tomb had been thoroughly and repeatedly plundered during antiquity			0
‘ whatever objects of value the first thieves missed was taken by others later , ’ professor @entity279 said			0
excavations at the site in north eastern @entity112 near the city of @entity56 began in 2012			0
they captured global attention in august when archaeologists announced the discovery of vast tomb guarded by two sphinxes and circled by a 497 - metre marble wall			1
since then the tomb has also yielded a mosaic made of coloured pebbles depicting the abduction of @entity312 , the daughter of @entity314 , as well as two sculpted female figures also known as @entity316			0
the tomb dates to 300 - 325 bc. @entity16 died in 323 bc after a military campaign through the @entity253 , @entity231 and northeast @entity319			1
surviving fragments of carved bone and glass coffin ornaments were found in the tomb at @entity3 , but no helmet , shield or military objects which would be expected in the tomb of a @entity15 soldier were recovered making the skeleton 's identity largely guess work at this stage a large , damaged mosaic floor of the ancient @entity112 god of the underworld , @entity336 , abducting the goddess @entity312 on a horse - drawn chariot as the god @entity341 looks on , was found in the tomb			1

experts have opened the second phase of their excavation of the vast 4th - century @entity9 tomb in @entity3 , northern @entity112
they hope it holds members of the ancient @entity15 royal family
the skeleton discovered in the tomb is still undergoing dna analysis
reports suggest the tomb was built for a @entity15 general , but its thought the skeleton may be @entity16 himself
archaeologists will scan two hectares ( five acres ) of the vast mound to look for clues about what may lie beneath - hopefully more chambers
