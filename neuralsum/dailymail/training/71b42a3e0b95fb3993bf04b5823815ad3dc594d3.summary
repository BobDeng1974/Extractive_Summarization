by @entity0 published : 22:55 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 22:55 est , 17 july 2013 almost two fifths of @entity4 recruits have the reading level of an 11 - year - old , mps warned today			1
a similar proportion can only do maths aimed at pupils in their final year of primary school , according to a report by the commons defence select committee			0
the @entity4 , @entity14 and the @entity15 have a good record in improving the maths and @entity19 skills of young recruits and trainees who join with low levels of qualifications , the study found			1
@entity1 ' warning : almost two fifths of @entity4 recruits have the reading level of an 11 - year - old			1
in this file picture , a @entity26 is seen on patrol through the @entity29 in @entity31 province , @entity32 the minimum requirement of new recruits is ‘ entry level 2 ’ , the report says - equivalent to the standard expected of a seven or eight - year - old in literacy and numeracy			1
of those who were recruited in 2012 , all of those who joined the @entity15 or the @entity14 were above entry level 2 , found the study , which looked at the education levels of the armed forces			1
but 39 per cent of the @entity4 had a literacy level of an 11 year old , and 38 per cent had this level of ability in numeracy			1
it also found that 3.5 per cent of the @entity4 were reading at the level of a seven or eight - year - old , while 1.7 per cent were at this standard in maths			2
the @entity56 had told the committee that it recruits service personnel at whatever level of attainment is available , the report says , adding that if this is the case , then it should take action when entry standards are particularly low			2
it says that in light of planned changes to the three services , ‘ it may be that recruiting personnel with higher levels of attainment would better meet the future needs of the armed forces			0
’ ‘ the @entity56 should identify how it might raise the basic entry level and still recruit sufficient personnel , ’ the report says			0
education : the report said 39 per cent of the @entity4 had a literacy level of an 11 year old , and 38 per cent had this level of ability in numeracy ( file picture ) the committee goes on to suggest : ‘ whilst we recognise that some recruits may not have done well in their previous academic careers and may not be eager to take further academic exams , the @entity56 should encourage more recruits to undertake @entity19 and @entity82 which would stand them in good stead for future employment			1
’ provisions : @entity91 chair @entity90 said it is ' vital ' that service personnel receive ' excellent education ' young servicemen and women are being offered ‘ challenging and constructive ’ education and employment opportunities , the cross-party group of mps acknowledge			0
the committee also raises concerns that the @entity4 is dependent on recruiting 16 and 17 - year - olds			2
more than one in four ( 28 per cent ) of @entity4 recruits are under the age of 18 when they join , compared with 5 per cent for the @entity15 and 8 per cent for the @entity14			1
‘ we support the armed forces ' provision of challenging and constructive education and employment opportunities for young people , ’ the report says			0
‘ but we would welcome further information on why the @entity4 is so dependent on recruiting personnel under the age of 18 years compared to the other two services , and whether steps are being taken to reduce this dependency			2
’ @entity91 chair @entity90 said : ‘ it is vital we provide excellent education for our personnel not just for their own career development but also to give them confidence that when the time comes to leave the service they will be able to transfer to a civilian career			0
' the @entity125 mp for @entity126 added : ‘ they are more likely to remain in the service if this is the case			0
' we welcome the work that has been done to increase the number of areas where personnel can acquire a civilian qualification and we would like to see this work further extended			0
