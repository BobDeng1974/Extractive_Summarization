two @entity1 high - school football players accused of raping a teenage girl may not get a fair trial after a photo and video allegedly associated with the case were posted on the internet by the computer hacking group @entity8 , a lawyer for one of the accused said on friday			1
@entity13 and @entity14 , both 16 and members of the @entity17 football team , are charged with raping a 16 - year - old fellow student last august , according to statements from their attorneys to local and national media			1
their juvenile court trial is scheduled for february in @entity24 , a city of 19,000 about 40 miles west of @entity25			1
scroll down to watch video extract taking action : the so - called ' hacktivist ' group @entity8 made a video announcing their plan to ' out ' people involved in the alleged coverup of the incident the case shot to national prominence this week when @entity8 activists made public a picture allegedly of the rape victim , being carried by her wrists and ankles by two young men , and of a video that showed several other young men joking about an alleged assault			1
horrific : attendees at the various parties posted pictures of the two suspects dragging the seemingly unconscious victim around because she was too drunk to move @entity52 's lawyer , @entity51 , said on @entity53 that his client was one of the young men in the photograph , but does not appear in the video			1
but the picture ' is out of context , ' @entity51 said			2
' that young lady is not unconscious , ' as has been widely reported			2
' a right to a fair trial for these young men has been hijacked , ' @entity51 said , adding that social media episodes such as this have become a major threat to a criminal defendant 's right to a fair trial			1
' it 's very , very serious and fairness is essential to getting the right decision here , ' he said			2
@entity14 ' attorney @entity73 could not immediately be reached for comment on friday			2
in an interview on thursday with @entity78 , @entity1 , broadcaster @entity76 , @entity73 raised concerns about the effect the @entity8 postings could have on potential witnesses in the case			0
' this media has become so astronomically ingrained on the @entity86 and within that society , i am concerned witnesses might not want to come forward at this point			0
i would be surprised now , if there were n't witnesses now who might want to start taking the @entity92 , ' @entity73 told the station			0
laughing boy : the ' star ' of the video is @entity97 , a former @entity24 student who ca n't contain his laughter as he describes the ' dead ' victim , seemingly in another room of the house offensive : a number of offensive comments about the alleged rape were made online , including this one on @entity106 ; detectives are now trawling through the online exchanges for more evidence the fifth amendment to the @entity111 offers protection against self - incrimination in criminal proceedings			1
the case has also been a challenge for local officials because of conflicts of interest			0
both the local prosecutor and police have close ties to the school that the defendants attend			0
as a result , the case is being investigated and prosecuted by @entity1 attorney general @entity128 's office			0
interviewed on @entity53 on friday , @entity128 said it was not unusual for his office to prosecute or investigate cases in small towns where close ties within the community caused conflicts of interest to arise			0
fan frenzy : the @entity17 plays their home games at a 10,000 seat stadium , where they are broadcast on local television allegation : both of the boys facing charges are students at @entity17 and were on the school 's prestigious football team he also voiced concern about how social media may affect the case			1
' this case needs to be tried not in the media , not in social media , ' @entity128 said			2
he said @entity8 ' attempt to shame the alleged attackers had actually harmed the victim			0
not only is the victim hurt by the initial crime , but ' every time something goes up on the @entity86 , the victim is victimized again , ' @entity128 said .			0
