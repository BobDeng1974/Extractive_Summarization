by @entity0 for @entity1 it 's a phrase you never stop hearing : the modern woman can have it all			2
but for one in four women aged 45 or over in @entity8 , one thing they will never have is a family of their own			1
@entity11 , 39 , from @entity12 tried for a baby for 15 years : from the age of 22 , all she wanted to do was have children			1
fifteen years on and ten rounds of @entity17 later , she started going though the early menopause aged just 37 , ending her dreams of ever becoming a mother			2
scroll down for the video having family is one of most women 's priorities , but soon one in four will reach 45 without having a baby ( posed by model ) @entity11 put off going to university in order to start a family straight after getting married , with her main aim in life being having a brood of children living under her roof			1
the thought of it never happening had never even occurred to her			2
she told @entity1 : ' i spent 15 years in a baby bubble , it was all i ever thought about			2
' my whole life was focused on having a baby , when i was n't having treatment i lived my life in four week cycles			1
' i stayed in really dull jobs because of the maternity benefits they would offer , i lived extremely healthily			2
' i tried various different fertility drugs , i also tried herbal @entity52 teas , which were foul			0
' i was told that cough medicine might help , so i took that even when i did n't have a cough			0
' @entity55 said , i would try			0
' struggling to conceive can place serious strain on a couple 's relationship ( posed by model )			0
@entity11 believes the problems affected her first marriage , she said : ' not being able to have children certainly was n't the only reason that we broke up , but it definitely had an impact			1
' the strain of trying for a baby did n't just impact on @entity11 's own emotional health - she and her first husband divorced when was 30			1
she said : ' this is my second marriage			0
i was first married at 22 and we started trying for children immediately , but then we were divorced by 30			1
' not being able to have children certainly was n't the only reason that we broke up , but it definitely had an impact , especially when all of our family and friends were having children			1
' then i started another relationship at 32 , which was with is the man i am now married to			0
' so we only went through five years of trying for a child together			0
' during the 15 years of trying , like most women who are struggling to conceive , @entity11 's situation was made more difficult by several other factors in her life , including her friends having babies , but also the comments and questions about her struggle that came from well - meaning individuals			1
she said : " we 're really lucky in that we 've been really open with our friends , so they 're great , but that 's not to say it has n't been hard at times			0
' there were always conversations that would crop up with people who wanted to know why i did n't have children yet			1
' we call them " bingos " at @entity106 - the community for childless women that she attends - @entity104 are the same conversations that you have with lots of people			0
' people try to be helpful and discuss the issue , but you just get the same questions over and over again			0
even when women have overcome the upset of being unable to conceive , the stress and emotions can rise again when their friends and family members become grandmothers			1
' they think that you have n't considered a whole load of things , when of course you have - it 's all you think about			0
' things like , have you thought about adoption ? of course ! ' then two years ago , @entity11 was given the news she had been dreading - that she would never be able to get pregnant			1
she said : ' i was 37 , which although it is quite young compared to most people in my situation , was n't really for me because i started trying when i was 22 , so i had done a 15 - year stint			1
' i was told the only option was adoption or egg donation and i initially thought , " yes ! let 's try that ! " ' but for various reasons , my husband and i have decided it was n't right for us			0
' so i had this moment of realisation - that this thing i had wanted for so long was never going to happen			0
' i had a lot of grief and went through a very difficult time after that , there was a while when i could n't see anyone with children anymore			1
' and of course , i do still sometimes look at my friends who have kids and think that could have been my life			1
' but after two difficult years , @entity11 and her husband have now come round to the idea of having life without children			1
she said : ' being honest and open about it really helped me			0
' we do n't hear about women that pregnancy does n't happen for , we only hear about the miracles cases - the ones where it works , ' going to @entity106 has been a massive part of my recovery			0
' i am now studying psychology at @entity174 - i am very interested in what makes people work			0
' and apart from that , she and her husband are just waiting to see what the future will bring them			0
she said : ' sometimes when you 're in my situation , people think you must do something really amazing with your life , but we decided we 're happy as long as our life has meaning to us			1
' because you put so much pressure on yourself when you are trying for a child that it is nice to just calm down for a bit afterwards			2
' @entity11 is now sharing her story in an effort to help any other women who may be going through the same situation			1
wanting a family of your own is one of the most natural things in the word , but more and more women are now reaching middle age without giving birth			2
she said : ' i spent about 15 years in this baby bubble and i never once heard anyone who had been in my situation talk about it			2
' i think it 's because it 's just too scary , people do n't always want to listen that things do n't always work out , that life is n't fair			2
' it 's still a taboo			0
' but what i 'd like to get across is if you are in this situation , there are people who can help - it 's not the end of the world			2
' i do n't want to belittle what i went though because it broke my heart not being able to have a baby , but you can come out the other side of it and things do get better			0
' @entity11 was talking out as part of a @entity231 programme called a life without a child , which can now be listened to on @entity234 , which talks to three women about what it means to be childless			1
the show addresses the taboo of being a woman with no kids and the trauma and stress of years women go through to try and make that happen .			0
