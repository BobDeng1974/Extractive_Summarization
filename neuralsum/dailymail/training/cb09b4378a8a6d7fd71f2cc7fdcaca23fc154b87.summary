by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:58 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 08:01 est , 10 june 2013 naturists fear they will be forced to cover up under new laws designed to crack - down on yobs			2
it is claimed new measures designed to curb anti-social behaviour could be used by police and the courts to stop them stripping off in public			1
nudist beaches in particular could become a thing of the past if magistrates take a personal dislike to them , it is claimed			1
row : parks and beaches could be out of bounds for naturists under new laws aimed at tackling anti-social behaviour , nudist groups have warned the row centres on the @entity27 , which is debated in the @entity28 today			1
it includes power for the courts to grant an injunction against someone who ‘ has engaged in , or is threatening to engage in , anti-social behaviour ’			1
ministers say it could include not being in possession of a can of spray paint in a public place , not entering a particular area , or not being drunk in public			2
home secretary @entity43 has argued the changes will help to cut crime			2
' we are delivering on our pledges to give victims of antisocial behaviour a stronger voice , further cut crime and improve the relationship between the public and police , ' she said last month			2
home secretary @entity43 insist the new powers will help to cut crime but naturist groups claim the law has been so widely drawn that police officers and magistrates courts could ‘ abuse ’ their position to target people who choose not to wear clothes			1
@entity65 branded the legislation ‘ probably the most serious attack on the civil liberties of this country in decades ’			2
in a statement it warned the new laws would pose a ‘ major threat to @entity65 ’			0
it added : ‘ it is well - meaning , and seeks to tackle a serious social problem , but it is so open ended that it could be used and abused to prohibit or require just about anything			0
‘ if history teaches us anything it is that if a power can be abused then it will be abused			0
‘ we have absolutely no doubt that if it becomes law as currently worded then it will be used to prohibit naturism in a wide range of places			1
‘ beaches and gardens are a certainty and it may even include naturist events and clubs			0
’ under the new rule , an injunction could be granted if a person has ‘ engaged in conduct which is capable of causing nuisance or annoyance to any person ’			1
@entity102 , chair of the @entity103 , said the legislation would ‘ make it so much easier for people to say that naturists have caused distress , that being a naturist and being naked in an open environment is anti-social ’			0
‘ because of a lack of a definition for what is anti-social , police officers are going to be put into an impossible position , ’ he told @entity112			0
he added : ‘ the only way that they ’ll be able to decide what to do [ if a complaint is made ] is to use their own moral compass about nudity and that could be religious			0
’ a @entity127 spokesman said : ‘ we want to give the police and other agencies the means to protect victims more effectively , not penalise certain behaviours			0
‘ the “ nuisance and annoyance " test is clear and well - established in law , and it will ultimately be for the courts to decide whether it is proportionate to grant an injunction restricting an individual from acting in a certain way			1
’ the @entity142 is expected to clear its second reading in the @entity28 tonight .			0

courts will be able to impose injunction on anyone causing ' nuisance or annoyance '
naturism groups claim magistrates *opposed* to stripping off will use law against them
