discount supermarket @entity0 is under fire for failing to notify customers of credit card fees six months after it promised the corporate regulator it would			1
the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) took action against the supermarket company last year after an investigation revealed it did not disclose a 0.5 percent surcharge placed on transactions made using tap and go contactless payment systems in any of its stores			1
@entity7 also found that @entity0 failed to disclose the 0.5 percent surcharge it charges consumers paying by credit card in some of its stores			1
but @entity39 reports that @entity0 has not consistently disclosed the surcharge to customers and many were unaware about the additional fees			2
some stores still do not have signs at entrances and signs at the registers warning of the surcharge are in tiny print			0
a spokeswoman for the supermarket said @entity0 had carried out an audit last year to make sure appropriate signs were visible			2
' if for any reason an @entity0 store does not have the required signage , we will ensure that this is corrected immediately , ' she said			0
the @entity7 took action against @entity0 last year after an investigation revealed it did not disclose a 0.5 percent surcharge on transactions made using tap and go some stores still do not have signs at entrances and signs at the registers warning of the surcharge are in tiny print under the @entity73 , retailers that fail to adequately disclose surcharges , or create the impression that surcharges do not apply , may be considered ' misleading or deceptive '			1
@entity7 deputy chairman @entity74 said retailers needed to disclose credit card surcharges			1
' merchants need to be transparent about fees and charges where credit card surcharges apply so that consumers can consider using other payment methods without any additional costs , ' mr @entity74 said			2
' consumers should also be mindful that payments by contactless or ' tap and go ' cards are currently treated as credit card transactions , meaning that fees may apply where there are surcharges in place , even where they are using a debit card			2
' in @entity0 stores all credit card transactions and all tap and go payments attract the 0.5 percent surcharge , irrespective of whether customers use a debit or credit card			1
an @entity0 spokeswoman said it has always charged credit card surcharges to ' cover the costs associated with the service '			1
' @entity0 is aware there are high costs associated with accepting credit cards , ' she said			2
@entity0 told the regulator it would put up signs at the entrance of stores and at registers to notify shoppers of the surcharge , as well as have cashiers inform customers before payments were made ' however , rather than inflating prices across the board , to compensate for the credit card acceptance costs , @entity0 prefers customers to make the choice themselves			1
' @entity126 , spokesman for consumer group choice , said many shoppers were unclear about the charges that can come with using tap and go			0
' most people do n't realise that tap and go relates to credit so obviously if you 're using a credit facility surcharges can come with that , ' mr @entity126 said			0
' what we take issue with is whether the surcharge is at a reasonable level , and what we have seen is excessive surcharges going on			0
' the surcharge at @entity0 is not excessive , but i do n't think it 's great they 're charging a surcharge on a debit facility , so people 's savings accounts			0
' mr @entity151 said shoppers needed to ask about surcharges before using tap and go			0
' i think it 's always important to ask - as you 've seen with @entity0 , you might assume there is n't a surcharge because @entity159 and @entity160 do n't have one , ' mr @entity126 said			0
' if you 're going to use tap and go you should ask what the surcharge will be , then ask for a surcharge free option			0
