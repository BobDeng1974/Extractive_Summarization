by @entity0 for the @entity1 on a patch of hilly , barren scrubland in north - east @entity3 , kidnapped @entity7 journalist @entity6 was beheaded by an @entity9 jihadist with an @entity11 accent			1
a chilling video , broadcast online , offered virtually no clues as to the location except that the extremist was based in the town of @entity17			2
in an extraordinary piece of detective work , 35 - year - old @entity18 , who has investigated the @entity3 conflict , may have pinpointed the spot where the reporter was killed			1
mr @entity18 explains there are two breaks in the rocks visible here either side of mr @entity6 and his captor according to mr @entity18 ' analysis , this is the layout of the area in which mr @entity6 was killed the video showing the killing of mr @entity6 is believed to have been filmed somewhere near @entity17 but mr @entity18 , who blogs under the name @entity18 , is not working for the security services … he is a @entity36 - based citizen journalist who used just satellite imagery , traditional maps and evidence from the video to narrow down the place of death			1
even though mr @entity18 admits there is ‘ not a great deal of information ’ in the video he points out some information can be gleaned			2
the killing was filmed in what appears to be a hilly area , with barely any plants or grass , and in the distance there is green plain below the hills			0
shadows on the video suggest it was filmed in the morning , with the camera pointing northwards – suggesting the location was in the uplands south of @entity17			2
studying the video , the blogger surmised it was filmed on an area of raised ground , close to a dusty a track and leading to a break in the rocks , to the left of mr @entity6 as the camera looks at him			0
there is another small break in the rocks to the right			0
in the distance there appear to be no obvious structures beyond what may be trees or small individual buildings			0
trees at the top of this map correspond to the details spotted in the video filmed by mr @entity6 's captors these images show roads that help identify the location in the background of the video satellite map images appear to support mr @entity18 : they show a track entrance to the area , with a rock outcrop be partly covering the entryway , as it does in the video			1
based on that information it appears that this is the approximate positions of what is seen in the video			0
the blogger also notes that when the camera films from a certain location on the outcrop , trees are visible in the distance - a possible match to the trees on the road running to the north - west			2
no buildings can be seen			0
mr @entity18 said : ‘ having reviewed locations along the hills south of @entity17 this appears to be the only location which fits what little information is available in the video			1
‘ along the hills this appears to be the most isolated spot with any sort of road access , with most other areas with road access appearing to have structures that would be visible in the video			0
‘ based on all available information we can say that at the very minimum the @entity6 video was filmed in the hills south of @entity17 , and likely at the location shown above , supporting the claims that @entity17 is the possible location of the remaining hostages			1

citizen journalist may have pinpointed the location @entity7 journalist was killed
@entity18 used satellite imagery , maps and evidence from the video
roads , hills and trees spotted in the video helped identify the location
@entity156 concluded it *occurred* in the hills south of @entity3 city of @entity17
