work has started to demolish a former coastguard 's cottage which has been left just six inches from a chalk cliff edge following erosion caused by bad weather this winter			1
a five - strong team of demolition men started four weeks ' worth of work on the end - of - terrace property at @entity11 , near @entity12 , @entity13 , today			1
the privately owned cottage once formed a terrace of seven former coastguard properties built on the cliff overlooking the @entity18 between 1800 and 1820			1
preparations have begun to demolish this former coastguard 's cottage which has been left just six inches ( 15cm ) from a cliff edge following bad weather this winter the privately owned cottage once formed a terrace of seven former coastguard properties ( pictured in 1972 ) built on the cliff overlooking the @entity18 in the 1800s but , due to the pace of erosion , two cottages had to be demolished in 1994 and in the early 2000s - and now a third one is set to follow suit			1
engineer @entity31 , of @entity32 , said at least three metres of cliff has been lost along that section of @entity11 in the past three months			2
bad weather in february caused more than seven years ' worth of erosion to cliffs on the @entity13 coastline , which has resulted in thousands of tonnes of rock falling into the sea			1
and he said that the property which will eventually be left at the end of the terrace will only have up to ten years before it too could succumb to erosion			2
@entity48 , contracts director at @entity49 , which is carrying out the work , said : ‘ recent collapses to the cliff have brought it much closer than it was previously			2
‘ the house really did n't need to be brought down but because the erosion has been so quick , we have been brought in fairly quickly to carry this out			0
‘ today is a site set up			2
we need to get fencing up so that the public do n't get too close , and do more work to the interior of the building so we can get scaffolding built to carry out rendering to the cottage that is going to remain - number four			1

mr @entity48 added : ‘ to take a house down normally is a fairly simple process but , in this environment , we have to totally change our methodology			0
‘ most of the work will be carried out from large cherry pickers , so we do n't have to put anyone on the ground around the outside of the building , because the cliff could really go at any time			2
‘ on a daily basis we will be checking the cliff for any additional collapse that may happen			0
we will have to cut through the building so that we can carry out the protection work to number four			0
‘ once that 's done , we will strip the roof off by hand , bring all the walls down by hand and slowly , methodically work our way down from the top to the bottom			0
’ evidence of the effects of erosion are clearly visible at @entity11 , with a huge crack having opened up just yards from the cottages recent storms have caused the kind of damage that the @entity116 - which is responsible for this stretch of picturesque coastline - was expecting , but not for some years to come the organisation has warned that with more extreme weather predicted the rate of change on @entity123 's coastline will speed up mr @entity48 said it was not possible to allow the cottage to fall away into the sea naturally because it is attached to other properties and would pose a danger to beach - goers below			1

hard defences , such as sea walls , are unlikely to be the best solution to coping with the forces of nature on our coasts , the @entity116 has said , and more long - term planning is needed to minimise the impact of the changing climate			0
other sites affected by the winter storms have included : @entity175 in @entity176 ; important wildlife sites at @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 , @entity181 ; @entity183 national nature reserve in @entity184 ; and @entity185 , @entity186			0
@entity116 owns more than 740 miles ( 1,191km ) of coastline around @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity184 , around a tenth of the total coastline for the three countries			0
