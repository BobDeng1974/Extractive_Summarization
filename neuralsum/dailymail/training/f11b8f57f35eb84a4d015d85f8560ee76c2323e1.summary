by @entity0 follow @ @ samcunningham they say you need two hearts to play for him			2
they say that monday to friday he is hated by his squad but come match - day they love him			2
@entity10 has risen from a manager barely anyone in @entity13 had heard of 18 months ago to take charge of one of the biggest clubs in @entity17			1
appointed by @entity18 in may , he faces the biggest challenges of his relatively short managerial career : a chairman with an itchy trigger finger , fans with high expectations and a squad of disjointed , expensive stars			2
@entity37 ( @entity18 — jun 93 to @entity38 ) : could n’t replicate past success at the club and was sacked in his second season			2
@entity42 ( @entity43 — jun 08 to feb 09 ) : axed after a @entity45 slump in form			2
@entity47 ( @entity48 — jun 13 - ) : won the league title and @entity50 in his first season			2
@entity52 ( @entity53 - oct 13 - ) : dragged club from drop zone and led them to @entity50 final			2
@entity58 supporters were furious when their former chief executive @entity59 sacked local hero @entity60 and brought in this unknown @entity61 from @entity62			1
but he staved off relegation and a quarter of the way through last season the club stood third in the table			0
it was not down to luck			0
during last pre-season @entity10 often demanded triple training sessions from his players			1
they would train from 10am - midday , from 2pm - 4pm and from 6pm - 8pm			0
one club source said : ‘ the main change when he joined @entity58 was that the intensity was stepped up			0
’ @entity10 will arrive at the training ground at 7am and wo n’t be gone until 7pm at the earliest			1
during the season he lightens the load but is still unrelenting in his pursuit of fitness			0
in a typical week monday is a rest day , but then on tuesday and wednesday he expects hard training again , often with double and occasionally triple sessions			1
on thursday it is lighter training and on friday @entity10 does tactical work , looking specifically at the team ’s next opponents			1
dedication : @entity91 and the @entity58 team followed boss @entity10 over hot coals leading the way : @entity10 walks over hot coals at @entity62 he fitted each player with @entity96 to detail their movement in training and would use an @entity99 to view a wider angle of games being filmed			1
@entity103 striker @entity102 played for him at @entity62 and then @entity58			1
‘ he makes you work like a dog , ’ he said			0
‘ sometimes you feel like killing him , but it works			0
’ one criticism , however , is that he does not hide his preference for certain members of his squad			0
‘ he has a tendency to have favourite players , ’ said one source			1
‘ that worked ok at @entity58 because they were a growing team			0
but at @entity18 , where the players are more high - profile , that ’s dangerous			1
’ @entity10 ’s teams are energetic , constantly closing down their opponents			1
the players are like attack dogs set on the scent of the ball			1
he usually plays one up front with three attacking midfielders or forwards behind			0
in possession they adhere to a strict passing philosophy			0
at goal kicks the centre halves drop wide around the penalty area , the full backs push 40 yards up the pitch and one of the two central midfielders moves to the edge of the box , giving the goalkeeper options to pass everywhere			0
midfielder @entity139 said : ‘ it does feel like you need two hearts to play like that			0
’ @entity10 invests in youth , particularly young @entity146 players , something which attracted @entity148 to his appointment			1
at @entity58 he consistently played @entity150 , 19 , and gave first - team @entity36 debuts to defender @entity151 , 19 , striker @entity152 , 18 , and midfielder @entity153 , 19			0
giving youth a chance : @entity139 and @entity151 both got opportunites at @entity58 @entity58 ’s @entity156 flourished last season under @entity10			1
he netted 17 times , earned a first @entity13 cap and was on the verge of @entity163 ’s @entity162 squad until a knee injury ruled him out			0
‘ he brought the best out of me and gave me self - belief , ’ @entity156 said			0
‘ to work with him was brilliant , it was hard work but the lads loved it and we got results			2
‘ his tactical awareness gave you confidence , you wanted to go out for him because he ’s such a great guy			0
you can talk to him			0
the players respected him so much			2
’ at @entity58 they were prepared to walk over hot coals for him			0
@entity10 brought in motivational speaker @entity179			1
as the culmination of the session the @entity58 squad were told to walk over hot coals			0
@entity10 led by example and went first			1
the players all followed him			2
@entity185 wants belief from players getting down to work : @entity10 with his @entity18 squad during pre-season training making his mark : @entity10 speaks to his sqaud ahead of the new season but @entity18 chairman @entity148 has sacked eight managers in his 13 years at the club			1
why will @entity10 be any different ? the @entity61 shared a strong working relationship with @entity59			1
when the former @entity58 chief executive threatened to leave the club last summer , @entity10 vowed to follow him out the door			1
when the @entity201 - @entity200 resigned in january this year , @entity10 was prepared to honour his word			1
but , over a glass of wine , @entity59 persuaded him to stay			0
men in charge : @entity10 was brought to @entity13 by then @entity58 chairman @entity59 and now works for @entity148 at @entity18 one thing is very different for @entity10 in his new job			1
he will finally be speaking @entity146 in public , something he very rarely did at @entity58			0
but he always spoke to his players without any problem , and on saturday , when @entity18 open the new season away at @entity215 , we will find out whether the message got through .			2

@entity10 is known for working his players hard in training
@entity10 made players do triple training sessions during pre-season
at @entity62 he fitted each player with *gps* and followed their movements on an @entity99
