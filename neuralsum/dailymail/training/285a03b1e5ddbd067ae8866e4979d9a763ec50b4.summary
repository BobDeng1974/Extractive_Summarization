engineers have had to test @entity2 cars on a copy of a @entity5 road to see if the @entity7 vehicles are robust enough to survive motoring conditions here			1
the four - mile test track at the @entity11 centre in @entity13 cracks easily and is noisy to drive on			2
it has sharp turns like those found on many rural highways and can recreate the sub-zero temperatures found in winter , the @entity15 website reported			0
a genuine @entity5 pothole : @entity7 car maker @entity2 has had to build a special test facility to recreate the terrible conditions on @entity5 roads , like this one in the @entity25 area of @entity26 for added realism , it even has @entity5 road signs and roundabouts			1
@entity2 said the track was necessary because @entity5 roads absorb more water than the harder surfaces used in continental @entity33			2
when this water freezes , it expands and cracks road surfaces , resulting in the classic @entity37 pothole			1
@entity39 , from the @entity38 , described the development as a ‘ sad indictment ’ of the @entity5 road system			0
he said : ‘ unfortunately , it seems potholes are here to stay , so car manufacturers are right to invest in trying to prepare cars for the conditions here			0
’ a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ the road surfaces in continental @entity33 , especially in the @entity50 , are paved with hard material that does not absorb water			0
‘ this is because , in severe winter , absorbed water in the material may freeze , turn into ice and destruct the roads			0
round and round : the company 's test track in @entity13 also includes unique features of @entity5 roads like roundabouts , which rarely appear along the highways of other countries ‘ @entity37 does not tend to suffer with this severe winter , and so the surface is made with softer materials with many pores to absorb rain to prevent a slippery surface			1
‘ as a result , @entity5 roads have a rougher surface , which creates more road noise than other @entity33 roads			0
‘ what @entity2 wanted to replicate in @entity11 was this type of road surface			0
’ poor road surfaces have often been blamed for hefty repair bills and last year local councils in @entity5 had to pay out nearly £ 23million in compensation to drivers whose cars have been damaged by potholes			2
but , @entity2 says , the main reason for building their four - and - a - quarter mile track - which is so realistic it even includes @entity5 road signs - is to mimic the soft road surfaces of @entity5 roads			1
@entity95 , @entity96 : @entity7 roads are too good to mimic driving conditions in the @entity5 , @entity2 has said			1

@entity7 roads are too good to mimic @entity5 driving conditions
@entity5 road surfaces are more absorbent , leading to cracks when water freezes
test track also includes @entity5 - style roundabouts and road signs
