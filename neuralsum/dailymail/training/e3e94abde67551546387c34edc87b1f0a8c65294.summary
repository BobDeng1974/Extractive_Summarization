many couples jet off on holiday to revive the romance in their relationships but it appears time away together may do more harm than good			2
new research suggests that a third of women end up fancying their partner less after a trip abroad			0
and it appears the main turn - offs are peeling skin from a nasty sunburn , heat stroke and a relationship ’s biggest killer : plain old boredom			1
new research suggests that a third of women end up fancying their partner less after a trip abroad too much booze : a quarter of respondents complained that their man drank too much during their holiday too much sun : the main turn - offs are sunburnt skin , heat stroke and boredom the findings are based on a survey commissioned by online travel agent @entity33 , which polled 2,364 @entity36 women who had been on holiday with their partner in the last year			1
thirty - two per cent revealed that they were ‘ less attracted ’ to their partner once they returned to the @entity36			1
while the effects of the sun played some part , for 35 per cent it was simply spending too much time together that put them off			0
another quarter ( 26 per cent ) said their man drank too much and one in five ( 19 per cent ) was upset because their partner was ogling other women			0
sneaking a peek : one in five ( 19 per cent ) was upset because their partner was ogling other women going in different direction : thirty - five per cent said they spent too much time with their partner nearly a quarter ( 23 per cent ) of all respondents admitted they would rather go on a girls ’ trip than a getaway with their partner while one in six would even prefer a holiday with family members			1
but it ’s not all bad news for men out there as 41 per cent of women said they were keener on their partner after a holiday in the sun. most said it was because their men took better care of themselves , were nicer to be around and had shed some pounds to look good on the beach			2
boredom : one in six women admitted they would prefer a holiday with family members over their partner @entity82 , managing director of @entity33 , said : ‘ if you ’ve never been on holiday with a partner before it can be quite daunting known that you ’re going to be with them 24/7 , especially if you are n’t used to living together			2
‘ people are generally more relaxed on holiday , so bad habits can emerge which may be off - putting , but people should just enjoy being together and not having anything to worry about for a week or two			0
’ he added : ‘ if , by the end of the holiday , you ’re feeling more unsure about your partner than when you set off , it ’s probably time to call it a day			0
