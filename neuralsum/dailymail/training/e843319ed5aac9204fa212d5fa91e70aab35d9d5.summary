by @entity0 published : 22:08 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 03:56 est , 1 may 2013 newly discovered fossils have given fresh insights into how the predecessors of dinosaurs developed 10million years after most of life was wiped out in @entity7 's largest ever extinction			2
seven expeditions to @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 have uncovered some of the earliest fossils of pre-dinosaur creatures ever found			1
they shed new light on how herbivore species - that eventually gave rise to dinosaurs - were able to compete after ancient species were decimated in a mass extinction 252million years ago			1
@entity21 was once a dominant herbivore but was decimated in the mass extinction 252million years ago			2
new research shows the catastrophe allowed other herbivores to compete and eventually gave rise to dinosaurs @entity28 of the @entity29 and @entity30 of the @entity31 cast a large skull of a @entity33 in @entity10 snapshots taken of life before and after catastrophic event show how the dispersal and destruction of so many species allowed others - including the ancestors of the first dinosaurs - to thrive			1
up to 96 per cent of all marine life and 70 per cent of land animals were killed in the mass extinction , known as @entity46			1
the stars on this paleogeographic map of southern @entity49 indicate the five areas were the most @entity51 and @entity52 fossils are found it included the only known extinction of insects			0
palaeontologists from the @entity58 say the newly discovered fossils reveal a lineage of animals thought to have led to dinosaurs in @entity9 and @entity10			1
before the mass extinction creatures such as the pig - sized @entity21 - a dominant plant - eating species - thrived across southern @entity49 - the name given to the landmass in which all the world 's continents were once joined together			1
@entity21 disappeared after the extinction and newly emerging herbivores were able to compete			0
paleontologist @entity72 said : ' after the extinction animals were n't as uniformly and widely distributed as before			0
we had to go looking in some fairly unorthodox places			0
' another creature called an archosaur lived in @entity9 and @entity10 but were not distributed across southern @entity49 , as had been the pattern for four - legged animals before the extinction			1
after the ancient extinction , some animals , like @entity82 , pictured , were restricted in where they lived palaeontologists from the @entity58 found fossilized remains of a new species of the @entity82 dinosaur in the @entity89 of @entity9 @entity90 , whose living relatives are birds and crocodilians , are of interest to scientists because it is thought that they led the first dinosaurs			1
animals like @entity82 , a dinosaur - like animal , and @entity100 , a dog - sized creature with a five - foot - long tail , which could be the earliest dinosaur , are believed to have evolved from them			0
professor @entity72 said : ' early archosaurs being found mainly in @entity9 is an example of how fragmented animal communities became after the extinction			2
' as well as travel to southern @entity109 and @entity11 , researchers combed through existing fossil collections in museums			2
@entity112 , programme director in @entity114 's @entity113 , said : ' these scientists have identified an outcome of mass extinctions - that species ecologically marginalized before the extinction may be " freed up " to experience evolutionary bursts then dominate after the extinction			0
' the researchers created two ' snapshots ' of four - legged animals on @entity7 about five million years before , and about 10 million years after the mass extinction event			1
@entity30 of the @entity31 holds a fossil skeleton of @entity127 collected during an expedition to @entity11 analysis of the findings showed that before the extinction , 35 per cent of four - legged species were found in two or more of the five areas studied and some stretched for 1,600 miles			2
ten million years after the extinction , just seven per cent of species were found in two or more regions			0
the research began in the early 2000s when expeditions were organised to sites in @entity9 that had not been visited since the 1960s and in @entity10 where there had been little work since the 1980s			1
two expeditions to @entity11 provided additional finds , as did efforts to look at museum fossils that had not been fully documented or named			0
the fossils turned out to hold a treasure trove of information , the scientists say , on life some 250 million years ago			0
the paper of the findings that will be published in the journal @entity156 .			0

seven fossil collection expeditions made to @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11
palaeontologists say they reveal how life continued after the extinction event
research shows how mass extinction allowed other species to compete
