by @entity0 published : 17:54 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 02:51 est , 13 december 2012 @entity2 football will introduce quotas for referees and coaches as part of an unprecedented campaign to tackle racism			1
the plan will be adopted early in the new year and include the demand that at least 10 per cent of entry level officials and coaches throughout the game are from ethnic minorities			1
there will also be moves to increase the involvement of women , ethnic minorities and disabled people in all forms of football , while @entity22 role models will be sought to encourage @entity22 children to play the game			1
confidential hotlines will be set up for players to report any form of bullying and discrimination , and fans will be able to text , email or maybe even tweet their complaints about any form of racism			2
race disgrace : @entity36 ( covering mouth ) was banned for abusing @entity38 the @entity39 will support the @entity41 proposal of a minimum five - game ban for racist abuse			1
@entity39 chief executive @entity44 said : ‘ we want to illustrate the seriousness of our approach to this issue			0
’ in addition , the latest video and audio technology will be used to identify supporters guilty of racist gestures or chanting at matches			1
the far - reaching plan comes after a period in which football has been scarred by the racist behaviour of @entity36 and @entity59 , and by the false accusation of racial abuse levelled at referee @entity62			1
the extent of the fight against racism can be revealed by @entity66 , who have seen the @entity41 ’s 92 - point @entity68 and @entity69			2
@entity41 chairman @entity70 has also given his personal guarantee in a letter to culture secretary @entity73 , copied to prime minister @entity74 , that all the recommendations will be carried out once they have been rubber - stamped by football ’s stakeholders			1
the anti-racism education process being introduced will not just involve cultural lessons for overseas players and managers coming to @entity2			1
all sections of the game , including match stewards , will be given advice on how best to combat discrimination and the procedures to follow when it happens			2
the @entity41 will also establish an @entity89 to provide guidance on all equality matters and monitor the implementation of the plan			0
flashpoint : @entity59 ( left ) was in an ugly clash with @entity96 last season the document has been distributed to all @entity100 clubs , who will be expected to sign the charter for action against homophobia and transphobia launched by the government last year			0
contracts with players and managers will have a mandatory reference to behaving in an inclusive and non-discriminatory manner			2
a timetable has been set out as far ahead as the 2017 - 18 season as to when the 92 points will be implemented			0
they start this month with the football organisations publicising the roles and responsibilities of each body — @entity41 , @entity121 , @entity122 , clubs , @entity124 , @entity39 and @entity125 — in promoting inclusion and dealing with discrimination in football			1
also beginning immediately is the @entity41 mandate that the proportion of ethnic minority coaches starting at the lowest level of qualification does not fall below 10 per cent			1
and by season 2015 - 16 : ‘ the @entity41 in conjunction with @entity139 will ensure that 10 per cent of the referee workforce is from @entity136 , @entity22 and minority ethnic communities , which is reflective of national demographics			1
’ @entity140 shrift : @entity142 's @entity141 refuses to wear a kick it out top the proposals are the @entity41 ’s response to the prime minister calling for the game to take tougher action after an anti-racism - in - football summit last february			1
@entity70 is making the fight against racism his personal @entity41 legacy before he stands down next may			0
in his letter to @entity73 he writes : ‘ let me give you my own personal reassurance that this is an issue at the very top of my agenda			0
‘ it is one that i know we are all determined to address both speedily and collaboratively subject to the approvals processes of our respective organisations			0
‘ there is no doubt that recent events have brought into sharp relief the impact that race and other forms of discrimination can still have on the game			0
incidents involving high - profile players cast a shadow over the sport and can undermine much of the collective good work achieved			2
‘ despite the substantial progress @entity2 football has made in this area over many years we fully recognise that the work to eliminate discrimination based on race , ethnic origin , colour and nationality is still not complete			0
’ official inquiry : the @entity41 want more non-white referees to follow @entity190 @entity70 was referring to the @entity36 , @entity59 and @entity192 cases and the @entity41 plan seeks to prevent any repetition			1
the hotline strategy follows @entity197 ’ complaints about some black players not trusting the authorities to fight racism			2
to counter that lack of faith in the authorities , the planned support structure will ‘ ensure those who wish to report incidents of discrimination or bullying within the game , whether trainees , players , coaches , managers , other employees or fans , can do so in confidence and receive the support they may require ’			1
ironically @entity70 also puts on record his strong support for anti-racism group @entity219 , whose chairman @entity220 has threatened to quit the @entity221 in protest at their ‘ mealy - mouthed ’ response to the @entity36 and @entity59 issues			0
the recommendations may be tweaked after feedback from stakeholders			0
but they are broadly expected to be introduced following club meetings next february			0
it is envisaged that the final version will be presented in a ‘ more user friendly and punchy format ’			0
crackdown : @entity235 banned this supporter for making a gesture at @entity239 's @entity238 other key proposals include : the @entity41 are not just attempting to eradicate racism in their grand plan			2
the commitment is to ‘ promote inclusion and eliminate discrimination whether by reason of race , nationality , ethnic origin , colour , age , gender , gender reassignment , sexual orientation , marital status , religion or belief , ability or disability ’ .			0
