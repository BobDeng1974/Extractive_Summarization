by @entity1 reporter published : 19:58 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 19:58 est , 9 july 2013 low level exposure to traffic fumes is enough to raise the risk of lung cancer , scientists reported yesterday			1
air pollution may even have to be added to smoking as a recognised cause of the disease , it is claimed			0
lung cancer is the biggest cancer killer in the @entity12 , claiming almost 35,000 lives in 2010			1
in the same year , 42,000 @entity12 were diagnosed with the disease			1
danger : new research suggests even low exposure to car fumes could increase the risk of lung cancer an estimated 86 % of cases are believed to be a direct result of smoking			1
other potential triggers include exposure to natural radioactive gas from the ground and toxic substances in the work place , such as asbestos			2
the new research , reported in the journal @entity32 , analysed pooled information from 17 studies in nine @entity36 countries			0
in total , the data covered almost 313,000 individuals			0
air pollution levels were estimated at people ’s home addresses and cancer diagnosis rates obtained from national and local registries			2
over an average 13 year follow - up period , 2,095 study participants developed lung cancer			1
people ’s chances of having the disease rose with greater exposure to small sooty particles generated by diesel exhausts which are known to lodge in the lungs			1
two size grades of particle were studied , tiny pm 2.5s and somewhat larger @entity57			0
for every density increase in @entity57 of 10 micrograms per cubic metre of air , the risk of lung cancer rose by 22 %			1
for @entity64 , every five microgram per metre cubed increase led to an 18 % increase in risk			2
deadly : an estimated 86 per cent of lung cancer cases are thought to be caused by smoking the trend was seen below the air quality limits set by the @entity71 of 40 micrograms per cubic metre for @entity57 and 25 micrograms for @entity73 , according to the study authors			1
lead scientists dr @entity76 , from the @entity77 , said : ' we found no threshold below which there was no risk			2
the results showed a picture that ‘ the more the worse , the less the better ’			0
' traffic pollution was mostly linked to adenocarcinoma lung cancer , the only form of the disease to affect significant numbers of non-smokers			1
commenting in the journal , @entity91 expert dr @entity90 from @entity92 wrote : ' at this stage , we might have to add air pollution , even at current concentrations , to the list of causes of lung cancer and recognise that air pollution has large effects on public health			1
' a second study published in a sister journal , @entity32 , links air pollution with a higher chance of heart failure patients being hospitalised			0
researchers combined data from 35 studies and estimated that a modest reduction in fine particulate pollution levels could prevent 8,000 heart failure hospitalisations each year in the @entity114			0
dr @entity115 , from the @entity116 , who co-led the @entity118 - funded study said : ' we already know that air pollution is associated with an increased risk of having a heart attack			0
our study suggests that air pollution also affects patients with heart failure			0
' heart failure occurs when the heart is too weak to pump blood efficiently round the body			0
it affects more than 750,000 people in the @entity12 .			2

even low level exposure can increase risk of illness
lung cancer is the biggest cancer killer in the @entity12
