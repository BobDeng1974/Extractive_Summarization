by @entity0 blood from a murder scene will be used to determine if a convicted killer is the father of his victim ’s children			1
in the bizarre case , the murderer , who is serving a life sentence for stabbing his girlfriend to death at their @entity11 home , wants to keep in touch with her two young children			1
he is not named on their birth certificates and refuses to take a paternity test , insisting he ‘ knows best ’ and that he fathered them			1
composite of dna strands and a couple in the background ( picture posed by models ) so social workers who are looking after the children made the highly unusual request to the @entity31 for permission to use forensic material from the crime scene			2
they want the issue resolved either way for the sake of the children			2
because the knifeman is believed to have cut his own wrists while attacking the woman , blood likely to be his own was found in the house and stored by @entity44			0
by comparing a copy of the dna profile of this blood with that taken from the two children , lawyers for the local authority say they can establish if he was their father			2
none of those involved can be named in order to protect the children ’s identities			1
both the @entity57 and the @entity58 opposed the application , as did lawyers for the killer			0
the authorities said that the highly sensitive database of criminals ’ genetic material was not meant to be used to resolve family disputes , and would therefore open the ‘ floodgates ’ to other requests for samples			0
there are also strict rules about the use of evidence seized by police , while individuals – even convicted killers – have the right to keep their medical data private			0
but sir @entity78 , the president of the @entity31 , overruled their concerns and allowed copies of the murder scene dna profiles to be compared with those of the children			0
he argued that the move was justified in this case because the children had the right to know if the man who killed their mother was indeed their father			0
sir @entity78 said : ‘ how can therapy or counselling be arranged , how is the children ’s psychological integrity to be preserved , if the paternity issue is not resolved ? ‘ in these circumstances the balance , in my judgment , comes down in favour of the children			1
