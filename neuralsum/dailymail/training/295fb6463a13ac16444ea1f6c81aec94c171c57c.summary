@entity0 has apologised to @entity2 defender @entity1 for the kick that saw the @entity4 sent - off for the ninth time in his career on saturday			1
the three - time @entity8 kicked out in frustration at @entity1 in the 83rd minute but he was bailed out by @entity11 's last - gasp penalty			1
afterwards he tweeted : ' i apologise to everyone and especially edimar for my thoughtless action in today 's game			0
' @entity0 lashes out at @entity2 's @entity16 as the frustration begins to boil over @entity0 aims a personalised boot in the direction of @entity1 's shin in the lead up to his red card @entity0 appears to protest his innocence as @entity24 clutches his face on the floor ... but @entity16 pushes the @entity4 referee @entity27 had little choice but to show @entity0 a straight red card following the incidents it was a miserable afternoon for @entity0 in which he was overshadowed by former @entity34 winger @entity33 for much of the game			1
his frustration got the better of him in the second half but when he was given his marching orders for kicking @entity1 and striking @entity16 it meant @entity11 was allowed to take both free - kicks and penalties			1
he won a spot - kick with a free - kick that was handled by @entity44 - who was also subsequently sent off - and he stepped up in @entity0 ’s place to score from the spot			1
@entity0 could face a three - match ban for violent conduct but @entity11 looks more than capable of picking up the baton			1
the former @entity52 winger ended up deciding the match but for a long time it seemed another winger might grab the headlines			0
@entity11 comforts @entity0 after @entity58 's talisman was sent off for his attack @entity2 : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity16 , @entity24 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity33 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 ( @entity68 80 )			1

subs not used : @entity90 , @entity27 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity87 goals : @entity88 27 , @entity11 89 ( pen ) booked : @entity79 , @entity81 , @entity84 sent off : ronaldo ref : @entity27 att : 21,822 it was five years ago that sir @entity97 signed 19 - year - old @entity33 from @entity98 in @entity4 without having seen play			1
many hoped he would be the next @entity0 signed three years earlier from sporting aged 18 but beyond nationality and position there turned out to be few similarities			0
@entity33 played seven games for @entity34 and four for @entity106 on loan before heading back to @entity108 to rebuld his career on loan first at @entity111 and then at @entity112			1
it looked as if he ’d bounced back when he signed permanently for @entity114 in the summer but after one appearance he was sent out on loan again , this time to @entity2 who were 14th in @entity118 going into this weekend ’s fixtures			0
he was back on the same pitch as @entity0 and in the battle of the former @entity34 wingers @entity33 was winning hands down at the end of the first half			1
he crucially won the spot - kick that gave @entity2 the lead			2
his shot from the right smashed against @entity81 and referee @entity27 gave a penalty and booked the @entity58 defender			2
after a slow , straight run - up @entity131 beat @entity78 for his sixth goal of the season			0
@entity33 had only just started , however			0
he raced away down the @entity2 right and crossed for @entity136 but his centre was just behind the @entity139 striker			2
he burned up @entity82 again only to his time over-hit his cross , sending it behind the goal			0
the quality of the final ball left a lot to be desired but the threat was most definitely there with a pace , power and purpose missing in most of @entity58 ’s lethargic attacking play			0
@entity33 ’s next effort was a shot that shaved @entity78 ’ far post and he then tried his luck from distance with the keeper this time making the save			0
@entity0 finally responded with a free - kick at the other end but the set - piece was high and wild never troubling @entity163 in the home side ’s goal			1
as players from both teams prepare for a set piece , @entity0 has other , more violent , ideas on his mind the @entity172 winner punches @entity16 during the league match against @entity2 on saturday afternoon and @entity0 later hit @entity16 again , the @entity4 forward would eventually get sent off the @entity108 captain kicks @entity1 in the shin during the second half against @entity2 @entity24 lies on the ground after the attack while @entity58 star @entity0 complains @entity0 appeared to shrug his shoulders and smirk after the remarkable incident that saw him get sent off @entity58 defender @entity81 argues with the @entity2 players after @entity0 is shown the red card supporters at the ground take pictures as @entity0 heads back to the dressing room behind @entity188 the former @entity52 winger celebrates after scoring a late penalty to claim the win for the @entity193 champions @entity88 equalised for @entity58 after he latched on to @entity11 's flick from a corner @entity0 high - fives the @entity197 striker as he celebrates scoring his goal ronaldo lines up for a free kick during the first half at the @entity202 when @entity58 finally got back into the game it was the other two parts of their front - three that produced the goal			1
@entity88 turning in @entity209 's corner after @entity11 had flicked the kick on			2
there was no sign of any @entity2 players looking for shirt swaps when the half - time whistle went			2
much had been made before the game of striker @entity217 admitting – like @entity219 ’s players – that @entity2 would have to pay to replace any shirts they swapped with @entity58			2
the home side had shown the visitors no deference in the first half			0
@entity58 had not played at @entity2 ’s stadium in 43 years but @entity58 ’s record here has never been great , losing one and drawing four of the eight games played			0
now they were at 1 - 1 at half time struggling to look anything like league leaders			0
it had been such a trying first half that @entity188 had finished it arguing with the fourth official			0
he sent the same players out for the second half but there was no real change in the pattern of the game and @entity33 continued his one man show with the winger going on another mazy run only to disappoint with a weak shot			0
@entity0 had the chance to respond from another free - kick at the other end but again his range was off			1
@entity249 gave @entity2 a shock early lead as he converted a penalty after @entity81 ' handball @entity11 is held off by @entity1 as the @entity255 winger tries to make an impact on the game @entity2 defender @entity258 competes for the ball with @entity260 ace @entity209 on minute 68 @entity2 should have taken the lead when @entity80 dithered with a header back to @entity78 that @entity136 intercepted and headed over the goalkeeper			1
@entity264 seemed to standstill in the @entity266 as the ball looped goalwards only to come back off the bar			0
with the clock ticking down @entity0 stung @entity163 ’ hands from distance with a long shot and he then saved a @entity88 shot from the edge of the area			2
@entity81 headed the resulting corner over the bar as @entity0 swung wildly at @entity277 and was lucky the referee never saw the swipe			2
when he did it again moments later everyone saw it			0
another corner came over from the right and he caught @entity16 again and was shown a straight red			1
it was not the last red of the match though			0
@entity65 was sent off for a second yellow when he handballed @entity11 ’s free - kick and , in @entity0 ’s absence , the @entity289 scored from the spot to give @entity58 the points .			1

@entity0 was shown a straight red card in the 83rd minute for striking @entity16
the @entity4 superstar could face a three - match ban for his actions
@entity249 put the hosts ahead in the third minute from the spot after @entity81 handballed
@entity88 levelled matters *midway* through the first half a flick on from @entity11
@entity11 benefited from @entity0 's red with @entity289 taking free - kicks and an 89th minute penalty , which he converted
former @entity34 striker @entity33 played for @entity2 and *outshone* his former team - mate ronaldo
