odds on the second royal baby being called @entity2 have been slashed , following the success of @entity4 at @entity5 , the @entity7 ' close friend @entity9 's brother or sister could be called @entity2 - after the jockey that helped the @entity13 and @entity7 rekindle their romance			1
bookmakers have slashed odds on the name @entity2 - which could be used for @entity18 or @entity19 - being chosen for the name of the second royal baby			1
it follows the success of part - time jockey and the @entity7 's close friend @entity4 at @entity5 this weekend			1
the 33 - year - old amateur jockey was once dubbed ' the @entity27 ' after he helped the couple rekindle their romance during their brief split in 2007			1
the @entity13 and @entity7 have publicly insisted that even they do not know what sex their second child will be			1
@entity34 confirmed they received a recent flurry of bets following mr @entity38 's high - profile win on @entity39 on friday in @entity5 's @entity40 - prompting their odds to tumble from 66/1 to 20/1			1
@entity42 of @entity34 said : ' with @entity4 's close links to the @entity45 it seems punters are putting two and two together and coming up with @entity2 as their answer for the baby 's name			1
' @entity50 , from bookmakers @entity51 , confirmed they too have had no choice but reduce their odds on ' @entity2 ' in recent days because of the popularity of the name			2
he explained : ' we have slashed his odds from 66/1 to 40/1 ' given how close the @entity7 is to @entity4 we are also seeing money for @entity2 or @entity18 at 150/1 and @entity19 at 200/1 to be their second baby 's name			1
the baby will be the @entity69 's fifth great - grandchild			2
@entity70 is still the favourite at 3/1 followed closely by @entity72 and @entity73 at 5/1 and 6/1 respectively , according to @entity34 on sunday afternoon			0
at the moment odds have been slashed for female names , because of widespread speculation that the @entity7 will give birth to a sister for @entity9			2
@entity79 of @entity80 is expected to give birth later this month , with a rumoured due date of april 25 mr @entity4 , pictured in 2014 , rode to success at @entity5 on friday and in the @entity83 mr @entity4 , who has been a close confidante of the @entity7 for years , rode @entity84 to 15th place in yesterday 's @entity83			1
in 2011 he was invited to the couple 's @entity87 wedding			0
and in 2012 mr @entity4 - whose relatives include @entity90 founder , the 3rd @entity91 - made the @entity13 guest of honour at his nuptials to party - organiser @entity94			0
mr @entity4 , a part - time jump - jockey and healthcare businessman , won the @entity98 in 2010 on ' @entity99 ' the royal baby is expected to arrive later this month			1
there is speculation the @entity104 ' second born might arrive on the @entity105 on april 21 or even the @entity13 and @entity7 ' fourth wedding anniversary on april 29			2
other reports suggest the due date could be april 25			0
@entity79 of @entity80 is to return to the @entity110 wing at @entity111 in @entity112 to give birth			0
as she did with @entity9 ( pictured ) that date would tally with the fact that the @entity13 ' final public engagements before she gives birth were carried out on march 27 in @entity112 , suggesting late april is more likely than mid-april			0
the @entity13 ' second pregnancy was announced on september 8 when she was thought to be just six weeks pregnant			0
she has been staying at the couple 's new country home in @entity123 , @entity124			0
