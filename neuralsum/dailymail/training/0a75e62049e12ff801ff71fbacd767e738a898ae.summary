by @entity1 reporter published : 14:19 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 02:41 est , 30 october 2012 @entity2 : leader @entity3 has said the @entity5 drone was manufactured in @entity6 and assembled in @entity7 @entity6 yesterday claimed to have images of sensitive @entity10 military bases taken by a drone that was launched by @entity7 ’s @entity2 movement earlier this month			1
the announcement by senior @entity6 mp @entity14 gave no details about the photos - other than calling the @entity10 bases “ forbidden sites ” - but it suggested @entity6 drones have the ability to transmit data while in flight			1
it also appeared aimed at warning @entity10 about the options for retaliation for any possible strikes on @entity6 nuclear sites			1
@entity14 , also was quoted as saying that the @entity6 - backed @entity2 possesses more sophisticated @entity6 - made drones than the one that took the pictures and was shot down by the @entity10 military , including some that could carry weapons			1
' these drones transmit the pictures online , ' @entity14 told the semi-official @entity38 news agency			0
' the pictures of forbidden sites taken and transmitted by this drone are now in our possession			0
' the mp , who heads the parliament ’s defence committee , said @entity2 is “ definitely ” equipped with more sophisticated drones , but gave no further details			0
a senior @entity10 military official in @entity10 ’s northern command said he did not believe the drone possessed a camera , though he noted an @entity10 investigation is continuing			2
he spoke on condition of anonymity under military guidelines			0
@entity2 ' wo n’t announce it as long as it does n’t see the need to do so ... that ’s why we say we will respond to @entity10 inside ( its ) territory , should it take any action against us , ' said @entity14 , a former commander of the powerful @entity61			2
@entity6 has claimed that @entity6 - made surveillance drones have made dozens of apparently undetected flights into @entity10 airspace from @entity7 in recent years			1
@entity10 has rejected the account			1
@entity6 ’s defence minister @entity66 also claimed on sunday that @entity67 has drones far more advanced than the @entity70 unmanned aircraft launched by @entity2 , saying it was not the ' latest @entity6 technology , definitely			1
' he did not elaborate			0
long range : the @entity76 drone nearly doubles the range of previous drones produced by @entity6 technicians @entity2 leader sheik @entity3 has said the @entity5 drone was manufactured in @entity6 and assembled in @entity7			2
@entity6 routinely announces technological breakthroughs in its defence programme			0
last month it claimed to have started producing a long - range missile - carrying drone with a range of 1,250 miles			0
the @entity76 - 129 , or witness - 129 , covers much of the @entity88 including @entity10 and nearly doubles the range of previous drones produced by @entity6 technicians , who have often relied on reverse engineering military hardware with the country under @entity92 embargo			1
but it is unclear whether the new drone contains any elements of an unmanned @entity97 aircraft that went down in eastern @entity6 last year			0
@entity6 said it has recovered data from the @entity99 and claimed it was building its own replica			0
@entity6 ’s claims are impossible to independently confirm because the country ’s arsenal is not open to widespread international inspection with multinational war games or other co-operation .			2
