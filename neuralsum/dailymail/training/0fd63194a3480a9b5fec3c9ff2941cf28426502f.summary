by @entity0 published : 17:56 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 12:37 est , 7 december 2012 eleven years after their adoptive father was bludgeoned to death by their mother 's lover in their @entity8 mansion , the @entity2 twins have revealed the guilt they endured following his murder			1
in their first interview , @entity11 and @entity2 , now 22 , spoke out about how their mother had turned them against their father before his death , as she used them as pawns in her bitter divorce battle			1
and the manipulation was so successful that @entity11 was left carrying the guilt ' for years ' over her final scathing words to her father before he was murdered in october 2001 , when she was just 11			1
' it 's hard to know that the last thing you said before your dad died was that you hated him , ' @entity11 told @entity26			2
struggle : @entity11 and @entity2 speak with @entity26 about their adopted father 's murder battle : they spoke about how their mother turned them against their father before his murder in 2001 @entity38 and @entity39 had the picture perfect family after they adopted the twins as toddlers from a @entity45 orphanage , but after 17 years of marriage , the relationship began to crumble			1
following their separation , as @entity39 fought for half of his $ 80 million fortune , things turned ugly			0
@entity2 explained to @entity26 : ' there were times if we were n't awful to our father or spying on him , or going through his drawers , mom would be really awful to us back home			1
' @entity11 added : ' she just hated the fact that we loved our father , that we loved a man she did n't love anymore			0
' picture perfect : @entity38 and @entity39 adopted the children from a @entity45 orphanage as toddlers lavish : they still own the mansion in @entity69 where their father was found dead instead , their mother encouraged they love her boyfriend , an electrician from @entity75 named @entity76 , who divorced his own wife three months after their father 's death - and the man eventually convicted of the murder			1
' to have somebody in our life who was more concrete , more permanent , was great , ' @entity11 said			2
' when our mom was telling us ... this is the man you should love , it messed with our minds			0
' the twins , who have now made a documentary about their lives , were at their father 's house in @entity96 when the 52 - year - old was bludgeoned to death in the bedroom of his @entity8 home			1
their aunt told them that their father had been killed , and their mother later added that he ' had killed himself with pills of some sort ' , @entity2 told @entity26			1
' everything was so crazy that for the longest time i thought he was n't even dead , ' @entity11 said			0
' i thought he faked his own death			0
' divided : the couple separated and were locked in a bitter custody battle at the time of @entity2 's death missed : @entity11 said her mother turned them against her father , which she regretted for years after his death scene : in a new documentary about their lives , @entity2 stands in the room where his father was killed the children were left without parents for a second time when @entity39 was diagnosed with breast cancer and died in august 2003			1
the children went to live with their aunt in @entity127			0
@entity76 , who had been battling for a part of the fortune left by his late wife , was eventually arrested in march 2004 and was found guilty of murder			1
he has maintained that @entity39 hired a hit man to kill her husband			0
he will not be eligible for parole until 2031			0
but the twins admit they were not convinced he was a killer until he was convicted			1
' i still had doubts up until that point , ' @entity11 said			0
' i was so convinced he was innocent			0
i do n't know what he did to my mind			0
both @entity11 and @entity2 are now certain he was to blame , and say they choose to believe their mother was not a part of their father 's death			1
killer : @entity152 was arrested for the murder in 2004 and will not be eligible for parole until 2031			2
he married @entity39 three months after the death of her husband despite enduring such tragedy before they were teenagers , the twins pulled through			2
' we had each other so that was one thing , ' @entity2 said			1
' it was not easy			0
' @entity2 eventually moved to @entity163 and started a film production company while @entity11 managed a band in @entity166 - but came back together to film the documentary for closure			1
the twins , who inherited $ 1 million each after taxes and attorneys ' fees , also decided to use the opportunity of the documentary to find their biological family in the @entity45			1
searching through documents at the mansion , they find papers leading them to the orphanage from where they were adopted as malnourished children			2
they learn that they were the result of a one - night tryst between their mother and a soldier			0
the government then took them from their mother as she struggled with alcoholism and mental problems			0
thankful : @entity2 and @entity195 , 22 , have made a documentary revealing the torment they suffered after the murder of their father by their mother 's lover in 2001 - but said the family saved them old life : in the film , they return to the @entity45 orphanage and say they 'd have died if they were not adopted she was also a prostitute , who begged for money on the streets to buy alcohol			1
she died in 2004 and left behind a total of eight children , some of whom went to the same orphanage as the twins			2
the documentary shows them meeting their three half siblings and speaking to another brother on the phone in @entity225			2
despite being adopted into a life of bitter custody disputes and murderous affairs , they are thankful to the @entity229 for taking them in - otherwise they would have died in the orphanage			1
@entity11 told @entity26 how she had tuberculosis , which was not treatable in the @entity45			2
' our parents saved us , ' @entity2 said			2
' @entity11 would not be here if it was not for mom and dad			0
' ' they literally gave us life , ' his sister added			0
' it 's an amazing thing			0
