@entity0 has provided the clearest indication yet that he will recommend @entity3 offer skipper @entity2 a new 12 - month contract			1
it is club policy to offer over- 30s only one - year deals , and 34 - year - old @entity2 ’s existing arrangement expires at the end of the season			1
the @entity3 captain remains a first - choice member of @entity0 ’s squad , forming a formidable partnership with @entity15 in central defence			1
@entity2 is set to be handed a new one - year deal by @entity3 @entity3 ’s manager will make his recommendations to the @entity21 hierarchy regarding @entity2 ’s contractual situation nearer the end of the season			1
and the @entity24 has given a major hint that @entity2 will be offered a new deal after claiming the former @entity28 captain could play for at least three more years			1
‘ every individual is an individual , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ there are old players at the age of 22			2
i know some — 22 and old			2
i know young guys at 36 or 37			2
@entity2 is one of them			1
i had @entity36 at @entity37 who was already 37			2
when the other guys came after a day off from training , he ’d run from his home to burn the energy from his day off			2
i do n’t know ( how long @entity2 can play )			1
the important thing is that , tomorrow , it ’s the next match and he ’s in great condition to play			0
’ @entity2 is 34 and has been @entity3 debut back in 1998 @entity2 has been part of the @entity3 squad since he was 19 @entity0 ’s second spell in charge at @entity50 has given @entity2 a new lease of life when it looked as if his @entity21 career was fizzling out under @entity55			1
and the @entity56 , who also insisted @entity59 ’s new contract will be settled soon , provided a simple explanation			0
‘ our training methodology helps			0
the way he is taking care of himself is very important too , ’ @entity0 said , ‘ but the most important thing of everything is to be happy			0
i read a famous neurologist who said , “ we docs always say do some exercise , eat properly , be careful with salt , be careful with this protein , but we forget to tell people the most important thing : be happy			0
” ‘ @entity2 had a period here of so many doubts , question marks			1
is he still the same player ? can he play at this level ? is he fit ? will he play or be in the stands ? ‘ then , suddenly , the happiness arrives and look at him			0
it ’s been a process			0
when i arrived we played a @entity81 and he was not playing			0
at that moment , he was happy but he was not ready for the high level			0
so it was also a process			0
but the reality is he played so well last season and this season , too			0
’ @entity0 is looking for @entity3 to return to winning ways after defeat at @entity89 last week meanwhile , @entity91 keeper @entity90 has been ruled out of today ’s home match with @entity93 with a minor leg injury , paving the way for @entity96 to make his first @entity97 start this season			1
insisting that @entity96 will not be leaving next month , @entity0 said : ‘ he does n’t need to prove anything to me , the club , his team - mates , to supporters			1
it ’s comfortable to know our goalkeeper tomorrow is @entity96			0

@entity2 made his @entity3 debut back in 1998
@entity2 is 34 and set to be handed a new one - year deal at @entity50
@entity3 face @entity93 and are looking to return to winning ways after defeat at @entity89 last week
