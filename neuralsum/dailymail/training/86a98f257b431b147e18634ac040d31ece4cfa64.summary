by @entity0 published : 04:55 est , 15 september 2013 updated : 05:47 est , 16 september 2013 according to a tourism website , the market town of @entity5 ‘ boasts a number of quirky curiosities ’			1
but a newly found status as the @entity8 capital of @entity9 was probably not what the writers had in mind			2
statistics show that the @entity15 town , with a population of around 6,000 , consumes viagra and similar anti-impotence remedies with a passion which leaves other communities trailing			1
up for loving : the market town of @entity5 in @entity15 which has the highest rate of prescriptions for @entity8 and other anti-impotence drugs of any region in @entity9 last year , 54.87 prescriptions per 1,000 men were issued by @entity28 in the district for erectile dysfunction drugs such as @entity8 , @entity31 and @entity32 , placing the town well ahead of its nearest rival for the title , @entity37 , across the border in @entity39			1
when the @entity41 visited @entity5 yesterday , it did not take long to find one local who readily admitted taking a sex drug			1
@entity44 , who works as a male stripper , proudly admitted to using @entity8 , and boasted : ‘ it boosts my private life and my work life			2
’ the father of three , who is divorced , said : ‘ i use @entity8 all the time			2
i want to perform well and do n’t want to let anyone down			0
‘ i ’m not surprised we have more users than anywhere else in the country , because we ’re more fun			0
’ passion aid : viagra tablets and other erectile dysfunction drugs are being used up and down the country fellow resident @entity59 said he was also not surprised that the peaceful town had been revealed as a stronghold for @entity8 users			1
the 39 - year - old leisure centre manager said : ‘ there ’s a lot of older people living here who are young at heart and energetic			0
’ and @entity69 , a 63 - year - old insurance assessor , added : ‘ we ’re a fun bunch in @entity5 and it seems most of us enjoy happy , healthy sex lives			1
‘ we have nothing to complain about here – there ’s no aggro , no litter and we ’re no @entity79 brigade			0
‘ people have well - paid jobs and decent pensions , and we like to go out or stay in and have a good time			0
’ until now , @entity5 has been most well known as the original home of the company that invented @entity86 and the @entity88 headquarters of the @entity90 motor company			1
and one of those ‘ quirky curiosities ’ that used to be the town ’s main boasts are the stocks outside the old market hall , which were once used to punish drunks and bakers who sold underweight loaves			0
the @entity101 analysis of the @entity103 figures found that @entity37 was the second - biggest consumer of erectile dysfunction drugs , with 43 prescriptions per 1,000 men			1
@entity107 in @entity108 was in third place ( 42 per 1,000 men ) , with @entity111 in @entity112 ( 41 per 1,000 men ) and @entity114 in @entity115 ( 40 per 1,000 men ) making up the top five			2
the statistics revealed that erectile dysfunction medication is more common in rural and coastal areas , while @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 had the lowest rates of use			1
but the figures include only @entity103 prescriptions , and those living in cities are thought more likely than rural residents to acquire supplies through private doctors			2
@entity133 , 38 , owner of the @entity135 pub , believes the number of hostelries in the town might be linked to the rise in @entity8 prescriptions			1
he said : ‘ perhaps they need some assistance after visiting all the pubs			0
there are only a couple of chemists in the town so they must be well stocked up on @entity8			0
’ mapped : figures show the sex remedy is used most in rural areas			0
the figures have shocked residents			0

@entity5 ( population 6,343 ) has highest number of prescriptions for erectile dysfunction drugs
