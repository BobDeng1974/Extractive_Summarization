by @entity0 published : 06:09 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 10:40 est , 29 january 2014 contract : @entity3 is set to earn £ 200,000 as @entity5 's chief correspondent when she starts next month @entity5 's new presenter has been offered a £ 200,000 - a - year contract to lure her away from @entity9 , it has emerged			1
@entity3 , a @entity10 veteran who is currently the business editor at @entity9 , is set to become @entity5 's chief correspondent next month			1
it was today reported that she would be earning a salary of £ 200,000 to appear on the programme , whose average audience has slipped in recent years to just 600,000 viewers			1
her hefty salary - which could be an attempt to stop the star reporter defecting to @entity18 - works out as 33p per viewer			0
the deal , which is said to have angered other @entity10 staff , comes after @entity22 has been widely criticised for the high salaries paid to executives and on - screen stars			1
and @entity5 has itself been embroiled in controversy after the show 's editor was forced to quit in the wake of the @entity32 scandal			0
the programme - which specialises in investigations and hard - hitting interviews - cancelled a programme exposing the former @entity10 star as a paedophile shortly after his death in 2011 , and the next year it falsely accused conservative peer @entity40 of child abuse			2
editor @entity43 resigned and was replaced by @entity45 journalist @entity44 , who has hired ms @entity3 and a number of other presenters in a bid to refresh the 34 - year - old show and boost its viewing figures			0
the new editor is thought to have brought a lighter touch to the programme with segments such as presenter @entity54 dancing with ' zombies ' on @entity56			0
however , he also found himself in hot water when he described @entity59 mp @entity58 , a guest on the programme , as ' boring snoring ' in a message which he accidentally publicised on @entity63			0
ms @entity3 's appointment as chief correspondent was announced in november , although she will not take up her post until next week			1
after the news of her £ 200,000 salary emerged , one @entity10 employee criticised the deal as ' completely over the top ' , telling @entity79 : ' she 's no big ticket name			1
' @entity65 , @entity5 's most popular presenter , is paid around £ 800,000 , while the @entity10 has refused to release details of mr @entity44 's pay			1
twist : @entity54 dancing with zombies is one of the gimmicks brought in by mr @entity44 to boost interest a spokesman for the @entity22 said : ' @entity3 is widely admired as one of the best broadcasters in the country , with a wealth of experience as both a reporter and presenter			0
her appointment is a key part of the renewal of @entity5			0
' one reason for the lucrative contract could be to stop ms @entity3 , 37 , from being tempted by alternative offers - she is tipped as a leading candidate to replace @entity102 as political editor of @entity18			2
the presenter , who was born in @entity105 but grew up in @entity106 and went to the @entity107 , first joined the @entity10 in 2000 and rose to be chief political correspondent for @entity109			2
she moved to @entity9 as business editor in september 2011 .			0

presenter , 37 , is moving from @entity9 to @entity115 's flagship news programme
she is set to be paid £ 200,000 - prompting anger from other @entity10 staff
@entity3 will become the programme 's chief correspondent next month
