on september 1 a @entity1 rocket will blast off from the @entity2 on a mission to the @entity4 and alongside a @entity6 commander and @entity8 flight engineer will be @entity10 soprano @entity9 - who is said to have already paid £ 35 million to fund the outlandish space trip			1
earlier today the 54 - year - old announced more details about the project and revealed some of the gruelling training she is undergoing at the @entity17 in @entity18			1
on september 1 a @entity1 rocket will blast off from the @entity2 on a mission to the @entity21 a @entity6 commander and @entity8 flight engineer will be @entity10 soprano @entity9			1
the singer is pictured during training at @entity17 in @entity18 the trip will make her the eighth so - called ' space tourist ' who has paid millions for the privilege of bloasting into space			1
others include software developer and founder of @entity34 - which makes the @entity36 - based operating system @entity38 - @entity37 , and @entity40 founder @entity39			0
ms @entity9 will begin her 10 - day stint in space and on - board the @entity4 on 1 september			1
she will be accompanied by colonel @entity42 , a 42 - year - old @entity6 who will be leading his third mission into space , and 35 - year - old @entity45 flight engineer @entity45			1
however , she will still need to to receive the basic training all astronauts must endure before being allowed into space			2
at a press conference at the @entity50 in @entity51 the 54 - year - old singer ( pictured left ) said her training lasts for 16 hours a day , starting at 6am , and this includes four hours of @entity6 language classes			1
she will also need to undergo weightlessness training in the @entity6 hydro lab ( pictured right ) a mock - up of the @entity59 spacecraft used to take astronauts to the @entity4 is pictured ms @entity9 said her training lasts for 16 hours a day , starting at 6am , and this includes four hours of @entity6 language classes			1
it also includes being thrown around inside a machine called a centrifuge at high speeds to adjust to the varying levels of g force the journey into space involves			1
this training is taking place at the @entity17 in @entity17 in @entity18 because the crew will travel to the @entity4 on a @entity6 soyuz capsule and need to know how to use it			1
it falls into three phases , which will last until the mission blasts off in september			0
these are @entity79 , @entity80 , and @entity81			0
general space training : this starts up to five years before the mission and involves survival training and a final exam			2
group training : during the @entity80 phase , cosmonauts focus on learning about the @entity59 and @entity4 crew training : the final crew training phase then covers detailed vehicle operations procedures , @entity4 training , and @entity10 language			1
at the @entity96 the training is broken into a further four sections : simulators , weightless environment training facility and a so - called ' hydro lab ' , centrifuge and flying laboratories			2
flying labs ( pictured ) help train cosmonauts to carry out specific technical tests of space equipment			1
in addition , the @entity108 flying lab was built to perform parabolic flights to create short - time weightless and low gravity environments - including lunar and @entity114 gravity simulators at the centre is a mockup facility of @entity118 designed to exercise skills of crews and ground personnel in how to use the systems in the segment			0
this includes a simulator of the @entity126 , @entity127 , a model of @entity118 onboard computer system and the @entity130 ( @entity132 simulator )			0
weightlessness environment training the hydro lab was set up in in 1980 and is designed to train cosmonauts in conditions of simulated weightlessness using water			1
once underwater they are trained how to test space facilities , carry out extravehicular activity and research			0
it is also fitted with full - scale mock - ups of modules , and cranes are used to lift and drop cosmonauts into the water			2
centrifuge centrifuges and centrifuge - based simulators are used to improve the cosmonauts ’ tolerance of @entity154 forces			2
when g - loads are applied regularly the body 's central nervous system adapts and can better manage blood flow , for example			0
the first centrifuge , called @entity161 - 7 , was installed in 1973 and was designed to study the influence of spaceflight on the human body , reduce negative effects of acceleration , and test aeronautical and space engineering models			1

it also includes being thrown around inside a machine called a centrifuge at high speeds to adjust to the varying levels of g force the journey into space involves			1
this is to help the three astronauts cope with the cramped conditions in the small capsule - like ship that will carry them to the space station			1

ms @entity9 is pictured at the @entity6 test facility at the event ms @entity9 also revealed her ‘ mission patch ’ , a logo ( pictured ) which shows an emblem of her with arms outstretched next to a union jack , @entity214 , and @entity6 flag , outlined against the earth and moon ms @entity9 will be accompanied to the @entity4 ( pictured ) by colonel @entity42 , a 42 - year - old @entity6 who will be leading his third mission into space , and 35 - year - old @entity45 flight engineer @entity45			1
she will be the eight so - called ' space tourist ' to pay for an interstellar trip this training is taking place at the @entity17 in @entity17 in @entity18 because the crew will travel to the @entity4 on a @entity6 soyuz capsule and need to know how to use it			1
at today 's press conference the 54 - year - old singer said she was inspired by early space travel			1
‘ when i was nine years old i watched the first man on the moon , ' explained ms @entity9			2
‘ it actually changed my perception about life			0
‘ suddenly my mind opened and i started to really work on the career i have now			0
‘ i thank that moment , it was pivotal in my life			0
‘ i never really talked about it as it could never be a reality , it was all very abstract			0
‘ but it was always my ambition to fly to space , its something i dreamed about and wanted			0
’ the future cosmonaut also rebutted a question about how the trip was being funded , saying ‘ i paid for this myself , it was something i always wanted to do			0
’ she added : ‘ i ca n’t currently say what the amount is			0
’ at a press conference at the @entity50 in @entity51 , ms @entity9 said : ‘ i ’m just incredibly excited to go			2
’ asked whether she planned to ‘ be a @entity255 ’ she laughed and said : ‘ i might when i ’m up there do one of the movements from that - i ’ll see how it goes			0
’ the joke made reference to ms @entity9 's 1978 top 10 single ' ( i lost my heart ) to a @entity266			1
' she added that her ex-husband @entity267 had also been involved in her plans to become the first ever international artist to perform live from space , and the pair has recorded a song about her mission due to be released later this year			2
‘ i have mentioned that i would like to sing something from space , ' ms @entity9 said			1
' i have been working a little bit with @entity267 who has come up with a line for something			0
' i have been working on various things , its finding a song which suits the idea of space , something that ’s incredibly simple , because to sing in negative gravity is incredibly different to singing down here			2
‘ i ’m trying to find a piece which is beautiful and simple in its message , as well as not too complicated to sing			0
’ ms @entity9 is shown left putting on her spacesuit			0
in the right - hand image the singer is shown adjusting a harness and seat			0
this seat is a mock - up of the one she will sit in during the @entity59 journey this training is taking place at the @entity17 in @entity17 in @entity18 because the crew will travel to the @entity4 on a @entity6 soyuz capsule and need to know how to use it ms @entity9 is pictured inside a hyperbaric chamber			1
hyperbaric chambers create an environment in which the atmospheric pressure of oxygen is increased above normal levels			0
the high concentrations of oxygen can reduce the size of gas bubbles in the blood and improve blood flow to oxygen - starved tissues scientists are also working on ironing ' out the technical side of how to make the performance work '			0
she went on to tell the event ’s host , @entity316 , that she has been studying hard and ends her day of lectures by getting a cup of coffee , some food , and carrying on studying			0
‘ the reason i do a lot of studying in the evening is really for my own confidence , ' added ms @entity9			0
‘ i want to understand why lights come up on the panel [ of the spacecraft ] , all the things i need to know			0

@entity9 will board the @entity59 space rocket on september 1
she will be blasted into space along with two other cosmonauts
@entity372 will spend 10 days on the space station before returning to @entity374
the 54 - year - old is undergoing 16 hours of training a day in @entity18
this includes four hours @entity6 language classes , weightlessness and g - force simulations , and engineering tests
it is *estimated* her *extra-terrestrial* trip will cost more than £ *34million*
she is also *hoping* to sing a song she wrote for the trip while in space
