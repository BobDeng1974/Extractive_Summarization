by @entity0 published : 07:47 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 07:48 est , 20 august 2013 biomarkers in the blood can be used to identify people at risk of suicide , a study suggests			2
@entity8 research raises the controversial prospect of a blood test providing early warning of suicide attempts			2
scientists said their results were ' proof of principle ' for a suicide test , while @entity18 experts reacted with scepticism			1
@entity8 experts hope a simple blood test could help detect and treat those at a higher risk of committing suicide			1
however @entity18 scientist are treating the findings cautiously , saying it is one thing to find a biomarker but quite another to use it as a predictor of future behaviour one particular molecule , an enzyme called @entity33 , was linked to suicidal tendencies in a group of patients with bipolar disorder , a mental illness characterised by episodes of extreme high and low moods			1
three other markers showed a weaker @entity42 elevated blood markers stood out in a subgroup of nine patients who displayed a sudden dramatic shift to powerful suicidal thoughts			2
a similar pattern was seen in blood samples taken from nine suicide victims who had succeeded in killing themselves			0
finally blood samples were tested from two further groups of patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia - type pychoses			1
it is hoped that a test could be developed that would flag up those who will not admit they are severely depressed raised levels of the biomarkers correlated with admissions to hospital after suicide attempts			0
the link was stronger for bipolar disorder than for schizophrenia			1
study leader dr @entity67 , from @entity68 , said : ' suicide is a big problem in psychiatry			0
it 's a big problem in the civilian realm , it 's a big problem in the military realm and there are no objective markers			2
' there are people who will not reveal they are having suicidal thoughts when you ask them , who then commit it and there 's nothing you can do about it			1
we need better ways to identify , intervene and prevent these tragic cases			0
' these seem to be good markers for suicidal behaviour in males who have bipolar mood disorders or males in the general population who commit impulsive violent suicide			1
in the future we want to study and assemble clinical and socio - demographic risk factors , along with our blood tests , to increase our ability to predict risk			2
' he acknowledged one limitation of the research , published in the journal @entity106 , was that the participants were all male			0
' there could be gender differences , ' he said			0
' we would also like to conduct more extensive , normative studies in the population at large			0
' he plans to conduct further research focusing on more deliberate and planned suicides			0
in their paper , the scientists point to a link between @entity33 and polyamine , a chemical involved in apoptosis , or ' cell suicide ' - the programmed self destruction of damaged or harmful cells			1
@entity18 scientists said the research should be treated with caution			1
professor @entity130 , from the @entity128 at @entity129 , stressed the need to have the results replicated by other studies			0
he added : ' it 's one thing to find a biomarker which might be associated at a statistical level with suicidal behaviour			1
it 's quite another to use it to make any kind of prediction which has clinical utility			0
' these findings may attract media attention , but they are very much preliminary and my money would be on failed replication and even if replication was successful , lack of predictive power to be a useful clinical tool			0

@entity8 experts found that an enzyme , called @entity33 , was linked to suicidal tendencies in a group of people with bipolar disorder
@entity18 scientists are sceptical however , saying that it 's one thing to find a biomarker but another to use it as a predictor of future behaviour
