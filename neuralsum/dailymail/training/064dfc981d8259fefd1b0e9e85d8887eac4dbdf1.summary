four others were hurt , including van driver @entity30 , who is still being treated for multiple injuries			1
mr @entity30 , who was left in a coma for two weeks , had just returned from holiday and , because he was tired , decided to pull over and sleep in the back of the van			1
but @entity2 – believing the layby was an exit slip road - drove into the back of the vehicle , spinning it around , and throwing mr @entity30 out			2
the victim landed on the dual - carriageway , where it is believed he was run over by another vehicle as the driver tried to avoid the crash debris			0

‘ knowing what you had done , knowing you passenger was dead or dying , or at the very least seriously injured , you left without any regard for anyone else			0
‘ you did not stay to call for assistance but you fled the scene			0
‘ you stole another vehicle , for the second time that morning drove while disqualified and without insurance , in order to avoid detection			0
‘ it also meant it was not possible for you to be tested for alcohol			0
’ @entity2 - who denies that he was over the limit and says he probably mistook the lay - by for a nearby slip road - admitted causing death by careless driving at 4am on the @entity88 of the @entity60 at @entity61 , @entity62 , on march 18 this year			1
he also admitted driving while disqualified , without insurance , failing to stop and failing to report the accident			2
flying fists : @entity92 ( in the black and red top ) fights with rival gangs of relatives , friends and associates of @entity98 and his brother @entity99 and @entity2 outside @entity101 magistrates court in may spectacle : @entity8 is confronted by a thug as passers - by gathered and looked while the families squared up to each other			1
police arrived soon after and they were arrested squaring up : eight men have now admitted their involvement in the violence which erupted as part of a long - standing feud between the groups he went on to admit driving the @entity115 without consent and without insurance together with a separate incident of dangerous driving in @entity101 in may of last year when he fled at speed from police , together with other motoring offences			1
an earlier charge of causing death by dangerous driving was dropped			1
@entity2 , who lives with his family at the @entity128 in @entity129 , initially denied being behind the wheel			0
but he changed his plea when his dna was found in his blood and saliva on the air bag of the crashed @entity16 , proving conclusively that he was the driver			0

mr @entity30 had a fractured skull , bleeding into the brain , a fractured cheek bone and shoulder , bruised chest , lung damage , his pelvis was shattered and he had three fractures to his neck			0
bloodied : @entity2 after part of his ear was bitten off , in an image originally posted to his @entity156 page in a victim impact statement he told how it had been totally life - changing			2
@entity2 ’s passengers @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 were also hurt during the trip to @entity164 to @entity165 , where they had been in a pub just hours earlier			2

mr @entity161 had a fractured neck and collar bone and other injuries to his knee and hand			0
mr @entity162 had a laceration to his face			0
judge @entity63 said that as a result of @entity2 ’s irresponsible driving , a young man was killed , an entirely innocent man suffered life - threatening injuries , and three of his other passengers were seriously hurt			2
he had been in a pub the previous evening in @entity165 , with passengers he drove while disqualified and without passengers , and did not think it important enough to have sufficient regard for the safety of other road users			0
the incident occurred while he was on bail for an earlier allegation of dangerous driving in @entity101			2
the case in @entity64 was also seriously aggravated by his previous convictions for dangerous driving , careless driving , no insurance and drink driving			1
unlikely pair : after becoming friends on celebrity big brother , @entity51 , the wife of the @entity207 , went to visit @entity2 at his caravan site home the judge stressed that no sentence was intended to reflect the value of the life lost - a loving partner and devoted father of four			1
@entity216 , defending , said that his client was full of remorse for what he had done and the way he had behaved after the crash			0
the sentencing comes just two weeks after he escaped jail over a bare knuckle brawl between feuding families outside @entity101 magistrates ’ court			1
