private first class @entity1 was awarded the @entity2 after his death in an ambush in @entity3 on february 1 , 1966 , while serving in the @entity13 's @entity12			1
his daughter , @entity14 , was just a toddler when he died , and when she turned 18 , her mother gave her @entity1 's @entity13 medals , the flag that had covered his coffin and a photo album from his military service			1
' the medal was really all that i did have from my father , ' said @entity14 , now a 51 - year - old mother of eight from @entity25 in central @entity26			2
but years later , the @entity2 disappeared while she was living outside @entity27 , where her father grew up			2

@entity47 , @entity34 's mother , said the medal mostly sat in a drawer in the kitchen of her family 's home in @entity54			2

then , last @entity66 , the now 34 - year - old @entity34 was visiting from @entity67 when his wife saw the medal and asked why the family had it since @entity34 , an @entity72 veteran , had n't been wounded			1
