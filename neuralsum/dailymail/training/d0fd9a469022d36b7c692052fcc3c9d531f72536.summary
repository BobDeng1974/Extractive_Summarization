for a goalkeeper widely viewed as a liability in the first part of the season , @entity1 's transformation has been quite remarkable			2
the @entity7 stopper has n't conceded a @entity9 goal in 390 minutes , playing his role in a @entity12 resurgence that sees the @entity13 thinking about the top four again			1
the @entity14 has n't let in a goal since the hour mark of their @entity18 draw with @entity19 , subsequently keeping clean sheets in the league fixtures with @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
only @entity39 's @entity38 ( 11 ) and @entity41 's @entity40 ( 9 ) have recorded more shutouts than @entity1 's eight			0
@entity45 's @entity44 has also kept eight clean sheets and has played one game more than @entity1			1
but the @entity7 man still has a better record of clean sheets than the likes of @entity28 , @entity52 and @entity53			2
@entity1 's form had become so patchy he was dropped by @entity55 for the match with @entity57 at @entity58 back in december			1
@entity1 fails to keep out an effort from @entity60 during @entity7 's match with @entity62 in october @entity1 was at fault for this @entity65 goal for @entity66 in the @entity67 earlier this season @entity68 took over for that game and subsequent matches with @entity71 in the @entity72 and @entity73 in the league before suffering an injury at @entity76			1
since being restored to the side , @entity1 seems to have eradicated some of the mistakes , especially with crosses and in one - on - one situations , that had caused @entity55 such anxiety			2
the manager noted his improvement in comments made last week : ' @entity1 's shown the benefits of having a bit of time out of the side			0
' he looks like a different goalkeeper			0
@entity91 's spell out was for him to take a step back , analyse performance and the areas where he could improve			0
@entity1 has kept more @entity9 clean sheets this season than @entity57 's @entity28 @entity1 has also kept more clean sheets than @entity99 stopper and compatriot @entity52 @entity55 has been impressed by @entity1 's transformation since he was dropped from the team ' he 's a wonderful shot - stopper , he 's starting to be more aggressive with crosses and is probably thinking less			1
' i 'm delighted for him because he has worked very hard at his game			0
' @entity1 will be vital as @entity7 hurtle into an important phase of the season - they play fellow top - four contenders @entity109 at @entity110 on tuesday night , then head to @entity111 in the @entity113 fifth round			0
next week also sees the resumption of their @entity116 campaign with two legs against @entity119 side @entity118 .			0
