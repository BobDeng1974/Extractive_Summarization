by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 06:14 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 18:51 est , 13 november 2012 under fire : president @entity3 has been rocked by a second national security scandal within a week of his election for a second term general @entity8 believed he could keep his affair with his biographer @entity11 secret even after he was interviewed by the @entity12 , it emerged today			1
after meeting @entity8 on october 21 and also conducting two interviews with @entity11 , the second on november 2nd , the @entity12 had concluded that no criminal charges would be brought			1
but the @entity12 appears to have decided to inform the @entity16 after a @entity18 - based agent informed a @entity20 member of @entity21 of the investigation			1
this was the same agent who had triggered the inquiry when his friend the socialite @entity26 complained to him about anonymous harassing emails			2
the fallout now threatens to engulf general @entity29 of the @entity30 , the @entity31 commander in @entity32			0
he is said to have exchanged between 20,000 and 30,000 pages of emails with @entity26 since 2010			0
to complicate matters further , the @entity12 agent had allegedly sent shirtless photos of himself to @entity26 before she reported the harassing emails to him and had been told not to interfere in the investigation			1
the agent , depicted by government officials as a right - winger , contacted representative @entity43 and asked for a member of the @entity16 @entity20 leadership			1
on october 31st , @entity43 put him in contact with representative @entity47 , @entity48			0
@entity47 informed the @entity12 of his conversation with the @entity12 agent , now himself under internal investigation , but did not make the matter public			1
@entity47 apparently knew of the @entity12 investigation into @entity8 ' affair eight days before president @entity3			1
the allegedly harassing emails were discovered to have been sent by @entity11			0
it is believed that @entity29 received at least one email from the same email account used by @entity11 to contact @entity26			2
scandals : @entity61 general @entity29 ( left ) , commander of @entity31 forces in @entity32 is under investigation over thousands of emails sent to a @entity18 housewife following the resignation general @entity8 ( right ) @entity29 is now under investigation by the @entity69 's inspector general and his @entity71 confirmation hearings for the new post of @entity31 's supreme allied commander @entity73 , originally due on thursday , have been put on hold			1
a senior defence official told reporters that it was alleged there had been ' inappropriatecommunications ' between @entity77 , defence secretary , said in a statement if @entity29 follows @entity8 into retirement it will leave mr @entity3 with two gaping holes to fill at the heart of his national security team at a time when he is also expected to be replacing his secretaries of state , defence and treasury			1
it is unclear exactly when fbi director @entity94 and attorney - general @entity95 were informed although it has emerged that the investigation began as early as may			1
general @entity29 is under investigation by the @entity12 after the discoverey of between 20,000 and 30,000 pages of communication between him and housewife @entity26 , ( pictured ) @entity3 was only informed of the scandal just two days after last tuesday 's @entity61 election , according to the @entity16 , and accepted @entity8 's resignation the following day			1
senator @entity106 , @entity107 chair of the @entity108 said : ' this is certainly an operationally sensitive matter			0
' but we were n't briefed			0
i do n't know who made that decision			0
' so it is very puzzling and i think was a mistake , because this thing just came so fast and so hard			0
and since then , it 's been like peeling an onion			0
every day , another peel comes off			0
' representative @entity120 , the @entity20 chair of the @entity121 said : ' this is a crisis , i believe , of major proportions			2
' it 's not the usual political thing			0
we 're not talking about the secretary of commerce or some undersecretary somewhere			0
we 're talking about the heads of the @entity12			2
' @entity120 argued that the case ' had to be brought to the president , or certainly to the @entity132			2
if not , the @entity12 was derelict in its duty			2
' i do n't want to raise any conspiracy theories , but i certainly have questions , ' he said			0
@entity77 said @entity29 , 58 , would remain as commander of @entity61 and @entity31 forces in @entity32 for now , ' while the matter is under investigation and before the facts are determined			0
' adultery can be considered a crime in the military and while as @entity146 director @entity8 was a civilian , the potential security breach could have left him open to blackmail or undermined his credibility with his staff			2
@entity8 , who has been married to wife @entity149 for 38 years , admitted to having an affair with his biographer , the former @entity152 officer @entity11			1
he had been due to testify at closed - door congressional inquiries into the deadly september 11 attack on the @entity61 consulate in @entity156 , @entity157 , but will now be replaced at least temporarily by acting cia director @entity158			0
one name being floated as a possible replacement is @entity161 , the @entity16 counter-terrorism adviser and a @entity146 veteran who has played an instrumental role in mr @entity3 's drone war against @entity166 militants			1
@entity26 was thrust into the public eye when she was the target of supposedly threatening emails from @entity11 , which the @entity12 used to uncover the affair between @entity172 and @entity8 , leading to the former general 's resignation from the @entity146			1
affair : @entity8 is pictured with @entity11 , his biographer and alleged mistress @entity178 , a retired army colonel and former @entity8 spokesman , said his former boss told him over the weekend that the affair with his biographer , @entity11 , began about two months after he became @entity146 director and ended four months ago			1
' he is devastated , you could say , and you could also say that it 's going to take a long time for the family or some time for the family to get through this , but they will , ' mr @entity178 said			0
it all unravelled when a @entity191 woman went to the @entity12 in the early summer after she began receiving threatening emails accusing her of a flirtation with the general , the @entity189 said			1
a government official told the @entity196 that the emails contained such language as : ' i know what you did ' , ' back off ' and ' stay away from my guy '			0
@entity26 , is described as a ' social liaison officer ' to the @entity204 in @entity191			0
she and her husband @entity205 had been friends with @entity8 and his wife @entity149 for about five years			2
@entity161 , the @entity16 counter-terrorism adviser and a @entity146 veteran is being floated as a possible replacement @entity146 chief the @entity12 soon traced the emails to @entity11 , who had been given unprecedented access to his command in @entity32 last year to write her glowing biography			1
the agents eventually discovered sexually explicit emails between @entity8 and @entity11 indicating the affair			1
@entity11 was found to be in possession of some classified material , but @entity8 was not thought to have given them to her .			2

@entity8 thought he could avoid *disgrace* because @entity12 concluded there would be no criminal charges brought
but @entity12 agent , who sent *topless* pictures of himself to woman at centre of affair , went to @entity20 congressman
@entity8 investigation believed to have began in may but president @entity3 ' not informed until after the election '
questions being asked by @entity21 as to why they and @entity16 were kept out of the loop for so long
