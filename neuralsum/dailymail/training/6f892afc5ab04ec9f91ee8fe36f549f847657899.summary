by @entity0 a mysterious disease is causing starfish to tear themselves to pieces			1
the arms of infected starfish begin to twist and then ‘ crawl ’ away from the creature ’s body , until they tear off and the animal ’s insides spill out			1
divers and scientists first noticed the horrific disease off the coast of @entity16 , but sightings of dead starfish have been reported as far north as @entity19 and in southern @entity20			1
the arms of infected starfish begin to twist and then ' crawl ' away from the creature 's body , until they tear off ( pictured ) the disease prevents the creatures from growing new arms like healthy starfish and they die within approximately 24 hours , according to a report by @entity33			1
@entity34 have been dying by the millions in recent months along the @entity36 west coast , worrying biologists who say the sea creatures are key to the marine ecosystem			2
scientists first started noticing the mass deaths in one species – the sunflower starfish - in june 2013 , but the disease , which has been dubbed sea star wasting syndrome - has now spread to 12 species			1
different types of starfish are affected , from wild ones along the coast to those in captivity , according to @entity54 , director of the @entity56 's @entity55			2
scientists first started noticing the mass deaths in one species - the sunflower starfish - in june 2013 , but the disease , which has been dubbed sea star wasting syndrome - has now spread to 12 species			1
a healthy sunflower starfish is pictured ' the two species affected most are @entity66 ( purple sea star or ochre starfish ) and @entity70 ( sunflower sea star ) , ' he wrote in a statement in december			2
the sunflower starfish is considered among the largest of all the species and can span more than a metre in diameter			0
the most commonly observed symptoms of the suspected disease are white lesions on the arms of the starfish			1
the lesions spread rapidly , resulting in the loss of the arm			0
the infection consumes the creature 's entire body and tears itself to pieces			2
entire populations have been wiped out in @entity90 off the coast of @entity16 , in the @entity92 off @entity94 's @entity93 as well as along the coast of @entity20			1
the mortality rate is estimated at 95 per cent			0
divers and scientists first noticed the horrific disease off the coast of @entity16 in the @entity100 , but sightings of dead starfish have been reported as far north as @entity19 and in southern @entity20 @entity103 , a biology professor at @entity104 , collected healthy starfish and those showing symptoms of the disease to study in his laboratory at first , the starfish twist their arms into knots and then legions form on their skin , before the arm tears away from the body ( pictured ) one diver said the scene under the waves was reminiscent of something from a horror film as there are ‘ bodies everywhere ’			1
scientists who have spent decades studying the local ecosystem have yet to identify the cause			0
' what we currently think is likely happening is that there is a pathogen , like a parasite or a virus or a bacteria , that is infecting the sea stars and that compromises in some way their immune system , ' @entity136 , chair of the department of ecology and evolutionary biology , at the @entity140 , @entity140 , told @entity143			0
the creatures are thought to become more susceptible to bacteria which is ‘ causing a secondary infection that causes most of the damages that you see			2
' @entity103 , a biology professor at @entity104 collected healthy starfish and those showing symptoms of the disease to study in his laboratory			1
he told @entity33 that he came across arms and piles of deteriorating sea stars off the coast of @entity156			2
at first , the starfish twist their arms into knots and then lesions form on their skin			1
their arms then crawl away from their own body until they tear off and the animal ’s insides spill out , he explained			1
‘ they start ripping themselves apart , ’ he said			2
the animals destroy themselves within 24 hours of the symptoms appearing			1
here is all that was left of one animal that tore itself apart the 2013 phenomenon has not been observed solely along the @entity178 as a smaller outbreak also killed @entity181 sea stars last year , leading a few scientists to speculate that ocean acidification or even climate change could be to blame , while most think an exotic pathogen is attacking the animals			2
previous cases were believed to be associated with warmer waters - starfish have sensitive skin and prefer cooler water - but most scientists do not believe this to be the case this time around			0
biologists are worried about the decline of the sea creatures , which are key to the marine ecosystem			0
a stock image of the sunflower starfish is pictured when the die - offs happened previously , the geographic span of the infections was much smaller and far fewer sea stars were affected			0
in 1983 , an epidemic nearly wiped out the @entity66 from tidal pools along the southern coast of @entity20			0
another , smaller die - off in 1997 may have been caused by warmer waters in an @entity210 year , scientists said			0
' sea stars are important because ' they play a key role in this ecosystem on the @entity178 , ' dr @entity136 said			0
@entity34 eat mussels , barnacles , snails , molluscs and other smaller sea life , so their health is considered a measure of marine life on the whole in a given area			0
dr @entity54 said that when starfish decline in number , ' the mussel population has the potential to dramatically increase , which could significantly alter the rocky intertidal zone			0
' while starfish make up an important component of the base of the ocean food chain and are considered a top predator , they are in turn eaten by other starfish , shorebirds , gulls , and sometimes sea otters			0
in an effort to find out what is causing the mass deaths , scientists are collecting reports from the public , taking specimens to the lab for analysis and doing genetic sequencing to find out whether a toxin or an infection may be to blame			0
citizen scientists are being encouraged to report any sightings of dead starfish and their exact location on social media sites , by using # @entity257 .			1

the arms of infected starfish begin to twist and then ‘ crawl ’ away from the creature ’s body , until they tear off and the animal ’s insides spill out
divers and scientists first noticed the horrific disease off the coast of @entity16 but there have been sightings elsewhere too
mystery disease prevents the creatures from growing new arms like healthy starfish and they die within approximately 24 hours
