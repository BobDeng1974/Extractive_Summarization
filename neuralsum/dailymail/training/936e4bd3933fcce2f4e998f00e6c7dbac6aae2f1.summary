by @entity0 published : 15:03 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 15:03 est , 31 may 2013 a little known but fatal illness called @entity2 is spreading at an unprecedented speed across the @entity4 due to the dry weather			1
the condition also known as coccidioidomycosis is caused when a naturally occurring soil fungus is disrupted and inhaled initially causes flu like symptoms but can become deadly if untreated			1
government estimates say more than 160,000 people living in arid areas of the @entity14 including large swathes of @entity16 and @entity17 get the illness every year			1
drought : @entity2 is increased in dry weather conditions which are likely to be seen across the southwest in coming months under the microscope : @entity2 also known as coccidioidomycosis is caused when naturally occurring soil fungus is disrupted and inhaled of that number 160 will die as a result and is the exponential rise in the number of cases year - on - year that is causing concern			1
' i think suddenly people realized this was an ongoing problem , ' dr. @entity30 , the director of the @entity31 at @entity32 in @entity33 told @entity37			0
' but a small percentage of people get really serious problems , when the fungus either does n't go away in your lungs , or it moves through the blood stream to other parts of the body , like the brain or bones or the skin			1
' his concerns were reiterated by dr @entity52 , professor of medicine at @entity54 and chief of infectious diseases at @entity57			0
' valley fever is a very common problem here , and it devastates people 's lives , ' he told the broadcaster			0
increasing : the number of cases climbed exponentially up to 2011 - a record year for @entity2 @entity4 : the illness effects arid areas of the @entity14 which tend to be in the @entity4 ' but many patients do n't know about it , and some physicians are only vaguely aware of it because half of our physicians come from out of state			1
' from 1998 to 2011 , the number of @entity2 cases rose by more than 850 per cent according to the @entity76			2
in @entity16 alone cases rose from 700 in 1998 to more than 5,000 cases in 2011			0
across the country there were 22,000 cases in 2011 but doctors estimate a further 150,000 were unreported			0
@entity2 - also known as coccidioidomycosis - is caused when a naturally occurring soil fungus is disrupted and inhaled in affected areas it is more likely when weather conditions are hot and dry and dust which carries the fungus is more common it initially causes flu like symptoms but can become deadly if untreated			1
it can damage the lungs , spread to the brain and bones and even cause blindness government estimates say more than 160,000 people living in arid areas of the @entity14 including large swathes of @entity16 and @entity17 get the illness every year of that number 160 people die as a result while 150,000 do n't report it - in many cases not realizing they have it those most at risk include people who work outside in areas where the fungus naturally occurs both @entity16 and @entity17 saw a slight drop in incidence last year but experts say they were exceptions to the ever growing trend			1
the illness is caused when tiny spores carried by soil dust are dislodged by construction , wind or human activity			1
in cases where the illness becomes serious it can spread from the lungs to the brain and even eyes , causing blindness , skin abscesses and organ failure			2
warmer conditions create more dust and therefore more chance of illness - making this year 's drought a real cause for concern			1
' research has shown that when soil is dry and it is windy , more spores are likely to become airborne in endemic areas , ' said dr. @entity142 , deputy director of the @entity143 at the @entity144 told @entity37			2
62 inmates of @entity16 's @entity146 and @entity147 were killed earlier this month by the condition and the prisons ' 3,300 inmates had to be moved because infection rates were so high			0
doctors said the high incidence was a ' public health emergency '			0
in the same week 28 workers at a solar power plant construction site in @entity157 were taken ill. last year , @entity159 first baseman @entity158 famously caught the illness mid-season and was taken out of action			2
@entity2 is caused by fungal organisms called coccidioides and when in the lungs can cause chest pain and coughing			1
sufferer : @entity168 - a winemaker in @entity169 , @entity16 has @entity2 and says he is in constant pain cutting out risk : doctors advise those living in desert areas in @entity16 and @entity17 , pictured , to avoid breathing in the deadly fungus the disease is often misdiagnosed and sufferers often have no noticeable symptoms at all			1
a drought following a strong rainy season is the worst condition for spreading the disease			2
@entity184 causes spores to grow and then hot windy weather spread them			0
new residents in areas where the disease is prevalent are more susceptible because their bodies are n't used to the fungus while those who work outdoors in desert conditions are also more likely to catch it			2
@entity168 - a winemaker in @entity169 , @entity16 - is one such sufferer and he is in ' constant pain ' according to @entity37			0
medication to treat the illness means he ca n't taste his own wine			0
' it 'll change your life , it 's as simple as that , ' he told the broadcaster			0
' sometimes it 's excruciating , sometimes -- it 's always a dull roar			0
' ' i know it 's compromising my life , and i know it 'll probably end my life sooner than later			0
' doctors advise those working outside in summer months wear masks to try and avoid catching valley fever			0
residents of arid areas are also advised to stay inside during dust storms and keep windows shut .			1

doctors have warned that a dangerous season for @entity2 may be *ahead* for many parts of the @entity4
the *potentially* fatal condition is caused when sufferers breath in fungus carried by soil dust known as coccidioides
more than 160,000 people living in arid areas get the illness every year
drier conditions and drought increase dust causing more fungus to be spread
