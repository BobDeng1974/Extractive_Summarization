a desperate pensioner who was bombarded by demands from his council to repay benefits they had overpaid him turned himself into a human fireball to end his life			1
@entity7 , 66 , wrote to @entity8 after he received 10 demands for more than £ 800 he had been mistakenly overpaid in benefits to tell them he could not afford to pay the lump sum and did not understand why he was being asked to repay the cash			1
in his letters the pensioner told the council he was stressed and depressed and was just ' trying to survive			1
' but his pleas were ignored and the retired gardener killed himself			0
@entity7 turned himself into a human fireball after he was received demands from @entity21 council for £ 800 he had been mistakenly overpaid in council tax , and had his pleas that he could not afford it ignored council officials have admitted they failed to respond to his pleas for help and their letters - sent at a rate of once a month for almost a year - were of an ' inappropriate tone '			1
in may last year mr @entity7 drove himself to the @entity29 in @entity30 and set himself alight in his @entity31			1
teenagers tried to help him by tackling the flames but he died in hospital from 100 per cent second degree burns			0
@entity36 , coroner for @entity30 , said : ' this is the tragic tale of a man who lived all his life in the @entity40 being caught up in the changes of the government benefit system			2
' he is a man who clearly needed help but unfortunately @entity8 were unable to give it to him			2
' there was no deliberate attempt to avoid payment - he was overwhelmed by such a large sum			2
' at an inquest into mr @entity7 's death , the court heard that the pensioner , who lived alone , had spent much of his life in receipt of state handouts after illnesses forced him to quit his job as a gardener			1
he had a state and work pension and was entitled to housing benefit and council tax benefit but government changes in january 2013 meant his housing allowance was almost halved			1
mr @entity7 was not informed of the changes and a backlog at @entity8 meant his payments were not changed			1
the pensioner was belatedly informed that the mistake meant he had continued to be paid £ 89.39 in housing credits instead of £ 44.79 and as a result owed the council £ 809.79			1
@entity8 has admitted the volley of 10 letters sent to mr @entity7 had an ' inappropriate tone ' in june 2013 he was told a mistake had been made and he would have to pay back more than £ 800			1
the pensioner received 10 letters over the next few months until may 2014			2
he wrote to the council to explain his confusion and that he simply could not repay the money in one go , but received no response			1
' i ca n't remember the last time i had £ 800 in my possession , ' he wrote			1
' i 'm now more stressed , depressed and suicidal than any of my previous letters			0
i have no savings or assets			0
' i 'm not trying to live			0
i 'm trying to survive			0
' mr @entity36 , sitting at @entity89 , @entity30 , added : ' i will be writing to @entity8 to ask them to establish some kind of system to help vulnerable people , like @entity7 , get in touch			1
' unfortunately now some people do n't understand that not everyone has ipods and laptops and that some old people , and other people too , just do n't understand the internet			0
' they 're very quick to refer people to their website but not everyone can do that			0
' in a statement @entity8 admitted that the correspondence with the pensioner had not been handled properly but claimed there was nothing to suggest he was upset by the situation			1
it said : ' the authorities responded to all of his letters up until the last letter which was closed on the system without a response , this is regrettable			0
the responses did n't really address his issues and they were not really an appropriate tone			0
' i could not find anything in the context of his letters that would have alerted of the author 's state of mind			0
' after the inquest the council added : a @entity8 spokesperson said : ' we will await the letter from the coroner , review our ways of working and change how we deliver this service as a result			2
as the coroner has acknowledged , @entity8 was under particular pressure in early 2013			2
this was at a time of huge government benefit changes while the council was also dealing with some of the harshest cuts to local government anywhere in the country			2
that backlog from 2013 has now been cleared to manageable levels			0
' speaking after the inquest , his sister , @entity150 said : ' he was a very quiet and proud man			0
we knew nothing about this until after his death			0
