@entity1 safety regulators are pushing for a nationwide recall of cars with potentially lethal defective @entity5 air bags , increasing pressure on the industry to move faster in a growing scandal			1
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) also criticized @entity10 for what it called ' an unwillingness to move forward ' on a recall , and said the company needs to be open with the @entity1 public about the risks of its air bags			1
@entity19 @entity5 and automakers have so far taken a targeted approach in recalling @entity1 vehicles with air bags that can rupture upon deployment , shooting shrapnel into the car			1
the earlier recall limited to several mostly southern @entity1 states needed to be expanded to the full country , said @entity30 , deputy administrator of the @entity9			1
' we 're pushing @entity10 and all affected manufacturers to issue the recall and to ensure the recalls capture the full scope of the problems			0
' the agency warned that if @entity10 - subject of a @entity1 criminal investigation into its exploding air bags - and the manufacturers do not quickly make the recall voluntarily , it will use its powers to force one			1
on tuesday it also ordered @entity10 to provide documents and other detailed information on the propellant used in its air bag inflators			1
' in recent days , @entity10 has publicly conceded that it changed the chemical mix of its air bag inflator propellant in newly designed inflators , ' the @entity9 said			1
' as part of its ongoing investigation , the agency will analyze the information received to determine if the chemical composition of @entity10 's propellant mix may be a cause and / or contributing factor in the air bag inflator ruptures			2
' five fatalities , including four in the @entity1 , have been linked to the airbags			0
the @entity1 regional recall involved 4.1 million cars hot and humid areas where the air bags may be prone to fail , including @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and parts of @entity81 along the @entity82			2
most of those cars are made by @entity85 , @entity10 's biggest client			0
senator @entity87 , pictured during a hearing on @entity89 , supported a nationwide recall			2
she said if auto manufacturers did not comply she was in favor of forced measures @entity94 , @entity85 , @entity95 and @entity96 said they would continue to cooperate with @entity9 and plan to evaluate their call for a national recall			1
but each stopped short of saying they would expand beyond the current set of cars they are fixing			0
@entity104 is already recalling air bags nationally			0
spokesman @entity106 said @entity10 would cooperate with regulators and automakers if an expanded recall is required , but noted that ' of almost 1,000 passenger and driver inflators from outside the high humidity areas that have been evaluated to date , none have ruptured '			2
' @entity10 is concerned that a national recall could potentially divert replacement air bags from where they 're needed , putting lives at risk , ' he said in a statement			1
it 's unclear just how long it could take to replace so many air bags			0
@entity9 said it is pressuring @entity10 to ramp up production of replacement parts and has said it will explore using other suppliers to help with production if needed			0
a @entity5 employee sews an airbag at the company 's crash - testing facility in @entity131 , @entity132 @entity10 has said it would add two production lines at its @entity135 , @entity138 plant in january to make replacement air bag inflators			0
workers there have told @entity142 that a single line has a typical quota of around 200 inflators an hour , meaning it could take five months to make 1 million inflators working around the clock on two lines , five days a week			0
@entity1 senator @entity87 , who is the chairman of the panel on consumer protection , supported a nationwide recall			1
she said if auto manufacturers did not comply she was in favor of forced measures			2
' the confusion surrounding this air bag defect has gone on for too long , ' she said			0
' today 's announcement is overdue but welcome , and it 's my hope that @entity10 and the other automakers that have n't yet done so will quickly agree to @entity9 's request - if they do n't , regulators should force a mandatory national recall			2
' the ratcheting up of pressure on @entity10 comes ahead of a @entity167 hearing thursday at which top officials from @entity10 , @entity85 and @entity96 are scheduled to testify on the defect , blamed for several deaths and numerous injuries in the @entity1 and elsewhere			0
@entity30 will also testify , with the agency facing growing calls to explain why recalls so far have been limited to only several @entity1 states			0
@entity19 firm @entity5 -- subject of a @entity1 criminal investigation into its exploding air bags -- has been asked to provide documents and other information on the propellant used in its deadly air bags in contrast , about 16 million cars worldwide from 10 automakers have been recalled over the defect			1
last month , in its initial warning , the @entity9 said that motorists in warm - weather @entity1 states should take ' urgent ' action because the air bags were thought to have a greater risk of rupturing in cars operated in areas with high humidity			1
in tuesday 's statement , the agency stuck by its view that cars in warm , humid climates are most likely to suffer the problem			0
it said : ' while @entity9 is not aware of either field incidents or test data suggesting that the problem affecting passenger - side air bags in the areas of persistently high humidity extends beyond those areas , the agency has been pushing the industry to perform testing to ensure that current recalls effectively cover vehicles with air bags that could be potentially affected by this defect			2
' auto safety advocates and lawmakers said @entity9 's latest move may still not capture the scope of the problem , is too late , and may not be enforceable			0
@entity223 senators @entity221 and @entity224 said they were pleased @entity9 recognized the ' national scope ' of the problem , ' but said the call to replace driver - side air bags should be expanded to also include passenger air bags .			1

@entity9 said previous recall limited to southern states must be expanded
it ordered @entity10 to provide information on propellant used in the inflators
the air bags can rupture upon deployment , shooting shrapnel into the car
five fatalities , including four in the @entity243 , have been linked to the airbags

she said if manufacturers do not comply she supports forced measures
