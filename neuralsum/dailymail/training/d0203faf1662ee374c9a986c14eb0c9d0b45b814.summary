by @entity0 back in control : @entity2 has learned to overcome her panic attacks through the therapy @entity2 has suffered from anxiety since she was a teenager – a constant worry that can leave her light - headed , shaky and exhausted			1
now aged 22 , she had her first panic attack at 17 and has spent years trying to overcome her overwhelming feelings			2
today , after two courses of cognitive behavioural therapy – the standard @entity12 treatment for anxiety – proved ineffective , @entity2 is finally being helped by a new type of psychological intervention : compassion focused therapy ( @entity18 )			1
inspired by @entity19 , @entity18 was conceived 30 years ago by professor @entity20 , a clinical psychologist for @entity21			1
it is now being offered as a therapy option at a number of @entity12 hospitals			1
sessions can be either for individuals and last about 50 minutes , or be 90 - minute group discussions			0
‘ it ’s similar to @entity30 , which works by helping patients to consider their negative thoughts and come to more realistic alternative views , ’ says prof @entity20			0
‘ but while @entity30 focuses on changing behaviour in a neutral , practical way – such as using timesheets to plan the day more productively – in @entity18 the focus is more on being kind to yourself			1
’ sessions have three elements : encouraging patients to do activities or make changes that are kind to themselves , such as writing to a friend ; helping them focus on seeing the good in other people and their own lives rather than the negative aspects ; and getting the patient to speak out loud to themselves in a kind , warm tone			0
‘ our brains naturally focus on the negative , ’ says prof @entity20			0
‘ for example , if we go shopping and in nine shops the assistants are extremely helpful but in one shop the assistant is very rude , we focus on the latter and lose sight of the positive experiences			0
‘ deliberately training our attention to notice kindness in others can be very helpful , which @entity18 does			1
’ through tackling the self - criticism and replacing it with kindness , patients then judge themselves and their lives less harshly and therefore feel happier			0
‘ by helping people feel compassion , we believe you can create a positive physiological change in your body – just like imagining a delicious dinner will stimulate saliva and appetite , ’ continues prof @entity20			2
‘ @entity30 is primarily focused on thinking and behaviour change but @entity18 looks at the emotion behind people ’s thoughts			1
’ kind words : in compassion focused therapy ( @entity18 ) the focus is on being kind to yourself and encouraging positivity @entity18 therapist @entity87 adds : ‘ it is a relatively new therapy but we are working hard to show that this approach has something important to offer			1
‘ so far there has been one successful randomised control trial of @entity18 which found a reduction in symptoms in patients with depression			1
’ up to 30 per cent of the population suffers anxiety at any one time			2
last month a report from the @entity101 said young women are more anxious than young men , while growing numbers of middle - aged women are suffering chronic anxiety – females aged over 60 are the most likely group to need hospital treatment for the condition			1
‘ my anxiety started on a night out with friends when we were on holiday in @entity116 , ’ says @entity2 , a personal assistant from @entity111			1
‘ i felt suddenly overwhelmed by panic and i ended up walking back to our apartment alone and then was up all night in absolute bits trying to calm myself down			0
‘ i ended up getting in the shower every hour to cool down and i had no one to speak to , which made it ten times worse			0
‘ it was so terrifying i flew home early from the holiday , and afterwards i was always really nervous that i ’d have another panic attack somewhere far from home with nobody there to comfort me			0
’ following that trip , @entity2 ’s attacks became regular , happening once or twice a month			2
they lasted about ten minutes each time and left her upset and exhausted			0
her gp referred her for two courses of @entity30 , but the anxiety persisted			2
‘ it sounds silly , but i could n’t stop worrying about my cat during the day – thoughts about her getting run over			0
whatever the trigger , i feel light - headed and shaky , my stomach churns and for a moment it ’s a bit like i ’m having a panic attack			0
’ @entity2 heard about @entity18 through her volunteer work at a mental health charity and , hoping to eliminate her anxiety , she booked a course of six sessions with a private therapist			1
@entity2 says : ‘ @entity30 had helped with my generalised anxiety but i preferred @entity18 because it involved more talking and delving into things like my childhood			1
i ’m usually quite hard on myself so it ’s taught me to be kinder , which has really helped			2
‘ now when i ’m on my own and start to feel panic , i am more gentle on myself , so instead of panicking i sort of talk myself round with comfort			0
i now know that the anxiety i feel is not my fault			2
for the first time in years i have found a way to calm down rather than wind myself up still further			0

@entity2 , 22 , from @entity111 has suffered from anxiety since her teens
