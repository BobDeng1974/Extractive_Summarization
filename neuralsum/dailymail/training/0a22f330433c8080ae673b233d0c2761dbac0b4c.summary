over the past decade , we women have gone to great pains to avoid the cardinal sin of looking too ‘ matchy - matchy ’			1
confidently clashing colours and patterns , skilfully contrasting wool with leather — there is an art to stylishly mixing and layering clothes			0
this season , forget all of that , as designers fill stores with perfectly matching separates : top - and - skirt sets and top - and - trouser combos			1
the head - to - toe effect is that of a layered dress , or a jumpsuit			0
experts are calling it an update on the twinset			0
and we ’re not just talking about toning colours , co-ordinates , or smart suits ; we ’re talking @entity30 , from double denim at @entity32 ( where the @entity34 utility trousers , £ 195 , are teamed with a matching shirt for £ 145 ) , to a monochrome set at @entity37 ( top , £ 165 , trousers , £ 165 ) , and a bright print top , £ 18 , and trousers , £ 22 , by @entity42 at over- 50s clothing website @entity44			1
this @entity46 skirt and top is a more subtle and sophisticated take on the new twosie trend retailers are saying these ‘ twosies ’ will be this season ’s biggest trend , following the recent success of onesies			1
‘ matching separates are a really strong trend for autumn and winter , ’ says top fashion stylist @entity56 , who works with brands including @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			1
‘ on the catwalks , at @entity64 and @entity65 especially , they looked very polished			0
’ of course , what you immediately notice about these outfits is that the cost quickly adds up			0
the @entity72 set comes in at £ 40 , whereas a jumpsuit from the same range is £ 30			0
@entity46 has a subtly printed blue dress for £ 129 , but the top and skirt come to £ 196 — though , in this case , the top , at least , is silk			0
and while a @entity34 jumpsuit from @entity32 is £ 245 , the top - and - trousers set costs £ 340			1
neoprene top , £ 79 , and a-line midi skirt , £ 89 , by @entity87 , one of the ' twosies ' hitting the high street whether it ’s catwalk or high street , the story is the same : @entity93 ’s beautiful brocade top and skirt come to £ 1,535 , while a dress in a similar jacquard is £ 1,050			1
so , is this the reason we ’re being sold what is , after all , a @entity101 throwback ? are retailers trying to get us to spend twice as much ? fashion experts insist it is n’t as calculated as that			2
‘ it ’s not a conspiracy on the part of the fashion industry to try to get everyone to stop buying single pieces such as dresses , ’ says @entity107 , editor - in - chief of trends analyst @entity108			1
‘ often , as trend cycles go , you ’ll have a dress period , and then a separates period — that ’s just how it goes			1
and , do n’t forget , even if you buy matching separates , you do n’t have to wear them together			1
’ a range of twosies are already available from patterned tops to subtle skirt combos indeed , while retailers may benefit from multiple buys , the customer wins , too , in a number of ways			2
first , of course , there is only one way to wear a dress or jumpsuit — while separates offer a multitude of options			0
even a distinctive set , such as the floral cotton shell top , £ 59 , and full skirt , £ 89 , from @entity144 by @entity145 , together create a charmingly autumnal ensemble , but can easily be mixed and matched with other items of clothing			2
second , if you are one of the millions of women who find it difficult to shop for dresses and jumpsuits as you take different sizes on the upper and lower parts of your body , you can get the look more easily using separates			0
take @entity161 ’s @entity160 shell top , £ 59 , and a-line skirt , £ 69 , which together look every bit the party dress			2
simply match a pair of black , silk evening trousers with a top in the same fabric for an instant jumpsuit that fits perfectly			0
‘ @entity173 has designed a great black trousersuit with matching jewelled top for her @entity59 winter collection that would work perfectly for @entity178 drinks parties — a great alternative to the classic cocktail dress , ’ says @entity172			1
‘ this combination offers the consumer brilliant value for money , working as a total look , or by teaming the top with jeans and the trousers with a classic , white shirt			2
’ perhaps the greatest strength of this trend , though , is that it so neatly straddles both formal and casual styles			2
@entity87 ’s neoprene top , £ 79 , and midi skirt , £ 89 , are a perfect example			0
individually , they are relaxed , sporty styles ; but , together , and co-ordinated with a jacket and smart shoes , they look polished enough for the office			0
with designers such as @entity204 showing matching separates for @entity205 2015 collections , it ’s clearly not a trend that ’s going anywhere any time soon .			1
