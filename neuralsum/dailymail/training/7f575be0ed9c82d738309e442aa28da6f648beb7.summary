@entity12 and @entity13 saw the 8ft animal and saved it by pulling the moose out of its mouth			1
big bite : the @entity6 shark was found choking to death in a harbour in @entity10 , @entity11 mr @entity12 was the first to arrive at the scene and first thought the @entity6 shark was a beached whale			1
