@entity0 had struggled with ' every single diet there is ' for years , watching her weight bob up and down and never understanding why she always felt so tired and bloated			1
a chance visit to an @entity5 after injuring her back revealed her symptoms as ' acidic ' , and she was put on a two - week eating plan of oily fish , green tea , whole grains , green vegetables and almonds			2
she cut out fizzy drinks ( including soda water and tonic ) , sugar , sweeteners , peanuts , white flours and chocolate - and in under a year she lost two stone and shrunk by two dress sizes			0
@entity0 , founder of @entity25 , whose celebrity clients include @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 four years later , @entity0 - who is @entity29 's step - sister - now runs the @entity25 food company with her godmother , nutritionist @entity31 , delivering home - cooked alkaline meals to celebrities including @entity26 , @entity35 , @entity28 , @entity27 and swimwear designer @entity36			1
@entity37 has called her food ' healthy yet ridiculously delicious ' , and @entity36 has said : ' i can eat tillmy hearts content and still look great in my bikinis ! " and now @entity0 and @entity43 's new book , @entity25 : eat with your body in mind , @entity44 ' , has received online praise from @entity49 who tweeted her love for the recipe bible earlier this month			1
speaking to @entity52 , @entity0 said : ' the thing we really want to stress as much as possible is that this is not a diet - it 's a healthy way of eating			1
the whole reason for creating it was to get out of faddy diets			0
' the alkaline eating plan is about getting your body into the optimum state it can be in - and alkaline is healthier than acidic			1
' when your body is alkaline you have clear skin , greater concentration , shiny hair - all the things you want with the bonus of weight loss			0
' honestly @entity25 , @entity0 and @entity31 's first alkaline cookbook did you know that a lemon when digested is alkaline ? and that cows milk when digested is acidic ? but when tested on the ph scale both are the opposite ? food groups behave differently in the body – some provide energy ( carbohydrates ) , whilst others are the very rebuilding and repairing blocks of our bodies and brains ( proteins ) – and yet others feed our neurological systems , regulate our hormones , and protect us against damage and disease ( essential fats )			1
how these foods behave in the body is broken down into two classes – acid and alkaline			0
our bodies function best when in an overall alkaline state , @entity101 and yet much of our current eating trends and diets are very acid - forming in the body , leading to internal stress on the digestive and other systems			2
our bodies do amazing things with food – its our fuel , so why feed it with something that does n’t make it perform at its optimum ? here at @entity25 we want to show you how to feel at your best all the time without compromising on taste and all those treats			1
from @entity117 the basis of @entity25 is that you stick to alkaline foods - green vegetables , almonds , garlic , olive oil , lemons , tea - and cut out acidic foods such as oats , milk , chicken and rhubarb			2
' but only 70 per cent of the time , ' assures @entity0			2
' the idea is that it 's a lifestyle , not a diet , so you follow the rules only 70 per cent of the time			0
30 per cent of the time you can eat normal , gluten pizza , chocolate and wine			0
everyone needs to have a life and go to the pub now and then ! ' the best thing is that when you do go back to eating all these things 30 per cent of the time , you wo n't feel as good as when you do n't eat them at all			0
which means you therefore eat them less and the weight falls of naturally			0
' the @entity25 website , where you can learn about alkaline eating , buy treats for your larder or sign up for @entity0 's food delivery service @entity26 and @entity49 are both fans of the alkaline diet , @entity26 has called her food ' healthy yet ridiculously delicious '			1
