a robot that can print itself new ' body ' parts and adapt to environments has been made			1
in a video , the machine is shown struggling - but succeeding - to crawl along the ground after having one of its four limbs removed			2
and it could herald future robots that can learn how to overcome difficult conditions on other worlds like @entity14			1
scientists at @entity16 have created robots that learn to adapt			1
the multi-limbed machines can overcome environmental challenges			1
in a video a robot with a limb removed learns how to walk ( shown ) the robots were created by a team of scientists from the @entity16			1
to make them a 3d printer is fed a list of parameters for the robots including desired speed , size and efficiency			1
a simulator then pits several different creations in ' fights to the death ' before the winning robot is sent to the 3d printer for production			1
the robot was then ' taught ' that it was missing a limb and told to try and walk across the floor			2
in the video it can be seen how the robot adapts to its situation , and still manages to ' walk ' or rawl across the floor			2
the 3d printers used by the university cost up to Â£ 280,000 ( $ 430,000 ) and are capable of an extremely high level of precision			0

to make them a 3d printer is fed a list of parameters for the robots including desired speed , size and efficiencies			1
a simulator then pits several different creations with different limbs and features in ' fights to the death ' before selecting a winner robots of the future wo n't just be smart , they could also have ninja - like reflexes			2
researchers in the @entity73 are studying the way cats and athletes rotate their body mid-air , and hope to recreate that movement in droids			0
the aim is to reduce the impact on falling robots - especially those that may one day be used for search - and - rescue missions in hazardous conditions			0
professor @entity86 at @entity87 has been simulating the physics of everything from falling cats to the mid-air orientation of divers and astronauts			0
the study involved using a small robot consisting of a main body and two symmetric legs with paddles			0
according to @entity101 , the potential benefits of such a robot are numerous			0
for example , a @entity14 rover equipped with a 3d printer could autonomously get itself out of sticky situations			1
' in the future , robots must be able to solve tasks in deep mines on distant planets , in radioactive disaster areas , in hazardous landslip areas and on the sea bed beneath the @entity114 , ' said professor @entity115 , from the robotics and @entity118 research group			2
' these environments are so extreme that no human being can cope			0
everything needs to be automatically controlled			0
' imagine that the robot is entering the wreckage of a nuclear power plant			0
it finds a staircase that no - one has thought of			0
' the robot takes a picture			0
the arms of one of the robots is fitted with a printer			2
' this produces a new robot , or a new part for the existing robot , which enables it to negotiate the stairs			0
' the research team ( shown with some of the robots ) say that the technique of autonomously creating parts could be used by future robots on other planets in the solar system			1

scientists at @entity16 have created robots that learn to adapt
the multi-limbed machines can overcome environmental challenges
in a video a robot with a limb removed learns how to walk on the ground
the robots can also learn to use a 3d printer to create new parts
future robots could use the technique to print new parts on others planets such as @entity14
