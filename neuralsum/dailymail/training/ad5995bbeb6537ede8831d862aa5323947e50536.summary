@entity0 is to captain @entity1 in the absence of @entity4 after being promoted to the vice-captaincy by @entity6			2
@entity0 will lead the side for the remainder of the @entity9 against @entity10 after @entity4 was ruled out with a hamstring injury suffered in the opening @entity12 in @entity13 earlier this week , and his promotion could yet prove to be permanent , with @entity4 himself suggesting that this latest in a long list of injury problems leaves his future in the game uncertain			1
the 25 - year - old @entity0 got the nod ahead of the current vice-captain @entity20 , who will serve as his deputy when the second test begins in @entity23 on wednesday , and the decision to go with the younger man may reveal the extent of concern over the 33 - year - old @entity4 's future			1
' what we do know is that it wo n't be an overnight fix so after a lot of thought we have taken the opportunity to appoint an emerging young leader as captain until such time as @entity4 regains fitness and returns to the side			0
' we congratulate @entity56 on the wonderful honour of leading his country			0
on wednesday he will become @entity1 's 45th @entity12 captain and at the age of 25 will become one of our youngest leaders			0
he is an exceptional young man who is highly regarded by the @entity63 not only for his fine performances with the bat but also his maturity and clear leadership potential			0
' the 25 - year - old all - rounder has been rewarded for his maturity and is seen as a long - term captain @entity4 's latest injury comes after he made a century in @entity13 , and could keep him out for a while the @entity73 captain left the field with a hamstring injury to follow on from his back complaint @entity4 is unsure whether he will be able to play @entity12 again after his latest injury at 37 , @entity20 's age counted against him with @entity6 keen to take a long view			1
' @entity20 has done an exceptional job as vice-captain since assuming the role last year and will provide strong support to @entity56 just as he has done for @entity4 , ' @entity37 added			2
' there was a strong argument for @entity20 to assume the captaincy until @entity4 returns , but given we do n't know how long that will be , we felt the time was right to take a longer - term view and give a young player this chance			2
' @entity0 shakes hands with @entity20 , who was overlooked because of his age and remains vice-captain @entity0 , who has captaincy experience with @entity96 and the @entity97 , has emerged as a leading batsman in 23 test appearances for @entity1 , having initially made the grade as a leg - spinner who could contribute with the bat			1
he had unbeaten innings of 162 and 52 in the 48 - run victory over @entity10 , lifting his @entity12 average to 46.03 .			0

@entity0 , 25 , will lead @entity1 in @entity108 against @entity10
@entity4 could be forced to retire after latest injury
@entity20 , the current vice-captain , overlooked because of his age as selectors look for long - term *solution*
