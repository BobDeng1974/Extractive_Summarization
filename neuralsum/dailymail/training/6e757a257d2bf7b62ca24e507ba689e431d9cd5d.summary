two teachers who were fired from a @entity2 high school in 2009 after an alleged lesbian tryst in a classroom are getting their jobs back after an appeals court in @entity7 ruled in their favor in a decision handed down thursday			1
@entity10 , a 34 - year - old @entity11 teacher at @entity13 ’s @entity12 , was caught half naked in a classroom , ' kneeling between the legs ' of a topless fellow teacher , an independent arbitrator found			1
@entity17 and her alleged lover , 32 - year - old @entity19 teacher @entity18 , had vehemently denied allegations of a ' lesbian lovefest			1
' the 34 - year - old claimed that she was only helping @entity18 deal with her diabetes by bringing her some candy to raise her blood glucose levels			2
disgraced teachers @entity18 ( left ) and @entity10 are allowed to teach again following an appeal after being fired for ' lesbian tryst ' even if the allegations of sexual misconduct are true , the five - judge @entity30 ruled that firing the two women was ' shockingly disproportionate to ( their ) misconduct			1
' ' while ( @entity18 ’s ) behavior demonstrated a lapse in judgment , there is no evidence that this incident was anything but a one - time mistake , ' the panel ruled			2
in their decision , the justices ruled that even if the reports are true , ' consensual sexual contact ' was not grounds to fire them			2
the justices also noted the ' unblemished disciplinary records ' of each teacher , as well as their ' consistently satisfactory teacher ratings			0
' in @entity18 's case , her supervisor once described her as ' one of the best teachers she had ever worked with , ' according to the report , first obtained by the @entity60			1
the court sent the case back to city education officials with instructions to impose a less - severe penalty			0
sine the allegations first arose - on the word of a janitor who claimed he saw the two women engaged in sexual activity - both teachers denied they were ever naked , alleging that the custodian who walked in on them during a school talent show had a vivid imagination			1
the two women were language teachers at @entity12 in @entity2 the scandal earned the school a suggestive nickname : @entity79			1
lawyers representing the city said in court documents that the teachers ’ alibi was hard to believe because no medical equipment was found in @entity86 , where the pair allegedly was busted			1
the city also pointed out that @entity18 and @entity17 had climbed six flights of stairs before arriving at their destination , passing multiple classrooms and more than one bathroom — unlikely behavior for someone suffering from low blood sugar			2
judge @entity98 apparently agreed , upholding an arbitrator ’s decision in 2012 to fire @entity17 as ‘ rational and with plausible basis			1
’ bad press : the alleged affair earned the school the unflattering nickname ' @entity79 ' the ruling came less than two weeks after another judge allowed @entity18 to return to the classroom after she had successfully sued the @entity109			1
judge @entity111 wrote in her opinion that @entity18 's punishment was ‘ excessive and shockingly severe , ’ the @entity110 reported			1
‘ we have children who are deprived of a first - class , caring teacher , and a teacher who , due to one sensational , publicly exploited incident where she exhibited extremely poor judgment , is deprived of continuing a career she loves and excels at			0
‘ that is not a good balance , in the opinion of this court			0
in fact , the imbalance is shockingly bad , ’ @entity111 wrote			0
the judge criticized the city for destroying a surveillance tape supposedly documenting the act , which she said had deprived the teacher of due process			0
denial : @entity18 and @entity17 claim nothing inappropriate went on and that witnesses let their imaginations get the best of them @entity18 ’s lawyers claimed it was a crucial piece of evidence that could prove witness accounts to be false			0
the married teacher was fired in january , 2012 , following the release of a report that claimed @entity17 had lured her away from a student song - and - dance competition with promises of sugar and candy			0
in her lawsuit , @entity18 claimed that the account of the witness to the events was not reliable because he never entered the classroom and a 300 - pound janitor was blocking his view through a small opening in the door			2
' there were no shenanigans , ' said her lawyer @entity166			0
' he sees through this other custodian , who 's 6 ' 4 " or 6 ' 5 " , and sees a partially naked body lying on the floor			0
' doubt : school officials find it hard to believe the pair walked up six flights of stairs to treat a diabetic 's blood - sugar problem @entity180 offered a much more innocent version of events , claiming : ' upon immediately entering the classroom , @entity18 's knees buckled , at which point @entity18 laid down off to the right but at the foot of the classroom door			1
' @entity17 assisted @entity18 by placing @entity18 's sweater under her head and elevated her legs in a chair			2
@entity17 also obtained a couple of sugar packets from her desk and gave them to @entity18			0
' it 's unclear when - or if - the women will be returning to their jobs at @entity12 .			0

the two language teachers were fired in 2012 over an alleged lesbian tryst in a classroom
@entity10 and @entity18 deny there was any such tryst
the pair appealed the school 's decision to fire them
judges in the appeal found firing the two women to be ' shockingly disproportionate ' to their alleged misconduct
