when @entity1 walked out of today 's farcical ‘ yellow budget ’ speech , it prompted relentless jeers from @entity5 - and left @entity6 speaking to a virtually - empty chamber			1
and , to add insult to injury , the deputy prime minister 's swift exit appeared to be for the sole purpose of trying his hand at a spot of am - dram in @entity16			1
as these pictures show , the @entity17 leader was this afternoon seen sauntering around @entity19 , taking selfies with residents and high - fiving passers - by as part of a ' fun ' film shoot for a party political broadcast			1
there were even reports that he interacted with dancing girls for the film			0
at one point , mr @entity1 opted for an outfit swap , changing into a camel - coloured jacket , which he matched with a more severe facial expression , as he walked solo along the high street			1
perhaps unsurprisingly , the political broadcast is not the first time that mr @entity1 has attempted some amateur acting			1
the politician is said to have enjoyed am - dram at school , taking the lead role in @entity70 while at @entity71			2
at @entity72 , he took the lead in @entity74 , opposite @entity76 actress in - the - making @entity75			0
in one scene , she had to kick him between the legs - and one night she hit the target rather too authentically			0
' she got it spot on … no acting was required , ' @entity1 recalls			0
he also once donned a purple velvet jacket to play @entity83 in @entity85 's @entity84 - a man who boasts about his sexual conquests			0
woollen : wearing woolly gloves , an open - neck shirt and a v - neck sweater , mr @entity1 looked right at home swap : he even opted for an outfit change halfway through filming , reverting to a camel - coloured jacket strutting his stuff : mr @entity1 is a seasoned amateur actor and took the lead role in @entity70 while at @entity71 speaking to @entity99 about today 's filming , mr @entity1 said : ' it 's a bit of fun			1
i want to have fun in this general election campaign			0
i do n't want it to be too po - faced and serious			1
' asked why the party decided to shoot the video in @entity16 , he added : ' it was just a really great place to do this and hopefully not cause too much disruption			2
' everybody in the shops here have been really warm and really generous with their time			0
' a @entity17 source said : ' we were filming bits of a party political broadcast and other videos that are going to be used in the campaign			2
' the whole crew has been filming for a couple of days – @entity1 was there for a couple of hours today			2
' but you 'll just have to wait and see what 's in them			0
