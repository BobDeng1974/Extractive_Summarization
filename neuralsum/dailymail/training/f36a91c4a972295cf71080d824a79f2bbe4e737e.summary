but according to the latest @entity43 for 2014/15 , this is also two less than last year			0
and universities in @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 have made inroads this year while @entity49 has two more institutions in the the top 200			2
experts say the rankings are evidence of a ' power shift ' from @entity24 to @entity5 with many @entity26 universities ' starved of vital public funding ' and ' losing ground '			1
three @entity1 institutions have fallen out of the top 200 - @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 , according to the rankings , while @entity63 makes a first appearance , moving into 196th place			1
@entity17 has four universities in the top 40 - more than any other city in the world , and a total of seven in the top 200 - the same number as @entity72 , and more than @entity73 , @entity45 , @entity74 and @entity47 , the rankings say			1
these are - @entity76 ( 9th ) , @entity77 ( @entity77 ) ( 22nd ) , @entity78 ( @entity78 ) ( 34th ) , @entity79 ( @entity79 ) ( 40th ) , @entity80 , @entity81 ( 107th ) , @entity82 , @entity81 ( 118th ) @entity63 ( 196th )			0
while some @entity1 universities have slipped down the rankings , including @entity77 , @entity18 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity85 , others have risen , such as @entity76 , @entity19 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			1
@entity18 ( pictured ) , has slipped down the global rankings from second to third the rankings rate universities worldwide on 13 measures including teaching , research and international outlook - such as numbers of overseas students and staff			2
in first place overall was the @entity102 in the @entity41 , holding on to the top spot for the fourth year running			0
@entity104 was second and @entity18 took third place , down one from joint second last year			0

two of these - @entity116 and the @entity117 - are in the top 25			0
@entity118 , editor of the rankings , said : ' @entity113 's top universities continue their strong upward movement in the rankings , on the back of strong government financial support , strong leadership and a strong commitment to excellence in higher education and research			1
' he added : ' at the same time , many @entity26 universities , in many cases starved of vital public funding , are losing ground			0
' there is much talk of a power shift from @entity24 to @entity5 , but these new world university rankings provide hard evidence of the phenomenon			1
' there is little doubt that key @entity113 nations have emerged as powerhouses in global higher education and research , while traditional leaders including the @entity1 , @entity148 and the @entity41 , risk losing significant ground in the global knowledge economy			2
' mr @entity118 said that the @entity1 is continuing to ' punch above its weight ' on the rankings , with elite universities still highly competitive			2
a number of @entity1 's top universities have slipped in the global rankings but the nation still has 29 institutions in the top 200 - more than any other country except the @entity41			1
the @entity1 universities in this year 's top 200 are shown below with last year 's ranking in brackets			1
@entity18 - 3rd place ( 2 ) @entity19 - 5th ( 7 ) @entity76 - 9th ( 10 ) @entity77 - 22nd ( 21 ) @entity78 - 34th ( 32 ) @entity87 - 36th ( 39 ) @entity164 , pictured , has gone up two places in the global rankings from seventh to fifth @entity79 - 40th ( 38 ) @entity88 - 52nd ( 58 ) @entity89 - 74th ( 79 ) @entity85 - 83rd ( 80 ) @entity90 - 94th ( 117 ) @entity168 - 103rd ( 141 ) @entity169 - 107 ( 114 ) @entity170 - 111th ( 117 ) @entity171 - 111th ( 121 ) @entity172 - 113rd ( 100 ) @entity76 , pictured , is another @entity1 institution to have crept up the global pecking order @entity82 - 118th ( 102 ) @entity174 - 121st ( 112 ) @entity175 - 131st ( 137 ) @entity176 - 132nd ( 146 ) @entity177 - 146th ( 139 ) @entity178 - 148th ( 153 ) @entity179 - 154th ( 148 ) @entity180 - 157th ( 169 ) @entity181 - 171st ( 157 ) @entity182 - 178th ( 188 ) @entity63 - 196th ( 201 - 225 ) @entity183 - 198th ( 174 ) @entity184 - 199th ( 161 ) but he warned : ' overall , the @entity1 's representation among the world 's leading universities is declining - three leading names fell out of the top 200 this year , and two others occupy 198th and 199th place			1
five @entity1 universities lost their top 400 places			0
' this loss of power and influence is not good for the @entity1 's overall competitiveness in the global knowledge economy			2
' also , the @entity1 's power is increasingly concentrated in the @entity202 of @entity203 - the five top @entity1 institutions in the world are all from the @entity202 ' golden triangle ' of @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity17			1
' indeed , of the nine @entity203 universities in the world top 100 , six are from @entity17 and the @entity202			0
' professor @entity207 , president of @entity76 , said : ' one need only look across the campuses of universities in the top ranks of these league tables to see that great education by definition is global , with brilliant students flocking to them from all corners of the world			0
' they are attracted to the likes of @entity76 , not only because of the opportunities created by excellent teaching and research , but also because of the thriving intellectual and entrepreneurial atmosphere on offer			0
' at @entity76 , about half of our students come from outside the @entity1 , as do almost as many of our academics			0
their presence creates ties that span disciplines , cross national boundaries and endure for lifetimes			0
' just as students benefit from a university environment that represents the global spectrum of cultures and values , so does research : it is interesting that such a fiercely competitive endeavour benefits so greatly from international collaboration , essential to building the best and most competitive research teams			0
' we compete better when we collaborate effectively with our competitors , and quality and impact rise			0

a number of the @entity1 's top universities have fallen in a global league table
the slip in rankings comes amid fierce competition from overseas
experts say it could be evidence of a ' power shift ' from the @entity24 to the @entity262
@entity265 's centres of excellence are in ' golden triangle ' of @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19
@entity1 has 29 institutions in top 200 , more than any other country except @entity41
