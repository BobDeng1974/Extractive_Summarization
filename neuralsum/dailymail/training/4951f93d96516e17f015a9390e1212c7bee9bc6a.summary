by @entity1 reporter @entity2 has become the first @entity4 country to recognise ' indeterminate sex ' by allowing babies born with characteristics of both sexes to be registered as neither male nor female			1
the new regulation , which takes effect from today , stems from a study by the @entity14 into intersexuality that concluded that the rights of intersex individuals against irreversible medical interventions should be better protected			1
@entity2 passports , which currently bear an 'm ' for male or ' f ' for female , will soon be allowed to have an ' x ' in the gender field , according to a spokesman for the interior ministry			1
' if a child can not be designated male or female , then they should be entered on the birth register without such a status , ' the new law states			0
born without sex : according to 2007 government figures , at least 150 intersex babies are born in @entity2 each year and 8,000 to 10,000 people have ' serious variations ' from physical gender - defining characteristics according to 2007 government figures , at least 150 intersex babies are born in @entity2 each year and 8,000 - 10,000 people have ' serious variations ' from physical gender - defining characteristics			1
' this will be the first time that the law acknowledges that there are human beings who are neither male nor female , or are both - people who do not fit into the traditional legal categories , ' @entity44 law professor @entity43 told @entity54			2
support groups say the number of intersex individuals is far higher than government estimates , and point out the difficulties and subtleties of defining intersexuality physically or hormonally			2
' we will have fellow human beings with no sex registered , ' @entity43 said			0
' they ca n't be forced into either one of the traditional sexes in these other contexts			0
' creating a third gender would complicate @entity2 laws on marriages and partnerships , which operate on a binary male - female opposition , although the @entity14 would examine the implications for intersex individuals , he added			1
' this is an interesting move but it does n't go far enough , ' said @entity77 , policy director at the @entity79 - based rights group @entity78 for lesbian , gay , bisexual , trans and intersex people in @entity4 ( @entity84 )			1
concerns : a more immediate concern for intersex advocates is how children ' outed ' at birth will fare in a world that operates largely on a gender binary ' unnecessary surgeries will likely continue in @entity2 with devastating consequences ... we live in a world where having a baby classified as ' other ' is still considered undesirable			1
' a more immediate concern for intersex advocates , he said , is how children ' outed ' at birth will fare in a world that operates largely on a gender binary			1
' schools have toilets for boys and toilets for girls			0
where will the intermediate child go ? ' added mr @entity77			0
' there are separate sports activities for boys and for girls , and so many other things like this , ' @entity77 said			0
' the law does n't change that			0
it does not immediately create a space for intersex people to be themselves			1
' experts estimate the population of intersex people at one in 1,500 to 2,000 births			1
but advocates say the number is much larger partly due to difficulties in defining intersexuality physically or hormonally			2
the new law has already raised the profile of this small population , which could prompt increased awareness , but , some fear , could also trigger discrimination			0
' it is an absolute must that parents , teachers and doctors be educated about the lives of intersex people , ' said @entity143 , head of an intersex support group in @entity2			1
' the government must take measures to ensure that no children are discriminated against because of this new law			2
' a 2012 report from the @entity14 quoted the case of an individual born in 1965 with no clear gender - defining genitalia but with testicles in their abdomen and male chromosomes			2
at the age of 2.5 months the individual was castrated without parental consent , a move which doctors later called a mistake			0
' i 'm not a man , nor a woman ... i remain a patchwork , made from doctors , injured and scarred			0
i have to reinvent myself if i want to continue to live , ' the individual said			0
@entity166 has allowed citizens to note their gender on a passport as ' x ' since 2011 .			0

@entity2 passports will be able to have ' x ' in gender field rather than 'm ' or ' f '
it comes after study called for better protection of rights of intersex people
figures show at least 150 intersex babies are born in @entity2 each year
but advocates are concerned over how ' outed ' children will fare at school
