they have plagued feet for centuries , but only now have physicists revealed what causes ingrown nails			2
experts have come up with the first mathematical formulae that describe how human nails grow			1
they have discovered that ingrown toenails are caused when the forces holding nails in place , and their rate of growth , become unbalanced			1
experts have come up with mathematical formulae that describe how nails grow			1
these graphs show how the tilt of the nail changes when the adhesive molecules are not working efficiently ( c ) , the probability that a bond is not keeping up with nail growth ( @entity25 ) and a representation of the force generated by a nail ( e ) other factors , such as the thickness of the nail , biomechanical stress and the way people trim their nails , influences their chances of getting ingrown nails			1
the @entity40 study solves a long - running mystery about why ingrown nails occur			2
nails are made of dead skin cells , which are hardened by a protein called keratin			0
they grow outwards from the half - moon shaped ‘ lunala ’ at the base of the nail , but their progress of 0.1 to 0.2mm a day is kept in check by adhesive molecules that ‘ stick ’ the nail to the finger , @entity47 reported			0
they have discovered that ingrown toenails are caused when the forces holding nails in place , and their rate of growth , become unbalanced			1
when this happens , a nail becomes wider at the top and curls round into the sensitive flesh to either side of the nail			0
big toenails are prone to becoming ingrown because of their shape scientists looked at the mechanical stresses and energies associated with the nail , to come up with equations to explain nail growth			2
they show that when the balance between the nail ’s growth stress and adhesive stress is broken – if a nail grows too quickly or slowly , or the number of adhesive structures changes – a residual stress across the entire nail can occur , causing it to change shape over time			0
the equations demonstrate that residual stress can occur in any fingernail or toenail ; however , the stress is greater for nails that are larger in size and have a flatter edge , which explains why ingrown toe nails predominantly occur in the big toe			0
experts say that the tiny , microscopic structures , which allow the nail to slide forwards , grow in a ‘ ratchet - like ’ fashion by continuously binding and unbinding to a nail			0
if the balance between adhesion and growth becomes unbalanced , the nail changes shape , and can become ingrown or spoon - shaped , according to research published in the journal , @entity112			2
ingrown nails often occur in children , teenagers and pregnant women , when hormones cause a growth spurt of the nails , which extend into the sensitive flesh alongside them			2
@entity122 , lead author of the study at the @entity40 , said that big toenails are particularly prone to becoming ingrown because of their shape			0
scientists say that people should trim their nails in a ‘ parabola shape ’ to minimise their chance of getting ingrown nails			1
they warned that poor trimming can tip the fine balance of nails , causing residual stress to occur across the entire nail , making problems like ingrown nails more likely their squareness means stress caused by walking is diverted to the tip of the nail , which gets wider to spread the load			1
the scientist says that people should trim their nails in a ‘ parabola shape ’ to minimise their chance of getting ingrown nails			1
dr @entity122 warns that regular poor trimming can tip the fine balance of nails , causing residual stress to occur across the entire nail			0
‘ we suggest that nail beauty fanatics who trim their nails on a daily basis opt for straight or parabolic edges , as otherwise they may amplify the imbalance of stresses which could lead to a number of serious conditions , ’ he says .			0

scientists at the @entity40 have come up with the first mathematical formulae that describe how human nails grow
they say ingrown toenails are caused when the forces holding nails in place , and their rate of growth , become unbalanced
other factors , such as the thickness of the nail , biomechanical stress and the way people trim their nails , changes the odds of getting ingrown nails
experts advise people to trim their nails in a ' parabola shape '
