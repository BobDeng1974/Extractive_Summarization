by @entity0 published : 19:22 est , 18 march 2014 updated : 19:25 est , 18 march 2014 @entity2 has criticised the ' unacceptable ' figures , saying they should be a ' cause for alarm ' too many people are undergoing ' unnecessary ' leg amputations due to a lack of proper treatment , mps and peers have warned			1
a new report revealed a postcode lottery in the number of people losing legs for diseases including diabetes , with amputation twice as likely for those in the south west compared to those in @entity24			1
in 2012/2013 , there were almost 12,000 lower limb amputations in @entity28 , a figure the report said remains ' stubbornly high '			1
the new study from the @entity30 on @entity31 is based on @entity33 requests to @entity35 trusts and @entity35 clinical commissioning groups ( @entity36 )			2
it argued there is a lack of planning of how to treat patients at risk of lower limb disease , with @entity36 in areas without a dedicated patient pathway - a treatment plan agreed between departments - having 11 per cent more amputations on average than those with one			1
almost a third of @entity35 trusts handling vascular and diabetes patients did not have multi-disciplinary teams to manage care , despite evidence they produce better results			1
some 28 per cent of trusts also lacked the teams for peripheral arterial disease , a common condition in which fatty deposits in the arteries stop blood getting to leg muscles			0
@entity69 mp @entity2 said : ' too many patients are n't getting the treatment they need to avoid losing their legs			0
' the figures for parts of the south west of @entity28 are particularly alarming , and this needs to be tackled			2
' the unacceptably high level of lower limb amputations among people with diabetes in certain areas is a real cause for alarm			1
a new report says there were 12,00 lower body amputations on the @entity35 last year , a ' stubbornly high ' figure ' there clearly is a serious problem if some regions of @entity28 have much higher amputation rates than others			1
' the @entity30 on @entity31 , working with the country 's top experts in this field , recommends that the @entity96 make reducing lower limb - loss a major priority			2
' this is especially important given the country 's ageing population			0
' @entity101 , @entity102 policy manager , said : ' this report highlights the unacceptable variation of care across the @entity106 when it comes to diabetic foot care and amputation rates			0
' for someone with diabetes , getting the right foot care is essential			0
this includes having an annual foot check and being referred to a foot protection service if you are at increased risk of a foot attack			0
' up to 80 % of amputations are avoidable with good preventative footcare in the community and fast access to a specialist multidisciplinary team when needed			0
' @entity102 is calling on the @entity35 to ensure that people with diabetes and health care professionals recognise the importance of addressing acute foot care problems quickly and that there are services in place to ensure that people can access the right care at the right time			0

report shows there were 12,000 @entity35 lower limb amputations in 2012/13
study says figure for diabetes and vascular patients is ' stubbornly high '
those in south west twice as likely to have limb *removed* than @entity147
*researchers* say poor planning and lack of specialist teams is to blame
@entity157 brands ' unacceptable ' figure a ' cause for alarm ' and a ' serious problem '
