@entity0 could recall two @entity2 forwards to their starting line - up as they prepare to step into the path of a juggernaut at @entity6 on saturday — driven by @entity8 ’s ‘ big dudes ’ up front			1
@entity11 ’s team are bracing themselves for a fearsome onslaught in the latest instalment of ‘ @entity14 ’ as they aim to clinch the @entity16 title and there is a significant chance they could turn to hooker @entity19 and lock @entity20			1
lifted by their win over @entity25 in @entity26 on sunday , @entity23 ’s @entity22 side will come to @entity27 with a monster pack and orders to grind @entity31 ambition into the earth			1
yet the home forward unit , marshalled by @entity34 , have stood toe - to - toe with all - comers and trumped most rivals in recent years , even if their dominance of the close - quarters combat has not always brought the deserved results			2
@entity0 forward @entity41 described the @entity22 pack as ' big dudes ' along with @entity19 and @entity45 , flanker @entity44 is another established figure pushing hard for a place in the starting xv			1
one man who will be at the forefront of the home resistance is @entity52 lock @entity41 , whose comeback from injury against @entity55 was a resounding personal triumph			1
he was laid back on monday when considering the magnitude of a title decider			2
when asked about his @entity22 counterparts @entity60 and @entity61 , he said : ‘ they ’re big dudes			1
it ’ll be an interesting game			0
’ it will be interesting for those who relish a thunderous encounter and @entity41 is certainly in that category			1
he added : ‘ i ’ve played against many @entity22 sides			2
obviously we ’ve got to stay with them and show them they ca n’t just roll over us			0
then we can play some good rugby , get them moving around us and hopefully our fitness will tell come the end			0
’ @entity79 sets sights on @entity8 following @entity55 win @entity0 stepped up their preparations for their final @entity16 clash with @entity8 at @entity6 @entity84 passes the ball as the team practice at their headquarters in @entity88 @entity0 packs do n’t make a habit of bending the knee to any opponents at home			1
there is pride in their reputation and they will protect it with gusto			0
‘ we ’re not the biggest pack but we certainly bring physicality , ’ said @entity41			2
‘ we like the contact and i do n’t think we ’ve ever really been shoved around			0
we ’ve got a great pack , very dynamic , and we ’ve got a lot of different things we can do which is great			0
we certainly do n’t expect to get pushed around			0
‘ physicality is a massive part of the game for @entity22 sides and it ’s going to be a big challenge up front — something we ’ve got to match , at least			1
’ @entity114 passes the ball during @entity0 's training session at @entity117 in @entity118 @entity0 coach @entity11 oversees his team 's training session as they prepare for a @entity22 test @entity122 and @entity61 look on during @entity8 's clash with @entity25 in @entity26 @entity61 ( lock , 11 caps ) the @entity127 giant makes up for a relative lack of experience with his huge 6ft 9in , 18st 5lb frame			1
@entity60 ( lock , 35 caps ) at 6ft 7in , @entity133 is n’t as tall as his fellow lock , but the 27 - year - old has more caps and a 9lb weight advantage			0
@entity139 ( prop , 5 caps ) the heaviest of the lot , @entity141 - born @entity144 is 6ft 5in and tips the scale at a whopping 24st 6lb ! @entity147 is well aware of the heavyweight threat			0
many of the biggest visitors are likely to be substitutes unleashed in the second half in an attempt to blast through a tiring @entity0 defence — giants such as @entity156 ( 19st ) , @entity122 ( 20st ) and centre @entity157 ( 19st )			2
‘ they are a huge team ; very powerful and rely a lot on the bench at around 50 minutes — guys like ( @entity165 ) @entity164 and @entity156 , ’ said the head coach			0
‘ it will be interesting to see if @entity157 starts			0
he adds a huge physical presence to their back line			0
they are big and athletic			0
’ asked if @entity0 are equipped to withstand the battering , he added : ‘ yeah , i think so			2
’ @entity0 also need enough points to seal the title but will not worry about chasing elusive targets , at least initially			1
‘ if we start obsessing about the scoreline , then we ’re not going to win the game , ’ said @entity11 .			1

@entity11 's side beat @entity55 25 - 13 at @entity6 last saturday
@entity0 , @entity183 and @entity184 can all win the @entity16 title on saturday
