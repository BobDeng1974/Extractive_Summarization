by @entity0 published : 03:04 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 03:34 est , 12 june 2013 a ' safe play scheme ’ that encourages parents to apply for their street to be closed off to traffic so their children can play safely , has been launched			1
the @entity8 initiative will allow children to play on their car - free street for a few hours every fortnight without parents having to worry about traffic			1
the scheme , introduced in @entity15 , applies to residential streets only and has been introduced as an opportunity for neighbours to get to know each other better and foster community spirit			0
safe game : parents can apply to have their street closed for traffic for a few hours so children living in the neighbourhood can play safely together on the road the scheme will go through a trial period of one year , @entity29 said , and applicants need supporting signatures from around two - thirds of their neighbours to be considered for approval			1
this means that a street can be closed for up to three hours every fortnight even if some of the residents object to the vehicle ban			2
@entity40 , the council ’s @entity41 , said there are some ‘ clear benefits ’ to the scheme for @entity15			0
‘ once established i am sure it will be something that is enjoyed by both young and older members of the community , much like the numerous street parties held across the borough were last year , ' he said			0
all together : it is hoped that by closing the streets from traffic for a few hours will foster community spirit and bring neighbours closer ( file photo ) he added : ‘ some local authorities run schemes where they only close streets if there are no objections			2
we are not planning to go that far but it is important that any application has as much support as possible from the residents who live on that street ’ although a @entity69 can be created on any day of the week , @entity29 has asked residents to avoid bin collection days			1
residents can apply for a play street day until july 12 with the first closure to be expected in early september .			0
