a music teacher has lost a staggering 11st over the past year , after being inspired by his mother			2
when his mother and father both lost weight as part of their recovery from life threatening illnesses , @entity3 , 38 , from @entity4 , was inspired to address his own size			1
at his worst eating upwards of six takeaways a week , @entity3 ’s weight had reached 28st by the time his father @entity18 , 67 , was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2012			1
@entity3 at his heaviest weight of 28st ( pictured ) would often eat up to six takeaways a week @entity3 , who used to eat three sandwiches for lunch alone , split several pairs of trousers at his largest @entity3 was ultimately inspired to lose weight after seeing his mother @entity26 not only survive cervical cancer but also lose 7st ( @entity3 and @entity26 before their weight loss , left , and today , right ) as he underwent radiotherapy to shrink the tumour , @entity3 ’s mother @entity26 , 62 , discovered she had cervical cancer and began chemotherapy			1
during his recovery @entity18 began to exercise with a trainer suggested to his through the @entity37 , and as well as aiding his recovery , saw him lose 2st			1
@entity26 , who has now been given the all - clear , also began to use the personal trainer allocated to @entity18 during his rehabilitation process , dropping an incredible 7st			1
seeing his parents , who had been overweight for years , turn their fight for life into an opportunity to improve their overall health and lose the excess weight , gave @entity3 the inspiration he needed to tackle his own eating issues			2
‘ i had known for years my weight was a problem			0
i ’d split a few pairs of trousers over the years but was very very lucky i had n’t had any major health problems from my size			0
‘ i had a really tough summer , with both my mum and dad becoming ill. it was one thing after another and i finally though enough is enough			0
@entity3 , having completed the swimming portion of a triathlon , lost the weight through a rigorous exercise regime and by totally overhauling his diet ‘ watching my mum ’s amazing recovery was so inspirational for me , and i was soon booking up her trainer to help me with my weight loss			1
@entity3 ’s personal trainer quickly put him onto a high protein , low carbohydrate diet which alongside his rigorous exercise regime helped him to lose such a substantial amount of weight			1
in total @entity3 has now lost 11st , dropping from 28st to 17st			2
‘ my health and fitness are through the roof			0
i just completed the @entity81 relay triathlon and i ’m doing a sprint triathlon in two weeks			1
in total @entity3 has now lost 11st , dropping from 28st to 17st ( pictured ) and hopes to lose more as he continues his training ‘ with all the extra training for that i ’m guessing i ’m going to lose another few kilos			2
the weight is just falling off me			0
a key factor in helping @entity3 with his new diet and weight loss programme was his use of protein supplements			1
‘ my personal trainer recommended i try out the @entity93 whey protein shake range which helped me to re-build my protein levels after a hard training session , ’ he explains			0
breakfast : big bowl of cereal , typically crunchy nut cornflakes snacks : several sausage rolls lunch : two or three @entity104 sandwich meal deals consisting of a sandwich , crisps or chocolate bar , and drink dinner : a takeaway like fish and chips breakfast : 3 boiled eggs , 2 rashers grilled bacon , 2 grilled tomatoes , grilled mushroom , banana , apple , pint of water and a green tea snacks : @entity125 protein shake lunch : grilled chicken breast , peas , carrots snack : nuts and fruit dinner : grilled chicken and veg			0
plus another shake after training ‘ the shakes also worked as the perfect alternative to snacks ; where i would usually grab a chocolate bar , or a bag of crisps , i instead made a phd @entity146 chocolate shake which , staved off my hunger and gave me the chocolate kick i was craving			0
’ @entity3 ’s mother and father – whose tumours growth has been successfully stopped by radiotherapy - are continuing their own new healthy lease on life			0
‘ they are incredibly proud of what i have achieved , ’ @entity157 .			0
