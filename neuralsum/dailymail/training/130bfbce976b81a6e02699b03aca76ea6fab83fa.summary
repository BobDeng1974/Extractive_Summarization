for confidential support call the @entity179 on 08457 90 90 90 or visit a local @entity179 branch – see @entity181 by @entity182 a full and searching inquiry was launched by @entity185 ’s media watchdog today into the royal radio prank , following which nurse @entity7 committed suicide			1
the @entity189 has powers to compel @entity160 ’s parent company , @entity159 , to name those who approved the infamous hoax going to air			0
the authority will look into whether the radio station complied with their broadcasting licence conditions – and insiders said today that if the findings were against the station it could lose its licence			2
presenter : @entity160 dj @entity55 is pictured ( right in left photo ) with her sister @entity204 ( left in left ) in @entity206 in april 2011 - and ( right ) at @entity207 in @entity185 in the same month the authority ’s chairman , mr @entity208 , said it would be examining ‘ whether the licensee has complied with its broadcasting obligations			2
’ miss @entity46 took her life just days after receiving a hoax phone call at @entity50 ’s king edward vii hospital from @entity144 djs @entity55 and @entity56			2
she and another nurse in the ward where @entity3 was being treated for morning sickness believed they were talking to the @entity57 and prince @entity58 , despite the unimpressive attempts by the @entity220 to imitate the royals			0
although @entity223 has repeatedly apologised for the ‘ tragic , regrettable death ’ of the nurse and has committed at least $ 500,000 ( £ 326,000 ) to a memorial fund for her family , the media watchdog has shown its determination to dig deeper into the scandal			2
it is expected to demand who was working at the time the hoax was perpetrated and who approved it			0
those who will be questioned , it is understood , will be producers and lawyers who were on duty , or on call , at the time			2
@entity159 has been in damage control ever since the death of nurse @entity46 , including permitting the two djs to appear on @entity54 tv and , amid their tears , express their sorrow for the tragic consequences of their hoax call			1
the watchdog will be referring heavily to the radio broadcasting code , particular a part which states that it is a breach to record a person in conversation , and also air it , without their knowledge			0
section 6.1 of the code states that ‘ a licensee must not broadcast the words of an identifiable person unless that person has been informed in advance or a reasonable person would be aware that the words may be broadcast			0
’ the section adds that there must not be a broadcast unless , ‘ in the case of words which have been recorded without the knowledge of the person , that person has subsequently , but prior to the broadcast , expressed consent to the broadcast of the word			0
’ the station ’s parent company has said it attempted to contact the hospital five times following the hoax call to discuss it , but had not been able to speak to anyone			2
the company has not explained why it still went to air with the recording even though it had not been able to reach anyone at the hospital following the prank			0
it is understood the hospital has written to @entity159 demanding to know how it has arrived at a figure of $ 500,000 to be given to the nurse ’s family – and has given it until tomorrow to reply			0
