by @entity0 , deputy political editor published : 17:19 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 05:37 est , 19 september 2013 @entity1 , pictured with his wife @entity2 , sought to paint himself as an ordinary working husband during his speech during his speech yesterday , @entity1 sought to paint himself as an ordinary working husband and family man			1
rather than moving to ‘ live behind the @entity9 battlements in @entity10 ’ to carry out his role as deputy prime minister , he was keen to highlight that he lives in the same house he has always done			1
the 46 - year - old @entity15 leader was rather less forthcoming , however , about the fact his luxurious home also happens to be in one of @entity20 ’s most sought - after areas			1
he further tried to underline his ‘ ordinary man ’ credentials by hinting that he would quit within the next few years			0
in a bid to convince voters that he is a normal person who is not obsessed by politics , he announced that he ‘ will not be in politics forever ’ so he can be ‘ a father , a husband , a son , an uncle to all those i love ’			0
despite having made much of his past pledges not to use his family to score points with voters , mr @entity1 repeatedly told anecdotes about his three sons , @entity35 , 11 , @entity36 , eight , and @entity37 , four			1
he also boasted that unlike @entity38 , who lives in @entity39 , he and his wife @entity2 had kept their family in @entity42 , @entity20			1
he said : ‘ @entity2 and i chose not to live behind the @entity9 battlements in @entity10			1
we try very hard to keep our family life normal and private – we keep our children away from the cameras			0
‘ we do n’t pretend we ’re a model family – we are who we are			0
we try to make sure @entity50 does n’t take over our lives			0
’ unlike the other parties , he also declared , @entity15 ‘ speak like humans ’			1
he also joked about demands by @entity15 peer @entity55 , an ally of @entity57 , that he resign as leader			2
the @entity1 's £ 1.5million townhouse in @entity20 - just a stone 's throw from the @entity63 waterfront ‘ i wo n’t be in politics forever			1
only three or four elections to go , ’ he said			0
aides said mr @entity1 would serve as party leader ‘ up to , including and beyond the next general election ’			2
however , many think he will walk away from frontline politics if he does not succeed in taking the @entity15 into government again			2
mr @entity1 conceded : ‘ my upbringing was privileged : @entity73 ; private school ; @entity75			2
i had a lot of opportunities			0
the @entity15 leader told his party that he would not be in politics forever ' but i also had two parents who were determined that my brothers , my sister and i knew how lucky we were			1
’ mr @entity1 , who has previously attacked journalists who ask questions about his children ’s schooling , then went on to tell how he and his wife use their summer trips to her home town in @entity92 to educate their sons about the political exploits of her father @entity95 , a conservative senator who died in 1996			2
‘ @entity2 tells them of the wonderful things he did			0
' we teach them – just as my parents taught me – that rights and values should never be taken for granted , and if you believe in them , you should stand up for them			0
’ the @entity104 also have use of @entity106 , in @entity107 - a 115 - room grace - in - favour mansion it may well be , as @entity1 was keen to point out , the same old family home he was living in before he become deputy prime minister			1
but it is one most of us can only ever dream of			0
the £ 1.5million home is in @entity42 , @entity20 , a rapidly - rising property hotspot and a stone ’s throw from the picturesque @entity63 waterfront			1
but whenever mr @entity1 and his wife and sons feel like a change of scene , they have plenty of options			2
in winter , they have the run of his mother ’s £ 7million , luxury 20 - room mountain chalet near the exclusive @entity131 resort of @entity132			2
meanwhile , his father ’s ten - bedroom chateau near @entity135 , in @entity136 , provides an idyllic summer escape			0
then there is the grace - and - favour 115 - room mansion , @entity106 , in @entity107 , where the @entity104 entertain guests			0
while mr @entity1 ’s £ 134,565 salary sounds more than comfortable to most mere mortals , it is dwarfed by his @entity92 - born wife ’s estimated £ 600,000 a year income as a commercial lawyer at the major @entity148 law firm @entity147			1
the daughter of a @entity151 senator , she is also a director of a @entity92 building company			0
mr @entity1 himself was raised in luxury in @entity155 , @entity156 , going to £ 19,000 - a - year @entity158 prep school and then @entity159			1
his maternal grandfather was a friend of the @entity162 royal family and his banker father , @entity163 , is the son of a @entity166 - born baroness .			0

@entity1 tried to show he is ordinary working husband during @entity168
told @entity15 he *refused* to live ' behind @entity9 battlements '
did not mention £ 1.5m townhouse in sought - after @entity20 *postcode*
