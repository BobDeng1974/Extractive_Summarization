by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:50 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 11:02 est , 17 october 2013 crime has fallen to its lowest level since records began more than 30 years ago , official figures revealed today			0
there were about 8.5 million crimes last year , down 7 per cent despite cuts to police budgets			1
but there was a nine per cent rise in reports of sexual offences , in part blamed on the inquiry into abusers like @entity17 encouraging victims to come forward			1
record low : the number of crimes reported to the annual survey in @entity23 and @entity24 fell seven per cent to 8.5million in the year to june based on the @entity26 there were just over 8.5million crime in the year to june 2013 , down from 9.1 million on the previous 12 months			1
it means the headline crime figure is the lowest since the survey began in 1981 , and is now less than half its peak level in 1995			0
of crimes actually recorded by the police after complaints from the public , there were 3.7 million offences in the year to june , a decrease of five per cent compared with the previous year			1
crime prevention minister @entity39 said : ‘ police reform is working and crime is falling			2
‘ recorded crime has dropped yet again , by more than 10 per cent under the coalition government , and the crime survey says that crime has more than halved since its peak in 1995			0
‘ this is really positive news			0
forces are rising to the challenge of making savings whilst cutting crime and delivering a better service to the public			0
' beat : police have seen falls in violent crime and robberies but the number of reports of sexual offences has risen he went on : ' @entity23 and @entity24 are safer than they have been for decades but we will continue to deliver measures which keep pace with the changing nature of crime and improve our ability to combat emerging issues			1
’ the rise in reports of sexual offences was put partly down to greater numbers coming forward to report historical sexual offences to the police			1
cuts : @entity76 minister @entity39 said the falls i crime had been achieved at a time when police budgets were squeezed the @entity81 said : ‘ there is evidence to suggest that these increases are partly a result of the @entity87 investigation , initiated in october 2012 and connected to the @entity17 inquiry			1
‘ whilst some of these increases will be a direct consequence of the crimes reported as part of @entity87 there is also evidence to suggest that there has been a wider “ @entity98 effect ” 1 whereby there is increased willingness on the part of the victims to come forward and report historical sexual offences that are not directly connected to @entity103			1
‘ additionally the publicity surrounding @entity87 may have encouraged more victims to come forward and report more recent abuse cases			2
’ there was also a 21 per cent rise in fraud offences recorded			2
the @entity81 said the figures should be viewed in the context of a move towards the centralised recording of fraud by police			0
there were also increases in theft from the person , which was up eight per cent , and shoplifting , up 1 per cent			0
@entity121 , head of @entity122 , at the think - tank @entity123 , said : ‘ whether you believe it ’s as the result of an ageing population , better policing and prevention , or the impact of the internet , there is little doubt that @entity135 is becoming a safer place to live , do business and raise a family			0
‘ but crime is still too high and there are pockets of the country which remain blighted by anti-social behaviour and gang activity			0
‘ while the latest figures show that the police have been able to cut crime substantially even with fewer resources , they must now redouble their efforts to tackle the hardcore of prolific offenders who commit offences that can often disproportionately hit the poor and the vulnerable			2

8.5million crimes reported in year to june , down 7 *%* on 2012
