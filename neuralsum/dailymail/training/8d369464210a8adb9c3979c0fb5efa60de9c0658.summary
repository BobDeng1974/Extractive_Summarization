slapping on sunscreen could reduce a man 's ability to have a baby , according to new research			0
a study found that chemicals commonly found in sunscreen , which filter out uv rays , can impair male fertility			1
experts warned when these chemicals are absorbed by the skin , they can interfere with the body 's hormones			1
men exposed to specific chemicals called @entity17 - 2 or @entity18 had a 30 per cent reduction in fertility			1
chemicals which filter out uv rays - commonly found in sunscreens , shampoos and moisturisers can impair male fertility			1
men exposed to two chemicals - @entity17 - 2 or @entity18 - had their fertility reduced by 30 per cent however it was unclear whether they damaged sperm quality or inhibited fertility in another way			1
the group of chemicals , called benzophenone - type ultraviolet filters , are commonly used in sun , shampoo , moisturisers and other cosmetics to protect the skin and hair from sun damage			1
interestingly , the chemicals affected male fertility , but not female , the researchers noted			2
while women were more exposed to @entity49 filters overall , this was n't associated with a delay to them becoming pregnant			2
previous research has linked high concentrations of phthalates - chemicals found in plastics - to reduced fertility in men			2
the same effect was seen in men exposed to high levels of the chemical @entity60 ( @entity60 ) , found in plastic bottles			0
as part of the study , researchers studied 501 couples who were trying to conceive a child , recruited between 2005 and 2009			0
the couples were part of the @entity69 ( @entity71 ) study , established to examine how lifestyle factors and exposure to environmental chemicals affects fertility			0
the women ranged from 18 to 44 years of age , and the men were over 18			0
none of the them had been diagnosed as infertile			0
the researchers followed the couples for one year until they became pregnant or kept trying , in order to record the time it took for the women to become pregnant			0
they also tested their urine samples and measured for concentrations of five selected uv filters previously shown to disrupt the body 's hormone and endocrine system			1
in their analysis of the data , the researchers controlled for age , body mass index , and smoking , among other factors			0
some , but not all , uv filters may be associated with diminished fertility in men , whether their partners were exposed or not , they found			1
researchers advise men to keep using sunscreen to protect against skin cancer			2
but if they are worried about fertility they could was it off when they go indoors and cut down on other products containing uv filters the largest effect was seen in men with the highest exposure to the chemicals			1
' the skin is the body 's largest organ , and how we care for our skin matters in more ways than one , ' said dr @entity122 , @entity123			2
' sunscreen is important for sun protection , and we definitely encourage people to continue using sunscreen to avoid skin cancer			2
' but men who are concerned about fertility may be interested in other ways to reduce their exposure to benzophenone uv filters - whether by cutting back on other products that contain the uv filters or by washing after returning indoors			1
' ' our next step is to figure out how these particular chemicals may be affecting couple fecundity or time to pregnancy - whether it 's by diminishing sperm quality or inhibiting reproduction some other way			0
' however , the researchers admitted they tested urine samples from the couples once , but this may have changed over the months they were trying to conceive a baby			0
the study findings were published online in the @entity149 .			0

*offending* group of chemicals called *benxophenone* - type ultraviolet filters
they are commonly found in sunscreen , shampoos and moisturisers
can interfere with the body 's hormone and endocrine system , experts said
two chemicals called @entity17 - 2 and @entity18 reduced male fertility by 30 *%*
women were more exposed to them but it did n't affect female fertility
experts advise not to stop using sunscreen *due* to *danger* of skin cancer
men worried about fertility should wash sunscreen off when go indoors
or they could cut down on other products containing uv filters
