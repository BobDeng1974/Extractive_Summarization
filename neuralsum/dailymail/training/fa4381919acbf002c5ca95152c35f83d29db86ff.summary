@entity0 has vowed to take his @entity2 chance and keep @entity3 out of @entity5 ’s plans			1
@entity0 , 23 , is on the cusp of winning his first senior international cap after a sparkling start to the campaign			1
he was called up ahead of @entity10 ’s @entity3 , 30 , who has 54 @entity2 caps			1
it shows that i ’m getting credited for the good performances i ’ve been putting on			2
i ’ve been given my chance now and i ’m going to make it count			0
' i ’m ready for any game if it ’s against @entity31 or @entity32			0
there are a lot of younger players pushing to get in the team and it ’s always good to have young legs to run around			1
' @entity0 joins his former @entity40 team - mate @entity39 in the @entity2 set - up with perhaps a greater claim to starting against @entity31 in the @entity44 qualifier on saturday			1
@entity40 are four places and eight points above @entity47			2
@entity48 playfully shoves @entity49 before the @entity51 striker takes on @entity52 ( right ) ' i think i ’ve settled in well and i ’m looking forward to playing , ’ said @entity0			2
' it ’s good to have the competition ( with @entity55 )			0
it keeps you on your toes			0
we get the best out of each other			0
' @entity0 believes @entity40 , currently second in the @entity62 , can maintain their place in the top four and qualify for the @entity65			1
' we ’re on a good run of form at the moment and we keep on winning , ’ he said			1
' the spirit is high			0
we ’re playing good football			0
i do n’t think we ’ve gone off after a game and thought : " we ’ve got lucky there "			0

@entity0 is on the cusp of winning his first @entity2 cap
he 's impressed this term and has been called up instead of @entity3
the 23 - year - old sees no reason why @entity40 ca *n't* maintain good form
@entity0 joins former @entity40 team - mate @entity39 in the squad
