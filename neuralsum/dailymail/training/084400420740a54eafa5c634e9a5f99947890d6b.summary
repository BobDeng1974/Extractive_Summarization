it has long been admired as the fastest animal			0
but it seems the cheetah ’s lead over other species is not as wide as we thought			0
research shows that the feline ’s top speed is just 58mph , rather than the 70mph which was accepted for decades			1
the myth is dispelled in sir @entity13 ’s new series of @entity14 , in which he examines the most up - to - date findings			1
‘ the cheetah ’s legendary top speed of 70mph is just a myth			1
but their true speed of 58mph is still extraordinary			1
’ he added that while the cheetah may not be as speedy as previously believed , it still holds its title as the world ’s fastest land animal			0
‘ its greatest feat is its acceleration , ’ he said , ‘ [ which is ] four times that of sprinter @entity40			0
’ presenter : sir @entity13 in tv show natural curiosities the presenter – whose broadcasting career began when he joined the @entity46 in 1952 – shows just how comfortable he is with animals , filming one segment of the documentary next to an affectionate cheetah , which happily purrs and licks his knee			1
he explains the new and more accurate speed measurements were taken using high - tech data collection collars			1
the more accurate speed measurements were taken using high - tech collars , which used solar batteries and gps to track the animals ’ movements			1
researchers collected data from 367 cheetah ‘ hunts ’ and the top speed reached during any of the chases was just 58 miles per hour			1
the research was developed by scientists at the @entity68 who honed the technique using greyhounds and lurchers			0
the dogs are ‘ similar in size and shape to a cheetah ’ so worked as a good substitution for the more unpredictable wild animals			0
both have backs that flex and extend so greatly that at times none of their feet touch the ground			0
when researchers were sure the collar was not affecting the movement of the dogs , they tested the technology on wild cheetahs and found that previous estimations had been out by a whopping 12 miles per hour			2
the myth that cheetahs could reach 70mph began in 1957 after photographer @entity92 conducted a basic experiment using an upturned bicycle and some fishing line to pull along a meat - scented bag			2
he used a stopwatch and a pistol to record how long it took a cheetah to run 73 - metre course			0
his results – showing cheetahs reaching speeds of 70 miles per hour - were soon accepted as scientific fact			2
the third series of @entity14 starts at 9pm on february 2 on watch .			2

myth *busted* by researchers who attached gps trackers to big cats
they gathered data from 367 hunts and 58mph was the top speed
results will be shown on sir @entity13 's new tv series
