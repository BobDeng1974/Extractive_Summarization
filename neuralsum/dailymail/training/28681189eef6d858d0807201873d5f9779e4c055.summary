a supermarket assistant who had three girlfriends at the same time was confronted by all of them when he flew home from holiday			2
@entity7 , 20 , had been stringing along @entity8 , 17 , @entity9 , 19 , and another girl , who does not wish to be named , for more than six months without any of them finding out about each other			1
but when he went away on holiday , @entity13 discovered he was cheating on her with both @entity9 and the other girl , who is 20 , so they came up with the idea of humiliating him at the airport when he got home			1
the @entity22 worker from @entity23 , @entity24 , walked through arrivals onto @entity27 's main concourse to be confronted by all three girls shouting ' @entity29 ' at him before he fled with his grandmother			1
she told @entity44 : ' i 'd known @entity7 for three years but started seeing him in march , and early on we had the conversation that we were n't seeing anyone else , that we were exclusive			2
' i was in love with him , and he said he was in love with me , but i had my suspicions from the start			0
' he was very protective of his phone , he would n't let me put pictures of me and him on social networks , he deleted comments i made about us - looking back , he was very shady			2
' @entity13 , who said mr @entity7 was ' very clever with words ' , was at his house the night before he flew on holiday when she picked up his phone and saw a message from a girl saying ' i will meet you later '			1
it instantly made her suspicious as she said he 'd asked her to go home early that night as he had to finish his packing			0
@entity13 , who works part - time as a hairdresser when she 's not studying , said : ' @entity7 caught me and we had a row - i asked who this girl was and he said she was just a friend			1
' mr @entity7 , pictured with @entity13 earlier this year , used excuses about seeing family and friends to juggle girls the next day , after mr @entity7 had flown off on holiday to see family in @entity79 , @entity13 found the girl , who lives in @entity23 but does not want to be named , on @entity81 and sent her a message			1
@entity13 said : ' i told her we were both seeing the same person and she was n't surprised - she had been with him since january , and had always had her suspicions ' the two girls then met and discovered there was a third girl , @entity9 , 19 , who lives in @entity23 , and made contact with her through @entity90			1
@entity9 , a bar supervisor , had been dating mr @entity7 since meeting him on @entity90 in april			1
she said : ' he was a real charmer and had a real way with words - he knew how to say the right thing at the right time			0
' but what i did n't realise was that when he was going off to see his friend ' @entity97 ' , he was actually seeing one of the other girls			0
he did it to them , too , saying he was going to see ' @entity102 ' when he was seeing me			0
the three women mr @entity7 was seeing have now become firm friends - and say they 're glad he 's gone messages of a betrayal : this was the @entity90 conversation between the third girl and @entity9 , in blue the girls met in the pub to compare notes , and discovered he had been using excuses he was seeing friends or family when he was actually seeing one of them			1
@entity9 said : ' i suggested as a joke that we should all go to the airport to meet him			0
the other two said " yes , good idea " straightaway , so we met on saturday morning and went to the airport together			0
' as mr @entity7 came out through customs , all three girls called his name			1
@entity13 said : ' he froze and looked at us			0
he said : " why are you here ? why would you do this ? " ' we were like " are you joking ? " ' i said to him : " i ca n't believe how you could be like this for seven months			0
" ' @entity9 said : ' he came out of customs and saw all of us and his face just dropped			2
we said we wanted to talk to him , and he said " ca n't i talk to you later ? " and we said no , we wanted to talk to him now			0
' i said to him " do n't you have anything to say to us ? " '			0
mr @entity7 headed towards the car park with his grandmother , who had come to collect him , but the girls continued to berate him , stopping only to explain what their grievance was to his grandmother			1
' she just shrugged and said " ok " when we told her why we were angry ' , @entity13 said			0
@entity13 put a picture of the girls at the airport on @entity81 , with the caption : ' just been at the airport to meet my cheating boyfriend ... ' and was celebrated as a hero by @entity81 users , who said : ' this is awesome - you go , girl			1
' now the girls , who say they 're happy to have ousted him from their lives , have forged firm friendships with each other			0
' they 're great - i 'm seeing both of them for nights out soon , ' said @entity13			2
' we ca n't think what we saw in @entity7 in the first place			0
' i 'm so glad we confronted him - it 's not the 16th century any more - girls do n't have to put up with this			1
' mr @entity7 did not reply to @entity44 's request for a comment today .			2
