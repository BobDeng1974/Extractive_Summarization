@entity0 , 47 , was dismissed by @entity1 in @entity2 for ‘ unprofessional and inappropriate conduct ’ two weeks ago			1
at the time of the announcement , the school ’s governors failed to release any more details			0
however , an investigation by this newspaper has discovered that mr @entity0 – who became the academy ’s first male head when he was appointed to the post 18 months ago – sent informal emails over a period of months to the sixth - form pupil , including messages written at night and during the holidays			1
school rules strictly forbid teachers sending messages to pupils from private email accounts			0
the @entity31 academy has described mr @entity0 ’s actions a ‘ serious breach of safeguarding procedures ’			1
despite this , the @entity35 appeared to play down the seriousness of his conduct			0
in a statement to @entity9 , the union implied mr @entity0 ’s actions only amounted to a breach of the school ’s information and communications technology rules			1
the governors – who began their investigation following a tip - off – are said to have been ‘ stunned ’ by the @entity35 statement			0
the specialist science college and languages school , which counts singer @entity50 and @entity52 gold medallist @entity51 among its alumni , passed judgment on mr @entity0 at an internal disciplinary hearing earlier this month , ruling he had broken rules in place to prevent personal communications between staff and pupils			2
it is understood this was in breach of guidance telling teachers never to use a private email account to send messages to pupils , partly for their own protection			0
the school has refused to reveal the precise content of the emails , but it is understood they were informal and read like text messages			0
it is believed there were also concerns about the way mr @entity0 , the former deputy headmaster of all - girl @entity78 in nearby @entity80 , had treated the student differently from other pupils			2
mr @entity0 , who is understood to be unmarried and who lives in @entity84 , @entity2 , declined to comment directly to @entity9			1
messages : an investigation by the @entity9 has revealed it was a series of ' informal ' emails to a sixth form pupil which led to his dismissal from the specialist science college ( pictured ) alumni : former pupils include @entity50 ( pictured ) and @entity52 gold medallist @entity51 but a statement sent to this newspaper , released by the @entity35 ’s @entity97 secretary @entity96 , said : ‘ the alleged misconduct related to communication with a student which breached the school ’s policy on the accepted use of @entity105 [ information and communications technology ]			2
‘ mr @entity0 accepted he had breached the school ’s policy and that as headmaster he had responsibility for ensuring he and other staff acted in accordance with the policy			2
defence : the @entity35 have said : ' mr @entity0 vehemently denies he behaved inappropriately towards any student and no such finding was made '			1
pictured : the school 's motto ‘ mr @entity0 vehemently denies he behaved inappropriately towards any student and no such finding was made			1
mr @entity0 appreciates that this placed governors in a difficult situation given that rumours could have a negative effect upon the reputation of the school			2
’ the statement added he was considering whether to appeal against ‘ the severity of the sanction imposed by the @entity130 ’			0
chairman of governors , @entity131 , said in a letter to parents this month : ‘ the governing body has terminated @entity0 ’s employment at @entity1 due to serious breaches in applying safeguarding procedures and instances of unprofessional and inappropriate conduct			1
‘ this was not an easy decision , especially because we recognise that since @entity0 ’s appointment there have been many positive changes within the school led by @entity0 and the senior leadership team			0
‘ however , the governing body and staff take their safeguarding responsibilities towards students very seriously and , importantly , any breaches of safeguarding procedures , and have therefore acted promptly to address these matters			0
’ @entity157 , the school ’s bursar , said the education of the 1,200 pupils would be unaffected by the sacking , despite it coming just weeks before @entity165 and a-level exams .			0

the reason was given as ‘ unprofessional and inappropriate conduct ’
@entity9 investigation discovers it was due to emails sent to pupil
but mr @entity0 denies he behaved inappropriately towards any student
