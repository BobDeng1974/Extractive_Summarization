as a lifelong fan , the practicalities of going half way round the world for a ‘ panda short break ’ were never questioned			2
true , we ’ve got two of the species our own now , far closer to home at @entity9 but nothing beats seeing them in - or at least in the same country as - their natural environment			1
so , i readily travelled to the @entity15 province in southwest @entity16 , the native home of the giant panda to visit two breeding centres			1
they are reclusive animals and difficult to spot			0
but these two dedicated breeding centres give you an opportunity to watch these incredible creatures close - up – in surroundings that are as much like their natural habitat as possible			0
the @entity44 – just outside the city of @entity29 – is home to 83 adults and cubs			1
if you get here shortly after 8am you avoid the crowds and have ample time to watch the pandas before they get lethargic later on in the day			1
they live in spacious enclosures with trees , mounds , wooden climbing frames with slides and – if there are cubs – a few plastic rocking horses			0
pandas are captivating animals , particularly the cubs who spend much of the time embroiled in seemingly vicious playfights			2
these can last up to half an hour – or until they are exhausted – and involve biting , wresting , yapping and rolling interlocked down slides and ditches			0
@entity73 pets a young panda cub at the @entity29 sanctuary during her visit @entity77 cubs spend much of their time embroiled in seemingly vicious playfights that can last half an hour at the panda nursery , you can look through glass to see tiny babies – one or two months old - sleeping in cots or on blankets on the floor			1
normally they are born in either late june , july or september and weigh just 100g – an average adult is 900 times the size			0
they do n’t grow fur until one week and open their eyes at about six weeks			0
@entity92 allows volunteers to be panda keepers for the day at a cost of about £ 35 but giant panda cubs are n’t easy to produce			1
the females are only fertile for between one and three days a year in spring and even then the couple often do n’t appear to know how to mate or get bored half way through			0
for this reason , the breeding centres commonly resort to panda @entity102			2
this is similar to the human version and pandas are sedated while a sample of sperm is taken from the male and implanted into the female			2
@entity9 has twice used @entity102 on @entity110 and @entity111 - without success			0
they have been on loan from the @entity16 government since 2011 and will remain for another seven years in a bid to help them produce a cub			1
hopes were initially raised this summer when @entity110 appeared to be pregnant but it later emerged she had reabsorbed the cub , a common occurrence			0
just a two hours ’ drive south west from @entity29 by bus or taxi is the @entity92 – which is where the @entity9 pandas are from			1
here you volunteer to be a panda keeper for a day for roughly £ 35			1
i was handed overalls , gloves and ‘ all access ’ passes allowing us into the enclosures			0
i was instructed to chop bamboo and weigh out portions of panda cake – a nutritious mixture of soy , corn , bamboo and egg – before feeding it to them			2
stroking is strictly forbidden in case the pandas bite but when the keepers are n’t watching , it ’s very difficult to resist			0
stroking the pandas is forbidden but with cuties like this it 's hard to resist when the keepers are n't watching the volunteer program is disorganised and even if you do it for a week , you will remain at the same enclosure undertaking the same tasks			1
a day is plenty – however much you love pandas			2
@entity92 only started admitting tourists in 2008 and is far less developed than the breeding centre at @entity29 , which has been open since 1993			1
the advantage is that it is n’t nearly as crowded although , by comparison , there is very limited information about the individual pandas , the species or how the breeding program works			2
at the end of the day it 's possible to do a stunning , three - mile walk along @entity172 back to the car park with views of waterfalls and sheer cliff faces			2
there are also regular shuttle buses though if your legs are n't up to it			0
both @entity92 and @entity29 offer tourists the chance to hug a teenage panda for one minute – strictly timed – for a charge of about £ 200			1
@entity92 only started admitting tourists in 2008 and is far less developed than the breeding centre not just for the black and white variety , red pandas also have a home at the breeding centres compared to the cost of volunteering for the day this seems extortionate and you ca n't help but worry about the effects it has on the panda			1
pandas aside , @entity29 is striving to be @entity16 ’s fifth most important city after @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202			1
be a panda keeper for the day at @entity92 for about £ 35			1
a standard double or ‘ deluxe ’ room at the @entity205 , @entity29 , costs about £ 152 ( 1,488 @entity207 )			1
a double or twin room at the @entity209 costs about £ 163 ( 1,608 rmb )			0
@entity210 flies five times a week direct from @entity212 to @entity29 on the @entity213			2
return fares start from £ 570 return , including taxes and charges			0
for reservations visit ba.com or call 0844 493 0758			0
the main @entity221 square , the @entity222 , the numerous temples and street markets can easily take up a day			0
it is also famed for its tea houses - but beware the men brandishing metal rods offering to dewax your ears for a small fee			0
i also spent a night at @entity233 , a holy mountain two hours south - west of @entity29 which is a great spot for hiking			2
the @entity238 temples and summit of the mountain get very crowded , particularly during summer and public holidays			0
but hiking is n’t popular in @entity16 so there are very few tourists on the scenic – and at times , strenuous , trails - in between			1
i drove back by the @entity248 , the largest in the world at 71m			0
this is one of @entity16 ’s most famous attractions and is probably best visited for a few hours towards the end of the day when the crowds have thinned			1
@entity210 started flying direct from @entity212 to @entity29 last year and there are now five flights a week making a panda short break entirely feasible			1
and at least some of that 11 hour flight home can be passed flicking back through pictures or footage of those adorable creatures .			0

@entity262 visited @entity16 's @entity15 province to learn about the species
the @entity44 is home to 83 pandas
at @entity92 volunteers pay £ 35 to be a keeper for a day
both @entity92 and @entity29 offer tourists chance to ' hug a panda ' for £ 200
