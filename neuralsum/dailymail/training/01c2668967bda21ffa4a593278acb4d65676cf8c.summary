by @entity0 published : 05:10 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 14:49 est , 4 october 2012 these incredible pictures show how a cheeky octopus foiled the efforts of marine researchers to investigate the feeding habits of sea life			1
the researchers dropped a bait cage into the waters of @entity10 , @entity11 , as part of a survey of creatures living off the coast of @entity16			1
but they did n't count on this thieving invertebrate sneaking along and not only stealing the food , but taking away the entire cage itself			1
it shows schools of fish swimming around the cage , attracted by the bait it is ejecting into the surrounding waters			1
all seems fairly mundane , until the octopus floats along and wraps its tentacles around the cylinder			1
the tenacious animal envelops the contraption entirely , tugging on the chain connecting the cylinder to the researchers ' boat above and bracing itself against the sea floor for leverage			2
it wrestles with the box for some time , no doubt scoffing any food it is ejecting while thwarting the hapless fish who hope to pick up any scraps left behind			2
then , as suddenly as it appeared , the octopus swims off , with the bait box securely in its grip - leaving a lonely chain anchored to the sea floor and the marine biologists facing a bill for new equipment			2
@entity10 , off @entity11 , @entity16 , where the video was recorded by marine conservationists octopuses are believed to be highly intelligent , more so than any other kind of invertebrates ; but their learning capability is still much debated among biologists			1
the creatures have been known to break out of aquariums and into others in search of food , and they have even boarded fishing boats and opened holds to eat crabs stored inside			1
they are the only invertebrate which has been shown to use tools , with some species , as pictured above right , retrieving discarded coconut shells and reassembling them to use as shelter			1
maze and problem - solving experiments have shown evidence that the animals have a memory system that can store both short and long - term memory , but it is not known precisely what contribution learning has on adult octopus behaviour			2
in laboratory experiments they can be readily trained to distinguish between different shapes and patterns			2
in several widely contested studies , they have even been shown to practise observational learning			0
in some countries , octopuses are on the list of experimental animals on which surgery may not be performed without anaesthesia			1
@entity51 animal testing laws regard them as ' honorary vertebrates ' , extending them protections not afforded to other invertebrates			1
the incredible scene was witnessed by marine biologists funded by the @entity42 foundation who deployed their @entity139 ( @entity139 ) system in @entity10 to investigate the decline of sea life in the area			0
@entity143 , a research assistant at the @entity145 ’s @entity144 , explained on the @entity42 blog how the aim of the study is to develop an understanding of the conservation status of fish in the area , which has been heavily exploited by man for nearly two centuries			0
' by attracting fish into the field of view of a remotely - controlled camera , the technique records diversity , abundance and behaviour of species , ' she said			0
' as a non-extractive technique , it offers a low environmental impact way of understanding changes in fish numbers and diversity over time			0
' after two centuries of exploitation by fishermen , many species in @entity16 waters are now in serious decline , ms @entity143 said			0
however monitoring of the conservation situation of much of the sea life has been inadequate as a result of the cost and practicality of getting down to the sea floor			0
bruv surveys were first developed in @entity184			0
they attract fish into the field of view of a remotely controlled camera , allowing researchers to record the diversity , abundance and behaviour of species			0
ms @entity143 added : ' with a long history of fishing activity , @entity10 presents an important and interesting site for the development of a bruv monitoring system that will maximise the amount of data collected on any given day , and lower the costs of doing so to become a realistic option for fishery and mpa managers ’ budgets			0

octopuses so intelligent @entity51 law *treats* them as ' honorary vertebrates '
they are the only invertebrate creatures to have been observed to use tools
