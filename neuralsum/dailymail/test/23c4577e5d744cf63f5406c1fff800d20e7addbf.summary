' i think they literally need another set of hands because the demand is so high			0
' during the procedure , he was forced to used basic equipment , such as a saw rather than an electric drill , and sterile water and iodine from a bottle , rather than a proper scrub sink , he told @entity1			0
following the operation , she is ' doing well ' , @entity0 said , ' but her story is unfortunately very typical '			2
after the surgery , an eight - year - old girl arrived at the hospital needing a similar operation			1

4,352 people are believed to have died , *including* at least four @entity102 , and more than 6,000 suffered injuries
