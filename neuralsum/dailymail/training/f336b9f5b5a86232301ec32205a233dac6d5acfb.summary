@entity0 may only seem good for a bleary - eyed lunch with the in - laws			1
but it seems a deluge of shoppers are hauling themselves out of bed - and returning those @entity7 rejects			1
today will see more presents exchanged than any other , claims a report by business analysts , and the number could hit a record high thanks to the rise of online shopping			1
with a string of shopping centres up and down @entity17 opening as late as 9pm , the day has been dubbed @entity18 thursday by the analysts			2
ready to hit the shops ... again ? a report claims today will see a peak of gift returns - despite a public holiday some 29million unwanted presents are being returned from online shops alone this year with an expected value of £ 600million , estimates the report by @entity29			1
the firm , which advises businesses on their supply chains , said past figures suggest 15 per cent of all online presents are returned - and around 200million were set to be delivered over @entity7			1
despite the public holiday - and for people who work long hours , because of it - the report claimed many @entity7 presents will be returned today			1
many returns of goods originally ordered online will happen in person , it added , thanks to quicker refunds and the added lure of the sales			0
the firm 's founder @entity48 , a visiting professor at @entity50 in @entity51 , said some departments faced having more than half of all their sales returned			0
that could pose a challenge for small independent shops which rely on @entity7 income , and prompt long till queues at big - name chains which have an online ordering arm			1
of shops opening on @entity0 , he said : ' i think the retailers want to maximise the available time to persuade customers to spend their money , especially those without much free time			1
' some retailers such as @entity70 are still not opening , but those in a less strong position will be concerned not to lose the opportunity			0
scramble : shoppers on @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity78			0
the trend is among several promoting impulse buys which analysts say can lead to a higher number of gifts being returned in the cold light of day ' the most - returned items will be high fashion - trendy things given as gifts , and people may have bought one or two because they were n't sure what would fit , so one has to be returned			1
' his colleague @entity92 claimed the massive number of refunds and returns creates ' more pressure than ever for retailers to be slicker in managing their refund process '			0
he added : ' this will be a critical factor for future success , and become part of a new and increasingly complex battleground			0
' the firm claimed 600,000 orders from @entity107 will have required redelivering , many of them before christmas day			0
it estimated the average gift as costing £ 20			0
major shopping centres will be opening long hours today , despite @entity0 historically being quiet			1
@entity78 's two sprawling @entity115 malls will be open from 10am to 9pm , while shops at the @entity118 in @entity116 - @entity17 's largest - are open until 6pm			2
the huge @entity120 mall in @entity121 , @entity122 , will be open until 7pm while the @entity124 centre will be open until 6pm			0
shops in @entity78 's @entity126 - still recovering from the capital 's excesses last night - will be open until 7pm			2
not everyone has succumbed to the pressures of consumerism			0
@entity133 's @entity132 , the second - largest shopping centre in the country , will be almost completely closed today			2
and with a @entity138 poll showing we spent £ 604 per household on gifts , perhaps some people just ca n't bear the thought of hitting the shops again			2
especially with that hangover .			0

experts claim presents worth £ 600m are being returned after @entity7
the peak is said to be the first thursday after the big day - which is today
despite it being @entity0 , many shops are open long hours
online shops set to be particularly hit and ' could be *underprepared* '
