a @entity1 woman has admitted she is ' positively surprised ' she can obtain child benefits from @entity3 for her son , even though he lives in @entity5			1
@entity6 is one of 20,000 immigrants from the @entity8 currently claiming benefits from the @entity10 for children who live in a different country			1
the mother - of - five is raking in £ 220 a month in welfare payments from the @entity10 thanks to her husband , @entity15 working in a @entity17 factory for a decade			1
their other children are all grown up ' i was positively surprised that @entity3 supported us and helped my family well , ' she told @entity33 documentary benefits @entity3 : life on the @entity36			1
' no one comes from @entity3 , from the welfare system , to check on us			0
no one comes to check that i am here with ( my son ) @entity25			2
' @entity6 had joined @entity15 and their other grown up children in @entity3 but she returned to @entity1 with ten - year - old @entity25 because he was struggling at school			1
although he is now apart from his father - who he only gets to see a few times a year - @entity6 says @entity25 is now much better off			1
the child benefit and child tax credit they receive via @entity15 in the @entity10 goes much further in their home country thanks to the lower cost of living			1
' this is our kingdom			0
in @entity1 , food is cheaper than in @entity57			2
we rent a flat for £ 350 a month			2
when we lived in @entity17 , we spent £ 800 a month , ' she said			1
' they are very trustful ' : evita is delighted she can still get benefits for her son even though he no longer lives in @entity3 apart : @entity15 , left , works at a factory in @entity17 so only sees his son a few times a year she added that she does n't see anything wrong with her child being supported by @entity10 taxpayers			1
she said : ' in my opinion , it is absolutely normal to receive benefits from abroad , from @entity10			2
it is where my husband works and i am entitled to claim benefits because of the system			2
' @entity6 said she resents accusations - which come from her fellow @entity1 people - that she is lazy or a scrounger for taking hand outs from @entity3			1
she said : ' @entity1 press say about thieves and scroungers			2
i 'm sad when i read these words about me			0
a lot of @entity1 comments are that i am lazy , i am counting on benefits only			0
' this is not true			0
i am hard working mum			0
i try to be the best mum for my son			0
it 's difficult to read stories about myself and their opinion			0
' hard - working mother : @entity99 runs her own restaurant so she only spends the money from @entity3 on ' food , books , toys and entertainment ' for her son as well as looking after her son , @entity6 has opened her own restaurant near their one bedroom flat in @entity5			1
she takes home a wage from the business so the £ 220 a month benefits she gets from the @entity10 are spent solely on her son			1
in contrast , @entity1 children only get £ 20 a month from their government			2
@entity6 said : ' @entity25 gets only @entity10 benefits			1
i was surprised but this money is extra money for my son			1
' normally , my husband transfers money through @entity120 which is very easy			0
i have money , after the transfer , from @entity3			0
i spend this money on @entity25 only			2
i use it to buy food , books , toys , entertainment ... we go to the cinema once a month			2
' she said she had no qualms about taking handouts from @entity3 to spend on her son			0
lower cost of living : @entity6 said money goes much further in @entity1 so they are better off at home off to work : the mother says she is not lazy as she works full - time			1
' i earn my own money , my business is doing well , ' she said ' i know a lot of people spend benefits on useless things , for example smokes and drinks			0
but look at me - i am a hard - working mum and businesswoman			0
i earn my own money , my business is doing well , ' she said			0
also in tonight 's documentary , that will be shown on @entity33 at 9pm , @entity155 father - of - three , @entity154 , reveals how he came to the @entity10 at the start of 2014 determined to claim thousands of pounds in @entity10 benefits			1
nearly one year on , he estimates that he gets £ 1,200 worth of benefits a month , and he is spending all of it renovating his family home back in rural @entity155			0
the programme takes a trip with @entity154 back to @entity155 to check the work in progress on his house			0
as the cost of living is cheaper there , the money goes a long way and @entity154 has bought a new boiler , a water pump and a new bath and toilet			0
plenty of work has been completed on the structure of the building – all paid for by @entity10 benefits			0
@entity154 is able to claim the benefits because he has self - employed status as a scrap metal collector in the @entity10 , even if he spends much of his time back home in @entity155			1
now @entity154 is signing up his one - year - old son @entity188 for child benefit , which he thinks will get him another £ 500 each month			1
