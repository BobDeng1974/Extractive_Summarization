a @entity1 oil boom is set to push @entity1 past @entity2 to become the world ’s top producer			1
driven by high prices and new drilling methods , the @entity1 production of crude oil is on track for the biggest single - year gain for more than 60 years			1
analysts claimed yesterday that , if the growth in domestic drilling continues , @entity1 will soon overtake @entity14 and @entity2 – and possibly become ‘ the new @entity15 ’ in another decade			1
the boom has surprised even the experts			0
production is expected to rise by 7 per cent to hit an average of 10.9million barrels a day this year			1
@entity35 officials say it will average 11.4million next year , just below the current @entity2 output of 11.6million			2
this will be the fourth straight year of crude increases and the biggest single - year gain since 1951			0
and @entity41 forecasts it could reach 13million to 15million barrels per day by 2020			2
but it has not led to cheaper petrol			0
prices are expected to stay relatively high for the next few years because of growing demand in developing nations and political instability in the @entity15 and @entity48			0
the last year the @entity1 was the world 's largest producer was 2002 , after the @entity2 drastically cut production because of low oil prices in the aftermath of 9/11			1
cost : the oil boom is , however , not expected to ease the cost of gasoline for hard - pressed @entity1 motorists boom : @entity1 oil production has increased for four years in a row and is expected to rise to 11.4 million barrels a day in 2013			1
on current trends it could soon overtake @entity2 's output since then , the @entity2 and the @entity14 have been the world leaders			2
@entity1 currently use around 18.7 million barrels per day - but thanks to the growth in domestic production and the improving fuel efficiency of the nation 's cars and trucks , imports could fall by half by the end of the decade			1
the increase in production has not translated to cheaper gasoline at the pump , and prices are expected to stay relatively high for the next few years because of growing demand for oil in developing nations and political instability in the @entity15 and @entity48			2
still , producing more oil domestically , and importing less , gives the economy a significant boost			0
increased drilling is driving economic growth in states such as @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 , all of which have unemployment rates far below the national average			0
businesses that serve the oil industry , such as steel companies that supply drilling pipe and railroads that transport oil , are not the only ones benefiting from the boom in production			2
homebuilders , auto dealers and retailers in energy - producing states are also getting a lift			0
the oil and gas drilling boom , which already supports 1.7 million jobs , is expected to lead to the creation of 1.3 million jobs across the @entity1 economy by the end of the decade			1
' it 's the most important change to the economy since the advent of personal computers pushed up productivity in the 1990s , ' says economist @entity125 , a visiting fellow at the @entity126			0
the major factor driving domestic production higher is a new found ability to squeeze oil out of rock once thought too difficult and expensive to tap			0
engineers have learned how to drill horizontally into long , thin seams of shale and other rock that holds oil , instead of searching for rare underground pools of hydrocarbons that have accumulated over millions of years			0
competition : @entity2 and @entity14 have led world oil production in recent years ( file picture ) to free the oil and gas from the rock , drillers crack it open by pumping water , sand and chemicals into the ground at high pressure , in a process known as hydraulic fracturing , or ' fracking			1
' the @entity1 oil boom has also been influenced by a long period of high oil prices and the recovery of production in the @entity159 following the 2010 @entity162 well disaster and oil spill			1
the most prolific of the new shale formations are in @entity92 and @entity96			0
activity is also rising in @entity93 , @entity166 , @entity167 and other states			0
production from shale formations is expected to grow from 1.6 million barrels per day this year to 4.2 million barrels per day by 2020			1
that means these new formations will yield more oil by 2020 than major oil suppliers such as @entity177 and @entity178 produce today			0
from 1986 to 2008 , crude production in the @entity1 fell every year but one - dropping by 44 percent over that period			1
the @entity1 imported nearly 60 percent of the oil it burned in 2006			0
by the end of this year , @entity1 crude output will be at its highest level since 1998 and oil imports will be lower than at any time since 1992 , at 41 percent of consumption			2
whether the @entity1 supplants @entity2 as the world 's biggest producer will depend on the price of oil and @entity2 production in the years ahead .			1

@entity1 production to rise 7 per cent this year to nearly 11 million barrels a day
could reach 11.4 million barrels a day in 2013 - *rivalling* @entity2 oil output
boom caused by high oil prices and new drilling *techniques*
