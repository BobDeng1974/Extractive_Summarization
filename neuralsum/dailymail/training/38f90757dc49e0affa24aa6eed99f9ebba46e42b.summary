the @entity1 oil spill left an oily ' bathub ring ' on the sea floor that 's about the size of @entity5 , new research shows			1
the study by @entity8 , the chief scientist on the federal damage assessment research ships , estimates that about 10 million gallons of oil coagulated on the floor of the @entity12 around the damaged @entity14 oil rig			1
@entity8 , a geochemistry professor at the @entity15 , said the spill from the @entity17 well left other splotches containing even more oil			2
new research shows that the @entity1 oil spill left an oily ' bathub ring ' on the seafloor that 's about the size of @entity5			1
the rig blew on april 20 , 2010 , and spewed 172 million gallons of oil into the @entity12 through the summer			1
scientists are still trying to figure where all the oil went and what effects it had			2
@entity1 was suspended from performing any new government work in @entity37 in november 2012 , after it agreed to plead guilty and pay a $ 4.5billion fine ( Â£ 2.8billion ) for criminal charges over the @entity22 disaster			0
he said it is obvious where the oil is from , even though there were no chemical signature tests because over time the oil has degraded			2
' there 's this sort of ring where you see around the @entity17 well where the concentrations are elevated , ' @entity8 said			0
the study , published in monday 's @entity53 , calls it a ' bathtub ring			0
' oil levels inside the ring were as much as 10,000 times higher than outside the 1,200 - square - mile ring , @entity8 said			0
a chemical component of the oil was found on the sea floor , anywhere from two - thirds of a mile to a mile below the surface			1
the rig blew on april 20 , 2010 , and spewed 172 million gallons of oil into the @entity12 through the summer			1
scientists are still trying to figure where all the oil went and what effects it had			0
@entity1 questions the conclusions of the study			0
in an email , spokesman @entity74 said , ' the authors failed to identify the source of the oil , leading them to grossly overstate the amount of residual @entity17 oil on the sea floor and the geographic area in which it is found			1
' the rig blew on april 20 , 2010 , and spewed 172 million gallons of oil into the @entity12 through the summer			1
it 's impossible at this point to do such chemical analysis , said @entity8 and study co-author @entity89 , a marine chemist at @entity90 , but all other evidence , including the depth of the oil , the way it laid out , the distance from the well , directly point to the @entity1 rig			2
outside marine scientists , @entity98 at @entity99 and @entity100 at @entity101 , both praised the study and its conclusions			0
the study does validate earlier research that long - lived deep water coral was coated and likely damaged by the spill , @entity89 said			0
but @entity89 and @entity8 said there are still questions about other ecological issues that deep .			0
