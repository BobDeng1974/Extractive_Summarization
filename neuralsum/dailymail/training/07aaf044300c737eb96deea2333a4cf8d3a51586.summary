ten of the drawings were also used in the set design for @entity36 , a @entity38 tv series directed by @entity39 and starring @entity40 some of @entity5 's works of art look hyper - realistic , while others are more artistically vivid , but all of them revolve around the same theme sometimes the sea takes a backseat in focus to other parts of the picture , like the photo - realistic clouds , and the wind blowing spray into the air @entity5 was formally trained at @entity28 , and now exhibits extensively in galleries and venues throughout the @entity13 and overseas each of @entity5 's pictures are an attempt to capture a unique part of the landscape , where sometimes the icebergs and land masses are the focus , and other times they take a back seat to the ocean some of @entity5 's pictures look so realistic you would be forgiven for thinking that they are simply photographs rather than laborious works of art the artworks all seem to capture a particular theme ; cold , made possible by @entity5 's extensive use of rich , deep , blue coloured paints originally from @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity5 , led an @entity15 expedition to the north west coast of @entity17 purposely with the aim of creating art inspired by the dramatic geography some of @entity5 's works of art have been inspired by standing on the shores of the ocean , while others were inspired by the arctic voyage @entity5 's mother , @entity21 , originally came up with the idea but sadly did n't live to see it through the finger paintings also seem to capture warmer seas , with this particular image looking more like tropical ocean than arctic ocean some of @entity5 's works have gone on sale for around $ 9,000 in private sales and auctions , and many are advertised on an artwork selling site in her paintings , @entity5 has not only captured the freezing cold areas , but also the time of day , with many pictures depicting different stages of her voyage to the icy seas this picture , depicting flowing seas disrupting calmer ones , was perhaps inspired by the view from a boat voyage , of the sea rather than a larger vista @entity5 in her studio			1
