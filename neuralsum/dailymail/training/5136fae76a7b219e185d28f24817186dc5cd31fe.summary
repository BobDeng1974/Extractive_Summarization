by @entity0 published : 20:51 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 21:06 est , 13 february 2013 the trial aims to find out if people will do their washing on ' green ' days when it is windy windy days have always been the time to do your washing , washerwomen of old hanging out clothes in the breeze so they dried quicker			1
and that tradition is set to continue long into the future - because putting the washing machine on could be cheaper when it is windy			2
energy firms are trying out a system which alerts customers when electricity prices are cheaper because wind conditions mean green power is cheap and plentiful			2
‘ day ahead electricity alerts ’ send text messages to customers or put an alert of their smart meter so they know to put their washing on			0
the year - long trial - conducted by @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 - aims to find out whether people are prepared to do their washing , tumble drying , and other electricity intensive tasks on windy days			1
the researchers have recruited 1,000 people for the trial , which could pave the way for firms to introduce new tariffs that encourage customers to make use of electricity at times when energy is at its cheapest or demand is at lowest			1
the @entity45 estimate that customers can save £ 250 on their energy bill by using appliances differently			1
@entity49 , professor of electrical and @entity51 at @entity28 , said it could save the whole country money and carbon by using electricity more efficiently			0
‘ it is crucial that we understand the role that residential consumers can play in the development of smarter electricity systems that will facilitate cost - effective evolution to a low carbon future , ’ he said			0
but not everyone is convinced the system will save much money			0
@entity66 , direct of think tank @entity68 , said building wind turbines has already added money to people ’s bills - and putting washing in on a windy day will not make up for that cost			0
the @entity45 estimates that people could save £ 250 by being more efficient he said : ‘ this sort of research should have started years ago , before the wind policies got under way , and , though interesting , the announcement is a clear case of too little too late			1
‘ @entity82 is already constraining @entity84 wind farms off the system at significant cost to the consumer , and the market data shows that @entity82 is bracing itself to constrain large offshore wind farms in @entity91 waters , such as the @entity92 , @entity93 , and @entity94 , to protect the system in the near future			0

energy firms are to let customers know when it is cheapest to do their washing
the year - long trial aims to find out if people will *respond* to being told which days are ' greener '
