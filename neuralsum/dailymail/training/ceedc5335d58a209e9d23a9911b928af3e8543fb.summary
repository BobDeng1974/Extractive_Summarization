@entity1 ’s proposed £ 25m - a - year shirt sponsorship with @entity2 , reportedly close to agreement before @entity4 , is understood to have stalled			1
@entity2 , who have a major individual deal with @entity1 striker @entity7 , are still at the table but are believed to be cautious about paying that sky - high price			1
it would propel @entity1 above @entity10 and @entity11 in the @entity13 shirt sponsorship table and into second place behind @entity15			1
@entity1 's current shirt deal with @entity17 began in 2005 but is up for renewal next season @entity2 have spread their wings and have linked up with @entity15 other companies remain in @entity1 talks but demanding owner @entity23 wants his club to be the no 1 commercially , even though @entity26 are in a different league			1
their shirt sponsorship with @entity29 is worth £ 53m annually			1
@entity1 say chief executive @entity31 ’s surprise departure last october was unconnected to no shirt sponsor having been secured to replace @entity17 next season			1
but @entity31 ’s exit was followed by a commercial revamp , with former @entity10 ceo @entity35 brought in to find that elusive backer			2
the @entity37 are considering producing their own tv highlights of next summer ’s domestic @entity39 to broadcast on @entity40 and other social - media outlets			1
the radical plan is seen as a way of promoting the game to a younger audience when falling participation and dwindling t20 attendances are being blamed on @entity49 ’ monopoly of the live action until 2019			2
however , the @entity37 ’s £ 67million - a - year deal with @entity49 — which bankrolls the game — allows for a separate @entity39 highlights agreement with terrestrial tv			1
the inaugural @entity39 was won by @entity55 last year @entity56 made his return to the game in last year 's competition after quitting the game in 2010 none of the free - to - air stations has shown much interest in the deal because of the big production costs and cricket ’s dependence on weather			1
so , influential voices in the @entity37 are looking at the governing body using their @entity49 - funded cash reserves to set up their own tv station			1
this would film the t20 competition in - house for wide distribution , such is the belief that cricket needs to find new followers			0
this urgency is demonstrated by the desire to have a developed @entity81 — there is already an @entity84 cricket video news service on the internet — to cover @entity39 this summer			0
the @entity86 , accused of treating its employees like ‘ the enemy ’ after it emerged 37 staff email accounts had been monitored as part of leak investigations , have long conducted internal inquiries to find moles — even for relatively innocuous stories			0
after @entity96 reported comments by former @entity84 manager @entity98 from a @entity86 forum attended by 400 people , the @entity86 investigations unit examined mobile phone records of those suspected of talking to @entity103			0
@entity104 replace @entity105 as the £ 750m @entity15 kit supplier next season			2
and the first signs of the swoosh shift in emphasis to the noisy neighbours comes with city manager @entity112 holding a question - and - answer session in the @entity105 store in @entity115 next week , during a winter training break			0
former @entity15 manager sir @entity117 is said to have become a lot less co-operative about @entity105 promotions after the @entity121 company ceased their individual deal with him			2
@entity124 president @entity123 , who said he would wait until the @entity126 celebrations were over before confirming he will stand for a fifth term , is now planning a low - key election campaign with a short mission statement next month			0
the challenge from @entity131 is not causing much anxiety			0
@entity124 insiders reckon only 10 territories in @entity135 will oppose @entity123 — one being the @entity136			0
78 - year - old @entity123 is set to stand for a fifth term as @entity124 president since taking over in 1998 there was sensitivity around @entity10 over the @entity4 period about the sale of warrior - supplied replica kit , because parent company @entity145 will be on rebranded @entity10 shirts next season			2
the @entity121 sports manufacturers have a heavy presence in @entity149 , where @entity10 want to make inroads			0
the need to stay in the @entity13 whatever the cost is demonstrated by the five clubs interested in bringing striker @entity154 back from @entity155 — @entity156 , who won the chase , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 are all in the bottom six .			0

@entity1 's current deal with @entity17 expires at the end of the season
@entity2 are still at the table but are believed to be cautious about paying that sky - high price
it would propel @entity1 above @entity10 and @entity11 in the @entity13 shirt sponsorship table and into second place behind @entity15

meanwhile the @entity37 plan to broadcast the @entity179 on social media
