by @entity0 for @entity1 a police community support officer who was accused of spanking a male colleague 's backside while he moved a filing cabinet has been cleared of sexual assault			1
a trial heard @entity8 , 50 , had developed an ' unhealthy interest ' with the fellow officer at a @entity12 police station , spying on him in a locker room and flashing her bra at him			1
but today the jury at @entity16 took less than an hour to clear @entity8 of sexual assault			1
cleared : @entity17 @entity8 , 50 , has been cleared of sexual assault after a colleague accused her of spanking his backside six times			1
tonight jurors were still undecided on a lesser charge of common assault they were still considering a lesser charge of common assault , on which she could still be found guilty tomorrow if the jury decide she struck the young man on the backside without sexual intent			1
during her two - day trial , it was also claimed @entity8 offered to massage the @entity17 and behaved provocatively towards him in a lift during months of harassment			1
her accuser compared the alleged peeping incident as ' like something out of @entity40 movie ' and said he felt more comfortable dealing with criminals			2
he said the spanking incident , alleged to have occurred while he carried a filing cabinet through the building with a colleague , was ' the final straw ' after months of harassment			2
defendant : @entity8 was accused of flashing her bra at an officer and ' seductively ' leaned towards him he was supported by a third @entity17 who said she had witnessed the alleged slapping last year			1
prosecutor @entity54 , said previously : ‘ all this attention was completely unwanted by him			2
as it happens , he is gay and it was upsetting and intimidating for him ... everyone , their colleagues , knew about it			0
that attention upset and intimidated him ’			0
but @entity8 , of @entity63 , @entity12 , denied the allegations , insisting the incidents in question did not happen			1
the former professional gardener denied having any sexual interest in her accuser , telling the court when she took the stand : ' i do n’t find him attractive at all			2
' she insisted she had a good relationship with the man and had ' no idea ' why the allegations had been made			0
@entity8 said she had ' banter ' with other male officers in the shared locker room but remained adamant she had never behaved inappropriately towards or spied on her colleague			2
@entity81 , defending , told the jury today : ' let ’s be blunt about it			2
what the prosecution is alleging is that @entity87 is a sex offender			0
' none of this happened - it is absolute nonsense			0
that is what she ( @entity8 ) told you and she has nothing to prove			2
' the prosecution has criticised her for being forgetful about whether she was ever on the same side of the locker room as ( her accuser )			0
' if this is really the worst she has done , if that is the strength of the case against her then i would suggest to you that even the prosecution know this case is starting to slip			0
' the court heard the changing room was split into male and female areas , and @entity8 would peer around a locker door and stare at the complainant while he was changing			1
‘ male ’ and ‘ female ’ signs were then put up in the changing rooms after the officer complained about @entity8 ’s alleged behaviour			1
prosecution barrister @entity54 insisted the incidents were real and distressing , adding : ' that is the reason ( the accuser ) went to tell his supervisor having thought about it and that is why he was concerned and upset			0
' he ’s told you the truth from the witness box - he ’s not an actor , he ’s not come to lie about what has happened			0
he was slapped and if you ’re sure about that she is guilty			0
trial : @entity8 denied sexual assault and an alternative count of common at @entity16 ( pictured ) ' there was a whole lot of sexual intent , a whole lot of provocative behaviour			1
it does n’t matter whether he is gay , it was what she was doing			0
' speaking from the witness stand , @entity8 's accuser said : ' i was really shocked and i was like “ oh my god ” under my breath			1
i told her “ stop , can you just stop and open the doors ” and she continued - and i think there was about two or three more afterwards			0
' but ms @entity151 told the jury the alleged victim and the witness had both initially said the incident happened in february last year , though @entity8 did not join the same police station until two months later			1
it was later alleged the incident happened on august 18 last year			0
she said : ' for one witness to get that wrong is one thing but for another to come up with the same incorrect month may give you concern			0
' if you have doubt about the truthfulness of that , how do you feel about accepting their evidence about anything else ? ' the jury will return to continue deliberating on the common assault charge tomorrow			1
