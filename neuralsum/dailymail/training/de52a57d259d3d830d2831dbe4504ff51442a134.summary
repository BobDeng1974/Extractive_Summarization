by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the cheerful @entity3 @entity2 joked that @entity4 watching her getting thrashed by @entity5 meant that she was actually ‘ half winning ’ , although the scoreline told a different story			1
before what is now the traditional saturday @entity11 audience of sporting aristocrats she went down 6 - 3 6 - 0 to the no 5 seed , who will be fancying her chances of another @entity17 title on the 10th anniversary of her first			1
although @entity5 admitted she was unaware who @entity19 was in the privileged seats above her on @entity23 , @entity4 is very familiar			2
they have much in common , being among the most commercially savvy high profile athletes of the modern age			0
winner : @entity5 beat @entity2 in straight sets to reach the @entity17 fourth round determined look : @entity5 was in impressive form beating @entity2 6 - 3 6 - 0 on @entity23 ‘ i ’ve actually met him a couple times at different events in @entity35 and in @entity36 , ’ she said			1
‘ he ’s a great guy			0
besides being an incredible football player , there is so much that he ’s done in his career , having a family , maintaining so many things off the court			0
really nice person to chat to			0
' we ’re not best buddies or anything , but it ’s nice to be able to say hello and congratulate each other on achievements we ’ve had in our careers and so on			0
’ @entity4 would doubtless admire @entity5 ’s idea of opening a sweet shop in @entity53 for the duration of the tournament , and he shares with her an ability to compartmentalise the different aspects of sporting and business life			2
she enjoyed competing in front of others who have achieved in sport , even if she did not recognise many of them : ‘ i always feel like i really understand them and actually get star struck more when i ’m around athletes that have done incredible things in their careers , rather than maybe musicians			0
’ more on her mind is facing her next opponent , either @entity75 ’s number nine seed @entity73 and last year ’s surprise semi-finalist , @entity77 of @entity78			2
it is one of tennis ’s stranger facts of recent times that , having won it as a 17 year - old , @entity5 has never added to her tally of @entity87 triumphs while managing two @entity88 at the @entity89 on what used to be her weakest surface of clay			1
she is now looking to become the first woman since @entity94 in 2002 to pulling off the @entity89 and @entity17 double in the same year			2
hit and hope : @entity97 was powerless to stop @entity5 who reeled off eleven games in a row golden girl : @entity5 is bidding to win back - to - back grand slams following her @entity89 triumph in may the chances of her pulling that off rose slightly as she enjoyed a straightforward progression into the last 16 while her rivals had the tedium of sitting it out in the locker room waiting for the rain to subside			1
the @entity112 had the roof to thank for that , and she will not have been unhappy to have been in the temporarily sealed bubble anyway			0
shutting out the elements is good for her game as there is less to interfere with her sometimes unreliable serve , which was in good working order			0
it will need to stay that way , as she is in what is very much the most difficult portion of the draw , full of potential threats			0
faced with world number 44 @entity2 she got off to a slow start and was broken in the very first game , reviving memories of 12 months ago when she was bundled out of the second round here			1
‘ she has had some good results on grass , so i knew it was going to be a challenge , ’ reflected @entity5 afterwards			2
ultimately , though , it was a procession , as from 1 - 3 down she reeled off the next 11 games , accompanied by her trademark shriek that echoed around thanks to the roof			1
@entity2 was overmatched against this 2014 version of @entity5 that moves much better than the old one used to do			1
coupled with the determination that has not been curtailed by so many millions in the bank , you could even see her going all the way next week			0
focused : @entity5 breezed into the fourth round at @entity87 upbeat : @entity5 in confident mood as she targets @entity17 title			1

@entity5 is through to @entity17 2014 fourth round after beating @entity2
fifth seed @entity5 won in straight sets 6 - 3 6 - 0
@entity5 won the last eleven games to close out the match
