by @entity0 published : 04:59 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 06:54 est , 23 july 2013 controversial plans for a second runway at @entity3 costing up to £ 9billion flew into immediate turbulence from residents and environmental groups after airport bosses unveiled their blueprint today			1
they said a new runway in @entity10 , positioned to the south of the current site , could be open in 2025 and could almost treble passenger numbers but be less expensive and less noisy than an extra runway at @entity15			1
it comes after rivals @entity15 and @entity18 both submitted plans to expand to up to four runways			1
the @entity3 chiefs said an additional runway would bring potential investment benefits to @entity24 of around £ 56billion over the period to 2050 , would create up to 19,000 jobs and support wider economic and social regeneration			1
@entity3 unveiled plans for a second runway ( left ) to the south of @entity3 the new runway could be open by 2025 and could treble passenger numbers at the airport also , a two - runway @entity3 would not breach @entity36 and national air quality standards and is backed by key local authorities and business groups			1
the @entity3 plans will be submitted to the government - appointed @entity40 headed by former @entity43 chief sir @entity42			1
the commission is due to make its final report on airport capacity in summer 2015			1
last week @entity48 mayor @entity47 was at the at the centre of a @entity51 jibe row after one of @entity24 's to architects branded his plans for a @entity56 airport on a par with the grandiose projects that @entity59 might have dreamed up			1
sir @entity60 , who is working on @entity3 's bid to build a second runway and who designed the distinctive @entity65 spy headquarters which features in many recent @entity67 movies , said the @entity48 mayor 's plan to build a £ 65billion airport on the @entity56 was ' mad ' and comparable to the sort of project that @entity59 might have dreamed up			1
sir @entity60 told @entity48 's @entity75 newspaper : ' when people say that you have got to have vision , well @entity59 had vision			0
' vision can be a madness where you get so obsessed you throw everything you have got on the roulette table and hope you got it right			0
' @entity59 famously used his personal architect and armaments minister @entity85 to draw up plans on an epic scale for a radically re-designed @entity89 – to be renamed ' @entity90 ' after a @entity92 victory			1
sir @entity60 , who has also designed some of the world 's largest airports and railway stations , said the scale of the proposed four - runway project would be unprecedented in @entity24 and made the government 's @entity100 high - speed rail project ' look like chicken feed '			2
the airport dog - fight came after the mayor underlined his commitment to an estuary airport by naming sir @entity107 's £ 65billion @entity109 plan as his first choice			2
the mayor also wants to shut @entity15 at a cost of £ 15 billion and create a new @entity48 borough for 250,000 residents			1
sir @entity60 's comments escalated the tension between @entity15 , @entity18 and @entity3 as they all this week go public with their rival plans			1
sir @entity60 said closing @entity15 and moving the predominant @entity48 airport to the eastern extreme would mean ' flipping @entity48 ' , adding : ' in that case people say you could make @entity15 a new town			1
it makes @entity100 look like chicken feed			0
it 's going to be the biggest project the @entity24 has ever done in its history			0
' but expansion is vigorously opposed by the @entity130 ( @entity130 ) protest group and the local @entity133 mep who said it would blight homes and mean ' more noise , more pollution and more congestion nearby			1
' under a legal agreement made in 1979 the @entity10 airport can not build a second runway before 2019 – and @entity3 ' insists it will honour that agreement			1
but this runs out in just six years ' time			0
@entity3 put forward three main options for how a southern parallel runway would operate costing between £ 5billion and £ 9billion			2
the airport bosses said none of the options presented significant project complexity or risk and all could open to passengers by 2025			2
depending on which option is chosen , the airport 's capacity would increase from the current figure of 34.2 million passengers a year to between 67 million and 87 million by the 2040s			2
@entity3 said the land required for the construction of a second runway had been formally safeguarded since 2003			2
it is estimated that the potential number of properties lost for the runway options range between 50 and 100 homes at @entity3 , as against 950 to 2,700 at @entity15 if a third , extra , runway is built there			1
also , the @entity3 executives said road and rail access requirements are significantly less than the needs of @entity15 or for the plans for a brand new airport to the east of @entity48 favoured by @entity48 mayor @entity47			1
@entity3 chief executive @entity175 said : ' @entity48 is the best - connected city in the world today because the @entity24 's aviation industry is one of the most competitive and innovative			0
' our proposal to the @entity40 builds on this foundation and would ensure that the @entity24 has an airports policy which offers the additional capacity that @entity24 needs , improves the resilience of the airports system and , above all , can be delivered			0
' he added : ' our evidence shows clearly that an additional runway at @entity3 would best serve the needs of all passengers , and give certainty to airlines , communities and businesses			2
it would deliver the connectivity the @entity24 needs with lower environmental impacts , whilst spreading the economic benefits			0
option 1 : dependent segregated mode : runways spaced closely together - with a separation less than 760m - are too close to operate independently to each other			0
they are dependent on one another			0
so the operations on one runway would temporarily interrupt the operations on the other			2
one runway would be used for aircraft arrivals and one for departures - a method of operation called ¿ segregated mode ¿			2
this method of operation could support around 67 to 70 ¿ movements ¿ ( landings and / or take - offs ) per hour , which could equate to an overall two runway capacity of some 60 to 66 million passengers per year by 2050			2
option 2 : independent segregated mode : if the runways are positioned 760m or more apart the runways can be operated independently of each other			0
this means that arrivals on one runway do not affect departures on the other			2
capacity could increase to around 75 landings and take - offs per hour equating to some 75 - 82 million passengers per year by 2050			0
option 3 : @entity234 : if the runways are at least 1,035m apart , it can then be possible to operate them in ¿ independent mixed mode ¿			0
each runway could accommodate both arriving and departing aircraft			2
in this way flexibility and capacity would be maximised			0
capacity could amount to between 95 and 100 take - off and landings per hour or more and would equate to some 80 to 87 million passengers per year by 2050			0
' a two - runway @entity3 , as part of a constellation of three major airports surrounding @entity48 , will also provide flexibility in an industry where the only constant is change			0
' earlier , mr @entity175 told the @entity255 4 today programme : ' i think there are a number of airlines in this debate with a number of different positions			0
certainly some of the @entity15 airlines , as you would expect , support @entity15 , whereas the airlines here at @entity3 are very supportive of the second runway being built			1
' mr @entity175 admitted that cabinet office minister @entity268 , who represents the nearby constituency of @entity270 , has ' reservations ' about the plans			0
he added : ' we have certainly briefed @entity268 on the plans that we have			0
i think it is fair to say that @entity268 has some reservations about the second runway project at @entity3 but is very supportive of the work that we are doing and will see the detail that we layout today and hopefully that will help to convince @entity268 that this is the right solution			0
' but @entity282 , the @entity133 mep for the @entity283 , attacked the proposals for the expansion of @entity3			0
he said : ' it 's no surprise that the bosses of @entity3 want to build this second runway			0
they are hell - bent on bringing more flights into the @entity24 's airspace and they seem more than happy to gloss over the grave environmental and health implications of airport expansion			1
' mr @entity282 said : ' the residents around @entity3 , who already have their lives blighted by the airport 's noise , will be greatly concerned about the prospect of another runway being built on their doorstep			1
i 'll be joining residents in fighting against the proposal for another runway which would mean more noise , more pollution and more congestion nearby			1
' @entity313 ( @entity130 ) protest group has suggested that airport bosses were announcing a second runway now to drive up the company 's value and share price in advance of a sell - off by some key investors : ' it 's like getting planning permission for a house extension before you sell it			1
and they 've made no secret they want to sell by 2018 , ' said a spokesman .			0

runway could be built to the south of the airport and is being planned to rival @entity15 and @entity18 expansion plans
plans for expansion would be *quieter* than an extra runway at @entity15 and it would not breach air quality standards
however local *pressure* groups are against expansion saying it would create more noise , pollution and congestion
