by @entity1 reporter last updated at 4:53 pm on 24th october 2011 the discovery of a room - dividing screen decorated by @entity4 with 800 images of the great and the good of the day has stunned historians			1
it is believed to have been created in 1850 by @entity9 novelist @entity4 and his actor friend @entity10 to educate the thespian 's children and is a @entity13 of famous people from the 19th century			1
it includes images of the @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , admiral @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
scenes from @entity30 plays like @entity31 were also stuck onto the screen by the two friends who spent hours gluing etchings and prints to the 7ft tall divider at the actor 's home a burn hole caused by a candle shows how someone in the past had been closely looking at it during the night			1
the screen includes images of the @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , admiral @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 conservator @entity44 at work as she attempt to restore the screen after it was donated to @entity47 house in @entity48 @entity4 came into contact with several of society 's most prominent figures during a career that saw him undertake several roles			1
the @entity56 author once worked as a reporter , covering parliamentary proceeding , where he interacted with several politicians			1
he later took up a post as editor of @entity62 in 1846			1
@entity4 used that platform to encourage social transformation			1
@entity65 , together with friend @entity66 helped @entity67 survive financial struggle			1
@entity4 also held ties with several well known figures in @entity71 , @entity72 who led the @entity75 movement of the mid- 19th century , and poet @entity76			2
@entity44 , the expert who is restoring the artefact , said : ' it really is a lovely thing and it is remarkable the difference when the surface grime is removed			2
' it is a very complicated object with multiple layers			2
it has a timber frame with textile stretched across it with etchings and engravings on that			2
' they have been stuck on with an animal or wheat starch glue and then varnished over			2
there have also been running repairs and it has aged and deteriorated and the wood has created acidity			0
' the varnish has discloured and it has been in a room with coal fire and people smoking			0
' i 'm cleaning it with a special gel and also saliva			0
saliva is viscous and has a special enzyme that helps remove dirt			0
' it only works for a short time because it has to be at body temperature , but it lifts the dirt			0
' the descendents of @entity10 recently gave the screen to the friends of @entity117 's old home in @entity48			0
@entity118 , chairman of the friends of @entity120 , said : " the screen was put together in the 1850s			0
' @entity4 and @entity10 were very close friends ; @entity123 was dedicated to @entity124			0
' the family story is that @entity4 would visit @entity10 and together they made the screen , probably to educate the children			0
a close up of images on the screen show @entity17 ( left ) who served as commander - in - chief of the @entity134 until his death and @entity20 ( right ) who died during the @entity136 on closer investigation , playwright @entity30 ( left ) is also seen as well as a portrait believed to be that of @entity31 ( right ) who became @entity140 of @entity141 in 1509 ' it is canvas on a wood frame and the pictures are probably from periodicals and have been stuck on with glue in a large collage			1
' the pictures include the names of the day as well as @entity30 and classical history - things @entity10 would want his children to know			1
' the 10ft wide screen was found among the possessions of sir @entity155 's late mother and was bequeathed to the @entity156			0
@entity120 , was built in 1740 , and is currently being sold by @entity157 which used to run it as a school			0
