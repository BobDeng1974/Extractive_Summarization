@entity0 are set to cash in on @entity3 - winning misfit @entity1			1
both @entity4 and @entity5 are in the running for the winger , who has struggled to make an impact at @entity9 this season			1
but far from a cut - price deal for a talented bench warmer , the @entity11 will expect compensation to the tune of £ 30million for @entity1 , who has made just five @entity16 starts this season			1
the move continues a trend of @entity0 getting top dollar for players unwanted since @entity23 ’s return and the introduction of @entity26 rules			1
here , @entity27 runs the rule over the big - name departures			0
@entity1 looks set to leave @entity0 before the end of the transfer window on february 2 @entity1 is wanted by both @entity4 and @entity5 back home in the @entity33 january 2014 – @entity34 £ 18million hotly - touted @entity35 never saw eye - to - eye with @entity23 since returning from a successful loan spell at @entity38 on the @entity41 manager ’s return to @entity9			1
despite featuring in the first few matches of last season , the @entity43 playmaker soon fell out of favour , with @entity23 slamming his attitude and performance in a @entity50 win at @entity51			0
he barely featured for @entity0 again , the manager frequently becoming irritable in press conferences when asked about his non-appearances			2
when the january transfer window rolled around , @entity35 was first out the door , with @entity0 incredibly banking well over double their money for a player with just two league appearances to his name			1
@entity34 left @entity0 for £ 18million while @entity61 arrived at @entity62 for £ 37million manager @entity23 has seen an incredible amount of money flood into the club over the last year january 2014 – @entity61 - £ 37million a fans favourite straight from the off when arriving from @entity68 in 2011 , @entity61 lit up @entity9 with his creativity , eye for goal and cheery demeanour			1
the diminutive @entity73 led the @entity11 ’ attacking play throughout his tenure of the no 10 shirt , picking up the @entity77 , the @entity78 and the @entity80 trophies along the way			2
however , the @entity83 ’s return was @entity84			0
@entity23 had no time for @entity61 ’s perceived lack of tracking back , and some anaemic displays saw @entity87 take his place in the side			2
@entity90 saw an opportunity to snap up an unhappy , albeit outrageously talented , player , but had to pay £ 37million for the privilege			0
@entity61 has been good in fits and starts at @entity96 , but is often touted as the odd man out in @entity99 ’s star - studded attacking line - up			2
@entity61 has n't been an unqualified success at @entity62 and @entity23 will be pleased with the business @entity102 cost @entity103 a staggering £ 50million june 2014 – @entity102 - £ 50million a player who polarised opinion at @entity9 like no other			1
the big - haired @entity108 left fans in raptures with his fearless play , impeccable technique and larger - than - life personality			0
unfortunately , he also left fans with their heads in their hands at some of his ponderous positional play and dodgy defending			0
@entity23 deployed @entity102 in both defence and midfield last season to varying degrees of success			2
but when @entity103 came calling with an eye - watering £ 50million , there was no hesitation at @entity0			0
his @entity3 performances alongside @entity103 clubmate @entity130 did nothing to disprove the notion that @entity0 got the deal of the century			0
july 2014 – @entity134 - £ 28million hailed as the heir to @entity136 , @entity134 arrived at @entity9 amid a flurry of hype as one of the most coveted teenagers in @entity141			0
@entity102 plays alongside @entity108 national team - mate @entity130 in the heart of @entity103 's back four @entity144 decided to part with £ 28million when signing @entity134 from @entity0 last summer @entity134 was brilliant on loan at @entity146 last season but has since struggled for form goal - laden loan spells at @entity151 and then @entity146 had @entity0 fans looking on in anguish as their own misfiring strikers stunk out the @entity16			1
but @entity23 had issues with @entity134 ’s attitude and technique – the target man ’s passing and first touch some way off what was required for the @entity0 attacking juggernaut			1
getting a shade under £ 30million for him from loan club @entity144 has proven to be a masterstroke			0
the @entity144 have been a shadow of @entity169 ’s men last season , with the @entity43 target man one of the worst culprits .			0

@entity1 is *interesting* both @entity4 and @entity5
the @entity174 is ready to leave the @entity11 , who want @entity176
@entity102 , @entity134 and @entity61 all departed for big money
