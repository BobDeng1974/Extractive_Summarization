@entity7 , 31 , started a blog detailing the one new thing he did every day of the last year - and asked readers to donate a penny for each new thing he did to the @entity12 , after his wife @entity13 lost their first child			1
@entity7 decided to raise money for the @entity12 after his wife @entity13 lost their first child			1
he started a blog detailing the one new thing he did each day of 2012 - here , trying @entity19 food @entity7 asked readers pf his blog to donate a penny for each new thing he did			1
here , being bench - pressed by a friend after a year of completing tasks from the sublime to the ridiculous - ranging from conducting a philharmonic audience to eating a deep - fried @entity7 has raised more than £ 2,000 for the charity			1
and yesterday , on the 366th day of his blog , he touchingly announced he had become a dad - to - be , posting a scan of his unborn child			2
@entity7 , from @entity32 , @entity33 , started the blog after kissing his new wife @entity13 on @entity36 - and realised it was the first time he had kissed his wife in 2012			1
down the hatch : drinking @entity40 milk was another new experience , as was the @entity43 challenge he also rescued a piglet and spent a day flying a hawk he explained on his blog : ' as we drunkenly ushered in the new year in @entity48 , i grabbed my beautiful wife and gave her a big , lickery kiss ! as i did this , i realised i had never brought in the new year by kissing a wife before ! ' in my drunken excitement , i informed my pals that i would bravely keep this up for the whole of 2012 ; trying something new everyday ! ' after @entity13 almost lost her life after suffering an ectopic pregnancy , @entity7 decided to use his resolution to help raise money for the charity which helped them through tough times			1
he said : ' by the time we got to the hospital @entity13 had lost so much blood , we were told she was just hours away from death			2
new acquaintances : meeting newsreader @entity73 on a train counted towards @entity7 's annual tally the 366 tasks , which ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous , even included a nappy changing contest after his year of tasks , including trying archery , @entity7 has raised more than £ 2,000 for charity ' i would give anything to have avoided that fateful day			1
sadly , that is not possible			0
' the resulting surgery meant @entity13 lost one of her fallopian tubes , diminishing the couple 's chances of conceiving a baby in the future			1
@entity7 's new things ranged from simple deeds - like going to introduce himself to his next - door neighbours , or changing the dirty nappy of a friend 's baby			2
but others were slightly more bizarre - including rescuing an escaped piglet at a children 's farm , and chatting to broadcasting legend @entity73 on the tube			2
he 's also turned his hand to archery , and spent a day handling birds of prey at the @entity105			0
after trying a deep fried @entity106 , engineer @entity7 posted : ' i had to have a shower after i finished ... and i still felt unclean			2
each mouthful took a day of my life			0
' one particular low point was the deep - friend @entity106 bar , every mouthful of which @entity7 described as ' taking a year off my life ' fortunately , his barbequed meat was more palatable on january 8 , he wrote : ' finally got around to meeting our neighbours properly - @entity118 , @entity119 & @entity120			0
they rock ! ' and posted a photo of him with his new chums			0
and on may 14th he posted : ' on the train home , @entity13 and i sat next to the legendary broadcaster , @entity73			0
he had just spent the evening at a charity event at the @entity128 , in the company of prince @entity130 and @entity131			0
i expect me and @entity13 were a bit of a disappointment after that ! ' @entity73 was a genuinely lovely fella			0
i ended up booking him a taxi from @entity137 - and boring him senseless with this little blog ! he seemed startled and confused when i told him that that he was my ' new thing for the day ! ' but his thousands of followers were touched when on december 31 , @entity7 wrote : ' became an @entity142 ! today i am proud to announce that i 'm a genuine , bona fide father - to - be			1
and i could not be happier ! getting to grips with wrestling yesterday , on the 366th day of his blog , @entity7 announced he and @entity13 are expecting again ' please remember the reason for me embarking on this bonkers charity project ; a few years ago , my wonderful wife , @entity13 , suffered an ectopic pregnancy			1
it took the life our wee baby , and it very nearly took my wife 's life in the process			0
the subsequent surgery left my wife bereft on one of her fallopian tubes , thereby diminishing our chances of conceiving in the future			0
' although that fateful incident broke my heart , i was grateful that i still had my wonderful wife by my side ! and we never gave up hope ! ' and , as this post proves , i am glad we did n't give up - we are now expecting			0
we have a long way to go , so we are n't counting our chickens before they hatch , but we remain positive ! ' if you have had a similar experience to my wife and me , i hope that this final new thing brings you hope too			0
