when the alleged abuse began , she was 15 and @entity0 was 33			1
@entity0 competed in short track and won a silver medal in the relay at @entity15 in 1994			1
he also served a term as president of @entity18 and is currently chairman of the short track committee for the @entity21			1
abuse ? @entity4 said that she had sexual contact with @entity0 repeatedly over several months in 1997 and 1998 while both were training in @entity9 and @entity10			1
when the alleged abuse began , she was 15 and @entity0 was 33 @entity24 recently returned to speedskating after a six - year absence and is making a long - shot bid for a spot on the @entity30 team that will compete at the @entity31 next year			1
she failed in three previous bids to qualify for the @entity33			1
the national governing body said it was not previously aware of any allegations against @entity0			1
' our current understanding is that it was not reported to anyone at @entity18 or the authorities at that time , ' the organization said in a statement			1
' we intend to look into this matter immediately to determine what action should be taken			2
' there was no immediate comment from @entity0			1
the @entity47 left a message on his cellphone			2
@entity24 's lawyer , @entity50 , said the abuse began when @entity24 and @entity0 were training at the same club in @entity53 , @entity54 according to @entity50 , @entity0 began paying a lot of attention to @entity24			1
he would let her drive his car , for instance , and he also sharpened her skates			2

but @entity73 spokesman @entity72 said , ' clearly , any allegations of such a serious nature need to be fully investigated			0
' in any event , they represent another setback to a powerhouse @entity30 @entity33 sport , coming after a sexual abuse scandal in swimming			1
dozens of coaches have been accused of abusing underage swimmers , including a former national team director , prompting @entity87 to adopt a ' safe sport ' program and go public with a list of everyone who has received a lifetime ban from the organization			2
@entity24 's allegations are somewhat different in that the abuse allegedly began while she and @entity0 were both still competing			2

the statute of limitations for a lawsuit has expired , @entity50 said , so there are no plans to pursue legal action			0

' ' they see their coaches sleeping with girls , ' @entity50 said			0

everybody thinks that 's ok			0

' i knew that because he made it be a secret , ' she said			2
' but i will say that the 15 - year - old thought it was exciting			1
' @entity24 said she did n't tell anyone what had happened for years			0
' the first five to seven years after it happened , i was scared , ' she told the radio station			0
' i was petrified , because i was young and in speedskating , and i was knocking on the door to the junior national team , then the senior national team , and i did n't want to do anything to jeopardize that			0
' then , ' she added , ' there was a period of my life when i did n't say anything because i realized i was hurt , and i was broken			0
' and it took a long time and a lot of work and some pretty dark times to come to grips with it and put myself together			0
' hopes : @entity24 ( circled ) recently returned to speedskating after a six - year absence and is making a long - shot bid for a spot on the @entity30 team that will compete at the @entity171			1
