@entity0 and @entity1 are among the eminent scientists who fear that intelligent robots could be mankind ’s downfall			1
and just days after professor @entity0 warned that ' artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race , ' a team of @entity11 researchers are embarking on a collaborative project to ensure that the autonomous robots we build in the future will make decisions that are ethical and can follow rules			1
robots that can think and act without human intervention are fast moving from fiction to reality			1
there are fears that intelligent robots ( illustrated ) could one day overthrow humans , so a team of @entity11 researchers are embarking on a collaborative project to ensure that the autonomous robots we build in the future will make decisions that are ethical and can follow rules the nuclear , aerospace , manufacturing and agricultural industries are starting to develop autonomous systems that can carry out tasks that are either too difficult or too dangerous for humans , while driverless cars are already with us			1
researchers at the universities of @entity42 , @entity43 and the @entity44 , @entity39 have set up a new project to address concerns around these new technologies , with the aim of ensuring robots meet industrial standards and are developed responsibly			1
the £ 1.4 million project will run until 2018			1
professor @entity52 , principal investigator at @entity43 , said the project will ‘ develop formal verification techniques for tackling questions of safety , ethics , legality and reliability across a range of autonomous systems			1
’ @entity0 has warned that artificial intelligence has the potential to be the downfall of mankind			2
' success in creating @entity67 would be the biggest event in human history , ' he said writing in the @entity71			2
' unfortunately , it might also be the last ' @entity73 has set up an ethics board to oversee its work in artificial intelligence			2
the search giant has recently bought several robotics companies , along with @entity79 , a @entity11 firm creating software that tries to help computers think like humans			1
one of its founders warned artificial intelligence is ' number one risk for this century , ' and believes it could play a part in human extinction ' eventually , i think human extinction will probably occur , and technology will likely play a part in this , ' @entity93 ’s @entity92 said in a recent interview			2
among all forms of technology that could wipe out the human species , he singled out artificial intelligence , or @entity67 , as the ' number 1 risk for this century			2
' the ethics board , revealed by web site @entity107 , is to ensure the projects are not abused			1
neuroscientist @entity109 , 37 , founded @entity93 two years ago with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans			1
the news may be a relief to scientists such as professor @entity0 , who last week warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment			0
speaking at event in @entity123 , the physicist told the @entity124 : ' the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race			0
' this echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating @entity67 ' would be the biggest event in human history , [ but ] unfortunately , it might also be the last			0
' last month , @entity1 , the entrepreneur behind @entity136 and @entity137 , warned that the risk of ‘ something seriously dangerous happening ’ as a result of machines with artificial intelligence , could be in as few as five years			0
he has previously linked the development of autonomous , thinking machines , to ‘ summoning the demon ’			0
speaking at the @entity146 ( @entity146 ) @entity147 in october , @entity1 described artificial intelligence as our ‘ biggest existential threat ’			0
he said : ‘ i think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence			0
if i had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is , it ’s probably that			0
so we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence			0
‘ i ’m increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight , maybe at the national and international level , just to make sure that we do n’t do something very foolish			0
last month , @entity1 ( pictured ) , the entrepreneur behind @entity136 and @entity137 , warned that the risk of ‘ something seriously dangerous happening ’ as a result of machines with artificial intelligence , could be in as few as five years ‘ with artificial intelligence we ’re summoning the demon			0
you know those stories where there ’s the guy with the pentagram , and the holy water , and … he ’s sure he can control the demon ? does n’t work out			1
’ in august , he warned that @entity67 could to do more harm than nuclear weapons			0
the three ‘ laws of robotics ’ were devised by sci - fi author @entity177 in a short story he wrote in 1942 , called ‘ runaround ’			0
they state : as part of the new research project , the @entity184 will focus on the development of ‘ verification tools ’ that will provide mathematical proof about the decisions the intelligent systems will make , allowing experts to check up on future machines ’ actions			1
researchers at @entity196 ( @entity196 ) , a collaboration between @entity198 and the @entity199 , will work on developing and demonstrating ‘ ethical ’ robots			1
professor @entity201 , of the @entity196 , explained : ‘ if robots are to be trusted , especially when interacting with humans , they will need to be more than just safe			1
‘ we ’ve already shown that a simple laboratory robot can be minimally ethical , in a way that is surprisingly close to @entity177 ’s famous laws of robotics			0
‘ we now need to prove that such a robot will always act ethically , while also understanding how useful ethical robots would be in the real world			2
’ the three ‘ laws ’ were devised by sci - fi author @entity177 in a short story he wrote in 1942 , called ‘ runaround ’			0
they state that a robot may not injure a human , or allow us to come to harm , must obey orders given by humans – unless breaking the first law – and must protect its own existence where possible			2
professor @entity224 of @entity225 added : ‘ our project will demonstrate the abilities of robotic systems to take decisions based on ethics , law and safety grounds and provide further guidance to legislators and robot developers			2

researchers at the universities of @entity42 , @entity43 and the @entity44 , @entity39 will address concerns around artificially intelligent robots
their £ 1.4 million project will run until 2018
project aims to ensure robots meet industrial standards and are created responsibly , *allaying* fears that humans may not be able to control them
