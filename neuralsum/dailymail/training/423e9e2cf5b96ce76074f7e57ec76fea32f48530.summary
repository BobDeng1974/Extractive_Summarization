the @entity0 has implemented a points system for the new season in the hope of simplifying the race to @entity5			1
there was some confusion last term when the @entity0 converted euros earned into points ahead of the @entity11 , with each of the final four events of the season having 10million points on offer in the race as opposed to its prize money total			0
that system will remain in place for the @entity11 but throughout the season one euro earned will equal one race to @entity5 point from the very first event - which takes place this week at the @entity26 - until the @entity27 in october			2
northern irishman @entity28 leads the race to @entity5 standings for the 2014 season the enhanced points system will then apply for the @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , with the man with the most points being awarded the @entity40			1
the points will not be reset before the @entity11 like they are for the @entity42 on the @entity43			0
' following the success of the 2014 race to @entity5 , won by @entity28 for the second time in three years after a superb season , @entity44 has decided to implement a points system for the duration of the 2015 campaign , ' said chief operating officer of the @entity0 @entity52			1
the points system will change for next season , with one euro earned equalling one points from first event ' we believe that changing to a points system will help simplify and indeed enhance the narrative structure of @entity46 to @entity5 , and particularly the @entity11 which will again carry a combined 40 million points , with 1,666,600 points on offer to the winner of each event			2
' the conversion to a points system will complement an exciting and robust schedule in 2015 , which will feature a minimum of 47 tournaments , including the addition of five new events			0
' @entity28 won this season 's race to @entity5 despite only taking part in one of the @entity11 following his four victories which included the @entity77 and the @entity78			0

@entity28 leads the race to @entity5 title during the 2014 season
but a new points system will be implemented by @entity0
next season , one euro earned will equal one race point from first event
