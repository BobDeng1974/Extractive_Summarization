by @entity0 published : 20:31 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 06:01 est , 7 november 2012 driving up sales : @entity2 hope to boost sales by bringing out a whole new range of cars @entity2 is embarking on a major new model and investment blitz that could see production more than double to 600,000 vehicles by 2020			1
it has a seven year plan that include a line - up of 16 different @entity2 variations including a family of six luxury @entity15 , five leisure discovery and @entity19 models , and five iterations of the utilitarian @entity21			1
ambitious @entity2 is aiming to capture around 3 per cent of the global sports utility market which experts predict will reach 22 million by 2020			1
the investment is a key part of £ 10billion investment planned by @entity28 over the next five years			0
it means big expansion at the firm ’s @entity32 plant near @entity34 which builds the @entity15 , @entity36 and @entity37 models , and particularly at its @entity39 factory on @entity40 which builds the @entity42 and @entity19 models			1
expansion is also planned in @entity43 and @entity44			0
the firm inadvertently leaked the extent of its proposed 16 - car line up when its design director @entity48 flashed up a slide showing silhouettes of the proposed vehicles on a power - point display during a briefing on its new @entity15 which goes on sale in the @entity55			1
new variants of the next generation of five and seven - seat defender include a ‘ crew cab ’ pick - up truck			2
a soft - top version of the @entity62 is in the pipeline , as well as an even smaller @entity42			0
a new flagship luxury discovery is also touted , as well as a ‘ baby ’ freelander			0
details are revealed in the latest edition of the respected @entity69 magazine and its website www.autocar.co.uk			0
@entity69 ’s associate editor @entity71 who has been briefed by @entity2 sources says : ’ @entity2 is on a roll			0
it is almost certainly the biggest investment that the @entity77 car industry has ever seen			0
@entity78 : the future models of @entity2 were inadvertently leaked during a routine presentation ‘ the new aluminium production line at @entity32 could produce 150,000 models per year at full stretch , which is the most profitable operating position			1
‘ with the new @entity15 shifting just over 40,000 units and the sport about 60,000,it leaves room for a range - topping aluminium @entity2 in a luxury segment that should be able to steal 50,000 of the 682,000 global sales			1
’ of the proposed £ 10billion investment not all will be in the @entity77 , says mr @entity71 : ' about £ 1.8billion will be invested in anew @entity43 plant that will have , in the first stages , have the capacity to build 130,000 vehicles per year , about 60 per cent of which will be @entity2 models			2
' @entity43 is now @entity28 ’s second biggest market , just behind the @entity77 , and @entity43 tastes are increasingly turning away from conventional luxury saloon cars towards sports utility vehicles			1
’ digging in : the @entity37 is one of a string of new models set to roll off the production line @entity2 sold nearly 50,000 vehicles in @entity43 in the first eight months of the year and its 96 @entity43 dealerships is set to grow by a further 47			2
mr @entity71 said : ’ perhaps the biggest area where @entity2 can make headway is in the mid-market ‘ leisure sector ’ where six million annual sales are up for grabs			2
as @entity28 ’s future line - up shows , it needs to build a family of cars in the sector where the current @entity19 and @entity36 compete			1
’ ‘ the new ‘ leisure ’ range would be partly built in the @entity77 – suggesting that @entity39 would need to expand			0
significantly in a few years			0
‘ the new defender family will probably be built mostly in @entity44 , with @entity120 versions using a significant number of @entity44 - sourced sub-assemblies			0
’ the land rover market new lines : this @entity15 from @entity28 ( left ) could soon be usurped by a newer model despite its release earlier this year while last year 's @entity127 could now be up against five new defenders on the market			2
