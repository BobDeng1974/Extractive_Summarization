by @entity0 published : 08:17 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 08:54 est , 22 november 2013 bleary - eyed ministers began a final push on friday to lay the groundwork at @entity5 climate talks in @entity6 for a new deal to stave off global warming			1
negotiators had worked late into the night to try and find some common ground on who needs to do what to meet the un-backed goal of curbing average global warming to @entity15 over pre-industrial levels			0
on wednesday , environment and developmental observer groups walked out , saying the annual round of talks had produced little more than hot air since opening on november 11 , and was ' on track to deliver virtually nothing '			1
the @entity5 climate talks in @entity6 will discuss how nations can help curb global warming , which is chiefly caused by burning fossil fuels the conference is scheduled to close by 5pm today , but many are bracing themselves for another late night 's work			1
involving more than 190 nations , the negotiations are meant to pave the way to a pact by the end of 2015 to limit global warming by taming carbon gases emitted by burning coal , oil and gas			1
on current emissions trends , scientists warn the @entity42 could face warming of @entity44 or higher - a recipe for catastrophic storms , droughts , floods and sea - level rises			0
but developed and developing nations are at loggerheads over divvying up responsibility for cutting greenhouse - gas emissions			2
developing countries want wealthy nations to shoulder a bigger share of emissions cuts to make up for a long history of fossil - fuel combustion			1
the @entity60 , however , insists that emerging economies must do their fair share			1
@entity63 is now the world 's biggest emitter of @entity66 , with @entity67 in fourth place after the @entity69 and @entity70			2
another point of contention is money			0
developing nations are challenging wealthy countries to show how they intend to honour a 2009 pledge to muster up to £ 62 billion ( € 74bn ) by 2020 , up from £ 6bn a year from 2010 to 2012			0
hot topic : developed and developing nations are at loggerheads as to how to help the @entity42 's environment still struggling with an economic crisis , however , the developed world is wary of unveiling a detailed plan at this stage , or pledging new short - term figures			0
the money situation also lies at the heart of another issue bedeviling the talks : demands by developing countries for a mechanism to help them deal with future losses from climate impacts they say are too late to avoid			1
@entity97 nations fear this would amount to signing a blank cheque for never - ending liability			0
the conference did not have many measurable targets , but negotiators and observers had hoped for progress on some of the most contentious issues , and a road map for an historic climate deal in two years ' time			0
by friday morning , with just over eight hours of scheduled negotiations to go , a draft text went so far as to ' invite ' parties to announce emissions curbing commitments ' well in advance ' of the @entity117 meeting where the pact is to be adopted in 2015			0
scientists warn if carbon emissions are not cut , catastrophic storms , such as the recent @entity121 , could become a more frequent occurrence			2

more than 190 nations have gathered at climate talks in @entity6 , @entity127
negotiators have yet to find a *consensus* on cutting down carbon emissions
developing countries want the @entity60 to shoulder the emissions cuts
but richer nations insist emerging nations , *including* @entity63 and @entity67 , must do their fair share
green groups : talks are ' on track to deliver virtually nothing '
