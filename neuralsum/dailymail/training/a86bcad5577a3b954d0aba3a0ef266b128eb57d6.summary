by @entity0 last updated at 11:41 am on 6th november 2011 an asteroid the size of an aircraft carrier is set to pass closer to @entity4 than the moon - the nearest anything this big has come to our planet in 35 years			1
the space rock has been classed as a ' potentially hazardous object ' because it will shave our planet .8 lunar distances away on tuesday , november 8			2
experts have calculated that if something of that size were to hit @entity4 it would cause a 4,000 megaton blast , a magnitude 7.0 earthquake , and if it hit water a 70 - foot high tsunami would spread within 60 miles of the crash site			1
the last time a rock this big passed so close was in 1976 , but it was missed by everybody , including @entity26			1
near - @entity4 asteroid : 2005 @entity27 will shave our planet .8 lunar distances away on tuesday , november 8 @entity26 's @entity30 manager @entity29 said this week that they are to carefully study 2005 @entity27 , which will be 200,000 miles away , because it will give ' clues as to what it was like when our solar system was forming			1
' ' without objects of this type , we probably would n't be here , ' he added			0
this asteroid is in orbit around the @entity41 and has not been this near to @entity4 for some 200 years			0
giant : antennas at the @entity46 radar centre in @entity48 's @entity47 , pictured , will be focussed on the asteroid it will not be visible to the naked eye , but amateur astronomers could see it if they use a telescope at least 6in in diameter as it approaches from a sunward direction			0
encounters of objects this large , this close to our planet , will not happen again until 2028 when an asteroid will pass near @entity4 to within .6 lunar distances			0
@entity26 will use its super-sensitive @entity46 radar antennas in @entity48 â€™s @entity47 , usually used to study quasars , as well as map planets and comets			0
close shave : the 2005 @entity27 asteroid will flash by @entity4 just 200,000 miles away next week , nearly 30 years since the last one of a similar size came past holding secrets : a radar image of 2005 @entity27 captured by the @entity72 in @entity73 last year scientists say they can reconstruct the shape of the asteroid with a resolution as fine as 13 feet using their instruments and plan to do similar studies at @entity72 in @entity80			1
2005 @entity27 was ' imaged ' in @entity80 on april 19 last year			2
the data collected has allowed the @entity82 at @entity26 's @entity83 ( @entity83 ) to refine the space rock 's orbit , enabling scientists to rule out any possibility of an @entity4 impact for the next 100 years			2
safe for now : data obtained from the @entity72 has ruled out the chance of 2005 @entity27 smashing into @entity4 within the next 100 years a @entity26 spokesman said : ' we hope to obtain images that should reveal a wealth of detail about the asteroid 's surface features , shape , dimensions and other physical properties			1
' @entity101 , a scientist at @entity26 's @entity83 added : ' while near - @entity4 objects of this size have flown within a lunar distance in the past , we did not have the foreknowledge and technology to take advantage of the opportunity			0
' when it flies past , it should be a great opportunity for science instruments on the ground to get a good look			0

2005 @entity27 will be 200,000 miles away on november 8
scientists have *predicted* it would cause a giant earthquake or a huge tsunami if it hit @entity4
the last time a rock of a comparable size passed so close was in 1976 , but it was missed by @entity26
