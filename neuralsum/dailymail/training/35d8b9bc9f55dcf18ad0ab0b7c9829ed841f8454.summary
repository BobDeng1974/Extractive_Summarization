by @entity0 published : 13:06 est , 25 march 2012 updated : 13:10 est , 25 march 2012 rescued : @entity1 is starting to enjoy her freedom at the animal sanctuary she has spent the past year cooped up in a council house - about as far from the proverbial happy pig in muck as it is possible to be			1
but now @entity1 , the sow who was discovered living in the small end - terrace home by stunned officials when they tried to evict her owner , has had her bacon saved			1
the @entity14 has tracked her down to an animal rescue centre where caring workers say she is timid , and scared of human contact - but on the road to recovery			0
incredibly , her owner , @entity22 , turned up with the unusual pet in the back of his car shortly after being ordered to leave his council house , and asked staff to look after her			1
they are now seeking to pair @entity1 , named after the pig in the hit film , with a mate before rehoming the couple			1
@entity33 , a veterinary nurse who runs the @entity34 in @entity35 , derbys , said today : ' she does n't like being grabbed or picked up			0
if anyone tries to approach her she runs away			0
' she 's in a stable on her own at the moment because she initially did n't like to be around other pigs , either			0
but she 's coming out of her shell a bit now and wanted to mix with the other pigs we have here			1
we 're taking it one day at a time			0
' it is believed mr @entity22 thought he was buying a micropig when he purchased @entity1 as a piglet around a year ago			1
but miss @entity33 said she was actually a @entity47 , a breed that , although one of the smallest in the world , can grow to two feet tall and weigh 15 stone			0
@entity1 , who now weighs around four stone , was discovered last week when council housing staff forced their way into mr @entity22 's home in @entity58 , @entity59			1
for several weeks , they had been receiving reports of a strong smell coming from the property			1
even experienced workers were shocked by what they found - @entity1 had the run of the entire downstairs of the property , including the kitchen and bathroom , where it is believed she slept			1
the floor was covered in a thick carpet of her mess , and mud			2
cared for : veterinary nurse @entity78 pictured with the pig rescued from a council house in @entity59 on the road to recovery : @entity1 is still shy , but is slowly coming out of her shell when mr @entity22 returned home , he simply put her into the back of his @entity88 in front of the stunned council employees , and drove away			1
he is now thought to be staying with friends , while the council has been left with a £ 15,000 clean - up bill for the wrecked house			1
a spokesman for @entity96 , which looks after @entity98 's housing stock , said they would be pursuing the 44 - year - old for the cost of the operation			1
miss @entity33 , 25 , said : ' a house is certainly not a suitable environment to keep a pig			1
in fact , i was disgusted when i heard how she had been living			2
' they are quite clean creatures , and it would not have been good for her to be living in that mess			2
they 're also social animals , and she would n't have liked living alone			2
' her owner called and asked if we took in pigs			0
he says he does n't want her back			0
we 'll try to pair her up with a mate and then look to rehome them in a month or so			0
' new lease of life : @entity1 is a lot cleaner than when rescuers found her in the council house this little piggy stayed at home : this is the sight that greeted housing officials after they turned up to evict a tenant and found he had been using his council home as a pigsty @entity133 , 41 , also volunteers at the centre			1
she said : ' she 's a bit scared and quite timid			0
she basically does not know how to be a pig			2
' she 's okay physically , but it 's one step at a time right now			0
she simply should just not have been kept in a house as a pet			2
' miss @entity33 said the rescue centre was seeing an increasing number of people bringing in large pigs that they thought would remain tiny for life			2
she added : ' mr @entity22 said he thought he 'd bought a micropig			2
we have had eight come in to the centre in the last six months or so			0
i think people have an unrealistic expectation of what they are buying			0
' they see them on tv and with celebrities , sitting in their handbags , and think they remain tiny			0
but they get much bigger , and then the owners ca n't cope			0
i do n't understand why people buy them			0
' @entity161 think the pig had been kept in the house for more than a year and it is estimated that repairs to the damage of the home will be in the region of £ 10,000 to £ 15,000 piles of junk was found in one of the bedrooms , left , while mud and muck covered the stairs , hallway and door the front room with a dirty red leather sofa , faeces and piles of household junk stacked up on shelves fancy a bath ? @entity96 , which manages council housing in the city , said the tenant was an ' excessive hoarder ' and that some rooms were so full of junk that they could not get in at all the garden is n't much better full of old bits of wood , a barbecue			1
at one point there were two ponies in the garden the house looks fairly respectable from outside but behind the front door it was full of disgusting rubbish			1

' @entity1 ' slowly coming out of her shell after being rescued from @entity59 council house
carpets were muddied and covered in droppings and rooms full of junk
it is thought the pig had been living in the house for a year
@entity98 now trying to trace the tenant who is an ' excessive hoarder '
