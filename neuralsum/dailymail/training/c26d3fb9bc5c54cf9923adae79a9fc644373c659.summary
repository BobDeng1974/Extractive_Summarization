as the king who thought nothing of killing off an inconvenient wife or rival , his place on the history curriculum is assured			1
but few would single out @entity6 as a role model			1
which is why education secretary @entity9 was facing ridicule last night after a bizarre interview in which she singled him out when asked to name her favourite monarch			1
@entity9 said the controversial king was her favourite monarch in the interview with politics website @entity18 , but opted for @entity19 on advice from aides after her first choice prompted surprise the reign of @entity6 , pictured , was dominated by his break from the papacy , and he is said to have carried out large numbers of political executions – 330 in the years 1532 - 40 alone , with some estimates up to 72,000 ‘ well i love the tudor period			1
i think @entity6 , ’ she said			1
the minister quickly withdrew her choice when aides and her interviewer on the politics website , @entity18 , expressed their surprise			1
she said : ‘ shall i change that to @entity19 ? a strong female monarch at a time when there were n’t many examples			1
’ @entity6 ’s reign was dominated by his break from the papacy and the establishment of a reformed , national church			1
but he carried out large numbers of political executions – 330 in the years 1532 - 40 alone			1
a contemporary chronicle says he had 72,000 people killed , although the true figure is likely to be much lower and in line with other monarchs in troubled political and religious times			2
@entity6 ’s most famous victim was the second of his six wives , @entity55 , who he had accused of adultery			1
he also had his fifth wife , @entity57 , beheaded for being ‘ unchaste ’			2
a conservative campaign for new grammar schools came under fire yesterday – from the @entity61 education secretary			0
@entity9 said she ‘ was not sure that separating people at the age of 11 ’ would improve social mobility or transform education			1
she insisted instead that she wanted all the country ’s state schools to do well			0
her comments come after senior party figures called for an expansion of grammar schools to be included in next year ’s general election manifesto			0
home secretary @entity74 and defence secretary @entity75 have backed plans for new ‘ satellite ’ grammar school campuses in their constituencies			2
kent county council has asked miss @entity81 to approve its plans for an extra grammar school to meet demand in @entity85 , mr @entity75 ’s constituency			2
earlier proposals were rejected by mrs @entity81 ’s predecessor @entity88			0
mrs @entity81 told the @entity18 website it was wrong to think that the only way to get access to good state education was to reintroduce grammar schools : ‘ i would push back on that and just say actually we want all of our state schools to be good and outstanding			2
’ his inner circle were never safe and @entity100 and @entity101 were among many courtiers and nobles put to death in a reign that ran from 1509 to 1547			0
@entity106 , chairman of the @entity107 , said mrs @entity81 ’s choice showed appalling ignorance of @entity111 history			1
‘ @entity6 is a figure more akin to @entity113 , the @entity114 leader , ’ he said			1
‘ he was a tyrant			2
he was responsible for the executions of thousands of people			2
‘ he used to burn @entity117 and @entity118 in the same place , on the same day , alongside each other			0
‘ what a fool mrs @entity81 is			0
she has to be kidding			0
it ’s someone who does n’t know her history			0
’ asked in the interview to name her political heroes , mrs @entity81 chose @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 , the last apartheid ruler of @entity131			0
the two men were ‘ prepared to take on the system , having been elected or appointed in that system ’ , she said			0
mrs @entity81 was also asked if this country was in need of glasnost – the policy for openness in government institutions in the @entity141			0
she replied : ‘ the @entity152 system , there ’s no doubt about it , people want to know honestly from their politicians about what can change and what ca n’t change and why we ’re doing things			0
they want to know what motivates us to be making change			0
