@entity1 manager @entity0 believes @entity2 ' has the world at his feet ' after his starring role against @entity5			1
the 20 - year - old left - back left @entity7 in the summer for a modest £ 2.85million and has rapidly become one of the rising stars of the @entity10			1
he has excelled in his early @entity13 performances and earned a whole new level of exposure by starring for @entity16 in the recent international break			1
@entity1 's @entity2 celebrates after scoring @entity16 's goal in 3 - 1 defeat to @entity5 @entity13 ' boss @entity0 believes the 20 - year - old can only get better after impressing for his country @entity2 celebrates with @entity23 after victorious display against @entity25 in @entity27 qualifier @entity2 was a stand - out performer in the 1 - 0 win over the @entity30 and went on to score a fine goal in the friendly defeat by the old enemy on tuesday			1
admiring glances and lofty praise has followed in the wake of those performances , and @entity0 was in no mood to downplay them ahead of sunday 's clash with @entity41			1
' he is a truly fantastic young talent who can only get better			0
he 's a wonderfully gifted young lad who 's got the world at his feet , ' the @entity1 boss said			0
' he 's gone from playing second division football in @entity16 to scoring a goal against @entity5 in a couple of years			1
a 20 - year - old lad playing one - twos past @entity5 players and smashing it in the bottom corner - that will stay with him for a long time , being the proud @entity56 he is			1
' having arrived at @entity1 with little immediate expectation , despite having a breakthrough season in the @entity61 top flight behind him , @entity2 's next challenge is living up to the added attention he has garnered in recent weeks			1
but , having been impressed by his character , @entity0 has no fears on that front			2
' it 's our job to keep him working at it and improving and , if he does , we have one of the game 's outstanding young players here at @entity1 , ' he added			1

' he 's sensible , he 's dedicated and he has a wonderful future ahead of him - no question about it			2
' for his own part , @entity2 is keen not to get carried away			2
it would be easy to do so , having been a part - timer with @entity92 in as recently as 18 months ago and having spent just one season in the @entity61 top division before @entity1 came calling			0
but , while others were quick to lavish him with praise , he was quick to point out areas he could still improve			0
' it 's been a massive rise for me , but you do n't look back - you look forward , ' he said			2
' it meant a lot to score against @entity5 - it was called a friendly but it was far from it - but i could only enjoy it for a minute or two before ( @entity107 ) @entity106 made it 3 - 1 to seal the game			2
' but really i was more disappointed with my defensive play			0
i would have swapped the goal for a clean sheet any day of the week			0
' my game has definitely come on a lot , but there 's plenty to improve on			0
' i 'm still working on the training ground , trying to get tips on the defensive side and practising crossing and picking people out			0
' you 're never the finished article - you 've got to keep improving			0
