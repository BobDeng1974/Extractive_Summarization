by @entity0 at times , @entity1 must feel as though the weight of the world is on his shoulders			0
and his three - year - old daughter only added to the load yesterday – when she hitched a ride on his back as he took her to nursery			1
but she was clearly one burden mr @entity1 did not find the least bit onerous			0
he smiled as he strode down the pavement with @entity14 perched on top of him , after she chose to travel by prime minister rather than use her purple scooter			2
mr @entity1 looked more like the entrant of a gurning competition as his daughter playfully pulled at his face @entity1 was all smiles as he carried daughter @entity14 on his shoulders through the streets of @entity26 the prime minister likes to boast of having a vision for the country but could not see at all during his walk to nursery leaving @entity32 mr @entity1 carried a scooter in one hand while @entity14 enjoyed a bird 's eye view wearing a multi-coloured polka dot safety helmet and with her father holding her steady by the ankles , @entity14 could not resist cheekily covering mr @entity1 ’s eyes , before grabbing his face with both hands and making it clear who was boss			1
but the prime minister still looked every inch the relaxed dad , holding on to his daughter ’s scooter with his free hand			1
unusually for a man who has closely guarded his children ’s privacy since moving to @entity54 , mr @entity1 , 47 , did not seem bothered who saw his display of closeness with his youngest , and this set of pictures has been approved by @entity32 for publication			0
after dropping @entity14 off , it was business as usual for the prime minister as he dashed back for a @entity64 meeting			1
issues on the agenda included @entity67 and public sector pay , where chief secretary to the treasury @entity69 updated ministers on changes being made to @entity74 salaries			0
mr @entity1 has spoken candidly about the challenge of juggling the school run with running the country			0
he said : ‘ maybe once a week , sometimes once a fortnight , tragically sometimes once a month i manage to take my children to school , but it ’s got to be possible to be a decent husband , a good father and a good prime minister at the same time			2
’ when the shoulders became too much mr @entity1 switched to carrying his three - year - old daughter while holding a scooter and a bag in his right hand an aide to the prime minister was also roped in to hold a bag while mr @entity1 had @entity14 on his shoulders every parent will have sympathy for the battle to get toddlers to get a move on in the morning , so it was no surprise that in the end mr @entity1 picked @entity14 up and carried her on his shoulders			1
with her hands in danger of covering dad 's eyes , mr @entity1 was also seen carrying a buggy and shopping bag as they made their way through @entity26			0
asked about being seen on the school run , the pm once responded by saying : ' maybe once a week , sometimes once a fortnight , tragically sometimes once a month i manage to take my children to school , but it 's got to be possible to be a decent husband , a good father and a good prime minister at the same time			2
