@entity0 has confirmed @entity2 captain @entity1 features on a list of @entity5 ’s summer transfer targets			1
as @entity8 revealed on tuesday , the @entity7 champions are considering a £ 400,000 offer for the former @entity10 and @entity12 defender			1
@entity1 has 12 months left on his current contract , with @entity2 owner @entity14 insisting the newly - promoted @entity16 club have no need to sell			1
@entity2 captain @entity1 ( right ) is a summer transfer target for @entity5 and could be signed for £ 400,000 the defender is out of contract at the end of the season but @entity2 are in no rush to sell with @entity5 battling to keep hold of current pairing @entity25 and @entity26 , however , manager @entity0 admits @entity1 is among the potential central - defensive reinforcements being considered			1
‘ he ( @entity1 ) is one of many names we are looking at , ’ the @entity28 conceded			1
‘ i know all about him , of course			2
he is a good player but there is nothing in that right now			2
we are looking for central defenders			2
that is an important target because of @entity26 [ @entity26 ] and also because of the situation with @entity25			1
hopefully we will keep him			2
’ @entity38 has attracted the attention of @entity40 and @entity41 while on - loan @entity26 will return to parent club @entity42 after making his full international debut for @entity44 this week			1
desperate to hold on to both ahead of @entity46 qualifiers which could potentially be worth £ 16million to the club , @entity0 added : ‘ first of all , @entity25 is our player			1
that ’s what we want , to have him through the @entity46			2
‘ he is so important to us			2
he still has things to work on to become even better			2
his chance will come in the future - but he is one of the players we really want to keep			0
@entity5 will face a challenge to keep hold of the services of highly - rated @entity60 defender @entity25 @entity61 is expected to return to @entity42 after an impressive loan spell in @entity7 ‘ @entity25 is the leader in the defence , so he is vital for us			1
any money we could get for @entity25 ca n’t compare with the money we would get from the @entity46			1
‘ @entity26 is a young player , a very good player as well			0
it is easy to get one player in for him , but not so much if we need two			0
that ’s a totally different thing			0
i was delighted for @entity26 he got 30 minutes for @entity44			0
again it shows to other players we are doing something right here , that he has come from not playing an important match , ever , to now playing in the first team for @entity44			0
that ’s credit to him and for us as well			0
’ repeating the view that @entity26 should stay at @entity5 to play @entity79 football rather than risk a return to the @entity42 reserves , @entity0 insisted : ‘ i think it ’s important for him to play , that ’s why we sent @entity85 to @entity86 because he needs playing time			1
i do n’t know if he will play or not , i think he will , but it ’s a very good experience for him , playing at a big club , with pressure			0
and the level is hopefully a little bit lower than here and he will get that experience			0
‘ it ’s the same for @entity95 is so hard to play for , if he gets in there he is a world - class player			0
he is still only 20 so i think he should get more experience here			0
as it is now , he is going to go back to @entity42 for pre-season			1
’ @entity102 winger @entity101 is another target for the @entity105 champions and is available on a free transfer @entity107 , meanwhile , insisted that @entity2 ’ good financial health means there would be no need for them to let @entity1 go on the cheap			1
‘ we have been successful and there will be interest in our players and management team , ’ she admitted			0
‘ but am i confident we can hang on to the majority of the people we currently have			0
‘ we are in a good bargaining position			0
we have a fantastic base on which to build and i hope we can hold as much of that as we can			2
‘ that said , it is a commercial world out there and if someone comes long and offers someone something hugely substantial , then who knows ? ’ as well as @entity1 , @entity0 admitted @entity5 are also trying to tie up players on pre-contract agreements			1
@entity102 ’s @entity133 winger @entity101 is one @entity135 target , @entity0 saying : ‘ we have three players we are thinking of on @entity135 but we have n’t agreed anything with anyone			0

@entity5 are considering a £ 400,000 move for @entity2 captain @entity1
hoops could *struggle* to keep hold of @entity25 while loanee @entity61 is expected to return to @entity42
@entity147 winners claim they have no need to sell
