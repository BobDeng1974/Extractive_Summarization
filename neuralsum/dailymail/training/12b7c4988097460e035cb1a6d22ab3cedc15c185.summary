the soldier on trial for the deadly 2009 shooting rampage at @entity3 refused to put up a fight on wednesday , resting his case without calling a single witness or testifying in his own defense			1
@entity8 could face the death penalty if convicted for the attack that killed 13 people and wounded more than 30 others at the @entity14 military base			1
but when given the chance to rebut prosecutors ' lengthy case - which included nearly 90 witnesses - the @entity16 psychiatrist declined			1
about five minutes after court began wednesday , a day after prosecutors rested their case , the judge asked @entity8 how he wanted to proceed			1
he answered : ‘ the defense rests			0
’ ' the defense rests ' : accused @entity3 shooter @entity27 was slated to begin his defense wednesday but called no witnesses brief : @entity32 was adjourned after five minutes without @entity8 even defending himself snapped ? @entity8 was an @entity16 psychiatrist until 2009 , when he admits to killing 13 and injuring 30			1
he was found guilty today on all counts of against him the judge , colonel @entity34 , then asked @entity8 : ‘ you have the absolute right to remain silent			2
you do not have to say anything			0
you have the right to testify if you choose			0
understand ? ’ @entity8 answered that he did			2
when the judge asked if this was his personal decision , he said : ‘ it is			0
’ @entity34 then adjourned the trial until thursday morning , agreeing to give prosecutors an extra day to prepare their closing arguments			0
jurors were led out of the courtroom			0
@entity8 's move was n't completely unexpected			2
he has made no attempt since he trial began two weeks ago to prove his innocence			0
he also has done little to challenge the narrative of military prosecutors , who showed evidence of @entity8 's laptop being used to search the internet for ‘ jihad ’ and find articles about calls to attack @entity58 in the days and even hours before the nov. 5 , 2009 , shooting			1
he has sat mostly silent , raising few objections , declining to let military lawyers take over his defense and questioning only three of prosecutors ' witnesses			0
several of those witnesses were shot during the attack and recalled hearing a shout of ‘ @entity70 ! ’ - @entity71 for ‘ @entity72 is great ! ’ - inside a crowded medical building before @entity8 opened fire using a laser - sighted handgun			1
@entity8 , an @entity58 - born @entity76 , suggested before trial that he wanted to argue that the killings were in defense of @entity81 fighters in @entity82 , but that strategy was rejected by the judge			1
since then , he has offered little for jurors to consider			0
in fact , during a brief opening statement , @entity8 said evidence would show he was the shooter and called himself a soldier who had ‘ switched sides ’ in a war			1
no go : judge colonel @entity34 refused to allow @entity8 to argue he was defending the @entity81 when he killed 13 people and injured 30 others			1
@entity8 has said little since the ruling paralyzed : a wheelchair is pushed through a secured gate to the courthouse before @entity8 arrived wednesday			2
@entity8 was paralyzed when fire was returned in the 2009 attack lopsided : @entity58 army @entity102 , left , and @entity104 , right , of the prosecution , arrive to court wednesday			1
the prosecution called nearly 90 witnesses frenzy : members of the media are escorted by @entity16 personnel into the @entity113 for proceedings wednesday secured : a @entity115 is stationed outside the proceedings wednesday in which @entity8 rested his case after five minutes , no witnesses , and without testifying on his own behalf suspicions about @entity8 's defense strategy elevated as the trial dragged on , as he leaked documents to journalists revealing that he told military mental health workers after the attack that he could ‘ still be a martyr ’ if convicted and executed by the government			1
yet he never played the role of a high - threat , angry extremist in court			0
@entity8 , who was paralyzed from the waist down after being shot by @entity3 police officers responding to the rampage , did n't get agitated in court or raise his voice			2
but that passive and muted presence convinced his court - ordered , standby attorneys that he was trying to convince jurors to convict him and sentence him to death			0
the attorneys had asked that their advisory roles be minimized , saying @entity8 's defense strategy was ‘ repugnant , ’ but the judge refused			2
scrutiny : media scrutiny has been intense in the case which has drawn the attention of much of the world since the 2009 incident in which @entity8 admits to killing 13 making his case : @entity8 , seen with a beard in court on august 8 , is serving as his own lawyer in the case but has two standby defense attorneys on hand @entity8 began the trial signaling that he would call on just two people to testify - one a mitigation expert in capital murder cases and the other a @entity162 professor of psychology and religion			1
but on tuesday , he indicated to the judge that he would now call neither witness			0
that left even @entity34 raising her own skepticism that @entity8 would seize his last chance to defend himself			0
prosecutors were expected to give their closing argument on thursday , though it was unclear whether @entity8 would do the same .			0
