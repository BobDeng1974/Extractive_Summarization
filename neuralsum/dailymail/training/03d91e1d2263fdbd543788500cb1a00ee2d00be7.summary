@entity2 , 35 , was accused by a judge of ' sheer premeditated wickedness ' for putting innocent lives at risks by targeting @entity8 hospitals			1
he set the fires to cause a distraction before rifling through tills to help fund his £ 250 - a - day crack cocaine and heroin addition			1
he admitted arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered and burglary at the @entity26 and @entity25 and the @entity27 in @entity28 on august 30 and july 15			0
@entity2 - who has appeared in court 65 times for 150 offences - also pleaded guilty to committing the same crimes at the @entity33 in @entity26 on august 29			1
he asked for eight further matters to be taken into consideration relating to arsons and burglaries at other hospitals , hotels and a visitor attraction across @entity41			0
jailing @entity2 at @entity43 today , judge @entity42 said he will serve eight years behind bars and be subject to an extended licence for four years			1
the judge said that ' mercifully ' no - one was killed in the incidents but he added that ' things could easily have gone wrong ' and there was ' real danger ' to people in the premises he targeted , including cancer patients			1
prosecutor @entity55 said @entity2 ’s reign began when he was released from prison last summer after being sentenced to 12 months for burglary			1
on july 14 , just weeks after his release , he burgled @entity60 in @entity61			0
the following day , he set fire to a quilt in a housekeeping storage room at the @entity27 in @entity28 , triggering the automatic sprinkler system , which flooded the area			2
as water cascaded through the ceiling and guests were evacuated , @entity2 stole £ 132 from a till behind the bar			1
it cost more than £ 1,200 to restore the sprinkler system and guests who had their stay interrupted had to be compensated , resulting in a total loss to the hotel of more than £ 3,000			2
days later , on july 20 , @entity2 ’s probation officer issued a recall notice after he failed to abide by the conditions of his release			1
but the following day , he targeted the @entity81 in @entity82 , torching a cleaner ’s trolley , which resulted in another evacuation			2
with the coast clear , he dipped his hand in a till in the beauty parlour before escaping through fire doors - but was captured on @entity90 , which later helped identify him			2
@entity2 ’s campaign was interrupted when he was arrested for shoplifting in @entity93 , @entity94 , on july 26 and returned to custody before being released just under four weeks later			1
he then travelled south to the @entity97 coast , and on august 26 set fire to a quilt at the @entity100 in @entity101 , prompting its evacuation			0
he went on to steal £ 75 from a till , mr @entity55 said			2
the following day , @entity2 visited the @entity104 visitor attraction in @entity101 where another fire was set and he stole £ 50 from a till			1
later the same day , he set fire to clothes at @entity101 ’s @entity108 and , following the evacuation , stole £ 82 from the cafe			1
@entity2 ( pictured left and right on @entity90 ) set the fires to cause a distraction before rifling through tills to help fund his £ 250 - a - day crack cocaine and heroin addition also that day , mr @entity55 said @entity2 travelled to the @entity27 at @entity116 where a quilt was set alight but nothing was stolen			1
however , hundreds of pounds of damage was caused			0
the following day , august 28 , @entity2 torched cotton balls in a cupboard at @entity122 in @entity123 , forcing its evacuation , and took more than £ 200 from the cafe till			1
a day later , another hospital was targeted - the @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity26 , which has more than 600 beds and at the time had more than 1,500 staff on duty			1
mr @entity55 said a housekeeping store cupboard was set alight			0
some patients and staff were evacuated , and the cost of the damage was said to have run to up to £ 15,000			2
then on august 30 , @entity2 targeted a third hospital - the @entity26 and @entity25 , when a fire was suspected to have been set among clothes in the chaplain ’s office			1
five out of six wards were occupied by dozens of patients and staff at the time			0
later , staff noticed that around £ 25 had been stolen from the restaurant			2
however , the cost to the fire brigade was more than £ 2,000			0
with the situation ' spiralling out of control ' , @entity2 surrendered himself by telephoning police in @entity154 the following day , saying he believed he had been recalled to prison			1
one of the arresting officers recognised him from a picture circulated by a senior officer relating to the arsons and burglaries , and he was arrested			0
while under caution , he asked : ' what about the others ? ' mr @entity55 said : ' @entity2 said that he committed the crimes to fund his drug addiction which cost about £ 250 a day			1
among the places targeted by @entity2 was the @entity27 at @entity116 where a quilt was set alight but nothing was stolen			1
however , hundreds of pounds of damage was caused @entity2 set alight a housekeeping store cupboard at the @entity171 in @entity128 , @entity26			2
the cost of the damage was said to have run to up to £ 15,000 he said that he travelled around by train and set the fires close to smoke detectors so that they would be detected quickly			0
' @entity2 said he had no home and had either been sleeping rough or stayed with friends			2
mr @entity55 told the court : ' in relation to the offences at the hospitals , @entity2 said he just wanted the money and did n’t think about the consequences			2
' defence counsel @entity185 told the court that @entity2 did not suffer from any mental illness but had a ' fundamental personality disorder '			2
' what seems to be behind this , and is his only real explanation , is this defendant ’s entrenched drug addiction , ' said mr @entity185			0
judge @entity42 said it was hard to ' understand the evil ' of putting lives at risk for relatively small sums of cash , amounting to just under £ 25 in one incident			1
in mitigation , mr @entity185 said @entity2 targeted premises where there were smoke detectors and sprinklers present , and that he did not use petrol to accelerate the flames			2
mr @entity185 went on : ' this man plainly has been wracked by drug addiction for many years			0
he has taken heroin and crack cocaine since 18 or 19 , and they have plainly been a dominant force in his life			1
' his descent into drugs and crime followed the death of both his parents when he was young , leading him to be raised in care			0
mr @entity185 added : ' to his credit , he handed himself in and he realised that the situation was spiralling out of control			0
' judge @entity42 told @entity2 : ' you are a man seriously addicted to heroin and crack cocaine			1
you have a huge number of previous convictions over the years , many of them for burglary			0
' the real gravity of what you did was this : in order to steal some trifling amounts of money because you wanted drugs , you set fire to three hospitals , having taken great care to get into the premises and identify them , work out where to set fire , cause evacuations , and thus enabling yourself to steal			0
' you gave no thought or understanding to other people in there			0
it ’s argued ... that the fires were started in places where there were sprinklers and fire alarms			0
' he went on : ' it must have frightened vulnerable and sick people , not to mention , of course , the staff			0
it also caused huge losses of money to honest taxpayers to what is a national institution - the @entity8			0
' judge @entity42 said @entity2 ’s actions were ' selfish , dangerous and wicked ' and that an ' eyebrow - raising aspect ' of one case was that he stole just under £ 25 yet caused tens of thousands of pounds of damage			1
@entity2 torched cotton balls in a cupboard at @entity122 in @entity123 , forcing its evacuation , and took more than £ 200 from the cafe till he said : ' in cold - blooded calculation you started fires with devastating results , not from any obsession with fire or pyromania but because you wanted drugs			1
' @entity2 was deemed to be a ' dangerous ' man at high risk of re-offending based on reckless , premeditated behaviour , the judge told the court			1
detective inspector @entity291 , of the @entity26 and @entity292 , said after the sentencing : ' @entity2 put the lives of hundreds of people in danger to steal money to finance his drug habit			1
' his actions were not only criminal , but entirely selfish and it has cost thousands of pounds to rectify the damage he has caused			0
' to force cancer patients to abandon their treatment is nothing short of sickening and @entity2 should be ashamed for causing stress and anxiety to those who are fighting serious illness			2
' it is pure testament to the staff at the various establishments targeted and the prompt reactions of the fire service that nobody was hurt , seriously injured or killed			0
' @entity318 ’s director of service delivery , @entity319 , said : ' any deliberate act of fire - setting is dangerous and @entity318 hopes the jail sentence given today will deter others from this potentially deadly act			0
' while these were small fires , there is no doubt that the quick response and actions of our crew prevented them from turning into a major incident			0
“ our investigators worked closely with @entity335 and the link was soon established , leading us to implement extra precautions at these sites			0
' hospitals are , by their very nature , inherently safe buildings with robust fire precautions built in			0
we have an excellent , long - standing relationship with healthcare partners and we thank their staff and the public for being so vigilant during that period			0
