by @entity1 reporter published : 15:50 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 15:50 est , 15 july 2013 get to work @entity2 : new research carried out in @entity4 suggests that delaying retirement can make people less likely to develop dementia it is the dream of many to be successful enough in their professional life to retire early and enjoy their golden years in a splendid state of carefree relaxation			1
but new research suggests that delaying retirement can make people less likely to develop dementia			1
a @entity4 study believed to be the largest ever of its kind found someone retiring at 65 was about 15 per cent less likely to develop the condition that someone retiring at 60			1
the findings back up previous studies suggesting that continued intellectual stimulation and mental engagement may ward off the tragic cognitive decline caused by @entity28 's and similar illnesses			2
they suggest professional activity may be an important determinant of intellectual stimulation and mental engagement , which are thought to be potentially protective against dementia			2
study author @entity36 and her team at the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) analysed the health and insurance records of more than 429,000 self - employed workers			1
analyses showed that the risk of being diagnosed with dementia was lower for each year of working longer			2
even after excluding workers who had dementia diagnosed within the 5 years following retirement , the results remained unchanged and highly significant , the researchers said in a release			2
' our data show strong evidence of a significant decrease in the risk of developing dementia associated with older age at retirement , in line with the " use it or lose it " hypothesis , ' said dr @entity61			0
' the patterns were even stronger when we focused on more recent birth cohorts			0
' around 35million people worldwide suffer from dementia , with @entity28 's the most common type , @entity64 reported			1
