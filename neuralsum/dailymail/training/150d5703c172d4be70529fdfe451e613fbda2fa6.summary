the victory put real four points clear of @entity11 who slipped up 24 hours earlier against @entity13 and it also moved @entity0 up another notch on @entity4 ’s all - time goals list			1

click here to read @entity29 's full match report host commentator @entity4 have capitalised on @entity11 's slip up by picking up all three points against @entity8			1
the scoreline should have been a lot more but @entity4 were wasteful in attack and @entity36 had an emphatic acrobatic effort unfairly ruled out for offside			1
@entity39 will be happy with the result as @entity4 picked up the three points without having to step out of second gear			1
@entity42 receives a standing ovation after impressing for @entity4			1
he was the best player on the pitch for the 89 minutes he was on the field of play			0

@entity0 gets his goal with an outstanding header past the diving @entity63			1
the @entity66 star shows off his incredible aerial ability to direct his headed effort into the top corner			0
after scoring against @entity8 , @entity36 has now scored against every current @entity60 side - other than @entity4			1
the officials could n't find a reason to rule this effort out ! @entity36 has the easy task of tapping the ball into an empty net after @entity8 fail to clear their lines			2
@entity4 deserve their lead despite not being at their best			2

@entity54 's @entity29 : @entity8 very fortunate still to be in the game			0
@entity0 's missed a hat - trick 's worth of goals and @entity36 's should have stood			1
while it 's 0 - 0 there 's hope for @entity8 mainly because of @entity109			0
you could see him against @entity111 on at the @entity112 and people would watch it			0
@entity111 just shading it at the moment			0
@entity4 have done everything but score			0
in fact , they did score but the officials decided to chalk it off			0
the away side will be confident they can win this game in the second half			0
one goal should be enough for @entity39 's side to take the three points as @entity8 have failed to test @entity87			1
@entity36 's has just had an outstanding effort unfairly ruled out for offside			1
the @entity130 put the ball in the back of the net by executing a bicycle kick however the officials chalked it off			1
@entity137 ( @entity82 , @entity36 and @entity0 ) have failed to really test @entity63 as of yet			1
the trio have shown their quality in small periods of the first 38 minutes of this match but have not really linked up to really drive at @entity8 's defence			0
@entity144 has just shown his strength by using his upper body to muscle @entity109 off the ball			0

still 0 - 0 after 27 minutes			0
@entity4 's final pass has been poor thus far			2
@entity162 just had the time and space to pick out one of his team - mates , however he over-hit his cross			2
how are @entity4 not winning this game ? @entity82 just played a delightful cross to @entity0 at the back post but the @entity66 star surprisingly fluffed his lines			1
remains 0 - 0 with 20 minutes on the clock			0
@entity4 have just tried to walk the ball into the net			0
@entity0 and @entity36 tried to play a neat one - two in the area but the latter should have at least tested @entity63			1

16 minutes gone and @entity4 have failed to unlock the home side as of yet			2
