a group of @entity2 percussionists have become an internet hit with an exhibition of ice drumming on frozen @entity6			1
in minus @entity8 , they found by pure chance that the one metre thick ice has a distinctive and haunting rhythm all of its own , reported the @entity12			1
' i felt like we were playing on the drums that @entity16 has left out for us , alone under the sun on the frozen waters of the world 's most magnificent lake , ' said @entity22 architect @entity21 , 31 , a mother - of - one and organiser of @entity26 percussion group			1
the group use the frozen waves of the lake to make an unusual , evocative melody - but they realised the musical potential of @entity6 only after the wife of one of their drummer 's fell over walking on the ice			1
' she made a very musical ' boooooom ' sound - so nice and deep that her husband , who has a very good ear , said ' hold on , what was it ? how did you make that noise ? '' said @entity21			2
the group went back to the exact spot to record their remarkable percussion recital			2
happy discovery : the group only realised the musical potential of @entity6 only after the wife of one of their drummer 's fell over walking on the ice playing with history : the 25 million year old lake , which freezes in winter , is the deepest and oldest in the world ' i will always remember the first feeling , ' said @entity21			1
' you see your hand touching the ice , you hear the sound , but your mind just ca n't take it in			2
' you can not believe that , yes , this beautiful clear sound is indeed produced by ice			2
' she said some people accused them of faking the remarkable ice music , but it was genuine			0
' some people with several musical educations came to say that we were just fooling people , and it was all made up , which is not true , ' she said			0
ice fun : one of the musicians balances a block of ice on his head cold tunes : they performed close to the popular tourist island of @entity98			0
the sound is not the same at other places on the ice - bound lake ' still , i understand precisely why not everyone could believe it was for real			1
' when i first realised @entity6 's musical potential i , too , well remember the feeling on overwhelming excitement and joy - but also disbelief			1
' their performance was made in march on the frozen waters close to the popular tourist island of @entity98			0
evidently , the sound is not the same at other places on the ice - bound lake			1
' people later asked us how we found the spot where different bits of ice sounded so much in harmony with each other , ' she said			0
' the answer is , i do n't know			0
this is just how was			0
' this is perhaps what i mean by saying about it being the wonder of @entity16 , that all we had to do was to discover that place , get there , and start playing			0
' everything else was ready , arranged for the most perfect harmonious sound			0

in minus @entity8 , they play one metre thick ice which has a distinctive sound
the 25 million year old lake is the deepest and oldest in the world
released musical potential of ice when a member of the group fell on it
