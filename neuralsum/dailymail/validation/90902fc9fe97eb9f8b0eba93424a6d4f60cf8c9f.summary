warm applause fluttered around @entity1 as @entity2 slowly jogged up the touchline in the first half , but on the pitch @entity5 was putting in a performance to indicate he is in no mood to step aside anytime soon			1
@entity10 ’s selection of @entity5 ahead of the in - form @entity2 in @entity11 @entity13 qualifier against @entity14 divided opinion across the nation ahead of kick - off			1
should he have started the hot - shot @entity19 striker , joint - top in the @entity21 with @entity22 on 19 and with 29 in all competitions ? or @entity5 who has been performing well for the national team but in - and - out of @entity26 ’s starting line - up , struggling to eight goals in 34 ? @entity5 leads the celebrations after putting @entity11 2 - 0 ahead against @entity14 on friday @entity5 's header deflects into the back of the net to send @entity11 into a commanding lead @entity5 is congratulated by @entity11 captain @entity33 after scoring his sixth of the qualfying campaign former @entity11 striker @entity36 thought the former			1
‘ gutted that @entity2 's not starting , ’ he said before kick - off , ‘ 29 goals , form of his life			2
’ but within six minutes , the @entity26 man had justified the choice with a huge hand in the opener			0
@entity5 started on the left , but was to the right of goal when he nutmegged @entity14 ’s @entity50 with some nifty footwork and fired a shot across goal , which keeper @entity54 could only parry into the path of @entity33 to head in			1
he almost set up a second on 19 minutes , again getting to the byline on the right before crossing deep to @entity33 , who looped a header back across goal and on to the post			0
@entity5 was bright and alive around the box and got the goal his first - half performance deserved just before the break			1
@entity66 crossed from the left and he diverted it in off a shoulder via a deflection			0
@entity5 caused the @entity73 defence problems all evening and justified his selection @entity5 is congratulated by former @entity75 team - mate @entity33 after doubling the lead @entity2 may be the latest boy wonder , yet @entity5 is the top - scorer in this @entity13 qualifying campaign			1
his goal moved him to six for the tournament , clear of @entity82 ’s @entity81 on five			0
doubles against @entity84 and @entity85 , a goal versus @entity87 and another against @entity14 is not a bad return			2
say what you will about the strength of the opposition , but players can only score against what is put in front of them			0
@entity10 certainly recognised his value , choosing @entity5 as one of only four players - alongside @entity33 , @entity100 and @entity101 - to start from the last team he picked			2
@entity103 , as he was dubbed by @entity104 providing a nickname that went viral , did not let his manager down			0
he was close to adding another on 41 minutes , riding a challenge and bending a shot towards the top right corner from the edge of the box which was narrowly over			0
@entity5 is the first to congratulate debutant @entity2 after scoring two minutes after coming on @entity5 celebrates with @entity33 after he turns home the rebound after the @entity26 striker 's effort was saved and again in the 54th , beating two men on his way into the penalty area to the right of goal and powering a shot on target which was pushed out for a corner			1
he would surely have had a second had @entity124 not arrived in the box a fraction earlier to tap in @entity11 ’s third			0
this may only have been @entity14 , the team ranked 94th in the world , but @entity5 ’s passing was crisp and accurate , his runs inventive and movement fluid			2
an indication of his confidence was a clever back - heel flick in the middle of a quick @entity11 passing exchange early in the second half			0
@entity11 ’s front three of @entity5 , @entity33 and @entity124 were swapping places all evening causing havoc to @entity14 ’s defenders			1
@entity5 was substituted for @entity143 in the 77th minute , but the sponsors had seen enough to vote him their man - of - the - match			0
@entity2 may have scored within two minutes of coming on , but , for now , @entity5 will be going nowhere in the big games .			1

@entity11 beat @entity14 4 - 0 in a @entity13 qualifier at @entity1 on friday
@entity5 had a hand in the first goal and scored the second
