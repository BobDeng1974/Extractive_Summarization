@entity3 , 19 , was told she could not compete for a place in the @entity1 competition in the local heats in @entity6 because the rules of the contest ban mothers and married women from taking part however the mother - of - one was disappointed when her older sister got to the next round round and she did not			1
she was told this was because she has a daughter @entity25 , three , and there are rules banning mothers taking part			1
' this rule sends out the message that there 's no beauty in women after birth and that young mums ca n't be good role models , ' said miss @entity3			1
' i think that 's discrimination towards women with babies			2
' the @entity1 beauty pageant claims the rule is in place to protect young families because the busy schedule for contest winners is not compatible with having a settled home life			1
but critics say it is a choice for each individual candidate to make on whether they feel they have enough time to commit to the role and have blasted the regulations as ' old fashioned and discriminatory			2

' i 'm attending college , i do extra-curricular courses and i do a part - time job that i travel around @entity6 and the @entity66 for , ' she added			2
' i do n't think it 's fair that because i have a baby i should n't be able to enter the @entity70 @entity6 contest			1
' i do get a lot of negativity about young mothers , and especially the perception of single mothers , but i hope to prove everyone wrong			1
' if @entity77 was n't here right now , i think i would be a different person			0
' she makes me feel more positive and gives me the confidence to go out and do things			0
' it 's a new day and age , but the organisers of the competition do n't seem to recognise that			2
' they 're trying to say women with children can only be housewives			2
women should be able to go out there , seize opportunities and create a better life			2
' that 's the example i want to set my daughter			0
' @entity13 and i are still very close and if she wins i will be happy for her			0
we do argue but just about silly things			0
this has n't caused any arguments			0
' her older sister @entity13 works at @entity103 and juggles life as a full - time university student and part - time carer for her mother			0

i do n't fit into those rules			0
people have challenged this rule before but we are not changing it			0
' the rule has led to criticism from previous winners			0
last year @entity151 , who wore the coveted sash in 2012 , urged organisers to ditch the rules banning mothers and married women .			1

@entity3 , 19 , decided to enter a @entity70 @entity1 contest with her sister
went to local auditions in @entity6 and was told she could compete
but she was *barred* from competition because she has a daughter
competition small print says mothers and married women can not enter
