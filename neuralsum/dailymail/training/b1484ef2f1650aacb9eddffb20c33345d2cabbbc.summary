by @entity0 children 's diseases tend to spread across @entity4 from one coast to another , researchers say			1
they plotted the progress of a range of conditions including @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			0
they say the weather is key to the spread			1
scarlet fever peaked in @entity18 a month later than in @entity19 , @entity16 found - and epidemics peaked in dec - @entity21 in the @entity22 and @entity23 in the rest of the country			1
the colours represent the number of cases - with dark blue being worst hit , and white having no cases			1
@entity11 epidemics peaked in dec - @entity21 in the @entity22 and @entity23 in the rest of the country			2
diphtheria epidemics peaked in nov - dec in the @entity22 , and @entity34 in the rest of the country			2
with @entity37 , a summer epidemic , the pattern was latitudinal with epidemics in the @entity40 ( august ) occurring about a month prior to more @entity42 states ( september )			2
this same pattern in epidemic timing was seen in @entity12 , with august peaks in the @entity46 , and late september peaks in the @entity48			0
' i was interested in examining whether the timing of these childhood infections peaked at different times of the year across a spatial scale , ' @entity16 , who led the study at the @entity50 , told @entity56			0
he found that in the @entity4 , the wintertime epidemics hit first in the @entity58 , and then spread northward during the 1920s to the 1950s			1
for example , scarlet fever peaked in @entity18 a month later than in @entity19 , @entity16 found			0
@entity10 followed the same pattern , but the disease spiked about a month before scarlet fever			2
' interestingly , in the case of @entity10 and @entity11 , epidemics peaked in the @entity58 a few months prior to the rest of the country , ' @entity16 said			1
the study relies on more than a century of newly digitized infectious - disease records from the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) to provide a comprehensive view of disease patterns researchers hope the maps could help spot the diseases spreading in future outbreaks			1
he hopes the maps could help spot the diseases spreading in future outbreaks			0
' overall , i am interested in the mechanisms driving these patterns , and why we see these geographic patterns in these 4 diseases			0
' this is important because many of these diseases are still endemic in parts of the world , and understanding why the epidemics are peaking across space could help us reduce this disease burden			1
' @entity11 epidemics peaked in dec - @entity21 in the @entity22 and @entity23 in the rest of the country , @entity97 said , while @entity10 epidemics peaked in nov - dec in the @entity22 , and @entity34 in the rest of the country			0
with @entity37 , a summer epidemic , the pattern was latitudinal with epidemics in the @entity40 ( august ) occurring about a month prior to more @entity42 states ( september )			0
this same pattern in epidemic timing was seen in @entity12 , with august peaks in the @entity46 , and late september peaks in the @entity48 .			0
