@entity0 , 62 , shot brothers @entity11 and @entity13 , 60 and 61 , on saturday as they were *inspecting* a shed on their property
@entity0 claimed the men were breaking into his shed so he shot them with a rifle from inside his own home and only called 911 afterward
while the @entity58 brothers are black and @entity0 is white , *authorities* do n't believe race was a *factor* in the attack
@entity0 has been charged with two counts of first degree murder
