the number of children in care has risen to a record level following the death of @entity5 and a spate of child exploitation scandals , a watchdog reported yesterday			1
the @entity9 said the care system for children has not improved under the @entity12 and called on the @entity13 , which is in charge of the system , ‘ to break this pattern ’			1
children are still shunted between foster and care homes , and many are sent to live many miles from their original homes			0
the number of children in care has risen to a record level following the death of @entity5 ( pictured ) they are a quarter as likely to get good school exam results as other children , and more than a third end up at the age of 19 without jobs or the hope of qualifications			1
the @entity9 inquiry comes six years after the @entity5 trial , which convicted the mother of 17 - month - old @entity38 , her boyfriend and his brother for involvement in his death			1
@entity38 had been seen 60 times by @entity45 social workers , @entity47 workers and police officers , none of whom acted to prevent his death			0
since then the number of children taken into care by social workers has risen 15 per cent and this year there were a record 68,840 living in children ’s homes or with foster parents			0
flowers and tributes were left for @entity5 on the second anniversary of his death - since he died the number of children taken into care by social workers has risen 15 per cent but the @entity9 , which is responsible for examining @entity65 spending , said the government ‘ can not demonstrate that it is meeting its objectives ’ for children in care			1
‘ the long - term consequences of such children not getting the right care are poorer outcomes for them and increased costs to taxpayers , ’ it said			1
the report said the £ 2.5 billion spending on the care system in 2012 - 13 was a three per cent rise in two years			2
the @entity9 said the government ‘ can not demonstrate that it is meeting its objectives ’ for children in care however , councils were under pressure ‘ because of a rapid rise in children being taken into care , following the widely - reported abuse and death of @entity5 in 2007 , while many local authorities expect or are already experiencing a rise in referrals linked to child exploitation scandals ’			1
on average , it costs between £ 29,000 and £ 33,000 a year to place a child with foster parents , the method used to look after three quarters of the children in care			0
a place in a children ’s home costs more than four times as much , between £ 131,000 and £ 135,000 a year on average			0

more than a third of children in residential homes live more than 20 miles from their original home			0
@entity116 , head of the @entity9 , said too many children are not getting the right placements the first time			2
‘ if their complex and challenging needs are not correctly assessed and tackled , the result is likely to be long - term detriment to the children themselves as well as cost to society , ’ he said			0
‘ no progress has been made in the last four years			0
