peering over a classmate 's shoulder during a game of chess , this is the boy who would become the merciless terrorist butcher @entity6			1
the image , exclusive to @entity8 , shows ten - year - old @entity9 in his last week at @entity10 primary school in @entity12 , @entity13			1
the @entity13 schoolboy , who moved to the capital from @entity16 when he was six , was revealed this week to be the vicious killer known as @entity6 who has featured in six @entity18 beheading videos			1
' i do n't know what happened in his life to turn him into this			0
this was the last week of @entity31 and we were having fun before going our separate ways			0
' it has been claimed he was ' never the same ' after suffering a serious head injury when he ran into a goal post as a child , according to a former classmate			2
the executioner agreed with @entity44 's massacre of @entity45 and called them ' f * * * king pigs ' , another said			2
while some former peers say they are struggling to believe the quiet boy they knew turned into one of the world 's most notorious killers , others have spoken of a boy with extreme beliefs and a thirst for blood			2
@entity9 appears as a picture of innocence in this school photo after moving to @entity13 , he appeared to embrace @entity64 life - playing football in the affluent streets of @entity13 while supporting @entity66			1
but a former classmate at @entity70 primary school in @entity12 , @entity13 , told @entity71 : ' we were in the playground and @entity9 was running away from someone , i think he was just about to get into a fight			1
' and as he was running , another guy blocked his path			0
and he ran into a goal post and hit his head on a metal goal post and fell to the floor			0
' this was year 6 - we did n't see him for six weeks			2
he was not the same ever since that brain injury			0
i am telling you one million per cent			0
he was not the same '			0
a former friend of the terrorist , who met him in 1999 when they both attended @entity89 in @entity90 , @entity91 , said he found out @entity9 was a @entity93 sympathiser during a year 9 lesson			1
the 27 - year - old told the @entity96 : ' the teacher told us the @entity99 drew up plans to get rid of all the @entity45			2
' i heard @entity9 mutter " @entity101 , they deserved it "			1
i thought he was joking but later he told me that he hated all jews and blamed them for the plight of @entity106			0
' the school friend said that if they ever walked past a house in @entity110 that @entity9 knew was owned by a jew , he would shout obscenities such as ' f * * * king pigs '			2
these anecdotes appear to be reinforced by what details have emerged of @entity9 's adult life			1
just over a decade after the picture of him at school was taken , he was pictured attending a hate - filled rally where one of the killers of drummer @entity124 gave a speech			1
@entity9 is said to have attended the demonstration outside the @entity127 in @entity128 in 2009 to ' celebrate ' the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks			1
during the rally , which attracted at least 1,500 people , @entity131 spoke to the crowd of his contempt for ' unbelievers '			2
@entity131 - who is in prison for @entity124 's murder - said : ' they are pigs			2
@entity140 says they are worse than cattle			0
do not be scared of them			0
and do not turn your back to them			0
do n't be scared of them , or police , or the cameras			0
' onlookers said they also saw a tall @entity16 man , believed to be @entity9 , masked with a scarf , and holding aloft a black flag with the @entity154 testimony of faith in @entity156			1
the flag is usually associated with extremists and jihadis			0

@entity131 spoke at the radical 2009 rally which was attended by @entity9 scarce details of @entity175 have emerged in the past week after he was named as the notorious @entity18 killer , but together , they paint a picture of a man tormented by run - ins with @entity64 security services as he became increasingly radicalised			1
it has now emerged @entity175 was involved with a violent street gang who targeted the wealthy residents of @entity186 with stun guns , and was a member of a secret @entity190 sleeper cell based in @entity64 called @entity191 , which planned to carry out atrocities in the @entity13			2
