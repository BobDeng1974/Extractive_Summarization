wind turbines are often bemoaned for their unsightly appearance , noise and danger to local wildlife - but what if we put them underwater ? that ’s exactly what @entity10 - based company @entity9 , owned by @entity11 , plan to do with their initial £ 51m underwater turbine project			1
by the end of the year they plan to install turbines off the @entity18 coast and they say the technology could be used as a more environmentally friendly source of green energy in future			1
by the end of the year they will begin the project at @entity29 , @entity18 the location of the turbines will be @entity29 , home to some of the fastest flowing marine waters in the world at 18 miles an hour			1
it ’s thought that harnessing its energetic waters could power up to a third of @entity18			1
the turbines will be lined up 525ft ( 160 metres ) apart , weighted down by scrap metal			0
as the water depth in the @entity29 is about 130ft ( 40 metres ) , small craft will be able to sail over the area of about four square miles ( 10.4 square kilometres ) without fear of hitting them			2
when complete in 2020 , the @entity29 project will generate enough electricity for 400,000 homes			2
there are further plans to exploit the @entity29 over the next two decades , installing 1,000 turbines that will generate 1.6 gigawatts of energy , enough for more than a million homes			2
because the waters are so rough , little fishing takes place and there is no danger to fish life as the blades revolve so slowly			0
the turbine farm , which will be clearly marked on charts , is well away from sensitive military areas where @entity66 submarines operate			0
the first turbines are set to be placed at the turn of the new year , with more being placed over the next few years			0
unlike wind turbines , underwater turbines would never be ‘ off ’ as there is a constant flow of water			2
@entity9 ’s turbines are slightly smaller than their land counterparts but generate a similar amount of electricity a year - about one megawatt - and the company plans to eventually build several hundred			1
this would be enough to power 175,000 homes			0
they rotate 12 to 14 times a minute , while compared to regular wind turbines they are slightly more ‘ stubby ’ with smaller blades			0
speaking to @entity90 , @entity89 ceo @entity88 said he hoped phase 1 of construction would be completed by the end of 2016			1
he explained that the turbines will be about 0.9 miles ( 1.5km ) from the shore and they will be ‘ on a par with wind turbines ' in terms of their productivity			0
‘ the costs are higher but this is brand new technology , ’ he adds			0
‘ we have to make it work first			0
’ @entity29 is home to some of the fastest flowing marine waters in the world			1
however , because the waters are so rough , little fishing takes place and there is no danger to fish life as the blades revolve so slowly @entity115 's technology ( shown ) is not entirely new , but its location is an innovative way to use tidal power , using the relatively uninhabited area of @entity29 to provide cheap and clean energy to the @entity121 mr @entity88 is also adamant there wo n’t be significant danger to nearby marine life			1
and @entity9 ’s project will be in quite shallow water , meaning the turbines can be dropped down by a crane			1
by the early 2020s they want to deploy up to 398 megawatts of offshore tidal stream turbines for the @entity121			0
and there are further plans to exploit the @entity29 over the next two decades , installing 1,000 turbines that will generate 1.6 gigawatts of energy , enough for more than a million homes			0
each turbine ( shown being lowered ) is about as productive as a wind turbine , if not more			1
as they are underwater the water always flows and they are never ' off '			0
cost will be higher but ceo @entity88 tells @entity90 this will reduce			1
by the 2020s they could have enough to power a third of @entity18 .			2

@entity10 company @entity9 are planning to place turbines underwater
by the end of the year they will begin the project at @entity29 , @entity18
this is home to some of the fastest flowing marine waters in the world
each turbine is about as productive as a wind turbine , if not more
as they are underwater the water always flows and they are never ' off '
cost will be higher but ceo @entity88 tells @entity90 this will reduce
by the 2020s they could have enough to power a third of @entity18
