by @entity1 reporter published : 10:37 est , 2 december 2013 @entity3 : 10:54 est , 2 december 2013 a 12 - year - old girl who was threatened with expulsion from school for refusing to cut her natural afro hair has been told she can return to the classroom without having to have a snip			1
@entity10 , who is a student at @entity12 ’s @entity11 in @entity13 , had been suffering taunts over her hairstyle from fellow students			1
when her mother , @entity18 complained about the issue , surprisingly , school administrators appeared to side with the bullies and told @entity10 that her hair violated school dress codes for being a ‘ distraction			1
at the time she said that she felt her hair was part of her identity and for that reason , did not plan to change it			1
now it appears that school officials have relented against their insistence that @entity10 cut her hair and have welcomed her back into the classroom			1
@entity10 and her hair were addressed sunday during a church service sermon at a faith - based assembly			1
' we hope that the student and that we would put this behind them and continue to excel in the @entity66 eduction , ' said school board member @entity36			2
we want her back and we are not asking for any alterations and we want her back			2
' @entity36 told local 6 school leaders changed their stance over the @entity73 break , saying they want her to return even with her current hair style			1
@entity10 now hopes she can move on without being taunted by other students			0
‘ it says that i ’m unique , ’ @entity10 told @entity76			0
‘ first of all , it ’s puffy and i like it that way			0
i know people will tease me about it because it ’s not straight			0
i do n’t want to fit in , ’ she continued			0
ms @entity18 says that school administrators targeted @entity10 after she approached them about the excessive teasing @entity10 was receiving from fellow students over her hair			1
self perception : @entity10 says that she does not want to cut her hair because it is part of her identity school officials initially pointed out that @entity10 's hair violated school policy stating that ‘ hair must be a natural color and must not be a distraction , ’ and cites mohawks , shaved designs , and rat tails as distracting examples			2
the school says that @entity10 ’s hair qualifies as a distraction			2
@entity10 's mom , ms @entity18 said the policy required a wide interpretation : ‘ a distraction to one person is not a distraction to another			0
you can have a kid come in with pimples on his face			0
are you going to call that a distraction ? ’ @entity10 's mother , @entity18 , said her daughter was happy to return to school			0
she said she did n't want her daughter in the spotlight anymore and should the bullying or teasing continue , she would take further action .			0
