@entity0 died from colon cancer , which kills nearly 700,000 people worldwide each year @entity0 died from colon cancer - the fourth biggest cancer killer worldwide , causing on average 694,000 deaths each year			1
in countries such as the @entity8 and @entity9 , more than 80 per cent of cases occur in people aged 60 or over , such as @entity0			2
the actress and tv presenter had been diagnosed with colon cancer a little over a year ago			1
the disease later spread to her lungs and liver			1
despite knowing she may only have weeks to live , her death was quicker than many had expected			1
@entity0 , 66 , was expecting to live until january 2015 , and had planned to spend one last @entity21 with her family			1
writing in @entity23 last month , she said : ‘ i would love to make one more @entity21 , if possible , but i want to stop taking chemo around november in order to pass away by the end of january			1
’ her death came just days after she made an emotional return to tv show @entity28 - where she used to be a panellist - for one final appearance			1
this morning , it was announced the much - loved actress and tv presenter died yesterday			1
her husband @entity34 was by her side in a @entity37 hospital			0
such a rapid decline is unusual , but not uncommon , oncologist professor @entity38 told @entity40			0
he said : ' it 's how most cancer patients want to die - where the final episode is very short			1
' it 's not uncommon for people to be very well one day and die shortly afterwards			0
' he explained there are many reasons why cancer patients die			1
ultimately , however , as the cancer grows , the burden becomes too much for the body			1
' in the end , multi-system failure occurs - with vital organs such as the liver and kidneys slowing down and then packing up			1
' no one knows exactly what causes it			0
' he added that different patients die at different stages of the disease			1
this may be the differences in biochemistry , or sometimes , a will to live			2
' there are people who realise they are n't going to make it , just curl up and want to die			0
' then there are those who are the opposite - they want to make it to their daughter 's wedding , make themselves live and die shortly afterwards			2
' @entity0 's death came just days after the she made an emotional return to the tv show loose women for one final appearance , where she appeared lively and in good spirits the spread of the cancer - known as metastasis - is very often what ends up killing patients			1
metastasis is when cells from a tumour separate from it , find their way into the lymph system or the bloodstream , and spread throughout the body			2
particular types of tumours often spread to particular organs			2
in bowel cancer patients , it tends to be the liver			1
this is because the main vein that drains the bowel goes to the liver , explains professor @entity38 , founder of @entity111 @entity8			2
this can disrupt the delicate balance of chemicals and salts in the body - with fatal consequences			0
when cancer spreads to the lungs , there is eventually insufficient healthy tissue to absorb oxygen			1
cancer can block off part of the lung			2
this area may collapse and become infected , which can lead to death			0
' however it is possible there was a medical emergency , ' he adds			0
' the bowel may have become obstructed - there could have been internal bleeding			0
' cancer patients are also more likely to suffer from blood clots			2
if a clot gets into the lung , for example , it can trigger a pulmonary embolism , which can be fatal			0
@entity0 , with sons @entity34 , @entity144 , her step - son @entity145 and husband @entity146 , had wanted to spend one last @entity21 with her family bowel cancer does also not respond as well to chemotherapy as some other cancers , such as breast , explained professor @entity38			1
this is because it very quickly becomes resistant to it			0
appearing on @entity156 's @entity155 two weeks ago , @entity0 discussed how she had planned to stop chemotherapy in november , due to the severe side effects she had suffered			1
she said : ' there 's no getting away from it with chemo - the ulcers in your throat , the thrush , plus the fact i 'd had major , life - saving surgery for a perforated colon			1
colon cancer is also referred to as bowel cancer or rectal cancer			1
in countries such as the @entity8 and @entity9 , more than 80 per cent of cases occur in people aged 60 or over , such as @entity0			0
people who are older , who eat a diet low in fibre and high in fat , those who are overweight and those who take little exercise are most at risk			0
smoking , alcohol and a family history of the disease also increase the risk			1
the cancer can present itself in a number of ways , explains dr @entity189 , a consultant gastroenterologist , and clinical director of the @entity192 in @entity193			2
‘ the usual symptoms are rectal bleeding , a change in bowel habits - usually looser stools , though it could also cause constipation or needing to go to the toilet more frequently - abdominal discomfort and anaemia			0
’ he says if any bleeding is accompanied by a change in bowel habits , or if any other signs persist for several months , then a ‘ full clinical assessment ’ should be carried out			0
this includes a colonoscopy - where a tiny camera is inserted into the colon			2
it ’s also important to establish if a patient has a family history of bowel cancer as this can increase the risk			1
' when you 're in terrible pain , you make decisions			0
' she told hosts @entity222 and @entity224 : ' i want my husband and children to see me off happy , contented			0
' so i put the chemotherapy in a box			2
' in this box , i could stop the chemotherapy after @entity21 - i 'm determined to hang on until @entity21			1
' if my quality of life fades after that , i want to be able to open the box , make a choice and stop the chemotherapy			1
' she said before this , she 'd had no control over the decision - but had struggled with the idea of refusing treatment offered			0
' i do n't want to look ungrateful , ' she explained			0
' the box [ decision ] is there to be used if i need it			0
' if my quality of life remains as it is now [ after @entity21 ] , then why would i hasten my death ? ' yesterday , appearing on @entity247 , she explained she had the option to resume treatment if her health improves			1
' it 's there on the table if i want it , ' she said			0
@entity0 also admitted today there were times when she lay awake wondering about the future			0
speaking about her new book , there 's something i 've been dying to tell you , she said : ' the book is for everyone - every single day people are going through this			0
' as my oncologist says , the smallest cancer cell can outwit the brightest oncologist			2
' in the piece she wrote for @entity23 last month , she described the devastating moment she was diagnosed			2
' the pleasant gentleman in front of me visibly crumpled			0
he stared at his computer then seemed to pull himself up and looked me straight in the eye			0
‘ " i am so terribly sorry , i thought you had already been informed of your position			0
you have cancer of the colon , and lesions on your lungs and your liver "			1
' ' i felt nothing except disbelief			0
' the actress said she had been ill the @entity21 before and ended up in @entity287			1
' i had been having really bad indigestion and then diarrhoea quite badly , and i was short of breath			0
' we finally saw a doctor who said that it was probably nothing and to take @entity294 for a couple of weeks			0
i did , and everything seemed to clear up			0
' months later , she was told there was a problem with a shadow on her liver - and see a colon specialist urgently			1
she wrote : ' the day finally came and those unforgettable words resounded round the surgeon ’s office – " now about your cancer @entity309 " , and , well , you know the rest by now			2
' the actress said recently : ' as my oncologist says , the smallest cancer cell can outwit the brightest oncologist '			1
