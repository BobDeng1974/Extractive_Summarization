@entity1 assistant @entity0 has defended @entity2 against @entity4 claims he has the ‘ intellectual properties of a tub of @entity7 ’			1
@entity2 was subjected to a bitter personal attack by 36 - cap lock and outspoken columnist @entity9 , who accused the @entity11 of ‘ shameful nepotism ’ by selecting 10 @entity1 players for the final test on the 2013 @entity16 tour			1
@entity9 added that @entity2 was focused on improving his contract negotiations with the @entity18 at the time , prompting @entity0 to label the verbal barbs as ‘ disappointing ’ and ‘ unfair ’			1
@entity2 prepares his @entity1 team for saturday 's @entity22 clash against @entity23 @entity1 coach @entity2 was subjected to a personal attack by former @entity23 player @entity9 how @entity1 and @entity23 will line up for the @entity22 match on saturday ‘ you have to experience the @entity16 to understand the @entity16 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i ’m not too sure if @entity9 was a @entity27			2
‘ the wonderful thing about rugby is everyone has their opinion about how the game should be played and there are personalities within the game			0
‘ when it becomes personal it is disappointing			2
the game is bigger than that			0
for someone to have an individual criticism and a personal snipe at someone who has won a @entity16 series , been involved in @entity22 @entity45 and championships , is disappointing			0
we do n’t need comments like that			0
it is a personal attack and totally unfair			1
’ @entity9 faced @entity1 four times for @entity23 in the 1990s and was involved in a famous bust - up in 1992 with @entity52 , who knocked the forward off his feet with a right hook			1
‘ @entity9 was a very capable player and was n’t someone to wind up the opposition , ’ recalled @entity52			2
‘ we got on very well off the field , but he has always liked a controversial comment as a pundit			0
’ since @entity9 played his final test in 1996 , @entity1 have managed just two wins over the @entity63 in @entity64			1
@entity2 was accused of having the ' intellectual properties of a tub of flora ' by @entity9 @entity1 assistant @entity0 leapt to the defence of @entity2 , labelling the barbs ' disappointing ' and ' unfair ' @entity2 has endured a prickly relationship with the @entity4 media — being compared to a ‘ menopausal warthog ’ in 2010 — and is hoping to silence his critics in saturday ’s @entity61 at the @entity74			1
the 51 - year - old , who coached @entity23 between 1998 and 2001 , has refused to engage in a war of words this week and has instead praised @entity79 ’s team , laying the pressure on their doorstep			2
he has bypassed the ‘ challenge ’ of playing under a closed roof , with @entity0 confirming on thursday that @entity1 will break with tradition and keep it open			1
the decision has avoided the sideshow that preceded @entity1 ’s opening fixture against @entity89 , whose defeat in @entity92 last week has been studied by the @entity94 coaches			2
@entity2 was also accused of ‘ shameful nepotism ’ by selecting 10 @entity1 players for the final @entity97 , 2013 @entity0 sais @entity1 will be looking to dominate possession and territory against @entity23 ‘ watching @entity23 against @entity89 was similar to our game at @entity101 last year , ’ revealed @entity0			1
‘ the things we need to dominate are territory and possession			0
that ’s key against @entity23 and they will be looking at those stats as well			2
‘ if you ’ve got possession , then you do n’t have to fight the aerial battle and the astute tactical kicking by @entity110 and @entity111			0
over the last four or five years the aerial battle has been a significant technical part of the game			0
it ’s about winning the sky and we ’re happy with where we ’re at in terms of that battle			0
’ @entity111 ’s kicking game was one of @entity23 ’s most potent weapons in @entity92 but the @entity123 has since been struggling with a hamstring injury			2
he has been named in @entity23 ’s starting xv and @entity1 will be hoping the 29 - year - old is a yard off the pace following his setback			1
@entity9 represented @entity23 36 times during his career and is now an outspoken columnist he will be joined in the line - up by @entity133 8 @entity134 , with the @entity135 completing a remarkable return to fitness after breaking three vertebrae in his back only last month			1
@entity134 completes a powerful back row alongside @entity141 and @entity142 , who developed a close relationship with fellow farmer and @entity1 flanker @entity145 on the 2013 @entity16 tour , which drew criticism from @entity9			1
@entity145 — a strong campaigner against falling butter and milk prices — knows he will have to be at his chop - tackling best against the 28 - year - old flanker			0
‘ @entity142 ’s not easy to stop and it ’s about slowing him down before he gets going , ’ said @entity145			0
‘ we got on quite well on the @entity16 tour and we ’d always chat about farming with @entity154 and @entity155			0
@entity142 ’s sponsored by @entity156 and it ’s only recently that i ’ve been sponsored by @entity157			0
‘ that ’s something we can chat about after the game , but we ’ll be giving blood , sweat and tears come the match			0
