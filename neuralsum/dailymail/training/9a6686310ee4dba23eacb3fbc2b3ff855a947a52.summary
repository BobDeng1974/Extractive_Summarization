the @entity0 's newest submarine - a miniature sub which can launch underwater that @entity4 would be proud of , has been spotted moored off of @entity5			1
the submarine is intended to launch underwater in order to carry commandos to their destinations covertly so they can perform attacks or infiltration near the water			1
attached to a large nuclear sub , the mini pod can carry up to around eight elite commandos in heavy assault gear and is designed to be as stealthy as possible			1
the miniature submarine atop the @entity18 , as manufacturers look on at its installation the pod can be seen attached to the topside of the nuclear submarine , the @entity18 , currently off the coast of @entity5			1
in a covert attack , the secret submarine pod will detach from the @entity18 and head to its destination , absorbing sonar on the way to evade detection			0
the pod will be in use by @entity34 commandos in their covert operations , and the miniature submarine will likely make their activities hard to predict or anticipate			0
@entity18 , one of @entity0 's new nuclear powered submarines , lays at dock in @entity5 on its maiden call the mini-sub opening its deployment hatch , where the commandos will leave from during their covert operations before it was mounted to the top of the @entity18 , the miniature submarine had to be airlifted by helicopter to seas near its destination , before being picked up later			2
now the submarine will move closer to the destination , and plans for deployment and support for the commandos will be more readily available			0
the miniature submarine , codenamed ' @entity57 ' , has been tested since it was installed in 2012 , but this is the first time it will reach active service			0
the miniature covert submarine is designed to be as stealthy as possible , and even comes with the ability to absorb sonar to avoid detection the @entity18 is the largest attack submarine the @entity0 has at its disposal , and is the lead ship of its class			2
thanks to air recycling it could theoretically circumnavigate the planet without having to resurface , and its nuclear power system means it will never have to refuel again during its 25 - year - service			0
however , its limit is that it is only able to carry three months worth of food for the 98 crew needed to man it			0
the miniature submarine 's main duties are for counter intelligence , as it allows for incredibly covert ops from discreet locations , and will now be able to deploy while hidden underwater , rather than having to travel by helicopter , which runs the risk of revealing its position .			1

attached to the @entity18 , the mini pod can carry up eight commandos
designed to be as stealthy for covert ops , like counter intelligence
can launch underwater to carry commandos to their destinations covertly
currently the mini sub is attached to the @entity18 , docked in @entity5
