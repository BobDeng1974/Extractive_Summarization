by @entity0 these photographs may appear to show a magnificent display by the world - renowned @entity3 – but in reality they reveal remote control replicas which have been made by a father and son ‘ stunt pilot ’ duo			1
@entity11 , 52 , and son @entity12 , 25 , have wowed audiences around the world with their quarter - scale aircrafts which cost £ 10,000 to make and are powered by a small jet engine			1

he said : ‘ i started building model aircrafts when i was around six - years - old but it was all very different then			0
‘ you had one control and were expected to do all the flying with that			0
‘ on the @entity17 - which are flown by the @entity3 - we have 18 different controls on a number of channels so there can be a lot to take in			2
‘ people are always really impressed and sometimes ca n't even tell the difference from the real thing			0
‘ at one airshow the @entity3 could n't fly because of the weather so most of their crowd came by to watch us			0
the @entity3 replicas are identical to the real planes and have been flown at air shows around the world			1
mr @entity11 , from @entity23 , @entity24 , said the orginial @entity3 daredevils have even been mesmerised by the replica models the real deal : the father and son modelled their remote control planes on the real @entity3 , pictured here returning to their base at @entity64 , @entity65 in august 2011 @entity11 and his son @entity12 spent approximately one year building the remote control replica @entity26 22s , which are the exact planes flown by the @entity3 @entity11 said : ' at one airshow the @entity3 could n't fly because of the weather so most of their crowd came by to watch us			1
it was quite incredible - after the show we noticed that some of the actual pilots had come by to watch the show ' ‘ it was quite incredible - after the show we noticed that some of the actual pilots had come by to watch the show			0
‘ our popularity has grown incredibly since we started and we now get invitations to fly from around the world			0

’ he added : ‘ people love the @entity3 , they 're a @entity86 institution and people from all over the world want to see them - and if they ca n't get the real thing that 's where we step in			2
’ despite being regarded as one of the best radio controlled formation flying teams in the world @entity95 and @entity12 , pictured building one of the planes , only practice when flying at shows the father and son have become well - known for their miniature @entity3 planes which have a wing span of 100 inches and weigh around 25kg the remote control aeroplanes are flown from the safety of the ground			1
their popularity as quickly helped @entity11 and @entity106 become one of the best radio controlled formation flying teams in the world the @entity3 replicas are incredibly life - like and even have a little dummy sitting in the cockpit acting as the pilot			2
