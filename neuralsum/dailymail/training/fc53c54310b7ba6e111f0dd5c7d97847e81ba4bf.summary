by @entity0 it ’s the group from hell , right ? we ’ve got no chance			0
even that gentleman from the @entity6 reckoned so			0
@entity8 a finger across his throat when the draw was made			0
we ’ll be home before the business end of @entity13 begins			0
anyone for tennis ? so let us start with that gloomy grab - bag of presumption			0
@entity18 do not have to steer a path through what the locals would call the inferno in @entity23 this month			1
even of late , they have had it worse , and qualified			2
in 2002 in @entity29 , for instance , @entity27 ’s squad were up against @entity30 , who they had not defeated since 1968 , @entity33 and @entity32			0
even in the last campaign , the 2012 @entity34 , @entity18 faced @entity36 , @entity30 again and the hosts , @entity38			1
@entity52 – @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 – sounds harder than it is , and not least because the matches come in precisely the right order			1
@entity18 could have had it better when the names came out of the hat , obviously , but they could not have improved on the schedule , a visit to tropical @entity63 aside			1
it is , frankly pointless , however , complaining that a @entity23 @entity48 is taking the team beyond its comfort zone into the @entity68 rainforest , as that is what a @entity48 outside the @entity69 will always do			1
there will be heat , humidity , relatively remote locations and steps into the unknown and the sooner @entity77 football realises that and stops whinging about the weather every time a major tournament arrives , the more seriously this country will be taken as a competing nation			0
not every competition can be held in @entity84			0
and we stunk that joint out , mostly , in 2006 if you remember			0
so : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 – in that order			1
got lucky there , did n’t we , whatever the @entity6 ’s resident drama queen might say			0
what if the fixtures had been reversed ? @entity55 in @entity63 first , @entity53 last			1
no fear : @entity96 and @entity18 struck lucky with their group and should reach the last eight the first game of a tournament is invariably cagey and @entity102 , @entity18 ’s manager , is not a natural risk - taker			1
yet @entity55 demand to be beaten , and beaten well , if goal difference is going to come into play as it often can in a tight group			1
@entity18 would be stepping into the unknown			1
would 1 - 0 do ? what if it was a draw ? and imagine a draw , with @entity53 to play last			1
@entity111 took @entity18 to the @entity112 by getting a result against the @entity114 , but his requirement was a draw in @entity117			1
the fact is , @entity18 are playing @entity53 at precisely the right time , first – and in a location that offers equal disadvantage to all			1
when @entity128 signed for @entity129 in 1995 , sir @entity127 , then in his capacity as chairman of @entity126 , wondered how the expensive new arrival would fare when the cold weather kicked in			0
@entity132 : @entity133 's @entity53 have n't won for seven games and on wednesday drew with @entity135 june 14 - @entity53 , @entity136 ( 11pm ) june 19 - @entity54 , @entity137 ( 8pm ) june 24 - @entity55 , @entity138 ( 5pm ) * all times @entity139 this appeared to be a world view based on all of @entity53 being the temperature of @entity143 in july			1
@entity128 was arriving from @entity144 , where a real fur coat is still a fashion accessory at the opera			0
it is fair to presume that nobody wears fur to the famous @entity152 opera house in @entity63			1
@entity153 , where @entity114 champions @entity154 are based , hosted the @entity155 in 2006			1
@entity68 @entity23 is just as inhospitable to most @entity114 players as it will be to their @entity77 opponents			1
@entity158 , @entity53 ’s coach , has been working in sweat boxes and attempting scientific exercises in energy conservation just the same			2
and @entity53 are , by their footballing nature , cautious to begin with			2
it is another reason to play them first			0
since the war , @entity53 have been involved in 14 opening fixtures at @entity168 and for a supposed footballing powerhouse , have won just half of them			1
no great shakes : @entity173 reject @entity174 ( left ) is @entity54 's captain - which says it all they have never won any opening group game by more than two goals in that time – not even against @entity181 in 1974 – and three of those seven wins have been achieved by a single goal margin			1
faced with a dangerous opponent , @entity53 most often draw – against @entity84 in 1962 , @entity186 in 1982 , @entity187 in 1986 , @entity188 in 1998 and @entity189 in 2010			2
@entity53 versus @entity18 in @entity63 is the shortest price of any group game at the tournament to be a 0 - 0 draw : 7 - 1			1
backing the stalemate is usually a mug ’s game because a goal at either end kills the bet , but enough fancy it here for the bookmakers to lay at unappealing odds			0
why ? @entity53 are outs of sorts , have n’t won since september and drew 1 - 1 with @entity135 in a friendly last week			1
they are perceived as cautious starters , @entity102 is perceived as cautious			2
conditions in @entity63 will be oppressive			2
easily beatable : @entity55 keeper @entity209 might have a lot of work to do during the tournament in 13 @entity18 have only lost two opening games			1
both times they made the quarter - finals the pace of the game will be slow , wary , exhausting			0
if it gets to 70 minutes without a goal all instincts will be to settle			0
and , having not lost to the most difficult group opponents , @entity18 would be on their way			2
@entity54 are no great shakes			2
they have a great player , in @entity226 and one not far behind in @entity228 , but five teams from nine in @entity229 qualified for this tournament and @entity54 were last through the door via a play - off with @entity233			2
nobody knows what shape @entity226 will be in come june 19 in @entity137 , either			0
in other words they are beatable			0
a @entity229 team on its own continent will always be a test but while the ordinary @entity174 , formerly of @entity173 , captains @entity54 , this not a match to be feared , but taken on			2
difficult start : @entity27 's @entity18 had a tougher group in 2002 than the current team have leaving @entity55 , by which time @entity18 ’s destiny may be known			1
if @entity18 need to win , they should win			2
if they need to win by a margin , that should not be beyond possibility either			0
qualify and one from @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity29 and @entity252 await in the next round			0
@entity254 tipped @entity18 to reach the last eight , at least , and he is no poor judge			1
@entity18 should have every reason to anticipate and experience the colour and warmth of football ’s spiritual homecoming without fear or despair			2
nobody is predicting triumph – but disaster should be equally foreign to this campaign			0
we can have a go			0
we should have a go			0
what would be the point otherwise ?			0

@entity18 have had worse qualifying groups in previous tournaments
@entity53 will be as *unused* to the @entity63 *climate* as @entity102 's men
@entity18 have @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 in the right order
the @entity114 have won just half of their 14 @entity48 opening matches
@entity254 picked @entity18 to get to the last eight
