' it was the first time i 'd ever met @entity9			2
so , i went over and said ' @entity9 can i have a photograph '			2

so we had a little bit of a chit chat			0
she said ' what do you do ? ' and i said ' i 'm a local party activist '			0
' she said ' oh you 're far too pretty to be in politics you should be in @entity122			2
i actually took it as a compliment			0
' i actually took it as a compliment , i was n't insulted by it			0
i thought thank you that 's actually really nice			0
of course a women is n't going to be insulted by a compliment			0
' but what does upset me is that she is saying i 'm lying			0
i just think , if you did n't remember saying that to me then just say , ' i do n't remember saying that but i 'm glad that she 's proved me wrong '			2
' but to say that i 'm lying , i just think , no , that 's not very nice			0
' ' i 'm sure she just thought , young , pretty party activist , give her a little compliment and that will be the end of it			2
i 'm sure she never thought at the time that some years later it would come back and haunt her			0

that 's what has upset me			0
there was no reason for me to lie about that			0
' i think @entity9 should apologise , because she is absolutely wrong and she 's really upset me			1
i do n't want it being a massive public spat – i 'm telling the truth			0
calling me a liar is absolutely wrong and the more she calls me a liar the more i wo n't let this drop			0
' but if she turned up next week in her pink bus and said ' @entity7 , i 'm sorry let 's have a talk ' i 'd definitely welcome it			1
' if she wants to apologise and come to @entity24 i 'd welcome her with open arms			0
