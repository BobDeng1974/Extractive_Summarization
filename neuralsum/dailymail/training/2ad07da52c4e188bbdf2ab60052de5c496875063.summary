a former cancer patient who wrote to @entity1 and thanked him for helping to save her life is claiming £ 60,000 damages for what she claims was a series of sexual assaults			1
her claim is one of many being laid against @entity1 ’s estate which a @entity11 investigation has found to be questionable			1
last month this newspaper revealed that @entity13 were investigating allegations that @entity1 ’s great - niece , @entity15 , is fraudulently claiming compensation for supposed assaults by @entity1 when she was 12 and 15			1
she is now claiming £ 60,000 worth of damages for what she claims was a series of sex assaults the @entity11 revealed last month there have been a series of questionable claims against the @entity30 estate the inquiry was triggered by statements from close family members , including her daughter , @entity34			1
a police spokesman said yesterday that the investigation is continuing			0
legal restrictions mean those who say they were victims of sexual crimes must remain anonymous , unless they waive their anonymity , as ms @entity15 did			0
this means we can not name the former cancer patient			1
but of the 211 claims for payments from @entity1 ’s estate which have been lodged under a compensation scheme approved in february by the @entity52 , hers is one of the strangest			1
@entity1 's great - niece @entity15 , who is alleged to have fraudulently claimed compensation for supposed assaults before @entity1 ’s death in 2011 , she wrote warmly of their long bedside conversations when she was at death ’s door , saying how grateful she was that he treated her as someone with hopes , dreams and a future			1
after his death , she ran short of money , and wrote a begging letter to the @entity67 , the charity to which he left almost all his £ 4.7 million fortune			0
it responded with a donation of £ 2,500			0
‘ joyful news that @entity1 ’s trust is going to help my determined mission to stay alive , ’ she said in a thank - you note			1
but now the same woman is claiming @entity77 sexually assaulted her numerous times in @entity80 dressing rooms and at his @entity82 flat			2
those who saw the pair together say they are astonished			0
‘ we spent an afternoon together , and she spoke of @entity1 with deep affection			1
i simply ca n’t believe he had been sexually assaulting her , ’ said @entity86 , a music promoter who was @entity1 ’s friend			2
the woman ’s mother initially promised to relay a statement from her to @entity11 , but later said this would not be possible			0
another questionable claim is from a man who says he visited @entity30 ’s @entity99 penthouse flat in december 1975 when he was a paperboy , to collect his @entity102 bonus			2
@entity1 did not move into this flat until 1986			2
this week , the @entity104 will hear a submission from the @entity67 that the compensation scheme be quashed			0
its solicitor , @entity107 , said : ‘ the scheme seems designed to give money to anyone who claims they were abused , with minimal due diligence			0
we hope the @entity104 will address these concerns			0
‘ otherwise , no one ’s estate will be safe when they die			0

claim one of many being laid against @entity1 's estate found to be questionable
