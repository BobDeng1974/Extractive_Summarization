as a fraudster is indicted for a $ 1.3million hoax counterfeiting rare wines and selling the bottles , attention has fallen to the consumer - trusted wine experts who were so easily fooled			2
the world 's most respected taste buds bought , sold and wrote about @entity11 's wine collection , many of which turned out to be re-marked fakes from @entity15			1
now , as the 35 - year - old faces jail time of up to 100 years , many are speculating as to how he managed to get away with it			1
mr believable : @entity11 conned savvy , competitive rare - wine collectors , with the biggest hoax in history taking place right under their noses an article in the latest @entity27 points out how many of mr @entity11 's apparently sought - after wines , of which he sold more than $ 35 million worth in 2006 alone , are alleged to be counterfeits - potentially damaging the prestigious world of wine experts and their often snobby credibility			1
when the @entity37 arrested mr @entity11 on march 8 , his @entity36 home contained explicit evidence of the scam , which alluded the circle of wine experts and enthusiasts who were his trusted confidants			1
thousands of photocopied wine labels for top vintages , including 1950 @entity47 and 1947 @entity48 , @entity49 , and @entity50 were found next to hundreds of old and new corks , and an automatic device for inserting them			2
most notably , there were bottles of cheap @entity15 wine labelled with names of the vintage @entity61 wines they allegedly intended to impersonate , and there were other bottles soaking in the kitchen sink , their labels about to be removed			2
detailed instructions for fabricating labels for 1962 @entity67 were found as well as sealing wax and rubber stamps with vintages and chateaux names , such as 1899 and 1900 @entity72			2
fake labels : when the @entity37 arrested mr @entity11 , his @entity36 home contained explicit evidence of the scam , including thousands of photocopied wine labels international wine auctioneers , such as @entity78 , expert @entity79 critics , like @entity81 , wine shop owner @entity82 , as well as the wider wine industry , were all left to question how solid their old - wine knowledge really is			1
along with mr @entity82 , mr @entity78 had also published countless tasting notes based on mr @entity11 's wines , and mr @entity81 , too , had written notes for some of the rarest wines from mr @entity11 's apparent fake bottles			1
the inability to prove hard facts within the rare wine industry helped mr @entity11 carry out the biggest hoax in history right under their noses			1
before @entity99 , there are few records showing how many bottles of a particular wine were produced , in what formats , and in what packaging , with variation in bottles being common			0
also , the older and rarer the wine , the fewer people who have actually tasted it - and even skilled tasters can disagree about flavor			0
explicit evidence : bottles of cheap @entity15 wine were found labelled with names of the vintage @entity61 wines , along with their corks even if a wine tastes odd , it is usually cited as being ' inconsistent , ' rather than declared a fake by auctioneers who do not want to risk losing consignments by investigating obscure bottles , or by winemakers who are uneasy about discussing counterfeiting , for fear of tainting their vineyard			0
in the rare - wine world , murkiness has the ability to turn doubt into mystique and many wealthy collectors only want to drink famous , expensive labels - not necessarily ask questions			0
it was n't until @entity140 , the maker of a renowned collectible @entity79 , launched his own investigation after mr @entity143 tried selling fake versions of his wine , that the hoax started to unravel			0
@entity67 wines only started making its @entity148 in the @entity150 , and it was an auction of @entity153 - consigned vintages from 1959 and 1945 that alerted mr @entity140 to the irrefutable fakes			0
the rare wine collecting industry is built upon scarcity , and the credibility and expertise of preeminent critics			0
fraud : detailed instructions for fabricating labels were found as well as sealing wax and rubber stamps with vintages and chateaux names in reality , mr @entity11 's case may have proven the murky world of prestigious and rare wines is instead built on illusions , snobbery and ego			1
with so many experts duped , one could argue that expensive , vintage bottles may have a taste nearer to that of cheaper wines than the world has long lead to be believed			0
mr @entity82 told the @entity182 : ' it ’s so damaging to the magic of wine			0

@entity11 was indicted in @entity186 last week
he faces four counts of mail and wire fraud , and jail time of up to 100 years
