five months after the @entity13 crew returned to @entity16 , the @entity132 issued a postage stamp depicting @entity135			2
but as well known as the photograph became , the details regarding its creation were limited for four decades to the astronauts ' anecdotes			0
then @entity142 , the project lead with the @entity144 at @entity23 's @entity145 in @entity146 , began reassembling the @entity13 crew 's experience using data returned by @entity22			0
