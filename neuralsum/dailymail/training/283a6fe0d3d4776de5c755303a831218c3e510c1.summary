by @entity0 published : 11:30 est , 8 june 2013 updated : 12:00 est , 8 june 2013 it is a prank that goes against all conventional wisdom for kitchen safety			2
in a video posted to @entity7 , a man tells the camera : ' @entity9 lost a bet so he 's got to stick a knife in the toaster '			1
the footage unfolds with @entity9 holding a knife and looking quite hesitant about his task			2
at one point another pal tells him : ' the handle 's plastic on that one , you 're not going to feel anything ' , to try to convince him to go ahead			2
amid plenty of swear words , the group try counting to three to get the dare going			1
@entity9 even gestures to the camera , asking : ' why is he filming because obviously something 's going to go wrong '			0
after three attempts at a countdown and a few more expletives , @entity9 sticks the knife in			0
in a flash of white light , the group appear to be thrown back by the force of the blast			1
but commenters on @entity7 questioned whether the explosion was real or staged			1
@entity9 is seen and heard being egged on by his friends to carry out the dare some claimed the video was edited so the sound did n't match the blast , while others said the knife did not touch the toaster			1
but another backed up the makers of the video , writing : ' the initial contact with the knife and the toaster creates a flash of light before a process called thermal conduction takes place			0
' this is why it seems like the knife never touched the toaster			0
' whether the toaster was plugged in or not , sticking the knife in is certainly not something to try at home			0
it took a few attempts at psyching himself up before @entity9 finally took the plunge the mangled remains of the toaster are seen on the worktop with little else looking damaged			0
