will @entity0 qualify for the knockout stages ? will @entity0 qualify for the knockout stages ? now share your opinion @entity5 recorded an astonishing 93.2 per cent passing accuracy during their 2 - 1 win against @entity0 on saturday night which is the highest ever recorded in a single @entity11 game since 1966			1
with players like @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 patrolling midfield in the heat of @entity19 , it 's no wonder @entity5 recorded such a high figure			1
@entity21 maestro @entity14 showed his class once again , making 108 passes and only misplacing five of those while his partner @entity16 made 99 of his 105			2
@entity0 's midfield looked overrun at times as @entity40 and @entity33 battled to interrupt the @entity5 's flowing football			2
@entity5 's opening goal may have indirectly arrived from a corner , but even that involved several intricate passes and a sumptuous dummy from @entity14 before @entity28 rifled home in the 35th minute			0
everywhere : @entity14 ( left ) made 103 of his 108 attempted passes during @entity5 's win against @entity0 overall @entity51 's side made 561 passes from 602 attempts as they quite literally passed @entity0 's spirited performance into the ground			1
it 's no wonder that it was the @entity0 players slumping to the ground , complaining of cramp and picking up slight injuries towards the end of the game as chasing shadows in the @entity65 evening heat started to catch up with @entity67 players			0
as the @entity70 players tired , @entity5 's substitutions came on and fitted seemlessly into their team 's passing game			0
@entity73 midfielder @entity15 spent an hour finding space and nipping between the lines while recording 93.90 per cent before his replacement @entity77 came on and failed to misplace a pass for the final 30 minutes			0
on his own : @entity80 struggled to make an impact on the @entity83 clash , starting from the left of midfield hit and miss : @entity16 's touch map shows the @entity21 was more involved than @entity33 ( right ) 26 - second half substitute @entity77 replaced @entity15 in the 57th minute and completed every one of his 26 passes @entity0 tired and began to lose possession far too easily in the closing stages , @entity80 shooting wildly and @entity91 hitting crosses into the crowd			1
the @entity21 on the other hand looked so assured with the ball at their feet that after @entity98 headed past @entity99 in the 48th minute , only one team looked as though they could pick up all three points			0
for all the energy that the @entity0 youngster possess , the likes of @entity91 and @entity40 will have learned a huge lesson in the importance of being patient on the ball thanks to the @entity5			0
second fiddle : @entity33 ( right ) had a pass accuracy of 92.5 per cent , but only completed 62 passes learning curve : @entity40 ( left ) had a good game but could n't match the @entity21 's ball possession			1

@entity5 recorded 93.2 per cent passing accuracy during @entity11 win against @entity0
the @entity5 completed 561 of their 602 passes
@entity14 made 108 passes , the most so far in a @entity121 match
@entity33 made 62 accurate passes as @entity0 lost in @entity38
