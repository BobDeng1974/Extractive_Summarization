@entity0 was sat in the press room at @entity2 when he began answering a question about @entity4			1
by the time he had finished , the subject of his response had kicked off their @entity9 match in @entity10 and were 1 - 0 up inside 90 seconds thanks to @entity12			0
@entity0 , unwittingly , had spoken of holding no fear ahead of tuesday ’s trip to the @entity15			1
the @entity27 champions are , at present , in frightening form			1
in their last six matches they have plundered 24 goals , @entity32 and @entity19 among those vanquished in that period			1
indeed , you must trawl back to may for the last time they failed to score in a league fixture			0
free - scoring , however , @entity19 are not – freefall would be a more apt description of late			1
they have drawn blanks in three of their last four , and even then the 2 - 1 @entity43 victory over @entity44 arrived courtesy of two goals in the final four minutes			1
@entity0 insists that he welcomes the trip to the @entity49 capital , ‘ they ’re all great games , are n’t they ? ’ , was his reply when asked about the prospect of his side taking on @entity4 amid their current struggle			1
@entity56 fires the opening goal past @entity58 as @entity59 beat @entity19 1 - 0 on saturday @entity19 captain @entity60 ( left ) applauds the fans as @entity59 players celebrate their victory his tone , however , betrayed his trepidation , for he knows what lies in wait			2
after all , it was @entity19 just last season who terrified anyone who dared to venture to @entity72			2
that is why they are here in the @entity76			2
but that team – inspired by @entity78 and @entity79 and a carefree @entity80 – does not exist any more , or certainly not right now			0
at @entity59 on saturday during their 1 - 0 defeat , they were void of energy and invention , a team low on confidence and seemingly with no answers as to how to halt their slide			0
meanwhile , in @entity49 , @entity12 was scoring his 22nd goal of the campaign – that is three more than the entire @entity19 squad combined			2
it was he who broke the deadlock in quite brilliant fashion at @entity72 a fortnight ago when he strode on to @entity98 ’s exquisite through - chip and hooked into the top corner			0
@entity99 added two more with alarming ease			0
@entity19 players show their dejection during the 3 - 0 defeat by @entity4 at @entity72 a fortnight ago @entity12 celebrates in front of the home fans after opening the scoring for @entity4 at @entity72 @entity16 hails ' fantastic ' @entity12 and calls on @entity4 to maintain form at @entity10 , it was @entity12 , a @entity98 double and @entity99 on target in a comfortable 4 - 0 success – the leading men are at the top of their game			1
add to that the return of @entity18 and you would perhaps forgive @entity0 for adopting a ‘ damage limitation ’ approach when the action gets underway			2
there is also , of course , the not - so - trivial matter of revenge			0
it was during the last - 16 stage of 2008 - 09 that @entity19 enjoyed a 5 - 0 two - legged triumph			0
@entity12 ( right ) celebrates after scoring the opening goal in @entity4 's 4 - 0 win against @entity10 on saturday @entity60 ( left ) and @entity130 ( second left ) celebrate during @entity19 's 4 - 0 win against @entity4 in 2009 @entity60 smashed a double in the 4 - 0 rout on home soil , but it was the captain who sounded a note of caution ahead of last month ’s 3 - 0 defeat			1
‘ we are playing against the best side in @entity141 and if we have two or three passengers it can become embarrassing against sides like this who are deadly , ’ he said			0
@entity60 was wise before the event and so it transpired that @entity4 were easy victors			0
@entity19 fans have every reason to fear a repeat on tuesday night .			1

@entity4 host @entity19 in the @entity76 on tuesday night
@entity0 spoke of holding no fear ahead of trip to the @entity15
but the @entity27 champions are currently in frightening form
@entity19 have drawn blanks in three of their last four matches
