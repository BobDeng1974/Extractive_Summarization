a study found there is no link between escess salt consumption in over- 70s and mortality eating too much salt is not linked to the risk of death or heart disease among older adults – contrary to current medical advice , say researchers			1
a new @entity14 study found in older pensioners aged over 70 there was no association between levels of salt intake and mortality , or chances of developing heart disease and heart failure			1
however , the research was based on the self - reported salt intake of those taking part which may affect the findings			1
excess salt is a major contributor to high blood pressure , leading to heart disease and stroke			1
although @entity36 salt intake has fallen in recent years , the average daily intake of 8.6g remains above the target level of 6g			2
new targets commit the @entity36 to working towards a maximum 5g a day by 2025			0
the study of 2,642 adults who ranged in age from 71 to 80 looked at dietary sodium consumption			0
@entity44 contains 40 per cent sodium , so recommended levels of sodium are lower than the salt equivalent			0
dr @entity49 , of @entity50 , @entity51 , and colleagues looked at the link between sodium intake and death rates , and the risk of cardiovascular disease ( @entity58 ) and heart failure			0
they analysed follow - up data on the adults taking part , whose dietary sodium intake was assessed at the start of the study with a questionnaire			1
after 10 years , 881 of the participants had died , 572 had developed @entity58 and 398 had developed heart failure			0
sodium intake was not associated with death or new development of heart problems , according to study results			0
ten - year death rates were 33.8 percent , 30.7 percent and 35.2 percent among participants consuming less than 1,500 mg / d , 1,500 to 2,300 mg / d , and greater than 2,300 mg / d of sodium , respectively			0
in the @entity14 , the recommended sodium intake for adults over 50 is less than 1,500 mg / day or 3.75g of salt			2
the researchers said more testing was needed before older people were exhorted to restrict their sodium intake to below 2,300 mg / day – the equivalent of around 6g of salt - recommended for the general adult population			2
‘ our data emphasise the need for stronger evidence , preferably from rigorous controlled trials testing additional thresholds for sodium intake ’ said the study			0
the study was criticised by some doctors and academics for the weak method of assessing salt intake which meant it was in danger of misleading the public , it was claimed			2
excess salt is a major contributor to high blood pressure , leading to heart disease and stroke dr @entity109 , reader in @entity110 and consultant cardiologist , @entity112 , said salt intake was based on a single questionnaire and the findings were dependent on consumption remaining unchanged over 10 years			1
he said ‘ at the end of the day , most people do n’t need a doctor or a scientist to tell them that an apple is almost certainly healthier than a packet of crisps			0
’ prof @entity124 , associate medical director at the @entity125 , said ‘ the study showed that risk of cardiovascular disease was not significantly different for people over 70 years old with a similar blood pressure but differing levels of salt intake			1
‘ however , blood pressure can be influenced by a number of factors and the finding that people with a similar blood pressure had a similar risk of cardiovascular disease is not surprising			2
‘ more research is therefore needed before recommending further restrictions on salt intake for older adults			1
‘ this study does not contradict current dietary guidelines that people should consume less than 6g of salt per day			0
‘ there is global agreement that lowering the amount of salt you consume will lower blood pressure which can significantly reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease			1
