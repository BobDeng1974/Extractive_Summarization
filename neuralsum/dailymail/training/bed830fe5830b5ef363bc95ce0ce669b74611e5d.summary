honey , cheese , eggs , organic meat and produce , basmati rice , even fish and chips are not necessarily what they seem			2
just before christmas one @entity16 firm was fined more than £ 20,000 for passing off a cheap pesto sauce as something far more gourmet			1
the naked truth : @entity21 passed off cheaper pesto sauces as something far more gourmet @entity21 claimed its pesto was made with extra virgin olive oil and @entity28 cheese , when in fact it was sunflower oil and a cheaper @entity31 cheese			1

2007 : steaks sold by the @entity113 and restaurants in @entity116 pubs contained @entity47 genes			1
this is not illegal , but diners may be short - changed as @entity47 is known to be tougher than @entity16 beef			1
the steaks were imported from @entity55			2
2007 : @entity123 & @entity124 group , which owns @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity122 and @entity127			0

2003 : thousands of tonnes of ' plastic chicken ' imported into @entity16 , according to @entity171			2
this is chicken pumped up with water , chemicals and flavourings			0
fined : pies from @entity178 ’s range ( library image ) were falsely labelled ' suitable for vegetarians ' 2003 : 46 per cent of basmati rice samples were bulked up with cheaper varieties , according to @entity171			2

caught : even upmarket @entity78 in @entity232 has been found selling farmed salmon as wild in the past ' things like extending – bulking up – meat products with other species is common in catering			1
we have known this with certain types of take - away food and fish , for example			0
' where there is a price differential there is always a temptation for a more unscrupulous manufacturer to make a switch and try and get away with it			0
' mr @entity223 said : ' wherever there is a few pounds to be made someone will try to exploit it			0
' in times of recession , when people are looking for a bargain and going to different places , that is where you start to find more fraud introduced to food			0
' policing of food companies and restaurants is the job of trading standards officers , however spending on these services and number of people on the ground has been cut sharply in the last two years			0
mr @entity223 said : ' with the limited resources that trading standards have , which is diminishing year on year , they are less able to carry out the more routine sampling we would normally do			0
