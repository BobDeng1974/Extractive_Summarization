by @entity0 when two glamorous women departed @entity3 in @entity4 on 28 april 1870 after a show , passers - by were startled to see them being arrested by police officers			1
the women , who had been flirting openly with male members of the audience all evening , had also , unbeknown to them , been the object of the officers ' attention throughout the play			2
producing a warrant card and apprehending the ladies , the arresting officer said : ' i 'm a police officer from @entity18 , and i have every reason to believe that you are men in female attire and you will have to come to @entity18 with me now			2
' the officer was correct in his belief			2
the ' women ' were @entity25 and @entity26 , a pair of middle - class gentlemen with a predilection for cross-dressing - and their subsequent court trial for being transvestites scandalised @entity33			1
and now their extraordinary tale has been chronicled in a new book by writer @entity36 , author of @entity37 , entitled @entity38 and published by @entity39 on 7 february			1
@entity26 , left , and @entity25 , right , the two @entity41 men who were arrested and charged with having sex with each other and also of several acts of conspiracy @entity46 , left , as @entity26 , and as himself , right @entity25 and @entity26 's real names were @entity46 , 22 , and @entity46 , 21			1
and on the night in question they were charged with both having sex with each other ( homosexuality was a criminal offence until 1967 ) and also with several counts of conspiracy			1
it even emerged police had had their ' dressing - up flat ' under surveillance for a year - and that the home secretary himself was encouraging the attorney general to prosecute			2
@entity64 was the elder of the two , the youngest in a family of 12 children and the son of judge @entity69			0
his brother @entity71 had already left @entity72 and escaped to @entity73 after being arrested for homosexual offences			2
@entity46 , just 20 , was the more naturally beautiful of the pair , and very attractive in his feminine guise			1
the son of a shipping broker , @entity46 had a wonderful soprano voice and was determined to be a singer until his father pushed him into a career as a banker			1
his most famous lover was lord @entity85 , son of the @entity86 and godson of prime minister @entity88			0
@entity25 resting on the shoulder of lord @entity85 , son of the @entity86 , at one time the lover of @entity26 , sitting on floor @entity41 drawings of @entity26 , left , and @entity25 , right the day after their arrest , @entity25 and @entity26 arrived sensationally at @entity18 magistrates court where nearly 1,000 people gathered to watch them be taken inside			2
the two men spent four months in jail awaiting trial , and if convicted , their sentence would be between 10 years and life in prison			0
regardless , the pair did not flee when they were released from prison before trial , and the case arrived at @entity108 court in may 1871 for a huge state trial with the lord chief justice as judge and the prosecution led the attorney - general with the assistance of the solicitor - general			2
@entity26 and @entity25 , top right with croquet sticks , loved dressing up in resplendent women 's clothes and going out in @entity4 society in the 19th century @entity46 , left , toured as a female impersonator with his brother @entity122 before dying in @entity72 in 1903 , while @entity46 , right , went to @entity123 with his banished brother @entity71 and died in @entity125 in 1881 the trial of @entity25 , right , and @entity26 , left , was considered @entity128 's first great legal squabble with homosexuality , but was forgotten as quickly as it became a sensation but because of a very weak prosecution case - and the fact that the two men were charged with conspiracy with six others who had , between them , fled , died or did n't even know each other - the trial failed and the men were acquired			1
@entity46 's mother @entity140 had , crucially , testified to say that it was no secret his son 's nickname was @entity26 and that he enjoyed dressing as a woman - which made the case look more silly than sordid and sinister			1
@entity36 , who has written a book about the notorious @entity41 transvestites entitled @entity38 , told the @entity149 : ' the irony is that if they had just been charged with sodomy the medical evidence would have meant they would probably have been convicted , sent to prison and died there			1
' @entity46 and @entity46 , also known as @entity26 and @entity25 , arrested at the @entity154 for incitement to commit an unnatural offence , by going around @entity4 at night in women 's clothes a drawing of the two female impersonators ' dressing room @entity162 explains that the furore surrounding the trial of @entity25 and @entity26 can be put down to @entity41 society ' having one of its periodic anxiety attacks ' about homosexuality - which had recently become a term to describe an identity rather than just a fleeting behaviour - sexually transmitted disease , death and the effeminisation of a previously masculine @entity128			1
after the trial - which was considered @entity128 's first great legal squabble with homosexuality , but forgotten as quickly as it became a sensation - @entity46 went to @entity123 with his banished brother @entity71 and died in @entity125 in 1881			1
@entity46 changed his name to @entity181 and toured as a female impersonator with his brother @entity122			2
he died in @entity72 in 1903			0
@entity38 by @entity36 ( @entity39 , £ 16.99 ) is out on 7 february @entity25 and @entity26 were hard to fathom			1
they had behaved with such lewdness in their box in the stalls as to leave not the faintest shred of doubt in even the most disinterested observer that they were a pair of hardened and shameless whores			0
and yet , close up , @entity26 was revealed as a beautiful , almost aristocratic , young woman who showed flashes of an innate , and most decidedly un-whorelike , dignity and grace			0
one newspaper said later that she was ‘ charming as a star ’ , another christened her ‘ @entity203 ’			0
and despite all the opprobrium that would later be heaped upon her , despite all the mud that would be slung at her and all the mud that would stick to her , she never lost the mysterious aura of a great and stellar beauty			0
mrs @entity209 , too , was clearly a woman of some education and breeding , and was certainly very far removed from your common - or - garden whore			0
here in the saloon bar , it seemed harder to reconcile their obvious quality with the ogling , tongue - waggling , chirruping lasciviousness of the stalls			0
they spent half an hour or so in the refreshment bar			0
before they left , mrs @entity209 , unaware that she was being watched , betook herself to the @entity225 ’ retiring room and asked the attendant there to pin the lace back to the hem of her crinoline where she had trodden on it			0
at a quarter past ten , mr @entity233 had been despatched in ringing tones by @entity235 to go and call for her carriage and soon afterwards the remainder of the party made a leisurely progress to the foyer and pushed their way through the noise and confusion of an emptying theatre to the waiting conveyance			0
just as the carriage was about to depart , one of the men who had been shadowing them all that evening jumped up and swung himself in through the door			0
' i ’m a police officer from @entity18 , ’ he said , producing his warrant card , ‘ and i have every reason to believe that you are men in female attire and you will have to come to @entity18 with me now			0
' extracted from @entity38 by @entity36 ( @entity39 , £ 16.99 ) @entity162 explains that the furore surrounding the trial of @entity25 and @entity26 can be put down to @entity41 society ' having one of its periodic anxiety attacks ' about homosexuality @entity46 - pictured as @entity25 - went to @entity123 with his banished brother @entity71 and died in @entity125 in 1881 @entity64 dressed as @entity25			1

@entity46 , 22 , and @entity46 , 21 , arrested on 28 april 1870
apprehended as they were leaving @entity154 in @entity4
charged with homosexuality and ' conspiracy '
they were acquitted after the prosecution built a very weak case
new book by @entity36 , @entity25 , tells their amazing story
