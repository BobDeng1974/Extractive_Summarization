@entity1 president @entity0 refused to answer questions about the beleaguered @entity4 website as he walked to church with this family this morning			1
the @entity8 attended the 11am service at @entity11 @entity10 , an @entity13 congregation , about a block from the @entity15 , @entity7 reported			1
when a reporter asked if the troubled @entity18 website will be fixed by november 30 , @entity0 responded : ' c'mon guys , i 'm going to church '			1
family outing : the @entity8 attended mass at @entity11 in @entity24 on sunday @entity0 is not an overtly religious man			1
he and his family rarely attend church , and he almost never elaborates in public about his own relationship to his @entity31 faith			1
but far away from the public eye , his longtime advisers say , the president has carefully nurtured a sense of spirituality that has served as a grounding mechanism during turbulent times , when the obstacles to governing a deeply divided nation seem nearly insurmountable			1
every year on august 4 , the president 's birthday , @entity0 convenes a group of pastors by phone to receive their prayers for him for the year to come			1
during the most challenging of times , prayer circles are organized with prominent religious figures such as megachurch pastor @entity50 , bishop @entity51 of the @entity52 and the reverend @entity53 , a civil rights activist			0
devout : the @entity8 farewell @entity55 , center , after service at @entity11 in @entity24 on sunday and each morning for the past five years , before most of his aides even arrive at the @entity15 , @entity0 has read a devotional written for him and sent to his blackberry , weaving together biblical scripture with reflections from literary figures like @entity64 and @entity65			1
' i 've certainly seen the president 's faith grow in his time in office , ' said @entity71 , an informal spiritual adviser to @entity0 who writes the devotionals and ran @entity0 's faith - based office until earlier this year			1
' when you cultivate your faith , it grows			0
' @entity0 is particularly moved by theories that draw connections between biblical themes and the personal journeys of historical figures like @entity84 and @entity85 , @entity71 said			2
he added that the president 's spiritual strength is his belief that @entity89 will carry him through to see another day â€” even amid crises like the debt - and - spending debacle that 's ensnared @entity24 for the last month			1
' because of these grounding aspects of his life , he does n't let the day - to - day challenges really shake him , ' said @entity71 , a former associate pastor at a pentecostal church			0
spiritual guide : @entity71 is president @entity0 's ' pastor - in - chief ' the image of @entity0 as someone who draws heavily on faith to guide his daily life contrasts with his public persona			1
an intensely private person , @entity0 has shied away from all but the most general descriptions of his spiritual life			2
after all , @entity0 had to distance himself from his longtime pastor , the reverend @entity107 , when his anti-american rantings threatened @entity0 's 2008 presidential campaign			1
and persistent , false claims that @entity0 is secretly a @entity111 have followed him even into his second term			0
' sometimes i search scripture to determine how best to balance life as a president and as a husband and as a father , ' @entity0 said in february at the @entity119			2
' i often search for scripture to figure out how i can be a better man as well as a better president			0
' the best clues to which texts fortify @entity0 's spiritual consumption may come from the daily devotionals that @entity71 started sending @entity0 , then a @entity1 senator , in 2008			2
@entity71 ran religious outreach for @entity0 's presidential campaign that year , and his digital benedictions for @entity0 have been compiled in a forthcoming book , ' the president 's devotional '			1
' a snippet of scripture for me to reflect on , ' @entity0 has said			0
' and it has meant the world to me			0
' at pivotal moments in @entity0 's presidency , @entity71 sometimes selects texts that offer lessons apropos of the challenges at hand			2
before one @entity144 address , it was the words of @entity146 , in an appeal for clarity of speech : ' so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth , it shall not return to me empty , but it shall accomplish that which i purpose			0
' faithful : the @entity8 , flanked by their security detail , walk from the @entity15 to @entity11 for sunday services in @entity24 others are intended as an oasis from the worldly conflicts @entity0 has to weather on any given day			1
' we are hard pressed on every side , but not crushed			0
perplexed , but not in despair , ' reads a verse from 2 @entity166 that @entity71 sent @entity0 one november , followed with his own meditation : ' dear @entity89 , give us a resilient spirit , a spirit that returns to face this day even in the shadow of yesterday 's challenges			2
help us , today , to bounce back			0
' in his final years in office , @entity0 plans to continue with the morning meditations , the birthday call with pastors and ad hoc prayer circles , said a senior administration official , who was n't authorized to comment by name on @entity0 's spiritual life and requested anonymity			2
privately , @entity0 also speaks to staff of being mindful of his own spiritual responsibility to the nation , the official said			0
in times of crisis , from devastating hurricanes to tragic school shootings , many @entity1 look to their president as a source of strength and comfort			0
' this office tends to make a person pray more , ' @entity0 said last year in an interview with @entity196 magazine			0
' and as president @entity84 once said , ' i have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that i had no place else to go			0
