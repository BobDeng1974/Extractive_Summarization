@entity0 accepts @entity1 should be toppling the southern hemisphere giants and takes no pride in being ' plucky runners - up '			1
successive defeats by @entity6 and @entity7 have elevated the remaining two @entity8 against @entity9 and @entity10 into matches that @entity13 's under - pressure team dare not lose			1
@entity0 is set to win his 51st cap at @entity16 on saturday as one of the changes @entity19 is expected to make , and while he remembers a time when three - point defeats to the @entity6 and @entity7 were tolerable , he insists those days are now long gone			1
@entity1 star @entity0 admits @entity13 's side should be beating southern hemisphere giants @entity1 's players look deflated after losing to @entity7 at @entity16 on saturday @entity25 flanker @entity0 looks set to earn a recall to the @entity1 back row against the @entity9 @entity27 fly half @entity28 looks set to start at number 10 on saturday with @entity31 moving to centre @entity34 centre @entity32 ( centre ) looks fresh in training at @entity37 on training @entity39 has found himself out of favour with @entity1 despite featuring heavily last season ' i have been involved with @entity1 when we were getting beaten heavily by these sides and when a narrow loss would have been acceptable , ' @entity0 said			1
' but this side has now developed to a point where we have beaten the world champions and where we ultimately should be beating these teams and be right up there			2
' it 's very easy to see us as plucky runners - up , but not one person in this entire environment has ever said that is the case			2
' no one is satisfied to only be pushing those teams close			0
we realise we want to be beating them , we should be beating them and we are doing all the things in our power to make that happen			0
' as players we are our own biggest critics			0
i do n't really read the papers because i know what i have done wrong			0
i do n't need a mark out of 10 to tell me i have done something wrong			0
' @entity7 's @entity71 celebrates on his way to scoring the opening try against @entity1 head coach @entity13 has now watched his side lose five consecutive games @entity6 and @entity7 have stormed @entity16 on successive weekends to extend @entity1 's losing run to five matches , with just 10 months left until next year 's home @entity79 is launched			1
losing to the sport 's dominant forces at the venue where all but three of the knockout games will be staged would appear to be a significant setback , but @entity0 disagrees			1
' frankly , players do n't sit here now talking about the @entity79 , what we 're going to do when we get there and how we 're going to do it , because the rugby landscape changes dramatically from month to month , ' the @entity25 back row said			0
' there 's so much rugby to be played , so yes these games are important and it would be great to have those wins in the bank , but my view is they do n't have any bearing			0
' just because we lost on saturday does n't mean we 're going to lose at the @entity79			2
@entity0 is expected to replace @entity104 ( right ) at blindside flanker against @entity9 this weekend ' we 're aware that we have to develop and we 're working hard to do that			1
i have every confidence we 'll push those teams and get the results			0
' @entity0 is expected to replace @entity104 at blindside flanker against @entity9 on saturday , with @entity111 relieving @entity112 at number eight in a new - look back row that will see @entity116 as the sole survivor			1
@entity1 have been described as a team in crisis and @entity9 and @entity10 must be dispatched if they are to salvage a measure of respect from a disappointing campaign			1
@entity0 has urged his team - mates to be bold against the @entity124 ' i hope we do n't go into our shell , that 's certainly not the impression of what will happen that i 'm getting from the guys			2
there will be boys coming into the team who want to put their hands up , ' @entity0 said			2
' our nature and game plan is n't about going into our shell			0
that just does n't work and i 've got every confidence that wo n't happen			0

@entity1 face @entity9 at @entity16 on saturday after two defeats
@entity13 's side have lost to @entity7 and @entity6
but @entity0 is *adamant* @entity1 should be winning more matches
