rumours have been circulating since the beginning of december that @entity2 is preparing to launch a supersized version of its @entity4			1
now , a leaked photo of a sketch , reportedly taken by an employee who works in a @entity9 factory in @entity10 where @entity11 are made , suggests that the rumours of an ‘ @entity13 ’ with a 12.2 inch screen , are true			1
the image seems to show a ' sketch ' of the casing for the supersized tablet , which supports previous claims that the @entity13 , also dubbed the @entity20 by speculating enthusiasts , will also boast four speakers for stereo sound			1
a leaked photo of a sketch ( pictured ) reportedly taken by an employee who works in a @entity9 factory , where @entity11 are made , suggests that the rumours of an ‘ @entity13 ’ with a 12.2 inch screen , are true the image was released by @entity33 website @entity31 , which has previously leaked details from unannounced smartphones and @entity2 gadgets which proved to be true , citing a @entity9 source			1
the source said that initial testing for the @entity13 was stopped in the summer and @entity2 ’s suppliers will soon start mass production of the tablet			1
the sketch suggests that the tablet will look similar to the @entity4 2 in design , with rounded corners and the same standby button , rear camera , microphone and volume buttons placement			1
however , seemingly confirming rumours that the larger tablet will offer stereo sound , there appears to be a speaker grill on the top of the shell			1
the @entity13 is expected to have a 12.2inch screen or even larger , dwarfing the @entity58 with its 7.9inch screen ( left ) and @entity4 air ( right ) with a 9.7 inch screen name : popular suggestions for the name of the supersized tablet include the @entity13 - taking its lead from @entity2 's @entity68 smartphone , and the @entity69 size : the tablet is rumoured to have a 12.2 inch screen , although other dimensions have also been suggested			1
rumours suggest it will be just seven millimetres thick			0
design : the leaked ' sketch ' suggests that the @entity13 will be similar in design to the @entity4 2 , with its rounded corners and also share the same placement of buttons on its edges			1
@entity82 : the image differs from the smaller tablet however , because of grilles on the top of the shell , which suggest the device will include stereo speakers , as rumoured			1
launch : sources have suggested different launch times , but there is some consensus that the tablet may make its debut before the summer			0
@entity99 magazine @entity97 claimed in december that the @entity13 will also feature a much faster a9 processor and is set to launch between april and june			1
@entity101 and other publications reported that @entity2 was planning on releasing the device sometime in early 2015 , while a recent report from @entity105 said the @entity107 firm had postponed mass production of the larger ipad from december 2014 into next year as suppliers struggled to meet demand for the @entity68 and 6 @entity13 launch			2
the designs show the gadget is just 7mm thick , but the size of the screen is uncertain , with rumours suggesting measurements between 12 inches and 12.9 inches			2
the first suggestion of a supersized tablet came just weeks after claims that the large screen size of the @entity68 plus was impacting on @entity4 usage			1
the release of @entity2 ’s @entity125 means there is now only a 2.4 - inch difference between the size of the phablet ’s screen , and the display on its ipad mini			2
analysis has revealed that as phones become larger , more people are using them for watching videos or reading - making their tablets almost redundant			0
the new larger @entity4 is expected to look like the recently launched @entity4 ( pictured ) , with rounded corners			1
leaked designs show the gadget is just 7mm thick , but this is uncertain a survey comparing the before - and - after behaviour of @entity68 and @entity4 users revealed that people with an @entity145 use their phone 55 % of the time , but this increases to 72 % for the @entity68 and 80 % for the @entity68 - both at the detriment of the @entity4 , perhaps explaining why @entity150 is planning a larger one a study by @entity154 - an app that lets users save webpages , videos and other content for reading - later found that people who recently upgraded to an @entity68 6 plus use their tablets 36 per cent less than before			1
it analysed more than two million articles and videos that were opened using the app , and compared the before and after behaviour in people who previously owned an @entity68 5 , @entity165 and @entity145 and those who now own an @entity167			0
it also looked at the use of tablets by the same people			0
@entity154 also saw users with both an @entity68 and an @entity4 watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an @entity173			2
those with the @entity68 ( centre ) opened 33 % more articles and videos inside @entity154 than they did with a @entity145 ( left ) , and those with a @entity178 ( right ) opened 65 % more items than before the @entity68 6 accounted for 68 per cent of all sales through september and into early october , while its larger model took between 23 and 24 per cent			0
@entity2 's cheaper @entity145 and 5c handsets made up the rest of the sales			0
following last year 's launch , the @entity145 and @entity165 accounted for 84 per cent of total @entity68 sales in the first 30 days - proving the 6 range is more popular			0
the skew is being blamed on reports that stocks of the @entity68 are lower because @entity2 is struggling to complete orders			0
recent figures from @entity154 also found that two - and - a - half more @entity154 users are opting for an @entity68 as opposed to a 6 @entity13			2
‘ the bigger your phone ’s screen , the more time you ’ll spend reading and watching on it , ’ explained the researchers in a blog post			0
‘ in fact , the bigger your phone ’s screen , the more you ’ll read and watch as a whole			0
’ it discovered that users who upgraded to an @entity68 6 now view content on their phones 72 per cent of the time , up from 55 per cent when they owned on a smaller screen			0
@entity154 also saw that users with both an @entity68 and an @entity4 watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an @entity173			2
but , a larger screen does make the smartphone less portable and @entity154 noticed that people with an @entity68 read 22 per cent less on their morning commutes than those with a smaller model			0
recent figures from @entity154 also found that two - and - a - half more @entity154 users are opting for an @entity68 as opposed to a 6 @entity13			2
‘ this tells us that , at least for now , convenience and portability trump a better , and bigger , entertainment and reading experience			0
