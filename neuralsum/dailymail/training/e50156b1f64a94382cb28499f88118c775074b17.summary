the spotlight in the @entity2 affair last night fell on links between multi-millionaire @entity4 and @entity6 – the wife of his close friend and billionaire clothing magnate sir @entity9			1
socialite mr @entity4 – who owns a string of @entity12 restaurants including the @entity13 and the nightclub @entity15 – visited a @entity17 branch of the bank and withdrew £ 2.25million in cash			1
the transaction took place in september 2005 and was not flagged up by the lender			0
a spokesman for sir @entity9 strongly denied his wife @entity30 had any link to @entity33 @entity2 accounts the bank recorded only that mr @entity4 planned to deposit the money ‘ in a new a / c ( account ) with a separate institution in @entity17 ’			1
he last night insisted the money was for a business transaction with people who did not want to use @entity2			0
but according to bank files seen by the @entity46 ’s @entity45 and @entity47 , funds in the @entity33 account originated from accounts in the tax haven of @entity50			1
these accounts , it is alleged , were controlled by mr @entity4 but were held ‘ in trust ’ under the name of @entity6 , sir @entity9 ’s wife			1
however , a spokesman for sir @entity9 said the allegations about his wife were untrue , adding : ‘ no such account exists , or ever has done in the past			1
’ denial : a spokesman for sir @entity9 , pictured with his wife @entity30 , said : ' there are a number of serious inaccuracies and mistakes in the @entity47 story ' leaked records from @entity2 note that ‘ rc goes to great lengths to maintain discretion ’ , and in july 2005 , he had fallen out with the bank over a ‘ currency shortfall ’ on one account			1
after a ‘ lengthy and challenging conversation ’ , the bank had been aware mr @entity4 could send ‘ funds from @entity50 at a moment ’s notice ... however , they would be accompanied by instructions to close the account			1
he expects us to consider his global relationship			0
’ in the event , the bank recorded : ‘ as we know , until now ( @entity88 ) has hesitated from holding the vast majority of his cash assets in his own name , preferring to accept the offer of mrs @entity6 that she holds them in trust on his behalf			2
’ the bank also recorded that mr @entity4 , 62 , held some £ 65.7million in offshore accounts and was also taking profits from an ‘ anonymous ’ 22 per cent holding in @entity100			1
mr @entity4 , a former @entity101 and @entity103 donor , has claimed hereditary ‘ non-domiciled ’ tax status through his @entity106 - born father , an @entity106 gi who settled in @entity109 after the @entity110			2
this , it has been suggested , enabled mr @entity4 not to disclose the existence of his @entity33 or @entity50 bank accounts to the @entity116 tax authorities , so he could avoid taxes on capital held abroad			1
the leaked files also show that mr @entity4 used his tax free account to transfer $ 1million to @entity26 and @entity122 ’s charitable foundation – seemingly in return for the @entity126 president ’s attendance at a lavish @entity128 charity ball in 2005			1
the @entity47 reports that @entity2 ’s notes contain an instruction to ‘ transfer [ $ 1m ] to @entity26 ’s foundation as a contribution following his involvement in the charity function			0
’ mr @entity4 has been friends with sir @entity9 for many years and gave him a red @entity136 for his 50th birthday			1
he once said of his relationship with the tycoon , 62 : ‘ i speak to him every day			0
we ’re more than friends – i think we ’d do anything for each other			0
’ sir @entity9 and his wife are worth more than £ 5billion and split their time between @entity12 and a @entity50 apartment			1
mr @entity4 ’s @entity149 firm still supplies sir @entity9 ’s @entity151 chain			1
last month the @entity152 contacted sir @entity9 to ask about rumours he had been listed on the stolen @entity2 computer disc as having an offshore account in @entity17			2
he replied : ‘ for the record i have never had a @entity33 bank account			2
’ he did not mention the @entity50 account that it is now claimed is controlled by mr @entity4 even though it is in the name of @entity6			1
spotlight : @entity2 is facing scrutiny after a vast cache of @entity33 bank account documents was leaked last night mr @entity4 told the @entity152 he was angry at ‘ insinuations ’ regarding his dealings with @entity2			2
he insisted he has had ‘ non-dom ’ status for many years and it was a fact known to the @entity116 tax authorities			0
‘ the revenue people have always known my non-dom status			0
i had some £ 100million in dividends from @entity100 at one stage and i paid £ 33million in regard to that matter and the revenue [ @entity177 ] was happy that i did n’t owe a single penny more in tax			2
‘ the @entity2 documents that have been widely referred to by the @entity47 and others have been known to [ @entity177 ] since 2010 and have not resulted in any taxable issues			0
‘ the insinuation that i would or want to evade tax is totally wrong			2
i have also never bullied the @entity2 bank in terms of my dealings with them			0
yes , i did withdraw more than £ 2 million from the bank and that was for a business transaction			0
‘ i appreciate it was a large amount of money but i was put in that position at the time because the people i was dealing with did not want to use @entity2 in a particular transaction			0
‘ it was a business matter and i have not bullied anyone			0
’ last night it emerged that sir @entity9 was considering legal action against @entity47 in relation to claims about the @entity2 row			1
a spokesman said : ‘ there are a number of serious inaccuracies and mistakes in the @entity47 story			0
people are allowed to have bank accounts abroad and people should ask some basic questions			0
‘ for instance , if you have a bank account in @entity33 and access to other accounts in that country there why on earth would you transfer funds from somewhere like @entity50			2
‘ for a number of reasons – including currency conversion – that would not make any sense at all			0
‘ people writing about the @entity2 issue and @entity33 bank accounts should be very careful as there has not been any impropriety			0

focus on links between @entity4 and sir @entity9 **'s** wife @entity30
nightclub tycoon mr @entity4 withdrew £ 2.25m in cash in @entity17 in 2005

@entity50 accounts , it is alleged , were ' held in trust ' in @entity6 **'s** name
but sir @entity9 strongly denies the claims , and is considering legal action
' no such account exists , or ever has done in the past ' , spokesman said
