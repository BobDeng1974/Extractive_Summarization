by @entity0 published : 05:58 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 07:11 est , 11 july 2012 it may only just be summer , but one experimental chef is already getting busy in the kitchen preparing to offer us a range of @entity6 treats we 'll remember until spring 2013			1
@entity7 , the @entity9 star - winning chef famed for the snail porridge served in his unconventional @entity12 restaurant @entity13 , has announced the festive collection he will be cooking for and selling through supermarket chain @entity15			2
and this year his menu - which arrives 167 days before the big day - is as bananas as ever			2
in fact , one dish even contains bananas ...			0
ho ho ho : chef @entity7 has already unveiled his crackers @entity6 menu for @entity15 sweet treats : @entity7 's @entity6 pudding will actually taste of chocolate brownie among the items @entity7 has devised are a traditional fruit cake that looks like a @entity6 pudding but is decorated in white chocolate and tastes like a chocolate brownie - after all , why have one dessert when you can have three ? there will also be a cranberry sauce made with vodka , a bread sauce with truffle oil and a gammon baked in mulled cider			1
one of the festive favourites promises to be a baked @entity41 with a raspberry parfait , encased in chocolate , surrounded by a caremalised banana parfait instead of ice cream			1
but none of these offerings should come as much of a surprise to anyone who knows the sort of cooking @entity7 is famous for			0
last year the chef brought us pine - sugar mince pies that smelled like @entity6 trees , the year before was all about the @entity56 , so popular it sold out two years running and was eventually being sold on @entity57 for £ 250			1
anyone who missed out on the pudding last year should n't worry too much , as they will be able to try again this time around when it goes on sale for the third year in a row			2
speaking about his baked @entity41 , @entity7 said : ' @entity64 is a childhood favourite of mine			0
i love the juxtaposition of the soft meringue against the smooth creamy interior , but i hated the idea that it all melted so quickly			0
' so i was inspired to create my take on the old school classic by creating a raspberry mousse centre which gave the creaminess without melting and adding one of my favourite flavours – bananas ! ' @entity80 gobble : @entity7 's @entity81 , left , which has sold out two years running , and , right , the trifle featured in his recipe book @entity83 @entity15 spokesman @entity86 said : ' in recent years @entity7 has really captured our shopper ’s imagination at @entity6			1
' i ’m sure that just like our @entity6 puddings his version of the @entity64 will be extremely popular with @entity15 shoppers this @entity6			1
' the @entity7 from @entity15 range will be available from october 2012			0
it seems @entity7 's fellow @entity15 chef patron @entity95 had better get experimenting if she wants to compete for our attention ...			0
smoke and mirrors : @entity7 toils over a hot cauldron in his lab in @entity12 , just next door to his restaurant @entity13			0
