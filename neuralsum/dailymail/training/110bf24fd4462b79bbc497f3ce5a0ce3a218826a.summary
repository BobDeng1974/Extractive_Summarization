cruise holidays are becoming more popular than ever and companies hve an ingenious way of squeezing in extra passengers			2
instead of building new ships , at huge cost , cruise lines such as @entity5 are simply cutting their ships in half and adding extra sections , before ' sewing ' them back up again			1
these incredible photographs show how the @entity14 is taken apart almost like @entity15 , and a new section is fitted in the middle at the @entity19 shipyard in @entity20 , @entity21			1
the work to lengthening and refit the vessel will now include the addition of dedicated kids ' club areas sponsored by - rather fittingly - @entity15 and @entity46			0
the huge project is only expected to take 10 weeks in total , extending the ship in time for trials before it starts carrying passengers again in november			0
the £ 150 million ( € 200 million ) ' @entity53 project ' is part of a huge scale upgrade to the fleet - adding 79ft midsections to four different ships			2
@entity19 's world - class marine engineers have carefully bisected @entity14 's hull , after which the two halves of the ships were slowly drawn apart			1
the interior of the cruise ship is there for all to see after the incision sees the ship cut into two in @entity20 , @entity68 the work to lengthening and refit the vessel over the next 10 weeks will now include the addition of dedicated kids ' club areas @entity5 will refit and renew much of the ship 's interior , bringing an enhanced sense of comfort and space the ship 's @entity77 will also be enriched with additional massage areas , and a new outdoor spray park will be added on deck 13 this week they will insert a @entity84 , 79ft midsection containing 193 extra cabins			1
then they will refit and renew much of the ship 's interior , bringing an enhanced sense of comfort and space			0
before @entity14 's arrival , @entity19 's preparations were already well under way for the work on board and in the shipyard			1
on january 9 , the new midsection was floated into the shipyard and hauled into the dry - dock area where @entity14 will remain for the duration of its stay			0
once the work is complete and sea trials completed , the larger , smarter @entity14 will weigh anchor from the shipyard on march 25 for @entity105 , from where it will begin for a maiden cruise to @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110			2
once the work is complete and sea trials completed , the larger , smarter @entity14 will weigh anchor from the shipyard for @entity105 the project is expected to take 10 weeks in total , extending the ship in time for trials before it starts carrying passengers again in november these photographs show how quite literally the ship is split in two to prepare for the new section that will mean more passengers paying on @entity5 executive director @entity124 and @entity127 @entity126 said : ' everyone at @entity5 loves our partnerships with @entity15 and @entity46 – they are two fantastic internationally - renowned brands			1
it is great news that we are giving families even more opportunity to enjoy these facilities by adding them to @entity14			0
' @entity5 currently carries roughly 40,000 guests per day , but by 2022 will double its capacity to 80,000 guests a day – 3.4 million per year – once the @entity141 is completed and the last of seven planned ships is delivered .			0
