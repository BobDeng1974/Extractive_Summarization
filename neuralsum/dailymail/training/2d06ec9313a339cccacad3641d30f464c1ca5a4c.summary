by @entity1 reporter published : 10:25 est , 20 october 2013 updated : 10:27 est , 20 october 2013 more than three dozen people who were brought into a @entity4 state jail on misdemeanor charges have come forward claiming inappropriate conduct and invasion of privacy after they were allegedly forced to strip naked on camera			1
the total number of complaints have tripled since 11 women and one man filed a lawsuit against @entity15 city jail in august , claiming cameras in their holding cells recorded their most intimate moments as they changed into jail uniforms or used the bathroom			1
' you 're basically treated like an animal , like a piece of meat , ' one victim told @entity26			1
' and these people are supposed to be upholding the law			0
' almost all complainants were being held on suspected dui offenses , for which they are typically released in a matter of hours			1
' what possible security reason could they have ... she 's going to hand herself with her panties ? ' said @entity60 attorney @entity59 , whose law firm is handling the case			2
' she 's about to be released and out the door			2
' @entity59 has obtained several surveillance tapes from @entity66 jail through public record requests , which were released to @entity26			1
he said the women were unaware their actions were being recorded on a monitor that was watched by mostly mail jailers			2
scene : the jail at the center of the action is inside this @entity76 in @entity4 leading the case : @entity60 attorney @entity59 first filed a lawsuit on behalf of 11 women and one man in august			1
he has since been contacted by more than two dozen other people with similar stories attorney 's acting on behalf of @entity15 city jail say the camera operations inside the facility are standard practive one woman from @entity90 , who chose not to be identified , was arrested for suspected drunk driving in april and said she refused to change her clothes until a female officer was present because she was comfortable with the four male guards nearby			1
' basically i was harassed for not doing it and put back in the holding cell and made to stay there for about 12 hours , ' the woman said			0
another woman said there was no reason for her to strip naked			0
' i thought maybe it was for seeing if we have contraband of something , but we are already patted down , ' she said			0
' so then why would there be a camera still ? ' ' i just did n't feel comfortable with the situation so i was n't going to do it ' : this woman , who asked not to be identified , refused to undress on camera after being arrested on suspected drunk driving jail experts say such levels surveillance were extremely unusual			2
@entity117 , an architect who has designed 40 jails , said he was ' stunned ' by the recently released videos			2
' we do have lots of cameras but ( usually ) you can not watch anywhere where someone is using the shower , toilet facilities or a changing area , ' @entity117 told @entity26			0
however @entity131 attorney @entity130 , speaking on behalf of the jail , said placing cameras in common areas and cells was standard practice and that there are no plans to change such methods			1
' the jail videos we 've watched so far do n't show any inappropriate activity , ' @entity130 said			0
@entity142 attorney @entity130 maintained jail officers had acted ' very professionally ' ' in fact the corrections officers are acting very professionally			1
