the car had no seat belt or shoulder harness , only a single lap or ' t - bar ' to restrain passengers , @entity181 reported			0
' as the roller - coaster was in its first large descent , @entity171 's daughter heard screaming and yelling behind her , and turned to see her mother in the process of being thrown out of the car , out from behind the safety in her seat , ' the suit states			1

' devastating : @entity31 's family is suing @entity124 for negligence after the tragic accident the suit states @entity31 's daughter and son - in - law were forced to complete the ride for ' what seemed like an interminable time knowing that @entity171 had been thrown out of the ride and not knowing whether she was dead or seriously injured and in need of immediate medical attention '			1

in 2006 , nine park patrons were injured on the @entity300 when one of the mechanical bearings that spins the ride malfunctioned			0
' more often than not , the response of the @entity4 defendants to roller - coaster tragedies at their parks has been merely to feign surprise and to belatedly add safety belts in an attempt to calm the public 's fears , ' the lawsuit states			0
@entity181 also reports the suit states that inspections done on the roller coasters since @entity31 's death ' showed that various parts of the security systems on the ride were experiencing inconsistencies and intermittent failures			1
