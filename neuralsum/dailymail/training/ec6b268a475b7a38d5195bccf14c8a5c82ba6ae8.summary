she said : ‘ i do n’t know if she and @entity23 will be close again but i believe @entity9 will find her soul mate ’			1
losing her cool : the heckler said that the first lady ' got up in her face ' striking a deal : she offered the choice of her leaving or the heckler with the crowd cheering for her , she headed back on stage to continue the talk on education she added that @entity16 had gotten into trouble in the past because of her ‘ big mouth			1
