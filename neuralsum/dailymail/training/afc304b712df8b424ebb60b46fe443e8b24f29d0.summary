the ‘ @entity4 ’ was @entity1 ’s evocative description to sum up the raucous atmosphere that pervaded at @entity3 in 2006			1
now , on @entity8 ’s return next week , one of the people has qualified to play			1
nothing sums up the unique spot the tournament holds in our glorious summer of sport than the feelgood story of @entity16			1
the 30 - year - old makes his living driving a forklift truck in a resin factory some 10 minutes from @entity21			1
at 4.30pm , he clocks off and makes his way down to @entity24 golf club to practise			2
his dreams of making it as a pro have gone but there ’s no trace of bitterness			0
‘ i was lucky to get the job i ’ve got and i ’m happy with what i ’m doing , ’ he said			0
scouse proud : local man @entity16 defied the odds to qualify for the @entity34 it was pregnant fiancee @entity36 who persuaded him to try to qualify for @entity8 , with it being on the doorstep and all			1
poor @entity16 took one look at the dilapidated state of his two wedges and decided there was no point turning up for qualifying at @entity46 with them			1
so he borrowed a couple off his mate			0
at @entity46 that blessed day there were 72 players chasing three spots			2
there was @entity54 , the gilded teenager who has just turned pro. established @entity57 men like @entity58 and @entity59			0
young amateurs who do nothing else but play golf ; hardened pros who make a living winning regional @entity67 events			1
who shot the lowest score of the afternoon play ? @entity16			1
who came through a nerve - wracking play - off following the scheduled 36 holes to earn his spot alongside @entity75 , @entity76 and the rest ? the factory man			1
as he was driving to work last friday , @entity16 spotted the mate who had lent him the two wedges			1
‘ we just looked at each other and burst out laughing at the craziness of it all , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s every golfer ’s dream to play in @entity8 and now it ’s happening to me on my doorstep			1
it ’s a bit overwhelming to be honest			0
’ to help get over the shock and awe , @entity16 took a look around the course last week			1
at the magnificent wraparound grandstand at the 18th that is going to give this @entity8 a carnival flavour			1
‘ i do n’t think it ’s going to hit me until i see the people in the stands , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s just a dream come true			0
’ loan star : @entity16 , 30 , qualified for the tournament using a borrowed set of clubs @entity16 ’s love of the game is such he was due to have been a volunteer marshall next week			1
instead his job inside the ropes will be the most glamorous one of all			0
no doubt the winner will come from the upper echelons of the game , just as it did back in 2006 when @entity75 won			0
but it ’s the @entity114 who make the event unlike any other major sporting occasion			0
the men who return to their day jobs but who can always say that for one week at least they rubbed shoulders with giants and played in @entity8			2
can i suggest those in charge of the qualifying criteria for the @entity125 , which takes place at @entity127 this week , have a rethink ? @entity129 finished third on her pro debut at the @entity131 last month			0
unfair : @entity132 was forced to qualify for the @entity125 despite recent third place finishes the brilliant 21 - year - old from @entity135 followed that up by shooting a final - round 63 to finish third again in the @entity138 ’s flagship event on sunday			2
one of those performances should have earned her an exemption			2
an equivalent performance certainly would have done so in the men ’s game			0
instead , she had to endure the rigours of qualifying yesterday			0
that ’s just not right			0
soothsayer : @entity149 's prediction saw him win a second @entity150 ‘ what i need to do is shoot a 66 or 67 in the final round , because there ’s a 76 lying in wait for any man out there			1
’ that was how @entity149 called it on saturday evening , after falling eight behind @entity162 @entity161 at the @entity163			2
the following day he shot 67 to @entity161 ’s 76 to not only defend his title successfully but display an enviable line in prophecy			0
outside the usual summer staples , the highlights next year must be an @entity8 at @entity169 and an ashes test match at @entity171			1
and , to the considerable annoyance of the many who would like to watch both , they will clash			2
clash : the 2016 @entity8 at @entity169 will played at the same time as the @entity178 test match at @entity171 this will be the third time since 2009 this has happened but a clash with a @entity183 is particularly grievous			1
who ’s to blame ? certainly not the @entity186 , who announce the @entity8 dates years in advance			2
i ’m told @entity190 , who hold the cricket rights , are culpable			0
@entity190 do so many good things when it comes to golf that it ’s a shame they let themselves down with this harmful act towards the biggest event of all .			0

@entity16 has qualified to play at @entity8 at @entity3
local man is a forklift driver for a living but earned one of three spots
@entity149 's *accurate* prediction saw him win a second @entity210
@entity212 will have to qualify for @entity214 open despite form
the @entity8 2015 at @entity169 will clash with @entity218 's ashes at @entity171
