by @entity0 last updated at 5:10 pm on 28th february 2012 when @entity3 's most famous new town @entity4 was built in 1967 it quickly became the target of ridicule for its soulless buildings and grid systems			0
but even its infamous concrete cows have not put off developers from attempting to build @entity3 's biggest new town			2
plans have today been revived for the creation of @entity14 , a 10,000 home development northwest of @entity16			1
plans : an artist 's impression of @entity14 , the new @entity20 town which , if it goes ahead , could house up to 25,000 people development : northstowe will have 150 houses built in the initial phase , followed by 650 by 2016 the town , which was once seen as the prototype for @entity28 's now - abandoned ecotown programme , could take up to two decades to complete and could be home to up to 25,000 people			1
the initial phase of development for the town will see the creation of a primary school , sports hub , shops and a recycling centre			1
the joint promoters of the @entity14 project , @entity40 and the @entity41 , consulted with the public before submitted plans for 1,500 new homes today			1
ambitious : the plans for @entity14 could take up to 25 years to fully complete developers hope that as well as providing green , sustainable homes , @entity14 will also have a mix of executive homes , as well as low - cost and social housing			1
@entity52 , @entity53 's cabinet member for @entity14 and new communities , said : ' we are delighted the application for the first phase of new homes and community facilities at @entity14 has now been submitted as the town is vital to responding to the acute housing need in south @entity20			1
' it will bring with it new jobs , a major boost for our flourishing economy , and will help address the need for affordable homes			2
' we are very clear that the proposals must be best for existing and future communities and the views of our residents are key to that			0
' this is to be our new town and all of us locally are determined to make it work well for everyone			0
' @entity53 will now work with @entity78 to assess the application			2
@entity80 plans : northstowe will be the biggest new town built in this country since @entity4 in the 1960s @entity84 - a group of 12 local parish councils near to the proposed new town - have helped with the preparation of the plan			0
a decision on the plans is expected to take up to a year			0
plans for @entity14 's second phase will be prepared over the summer , while later developments would include a town centre and a secondary school			1
@entity96 , the @entity41 area manager , said : ' the joint promoters are confident @entity14 can be delivered and have adopted a new phased approach to delivering housing as part of the comprehensive development of the wider vision for @entity14 as a new community			1
' @entity40 submitting the phase one application is fully supported by the @entity41 as it is part of the revised master plan for the whole site , the majority of which @entity41 owns			0
it â€™s therefore a major milestone for the project as a whole			0
inspiration ? @entity4 now has a population of over 230,000 after it was made in 1967 iconic : the concrete cows built in @entity4 have become a landmark in the @entity118 town ' we remain committed to delivering @entity14 with all the benefits it will bring to the local and wider area and together the joint promoters will be working together on preliminary plans for a phase two over the summer			1
' @entity14 , built five miles north - west of @entity16 , will be the @entity3 's biggest new town since @entity4			2
the town , known as @entity127 to locals , was formally designated a town in 1967 , having incorporated the existing towns of @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			0
arguably the biggest ( and perhaps only ) landmark in @entity4 is the collection of concrete cows , which were built in 1978 by @entity138 artist @entity137			0
she is thought to have created them as a leaving present to the @entity141 before she returned to the @entity138 the @entity118 town was created to help ease housing overspill in @entity144 , and now has a population of around 232,000 .			0

northstowe will take 20 years to finish but could have population of 25,000
initial development will build primary school and sports hub
