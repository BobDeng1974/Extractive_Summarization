that 's not what i meant : documentary filmmaker @entity3 stirred up controversy on @entity5 this weekend by calling snipers ' cowards '			1
he has since backtracked to say the comments were not meant in relation to the late @entity10 , or the recently - released movie based on his memoir , @entity13 @entity3 claims he did n't mean to offend the memory of @entity10 when he wrote a series of tweets yesterday calling snipers ' cowards '			1
the @entity19 - nominated documentary filmmaker wrote a lengthy @entity21 post today clarifying his statements , saying they were not intended as a criticism of the movie @entity13 , based on @entity10 's bestselling memoir			1
the @entity27 became the deadliest sniper in @entity30 military history for shooting dead at least 160 during tours of duty in the @entity33 , but was tragically killed just four years after he was discharged by a fellow soldier who was allegedly struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder			0
@entity3 caused an uproar on @entity5 on sunday , when he tweeted his thoughts on snipers			1
' my uncle killed by sniper in @entity42			0
we were taught snipers were cowards			1
will shoot u in the back			0
and invaders r worse , ' the fahrenheit 9/11 director said			2
' but if you 're on a roof of your home defending it from invaders who 've come miles , you are not a sniper , u are brave , u are a neighbor , ' he added			0
after an onslaught of criticism , @entity3 tweeted again today to claim he was not talking about either @entity10 or the film , pointing out the fact that he did n't mention either directly in his tweets			1
i never tweeted 1word bout @entity63 / @entity62			0
i said my uncle killed by sniper in @entity42 ; only cowards would do that 2 him , others , ' he said			2
he went on to write about his mixed - feelings towards the film in a protracted @entity21 post , saying that while some aspects of the movie were praise - worthy , director @entity70 ( noted staunch @entity73 ) did n't cover the history surrounding the @entity75 to @entity3 's liking			1
@entity10 was credited with the most confirmed kills in @entity30 military history but tragically died a few years after leaving the military ' awesome performance from @entity80			1
one of the best of the year			0
costumes , hair , makeup superb ! ' oh ... and too bad @entity70 gets @entity92 and @entity93 confused in his storytelling			1
and that he has his characters calling @entity93 " savages " throughout the film			1
' but there is also anti-war sentiment expressed in the movie			2
and there 's a touching ending as the main character is remembered after being gunned down by a fellow @entity30 vet with @entity105 who was given a gun at a gun range back home in @entity109 - and then used it to kill the man who called himself the ' @entity111 '			1
@entity13 has been nominated for six @entity19 including @entity112 and @entity113			1
anger : @entity3 took to @entity5 with his views on snipers the day after @entity13 was widely released family : @entity3 's uncle was shot dead by a @entity120 sniper during @entity42 , so the topic of snipers hits close to home clarification : the following day he clarified that his comments did not mention @entity13 or @entity10 critiques : however , he went on to write out his mixed - feelings about the film in a lengthy @entity21 post history : @entity3 wrote that while many aspects of the film were well done , he was not happy with director @entity70 's depiction of the @entity75 the film , which is based on @entity10 ’s autobiography of the same title reveals not only how he became so successful , but also how the trauma of fighting in @entity93 never left him			1
raised in rural @entity109 , @entity10 started out as a cowboy and his initial application to join the @entity27 was turned down because a rodeo accident had left him with metal pins in his arms			1
however , in the late nineties , the unit relaxed its entrance policy and @entity10 was put through the fearsomely tough selection and training regime			1
in 2003 , he was deployed to @entity93 , where he made his first long - distance kills even though he had not been trained as sniper			2
with an obvious talent , he was sent to the @entity27 sniper school , where he was taught warfare ’s loneliest and most controversial job			0
true story : the movie is based on @entity10 's autobiography , written before he was shot dead in february 2013 @entity19 - tipped : @entity70 's movie is hotly - tipped to pick up a few @entity19 , including @entity112 for @entity80 in 2004 , @entity10 was posted to @entity157 , west of @entity158 and a major battleground of @entity93 insurgency , and it was during the battle for that city where he made his mark			1
however , it was in 2006 in @entity166 , a city in central @entity93 , that @entity10 gained his nickname as ‘ @entity168 ’ from his fellow @entity27			1
one day , while positioned on a roof , @entity10 watched a moped coming down a street			1
riding it were two men , one of whom dropped a backpack into a pothole			0
a sniper is a highly trained military marksman , whose job is to engage targets from concealed postitions or from long distances			0
they usually operate alone or in small groups and use highly specialised weapons to take out their targets			0
it is believed the first use of snipers came during the @entity190 when colonists hid in trees and used early rifles to shoot @entity195 officers			2
the first unit of marksmen was established by the @entity195 army during the napoleonic wars and the team were nicknamed the @entity201 due to their distinctive green uniform			0
snipers were widely used in the trenches during the @entity204 , with @entity205 equipping their fighters with scoped rifles , which could easily pick out targets			2
in the @entity42 , @entity195 and @entity210 snipers were credited with halting the @entity205 advance			0
the longest recorded sniper kill was carried out by corporal @entity213 of the @entity195 army 's @entity214 when he two killed two @entity217 machine gunners from more than a mile and a half away in @entity219 in november 2009			0
he was using the @entity195 - built @entity220 , the @entity222 's most powerful sniper weapon			1
realising that it contained an improvised explosive , @entity10 took a shot at the speeding moped from a range of 150 yards			2
the bullet hit one of the riders , passed through him , and hit the other			0
in 2009 , after four tours of @entity93 , @entity10 retired			2
he had not only shot more of the enemy than any other @entity30 sniper but had also gained himself a chestful of medals , including three @entity236 for gallantry			0
in february 2013 he was shot dead by a soldier he was trying to help who was suffering from severe post-traumatic stress			0
the movie of @entity10 's life is hotly tipped for glory at the @entity19 , after being nominated for six awards including @entity112 for @entity80 and @entity113			1
it has also been tipped for best adapted screenplay , sound mixing , film editing and sound editing			0
@entity3 won an @entity19 in 2002 for his documentary @entity250 , exploring gun violence in @entity30 and the main reasons for the @entity254 massacre			1
he is outspoken in his views against firearms and has previously described @entity30 's national symbol as the gun , not the bald eagle			0
last year @entity3 wrote on his @entity21 page that that while other countries have more violent histories than the @entity30 , more guns per capita and consume the same violent movies and video games as the @entity30 , none have anywhere near the rates of mass killings that @entity30 does			2
he explained : ' the bloodshed is just the latest in what is fast becoming a regular occurrence in the @entity30 , and one that is sure to happen again , says @entity3			2
' we wo n't pass the necessary laws , but more importantly we wo n't consider why this happens here all the time , ' he writes			0
' when the @entity285 says , " guns do n't kill people - people kill people , " they 've got it half - right			0
except i would amend it to this : " guns do n't kill people - @entity30 kill people			0
" enjoy the rest of your day , and rest assured this will all happen again very soon			0

the documentary filmmaker caused controversy on sunday by tweeting that snipers are cowards
@entity3 's tweets *corresponded* with the wide release of the film @entity13 , which raked in a record *$* *103.5million* this weekend
however , he later said the comments were not directed at the movie or real - life @entity10 who was the *inspiration*
he went on to praise @entity80 's acting , while calling out director @entity70 's ' confused ' portrayal of the @entity75
