detective chief inspector @entity60 , who led the inquiry into the @entity34 , told the inquest that mr @entity9 and another street drinker called @entity64 were picked up by @entity19			1
he found them towards the end of 2000 as they hitchhiked , were offered work and accommodation , and took them to @entity71			2
other family members : @entity75 's sons @entity73 ( left ) , 29 , and @entity77 ( centre ) , 20 , and their son - in - law @entity78 ( right ) , 24 , were also jailed at @entity79 last december ‘ @entity64 stated they were paid a pittance , not even a tenner a day , ’ mr @entity60 said			2
‘ mr @entity64 and @entity9 would tout for work on behalf of @entity19			1
both of them gave their benefit books to @entity87 and neither ever saw the benefits again			0
‘ sometimes when their benefits were cashed the @entity34 would buy them a small amount of food			0

@entity9 would get slapped by him if he came back from touting without a job			2

‘ the following day @entity64 attended @entity71 police station and took responsibility for causing the damage to the driveway , ’ mr @entity60 said			0
bad treatment : @entity19 is pictured ( left ) with one of the men ( right ) - often homeless drifters or addicts , who were beaten and forced to work for as little as £ 5 a day ‘ he was subsequently charged , pleaded guilty and sentenced to two months ' imprisonment			1
he was put up to doing that by @entity19 and he actually used it as a means to escape from the @entity34			2
‘ he served some five weeks imprisonment and lied to @entity125 about when he was to be released and was able to leave without him knowing and never returned to the family			2
' he appears like other unfortunate men to have fallen under the malign influence and control of the @entity19 family ' deputy @entity16 coroner @entity131 ‘ he left prison on march 4 , 2005 and went to @entity133 and never saw @entity9 again			1
‘ but while he was in prison he received a letter from @entity19 saying @entity9 was “ no good anymore ” and he had put £ 50 in each pocket and sent him on his way			1
‘ mr @entity64 said that having fled he was n't going to go back to be " a slave - as that 's all you are is a slave , you 're not a person like a workman			0
do this , do that , do this , do that ... "			0
‘ we concluded that @entity19 and @entity87 ran a criminal enterprise which consisted of recruiting vulnerable men and using them as cheap or free labour to build driveways or do domestic work around various sites they owned			1
‘ during our inquiry we identified 37 men who had worked for the family in this way			2
@entity9 was one such man			2
‘ their sons , @entity73 and @entity34 , were brought up and entered this way of life as did their son - in - law @entity78			0
police raid : bizarrely , the @entity19 family kept money in a toilet at one of their caravans in @entity16 ‘ it is clear from the accounts of those victims that they were cruelly exploited and subject to threats and violence and in many cases had their benefits stolen			1
‘ they all lived in poor conditions , worked long hours and survived on no more than £ 10 a day			0
a number of victims have described workers being ' fly - tipped ' when they were no longer of any use to the family			0
‘ they explained this as workers being driven off a site and dumped leaving them to fend for themselves			0
‘ it would seem that following @entity9 's accident he was of less use to the @entity19 family as a hawker			1
his speech had been affected and his gait had been affected			0
‘ it is the view of the police inquiry that it is highly likely that in early march 2005 @entity9 was ' fly - tipped ' by @entity19 and @entity87 whilst still suffering the consequences of his accident			1
@entity19 , 52 , wife @entity24 , 48 , their sons , @entity73 , 29 , and @entity77 , 20 , and son - in - law @entity78 , 24 , were jailed in december last year after being convicted of conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour			1

the profits funded a luxury cruise around the @entity213 and exotic holidays to @entity214 and @entity215 in @entity216			0
as well as holidays , they drove around in top - of - the - range cars , including a silver @entity221 saloon , a @entity223 , a red @entity225 convertible , a @entity227 pick - up , a @entity228 and a @entity221 van , and had built up a mounting property portfolio potentially now worth millions of pounds			0
the @entity34 ' enterprise came to an end when police raided sites in @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity235 in @entity236 and @entity237 in @entity238 in march 2011 following a lengthy surveillance operation			1
‘ at that time he would have had no access to benefits and no means to housing or to provide for himself			0
‘ we have been unable to establish the circumstances of @entity9 's death due in no small part to the passage of time between his death and discovery			2
‘ there is no cause of death and no overtly suspicious circumstances			0
there is no evidence to link members of the @entity34 ' family directly to his death			0
’ the inquest heard that mr @entity9 ' benefits continued to be cashed until march 2006 when letters were returned to the @entity265 stating he no longer lived at the caravan site			1
a post mortem examination could not confirm any cause of death due to the decomposition of the remains			0
mr @entity9 was identified by dna recovered from a tooth			2
mr @entity9 's father @entity73 and step - mother did not attend today 's hearing , although his daughter @entity277 did			2
she did not wish to speak after the inquest			0
recording an open verdict , deputy @entity16 coroner @entity131 said : ‘ he appears like other unfortunate men to have fallen under the malign influence and control of the @entity19 family			1
’ ‘ he was used as cheap labour up to and even after his road traffic accident on october 30 , 2003 , which left him with debilitating injuries			0
’ mr @entity131 added : ‘ where he died can not be ascertained with any degree of certainty			0
it is not known if he was brought by others to the shed or made his own way there before dying			0
‘ when he died can not be ascertained with any precision			0
how he died can not be ascertained due to the length of time the body remained undiscovered			0
‘ the police evidence confirms there is no evidence available to link any other person to his death			0
‘ what actually happened to @entity9 after the @entity19 family appeared to have considered him of no further use remains unknown as far as the police inquiry is concerned			1
‘ there is n't sufficient evidence to the necessary standard of proof to enable me to record any substantive conclusion explaining further how @entity9 came about his death			2
‘ the law requires me to enter an open verdict			0
