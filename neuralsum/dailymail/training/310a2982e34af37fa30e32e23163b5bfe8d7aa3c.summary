the recent spate of @entity3 fence jumpers represents just a fraction of the total number of people who breached barricades at the @entity3 throughout the last five years , the @entity0 says			1
a total of 40 people have illegally crossed into restricted areas outside the @entity3 in fiscal years 2009 through 2014 the agency told @entity12 on friday , according to the @entity13			1
that 's more than twice as many as ex-secret service director @entity15 intimated in testimony before @entity12 in late september			1
of the 40 barrier - jumping incidents that the @entity0 says occurred , just 10 involved individuals hopping the permanent fencing outside the @entity3 , acting @entity0 director @entity42 told the @entity43 in a letter on friday			1
the other 30 bypassed temporary blockades surrounding the complex such as police tape or movable metal barricades			1
the examiner says most of those people were under the influence of drugs or alcohol or both			0
several claimed to taking a shortcut to the @entity56 and a handful of others were out of towners who reportedly told police they did n't realize they were breaking the law			0
still the @entity0 arrests all but two of those individuals , the examiner says			0
one law - breaker violated a barrier to get a ' better view of the @entity3			2
' two scaled @entity69 to ' better display their signs during an anti-war demonstration			0
' a more serious breach in 2010 involved a person ' rambling religious references ' and having ' hallucinations ' as he charged the @entity3 , threatening to assassinate the president			1
on @entity80 in 2011 a man dressed up as @entity79 skirted a barrier at @entity82 after having proclaimed at the @entity3 earlier that day that the president owed him a significant amount of money			2
also included in the @entity0 's report to @entity12 , according to the examiner , is a february 2013 episode in which a mentally ill man ignored security measures and stormed the @entity3 trying to validate the president 's existence			1
' he believed he was no longer a real person and felt that the president possessed the ability to reinstate him , ' the report stated			0
of the 40 incident , 30 bypassed temporary blockades surrounding the complex such as police tape or movable metal barricades like the ones seen here in front of the @entity3 on september 22 four individuals have jumped the permanent fencing at 1600 @entity107 this year alone			1
that number does not include mentally ill man , @entity109 , who assaulted two dogs on the @entity3 lawn			2
because that episode took place in october , after the end of the 2014 fiscal year , it will be counted as part of next year 's stats just this year four people made it over the permanent barrier outside of 1600 @entity107 and onto the lawn of the @entity3			1
that includes @entity124 - the man who evaded multiple security officers and ran through the government building until he was tackled by an off - duty agent - but not the mentally ill man , @entity109 , who assaulted two dogs while attempting to make his way into the building several weeks ago			0
because that episode took place in october , it will be counted as part of next year 's stats			2
the government fiscal year ends on september 30 , therefore the @entity0 report only includes incidents through that date			1
the other three instances this year occurred in march , july and september			2
few details were released at the time about the march 30 intrusion other than to confirm that it happened and charges were being pressed against the unidentified male jumper			0
the examiner says that he was stopped by a k - 9 unit , however , and was subsequently treated at a hospital			0
the news publication says that another mentally ill man jumped the fence sometime in july in hopes of giving his musical recordings to the president			2
he was arrested and ordered not to return to the premises			0
in september two men , @entity124 , and a hardcore @entity159 fan scaled the @entity3 fencing			1
the affair with @entity124 took place on september 19			0
the other intrusion came days prior on september 11			0
@entity3 reporters who witnessed the first incident snapped photos of @entity0 tackling a man wearing a yellow hat bearing the image of @entity159 character @entity170			2
he was also carrying a stuffed replica of video game character			0
the report obtained by the @entity13 and released on monday night calls into question the congressional testimony of former @entity177 , who told a committee during a september 30 hearing that 16 people had jumped the fence since the fall of 2009			1
' in addition to fence - jumpers , over the last five years hundreds of individuals have approached the @entity3 perimeter , verbalizing threats to our protectees or acting in a suspicious manner , ' @entity184 said that the time			1
' officers and agents routinely leverage their experience and training to make decisions to either arrest or transfer these individuals to appropriate facilities for mental health evaluations			0
' @entity184 , who resigned the following day amid intense political pressure , did not detail every incident she considered to be a true barricade breach			0
however , the numbers provided in her testimony do not align with the @entity0 's latest report to @entity12 in which the agency listed 40 cases of barrier - jumping .			1

that 's more than twice as many as ex-secret service director @entity15 intimated in testimony before @entity12 in late september
just 10 incidents involved individuals hopping the permanent fencing outside the @entity3 ; the other 30 bypassed temporary blockades
an additional seven people made it into restricted areas inside the @entity3 , including @entity32 of @entity34 stars @entity35 and @entity36
four individuals have jumped the fence in the last year alone
