@entity1 rugby fans have been urged by campaigners to stop singing the popular @entity3 hit ' delilah ' because of its controversial lyrics			1
former @entity7 president @entity6 has called on supporters at @entity10 's @entity9 to find something else to sing , claiming the 1968 song ' trivialises the idea of murdering a woman '			2
the song includes the lyrics : ' at break of day when that man drove away , i was waiting			2
however , a campaign to ban it has now been launched the @entity26 sing before the @entity27 between @entity24 and @entity28 last month ' i cross the street to her house and she opened the door			1
' she stood there laughing ...			0
i felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more			0
' @entity6 , who held his senior role with @entity7 , the @entity7 , from 2003 to 2010 , is also a folk singer			0
a general view of the exterior of @entity10 's @entity9 i saw the light on the night that i passed by her window i saw the flickering shadows of love on her blind she was my woman as she deceived me i watched and went out of my mind my , my , my , @entity21 why , why , why , @entity21 i could see that girl was no good for me but i was lost like a slave that no man could free at break of day when that man drove away , i was waiting i cross the street to her house and she opened the door she stood there laughing i felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more my , my , my @entity21 why , why , why @entity21 so before they come to break down the door forgive me delilah i just could nâ€™t take any more quoted in several national newspapers , he said : ' it is a song about murder and it does tend to trivialise the idea of murdering a woman and it 's a pity these words now have been elevated to the status of a secondary national anthem			1
i think we should rummage around for another song instead of @entity21			2
' the @entity75 appears disinclined to ban the song , with a spokesman quoted by the @entity78 as saying : ' within rugby , @entity21 has gained prominence through its musicality rather than because of its lyrics			1
' there is , however , plenty of precedent in art and literature , prominently in @entity90 tragedies for instance , for negative aspects of life to be portrayed			0
' the @entity75 condemns violence against women and has taken a lead role in police campaigns to highlight and combat the issue			0
' the @entity75 remains willing to listen to any strong public debate on the issue of censoring the use of @entity21 but we have not been aware of any groundswell of opinion on this matter			1
' @entity21 , written by @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 , tells of an opportunistic killing by a man , who waits until his former partner 's lover leaves her home before making his move			0
the song is also commonly sung by supporters of @entity118 football club @entity117 .			1
