by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor a magistrate friend of sir @entity4 tried to cover up allegations of sexual abuse against the politician by warning off police investigating the claims , it has emerged			1
a report written by a senior detective in 1970 revealed the magistrate made ' veiled threats ' to officers , telling him he did not feel the issue was ' court worthy '			1
it found there was ' prima facie ' evidence @entity4 had indecently assaulted youngsters , but it did not go any further			1
a magistrate friend of @entity23 mp sir @entity4 said it was not ' court worthy ' to prosecute him over allegations of indecent assault the 14 - page report released last night by the @entity29 was compiled by a detective superintendent for @entity32 's chief constable @entity31			1
it was written during an investigation into allegations that sir @entity4 had sexually abused eight teenage boys in the 1960s by spanking and touching them , six of them at the privately - run @entity41 children 's care home in @entity42			1
the officer , whose name has been concealed in the heavily redacted report , said there was ' prima facie ' evidence that sir @entity4 was guilty of indecent assault and that the then @entity23 prospective parliamentary candidate would have been ' at the mercy of any competent counsel ' if he were prosecuted			1
but he said a magistrate friend of sir @entity4 had warned officers against proceeding with the inquiry			1
three separate files on the issue were later passed to the director of public prosecutions and the @entity29 , but on each occasion no prosecution was pursued			0
the magistrate , whose name was also redacted , told the detective during an interview : ' may i offer a personal opinion			1
i sincerely hope that this matter is not prosecuted before the court			0
in my opinion , as a justice of the peace , it is not court worthy			1
' the prosecution can do no good at all and the backlash will have unfortunate repercussions for the police force and the town of @entity42			0
' he added : ' it is no secret that @entity4 and i are buddies and not only politically			2
' the detective , from the @entity83 in @entity84 , wrote : ' those observations were recorded at the time in detective chief inspector ( name redacted ) 's official duty diary			0
the veiled threats and innuendos contained therein reflect ( name redacted ) 's general attitude to this inquiry			0
' sir @entity4 was interviewed by the officer in february 1970 , but refused to answer questions regarding the allegations against him other than through a pre-prepared statement , in which he stated ' most emphatically ' that he had not behaved indecently towards the boys			1
the report suggests that sir @entity4 had a right to carry out medical examinations on them and to administer corporal punishment , and when handing over his statement the politician produced a copy of an agreement , allegedly signed by the young residents , in which they agreed to allow officers of the hostel to exercise ' full parental rights ' over them on all matters , including ' medical and general discipline '			1
@entity32 's chief constable @entity31 ordered the report to be compiled in 1970 the detective wrote that sir @entity4 was ' most unimpressive during my interview with him ' , saying : ' he had difficulty in articulating and even the stock replies he proffered could only be obtained after repeated promptings from his solicitor			1
' were he ever to be placed in a witness box , he would be at the mercy of any competent counsel			0
' the officer concluded : ' it seems impossible to excuse his conduct			0
over a considerable period of time , whilst sheltering beneath a veneer of respectability , he has used his unique position to indulge in a sordid series of indecent episodes with young boys towards whom he had a special responsibility			0
' @entity139 , he appears guilty of numerous offences of indecent assault			0
' in november 2012 @entity142 said sir @entity4 abused young boys in the 1960s in his role as secretary of the @entity146			2
after that announcement the force began looking at fresh claims of abuse at @entity151 , a council - run residential school for vulnerable boys where sir @entity4 served as a governor and which closed in the mid- 1990s , as well as allegations of a cover - up			2
but it was announced last week that inquiries were being halted to allow for a ' wider investigation ' into the alleged corruption			0
in a recently - published book @entity42 's @entity162 mp @entity161 claimed sir @entity4 raped a number of young boys at a residential school			2
police , spies and politicians helped to hide the historical child abuse carried out by the politician , according to mr @entity161 's book , @entity172 : the double life of @entity4			2
the 29 - stone politician was left free to abuse children as young as eight despite 144 complaints by victims , he and co-author @entity174 said			0
during the 1960s , sir @entity4 - when he was a councillor in the town - acted as a governor for several schools and was active on many council committees involving youth activities			2
at least 10 people have so far come forward to say they were abused at @entity151 , of whom seven say they suffered at the hands of sir @entity4			2
sir @entity4 was elected a @entity161 mp in 1972 and became a @entity189 on the formation of the new party before leaving @entity192 in 1992			0
he was knighted in 1988 and died in 2010 .			0
