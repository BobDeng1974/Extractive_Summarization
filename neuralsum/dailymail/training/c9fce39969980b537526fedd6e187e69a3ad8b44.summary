by @entity0 published : 11:53 est , 23 november 2012 updated : 11:53 est , 23 november 2012 a toddler who was violently sick almost every hour of the day for the first 18 months of her life has finally been cured			0
@entity3 , now two , suffered from a rare digestive disorder , which stopped her from digesting her food and caused chronic sickness			1
she slept through the night for the first time since her birth after specialist surgeons opened up an obstruction causing the condition			1
@entity3 , now two , suffered from a rare disorder which stopped her digesting food and caused chronic sickness @entity3 's condition , called duodenal stenosis , is a rare birth defect where a portion of the duodenum ( the first part of the small intestine ) is narrowed			1
this prevents the stomach contents from flowing through at a normal rate			0
it 's not known what causes the condition , although there may be a genetic link			0
fortunately , surgeons at @entity32 , @entity33 , were confident that surgery would resolve the situation			0
and , in a lucky twist of fate , @entity3 would be the first child with her condition to have a procedure that left no scar			1
in the past , duodenal stenosis has been treated by an invasive operation which leaves scarring			0
but rather than making an incision to access the duodenum , surgeons decided they could access it by putting a flexible telescope down @entity3 's throat			2
she slept through the night for the first time ever after specialist surgeons opened up an obstruction causing the condition during the three - hour procedure , they freed up the obstruction in her small intestine , leaving no scar or sign of surgery			1
doctors snipped holes in the membrane covering the first part of her small intestine connecting her stomach to her digestive system using a balloon and electrical knife			0
@entity3 's mother @entity69 , 34 , said : ' she was like a different child after the operation , she recovered straight away and was n’t sick			1
' when she slept through the night for the first time ever i almost cried			1
my body naturally woke me up throughout the night to check on her and when i found her fast asleep it was amazing			0
i was so happy my baby was finally better			0
' now recovered , @entity3 can play with her sister @entity76 and brother @entity77 again mrs @entity3 , who also has five other children , @entity79 17 , @entity80 15 , @entity76 , @entity77 six and @entity81 18 months , continued : ' we are so grateful for the help the surgeons have given not only to @entity3 and me but to my husband and all our children			2
' now @entity3 is living a normal life we have much more time to spend as a family and i can concentrate on all my children equally			1
' mr @entity91 , consultant paediatric surgeon at @entity93 , who performed the operation with colleague dr @entity96 , said : ' i believe this procedure has never been performed on a child with this condition in the @entity100 before due to the rare specialist skills and equipment it requires			1
' i decided the it was possible as my colleague is a rare paediatric endoscopist who has the skills to perform the procedure , and because we possess the specialist equipment needed , including a double channel operating endoscope which cost £ 64,000 , and was funded by @entity111			2
' he added : ' the operation was a complete success , @entity3 was in much less pain and had a quicker recovery			2
if it had been done the regular way it would have left a big scar			0
we do n’t expect her to have any problems later in life			0

@entity3 , now two , suffered from a rare disorder which stopped her digesting food and caused chronic sickness
became the first child in the @entity100 with her condition to have a procedure that left no scar
slept through the night for the first time ever after operation
