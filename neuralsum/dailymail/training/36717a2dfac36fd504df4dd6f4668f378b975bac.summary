@entity8 is bringing the @entity15 series to an end after 20 years , a television series and stage show mr @entity8 wrote his first ‘ history ’ 20 years ago and the books have been so successful , they have been turned into a tv series and even a stage show			1
he said : ‘ it has naturally come to an end , the way things do			0
it has had a good run , it ’s had a better run than most children ’s series			2
' things do have a saturation point after which they become taken for granted			0
it would a shame if that happened			0
’ he added that although nothing certain had been decided between him and his publishers @entity41 , ‘ there is a general feeling there will be no more ’			0
over the past two decades mr @entity8 has tackled everything from the @entity43 to the @entity44 in an effort to make history accessible			1
his output has been prolific and at one point he was writing 14 books a year			1
after more than 60 books in his @entity6 including the @entity51 and @entity52 , the children 's favourite has said he has written the final volume mr @entity8 wrote his first ‘ history ’ 20 years ago and the books have been so successful , they have been turned into a tv series and even a stage show famous for their alliterative titles , the series has been an enormous success ever since the @entity65 and @entity66			1
although @entity8 , 67 , would ' never say never ' to a horrible comeback , he said he wanted the series to be more ' @entity69 than @entity70 '			1

while he said @entity15 had done ' really well ' , he would not miss writing it			0
the very first @entity15 were published in 1993 , and it soon became clear that history books for children would never be the same again			2
unlike their predecessors , the series recognised the appeal for children of all the gruesome , wicked and weird detail from history that writers had hitherto spared them			2

the book writing process for @entity110 , he said , tended to see his publishers call to ask if he knew anything about a period or people from history , for example the @entity116 , the @entity107 reports			0

the @entity15 , and their focus on what is interesting as well as important , had been his ' revenge '			0
despite being taken to the hearts and shelves of a generation of teachers and school librarians , battling to get children to engage with history , he said it was never his intention to be adopted by the @entity146			0

he has written more than 60 horrible histories books in 20 years
