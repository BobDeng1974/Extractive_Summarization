cash - strapped @entity2 could sell the @entity3 to help pay off its vast national debt , the nation 's media has suggested			1
the radical plan to put the world 's best known painting on the market could ' make a dent ' in the country 's crippling £ 1,600billion deficit , state - run news channel @entity2 24 said			1
the @entity13 masterpiece hanging in the @entity14 in @entity15 is seen by up to a million visitors a year			1
smiles better ? cash - strapped @entity2 could sell the @entity3 to help pay off its vast national debt , the nation 's media has suggested the painting is often called ' priceless ' but was valued at £ 60million in 1962 for insurance purposes			1
but with inflation and a further surge in art prices taken into account , the 2014 value of the artwork could now be around £ 1.5billion - or almost one per cent of national debt			1
the @entity2 24 news website wrote : ' her enigmatic smile beams down on hundreds of thousands of tourists a year at the @entity14 in @entity15			1
' and she could also bring a smile to @entity2 's cash - strapped government if a sale could ease the national debt			1
' @entity15 also has another 173 museums brimming with hugely valuable works of art , and a sale of the impressionists at the @entity43 alone would raise an estimated £ 3.5billion , the website said			2
frame game : the @entity3 hangs in the @entity14 in @entity15 and is seen by up to a million visitors a year but selling off national treasures could be against the law because they they are owned by the public , it added			1
@entity2 24 wrote : ' @entity51 - 5 of the @entity53 law governing national treasures stipulates that ' collections held in museums that belong to public bodies are considered public property and can not be otherwise '			2
' even a change in the law would be problematic , as most of @entity2 's cultural heritage has historically come from individual donors , who enjoy significant tax breaks in return for their generosity			2
' they would have to be heavily compensated if their donated works were sold off			0
' but @entity69 's @entity68 said he was against the controversial solution to help rescue @entity2 's floundering economy			1
he said : ' in theory a sale of the @entity3 would raise a very large sum of money			0
but @entity2 is n't yet in such dire economic straits			0
' heavily - indebted @entity77 is doing something similar by putting its state - owned collection of @entity82 paintings up for sale			0
it hopes to recuperate £ 29million - a tiny fraction of its £ 168billion national debt			1
meanwhile , @entity2 has been selling off what it can within the law , including the finest wines from the @entity92 presidential palace cellar , and the @entity93 near the @entity94			0
the latter went to @entity97 and @entity98 buyers who spent 380 million pounds renovating the building to be reopened as the @entity15 hotel , while private wine collectors have been buying up the finest vintages from the presidential cellars			0
there is , however , some light at the end of the tunnel for @entity2 's finances , because the country 's descent down the @entity112 's league of economic strength has been arrested			2
after dropping for four consecutive years , @entity2 is clinging on to the @entity115 spot			0
the report said : ' the [ @entity2 ] government has promised a ' competitiveness shock ' and is considering a number of business - friendly measures , including a simplification of administrative procedures , in order to revive growth and reduce the country 's stubbornly high level of unemployment			2
' it added : ' its infrastructure is still among the best in the world			0
@entity2 also obtains good marks for the quality and quantity of education at all levels , and it boasts a high degree of technological adoption			0
' @entity140 has climbed one spot to @entity142 , the @entity139 is third , while @entity143 takes first place .			0

the @entity3 is said to be ' priceless ' - but could be worth £ 1.5billion
a @entity2 *tv* station has suggested it could be sold to ease the national debt
@entity69 's @entity150 said he was against the solution
