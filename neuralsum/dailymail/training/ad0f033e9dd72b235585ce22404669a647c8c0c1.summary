a council spokesman said : ' the caterpillars are totally harmless to humans , they only feast on the tree but the trees recover quite quickly once the caterpillars pupate and the adults start to fly ' however , we are aware that they have caused the local residents distress and we are investigating what other methods could be used to remove them			2
' councillor @entity126 said : ' unfortunately , owing to the advanced stage of the infestation , i 'm advised by council officers that even if they were to use the treatments they have at their disposal they would have little effect			0
a council spokesman said : ' the caterpillars are totally harmless to humans - they only feast on the tree but the trees recover quite quickly once the caterpillars pupate and the adults start to fly ' the bird - cherry ermine moth is harmless and found across @entity81 as well as many parts of @entity82 huge : the size of some of the caterpillars can be seen in this picture cautious : @entity105 said there were no safe chemicals that could be used in a public area to permanently remove the caterpillars the little critters make themselves at home on some brickwork due to the advanced stage of the infestation , the treatments available to the council would have little effect ' while i appreciate that this is probably of little immediate comfort i get the impression from officers that this is something of a freak occurrence and it is unlikely to recur next year , however i will ask our arboriculture team to monitor this street closely so they can act early in case it does			1
