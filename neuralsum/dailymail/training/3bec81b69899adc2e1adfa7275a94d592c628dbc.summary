by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:51 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 19:25 est , 15 january 2014 @entity5 governor @entity4 last night dismissed proposals to cap bankers ’ bonuses as ‘ crude ’ measures that will fail			1
he said it would simply prompt lenders to push up basic pay as they sought to keep hold of high - flying executives			1
his comments came amid speculation that the @entity18 wants to give senior staff bonuses worth twice their salaries			1
@entity4 : the @entity5 chief says a bonus cap wo n't cut pay packages as it would simply prompt lenders to push up basic pay as they sought to keep hold of high - flying executives and it is an embarrassing blow to @entity28 after @entity29 yesterday called on the government to reject any request to pay higher bonuses at @entity18 – which is still partly taxpayer - owned			1
a new bonus cap introduced this year by @entity34 restricts banks in the @entity36 from paying more than one year ’s salary as a bonus , rising to two times salary if shareholders approve			2
mr @entity4 , who did not mention @entity18 by name , told @entity42 yesterday that he ‘ absolutely ’ agreed that the ‘ crude bonus cap ’ proposal backed by @entity29 was not the best way to rein in excessive pay			1
he said that after making ‘ many mistakes ’ over pay and bonuses in the years leading up to the financial crisis the @entity50 now has now developed a ‘ hard touch ’ approach			2
giving evidence to the treasury select committee , he said capping bonuses would push up basic pay as banks attempted to keep hold of its most highly prized staff			1
the governor said the move would undermine efforts to ensure that large amounts of pay in the form of bonuses were deferred for five years or longer , paid in shares rather than cash , and were able to be clawed back if things went wrong			2
‘ it takes back some of the advantages of the approach that we have had because it will incentivise more cash compensation today – exactly the type of problem we had before – that we ca n’t claw back , ’ mps were told			0
‘ we would rather see more deferral , more equity [ share - based payout ] and this ability to take it back when those risks come to light			0
’ chancellor @entity86 said : ‘ these @entity88 rules will not lead to bankers being paid less			0
‘ what they will lead to is a @entity93 - style situation where you will not be able to get money back off bankers when things go wrong			0
this is precisely what we have been trying to get away from in @entity50			0
’ mr @entity4 ’s comments come after @entity100 told the @entity101 that there will be a £ 2,000 cap on bonuses paid in cash at @entity18 this year , following its introduction in 2013			1
he also said the government would use its position as the bank ’s main shareholder to block any increase in the overall amount paid out in salaries and bonuses			1
but he refused to rule out bonuses worth up to double an executive ’s pay , as long as they are paid in stock and shares designed to deter the short - term risk - taking			1
taxpayers own 80 per cent of @entity18 , meaning the chancellor can prevent this from happening			2
@entity18 has not yet lodged a request for the higher bonus cap			1
it is discussing the matter with investors including @entity129 , the arms - length body set up by the government to manage taxpayers ’ stakes in bailed out banks			0
any request will have to be put to the vote at @entity18 ’s annual meeting with shareholders in @entity139 in may			2
mr @entity100 said : ‘ i can confirm today that just as we have had limits on cash bonuses of £ 2,000 at @entity18 this year and last year , we will do the same next year as well			1
‘ if there are any proposals to increase the overall pay , that is pay and bonus bill at @entity18 , at the investment bank , any proposals for that , we will veto it			1
’ a @entity153 source said the total package of pay and bonuses at @entity18 had halved under the coalition government , from £ 3billion in 2009 to £ 1.4billion in 2012 – although this is partly because its investment banking division is far smaller			1
quarrel : @entity100 refused @entity28 's call to cap individual bank bonuses , but said he would use the government ’s powers to block any rise in the overall pay pot at @entity18 ’s investment arm the source added that given every household had been forced to contribute £ 5,000 to bail out the banking giant , the top priority had to be ensuring they got the money back by returning it to the private sector			1
but @entity174 mp , @entity29 ’s shadow chief secretary to the treasury , criticised the announcements			2
he said : ‘ @entity100 has refused to rule out approving bonuses of up to 200 per cent at @entity18			2
it looks like he and @entity86 would approve such a request at a time when ordinary families face a cost - of - living crisis and bank lending to businesses is falling			0
’ @entity184 , of the trade union @entity185 , said : ‘ the chancellor must not rubber stamp the corporate greed at @entity18			0
if he looks the other way as the top bankers pat each other on the back and fill their boots hard working people across the country will be appalled			0
’ chairman of the @entity197 , @entity198 mp , said there should be no political interference in @entity18			0
‘ @entity18 should be run on commercial grounds			0
were decision - making at @entity18 to be subordinated to political considerations , it would be bad for the bank , bad for the taxpayers ’ stake in the bank and bad for the wider economy , ’ he said			0
‘ the structure and scale of remuneration in banking have incentivised misconduct and excessive risk - taking			0
‘ risk and reward must be much more closely aligned , as the @entity218 recommended			0
‘ the governor of the @entity5 today agreed with the @entity218 ’s conclusion that a crude bonus cap is not the answer ... the structure of remuneration is more important than the absolute level and that more deferral in variable pay is required			0

mr @entity4 said a cap would simply prompt lenders to push up basic pay
speculation @entity18 wants to give staff bonuses worth twice their salaries
@entity29 calls for the @entity236 to block @entity18 from paying staff such huge sums
