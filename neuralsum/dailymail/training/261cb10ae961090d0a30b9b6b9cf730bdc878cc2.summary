by @entity0 published : 12:05 est , 1 october 2012 updated : 07:19 est , 5 october 2012 a woman has become mother to a third set of twins - beating staggering odds of 500,000 to one			1
@entity6 and @entity7 , were born in june last year to their mother @entity8 , 33 , from @entity10 , @entity11			1
the babies have increased her brood to ten , as she also has four other children			1
as a family they get through eight pints of milk and two loaves of bread per day as well as two bulk - size packs of nappies a week			1
but despite her unusually - and unpredictably - large family , @entity8 , who has a pair of identical twin sisters herself , says her home life could not feel more normal			1
triple the trouble : @entity8 holds the latest additions to her brood , @entity6 and @entity7			1
her first twins were @entity29 , far left , and @entity30 , far right , both ten , and @entity31 and @entity32 ( centre ) , both two , are now two			2
' for most families having twins is something out of the ordinary ... [ but for me ] it would almost be weird for me to fall pregnant and not have twins , ' she told the @entity41			0
her story began 10 years ago when she gave birth to @entity30 and @entity29			2
she then split from their father @entity44 before beginning a new relationship with her current fiance @entity47 , 31			0
then in 2010 she learned she was pregnant with more twins - @entity31 and @entity32 , now two			0
and as if that were not enough , she also has children @entity52 , 16 , @entity51 , 13 , @entity53 , 12 , and @entity54 , four			1
' they keep me on my toes , ' she said			0
' some families ca n’t have children , so i see every single one as a blessing			0
' while she said the second pair 's arrival was ' a bit daunting ' , by the time @entity6 and @entity7 were born , she ' knew what [ she ] was doing '			1
but it is not always easy			0
@entity47 is an unemployed furniture maker while , for her , bring up the children is a full time job so it can be a strain to make ends meet			0
' we have to budget very strictly , ' @entity8 added			2
' i try to get everything for about £ 100 a week , but every day i go to the supermarket and spend ­ another £ 15 to top up			2
' and because each of her children is ' unique ' , she says , she refuses to make the youngest wear hand me downs			0
in spite of the pressure to feed and clothe each child separately , @entity8 says she would not want it any other way and believes each one of them will ' have a best friend for life '			2
' and i ’m hoping they ’re all going to look after me when i ’m a pensioner , ' she added .			0

@entity8 beat odds of 500,000 to one when her latest pair , @entity6 and @entity7 , were born in june last year
she now has ten children aged between 16 years and *17* *months*
her family get through eight pints of milk and two loaves of bread per day , two bulk - size packs of nappies in a week
