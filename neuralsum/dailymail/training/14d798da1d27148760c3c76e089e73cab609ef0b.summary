last week i endured of hellish day of work pressures , domestic distractions and a banging headache			2
it reached a crescendo when i served my family a burnt dinner , which my children pulled faces at and pushed around their plates before asking to be excused from the table			2
having finally cleared away the dishes , i knew only a long soak in a frothy bath could offer any hope of respite			2
as i poured bubble bath into the warm water and stripped off my clothes , i breathed deeply and instantly felt more relaxed			2
harsh critic : angela with her daughter @entity20 , ten yet my peace was shattered when my ten - year - old daughter , @entity20 , marched into the bathroom with the unapologetic authority of a conquering army			1
‘ @entity26 , i forgot to tell you i need a packed lunch tomorrow and			0
’ the runaway narrative suddenly screeched to a halt , as she stopped to survey my unclothed form			1
irritated by her unflinching perusal of my birthday suit , i quickly stepped into the bath and slid under the foam			0
but judging by her creased brow and steely glare , my daughter ’s mind had moved beyond thoughts of whether she should have cheese or peanut butter in her sandwiches			1
and though i sensed i was inviting disaster , i could n’t help myself			0
‘ what is it ? ’ i rasped , trying to cap my irritation			0
‘ what are you looking at ? ’ ‘ you , @entity26			0
’ holding my breath , i waited for the killer adjective			0
looked what ? @entity54 ? annoyed ? psychotic ? but it was worse			0
oh , much , much worse			0
‘ @entity26 , but you look so , err , floppy ’ floppy ? floppy ? if ever there was a word a naked woman wants to have expunged from the @entity65 language , then floppy has to be it			1
that is unless we ’re talking sagging sofas or old straw hats			0
certainly , it should be illegal to use as part of a little girl ’s forensic analysis of her mother ’s body — especially when her mother ’s chest is on the larger side			1
but looking down at the pendulous breasts just peeking out from the foamy bubbles , i silently conceded that @entity20 had a point			1
it ’s just that she is the only person brave — and cheeky — enough to vocalise the harsh truth about my mid-life body			1
at that very moment i decided there was only one thing for it ; i would never let my daughter see my naked body again			1
whenever there is discussion about parental nudity , the focus understandably rests on the father / daughter , mother / son dynamic , since it is bound up with a child ’s burgeoning sexuality			1
indeed my husband @entity102 began covering up whenever @entity20 was around about five years ago			1
and by the time @entity20 ’s three brothers , now 21 , 19 and 15 , had reached the age of two , i was always at least partially clothed around them			1
as nature intended : @entity107 thought her nakedness would help @entity20 understand her own development however , with @entity20 things always felt different			1
after all , she was a girl , she was born with the same bits as me			0
my nakedness was , i felt , a natural way for her to come to understand her own physical development			1
it was also a way to counter the many damaging influences young women are subjected to			0
i wanted her to learn that to be beautiful you do not need to be slender to the point of emaciation			0
and i wanted her to understand that nudity is not always sexual			0
so i did n’t mind her seeing me as nature intended			0
she ’d bound into my room in the morning and sit chattering to me while i got dressed , and trail after me into the bathroom when i went to have a shower in the evening , wittering away about her day as i washed			0
for the past few years , we ’ve taken a winter holiday at a lovely hotel on the @entity135			0
the bedroom has a sunken @entity137 on its balcony , and each night , @entity20 and i would fill this expansive tub with lashings of bubbles , strip naked and bathe under the stars , chatting about the day ’s events			1
i felt totally at ease being undressed in front of her , and she never passed comment on my body			2
but in recent months , i ’ve noticed that @entity20 has become more critical in her appraisal of my naked form			1
brutally candid in the way that only children are , she sees , and therefore she comments			0
partly because she is getting older and more aware of her own body			2
and partly because she soaks up the body - conscious , over-sexualised imagery of fashion and pop music like a little sponge			2
not from @entity20 will you ever receive the kindly reassurance that as adults we expect from a close friend			1
instead , she delivers her unvarnished appraisal about the way i look whether i ’ve got clothes on or not			0
only 10 per cent of @entity168 women feel confident naked , according to a recent survey i do n’t mind comments about the colour of my shoes or whether a dress looks ‘ lumpy ’ ( i remind myself this comes from a pint - sized fashionista who thinks a @entity178 ra - ra skirt is the height of couture )			2
however her views on my naked form are much more hurtful			2
why ? because she is vocalising the gloomy thoughts which roll on a loop through the back of my mind about the saggy , blubbery body which has taken the place of my once - lithe physique			2
@entity192 : it 's important to feel comfortable in one 's own skin , says @entity107 in short , the truth hurts			1
do n’t get me wrong			0
@entity20 is never motivated by spite			1
@entity20 is an affectionate little girl , who constantly tells me how much she loves me			1
but being affectionate and honest are not , for @entity20 , diametrically opposed			1
she has yet to learn the art of lying which is perfected by most adult women			0
she is yet to understand that it is almost de rigueur to continually offer false reassurance to fellow females			0
recently i caught her casting a practised eye over my naked body as i squeezed myself into a bikini			1
i heard the sigh of despair through her pursed little lips before she blurted : ‘ @entity26 , please tell me you ’re not going to wear that			0
what did she mean , i demanded ? she fought to articulate her thoughts , saying there was just too much , floppy — that word again ! — flesh on show for someone ‘ of my age ’			1
of course i want my daughter to be able to form and express opinions , but i wish she did n’t have such a knack for putting a verbal knife through my heart			2
yet , there is also redemption			0
too many young girls are vulnerable to body issues			2
especially when one survey recently revealed that a generation of adolescent girls could fail to fulfil their professional potential because they are suffering from low self - esteem about their appearance			2
or that one in four females aged between 11 and 17 are weighed down by pressure to conform to an ‘ ideal notion ’ of how they should look , another survey suggested			0
so what @entity20 ’s candour has allowed me to do is turn this notion on its head , gifting it back in messages about how i do n’t care what she thinks of my body , that it ’s important to feel comfortable in one ’s own skin , and not listen to what others say about appearance			1
and i ’ll keep peddling those messages			0
i just wo n’t let my daughter see me naked before we have such a discussion .			1

when @entity20 saw her mother @entity107 naked , she described her as ' floppy '
@entity107 had always thought her nakedness was a way to show @entity20 how the female body develops
though she continues to tell @entity267 that appearance does *n't* matter , @entity107 vows to never let her daughter see her unclothed again
