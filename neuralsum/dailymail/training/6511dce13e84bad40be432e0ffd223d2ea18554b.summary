buried in the @entity3 jungle in the north of a country that is assailed by preconceptions , @entity1 ’s @entity0 remains a lot like @entity1 itself - unexplored and off - limits for most travellers			1
the thrilling journey to reach these ruins left by the @entity13 civilization could provide a good starting point for a classic @entity17 @entity16 adventure			1
but while it is mainly the long decades of drug - related violence that have kept tourists away from @entity1 , it was a much more romantic turn of events that resulted in this archaeological marvel being largely hidden from the world			1
travellers attempting to reach @entity1 's ' @entity0 ' must make a 15 - mile trek into the @entity3 jungle locally referred to as @entity27 , these intriguing leftovers are believed to have been built around @entity29 - and were only stumbled upon by accident by tropical bird hunters in the early 1970s , five centuries after the @entity33 had fled the area following the @entity36 invasion			1
during the interim , the remains of the city were lost from sight , consumed by the jungle			1
but now , they could be @entity1 's answer to @entity45 - having been painstakingly cleared and opened up to tourists			1
of course , visitors have to get there first - and the gruelling 15 - mile trek is no mean feat. the journey is traditionally offered as a five - day trip			1
my local guide @entity54 looks at me in slight disbelief when i tell him i want to attempt the journey in three			2
take a look : the route into the jungle offers breathtaking views of @entity1 's @entity3 mountain range he has , he informs me , only done this a handful of times before			1
‘ are you sure ? ’ he enquires			2
the reason for his trepidation becomes clear when we set off the next morning			0
within half an hour of our departure , we are briskly negotiating a steep two - mile climb			1
it seems to go on forever			0
eventually , the dusty track which has been carved into the mountainside spits us into dense jungle			1
had this been @entity1 ’s rainy season ( between april and november ) , it would have been virtually impossible to tackle such a treacherous route in such a short amount of time			0
but the forecast on this occasion is dry , the slopes are firm underfoot , and the rivers are low			0
only another seven hours to go today : the route to @entity27 is challenging , particularly during the rainy season between april and november , when the steep slopes become wet and the rivers are high instead , we quickly find that our main obstacle is the stifling jungle heat			1
from now on , all of my belongings seem to be wet			0
a good supply of shirts and quick - drying garments is a must on a trip like this			1
some much needed respite from the sticky humidity comes as we make our first lunch stop			0
we waste no time diving into the icy water behind our camp to cool off underneath the waterfall and the deserted plunge pools of the @entity108			0
usually this would be the place for the first overnight stop			0
but our three - day itinerary means we now pack up and press on , meandering through the forest and past a succession of primitive villages - still inhabited by groups of local @entity118 who work in the forest , dressed in their @entity121 hats and @entity123 boots			1
making a splash : much needed respite from the sticky humidity is offered by plunge pools in the @entity108 steady as he goes : @entity108 are crossed by wading through the water barefoot			0
during the wet season , the rivers can reach waist height and backpackers are often toppled by the strong currents four more hours of steady marching take us to our camp for the evening			2
we arrive just before nightfall			0
it has been a steady seven hours on foot			2
' beds ' for the night , visible in the failing light , will be the hammocks which hang from the rafters of a small wooden cabin by the river ’s edge			0
in the absence of electricity , dinner is prepared over a log fire and eaten by candlelight on long ' banquet ' tables			0
these also accommodate a group of backpackers who are wearily making their return journey from the @entity0			0
those hankering after an old - fashioned adventure will be right at home in this jungle			1
it offers an experience as authentic as it is challenging – although the odd luxury can still be found in the form of fresh grilled fish and a chilled beer at dinnertime			0
humble accommodation : walkers en route to the @entity27 sleep in hammocks slung from shelters welcome fuel : dinner of grilled fish ( and cold beer ) being prepared on a wood - burning stove at the campsite the next morning , we set off at 6am , after watching the sun rise over breakfast			1
i have managed a surprisingly good night ’s sleep in my hammock , with the only interruption coming from the concerto of noise provided by the local wildlife			0
a combination of chirping and humming plays out until dawn - while , during the night , the shrubbery around the campsite is lit up like a christmas tree by the glow of a thousand insects			2
we travel along a clear path - but the rivers that flow across it are barriers that have not , so far , been lowered by the steady increase in tourism to the @entity0			2
every waterway has to be waded across in bare feet , with backpacks held above the head for balance			0
strong currents frequently topple travellers attempting to traverse the rivers waist - deep in the wet season			2
on the up : the final challenge in reaching the @entity0 comes in the form of more than 1,200 stone steps twisting up and disappearing high into the mountainside before finally emerging at the entrance to the site there it is at last : the 1,200 - year - old ruins of the ' @entity0 ' were only re-discovered in the 1970s at one crossing , a rather ramshackle , hand - operated cable car provides meagre assistance			1
the final challenge in reaching our destination comes in the form of more than 1,200 stone steps , which twist up and disappear high into the mountainside - before finally emerging at the entrance to the @entity0			2
it is the same staircase that was stumbled upon by accident in the 1970s , when @entity231 and its stone terraces were re-discovered by local hunters			1
but the sheer effort required to get to this spot has ensured that , for all its beauty , the site remains free of the crowds that are bussed in to @entity240 ’s @entity45 on a daily basis			2
a world of wonder : the trek to @entity231 showcases the best of @entity1 ’s natural beauty and wildlife when we arrive , we have the entire site virtually to ourselves , the only sounds coming from several squawking birds in the distance			1
we are provided with breathtaking views of the horizon , which can change almost by the hour			0
high visibility over the @entity3 mountain range can swiftly turn to rolling mist over the tree - tops			2
although @entity1 has enjoyed an increase in tourism over recent years after slowing shedding its reputation for danger and violence , this reversal in fortune suffered a setback in 2003 when eight foreigners hiking to @entity231 were kidnapped by guerrillas and held for three months			1
on the way back home : @entity271 prepares for the long four - hour drive along the coast to @entity274 it was not until 2005 that the military was sent in , allowing treks to the @entity0 to resume			1
the route is now closely monitored by troops			0
while the trek to @entity231 offers the best of @entity1 ’s natural beauty and wildlife , it is the ' nearby ' city of @entity274 that provides travellers with a taste of the country ’s intoxicating culture			1
a four - hour bus ride west along the @entity291 coast from @entity292 take visitors to this beautiful , medieval walled city			1
@entity295 and new : @entity274 provides travellers to @entity1 with a taste of the country ’s intoxicating culture the old town ’s mix of energetic nightlife and vibrantly coloured streets manages to attract tourists and backpackers , while the city ’s thriving corporate district is abuzz with new investment			0
it may be the @entity0 that provides a glimpse back at @entity1 ’s history			0
but @entity274 is a nod to the future of this stunning @entity314 country			0
