prices have been rising but began to fall from the beginning of 2014 the wholesale price of fuel accounts for around 20 to 25 per cent of a litre of fuel at that price , with a further 57.95p in fuel duty , and vat charged at 20 per cent , added on top			1

shock fall : after spending years mainly above $ 100 a barrel , oil has dived to $ 50 since the end of summer the first case of swine flu had just been found in @entity185 , @entity186 by @entity187 was number one in the charts - and petrol cost less than £ 1 a litre			1
and while it may seem bonkers to believe , especially considering that petrol cost as much as £ 1.40 a litre not long ago , may 2009 was the last time , on average , that petrol was sold at that price - until today			1
while today 's price cut is at just three stations , it could be a sign of good things to come			0

spokesman @entity204 said : ' what ’s currently happening at the pumps with falling fuel prices is something many motorists will not remember seeing before			2
' talk of prices going up like a rocket and falling like a feather could not be further from the truth as retailers have been quick to pass on savings at the forecourt since the @entity200 forecast on december 6 that prices were due to come down by 7p a litre for petrol and 6p for diesel			2
