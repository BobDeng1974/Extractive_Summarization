by @entity0 a house that lacks running water and sits on top of a mountain two kilometres from the nearest road would n't be many people 's idea of a dream place to live but for @entity9 , 69 , it 's paradise			1
the @entity11 - educated son of a former state governor , @entity9 swapped a privileged life in the upper echelons of @entity16 society and a career as an elite fighter pilot for a hand - to - mouth existence in @entity20 in northern @entity16			1
he lives with wife @entity21 in a home that lacks any sort of mod con , including a shower , and sees his children , both of whom moved away , less than once a month			1
remote : former fighter pilot @entity9 ( pictured with @entity28 ) has chosen to live in the wilderness but mr @entity9 says he has no regrets and instead , says his remote 34 - acre estate , @entity32 , is the only place he could imagine living			1
' being what i 've always been , an individualist , i 'm unsuitable ... i ca n't live in an organised society , ' he explains			0
' and it 's not that i 'm evil or bad - i just ca n't live in that sort of nine to five environment			1
and then to have something of your own , to have that freedom ... that 's what i like			2
' @entity9 and his wife @entity21 have lived on the estate for 33 years and had nothing at all when they first arrived			1
over years , the couple built themselves a home on the site of what used to be cowsheds and live on just Â £ 3,000 a year - money they raise through farming and by renting out a pair of small cottages to passing hikers			1
mountainous : @entity9 's home is 6,500ft above sea level and is two kilometres from the nearest road basic : the couple 's home , which they built themselves , has no running water and cooking is done outside one such visitor is @entity28 , who spends a week with mr @entity9 and his family as part of his new series , @entity77 in the @entity78			1
' you ca n't open the fridge and get out a bottle of milk , ' he observes of mr @entity9 's unusual set - up			1
' you have to come down here and milk the cow or , in this case , a buffalo			0
' although the house now has electricity , there is no running water , no internet and no central heating - not pleasant when the temperature dips below zero as it regularly does in winter			1
nevertheless , mr @entity9 , whose hobbies include spending time alone naked in the wild ( ' the feeling of wearing no clothes is very liberating to me ! ' ) and refurbishing old motorbikes , says that the tough daily slog is well worth it			1
that slog begins at dawn when the couple get up to milk their seven cows before knuckling down to farm work			0
@entity110 : @entity9 and @entity21 's home is so remote , getting to the nearest major city takes nine hours fun times : when he 's not farming , @entity9 is indulging in his other passion - restoring old motorbikes mr @entity9 also conducts regular patrols around the estate , much of which is forested , in a bid to keep wood - pinching locals from the nearest village at bay			1
it 's a far cry from his early life , spent in luxury with his affluent parents , and his fighter pilot career , which saw him take to the skies in @entity129 and @entity130 21 jets and fight in two wars			1
but in 1974 , @entity133 , who had already been subjected to three court martials for refusing to accept orders , was kicked out of the air force for good - much to the horror of his father			2
' my father was horrified because he was a pretty conservative sort of chap , ' he explains , his @entity144 still retaining traces of his very @entity147 education			0
' but i said to him , " @entity149 , you took a lot of bullsh * * when you were part of the @entity152 but i speak out which is slightly different from you			0
" so he was able to keep his mouth shut - i could not			2
' and then i met this exceptional woman , @entity21 , ' he continues			2
' she 's a woman without any education , this , that and the other but there was something inborn in her so we fell in love			2
' and i told my father and my father said : " oh dear , this is not on dammit ! " i said " @entity149 , what 's the problem ? you should be a better @entity168 ! " and then i left			0
' i took my guns and put them over my shoulder , i met her father down below and said " give us your blessings , we 're off ! " and that was it			0
' but it was n't long before @entity9 's father , worried about the fate of the family 's @entity32 estate , got back in touch			1
' then the shit hit the fan and they said " son ! can you come here ? " [ to @entity32 ] and like a good son , i came			0
' more than 30 years later , @entity133 is still there and still farming despite having to deal with challenges such as arthritis and the depredations of local leopards			0
threat : @entity9 says that four or five leopards live close to his mountain eyrie as well as parrots and monkeys happy : @entity9 and his wife @entity21 have no plans to change their home , despite advancing old age ' there are around four to five around here in this area , ' he reveals			1
' there are many incidences of leopards catching children , catching women , catching men ... ' his two children , @entity212 and @entity213 , were brought up on the estate themselves , although educated in @entity215 at the behest of his parents			0
while @entity9 is bullish about most aspects of life in the wilderness , he does admit that there were moments when he worried about what might happen to them			2
' in reality , there were moments with a lot of self - doubt and uncertainty , ' he says			0
' my main worries were the education and the sort of society they would grow up in			0
' with both now in their 30s , @entity133 's latest worry is what will happen to the estate after he 's gone so to make life easier for his children , he 's taken preparations in hand - including digging his own grave			2
' would be bloody funny if i kicked the bucket now , ' he quips as he shows @entity28 the waiting tomb			0
' welcome to my grave ! this was dug many , many years ago , ' he adds			0
' i said : " let 's be prepared for these things " ! ' satisfied with life : @entity9 says his only regret is not flying his fighter plane over the farm with his grave complete , he says his only worry left is whether his two children will be able to keep the estate intact after his death			1
' in this day and age with things all around us , slowly breaking up , you know law and order and things like that , that 's my only worry			0
' how are they going to look after this with people trying to make inroads and things like this ? ' despite the challenges of life on a mountaintop and the uncertainty about what will happen after he 's gone , @entity9 says he 's missed out on nothing			1
' the only regret i have is that i never flew my fighter plane over my own farm , ' he chuckles			0
' i 've flown the length and breadth of @entity16 but never here			2
that 's my only regret			0
' @entity28 : new @entity286 , tonight at 9pm on @entity287			0
