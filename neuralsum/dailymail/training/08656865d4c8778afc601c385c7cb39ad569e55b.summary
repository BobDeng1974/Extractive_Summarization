that 's not cricket , @entity1 @entity2 may come to regret admitting that she did not know of cricket legend @entity3 - who watched her third - round match from the @entity5 last saturday - with unhappy @entity6 bombarding her @entity8 page with angry messages			1
it also resulted in the hashtag # whoismariasharapova trending worldwide on @entity12			0
interestingly , @entity3 ’s @entity8 page has almost six and a half million more likes with 20.2m to @entity2 ’s 13.7m			2
what have i done ? @entity2 may come to regret not knowing who @entity3 is @entity19 bares all @entity20 may have lost in the third round here this year but the eccentric @entity22 is still causing quite a stir after posing naked for the august issue of @entity25			1
it is all for a good cause , though , with the centrefold shoot - which shows off a grumpy dwarf tattoo on his right hip - raising awareness for @entity32			2
@entity20 is currently dating fellow @entity22 player @entity33 - the ex-girlfriend of former world no 1 @entity35			1
the naked truth : @entity20 bares all for charity frustration : @entity20 bites his racket during a game @entity40 ? one of the most popular spots for photographs at the @entity43 is the plaque on the wall by @entity46 that commemorates the longest tennis match in history between @entity49 and @entity50 in 2010			1
yet it was somewhat surprising to spot @entity52 - who lost 70 - 68 in a fifth set lasting eight hours and 15 minutes - stroll alone through the large @entity55 crowds relatively unnoticed			2
forgotten man : @entity50 in action during his first round match against @entity59 of @entity60 @entity61 splits from coach @entity63 2 @entity61 suffered a disappointing exit in the third round last week and has now split with her coach of two years , @entity66			1
the @entity68 32 - year - old is considered to have played her best tennis under the guidance of @entity66 - winning her second @entity72 title at the @entity73 this year - but the 50 - year - old @entity74 has ended the relationship to spend more time at his academy in @entity78			0
heading for the exit : @entity61 shakes hands with @entity80 after their third round match at @entity55 @entity82 's calling the shots since retiring from the sport after her first - round defeat here last year , @entity85 ’s @entity84 has forged a successful post-tennis career as a commentator and pundit			1
thursday marked the first occasion she had worked on the same match as her umpire brother @entity93 when she called @entity94 and @entity96 ’s victory over @entity97 and @entity98			0
she tweeted : ‘ commentating on a match with my brother in the chair for the first time			0
’ charity : @entity84 takes part in an exhibition match at @entity106 to honour the late @entity107 @entity108 flies the flag the gloom at @entity111 following @entity113 ’s quarter - final exit was lifted somewhat by big - serving @entity114 yesterday , as the 18 - year - old from @entity116 progressed to the boys ’ singles quarter - finals by beating @entity120 @entity119 6 - 1 , 6 - 3			0
@entity114 is the sole @entity121 remaining in the junior events after three girls , @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 , were knocked out in quick succession .			0

*richest* *female* *athlete* admitted having no idea who @entity3 is
@entity20 *whipped* his gear off for a nude *photoshoot* with @entity25
@entity50 was left *wondering* was his *138* - game fifth set really worth it
@entity61 *decided* enough was enough as she split with her coach
