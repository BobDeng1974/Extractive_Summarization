by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:36 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 11:23 est , 28 november 2013 cigarettes will be sold in plain packaging by may 2015 following an astonishing double u-turn by @entity5			1
ministers today battled to insist they were not ' playing catch - up ' as @entity8 claimed the government had only acted after being faced with the prospect of a major defeat in the @entity12			1
now new laws are to be rushed forward so that a ban on branded packets can be introduced before the next general election , ahead of a review of the evidence from @entity19 , the first country to impose plain packaging			1
amid a sense of chaos , @entity32 over-ruled the @entity35 to insist the plans would not go ahead			0
it prompted @entity8 leader @entity38 to accuse mr @entity5 of being the ' prime minister for @entity40 and @entity41 '			0
campaigners believe plain packaging will make cigarettes less attractive to smokers , particularly the young			1
ministers are to rush through laws giving power to copy @entity19 where cigarette packets like these show no branding and the shocking effects of smoking they were backed by then - health minister @entity55 who admitted ‘ gorgeous ’ cigarette packets persuaded her to take up smoking as a ‘ symbol of glamour ’			1
and one study in @entity19 found that those buying cigarettes in unbranded brown packets were 81 per cent more likely to consider quitting			1
now the government has asked paediatrician sir @entity66 to carry out a review of the evidence , which will be completed by march			1
the move is also designed to defuse a toxic row about the influence of mr @entity5 ’s controversial strategy chief @entity72			0
the prime minister was dogged by questions about lobbying when he blocked plans by health secretary @entity77 for a ban in july – because mr @entity72 ’s firm works for tobacco giant @entity80			0
@entity5 ( left ) had been accused of bowing to pressure from strategist @entity72 ( right ) to block the plain packaging laws , something @entity84 denies @entity86 today admitted he had broken another promise : he has not given up smoking			1
two years ago he announced he had given up his ‘ evening fags ’ because he wanted to be able to out - run his three sons when they are teenagers			0
but challenged over his pledge as the government announced plans for plain cigarette packaging , mr @entity86 admitted he had suffered a lapse			1
‘ i ’m trying to be a little less categorical			0
i do lapse from time to time , but my smoking habit is much , much more under control than it ever was			1
‘ i do n’t every day , it ’s much , much less			0
but , what i ’m not going to pretend is that i will never ever smoke a cigarette again in my life , because i suspect i might well			1
’ he said he started smoking in his early teens , but suggested peer pressure played a bigger part than packaging			1
he added : ‘ my memory is actually that it was so much to do with peer pressure , it was all the boys and girls in my year were smoking , and just holding out from that			2
‘ now , what the evidence does appear to suggest is that one of the things that drives … it ’s not the only thing , but one of the things that drives , is the kind of glamour with which cigarette packages are presented and marketed			1
‘ if the evidence shows as the emerging evidence appears to show that this would make a difference , then we as a government of course will take that step			1
’ his about - turn came shortly after it emerged mr @entity72 had told him to ‘ get the barnacles off the boat ’ – a reference to dumping controversial policies ahead of the election			0
mr @entity5 denied being lobbied directly by his elections adviser but refused to say whether the two men had discussed the issue			0
public health minister @entity142 said accused @entity8 of being ' rather miserable ' for suggesting that the @entity143 was merely trying to avoid a defeat in the @entity12 , where a vote on the issue is due shortly			0
she told @entity148 's today programme : ' people do feel strongly , and quite rightly , this is fundamentally about children 's health			0
' we know that two - thirds of people start smoking when they are children			2
' it is quite a complex area of policy and we know from the @entity19 experience that it is quite controversial			1
it is a quick review , we 've asked sir @entity66 to report by march , to have a look , to take that independent view , to step back from the politics of this and to survey the evidence for us			1
' i think that is a sensible next step in making policy in this area			0
' but @entity8 's shadow health secretary @entity173 said : ' if the government were serious it would be taking action now to cut the harm from tobacco to children			2
' instead , we ’ve got another review and why have we got this announcement now ? ' it ’s because the government was on the verge of losing a vote in the @entity12 in the next couple of weeks			1
' so , i do n’t believe this is a serious move that they ’ve now converted to the cause and i ’m afraid it ’s just a tactic to avoid humiliation in the @entity12			0
' health campaigners had urged the government to follow @entity19 which this year became the only country to adopt plain packaging , all cigarette packs are drab green			1
research suggests non-smokers and young people find less appealing			0
a government source said the move to ban branded packets would put a stop to claims from the opposition about mr @entity5 being in hoc to the tobacco lobby : ‘ this will nail @entity8 ’s ridiculous smears			1
now the pressure will be on @entity8 to get behind this amendment to enable the introduction of standardised packaging			0
’ but health sources insisted that months of internal wrangling and continued pressure from campaigners , also played a part in the decision			0
in july , ministers said they were shelving the proposed ban because of insufficient evidence that it would work			2
there were also fears that the government will become embroiled in a long and costly legal dispute with the tobacco industry , which argues that a ban would be illegal			2
a ban is also opposed by many @entity227 , who view it as nanny state interference			0
a health source last night said : ‘ we always said we would look at the emerging evidence and this is the earliest opportunity to do it			2
’ cigarettes have already been banned from being displayed on view in shops , and are instead sold under the counter smoking causes over 100,000 deaths every year in the @entity23 and the @entity241 think tank has estimated it costs society £ 14billion			2
despite a huge reduction in the numbers since the 1950s , it is estimated that one in five @entity23 still smoke			0
the move was welcomed by health campaigners today			0
dr @entity249 , chief executive of @entity252 , said : ' stopping cigarettes being marketed to children as a glamorous and desirable accessory is one of the greatest gifts we can give the next generation			2
' if this becomes law next year there is no question that it will save thousands of lives in the future			2
' @entity265 , chief executive of the @entity266 , said : ' this is an early @entity268 present for all of the campaigners that have been working tirelessly to save young lives			0
' but @entity272 , director general of the @entity273 , said : ' this could potentially be a very disappointing u-turn by the government			1
' plain packaging will have a negligible impact on health , will boost the black market , and do enormous harm to small businesses			2
' in the words of @entity5 , let 's treat adults like adults and give them more responsibility over their own lives			0
