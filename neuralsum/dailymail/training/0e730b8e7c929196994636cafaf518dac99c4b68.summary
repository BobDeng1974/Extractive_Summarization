by @entity0 published : 07:38 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 07:38 est , 25 october 2013 @entity1 has voted to allow the mining of uranium , other radioactive materials , and rare earth metals			1
the decision is sure to attract interest from @entity8 which currently exports 90 per cent of the world 's ' rare earths ' ( file picture ) @entity1 's parliament has lifted a ban on mining radioactive materials including uranium in the hope that it will raise funds for the nation 's stagnant economy			1
the new law will also allow the mining of ' rare earths ' , uncommon materials used in many modern technologies such as smartphones and hybrid cars			0
the move is sure to attract the attention of @entity8 which currently produces around 90 per cent of the world 's rare earth metals			1
investors from @entity33 - owned @entity32 think they may have found one rare earth deposit which could be the largest outside of @entity8 , and has estimated it could extract up to 40,000 tons of metals per year			2
quoted by local newspaper @entity37 , @entity1 prime minister @entity38 said : ' we can not live with unemployment and cost of living increases while our economy is at a standstill			0
' it is therefore necessary that we eliminate zero tolerance towards uranium now			0
' @entity38 's government won the vote by 15 - 14 votes and now hope that mining income can be used to win financial independence			0
while @entity1 is self - governing the island is still officially part of the @entity54 on @entity55 , and rely on their old colonial masters for a cash subsidy which makes up two - thirds of the island 's economy			1
one @entity33 - owned firm says it is exploring a rare earth deposit which could be the largest ever found outside of @entity8 ( file picture ) the former colonial ruler also has a say in security and defence issues and any decision to sell uranium may need to be approved by the @entity55 parliament - possibly putting the two nations on a diplomatic collision course			1
@entity55 's minister for trade and @entity75 affairs , @entity76 , said : ' concrete actions on the mining and export of uranium will potentially have far - reaching implications for foreign , defence and security policies and are as such a matter for the @entity54			2
' @entity1 's ' zero tolerance ' policy on mining radioactive materials is inherited from @entity55 , but the island is keen to develop mining to help pay for welfare and jobs in this country with a population of around 57,000 people , mostly @entity94			1
since @entity1 won self - government in 2009 , most politicians have aimed for growing autonomy and eventual independence			0
environmental campaigners have warned that mining in @entity1 could upset the pristine @entity102 ecosystem ' i think the @entity55 government is prepared for the no - tolerance to be lifted ' said @entity106 , senior researcher at @entity107			1
' after that the @entity1 and the @entity55 are going to start hammering all the legal aspects			2
we will not be mining on friday , nor next year , or 2015			0
' however , the possibility of uranium mining has been criticised by environmental groups which warn that uranium mining in @entity1 could threaten the @entity102 's pristine ecological system			2
separately , iron ore producer @entity115 said on thursday it had received the go - ahead from the @entity1 government for a 15 million tonne a year mine in the country , paving the way to attract partners for the project			0
the @entity125 project which will cost an estimated Â£ 1.4billion ( $ 2.3 billion ) has been controversial in @entity1 over fears that it will attract a flood of @entity8 workers into the country .			0
