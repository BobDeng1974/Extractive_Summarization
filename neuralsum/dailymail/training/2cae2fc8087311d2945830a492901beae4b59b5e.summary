by @entity0 published : 12:08 est , 18 august 2013 updated : 05:51 est , 19 august 2013 protesters at a potential fracking site boasted last night that police could do nothing to prevent them blocking all future attempts to drill for shale gas			1
more than 1,000 hard - core activists took part in a day of action in @entity10 , @entity11 , yesterday and promised more demonstrations to stop other exploratory drilling by energy firms			1
the campaigners ’ defiance comes after the police were accused of giving into mob - rule last week when energy company @entity19 announced it would be scaling down its work at the site			1
as a result , @entity19 temporarily ‘ scaled back ’ its operations			1
the decision raised fears that – irrespective of the rights and wrongs of fracking – the rule of law was being flouted			2
now environmental activists say that , despite security patrols around the drilling site and a barbed wire fence , they are confident they can end the drilling altogether			0
veteran campaigners from @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 joined a 1,200 - strong camp set up in a nearby field yesterday , marching from @entity10 railway station to the drilling site			1
police advised @entity19 to close the site after hundreds of people joined protests			1
@entity67 , today 's demonstration @entity69 said so far it has spent £ 750,000 policing the protests and is seeking help from the @entity72 a protester sits in front of the police line during continued demonstrations today environmental activists parade through @entity10 after organisers pledged direct action tomorrow police presence was stepped up to cope with the influx , with officers from at least ten other forces joining their @entity85 colleagues			1
total policing costs so far are said to be approaching £ 2million			1
protester @entity87 , 19 , was helping co-ordinate the action against the police with a walkie - talkie			1
describing himself as a ‘ professional protester ’ he said it was the 14th demonstration he had funded through claiming benefits			0
he added : ‘ we ’re winning as they ’ve already halted the drilling and we can stick it out here until it ’s removed altogether			0
‘ the police ca n’t handle us and do n’t want to deal with it			2
this is a waste of the police ’s money and their time			2
' they ca n’t win as we outnumber them and it ’s too large a space to contain			0
‘ they ’re scared and i think they have got officers in from other parts of the country as the @entity85 ones got on with us			0
’ protests ( pictured today ) have attracted support from @entity119 politicians and celebrities such as @entity121 one protester wears a police hat as they march through the @entity11 village grandmother @entity126 , a 55 - year - old a business consultant from @entity127 , @entity128 , has been camping outside @entity10 for two weeks			1
she said : ‘ the police ca n’t patrol it all the time and security will be lax around the drill			2
‘ there ’s more of us than them			0
we will not be stopped			0
’ fracking pumps liquid at high pressure deep underground to split shale rock and release gas to be used as fuel			2
although there are no immediate plans to use fracking at the site , the controversial technique could be deployed if fuel reserves are found			2
until now , police have enabled workers to continue drilling			0
but fears that hundreds more demonstrators could arrive this month prompted a re-think			0
protest organisers said they have forned a human chain around the @entity19 site former @entity158 leader @entity157 stands outside the main entrance to the @entity19 site officers from 10 counties have been drafted in to support @entity69 with the protests more than 45 arrests have been made since the protests began near @entity10 three weeks ago and more than 30 people have been charged			1
the campaigners say they fear fracking will cause contamination of local water supplies and could cause localised earthquakes			0
but @entity171 has insisted the whole country should accept fracking , claiming it will attract ‘ real public support ’ when the benefits , such as potentially cutting energy bills , are explained			0
the prime minister has argued that the process would not damage the countryside and cause only ‘ very minor change to the landscape ’ .			0

about 800 people gathered at @entity27 camp in @entity10
protesters promise days of ' direct action ' against company @entity19
@entity19 *chairman* says fracking is in ' national purpose '
*sussex* police say policing protests has cost £ 750,000 so far
