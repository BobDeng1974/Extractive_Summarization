but doctors were not alerted for two more hours , by which time she was suffering cardiac arrest and struggling to breathe			2
@entity6 , 77 , died of a bowel infection after staff at @entity15 failed to check on her for 12 hours meaning they did not realised she had become critically ill despite undergoing emergency surgery at @entity20 in @entity21 - under - @entity17 , @entity18 , mrs @entity6 died three weeks later			1
an inquest in @entity23 also heard that records about observations that should have been made on her had been destroyed			0
in what her family said was her first time in hospital , mrs @entity6 was admitted in december 8 last year and after seven hours in @entity31 was placed on a ward with 19 other patients			1
however , because of staff shortages , one of the two nurses was replaced by a healthcare assistant with no medical training			0
between 6pm and 6am , no observations were made on her and mrs @entity6 ’s family fear her blindness meant she could not have found the buzzer to raise the alarm			1
an on - call doctor did not visit her despite an earlier request for blood tests and x-ray results to be reviewed overnight			1
the record of this request has been destroyed and the inquest heard conflicting accounts from doctors over whether they knew she was on the surgical ward			0
a nurse examined her at 6am , but the results were initially wrongly interpreted and her condition was not flagged up to doctors until 8am			1
just one qualified nurse was left to look after 20 seriously ill patients on @entity15 's surgical unit the night @entity6 , 77 , was admitted , an inquest was told it is believed that she lost consciousness during the night and by the time a doctor saw her she was going into cardiac arrest and struggling to breathe because of a bowel infection caused by gallstones			1

had she lived she would have celebrated her diamond wedding anniversary with her husband @entity84 this year			0
he said : ‘ the @entity86 let @entity6 down terribly – the way they treated her is absolutely disgusting			2
‘ this should have been a very happy year for us – it was my 80th birthday , and we were going to @entity91 for our 60th wedding anniversary			0
instead , we ’ve been fighting for answers about why she never came out of hospital			2
’ an internal investigation at the hospital found a healthcare assistant unfamiliar with the surgical unit had been drafted in to replace a nurse when the ward was short - staffed mrs @entity6 ’s daughter , @entity101 , 58 , said : ‘ i feel that in those 12 hours my mum could have been saved			1
’ her son @entity103 , 56 , added : ‘ i know they were rushed off their feet that night but to have one nurse looking after 20 people is disgusting			0
’ mrs @entity6 ’s treatment is the latest case of scandalous treatment of pensioners in some parts of the @entity86 revealed by the @entity114 ’s dignity for the @entity116 campaign			2
in july , @entity20 was one of 11 placed in special measures over failures that included overnight staffing ratios			0

last night , a spokesman for the trust said it now aimed to provide one nurse to every eight patients on all wards but could not guarantee that healthcare assistants would not fill in again			0
the trust denied records about mrs @entity6 ’s care had been destroyed deliberately			2
@entity137 , director of nursing , said : ‘ the trust extends its sincere condolences to mr @entity140 and his family at this difficult time			0
