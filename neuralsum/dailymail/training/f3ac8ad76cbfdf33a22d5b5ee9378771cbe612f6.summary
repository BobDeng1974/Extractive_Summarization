by @entity0 the man who eliminated post-sandwich guilt with a bread made almost entirely out of broccoli has added a pizza to his collection of healthy carbs			1
@entity8 , a @entity11 - based @entity10 banker - turned - baker who launched @entity12 - a sandwich delivery business that provides a virtually carb - free , low calorie super-bread made from broccoli - has expanded his range			1
@entity8 , who was made redundant from his job as a trader at @entity18 two years ago , said it took hundreds of prototypes and samples before perfecting his broccoli pizza recipe			1
is this the world 's healthiest pizza ? a banker - turned - baker has created broccoli pizza , which has 50 per cent fewer calories and 90 per cent fewer carbs than other ' healthy ' pizzas using all - natural produce and broccoli as the main ingredient , the result is , according to independent assessments , by some distance the lowest - calorie , lowest - carb pizza available in the @entity37			1
@entity39 ’s special gluten - free recipe has 50 per cent fewer calories and 90 per cent fewer carbs than the average ' healthy ' pizzas on the market			1
as a comparison , 100g of popular thin and crispy pizzas have , on average , 260 calories and 29g carbohydrate while 100g of the broccoli pizza has 125 calories and 2g of carbohydrate			1
speaking about his latest foodie creation , which is available with chicken , salami and mozzarella toppings , @entity8 said : ' we were really proud of the broccoli bread product that was launched last year , but were unsure of how many people would embrace the concept			1
tinge of green : using all natural produce and broccoli as the main ingredient , the result is , by some distance the lowest calorie , lowest carb pizza available in the @entity37 ' lots of people signed up immediately for our lunchtime sandwich delivery service , which has now grown to incorporate clients such as @entity70 and the @entity71			1
it showed us that there must be an unfulfilled desire for people to seek healthy options to what are , on the whole , not the healthiest products			0
' the pizza was the next clear opponent			0
the trials have gone very promisingly and we are thrilled to launch the broccoli pizza product			1
' despite having no experience in oven - based work , the 28 - year - old set himself the challenge of creating the world 's healthiest bread			2
he spent hours poring over books in the @entity91 , studying the latest medical research on how food is stored as fat , and meticulously devised more than 150 prototypes before arriving at @entity39 's secret recipe			0
a dieter 's dream : using all natural produce and broccoli as the main ingredient , @entity8 created the lowest carb bread in the @entity37 banker turned baker : despite having no baking experience , former banker @entity8 taught himself how to make the lowest carb bread in the @entity37 ' when we were devising the original bread recipe we were adamant on all the ingredients being gluten - free , ' he explained			1
' this was an effort to make the bread accessible to more people			2
however , we have been contacted by masses of people who are looking for gluten - free solutions to baked goods that are on the market at present			0
' the scale of the need for coeliac appropriate products seems to far outstrip both the availability and quality of what is currently on offer			0
we ’re hoping , in our own small way , to help increase the choice for what seems to be a vastly underestimated and underrepresented party of eaters			0
' in the long term , we ’d love to tackle as many flour based products as possible and give our healthy interpretation of them			0
we already have a broccoli flour scotch egg , but perhaps a range of pies or other savoury items			0
' @entity39 delivers platters , individual sandwiches , pizzas and healthy snacks to addresses across @entity11 as well as stocking shops , gyms and canteens			2
@entity0 says : ' if there was one food i had to eat forever it would be bread , followed closely by pizza			0
' so when i found out about @entity12 , i was more than excited at the prospect of actually being able to do " carbs before marbs "			2
' it 's a cross between an omelette , eggy bread and brioche			0
on first tasting it , i was n't convinced , but with more bites , the pizza tasted really good and with the right toppings , tastes very close to the real thing - without the guilt			0
' i 'm , controversially , not a fan of a good old greasy @entity167 's so this is the perfect guilty fix for dieters who are partial to committing the occasional carbicide			0
' @entity171 , @entity172 's resident foodie , says : ' whenever i am convinced to choke back a health food of any sort i am always a little dubious , particularly when it is a piece of pizza with less than 200 calories , absolutely no carbs and that counts towards one of your five - a - day			2
' the broccoli - based pizza is not exactly like taking a bite out of deep - pan @entity184 but it is tasty			2
@entity188 toast - like in texture , it is light and spongy and there is definitely a hint of broccoli to the flavour ( or perhaps that 's just me overthinking the green base ? ) ' most importantly , there is cheese , real cheese , and tomato sauce - and in my books if you can eat pizza with cheese on a diet you 're on to a winner			2
' mail on sunday features writer @entity206 , who sampled the broccoli scotch egg , says : ' the scotch egg actually went down a treat with everyone here			0
' it tastes way better than it looks and smells and everyone was thrilled at the thought of a low - calorie scotch egg			1
we ’re wondering whether there ’s a low - calorie sausage roll to go with it ? '			1
