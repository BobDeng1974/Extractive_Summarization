by @entity0 published : 12:56 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 20:40 est , 10 december 2012 free speech : @entity2 , the director of public prosecutions , said there is no need for a law that makes it a crime to insult someone there is no need for a law that makes it a crime to insult someone , the @entity2 has said			1
in a boost to free - speech campaigners , @entity2 said it was safe to reform the controversial law that says it is a criminal offence to use ‘ insulting words or behaviour ’			1
the clause of the 26 - year - old @entity19 has spurred a campaign which has united gay and secular activists , celebrities and conservative @entity25 evangelicals in favour of a robust right for people to insult each other			1
in october , comedian @entity30 said the law was having a ‘ chilling effect on free expression and free protest ’			2
he warned : ‘ the clear problem of the outlawing of insult is that too many things can be interpreted as such			2
criticism , ridicule , sarcasm , merely stating an alternative point of view to the orthodoxy , can be interpreted as insult			2
’ the @entity45 , which mr @entity46 heads , has in the past been against any move to strike the word ‘ insulting ’ from the statute book			0
but the @entity2 has now changed his mind , the @entity45 said			1
he wrote in a letter to former @entity54 chief constable lord dear : ‘ having now considered the case law in greater depth , we are unable to identify a case in which the alleged behaviour leading to conviction could not properly be characterised as “ abusive ” as well as “ insulting ”			1
‘ i therefore agree the word “ insulting ” could safely be removed without the risk of undermining the ability of the @entity45 to bring prosecutions			0
’ however , mr @entity46 added : ‘ i also appreciate there are other policy considerations involved			0
’ the indication from the @entity45 that the law against insult does nothing to protect the public came as a major boost for the campaign to amend the 1986 @entity19			1
warning : comedian @entity30 ( right ) said the law was having a ' chilling effect on free expression and free protest ' while gay rights campaigner @entity79 ( left ) said that ' the longer insults are criminalised , the more people will risk losing their right to freedom of speech ' the law was notoriously used in 2005 when an @entity85 student was arrested for saying to a police officer : ‘ excuse me , do you realise your horse is gay ? ’ it has also been used to arrest a @entity25 preacher in @entity91 who told a passer - by that he thought homosexuality was sinful			1
and teenager @entity93 was fined £ 50 in 2007 for ‘ causing distress ’ to a pair of labradors by saying ‘ woof woof ’ at them within earshot of the police			0
the case was later quashed on appeal			0
@entity103 of the @entity105 think - tank said : ‘ we hope home secretary @entity107 will listen to the country ’s top prosecutor and agree to reform this overboard and unwanted legislation			0
’ gay rights campaigner @entity79 said : ‘ this legislation has been on the statue books for 26 years , initially to control football hooligans , major demonstrations and protests such as the miners ’ dispute			0
‘ but the legislation is now being used to criminalise huge numbers of people for trivial comments			0
‘ in 2009 the police used this law 18,000 times , including against people who were expressing their views or beliefs in a reasonable manner			2

@entity2 said it was safe to reform the controversial law that says it is a criminal offence to use ' insulting words or behaviour '
