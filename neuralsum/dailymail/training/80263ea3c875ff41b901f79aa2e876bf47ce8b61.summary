by @entity0 from the building of vast pyramids to religious life and burial practices , life in ancient @entity2 was very different to our own			1
but modern vegetarians may have more in common than they thought with the ancient @entity2 , because it is thought that they also ate a diet composed largely of vegetables , fruit , wheat and barley			1
archaeologists have thought for a while that most settled ancient populations survived on a vegetarian diet and now carbon isotope analysis has given experts a better idea than ever before of what the ancient @entity2 ate			1
a team of researchers studied carbon atoms in 45 mummies that lived in @entity2 between @entity27 and @entity28 to discover that they ate a lot of barley and wheat over the long period , suggesting that they adapted to the region incredibly well , as evidenced by farming scenes painted on the walls of tombs ( pictured ) a team of researchers from the @entity40 studied carbon atoms in 45 mummies that lived in @entity2 between @entity27 and @entity28			1
they found that all the mummies ate a lot of barley and wheat , indicating that the @entity2 were skilled farmers			2
the ancient people ate mostly ' @entity48 ' plants such as garlic , aubergines , pears , lentils and wheat , but less than 10 per cent of their diet was made up of @entity55 seeds such as millet and sorghum			1
they ate remarkably little fish , according to the study			0
this has surprised some experts because archaeological evidence has proved otherwise and there are a lot of paintings in tombs showing people fishing with nets and poles			0

the finding also echoes many paintings in @entity2 tombs that show people working the land and harvesting wheat to make loaves of bread , which are often offered to god of the afterlife , @entity92			2
carbon atoms are taken in by plants from carbon dioxide in the process of photosynthesis and carbon ends up in human bodies by eating the plants or by eating animals that eat the plants , @entity93 reported			2
scientists can investigate a person ’s diet by studying the isotopes @entity107 and carbon - 13 , which have slightly different masses			0
keen fishermen ? surprisingly the study revealed that the mummies had not eaten much fish in their lifetime			2
it has previously been assumed that the ancient @entity2 ate fish , which they caught in the @entity118 , as seen in paintings in tombs			1
a relief showing net fishing is pictured plants are divided into two groups : @entity48 , which includes garlic , aubergines , pears , lentils and wheat and @entity55 , which comprises millet and sorghum , which are seedy grasses			0
@entity48 plants take in less carbon - 13 than the @entity135 so researchers can work out what people ate by measuring the ratio of the two isotopes			2
if a person ate a lot of @entity48 plants , the concentration of carbon - 13 isotopes in their body will be lower than if they mainly ate foods from the @entity135			0
research leader @entity147 , of the @entity40 , explained that they took samples from bones and teeth instead of hair , collagen and proteins like in other studies			0
‘ we also worked on many different periods , with not many individuals for each period , so we could cover a very long time span , ’ she said			0
the scientists compared the carbon isotope ratios with those measured in pigs , which had been fed on a strict diet of different proportions of @entity48 and @entity55 food			0
the animals have a similar metabolism to humans so the carbon ratios could be compared to the mummies ’			0
using their loaves : the finding that @entity2 ate a lot of wheat echoes many paintings in @entity2 tombs that show people working the land and harvesting wheat ( pictured is a painting from the @entity184 ) to make loaves of bread , which are often offered to god of the afterlife , @entity92 when the results were also compared to isotope ratios in the hair of modern @entity194 vegetarians , the experts could confirm that the ancient @entity2 were mostly vegetarians , eating a diet based around wheat and barley			1
they found that @entity55 seeds made up less than 10 per cent of their diet , but surprisingly that the mummies had not eaten much fish in their lifetime			1
it has previously been assumed that the ancient @entity2 ate fish which they caught in the @entity118 , as seen in paintings in tombs			1
the results of the carbon tests appear to contradict such cultural evidence			0
@entity210 , an archaeologist at the @entity211 , said : ‘ there is abundant evidence for fishing in @entity2 wall reliefs and models and fish shows up in offering lists			0
’ ‘ all this makes it a bit surprising that the isotopes should suggest that fish was not widely consumed			0

the ancient @entity2 ate a diet similar to modern vegetarians
