the black designer silk and lace lingerie i bought for my honeymoon four years ago cost almost as much as the wedding			2
as far as i ’m concerned , it ’s worth every penny , because my husband still loves it			1
despite being busy parents of a lively two - year - old boy , my husband , @entity9 , still fancies the pants off me and , if anything , that side of our relationship is better than before we had our son			1
despite being busy parents of a lively two - year - old boy , @entity18 says her husband , @entity9 , still fancies the pants off her our secret ? i maintain it ’s the fact that he was n’t by my side at our son ’s birth			1
and so does @entity9 — whenever he hears about celebrities like @entity30 making a song and dance about being at their wives ’ side during labour , he declares : ‘ that ’s it for them			1
it ’s all over for their sex lives			2
no man should have to watch his wife give birth			1
it is just plain wrong			2
’ far from being cross at his somewhat old - fashioned attitude , i agree with him			1
not only do i believe men should not be there during the actual birth , i do n’t think they should even enter the birthing suite			1
like most modern women , i used to think very differently			2
i had always assumed that , when i gave birth , my husband would be there at my side			1
when i discovered i was pregnant in january 2012 , i ’d already been through two miscarriages			2
so , for the first couple of months , i was terribly cautious about making any plans for the birth			1
my fears were only allayed after my 20 - week scan , when we were told we were expecting a healthy boy			1
@entity18 and her son @entity63			1
she says not only does she believe men should not be there during the actual birth , she does n't think they should even enter the birthing suite i began preparing for the baby ’s arrival , but i guess alarm bells should have started ringing when @entity9 refused to go to our antenatal classes , saying he had no intention of sitting around , listening to a bunch of women talk about cracked nipples			1
he stuck to his guns , even when i told him how humiliating it was being the only woman there without her other half			2
so it was with trepidation that i approached the issue of him being my birthing partner			1
i explained that i really needed him by my side , that as i loved him more than anyone else , and he was responsible for my pregnant state , he simply had to hold my hand			2
i even said he could stay up at the ‘ head - end ’			1
he would n’t have to cut the cord , or ‘ look downstairs ’ , as it were			0
but it was to no avail			0
the answer was the same : a straight , firm , and resolute ‘ no ’			0
@entity18 and husband @entity9 , who is 24 years older than her , on their wedding day the man i ’ve loved for 13 years told me again and again there was absolutely no way he was having anything to do with the birth : he ’d ‘ done his bit ’ and , anyway , he could n’t stand the sight of blood			1
maybe i should have seen it coming			0
@entity9 is from @entity109 and belongs to a line of traditional , testosterone - fuelled men , who think the act of fertilisation is pretty much the beginning and end of their role when it comes to producing offspring			1
he is much older than me — 67 to my 43 — and is very traditional			1
he does the ‘ manly ’ things , like fixing our cars and mowing the lawn			0
@entity18 says @entity9 is very traditional and refused to accompany her to antenatal classes but to him , women ’s stuff is women ’s stuff			1
i cried , i screamed and even refused to speak to him for a week			1
finally , i sat down and , through sobs , begged him to change his mind			0
it was then he revealed the truth			0
‘ i ca n’t , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’ll put me off sex with you for ever			0
’ his admission stopped me in my tracks			0
in that moment , i gave up the fight			0
i could n’t bear for him not to see me in the same way			0
i did n’t want to become nothing more to him than a saggy - bellied , milk - soaked , mummy - type , who had lost her sex appeal.despite my disappointment , my mum and best friend @entity145 , a nurse , kindly stepped in and became my birthing partners			1
@entity18 says giving birth was an ' absolute nightmare of gore and horror ' with hindsight , it was the best outcome for us all			1
the birth , in october 2012 , was an absolute nightmare of gore and horror			1
i have never felt pain like it			0
i pushed for an hour - and - a - half , before the nurse told me my son ’s head was stuck and i was whisked off to theatre for a forceps delivery			1
all the while , @entity9 , who had driven us all to @entity167 in @entity168 , at 6am , was sitting patiently outside my hospital room			1
he had , at least , agreed to stay , rather than go home			0
though that did n’t last — he popped his head around the door as the anaesthetist was preparing my spinal block to announce he was heading off to the pub. ‘ do text if you need me , ’ he said			0
far from being furious , i was relieved			0
i felt exposed and vulnerable			0
him seeing me like this would have made things even worse			0
at one point , i was violently sick all over my best friend ; my hair was stuck to my head with sweat ; i was angry , in pain , and had my legs stuck in stirrups			0
i did n’t want my husband to have the memory of his ‘ top totty ’ ( his nickname for me ) behaving like a crazed farmyard animal			1
there has to be a reason why , for years , men paced up and down the corridors , smoking cigarettes , outside bedrooms and hospital wards across the country			2
this was accepted behaviour for a reason — so a man could look at his wife as a mother , but also as the sexual being he fell in love with			0
at a recent girly get - together , my friend @entity212 confessed that , in the two weeks since she had her second baby , her husband has kept reminding her to do her pelvic floor exercises			1
apparently , having seen the head appear , he is fretting sex will never feel the same			0
another friend confided that her husband had found their daughter ’s birth traumatising			1
the first few times they ’d attempted to make love , he found it impossible			0
a few months ago , i got a call from an old university friend			0
we used to be really close , so i was n’t entirely surprised when he asked if he could tell me something he could never tell his wife			0
he went on to explain that , after watching her give birth , he ’d been incapable of forgetting the memory			2
@entity18 is satisfied that her husband 's view of her has n't changed since she gave birth to their son he seriously thought that he had @entity240 ( @entity240 )			1
as he went on , i began to feel really sorry for him and his wife			0
i knew she would be desperate to feel like a woman again , but he said that he just felt queasy at the thought of them resuming their former marital relationship			0
meanwhile , i know for sure that my husband ’s view of me has n’t changed at all			2
although it took me a while to feel like a woman again , our love life became better than ever , as my husband candidly said he fancied me even more , thanks to all my extra curves			2
every couple ’s sex life takes a while to adjust after the birth of a child			2
but what ’s rarely alluded to is that it ’s often the husbands who are reluctant to reconnect physically			0
they wo n’t admit they find it impossible to think of their wives sexually after witnessing them give birth , or that they feel they succumbed to peer pressure to stay by her side during labour			2
a view like mine might be unfashionable , but men being at the birth is a very recent phenomenon			1
@entity279 once said if he watched his wife in labour , his sex life would be damaged by images he ’d only ever want to see in a sci - fi movie : ‘ it would feel like skinned rabbits and conger eels coming at me from everywhere			2
i did n’t want that to be in my memory			0
’ at the time , i felt really sorry for his wife , @entity288 , forced to live with such a dinosaur			0
but now , i ca n’t help but agree .			0

@entity291 and her husband @entity9 are parents of a two - year - old boy
but @entity18 says he still fancies the pants off her
@entity9 is very traditional and refused to accompany her to antenatal classes
she does n't think men should even enter the birthing suite
she says says giving birth was an ' absolute nightmare of gore and horror '
but her husband is more attracted to her than ever before
