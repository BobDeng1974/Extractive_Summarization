campaigners warn thousands of people have fallen victim to having explicit photographs published on the internet by former partners and spouses			0
new guidance issued by the @entity15 on tackling domestic abuse will include offenders using technology to inflict misery on their victims			1
guidelines on tackling domestic abuse have been broadened to cover technology - aided abuse like ' revenge porn ' the government has already announced plans to to make revenge porn a specific criminal offence under the @entity29 , which is expected to become law next year			1
however , the new @entity15 guidelines are now in force compelling police and prosecutors to consider the use of private photos to exact revenge on exes			1
the new guidelines , which come into force today , brief prosecutors on the ways perpetrators can control , coerce and psychologically abuse victims within families or intimate relationships , and warn that domestic abuse occurs in all communities			2
the guidelines have been broadened to touch on technology - aided abuse like ' revenge porn '			2
' some examples of such abuse may include controlling the use of a complainant 's phone ; harassment through text , mobile , email , social networking sites etc ; posting of inappropriate material such as sexually explicit or nude images or defamatory or insulting comments ; or , stalking a victim through the use of gps technology on a victim 's mobile device , ' the guidelines state			1
the vast majority of victims of revenge porn are female , such as @entity74 , who was labelled a ' whore ' on naked pictures placed on the @entity78 site by an ex-lover			0
director of public prosecutions @entity80 said she was hopeful that a rise in cases was a sign that more victims were coming forward the popstar @entity85 was also a victim when a former boyfriend released a video of her performing a sex act			1
in 2012 - 13 there were nearly 71,000 domestic abuse prosecutions across the @entity91 , the @entity15 says , and this year that figure is expected to swell to almost 90,000			1

' magistrates and prosecutors across the country are telling me that the biggest change they are seeing in the @entity101 is the increase in domestic abuse cases , ' she said			2
' the predicted increase in caseload should be welcomed as a sign that what used to be a ' hidden shame ' is now something that victims choose not suffer in silence , but there are still thousands of silent victims who should not be afraid to speak up about their abuse			2
' these new guidelines will help ensure that our specialist prosecutors will handle these cases with the sensitivity , professionalism and expertise they deserve			0
' the guidelines also include advice on how domestic abuse can occur within gangs , and a section on immigrants , refugees and asylum seekers			0
' these guidelines put the victims of domestic abuse , whoever they may be , at the centre of our work			0
they make it clear that there is no such thing as a ' perfect victim ' and there are many pre-conceptions that need to be challenged , ' ms @entity80 said			0
' we know , for example , that domestic abuse occurs in all walks of life and is often under - reported , sometimes due to issues around fear , intimidation , and shame , but i would urge victims to come forward as they will be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve			1
' i am also clear that we need to consider the implications of our decisions to prosecute , such as working with the police to ensure that victims have the support to leave home on a temporary or permanent basis or that the offender leaves the home , and that they are not prevented from doing so because their abuser controls everything , including finances			0
