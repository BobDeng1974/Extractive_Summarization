attorney general @entity0 suggested friday that the @entity3 administration 's opponents have in part staked out their positions because he and the president are black			1
' there have been times when i thought that ’s at least a piece of it , ' he said			2
but it 's ' hard to look into people ’s minds , you know , their hearts			0
' the graceless exit interview will become grist for conservatives who remain convinced that @entity0 has used race issues to deflect attention from legitimate criticisms			1
a @entity24 reporter pressed @entity0 on whether the @entity26 's detractors were motivated by racial animus , declaring that they were ' more than ( on the ) fringe			1
' you know , " you were n’t born in this country , you are the ' other ' " , ' he parroted			0
' i mean , you come up with other – you come up with ways in which you try to be effective in your attacks			0
' ' and certain people have been , you know , less sensitive than they should have been to understand that certain things , given our history , ' he said , seemingly invoking @entity31 's history of slavery from more than 150 years ago			1
' there are certain places that you just should n’t – you should n’t go			0
' @entity0 famously said just days after assuming his office in february 2009 that @entity31 had been ' a nation of cowards ' on race			1
' race - related issues , ' he claimed in a speech , ' continue to occupy a significant portion of our political discussion			1
' on his way out of the @entity66 , @entity0 said he would soon call for a change in the standard of proof the agency uses when deciding whether it can prosecute @entity31 in cases where civil rights abuses are alleged			1
he plans to make a move before his successor , @entity75 federal prosecutor @entity74 , moves into his office			0
the @entity76 approved @entity74 yesterday , with three republicans crossing the aisle to vote for her			0
a full @entity76 vote will come soon			0
no charges : @entity81 ( left ) wo n't face civicl rights prosecution for killing @entity83 ( right ) , and @entity0 wants to change the future standard of proof changing the civil - rights prosecution standard would make it easier for the @entity66 to prosecute @entity31 like @entity88 , the @entity89 man who shot and killed the unarmed teen @entity83 in 2012			1
the @entity3 administration announced this week that it wo n't move forward on that case since it had ' insufficient evidence to pursue federal criminal civil rights charges			2
' @entity0 seemed to regret that outcome			2
' i think some serious consideration needs to be given to the standard of proof that has to be met before federal involvement is appropriate , and that ’s something that i am going to be talking about before i leave office , ' he said			0
' i think that if we adjust those standards , we can make the federal government a better backstop – make us more a part of the process in an appropriate way to reassure the @entity31 people that decisions are made by people who are really disintereste ' in the outcome .			2
