ruling : @entity6 , 24 , from @entity7 , crashed on the @entity8 , @entity9 , in july 2008 , killing @entity10 , 19 and injuring several other passengers miss @entity19 took her hands off the wheel to cover up and the @entity22 veered off course and struck the guardrail , flipped multiple times in the air , before coming to rest on its roof in the middle of the southbound lanes			1
mr @entity10 of @entity30 was a rear seat passenger - he was partially ejected and suffered massive head trauma			1
he was pronounced dead at @entity33			0
the @entity34 upheld the conclusion of a @entity37 jury , which found miss @entity19 's bikini top problem constituted ' a sudden and unforeseen emergency not of her own making ' reported the @entity40			0

' day out : mr @entity10 playfully untied miss @entity19 's bathing suit top as they returned home from a day at @entity16 ( pictured ) the decision was taken following a civil trial brought by @entity53 of @entity54			1
he sued miss @entity19 for damages after his promising football career at @entity57 was cut short due to his injuries			0
he was in the rear seat of the car and testified at the 2011 trial that miss @entity19 had leaned forward for up to 20 seconds as she tried to retie her bikini top			0
his lawyers argued she should have pulled over saying ' the plaintiff argues that defendant @entity6 should have slowed her vehicle down , kept both hands on the wheel , and pulled off of the highway , before attempting to re-tie her bathing suit , and the mere fact that she may have been embarrassed by the exposure of her breasts to the passengers in the car does not excuse her failure to do so			1
' but miss @entity19 testified that her hands were off the steering wheel for only a split second and the jury absolved her of any liability			0
the dissenting appellate judge , justice @entity81 , said that mr @entity10 ’s behavior was disruptive before the bikini top prank - he had opened an umbrella inside the car and stuck his feet in the driver ’s face			2
' that @entity10 would ultimately commit an act which would cause @entity42 to lose control of the vehicle , under the circumstances of this case , can not be deemed sudden or unexpected , ' ms @entity81 wrote			2
