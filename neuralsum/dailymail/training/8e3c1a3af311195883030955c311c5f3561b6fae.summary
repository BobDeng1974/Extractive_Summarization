while @entity2 insists @entity4 referees are conspiring against him , the @entity1 manager has only himself to blame for not being seven points ahead of @entity6			1
@entity7 was allowed to leave @entity8 in june , when the 36 - year - old signed for @entity10 before moving on loan to the @entity14 outfit 's sister club in @entity15			2
the former @entity17 midfielder has won last season 's @entity4 champions seven points this campaign , his latest two coming after turning a draw into a win against @entity23 on @entity24			1
the former @entity17 midfielder has won last year 's @entity4 champions seven points this year @entity7 was allowed to leave @entity8 in june , where the 36 - year - old signed for @entity10 @entity2 's men are top of the @entity4 but only by alphabetical order with @entity6 176 goals 138 with right foot 22 with left foot 16 with head 43 penalties 147 for @entity1 5 for @entity6 4th highest scorer ever that earned @entity6 two points and was reward following 48 hours of negotiations to extend @entity7 's deal at the @entity41			1
another two came away against @entity42 on december 13 when , without @entity7 's winner in the 40th minute , they would have been held to a 0 - 0 draw at the @entity45			0
but his first and most significant contribution to @entity47 came on september 21 when @entity1 were in town , winning 1 - 0 against 10 men after @entity50 was sent off			0
@entity7 's equaliser in the 85th minute not only rescued @entity6 one point , but dropped two for @entity1 in the process , making his total seven so far			2
@entity2 and @entity47 are level , sharing 46 points and a plus - 25 goal difference , but @entity1 could be the happier in 2015 had @entity7 not been wearing a lighter shade of blue			1
lampard scores against @entity1 to save a point for @entity6 and drop two for @entity1 at the @entity41 @entity7 refused to celebrate scoring the 85th - minute equaliser against former club @entity1 in september @entity7 scored against @entity1 to drop two points for the @entity4 leaders by alphabetical order @entity64 has confirmed he will leave @entity65 at the end of this season			1
click here for the full story @entity7 's latest strike was his 176th , too , making him the fourth highest @entity4 goalscorer of all time ahead of @entity73 on 175			1
he chases @entity75 's @entity74 on 181 and is 11 off second - placed @entity76			0
he will probably not overtake @entity77 on 260 goals			0
given the accuracy and power of his winner against @entity23 , it is perhaps surprising that was just @entity7 's 16th @entity4 goal with his head , having always favoured his right foot ( 138 )			2
meanwhile in @entity86 , @entity2 has continued his conspiracy theory that there is some sort of campaign against @entity1			0
his latest claim came after referee @entity92 did not award them a penalty in the 5 - 3 loss against @entity96 at @entity97			0
so , if the special one misses out on the @entity4 title come may by such a slender margin , he will rue giving @entity6 the opportunity to use their own weapon against them			0
@entity1 's @entity7 and manager @entity2 celebrate their win over @entity104 in the 2005 @entity105 @entity7 ( left ) , @entity2 and @entity106 celebrate winning the @entity4 title in may 2005			2
