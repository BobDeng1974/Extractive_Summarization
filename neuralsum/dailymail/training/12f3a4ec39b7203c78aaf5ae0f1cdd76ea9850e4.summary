they ’ve brought their form from their club sides into the @entity3 set - up and that ’s what i ’ve noticed			1
‘ hopefully they can continue that into the @entity4 itself			1
there are two players pushing in every position to get into the starting xi and not much between them in every position			2
‘ the manager could pick five teams for the @entity30 game and you would n’t see a big difference in the standard			2
that ’s what gives me hope			2
’ @entity26 , who was the best player in an open training session on friday , misses out today after his dismissal in the 2 - 2 draw with @entity40 in the @entity13			1
@entity15 said : ‘ as you can imagine , @entity26 was absolutely gutted to be sent off , as were we			1
‘ it was an over-exuberant challenge and a slightly reckless act			2
it was his desire to help us out of a difficult situation , using his incredible pace to reach @entity80			2
‘ i was impressed with @entity82 ’s comments afterwards			2
‘ the referee was entitled to send him off , so it was strong of @entity82 to do what he did			0

cool customer : @entity25 puts a towel over his face to keep cool during training heated battle : @entity94 and @entity96 fight for the ball safe hands : @entity99 makes a save during training and @entity3 ’s head coach made it clear that he has been so impressed with the @entity104 forward that he could face @entity106 ’s team in @entity31 on june 14 in the opening group game			1
@entity30 have n’t won in seven games and drew 1 - 1 with @entity109 , the 120th - ranked team , in their final officially recognised friendly in @entity112			1
@entity15 added : ‘ be careful going down that route			1
i ’ve worked in @entity30			0
i know the @entity115 mentality and their players			0

it does n’t bother them			0
the actual team wo n’t be bothered			0
’ @entity15 is also continuing to monitor @entity127 ’s injury to his medial knee ligaments as the squad prepare to travel to @entity14			1
@entity3 ’s manager will wait until 24 hours before their opening game , as per @entity133 rules , to decide whether to keep him with the squad			1
@entity15 added : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s a gamble at all			2
at the moment we have 23 men : three goalkeepers and 20 outfield players			0
possession game : @entity141 wins the ball from @entity25 during training watching on : @entity144 watches the training session from the sidelines ‘ he was chosen for a reason			2
he fits in our balance			0
i do n’t think anyone we choose to replace him will give us anything additional to the squad			0
we ’re very anxious to keep him here			0
i ’ll have to listen to the doctors and see what he ’s likely to miss and when he ’s likely to be fit , but i wo n’t be dashing out because he might not be fit for the first game			2
‘ we ’d want people like him around			0
i ’m neither confident nor lacking in confidence			0
‘ i ’m waiting to see what happens			0
i ’m not a doctor			0
i ’ll be accepting with what the doctors tell me			0
a decision will be made			0
they ’ll tell me their prognosis and then we ’ll make a decision			0
’ @entity3 face @entity7 in almost unbearable heat on saturday afternoon in @entity42 and they will head for their base camp in @entity169 straight after today ’s game			1
@entity1 is thriving in his role as captain and revealed pointedly yesterday that former @entity3 manager @entity173 did not believe in his leadership skills			1
‘ @entity173 did n’t believe in me as his no 1 captain , ’ the @entity104 midfielder said			0
‘ he did believe in me as a player , he rated me as a player and our relationship was fine			0
‘ at the time we picked the captain , he had @entity182 and @entity183 and he thought they offered something different for him			0
