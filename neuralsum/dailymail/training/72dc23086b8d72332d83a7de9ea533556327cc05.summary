a mother diagnosed with terminal cancer is preparing for what could be her last @entity3 after doctors mistook bleeding and cramping as signs of pregnancy			1
@entity7 went into premature labour with her second daughter at just 26 weeks			1
it was only then that doctors discovered the 28 - year - old had cervical cancer			1
she barely had time to come to terms with the news when her daughter @entity16 was born 14 weeks early , drastically underweight at 2lb 2oz and battling for life			1
both mother and daughter were treated in the same hospital but while @entity16 is now thriving , mrs @entity7 has been told her cancer has spread and is now terminal			1
@entity7 , 28 ( centre ) , has incurable cancer and has been told she has just 12 to 18 months left with her two daughters , @entity26 , six ( right ) and @entity16 , one month old ( left ) in may she was given 12 to 18 months to live			1
but she has vowed to fight the illness for as long as possible for the sake of @entity16 and her older daughter @entity26 , six			2
she decided to marry her partner - and the girls ' father - @entity31 , and is determined to give her family their best @entity3 ever knowing it may be their last together			1
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ i have promised them i will be here for them for as long as i can			1
' there are times when i feel overwhelmed and scared and then i look at them and i know i have to stay strong			2
‘ @entity16 fought so hard to live after being born so early that i owe her and @entity26 the same			1
‘ i want to make this @entity3 so special for them			2
i hope to create some special memories for us all			2
’ she is currently funding alternative treatments with donations from well wishers to extend her time with her girls			0
she said : ‘ every day it buys me with them is worth it and i am extremely grateful to the people who have fundraised to help give me that precocious time			0
‘ i just want to make enough memories for my girls to last them a lifetime			2
’ she hopes sharing her story will raise awareness of cervical cancer , especially in pregnant women			1
‘ people need to know pregnant women can get cervical cancer too , ' she told @entity62			1
cervical cancer is an uncommon type of cancer that develops in a woman 's cervix , the entrance to the womb from the vagina			2
cervical cancer often has no symptoms in its early stages			1
the most common symptom is unusual vaginal bleeding , which can occur after sex , in - between periods or after the menopause			2
in the @entity77 , the @entity76 offers a national screening programme open to all women from the age of 25			0
during screening , a cervical smear test is performed			0
a small sample of cells is taken from the cervix and checked under a microscope for abnormalities			0
if cervical cancer is diagnosed at an early stage , it 's usually possible to treat it using surgery			2
in some cases it 's possible to leave the womb in place , but it may need to be removed			0
the surgical procedure used to remove the womb is called a hysterectomy			0
radiotherapy is an alternative to surgery for some women with early stage cervical cancer			1
in some cases it is used alongside surgery			0
more advanced cases of cervical cancer are usually treated using a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy			1
some of the treatments used can have significant and long - lasting side effects , including early menopause and infertility			0
' the signs were all there but dismissed as pregnancy symptoms and i ’m afraid that has cost me my life			2
’ mrs @entity7 , a primary school teaching assistant from @entity122 , suffered severe bleeding and cramping from the start of her pregnancy			1
she claims she went to hospital on multiple occasions , but tests had failed to detect the true cause			2
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ i felt strongly that something was very wrong			1
i ’d never experienced anything like it with my first pregnancy			0
‘ i must have gone to hospital bleeding at least 10 times only to be told nothing was wrong			1
‘ but eventually i had to take the doctors and midwives at their word and trust that things were ok			0
’ fearing she was experiencing contractions just 26 weeks into her pregnancy , mrs @entity7 went to hospital in october 2013			1
at the @entity142 a midwife examined her cervix for the first time			0
she confirmed that at just 26 weeks mrs @entity7 was 2cm dilated but also revealed she had seen a lesion that was causing the bleeding			1
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ initially i felt relieved to finally have an answer and assurance that my baby was not in danger			1
’ but it was only when doctors said they needed to perform a biopsy on the 7cm mass that she realised she might be in danger			0
doctors administered steroid injections to help her baby ’s lungs develop in preparation for birth			2
two days later , mrs @entity7 learned she had cancer			1
she said : ‘ when the specialist came to my bedside and said he was an oncologist my heart sank to the pit of my stomach			0
i knew what it meant			0
‘ when he said i had cervical cancer my hands went straight to my bump			2
i just kept saying to him " but i ’m about to have a baby "			0
’ it became clear that all her symptoms , bleeding , discharge , back pain and stomach pain had slipped under the radar because they are associated with normal pregnancies too			2
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ of course i was shocked and disappointed that it had n’t been picked up earlier but there was n’t time for ifs and buts because i needed to focus on my unborn baby			1
’ it was discovered mrs @entity7 had cervical cancer when she went into labour with @entity16 ( left ) prematurely at 26 weeks			1
the cancer spread to her lungs and she was told it was terminal			1
she hopes to make this @entity3 , possibly her last , extra special doctors agreed they needed to keep the baby , a girl @entity197 and her husband had already named @entity16 , inside her to increase her chance of survival			1
they planned to deliver her by c - section at 30 weeks and perform a full hysterectomy to fight the cancer at the same time			2
initially drugs to slow labour worked and mrs @entity7 was sent home to rest			1
but the following night her waters broke at home and because the baby was breech			0
she was rushed into surgery on october 27			0
she said : ‘ i came round and saw @entity31 was smiling			2
he told me @entity16 had been born crying and nobody could believe she was already breathing on her own			2
’ but the odds were stacked against her as she weighed just 2lbs 2oz , much less than the average of 7lb 4oz for girls in the @entity77			0
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ at first i was too scared to see her but @entity16 was so strong i knew i had to be strong too			1
i could n’t touch or hold her but she was so beautiful			0
days later mrs @entity7 started chemotherapy and radiotherapy while @entity16 continued to make good progress			1
they were treated in different wards at the same hospital			0
but at five weeks old @entity16 contacted necrotising enterocolitis , a life - threatening bowel condition common in premature babies			2
after being told she had terminal cancer , mrs @entity7 ( right ) decided to marry partner @entity31 ( left )			1
they arranged the wedding in two weeks			0
here , the pair are pictured on their big day at seven weeks old she needed surgery to remove a 10cm portion of her bowel			0
still weighing just 3lbs , staff warned she may not survive			0
to their relief and joy , @entity16 pulled through and mrs @entity7 drew on her tiny daughter ’s strength to fight her own battle			1
she said : ‘ i felt overwhelmed and exhausted			0
at times i felt utter disbelief that this was happening to us , but i just needed to think of her and my family to keep going			0
’ three months after she was born @entity16 was finally discharged			2
weeks later more good news came when mrs @entity7 was told her treatment had been a success			1
scans had shown there was no longer any sign of cancer in her cervix			0
mrs @entity7 is currently funding alternative treatments through donations from well - wishers ‘ since @entity16 had been born we had taken life one day at a time , but finally it felt like we could think about the future , ' she said			1
‘ it was like we ’d both had death sentences lifted			0
’ but their joy was short - lived			0
in may mrs @entity7 developed a nasty cough that would n’t shift , so visited her gp			1
on her fourth visit to the doctor a scan confirmed her worst fear			0
the cancer had spread to her lungs and was terminal ; she was given 12 to 18 months to live			1
‘ it was like the rug had been pulled from beneath us all over again , ' she said			0
' i was in shock			0
i cried for two weeks solidly			0
i just could n’t believe that after all that i was going to be taken from them anyway			0
’ but after starting the heartbreaking task of making memory boxes and filming videos to be shown to her daughters when they were older , mrs @entity7 instead decided to put her energy into something positive and told family she wanted to get married			1
the couple had been engaged for three years and mr @entity287 planned their wedding in just two weeks			0
their daughters were bridesmaids and shortly after mrs @entity7 started a course of chemotherapy to try and extend her life			1
she also researched alternative therapies to boost her health allow her to make the most of the time she has left			0
she is currently funding the treatment , which she says is keeping her strong , from money raised through fundraising and donations from well wishers			0
she said : ‘ thanks to them i can go on being mum and try to enjoy as much time as possible with my beautiful girls			0
‘ from what doctors have told me this could be my last @entity3 with them so i want to make it the best ever			2
