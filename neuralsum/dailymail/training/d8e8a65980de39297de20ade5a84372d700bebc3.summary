what 's in a nugget ? researchers in @entity8 examined two fast - food chains ' chicken nuggets and found that half or less than half of the nuggets were made of meat			1
the rest was made of high - fat chicken parts the second chicken nugget was even worse with out 40 per cent muscle , with the rest being made up of fat cartilage and bone			1
the researchers decided not to name the fast food chains			2
