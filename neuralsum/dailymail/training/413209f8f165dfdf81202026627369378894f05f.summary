@entity1 and the @entity2 must brace themselves for more bloody atrocities before @entity6 jihadists in @entity7 are defeated , former top brass said last night			1
retired commanders issued the chilling warning as they urged @entity10 to deploy more @entity12 warplanes to fight @entity14 fanatics			0
the ex-military chiefs also suggested stepping up @entity17 operations to ‘ spoil the day ’ of the fanatics , including @entity19 , who have swept across northern @entity7			1
recruiters : @entity1 jihadis @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 are seen in an is video released earlier this year			0
in the video , the trio encourage other @entity1 to join them air chief marshal sir @entity28 , a former head of the @entity12 , and air commodore @entity30 , a former air defence chief who commanded forces in @entity7 , called for @entity1 to ramp up military options in @entity7			1
they spoke out after gruesome images were published on the internet of a jihadist , with a @entity1 accent , murdering @entity39 journalist @entity38 – claiming it was in revenge for @entity39 air strikes			1
as mr @entity10 condemned the ‘ brutal and barbaric murder ’ , foreign secretary @entity43 said @entity1 troops could be sent to @entity46 to help train @entity7 soldiers to counter the growing threat			1
so far the @entity1 has deployed an @entity50 spy plane – a flying ‘ listening post ’ that picks up chatter made over mobile phones or radios – and six @entity56 fighter jets fitted with state - of - the - art surveillance equipment that beam real - time images of targets to commanders			1
the aim is to gather vast amounts of crucial intelligence , including on militants ’ manoeuvres , to support humanitarian efforts – but this could be used to support @entity39 bombers in strike missions to oust @entity14			1
but sir @entity28 , who served as @entity71 from 1992 to 1997 , warned the @entity2 must be prepared for jihadists taking retribution against other hostages as they were pounded by air strikes			1
referring to mr @entity38 ’s murder , he said : ‘ being blunt , we sadly must expect more of this			2
we are dealing with fanatical , religious people who are long past the point of normal behaviour			0
’ air chief marshal sir @entity28 , a former head of the @entity12 , and air commodore @entity30 , a former air defence chief who commanded forces in @entity7 , called for @entity1 to ramp up military options in @entity7			1
they spoke out after a jihadist , with a @entity1 accent , murdered @entity39 journalist @entity38 - claiming it was in revenge for @entity39 air strikes he said the @entity2 should continue ‘ evening the game up ’ by supplying weapons , mortars and rockets to the @entity96 soldiers , who are fighting @entity97			1
‘ the jihadists have got their hands on artillery and weapons looted from the @entity7 army , which has given them a huge advantage			2
we should now be arming the @entity96 to even up the playing field			0
’ sending more @entity12 reconnaissance planes to the troubled region ‘ will always be useful ’ in building up an intelligence picture of the fanatics			2
sir @entity28 said @entity1 @entity17 on the ground could be deployed on top - secret operations to inflict huge damage on advancing extremists			1
‘ what i think they can do , if they are working closely with the @entity96 , and i ’m sure they are , is conduct missions which require the jihadists to mass [ in an area ] and the moment they mass , you have got a target			0
then you can send in bombers and do things to them that really spoil their day			0
’ air commodore @entity30 , who commanded @entity131 forces in enforcing a no - fly zone over northern @entity7 in 1999 , said he believed @entity1 should put on a greater show of military strength to deter the jihadists			1
in responce to the shocking footage of @entity38 's beheading , which was titled ' a message to @entity39 ' , @entity1 foreign secretary @entity43 to vow @entity1 would ' oppose @entity140 with every breath in our body ' he said : ‘ if you want me to make one criticism , it ’s this : the scale of the operation is probably too small			1
when we had the no - fly zone , there were 50 or 60 aircraft			0
symbolically it quite often is useful to give messages to people that if you have a robust package then people take you more seriously that you know what is going on			0
’ he said deploying more @entity12 planes with reconnaissance equipment would allow ‘ continuous coverage ’ of the battlefield , compared to only a few hours that the @entity12 can do at present			0
air commodore @entity30 added : ‘ obviously , if the threat increases then i would expect the @entity1 and @entity39 to increase the number of assets there			1
’ one of the @entity1 jihadists in the region , @entity23 , is a 20 - year - old former @entity169 schoolboy who featured prominently in @entity14 ’s first professionally produced @entity171 propaganda video , which urged young @entity19 in the @entity2 to join the terror group			1
yesterday , @entity23 mocked @entity39 efforts to defend @entity7 ’s @entity175 minority from genocide at the hands of @entity97 militants , saying on @entity179 they ‘ ca n’t even protect their own citizens ’			1
the young jihadist , who describes himself on @entity179 as a ‘ soldier of the @entity14 ’ , said last month the @entity1 government should be ‘ afraid ’ of his bomb - making skills			1
@entity23 has been joined in @entity186 by his younger brother @entity188 , 17			0
the brothers , who grew up in @entity169 after their father moved there from @entity191 as a teenager , are among hundreds of young @entity1 who have travelled to @entity186 to join the rebels			0
@entity1 @entity19 must be stronger in their condemnation of jihadists and the hate preachers who recruit them , @entity196 community leaders said yesterday			2
in the wake of @entity39 journalist @entity38 ’s brutal murder , they urged imams and mosques to do more to combat extremists – even if it means risking reprisals			1
some imams have already made repeated appeals to radicalised youngsters not to join militants in the @entity211			0
the @entity212 has urged @entity196 communities to unite and tell the jihadists : ‘ not in our name			0
’ @entity1 @entity19 must be stronger in their condemnation of jihadists and the hate preachers who recruit them , @entity196 community leaders said yesterday			1
including dr @entity217 , director of the @entity218 of @entity219 but critics have unfavourably compared the recent appeals , via open letters and @entity224 videos , with the thousands - strong marches organised to protest @entity227 ’s military action against @entity228 , or the publication of a cartoon of @entity231 in a @entity233 magazine			0
dr @entity217 , director of the @entity218 of @entity219 , said : ‘ this grotesque murder characterises @entity19 as barbaric savages			2
if this senseless killing does n’t change people ’s attitudes , what will ? ‘ in the @entity1 the majority of the @entity218 population are @entity242 and the @entity242 group has been remarkably silent about what is happening in @entity7			1
the time has now come for a mass outcry from mainstream @entity19 , not only about this murder but also the persecution of the @entity7 yazidis and @entity250 and the killing of other @entity19			2
’ @entity252 , chief executive of the @entity218 educational charity @entity253 , added that some religious leaders had been too slow to condemn the @entity14 terrorists due to fear of reprisals from extremists in @entity1			2
he admitted : ‘ in the past i have been more careful and shown restraint but enough is enough			0
‘ i ’m prepared to take more risks to defy these evil people			0
i utterly condemn is even if it puts me at personal risk , at danger of people coming to my home			0
i ’m no longer prepared to be muted			0
’ he called on the government to take tougher action against jihadists who travelled to @entity7 or @entity186 to fight – despite having supported jihad himself in the past			1
the married father of 12 said he fought the @entity276 - backed government in @entity277 , but now believed fighters were driven by aggression , not religious devotion			0
he told the @entity283 : ‘ they seek guns and violence			0
it is not about jihad or religion , it is all pure escapism and adventure			0
’ @entity290 , chief executive of @entity291 ’s @entity290 , said @entity1 would be at risk of terror attacks if radicalised fighters are allowed to return			2
he spoke out against @entity97 , formerly known as @entity140 , saying : ‘ i utterly condemn the senseless and barbaric killing of @entity38 by the terrorist group @entity140			2
‘ if this barbaric killing was not enough then the allegation that the beheading was carried out by a @entity1 citizen is deeply worrying for our nation			2
’ the @entity212 released a statement saying : ‘ each day @entity140 seeks to carry out an act more barbarous than the day before , craving the oxygen of publicity to give credibility to their heinous acts			2
‘ we condemn unreservedly their psychopathic violence , whether it is on minorities , on civilians or on fellow @entity19			0
