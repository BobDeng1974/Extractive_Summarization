by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 11:33 am on 12th october 2011 middle - income families are suffering an ‘ unprecedented collapse ’ in living standards as inflation and poor wages wipe thousands off incomes			1
on the eve of the release of the worst unemployment figures for 17 years , the @entity8 found families are about to endure their biggest income drop since the 1970s			1
this means a typical couple with two children is likely to be £ 2,080 worse off in 2013 terms than they were last year as their real income falls from £ 30,056 to £ 27,976			1
worrying times : the @entity21 warned that the next two years will be ' dominated by a large decline ' in incomes the @entity8 warned that the next two years will be ‘ dominated by a large decline ’ in incomes			1
it revealed median incomes are set to fall by 7 per cent after inflation has been taken into account – the sharpest drop in 35 years			0
a leading think - tank today warned the economic recovery in the @entity31 was the weakest of any since the end of the @entity33			1
the warning came as the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) said its monthly estimates suggest gross domestic product ( gdp ) grew at 0.5 per cent in the three months to september , compared to a revised 0.4 per cent in the quarter to august			0
@entity35 said the level of @entity38 in the period is still 4 per cent below the pre-recession peak - suggesting the recovery is the weakest since 1918			1
the figures for the third quarter may surprise some economists who have forecast near stagnant growth between july and september			0
the study said : ‘ the unprecedented collapse in living standards is chiefly due to the high inflation and weak earnings growth over this period			1
’ @entity52 , of the @entity8 , described it as the ‘ delayed effect ’ of the recession			2
he said : ‘ real earnings did n’t fall for a while after the economy started contracting , partly because inflation was very low			0
‘ but inflation has risen sharply and earnings have not done so in response			0
’ the grim report came as another respected think - tank warned @entity31 recovery will be the weakest ‘ since the end of the @entity33 ’ , as the economy remains mired in a ‘ depression ’			1
the @entity35 estimated gdp rose by just 0.5 per cent in the three months to september			0
in its monthly report , @entity35 said the figures were a slight improvement compared with growth of 0.4 per cent in the three months to august			0
but it said the level of @entity38 is still 4 per cent below the pre-recession peak – suggesting the recovery is the weakest since 1918			2
it added : ‘ @entity31 economic growth over the past year has been anaemic			0
’ an individual is in relative poverty if they live in a household whose income is below 60 % of the average in that year , and in absolute poverty if a household 's real - terms income is below 60 % of the 2010/11 average			1
source : @entity8 unemployment : the number of jobless people is set to hit a 17 - year high economists had predicted stronger growth for the period to september as the weak second quarter was blamed on special factors , such as the @entity97 bank holiday			2
the @entity8 also forecast that 600,000 more children will be pushed into poverty by 2013 , taking the total living in ‘ absolute ’ poverty to 3.1million			1
it says the @entity104 ’s tax and benefit reforms will drive down real incomes , and the new @entity107 system will fail to make up for the losses of the poor			0
the report was seized upon by @entity111 as evidence that the government is condemning hundreds of thousands of children to lives in poverty			2
and @entity118 treasury minister @entity117 said : ‘ the @entity120 - led @entity113 ’s policy of cutting spending and raising taxes too far and too fast has delivered slower growth and higher unemployment , which will mean billions more borrowing than planned			2
’ but universities minister @entity128 insisted : ‘ we have tried to hold down fuel duty , we are freezing council tax , we have increased the income tax allowance , we have tried to do the things that help , but you ca n’t ignore the basic rules of economics , that when you inherit a situation where an economy has shrunk by 7 per cent there is n’t the money there			2
’ however , official figures , to be published today , are expected to show the unemployment crisis is getting worse , particularly among the young			1
the latest figures released by the @entity143 showed a record 20.8 per cent of those aged between 16 and 24 are unemployed			0
and the numbers are rising rapidly			0
between may and july , an extra 78,000 joined the youth unemployed , pushing the total to 973,000			0
economists fear today ’s figures could show the number hitting an all - time record of 1million			0
total unemployment is expected to top the 2,521,000 recorded in 1994 .			1

warning recovery is weakest since @entity33
unemployment figures due out today expected to be worst for 17 years
@entity21 forecasts 600,000 more children will be pushed into poverty by 2013 , taking the total living in ‘ absolute ’ poverty to 3.1m
