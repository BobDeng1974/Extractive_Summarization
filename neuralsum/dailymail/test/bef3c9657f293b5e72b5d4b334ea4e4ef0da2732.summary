@entity0 started embellishing his stories because he felt insecure following in @entity4 's very large footsteps at @entity5 , according to a new report			1
the network handed @entity0 a six - month suspension in february after he acknowledged he had lied about being on board a helicopter that came under fire while reporting from @entity12 in 2003			1
but according to a report in @entity14 , @entity0 started exaggerating his stories because he felt insecure about @entity4 , whom he succeeded at @entity15 in 2004			1
' i always felt he needed to jack up his stories because he was trying so hard to overcome his insecurities , ' one executive told the publication			2
clash : @entity4 and @entity0 are pictured in @entity21 in 2004 - the year @entity0 took over @entity4 's role on the @entity15			1
a new report has claimed @entity0 always felt insecure following him ' and he had to follow @entity4 , which brought its own set of insecurities			1
he likes to sort of tell these grandiose tales ... i just saw it as one of the quirks of his personality			2
' but according to former correspondents who spoke to @entity14 , @entity4 was n't so accepting of the ' quirks '			1
the stories left him ' incensed ' , the publication reported			2
on one occasion , @entity0 implied they had both been in @entity39 together on the day the wall fell in 1989 - but he actually joined the veteran newscaster there the following day			2
on hearing the tale , @entity4 went into ' spasms of anger ' , one former exec told @entity14			1
' @entity4 treated that anchor chair as a public trust , ' a former employee said			2
' he really was our @entity50			0
' others said that the two men had a troubled relationship after @entity0 took over the role because even though @entity4 pushed for him to get the job , @entity0 never ' embraced ' him			1
' i do n't know why , ' a source said			0
' [ @entity0 ] knows the rank and file will never love him like they did @entity4 , so he never tries			1
that 's the reason there 's not a lot of support for @entity0 over there			2
' exaggerations : during a report in february , pictured , @entity0 recounted a tale of how he had been on a chinook that came under fire while in @entity12 in 2003 - but he had actually been in a separate aircraft it also meant that when @entity0 found himself in hot water over his claim he had been in a downed @entity70 - when he had actually been in a separate aircraft - @entity76 did n't have his back			1
a friend told the publication that while @entity4 - who was ' livid ' about the scandal - did n't call for @entity0 to be punished , he ' did n't try to save him either			1
' following the suspension , @entity0 reportedly declared to a friend : ' @entity84 one up for @entity4			1
' not impressed : @entity4 , pictured in february , came ' incensed ' when he heard @entity0 ' exaggerations the article also claimed that when he was called out for lying in his reports and conversations following the 2003 helicopter incident , @entity0 could n't bring himself to admit he had made it up - and instead , he suggested he might have a brain tumor			1
' ( he said , ) ' did something happen to ( my ) head ? maybe i had a brain tumor , or something in my head ' , ' a source said			1
' he just did n't know			0
we just did n't know			0
we had no clear sense what had happened			0
we got the best ( apology ) we could get			0
' when it came to uncovering the truth behind what actually happened in the 2003 helicopter incident , @entity5 quickly learned @entity0 himself would be of no help			1
' he was having a tough enough time coming to grips with the idea that he had gotten it wrong in the first place , slash misrepresented it , slash lied , ' one insider said			0
others suggested that the problem with @entity0 ' work was because the newscaster , who had never been a war or foreign correspondent before taking over at @entity15 , had no interest in reporting on war stories or ' heavy ' news and lacked the experience of his predecessors			1
his appearance on late - night talk shows and comedy series , such as @entity130 , suggested that instead of getting into gritty news , he actually wanted his own talk show , @entity14 suggested			2
while some @entity5 employees say this diversity was admirable and something his predecessors had never mastered , others say it did not go down well with the network			1
' he did n't want to leave @entity21 , ' one source said			0
' getting him to war zones was real tough ... but when he did go , he came back with these great stories that kind of put himself at the center of things			0
' in february , @entity0 was forced to admit that he was n't aboard the helicopter that was hit and forced down by enemy fire in @entity12 in 2003 - a story he had often repeated over the past 12 years			1
' overwhelmed ' : sources told @entity14 that @entity0 , pictured in @entity12 , did not want to report on ' hard ' news and did n't enjoy politics or war stories , and lacked the experience of his predecessors lies : during a report in 2003 , he reported how a @entity70 , pictured , had been grounded but he later claimed he had been aboard the aircraft that was shot down			1
in fact , he was on one about 30 minutes behind it came after he claimed on the @entity15 in january that his aircraft had been hit , causing outrage from the soldiers who had actually been involved			0
crew members on the 159th @entity161 's @entity70 that was hit by two rockets and small arms fire had told @entity164 that the @entity5 anchor was nowhere near the aircraft or two other chinooks that had been flying in formation when they took fire			2
according to the crew members , @entity0 arrived about an hour later on another helicopter after the other three had made an emergency landing			2
even though @entity0 learned about the uproar over his false story on @entity174 , he failed to bring it up with @entity5 execs when he met with them the next day , suggesting deeper flaws within the network and its relationship with staff , former employees told @entity14			1
days after the false report , he acknowledged the lie as he spoke to a reporter			0
' i would not have chosen to make this mistake , ' @entity0 told @entity164			0
' i do n't know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another			0
' while @entity0 initially believed he 'd be back to work within days , he was ultimately suspended for six months , and he accepted that he had to step back , sources said			1
@entity15 is now being anchored by @entity194 and it is unclear if @entity0 will return			1
questions : a number of @entity0 ' seemingly outlandish claims also came under scrutiny @entity200 , @entity201 , 1970s in a 2011 interview , @entity0 recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy			2
but in a 2005 @entity208 interview , @entity0 said he saved two puppies			0
in the same @entity208 interview , @entity0 also revealed he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling @entity213 trees in the sleepy @entity201 town in which he grew up			0
a number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone ' stuck a .38 - caliber in my face '			0
@entity222 , 2003 over the years , @entity0 has told multiple versions of a story about being in an army chinook helicopter during the @entity222 in 2003			1
earlier this year , he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire , an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present			0
@entity0 issued an on - air apology and wrote on @entity174 : ' nobody 's trying to steal anyone 's valor			0
' he was later suspended over the incident			0
@entity236 , 2005 @entity0 has told several stories about his experiences reporting from @entity239			0
he has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city 's @entity243 â€“ even though the area was n't flooded			0
the accuracy of other @entity236 claims , including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was ' overrun ' with gangs , have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster			0
@entity256 , 2006 in a 2007 interview with @entity258 , @entity0 recalled ' katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter i was riding in ' during a trip to @entity256			2
in fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire ' six miles away '			0
@entity267 , 2006 a @entity269 vet accused @entity0 of lying to skip an event honoring members of the @entity272 so that he could appear on @entity273			2
on the day of the @entity277 event the @entity275 anchor told organizers that a ' pressing engagement ' meant he would n't be able speak at the dinner , but later that evening he appeared in a walk - on role on @entity273 's @entity282 .			0

@entity0 was suspended from @entity5 in february after it emerged he 'd lied about being in a helicopter that was shot down in @entity12 in 2003
a new report in @entity14 claims @entity0 lied because he felt insecure taking over from beloved anchor @entity4 at the @entity15
while some execs saw his lying as ' quirks ' of his personality , the tales left @entity4 ' incensed ' and he ultimately did n't support @entity293 in february
after he was accused of lying , @entity0 wondered if he had a brain tumor
but other @entity5 employees said @entity0 had always been out of his depth because of his lack of experience and *disinterest* in ' hard ' news
