by @entity0 published : 16:23 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 16:36 est , 14 march 2014 @entity2 discarded a system of security alarms alerting them to their landmark data breach , which left over 40 million customers vulnerable to credit card theft and identity fraud , garnered the department store more than 90 lawsuits and is expected to cost them billions of dollars in ongoing damage control			1
new information obtained by @entity13 on thursday has shown the @entity15 ' no. 3 retailer detected potentially malicious activity during last year 's hack but that staff declined to take immediate action			1
the online attack started sometime before @entity21 2013 , when hackers were able to install malware - malicious software - onto @entity2 's central security system , which was designed to steal every credit card transacted at the company 's 1,797 @entity15 stores			1
the stolen information was being stored on a special server , and at a certain point - likely to be after the holiday shopping spike - the hackers would export all of it out of the database and into their control			0
was it preventable ? the credit cards of over 40 million @entity2 customers were said to have been compromised by last years data breach , which was designed to attack all 1,797 @entity15 stores			1
while security technology picked up the hack , it was not enough for @entity15 officials to put a stop to it however @entity2 was prepared for such a scam , according to @entity47 , and had installed a $ 1.6 million malware detection system six months earlier			1
made by computer security firm @entity50 ( @entity52 ) , which also services the @entity53 and the @entity54 , the system was manned around - the - clock by a security team in @entity57 , @entity58			1
if @entity60 noticed anything suspicious , they would immediately notify @entity2 's security operations center in @entity63			1
on saturday november 30 , the hackers began moving the stolen credit card numbers to ' staging points ' spread across the @entity15 - in order to cover their tracks - before redirecting the data to their own computers in @entity73			2
@entity57 realized the breach and contacted @entity2 headquarters , however the officials in @entity63 overlooked the warnings			1
some 40 million credit card numbers and 70 million addresses , phone numbers and other pieces of personal information were then successfully extracted from the @entity2 mainframe			2
it is not known what happened inside @entity2 for the sirens to be ignored , however computer experts say the company was likely to receive hundreds of such alerts on a daily basis			1
on friday , company spokeswoman @entity91 acknowledged the company declined to act early enough			0
@entity50 is a sophisticated computer security company used by both the @entity53 and the @entity54			1
the @entity52 system @entity2 were using at the time picked up the malicious activity , however @entity15 did not immediately act upon it ' with the benefit of hindsight , we are investigating whether if different judgments had been made the outcome may have been different , ' @entity91 said in a statement			1
two security experts who advise organizations in responding to cyber attacks and both have experience using @entity50 technology said that security personnel typically do n't get excited about such generic alerts because @entity50 does not provide much information about those threats			1
' they are bombarded with alerts			0
they get so many that they just do n't respond to everything , ' said @entity117 , an executive with @entity118 ' it is completely understandable how this happened			0
' @entity121 , owner of @entity122 , said that it was easy to paint @entity2 as being incompetent , given the severity of the breach , but that it was not fair to do so			2
' @entity2 is a huge organization			0
they probably get hundreds of these alerts a day , ' he said			0
' we can always look for someone to blame			0
sometimes it just does n't work that way			0
' @entity2 chief financial officer @entity132 told a congressional committee in february that the company only began investigating after on december 12 , when the @entity135 warned the company about suspicious activity involving payment cards			2
within three days , nearly all the malicious software had been removed from @entity2 's cash registers , he said			1
' through our investigation , we learned that after these criminals entered our network , a small amount of their activity was logged and surfaced to our team , ' @entity91 said			0
' that activity was evaluated and acted upon			0
some 40 million credit and debit card accounts were affected by the data breach that happened between nov. 27 and dec. 15 - just as the holiday shopping season was getting into gear ' based on their interpretation and evaluation of that activity , the team determined that it did not warrant immediate follow up			1
' @entity2 shares fell 2 percent to $ 59.86 in late afternoon trading on the @entity160 after the company released the statement			2
some 40 million payment card records were stolen from the retailer , along with 70 million other records with customer information such as addresses and telephone numbers			0
@entity169 is investigating the breach along with lapses at other retailers , and credit card companies were pushing for better security			0
@entity2 also faces dozens of potential class - action lawsuits and action from banks that could seek reimbursement for millions of dollars in losses due to fraud and the cost of card replacements			2
a spokesman for @entity50 declined to comment			0
@entity50 shares were up 1.8 percent at $ 79.05 on @entity185			2
representatives for the @entity187 and @entity188 , which are investigating @entity2 's breach , declined to comment			1
@entity50 has a function that automatically deletes malicious software , but it had been turned off by @entity2 's security team before the hackers ' attack , the @entity47 report said , citing two people who audited @entity50 's role after the breach			1
@entity199 and @entity121 said that the vast majority of @entity50 's customers turn off that functionality because it is known for incorrectly flagging data as malware , which can halt email and web traffic for business users			2
' @entity50 ... is cutting edge , ' @entity121 said			0
' but it takes love and care and feeding			0
you have to watch it and monitor it			0

@entity2 installed a $ 1.6 million security system six months before the attack in november
designed by @entity50 , who service the @entity53 and the @entity54 , the software detects malicious activity
was being manned around the clock by an *outpost* in @entity57 , @entity58 , who would notify @entity228 in @entity63 of anything suspicious
@entity57 noticed the breach , but @entity2 's @entity15 security did n't act on it
computer experts say the company would receive hundreds of similar threats each day
the data breach is expected to cost @entity2 billions of dollars in damage control , from lawsuits to the call centers set up to handle complaints
