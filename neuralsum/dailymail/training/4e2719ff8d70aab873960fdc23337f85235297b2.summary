by @entity0 published : 20:05 est , 15 april 2013 updated : 20:05 est , 15 april 2013 opposed : @entity1 and @entity2 voted against the benefits cap working families would have to earn more than £ 41,000 a year to get the same as many living on state benefits if the @entity2 was in charge of the welfare system , the @entity4 claimed last night			1
the government ’s benefit cap – introduced yesterday – limits the amount of money a household can claim in welfare payments to £ 26,000 a year , the before - tax income of the average working family			1
@entity1 ’s party opposes the cap and voted against it in the @entity23 , even though opinion polls show that it is hugely popular with the public			1
official figures , contained in an impact assessment of the policy , show that on average those who will see their benefits capped will lose £ 4,836 a year : about £ 93 a week			1
a working family would need a pre-tax salary of £ 32,000 to match the £ 26,000 a year in state handouts allowed under the cap			1
but if nothing had changed and @entity2 got its way , the benefits claimants hit by the cap would have been given nearly £ 31,000 and a working family would need £ 41,000 before tax to match them			1
@entity43 mps seized on the figures as evidence that @entity2 ’s opposition to welfare reform discriminates against those who work			1
the cap was introduced yesterday in four @entity50 boroughs – @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 – and will be rolled out nationwide from september			0
it does not affect those on disability benefits or anyone working more than 16 hours a week and claiming working tax credits			2
the cap limits will be set at £ 500 a week for couples , with or without children , and lone parent households and at £ 350 a week for households of a single adult with no children			2
@entity68 message : work and @entity70 secretary @entity69 said days of ' outrageous claims giving people incomes far above those of hard - working families are over ' work and pensions secretary @entity69 said : ‘ we have a very clear message : we will provide support to those who need it , but the days of outrageous claims giving people incomes far above those of hard - working families are over			1
’ @entity43 chairman @entity83 said : ‘ conservatives are firmly on the side of people who want to work hard and get on in life			0
‘ unbelievably , @entity2 oppose capping benefits			1
they ’ve got no idea – they want some out - of - work households to be able to claim an average £ 4,800 a year more in benefits than the average working family takes home in wages			1
’ ministers also repeated their claim that the introduction of the benefit was already persuading people to return to work			0
the @entity102 published figures last week showing that the number of families affected by the cap has been cut from 56,000 to 40,000			0
menace : @entity108 was caught driving five different high - powered cars without insurance of these , 8,000 have got a job and another 8,000 have disappeared from welfare rolls			0
critics have claimed the figures are not proof of behavioural change in those affected			0
but @entity102 minister @entity117 said : ‘ i do n’t know how much time [ they ’ve ] spent in @entity120 in recent months , i suspect not very much			0
i ’ve been talking to people who have been implementing these changes , and the very clear message is that this has provided a spur to people , to get them thinking about getting into work , whereas perhaps in the past they have n’t			0
’ mr @entity1 responded to the criticism by saying : ‘ we ’re in favour of a benefit cap but it ’s got to be adjusted regionally			2
’ labour work and pensions spokesman @entity134 said : ‘ ministers have got this so badly wrong that even members of the @entity138 think it will cost more than it saves			0
‘ the truth is the benefits bill is soaring £ 21billion higher than expected because this government is failing to create jobs and the welfare revolution we were promised is descending into chaos			2
’ but business leaders backed the government			0
@entity150 , director general of the @entity151 , said : ‘ the benefits cap establishes a sensible principle , that welfare should not pay more than working			2
‘ it is morally wrong as well as economically damaging to have a benefits system that prices employers out of the market			2
this is a welcome move			0

@entity1 and @entity2 voted against limiting benefits to £ 26,000 a year
@entity69 said days of ' outrageous benefits claims are over '
