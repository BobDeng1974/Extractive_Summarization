by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:27 pm on 21st november 2011 the mother of murdered schoolgirl @entity3 today told the @entity5 of the moment she was given false hope her daughter was alive after a @entity10 phone hacker deleted some of her voicemails			1
@entity13 described her euphoria after calling the schoolgirl 's number and being patched through to her answer phone			1
the mail box had previously been so full that she would only get an automated message			1
' i rang her phone , ' she said			1
' it clicked through onto her voicemail , so i heard her voice			2
' mrs @entity13 described shrieking at her husband : '' she 's picked up her voicemails @entity27 ! she 's alive ! ' despair : @entity13 holds her head in her hand as she gives evidence at the @entity5 at @entity33 's @entity32 today @entity34 : mrs @entity13 sat alongside her husband as she described the way in which she found out her missing daughter 's phone had been hacked by a @entity10 investigator but she was only able to access her daughter 's voicemail because @entity10 investigator @entity41 had hacked into the phone and deleted some messages to make room for more recordings			1
mrs @entity13 was not to discover the truth until july this year after police reopened the investigation into the @entity10 hacking scandal			1
they confirmed that @entity52 's phone had been targeted			1
mrs @entity13 told @entity53 that she did not sleep for three nights after being told what had happened			1
she said the revelation was ' terribly difficult to process			2
' ' you replay everything in your mind and just think , " oh , that makes sense now , that makes sense , " ' she said			2
witnesses : mr and mrs @entity13 arrive with their solicitor @entity64 ( behind in orange coat ) ordeal : the couple talked about their experience during the investigation into the disappearance and murder of her daughter @entity32 hearing : the hacking of @entity3 's phone was one of the most high profile incidents in the scandal murdered : @entity3 was 13 when she was abducted on her way home from school in @entity84 , @entity85 @entity52 went missing in @entity84 , @entity85 , in march 2002 as she walked home from school			1
she was abducted and murdered by car clamper @entity88 , her body only found six months later on @entity90 , in @entity91			2
in the aftermath of her disappearance , her parents underwent intense press scrutiny			2
the discovery that her phone had been hacked by @entity41 was the catalyst for the @entity53 inquiry into press standards			1
the @entity101 were the first witnesses to take the stand where they were asked to outline their experiences during the hunt for their daughter			2
giving an example of press intrusion , mrs @entity13 described how she and her husband were photographed on a private walk to retrace their daughter 's steps seven weeks after @entity52 disappeared			1
three days later a picture of mrs @entity13 touching a ' missing ' poster appeared in the @entity10			1
' we quietly retraced her steps and no - one was around , ' she said			2
' we had put out ' @entity119 ' leaflets and i was checking to see if the right poster was up			2
conduct : @entity123 ( right ) is also giving evidence to the @entity5 today arrivals : mr @entity123 ( front , left ) faces photographers as he arrives at the @entity32 a writer whose phone was hacked after she had a relationship with an mp said press regulation was not ' adequate ' and recommended a more ' complex ' approach			1
@entity134 , a journalist and novelist who described herself as a ' very minor public figure ' , told the inquiry that tabloid newspapers seemed to live in a ' 1950s world '			2
ms @entity134 , former partner of mp @entity140 , said @entity142 's tabloid culture was ' remorseless ' and ' almost infantile '			2
she said the system of regulation needed to change			0
she said she did not think the @entity145 - and its predecessor the @entity147 - were ' adequate '			0
' i do n't think they 're adequate bodies to deal with this kind of problem , ' she told the inquiry			1
' i think it needs to be much more complex			0
' ms @entity134 ( pictured ) said tabloid journalists had forgotten that they dealt with people			0
' the people involved have lost all sense that they are dealing with human beings			0
' ' i think we have a tabloid press which is almost infantile in its attitude towards sex and private life			0
' she added : ' my impression is that tabloid hacks go around like children who have just discovered that their parents have sex and they can not resist taking a peek around the door			1
' ms @entity134 said she was mr @entity140 's partner between 2003 and @entity172 told her that her voicemail had been accessed by @entity41 in april			0
she said hacking had started six weeks after mr @entity140 's 24 - year - old daughter , @entity175 , died - in a skydiving accident in @entity177 - in 2004			0
ms @entity134 said she thought she had been hacked because of her relationship with mr @entity140 - a former @entity180 minister and mp for @entity182 - and was ' collateral damage '			1
she told the judge : ' i was amazed by how shocked i was			0
' ' that was on the thursday , and the following sunday that photo appeared in the @entity10			0
we did not see anyone - they must have taken the photo using a telephoto lens			0
' how on earth did they know we were doing that walk on that day ? it felt like such an intrusion into a really private grief moment			0
' counsel to the inquiry @entity201 suggested that the press was a ' double - edged sword ' for the @entity101 because they needed publicity to help the search for their daughter			0
mrs @entity13 agreed , telling the hearing at the @entity210 in @entity33 : ' you have to remember we were really , really desperate for some information about @entity52			1
' so the press were in a position to be able to help us , and they did get the message out that she was missing , and lots of information came into the police headquarters			0
' but on the other hand , ( there is ) the persistent being asked questions and being doorstepped and everything else that 's associated with it - all the letters that you get requesting books , films , interviews			1
' mr @entity233 said the couple became nervous about leaving their house because of the constant attention from journalists			0
' you really are afraid to open your front door because you are faced with a question , ' he said			1
@entity244 chairman and chief executive @entity243 apologised in person to the @entity101 for the ' totally unacceptable ' hacking of @entity52 's phone , the inquiry heard			1
' it was a very tense meeting ... he was very sincere , ' mrs @entity13 said			1
the couple were asked what they hoped would be the outcome of the inquiry into the hacking scandal			0
mr @entity233 said : ' we would sincerely hope that @entity258 and other media organisations would look very carefully how they procure , how they obtain information about stories			0
obviously , the ramifications are far greater than what appears in the press			0
' inquiry chairman @entity53 thanked the couple for agreeing to give evidence			0
he told them : ' i am very conscious that it is a strain			0
i can only sympathise with both of you for the appalling losses that you have suffered and for the traumas that you have undergone over many years			0
' @entity41 was jailed along with the @entity10 's former royal editor , @entity274 , in january 2007 after they admitted intercepting voicemail messages left on phones belonging to royal aides .			0

@entity13 : i did n't sleep for three nights after hearing phone was hacked
