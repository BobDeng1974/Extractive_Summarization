it has all the elements of a traditional @entity3 dinner from turkey and sprouts to roast potatoes , parsnips and pigs in blankets ... but there 's one big difference			1
this festive feast is served in a hot dog bun			1
the @entity14 is the invention of @entity17 and @entity18 owners of the @entity19 , @entity20 and their head chef @entity21			1
the £ 10 dish has a beef and horseradish sausage in a white roll , topped with pulled buttered turkey , sprouts , bacon and chestnuts with @entity32			2
the structure is then drizzled with homemade gravy the trio developed the idea from the ' @entity37 ' they had been serving as a special every sunday			0
the £ 10 dish consists of a beef and horseradish sausage in a white roll , topped with pulled buttered turkey			2
next a ' sticky mix ' of sprouts , bacon and chestnuts with @entity32 , which helps hold the dish together , is added			0
miniature roast potatoes and honey - roasted parsnips and carrots are then perched on top and three skewers inserted - two with mini @entity54 puddings and stuffing balls and one with a pig in a blanket			1
the whole structure is then drizzled in hearty homemade gravy			0
@entity61 roast potatoes , honey - roasted parsnips , carrots , mini @entity54 puddings , stuffing balls and a pig in a blanket complete the rest of the 1,500 - calorie hot dog @entity68 , owner of the @entity19 , serving the @entity3 dog to customer @entity70 mr @entity68 said : ' the @entity14 has been our most popular special by far			1
we 've even had couples coming back especially to order it again			0
' we love making themed dishes and we wanted to create an entire @entity3 dinner in a hot dog but we knew we could n't just chuck the sprouts on			1
' it took a few goes to get right - some of the ingredients are quite high up in the finished structure so it overbalanced a few times until we started using the skewers			0
' mr @entity68 and mr @entity85 have also created a vegetarian version of the dish - a veggie sausage wrapped in seaweed , minus the bacon and pig in a blanket			1
while it sounds fairly gut - busting , mr @entity68 says it 's been popular with men and women alike and is by no means a ' man versus food ' meal			2
he added : ' it 's not especially calorific because it 's not a huge dish , but i 'd guess it contains about 1,500 calories which is the same as the average @entity3 dinner			2
' it 's a manageable portion ; i 's not like you have to force feed yourself			0
most people order a side dish too , like our @entity111 fries			0
' we wanted to try out something christmassy but stay true to our hot dog roots			1
' the dish was added to the menu a couple of weeks ago and we 'll serve it up until we close for @entity3 on the 23rd december			0
' although if people ask for it , i 'm sure we can rustle it up between @entity3 and @entity120			0
