@entity0 has beaten @entity1 to buy drone firm @entity2 in a bid to to bring the internet to the developing world			1
@entity1 had been expected to acquire the firm - but today @entity0 revealed it had pipped them to the post			1
the firm hopes to use the drones to bring internet access to large parts of the developing world , alongside its @entity14 balloon project			2
in april , @entity0 also acquired @entity2 , which is building solar - powered drones ( pictured ) to provide similar connectivity power : @entity2 's drone is covered in around 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 kw of electricity - it flies above the clouds , so it is exposed to sunlight constantly during daylight hours			1
wingspan and payload : 60 metres wide			0
the @entity25 carries a payload of 250 pounds			2
speed : cruising speed for the @entity25 is about 65 mph			2
function : the drone can be used for surveillance , crop - monitoring , weather and disaster oversight - or to provide communication , which is what @entity1 is said to be interested in			2
distance : the unmanned craft will have an operating range of over 2.8 million miles			0
' it 's still early days , but atmospheric satellites could help bring internet access to millions of people , and help solve other problems , including disaster relief and environmental damage like deforestation , ' a @entity0 spokesman said in a statement			1
the firm has not said how much it paid for the firm , which will remain in @entity51			0
@entity2 is developing two dragonfly - shaped drones , both of which use batteries charged by wing - mounted solar panels to remain aloft at night			1
the smaller model , called the @entity25 50 , has a wingspan of 164 feet , slightly larger than a @entity59 767			1
the firm 's drones can fly for upto five years at a time			1
it had previously been reported @entity1 was about to buy the firm			0
the company was said to be interested in using the @entity25 model , which is light - weight solar - powered and can fly at 65,000 feet for five years non-stop			1
the @entity25 unmanned aircraft is 60 metres wide and self - sufficient as it is covered in around 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 @entity69 of electricity			1
as it flies above the clouds , it is exposed to sunlight constantly during daylight hours and store energy for the night flight			0
the drones are described as ‘ atmospheric satellites ’ that could be used for surveillance , to monitor weather and communications			0
the smaller model , called the @entity25 50 , has a wingspan of 164 feet , slightly larger than a @entity59 767			2
@entity1 is interested in the latter function and reportedly thinks the drones could be used to provide sustainable regional internet systems			0
however , this would mean all its drones would be used for the @entity90 project , which is competing with @entity0 ’s ‘ @entity14 ’			2
@entity0 ’s effort plans on using balloons instead of drones to bring internet access to rural and remote areas of the world - and nwill now include the @entity2 drones			1
the @entity25 unmanned aircraft 9pictured ) is 60 metres wide and self - sufficient as it is covered in around 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 kw of electricity experts have pointed out that @entity1 ’s recent acquisition of @entity102 could be used to send messages in places with a weak and slow internet connection , while a data compression technology it bought , @entity108 , could be used so that functions need less transmitted data to make them work			1
while @entity1 ’s aim is altruistic , the company would also seem to be looking to the future , as by connecting communities , more people than ever before will get hooked on social media			0
@entity2 ’s @entity118 and @entity119 60 drones are currently demonstrator models that can be flown and are launched in catapult , but commercial versions are expected next year			1
they are designed to be cheaper than the cost of a satellite , while carrying out similar functions such as surveillance , crop - monitoring , weather and disaster oversight			0
the drones ( pictured ) are described as ' atmospheric satellites ' that could be used for surveillance , to monitor weather and communications			0
@entity1 is interested in using them to provide internet access to remote areas of land below the @entity138 's deputy president , professor @entity137 , said : ' the idea of using aerial platforms to deliver connectivity is one that is many decades old , from low - orbital satellites to balloons and more recently unmanned aerial vehicles			1
' ' the difficultly has always been one of keeping the aerial platform in the right place in the sky for weeks or months at a low enough cost			0
as technologies mature we get ever closer to achieving this			0
' he warned that there are many challenges to overcome before the dream of providing internet access to remote communities via drone can be achieved			0
' top of the list is the need to make the drones cost - effective , reliable and demonstrate to the regulators that they can operate safely in our airspace			2
' many other issues associated with access to radio spectrum , national telecoms regulations and more will also need to be addressed , ' he added .			0

@entity2 developing a range of drones long flying drones
the @entity25 drone is *lightweight* and solar - powered so it can fly at 65,000 feet for five years non-stop
expected to fly in areas @entity0 's balloons can not cover
