a @entity1 patient has become the first in the world to be given a total skull replacement			1
during a 23 - hour operation the 22 - year - old woman was given a @entity7 printed plastic skull			1
the customised skull was implanted by neurosurgeons dr @entity11 and dr @entity12 at @entity13			2
a 22 - year - old woman in the @entity1 has become the first person in the world to have the whole of the back of the skull replaced with a 3d printed version ( pictured ) the patient , who has not been named , suffered from a condition which caused her skull to become progressively thicker			1
this caused her to suffer from headaches and put increased pressure on the brain			2
in this patient ’s case , it was also causing her eyesight to deteriorate and she was losing the ability to form facial expressions			1
her skull was almost five inches thick while a normal skull is about one to one and a half centimetres thick			0
as her skull continued to thicken , the pressure on her brain continued to build and , without the surgery , she would have eventually lost crucial brain functions and died			1
the surgery saw neurosurgeons replace the whole of the back of her skull - from her hairline to the top of her neck and from one ear to the other			0
dr @entity11 carried out the surgery on the patient who had a condition which caused her skull to get progressively thicker , meaning pressure was put on her brain			1
the surgery ( pictured ) was so successful that the patient is now symptom - free and has returned to work they replaced the bone with the plastic implant which was attached to the remaining bone			2
the surgery went well and , three months on , the patient is completely symptom - free			0
she has also fully regained her sight and has returned to work			0
she is not expected to need further treatment			0
dr @entity11 said : ‘ it is almost impossible to see that she ’s ever had surgery			0
’ doctors have previously used @entity7 printed implants to replace parts of the skull – but they have never before replaced the full back part of a skull			2
the surgeons say the technique could also be used to treat patients with severe skull injuries or tumours .			0

woman had a condition that caused her skull to get progressively thicker
this meant pressure was being put on her brain causing headaches
she was also losing her sight and ability to form facial expressions
she would eventually have lost vital functions and died without surgery
neurosurgeons in the @entity1 made her a new plastic @entity7 printed skull
implanted it during a 23 - hour operation at @entity13
the patient , 22 , has now recovered fully and returned to work
