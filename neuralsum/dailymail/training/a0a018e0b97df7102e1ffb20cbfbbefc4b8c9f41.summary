no team has more @entity2 points in 2015 than @entity4 and @entity5 ’ team have been on a roll			1
they ’ve lost just once since the end of november , have @entity9 back and go into tomorrow ’s game at home to @entity12 just two points off the top four			1
but thursday night ’s penalty shootout defeat in @entity16 by @entity17 was a huge blow			1
it ’s a knock to their confidence at a crucial time while , for the first time , the @entity25 winners qualify for the @entity27 , a competition @entity4 need to be in			2
@entity5 has done an excellent job in recent weeks , but now he needs to keep his team positive @entity5 talks to his team before the penalty exit against @entity17 on thursday night in @entity16 so as his weary players returned from the 4,400 - mile round trip to @entity34 just 48 hours before facing @entity12 , this is arguably @entity5 ’ biggest task of the season			1
@entity4 are great when they are on a roll but when they hit a road block we ’ve seen that the wheels can come off			1
@entity5 ’ team have shown a mental weakness in adversity before , their season starts to unravel and they ca n’t let that happen again			1
it would not be a disaster if they lose to @entity12 , who will be desperate to close the gap on @entity52 to three points			1
but if they do , @entity5 needs to teach his team to move on quickly			2
last season they crumbled after their 16 - game unbeaten run ended , throwing away a two - goal lead at @entity60 a few days later to surrender the title			2
that sort of collapse must not happen again and it is up to @entity5 to ensure that			2
last season , after @entity65 capitalised on @entity67 's slip , @entity4 fell off the pace in the title race throwing away a lead at @entity60 ended @entity4 's title ambitions as they crumbled under pressure defeat to @entity17 will leave the squad shaken , but @entity5 must ensure they do not suffer the same fate he is such an impressive , innovative , tactical manager			1
he ’s made 3 - 5 - 2 look like a good system while @entity76 has struggled with it			0
he switched to it to get more of the ball in midfield after teams started pressing @entity67 and stopping them play			0
now his team are bossing possession again			0
he now has two sitting midfield players and two attacking ones in front , usually @entity87 and @entity88			0
it ’s very difficult to play against those two tiers of midfield			0
but management is as much about knowing how to control what ’s going on between your players ’ ears , helping them bounce back from adversity			1
one of his big strengths seems to be creating a feelgood factor			0
you see pictures from @entity103 of the players laughing and joking at training and that positive atmosphere carries onto the pitch			0
he has done trememdously well to turn @entity4 ’s season around following a slow start and the seismic blow of losing @entity112			1
@entity113 has returned to form , but by publicly dropping him @entity5 did the wrong thing after teams started closing down @entity67 , @entity5 has shown his ability by changing systems he has got more out of @entity88 in his new role and drafted in the exciting @entity120 , although it is frustrating that he is cup - tied from his time at @entity123 because no - one at @entity125 put a clause in his loan contract			1
the manager ’s tactical nous and work on the training ground are his big strengths but you also have to say the right things to make your players walk on air			0
i was unsure that saying @entity113 would be out of the team ‘ indefinitely ’ earlier in the season was the right move			0
it might have taken weeks for @entity113 to recover from that and he admitted that it was his wife , not the manager , who helped him get over it			0
maybe @entity5 needs to work on his managerial skills a bit , to make his players feel great when things are n’t going so well			2
@entity5 has done brilliantly to bring the best out of @entity153 playmaker @entity152 in the new system some of the @entity4 summer signings , including @entity156 , have been disappointing all season if they want another season in the @entity27 , now is the time @entity4 have to show their class but not everything has been perfect			1
why were @entity156 and @entity163 brought in when they do n’t fit the @entity5 mould of closing down the opposition and working hard ? and what has happened to @entity168 , who has gone from @entity170 starter to in and out the @entity4 team and is a shadow of his former self ? the same can be said of @entity174 , a £ 20m signing from @entity175 who has started just one @entity2 game since the 3 - 0 defeat by @entity179 in december			1
he was lauded as one of the best defenders in the @entity27 last season but he is now also far from his best			0
he ca n’t have become bad overnight			0
@entity4 are the form team but nothing less than @entity27 qualification will do			2
it would be an astonishing achievement			0
every thursday i ’ll answer your questions live on @entity191			0

@entity4 have been on an excellent run , but thursday 's defeat was a blow
last season , after great form , @entity4 collapsed to lose the title
@entity5 has shown his ability , but must now keep spirits up
starting against @entity12 on *sunday* , they must bounce back
