the latest culprit is @entity11 @entity10 reporter @entity9 whose @entity13 comment comparing @entity14 and women generated a huge backlash on tuesday			1
@entity13 followers smashed @entity18 for saying : ‘ given women generally women struggle to read maps it ’s a little ironic the voice on the @entity22 given ( sic ) directions is a women			1
’ a hashtag saying ‘ confused ’ was attached			0
it was all supposed to be a bit of harmless banter on @entity13 but @entity11 @entity10 reporter @entity9 soon found himself in hot water mr @entity18 joked about women 's voices being used in @entity14 it did not go down well @entity32 felt @entity9 should use a self monitoring compass @entity35 wondered out loud who would be the @entity10 journalist to replace him ? if he wanted a response he got one as @entity13 followers lined up to give him stick			1

@entity49 said : ' i 'm sorry what is the joke here ? is it ' women are stupid ' ? is that your joke ? is that what you are saying ? ' mr @entity18 tries to set the record straight and show that he was only joking unfortunately @entity49 still ca n't work out what was so funny in the first place as far as @entity63 was concerned it was just the same old story an incredulous @entity49 later continued : ' i do n't understand why this is funny			1
could you explain it to me ? ' @entity63 was more to the point saying : ' another day , another sports journalist being a sexist d * * * head			0
' mr @entity18 then tried to justify his actions by tweeting : ‘ to those who clearly did n’t understand that tweet about the sat nav it was tongue in @entity75			2

@entity11 @entity10 reporter @entity9 got into some trouble on @entity13
his joke that women 's voices should not be used on @entity14 as they ca n't read maps did not go down well
@entity18 tried to defend himself by saying it was all ' tongue in cheek ' , although a hashtag with ' nannystate ' was attached
' @entity9 , @entity9 , @entity9 ... have you no self monitoring compass ? we 'll be back to you with your sanction , ' one @entity13 user said
@entity18 finally removed the two tweets as they were ' insensitive ' and did n't come across as he had intended
