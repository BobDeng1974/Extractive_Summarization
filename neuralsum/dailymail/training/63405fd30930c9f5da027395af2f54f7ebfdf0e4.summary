@entity0 has joked that he will pay for @entity1 to enjoy a spa session in hope that the @entity5 driver will ‘ do the impossible ’ and finish ahead of @entity6 at the season - ending @entity7			1
@entity0 will start the final race of the campaign from pole position after blowing away @entity6 at the @entity11 on saturday			1
but in order to emulate his father @entity14 and be crowned world champion , @entity0 needs @entity16 team - mate @entity6 to finish outside the top - two			1
if he finishes there he will be crowned the 2014 @entity18 champion speaking after qualifying , a jovial @entity0 said : ‘ i am sure it is going to be a great battle between the two of us , but i hope for more than that			2
‘ i am paying for a wellness night for @entity1 , a spa session , all - inclusive , hoping that he can be in extra special form and do the impossible tomorrow			2
' @entity1 said he got his perfect lap together , so there was n’t anything else in that			0
of course it would have been great if somehow there could have been a @entity5 between the two of us , but that can always happen tomorrow			0
' @entity6 was the best part of four tenths of a second slower than @entity0 despite appearing to hold the advantage over his team - mate during the early part of qualifying			1
@entity0 will be relying on @entity1 ( pictured ) or indeed @entity52 to finish ahead of @entity6 on sunday @entity18 supremo @entity53 embraces @entity6 ahead of saturday 's qualifying session but the @entity56 driver , who is bidding to claim his first title in six years , made a number of errors during the top - 10 shootout and never troubled his rival			1
' i generally did n’t have the best of laps but it was still a really good qualifying session , i really enjoyed it and the car was fantastic , ' he said			0
' of course you always want to be on pole , that ’s what we work for			0
i ’ve had very good pace throughout practice and particularly the long runs which is comforting			0
' i did n’t really put a comfortable lap together but it was n’t really lots of mistakes or anything , it just was n’t a great lap. @entity79 did a great job but we ’re still there for the fight tomorrow			0

@entity0 starts the @entity7 from pole ahead of @entity6
@entity1 will line up behind the @entity16 pair and @entity0 hopes he can spring a *surprise* and *challenge* @entity6
@entity0 is *17* points behind @entity6 , who needs to finish 2nd to win title
