an aspiring model who was told she was too short for the catwalk spent has thousands of pounds having her legs surgically lengthened			1
from the age of 14 , @entity5 from the city of @entity7 , in south - western @entity4 , wanted to be a model			1
but being just 5.4ft ( 165cm ) she was nowhere near the 6ft ( 183cm ) needed			2
so she decided to work and save up money to have radical surgery to make her legs longer			1
@entity5 , from @entity4 , paid £ 6,000 for leg extension surgery because her 5 ' 4 " frame meant she was too short to be a model			1
her legs grew by 6cm ( 2.4 inches ) in nine months			1
she is pictured before ( left ) and after ( right ) the procedure ms @entity5 had the operation - which involved attaching cages to both her legs , with screws turned daily to stretch them ( pictured ) - in order to fulfil her teenage dream of being a model ms @entity5 , now 30 , was turned down by a modelling agency when she was 17			1
she began researching procedures to stretch her legs at that point , working to save up the money for the operation she said : ' i had tried to get into modelling school when i was 17			2
' but i was told by the director that because i had stopped growing - and the only way i would ever be the right height was if i grew leg extensions			1
' so that 's exactly what i decided to do			0
' at first my parents were really against it			0
my mum is only 5.2ft ( 158cm ) and my dad 5.5ft ( 168cm ) so we are a family of shorties			0
' but i had read about something called the @entity48 apparatus which lengthens bones and that the @entity51 high jump champion @entity52 had had this done in 1968			0
' so i decided to work and save up money to have the operation done			0
the @entity57 apparatus method describes a procedure used to lengthen or reshape limb bones			0
it is named after the orthopedic surgeon @entity48 from the @entity62 , who pioneered the technique			0
as part of the procedure , the bone is surgically fractured			0
as the patients recovers , the fractured bone beings to grow together			0
a cage is attached , which has a screw which is turned four times daily , stretching the leg by a milimeter a day			1
the procedure carries complications including severe pain , swelling , joints contracting and muscle transfixion , where the muscles are divided out from the bone			0
' seeing that i was so determined , my parents gave in and agreed to support me			0
' turning down a place at university , ms @entity5 , who is now 30 , went to work as an assistant for her engineer father until she saved up the £ 6,000 needed			1
the surgery involved surgically fracturing her legs and fitting a metal cage known as a ring apparatus to each leg			1
as she recovered , the fractured bone began to grow together			0
but while it was growing , ms @entity5 had to turn a screw on each cage four times a day , moving the healing fracture apart by approximately one milimeter a day			1
over time , this meant her leg stretched by 6cm ( 2.4 inches )			1
she said : ' the first operation went really well and in nine months i grew by 6cm			1
' i am now planning two more operations in the next couple of years and by 2018 i will be 6ft			2
ms @entity5 plans to have another two surgeries , aiming to be 6ft tall ( 183 cm ) by 2018			1
she said : ' i 'll probably be told i 'm too old to be a model by then , but i 'll dye my hair blonde and at least i will look and feel like one ' ' i 'll probably be told i 'm too old to be a model by then , but i 'll dye my hair blonde and at least i will look and feel like one			2
' the procedure , known as the @entity48 apparatus method , carries complications including severe pain , swelling , joints contracting and muscle transfixion , where the muscles are divided out from the bone			0
ms @entity5 's story follows that of 21 - year - old @entity118 , from @entity119 , whose story was reported by @entity121 in march 2014			2
ms @entity122 underwent the same type of surgery as ms @entity5 , in order to extend one of her legs - which was stunted			1
she had suffered a bone infection when she was a child and due to poor medical facilities in her hometown , her thigh bone was eroded by bacteria			0
this left her left leg nine inches ( 23cm ) shorter than her right and meant she had to walk with the aid of crutches for most of her life			2
ms @entity138 had four operations in total between october 2012 and october 2013			0
her left leg was extended by a huge nine inches ( 23cm ) and her left knee joint and left hip joint were replaced			2
her treatment finished at the end of february 2014 and doctors said she would be able to walk normally for the first time , after a few months of rehabilitation .			0

@entity5 , 30 , was told at 17 she was too short to be a model
