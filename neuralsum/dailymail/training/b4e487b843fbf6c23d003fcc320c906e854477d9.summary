by @entity0 last updated at 12:45 am on 30th november 2011 after twice failing to attend court to answer an allegation against her , @entity4 produced what she thought were her @entity7 cards			1
but the letters she claimed were from her gp and employer explaining why she was not at the hearings were less than convincing			1
the note said to be from dr @entity14 had no letterhead , was clumsily written in capitals and , most obviously , was littered with spelling mistakes – such as , ‘ @entity18 ’ and ‘ a , @entity19 ’			1
bogus : a clumsily written extract from the ' gp 's letter ' @entity21 worker @entity4 forged and handed in to court officials to explain why she had n't been to earlier hearings @entity25 was jailed for three months at @entity26 after admitting perverting the course of justice one purporting to be from her boss at a @entity21 outlet was just as bad , referring to ‘ prove ’ instead of proof and ‘ bussiness ’ [ sic ]			1
basic checks confirmed they were fakes			1
she is now beginning a three - month jail term after admitting attempting to pervert the course of justice , even though she was eventually cleared of the original allegation that she breached a community order			2
sentencing her at @entity26 , judge @entity41 said : ‘ you actively intended to deceive the court			2
what you sought to do was deceive and lie			2
’ @entity25 , 41 , was due to appear before @entity47 magistrates in @entity26 on august 25 for allegedly breaching her order			2
imposed for stealing £ 4,000 from her supervisor ’s office at a co-op store in june 2009 , it involved 160 hours of unpaid work at a charity shop			0
a warrant for her arrest was issued when she failed to turn up for the hearing , and she was brought before the court on september 9			0
@entity25 , of @entity26 , said she had been involved in a fatal road crash , and was granted an adjournment to obtain evidence to confirm her story			0
no show : miss @entity4 had failed to attend @entity68 on two occasions when she gave in the forged notes the shift supervisor breached the order again the following month , and on september 22 missed another court appearance			1
a warrant was again issued , leading to her appearing before magistrates a week later			0
but she still did not have the evidence she had offered to provide and the case was put off until october 6			0
it is understood she then gave reasons for the breaches that were accepted			0
the @entity83 refused to say what she claimed was wrong with her , but a source said it was of a ‘ delicate nature ’			0
however , the authenticity of the notes was immediately questioned by the magistrates ’ legal adviser and @entity25 ’s surgery and employer , both based in the town , were then contacted			1
@entity96 , defending , said : ‘ she accepts her behaviour was short - sighted , misguided , foolish			0

@entity21 worker forged notes from boss and her gp
' i was *stupid* . i hold my hand up to it . i am so scared of going to *prison* and thought if i handed in the letter it would buy a bit of time '
