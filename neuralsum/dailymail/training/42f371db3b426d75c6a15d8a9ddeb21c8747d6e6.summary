by @entity0 published : 14:40 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 18:07 est , 11 february 2013 forty fish have died in the cold after a council stored them in an old skip during repair work to a pond			1
@entity7 and @entity8 transferred the fish to a temporary home inside a rubbish skip , but the water was not kept fresh enough			1
the @entity13 said it had warned the council to move the fish to a more suitable container after finding them stored in skips			1
the @entity13 has criticised the council for not providing adequate alternative storage up to 1000 fish had been stored in an old skip while the pond was prepared there were coy carp , goldfish and perch being stored in the skips in the cold weather the council is now working with the @entity13 to ' learn valuable lessons for the future '			1
the fish were among about 1,000 which lived in @entity7 's @entity33 pond			1
strategic director for @entity7 , @entity35 , said : ' this is a very regrettable situation			2
' unfortunately we have lost some fish in the course of the urgent repair works to the park and pond - around 40			2
' we thought we had made good plans and preparations for temporarily storing the fish on - site in specially - insulated skips which were specifically chosen as they are hard to vandalise			0
@entity7 and @entity8 was administering repair works to the pond when the fish died ' however freezing weather meant we could n't refresh the water regularly without causing an ice hazard on the path and cycle track nearby			1
' we have been in contact with the @entity13 , to review what happened and have learnt some valuable lessons for the future			0
' staff are very upset as they are keen conservationists and would never have wanted this			0
' at the beginning of january the pond began undergoing repairs for the first time in two decades			0
it was being drained after springing a leak			0
it is believed that when the temperature dropped the water in the skips was not being oxygenated which led to several fish perishing			0
an @entity13 spokesman said : ' the @entity13 was called by a concerned member of the public who had seen dead fish floating in the skips			1
' we contacted the council and told them that they were not providing a suitable environment for the fish and arrangements were made to move the remaining fish to a nearby facility with ponds			2
' we did not have enough evidence to prosecute the council but are assisting them with their inquiries into what went wrong			0
' the pond had perch , coy carp and goldfish living in it .			0
