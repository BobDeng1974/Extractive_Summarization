by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 15:07 est , 27 september 2013 he loves to show off his penchant for all things fashion but @entity5 's forays into design have n't previously met with success			2
now the rapper hopes to make a comeback and has reportedly enlisted @entity11 's former creative director @entity10 to help him make it in the cutthroat industry			1
@entity5 has previously worked with @entity14 on the stage looks for his last tour , which included ' seventies - centric pantsuits , cutaway coats and gilded jeans ' return : @entity5 , pictured backstage at his last fashion show in 2011 , is apparently set to stage a comeback partnership : according to reports , @entity5 has signed up former @entity11 designer @entity10 the controversial ' @entity25 ' star has n't presented his clothing on the catwalk since 2011 , when he showcased his spring / summer 2012 and autumn / winter 2012 debut collections to lukewarm reviews			1
more recently , the rapper indulged in a spat with @entity33 , who , claimed @entity5 , had ' stolen ' his designs , including leather jogging trousers			0
@entity5 has yet to reveal whether his label will continue , but reports have been circulating for months about his big return to the runway and his ambitions recently received a fillip after a nine - piece collection in collaboration with @entity44 sold out within hours			0
fashionable couple : @entity5 with girlfriend @entity46 who also boasts a clothing collection pedigree : @entity14 used to work for @entity11 , which showed a new collection in @entity51 yesterday and it would appear that @entity5 has had a return to the catwalk under his own name on his mind for a considerable period of time			1
earlier this month , a job ad on @entity59 , a website used as a networking tool by professionals , claimed to be searching for the future vice president and chief financial officer for the as yet unnamed ' @entity5 clothing project '			0
the post read : ' the venture will be very high profile , and unlike those in which celebrities merely lend their name to a label , this venture will have the power of mr. @entity5 's creative genius at the heart and soul of it			0

the *outspoken* rapper 's first foray into fashion took place in 2011 in @entity51
the a / @entity85 collection fell foul of fashion *critics* and he has done little since
now he is *alleged* to have hired former @entity11 boss @entity10
