a building society illegally ramped up interest rates for thousands of its buy - to - let customers on a ‘ whim ’ to boost its coffers , a court heard yesterday			1
@entity6 is accused of ripping off landlords with tracker mortgages by increasing their rates by two percentage points without warning			1
tracker mortgages are supposed to follow the @entity14 ’s base rate , which has remained at an historic low of 0.5 per cent for almost six years			0
@entity17 been taken to @entity18 ( pictured ) accused of illegally ramping up interest rates for thousands of its buy - to - let customers but the building society shocked customers when they ramped up their rates in december 2013 , pushing some from 1.99 per cent above the base rate to 3.99 per cent			1
customers were told their rate had been hiked because of ‘ market conditions ’ and to ensure it was running its business ‘ prudently efficiently and competitively ’			0
but property investor @entity29 , who took out a mortgage with @entity32 in 2008 , objected and has now taken the case to the @entity18 on behalf of 350 other disgruntled landlords			0
the changes are believed to have affected 6,200 customers , but the outcome of the court case could have implications for tens of thousands of buy - to - let landlords on similar contracts with other lenders			1
mr @entity29 said their tracker rates should be protected under the terms of their mortgage agreement			0
but the building society said they were able to override these ‘ personalised ’ terms and activate their standard mortgage offer conditions which , they claim , granted them the right to vary a tracker rate if they felt it was necessary			1
@entity6 is accused of ripping off landlords with tracker mortgages by increasing their rates by two percentage points without warning an avalanche of complaints to the @entity61 followed and 356 of the building society ’s customers , including mr @entity29 , formed the @entity65 action group and commenced legal proceedings			1
yesterday , @entity67 , representing the claimants , told mr @entity69 that the building society ’s actions were unfair and that the clauses in the mortgage contracts used to justify the rate hikes are ‘ inconsistent ’			1
the court heard that when mr @entity29 , an investor with a string of buy - to - let properties , entered into the mortgage , he believed it was a fixed rate of 6.29 per cent for four years , followed by a tracker at base rate plus 1.99 per cent until the end of the mortgage term			1
he was shocked when he received the letter telling him the 1.99 per cent rate would go up to 3.99 per cent and outraged when they referred him to a clause in their standard mortgage conditions , stating any unfixed mortgage rate ‘ may be varied by ( us ) at any time ’ , in a similar way to a standard variable rate			0
mr @entity67 said the so - called standard terms now relied upon by the building society had been merely ‘ grafted on ’ to the personal terms of the offers , and should not now be allowed to carry more legal weight			1
outside court , mr @entity67 warned that if the building society won the case , it could give them the green flag to do the same to residential mortgages			2
@entity67 , representing the claimants , warned : ‘ they are saying they can just move the rate to make themselves solvent , and residential mortgages will be next			0
’ but the building society said consumers were not subject to the same terms and conditions and insisted this would not happen			2
the @entity32 claimed it had only used its discretion to vary the tracker rate for customers who own a portfolio of three or more buy - to - let properties			1
@entity124 , for the building society , defended the decision to up the rate for mr @entity29 , 47 , and his wife @entity127 , 41 , plus thousands of others			2
he said the building society ’s right to vary the interest rate ‘ was repeatedly made clear in the documents sent to mr @entity29 ’			2
the barrister also said the move had been reviewed by the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) which had so far backed the building society in every complaint from the action group			2
he insisted that the claimants are not trapped in their mortgages , as they have the option to pay their loans off early at any time , with one month ’s notice ‘ the mortgage could be terminated early either by the claimant or the defendant ... if the claimant did not like the margin as varied , ’ he said			0
but he confirmed outside court that millions of others could potentially endure similar ‘ whimsical ’ rate increases from their own providers should the @entity32 win the case			0
mr @entity153 said after the hearing : ‘ if we win our case then , going forward , if people have tracker mortgages under the same terms , then other mortgage providers could do the same as us			0
’ the court heard that the interest rate hike has now been reduced from 2 per cent to 1.5 per cent			0
