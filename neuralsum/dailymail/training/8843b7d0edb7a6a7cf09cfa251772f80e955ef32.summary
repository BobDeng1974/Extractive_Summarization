by @entity0 spoiled teen @entity1 may have abandoned her controversial legal battle to sue her parents , but she has not given up on her party lifestyle - or the boyfriend her mom and dad banned her from seeing			1
the cheerleader – who made international headlines after she took her parents to court to accuse them of abandoning her – posted a string of pictures on her public @entity14 page last week showing her at a wild high school blowout			1
in some of the snaps - contained in an album called , ' seniors ' - @entity17 , 18 , is seen clutching a plastic cup and in one ‘ action shot ’ she is shown taking a huge swig			1
she had refused to live by their rules which they drew up in response to concerns she was drinking too much smooch : @entity33 , 18 , was pictured in high spirits and kissing boys at the raucous event			1
she was no doubt celebrating the fact that she had secured a $ 56,000 scholarship to college banned : boyfriend @entity41 , far left , was also at the party			1
@entity17 launched the legal action against her parents when they said she could not go out with him if she wanted to live at home the teen is pictured with a number of different boys – planting a kiss on one – but more importantly her boyfriend @entity41 features in one of the images			1
@entity17 ’s parents @entity54 and @entity56 - who have easy access to the snaps - expressly banned her from seeing @entity41 , 18 , after they accused him of leading their daughter astray and making her , ‘ obsessed with drinking every weekend ’			1
in fact her drinking and her relationship with @entity41 were the main reasons for the explosive fall out experienced by the @entity65			0
last november , soon after moving out of the family home in @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity17 sent her father an email saying she was ready to come back			1
@entity54 , a former police chief , responded , writing : ‘ as far as the boyfriend , yeah , you might not agree and sure you do n't but that has been as much a drag on you as anything , if you 're home he 's not around or involved in your life			2
' @entity17 responded ' well i 'm not coming home if i ca n't see him '			1
that was their last correspondence until they met in @entity84 on march 5			0
between those dates @entity17 lived at the home of her best friend ’s father , @entity87 , a high powered lawyer who actually funded her legal battle			1
in the lawsuit , @entity54 and @entity56 were accused of abandoning their daughter and told they needed to pay for her private school tuition , her university fees and her legal bills			0
school run : @entity17 was pictured being seen off to school by her mother @entity56 just days after a judge shared his very dim view of her lawsuit back home : @entity17 's parents have welcomed her back to their @entity67 , @entity68 home , pictured			1
but it was assumed she would then have to tow the line their counter argument centered on @entity17 ’s drinking and her relationship with @entity41			1
in incendiary court papers , @entity56 laid into her daughter , @entity41 and even his parents			0
she wrote : ‘ prior her dating him , @entity17 had been dating another boy through the summer of 2013 where they rarely , if ever engaged in the heavy partying that was being exhibited nonstop in the fall of 2013			2
‘ she ( @entity17 ) was routinely bought home drunk by the @entity121 , well past her curfew … ‘ in ignoring our very lenient rules and curfews , it became the normal fashion on weekends for @entity41 ’ father or mother to drive @entity41 and @entity17 home from whatever party they were able to find around the country			1
’ referencing one particular incident , she said : ‘ on that particular night @entity41 ’ father drove her home drunk and dropped her off at our home at 3.30am			0
’ @entity41 also faced the brunt of the @entity33 family anger when it came to her disciplinary problems at school			0
@entity56 said he was present when @entity17 was suspended from @entity144 , explaining : ‘ upon @entity17 ’s return to school ( following a first suspension ) she cut school with @entity41 and called into school herself purporting to be me			1
‘ on october 29 , 2014 the night before she left , we had told her she could no longer see her boyfriend due to the suspension and his poor influence on her and we took away her phone and car privileges			0
down the hatch : @entity17 was pictured with blurry - eyed friends downing from a plastic cup worse for wear : @entity17 posted a picture of this boy who looked as if he passed out drunk in the yard ‘ upon suspension , she attended work with her father … despite our having imposed a punishment for the suspension she was picked up by her unsupervised and also suspended boyfriend , @entity41 … within an hour of arriving there …			1
she went to the @entity41 ’s home			0
‘ mrs @entity170 contacted me at work stating that she had both @entity17 and her son , @entity41 , at her house and that for the sake of our children , that i needed to contact @entity144 and tell them that @entity17 had my permission to be at her house			2
‘ i vociferously refused to comply with this and indicated to mrs. @entity170 that they needed to be accountable for their actions … ‘ i was attempting to exert moral legal parental authority over daughter despite the enabling and parental interfering behavior of mrs. @entity170 , which undermined our parenting and rules			2
’ those statements led to a war of words between the @entity65 and the @entity121			0
speaking to @entity195 last month @entity41 ’ dad @entity194 said : ‘ my son has been painted in a questionable light by some of the comments from the @entity65			0
' their only experience of him is that he met the father long enough to shake hands			0
that 's the only interaction they have ever had			0
they made their decision about him from that			0
' if you read the court papers you can see the trend is with every boyfriend she 's had it 's always the boyfriend who 's the bad influence			0
we have been dragged into this			0
’ but it seems that bad blood has not changed @entity17 and @entity41 ' feeling towards each other			2
following months of recriminations the case went to court and judge @entity226 made it immediately clear that he was not sympathetic to @entity17 ’s arguments			2
after reading an expletive - laden and vicious answerphone message left by @entity1 to @entity56 , in which the girl said : ' i wan na s * * * all over your face ' , he said : ' have you ever in your experience seen such gross disrespect for a parent ? i do n’t see it in my house			0
’ the judge added that @entity17 had given her mom and dad : ‘ the proverbial f you ’			2
he also warned he must consider the ' slippery slope ' where ' we open the gates for a 12 - year - old to sue for an @entity248 , a 13 - year - old to sue for an @entity249 … what about a 15 - year - old asking for a 60 inch tv ? ' seemingly realizing she was fighting a losing battle @entity17 agreed to move back into her parents ’ house the following week and dropped the lawsuit			1
holding it together : @entity17 did n't look in such a bad state compared to those she was partying with disrespect : the judge overseeing the case asked : ' have you ever seen such gross disrespect for a parent ? i do n’t see it in my house ' after he read a foul answerphone message @entity17 had left her mother but if her @entity14 pictures are anything to go by she has not changed her lifestyle and is still hanging out with @entity41 , something which is sure to anger her parents			1
on top of that it seems she has also got her parents to agree to part - fund her college education , the main reason for launching the lawsuit			1
@entity17 announced on her @entity14 page in a public post on march 29 that she plans to attend @entity281 as a biomedical engineering major on a $ 56,000 scholarship			1
she wrote : ‘ decision made			0
wne u class of 2018 bme major w / 56,000 $ scholarship			2
’ a western @entity289 spokesman confirmed to the @entity290 that @entity33 was accepted into the private school in @entity292			0
in an email to @entity295 , they added : ‘ @entity281 routinely offers merit scholarships to incoming freshmen based on academic achievement			0
... these merit scholarships can total between $ 22,000 and $ 66,000 over the course of four years			0
’ one year of tuition at the school for an undergraduate engineering student is $ 32,606 , and room and board is an additional $ 12,700 , according to the university website .			2
