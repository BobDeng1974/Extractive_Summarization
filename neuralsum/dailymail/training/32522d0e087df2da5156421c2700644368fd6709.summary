the @entity0 has admitted it ' does not have the power to intervene ' in the high - stakes dispute between the @entity3 and the @entity4			1
the very future of the @entity3 national side is up in the air following the squad 's premature abandonment of their three - format tour of @entity11 - a momentous decision that led to the @entity4 initiating legal action against the @entity3 and suspending all future tour agreements between the teams			1
with the financial fragility of the @entity3 - particularly compared to the commercial behemoth that is @entity18 - either a multi-million dollar claim for damages or the loss in revenue associated with @entity23 visits could effectively bury the @entity3 as a going concern			0
@entity11 cricketer @entity25 celebrates taking his wicket of @entity27 in june 2013 but as a result of a controversial governance restructure earlier this year - when the boards of @entity11 , @entity29 and @entity30 effectively seized executive control - the @entity0 has no jurisdiction over the future tours programme			2
as a result , the @entity0 confirmed on wednesday that despite concerns over the row - which is rooted in an internal payment dispute between the @entity44 squad , their players ' association @entity38 and the @entity3 - they have no formal powers of mediation			1
a statement released to @entity48 read : ' the @entity0 ( @entity0 ) said on wednesday it was concerned with the dispute between the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) and the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) , and was closely monitoring the developments arising from the recently cancelled tour of @entity11			2
' the @entity0 hopes that the matter will be resolved amicably , but clarified that , unless the matter is otherwise referred to it , it does not have the power to intervene in disputes resulting from a bilateral @entity58 tour			0
' the @entity0 added that the matter will be discussed at the @entity61 meeting , which is scheduled for 10 november in @entity62			0
until then , the @entity0 will make no further comment on this matter			0
