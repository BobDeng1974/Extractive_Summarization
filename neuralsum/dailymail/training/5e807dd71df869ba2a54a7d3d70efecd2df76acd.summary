by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 are building a ‘ @entity4 hub ’ designed to digest data from all 64 games in @entity7 and turn it into ammunition for @entity10 and his team			1
in what is shaping up to be a tournament with a heavy sports science influence , the @entity12 will use an operational nerve centre at @entity17 , the national football centre , to blend traditional scouting methods with the modern desire for video analysis			1
@entity2 ’s scouting team in @entity7 will include @entity23 , the @entity12 ’s head of talent identification , @entity23 , the @entity12 ’s director of elite development , @entity23 , @entity2 ’s under - 21 manager and scout @entity27			1
say cheese : @entity2 players pose in their suits for their @entity4 team photo before flying out to @entity32 they will study @entity2 ’s potential opponents and compile match reports in the normal manner , noting popular set - piece routines and the strengths and weaknesses of players , before liaising with those at @entity17			1
the @entity12 ’s senior football analyst @entity41 and his assistant @entity42 will control the ‘ @entity4 hub ’ , where they will watch all 64 games played in @entity7 and compile the facts and statistics			1
they will study each game in the company of different football specialists and scouts employed by the @entity12 and the coaches who are based at @entity17			0
this information will then be packaged and sent to @entity10 ’s backroom team in @entity55 and used to enhance @entity2 ’s tactics and strategy in @entity7			2
there is friction developing inside football between the traditionalists , who value the eye and instinct of those steeped in football , and the technophiles who are embracing the masses of data and evidence now available			0
this is the @entity12 ’s bid to carefully combine the two but it is fair to say no @entity2 football team will have embarked on a @entity4 adventure armed with quite so much sports science expertise			1
@entity10 , a traditionalist who is fairly open - minded about the advance of scientific data , will be able to use it to monitor the reaction of his players to the heat - they use heart - rate monitors and gps tracking technology in training - and tactically within games if he wants			2
all aboard : the @entity2 squad have flown to @entity32 to continue their @entity4 preparations even after the tournament , the information gathered at the hub will be used to consider successful trends and strategies in international football , in the same way as a technical report			2
much of this comes into the realm of @entity98 , formerly sir @entity99 ’s right - hand man in @entity2 rugby union and consultant to the @entity102 , who is the @entity12 ’s new head of performance services and will be in @entity7			2
@entity98 ’s brief , according to the @entity12 upon his appointment , was to ‘ create new tournament strategies aimed at increasing success ’			0
@entity23 has described his role in the operation as ‘ pivotal ’			0
@entity99 applauded the idea to employ @entity98 when it was confirmed last year and said : ‘ @entity98 is right up to date with everything going on in sport			0
’ there are two video analysis experts among the support staff for the @entity4 : @entity118 from @entity119 and @entity120 from @entity121			1
coach @entity122 often spends the first half of @entity2 games in the stands studying the video technology and reporting back to @entity10 at half - time			1
@entity2 's itinerary for this summer 's @entity4 in @entity7 the @entity129 stopped clubs installing tv monitors and laptops in the dug - outs , mainly to avoid pressure on officials after slow - motion replays and different camera angles highlifht poor decisions			2
but mobile phone technology is advancing at such a rate that video experts in the stands can quickly and easily send replay clips and statistical information to those sitting on the touchline			0
the trick is to identify the information which is both useful and easily digested			0
@entity2 also have @entity119 ’s sports scientist @entity149 in @entity7 and @entity151 ’s nutritionist @entity150 , who will have an important role because of the high temperatures			0
@entity150 will be expected to keep the players ’ bodies well hydrated and balanced with different minerals and electrolytes using energy bars , supplements , recovery drinks and post-match food .			0

@entity2 are building a ' @entity4 hub ' designed to digest data from every @entity4 match to aid @entity10 's side
the @entity12 will blend traditional scouting methods with video analysis
@entity2 scouting team will include under - 21 boss @entity23
