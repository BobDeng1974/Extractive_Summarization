by @entity1 reporter published : 07:08 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 07:56 est , 10 july 2013 it 's a murder trial involving almost a half - dozen mistresses , a botched investigation at a troubled police department and a missing pickup truck at the heart of the case			0
after a month of testimony , the trial of former @entity11 police officer @entity10 , accused of killing his wife with his service weapon , has become a tale of workplace romances and steamy affairs , including a love triangle at the hair salon where the victim worked			1
in all , four mistresses and a woman who married defendant just after his wife 's death have testified about their trysts with him			1
several of the women were police officers			0
the case also has threatened to further tarnish the reputation of the beleaguered @entity32 , which already is under investigation by the @entity34 over a series of police shootings			2
accused : prosecutors have depicted @entity10 as a philanderer whose marriage was crumbling , and say he killed his wife after she found out he had staged the theft of his pickup truck to collect the insurance proceeds the less - than - perfect crime : @entity44 was killed when her husband allegedly shot her in the mouth and tried to make it look like a suicide the trial included allegations that officers at the scene removed and even flushed key evidence down the toilet			1
@entity10 , 32 , is accused of shooting his 26 - year - old wife , @entity44 , with his department - issued gun in 2007 at their @entity59 home and then trying to make her death look like a suicide			1
prosecutors have depicted @entity10 as a philanderer whose marriage was crumbling , and say he killed his wife after she found out that he had staged the theft of his pickup truck valued at more than $ 20,000 to collect the insurance proceeds			1
the defense says the death was a suicide by a woman unraveling over her failed marriage and relationships			2
@entity10 's lawyer says he could not have killed his wife in october 2007 because he was with another woman at the time			1
@entity44 was also having an affair with an @entity11 police officer who was married to the maid of honor in her wedding , witnesses said			0
they had sex in the back of a hair salon where she worked , according to testimony			0
' this trial is like a mosquito in a nudist colony , ' said @entity90 , owner of the @entity11 - based public relations firm @entity91			0
' where do you begin ? ' the case is nearing the end as defense attorney @entity96 calls final witnesses this week			0
@entity96 , who has long represented clients in high - profile @entity100 homicide cases , was able to convince the judge to bar statements @entity44 made about her husband and his ' cop buddies ' staging the theft of @entity10 's 2004 @entity108 truck as part of an insurance scam			1
now @entity96 is working to show how his client was a victim of a larger effort to paint him as a monster			0
the other side of the law : former @entity11 police officer @entity10 seen here in his mugshot after allegedly murdering his wife ' there has been a persistent @entity120 campaign by the media from the beginning , ' @entity96 told @entity1			2
a key to @entity96 's defense strategy has been to discredit former @entity126 's detective @entity125 , one of the first investigators on the scene who concluded that the death ' looked staged			2
' @entity96 has portrayed @entity125 as a conspiracy theorist unable to hold steady law enforcement jobs in @entity132 and @entity100 as he kept stumbling upon ' nefarious activities ' involving crooked police that were never borne out			0
@entity125 was taken off the investigation into @entity44 's death after calling his supervisors derogatory names			1
he was also in the middle of one of the trial 's more colorful moments when he testified that he believed @entity10 was pretending to cry over his wife 's death during interviews , which he saw as a clue @entity10 might have been involved			1
' if there is no snot , believe him not , ' he testified in a comment that drew immediate comparisons to attorney @entity152 's theatrics during the @entity154 trial			0
but @entity10 and his lawyer suffered an apparent setback last week when a crime scene expert testifying in his defense failed to pull off a demonstration of how the officer 's wife might have been able to kill herself with his gun			1
there was a bullet in the gun 's chamber when it was found next to @entity44 's body , leading prosecutors to argue that she could not have shot herself and then released the magazine			1
protect and serve : @entity10 , left , sits with his attorney at his murder arraignment in the @entity173 @entity172 @entity174 , the expert , suggested that @entity44 held the gun upside down and used her thumb to pull the trigger			1
but @entity174 tried a few times to show jurors that he could pull the trigger and press the gun 's magazine release in one continuous motion , but it did n't work			0
' i ca n't get it to work today , ' he said			0
the failed demonstration drew gasps , smiles and whispers from members of @entity44 's family			1
the investigation also has been criticized since an @entity11 officer , on scene to help @entity10 cope with his wife 's death , cut out a piece of a bloody mattress and had the piece destroyed			1
another officer used a toilet and flushed it before investigators had a chance to examine what may have been blood floating inside			0
in other testimony , a digital forensic investigator with the @entity207 told the jury that an internet search from november 2006 on ' how to kill someone ' was found on @entity10 's computer			2
the testimony from @entity10 's former mistresses included other bizarre details			2
one mistress provided an alibi , and another , who was called to counter the alibi , said that while she was carrying on the affair , she got her hair done by @entity44 at a @entity59 salon			0
another mistress said she and @entity10 had sex in a house he once shared with his wife just a few weeks after the wife was found dead			2
' i think people are more focused on all the drama that the positions of both sides arguing their cases , ' @entity90 said			0
' jurors will have a hard time not to be caught up in that drama			0

both @entity10 and his wife were having *extramarital* affairs at the time of the shooting
the couple was talking about *divorce* prior to @entity44 's death
