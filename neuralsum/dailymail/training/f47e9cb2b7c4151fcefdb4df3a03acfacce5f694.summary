this flow chart reveals the tortuous web of cash transactions made by @entity4 @entity3 in a bid to avoid paying £ 1million in tax			1
it shows how the @entity8 moved his earnings around a string of banks and charitable trusts to claim that he had incurred huge losses as a second - hand car dealer			1
many of the organisations involved in the scheme are based in low - tax and highly private jurisdictions such as @entity21 , the @entity22 and the @entity23			2
head scratcher : this flow chart shows how tax advisers working on behalf of @entity3 advised him to make a complicated series of international transactions in a bid to avoid paying £ 1million in tax but @entity3 now faces a whopping bill after a tax judge said he did not believe the former @entity8 star had been buying and selling used cars			1
he had been using a scheme dubbed ' @entity36 ' , promoted by a firm called @entity38 , which advised their high - earning clients to claim they suffered business losses which could be claimed against their tax bill			1
variants of the scheme , which was used by about 450 clients of the firm , included claiming losses from dealing in other high - value items such as watches or cash receivables			2
a spokesman for @entity51 told @entity52 : ' the scheme is highly artificial and relies on complex rules concerning overseas dividends , which provide for relief on payments which are representative of dividends paid on shares which are loaned to other persons			0
' @entity3 is thought to have earned around £ 700,000 a year from his time presenting the @entity64 breakfast show , which he tried to offset using a tax avoidance scheme popular with high earners a tax tribunal concluded : ' a realistic view of the facts shows that the aim was that the appellants , " as though by magic " , should appear to have incurred vast fees in order to borrow modest amounts of money they did not need in order to invest it in a " trade " they had no desire to pursue			1
' last night @entity3 publicly admitted his ‘ mistake ’ and said he had ‘ learnt a valuable lesson ’			2
but he has fought hard to hush up his use of tax avoidance schemes			1
when it emerged in 2012 he had used the same legal offshore scheme as comedian @entity87 , who was paying as little as 1 per cent , @entity3 claimed it would breach his human rights if he could not keep his membership secret			1
separately , @entity3 , 39 , was one of 450 celebrities , fund managers and other top earners to try to avoid tax by taking part in a scheme called ‘ @entity36 ’			1
it worked by allowing members to say they had incurred huge fees while working in the second - hand car trade , which they could claim back against their tax bill			1
on the self - assessment tax return he filed for the financial year ending in april 2008 , when he was presenting the @entity64 show , he claimed he ‘ had engaged in self - employment as a used - car trader ’			2
he claimed he had made a loss of £ 1million , but the tax tribunal ruled this was just a ruse to save tax			0
the working wheels scheme is reportedly popular with the rich of @entity113 , as it allows people to claim a significant amount of money back off of large earnings it found that , far from being a car dealer , @entity3 had never supplied any vehicles and had ‘ no interest ’ in doing so			1
nor did he have the faintest idea how much the cars he was supposedly trading cost to buy and to sell			0
when @entity51 rejected the scheme , @entity3 and two other members appealed to a tax court			2
yesterday , tax judge @entity128 rejected the appeal , saying it was clear he ‘ entered the scheme for no purpose other than to achieve a tax saving ’			0
he said the ‘ scale of mr @entity3 ’ borrowing was driven solely by the amount of the tax loss he wanted to achieve , in his case £ 1million			2
the ruling said @entity3 was ‘ anxious to be reassured the scheme was lawful , and that he would not have to undertake any trading himself ’			2
@entity3 later took to @entity146 to say : ‘ upon advice , i signed up to a scheme which i was assured was legal			1
my knowledge of the dealings of the scheme were naive			0
i ’m not a tax expert and acted on advice			0
this was a mistake and i accept the ruling without reservation			0
’ the ' working wheels ' tax avoidance scheme , popular with @entity113 's high earners who want to avoid paying their full tax , involves posing as a used car salesman on you tax return form			1
the self - employed person then registers certain losses and costs in the process of running their second - hand car ' business '			1
these registered costs and losses can be stuck off as expenses necessary in the line of running the ' business '			0
in @entity3 ' case , he claimed he had totalled £ 1million of losses during the course of selling £ 3,731 worth of used cars			0
he tried to offset the claimed £ 1million loss in the 2007 - 08 financial year against tax he owed on his other income , his estimated £ 700,000 salary from the @entity64 , funded by the @entity23 public who pay the television license fee			0
@entity3 took to twitter to issue a reply to the news that he had partaken in a tax avoidance scheme but he was not so keen to speak about the case when he still hoped to win it			1
during his year - long battle with the taxman , @entity3 desperately tried to keep his avoidance scheme secret			1
his legal team argued the tribunal should be heard behind closed doors so as not to infringe his ‘ right to respect for his private and family life ’			0
his lawyer also said if his membership were exposed , ‘ his career might be damaged ’			0
as @entity207 host , he earned £ 500,000 a year			0
judge @entity128 rejected this on the grounds there was an obvious public interest in keeping tax cases public			0
@entity87 took significant flak from audiences after revelations of his use of tax avoidance schemes , especially since he had previously made jokes about it on the show ten o'clock @entity221 in 2012 , comedian @entity87 took flak for having taken part in a different tax avoidance scheme called @entity224			1
the scheme , based in @entity21 , involves people resigning from their company and receiving all further payments or salary to an offshore trust			0
the individual then receives a small part of those payments as a ' salary ' and the rest as a ' loan ' which does not accrue tax because technically , it can be recalled			0
this means that by using the @entity240 people can cut their tax bill from £ 127,000 to £ 3,500 if they have earnings of £ 280,000			0
@entity87 took insults from audiences following the revelations of his tax avoidance , and eventually apologised , but not before telling an audience who attended one of his shows : ' i pay what i have to and not a penny more			2

@entity3 used ' working wheels ' tax avoidance scheme to claim back money
involves recording you are running a second - hand car business
@entity3 says he was assured the scheme was legal and he ' made mistake '
the scheme has attracted many other @entity113 who have very high earnings
