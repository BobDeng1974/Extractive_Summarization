by @entity1 reporter whatever will they say on @entity3 ? ballroom dancing fans are in a whirl over a proposal which could prevent same sex dance partners from competing against mixed sex couples			1
the @entity9 ( @entity10 ) is considering a rule change which would define a dance partnership as being ' one man and one lady ... unless otherwise stated '			1
but @entity10 president @entity28 insisted the proposal followed complaints that mixed sex dance partners were ' unfairly disadvantaged ' in competitions against all - male couples			1
mr @entity28 said : ' there had been complaints from a number of people who felt they were unfairly disadvantaged by the participation of all male dance couples who are physically stronger			1
' we 're looking to regulate the situation as there is nothing in the rules at the moment			2
' there is no proposal to stop same sex couples dancing			1
we do n't discriminate on colour , race , sexuality or anything else			0
' my gut feeling is it would probably help to strengthen same sex competitions			0
i wish we had more of them			0
' the proposal , which will be considered at the @entity10 's change of rules meeting on july 21 , reads : ' this council recognises a partnership to be one man and one lady in all adult amateur and professional competitions and championships unless otherwise stated			1
' ballroom dancing organisers are worried that all male couples could have an advantage over mixed sex couples ( pictured , @entity72 and @entity73 compete in last year 's competition ) @entity75 , who competes with her female dance partner @entity76 , said : ' i am really distressed that the @entity10 is even considering banning us			1
' we 've put in a huge amount of effort			0
to exclude us will mean that we ca n't dance in mainstream competitions any more			0
' ms @entity75 , who is @entity83 same - sex senior women 's ballroom champion with her partner ms @entity76 , has written to mr @entity28 to voice her concerns			2
she added : ' contrary to claims by some supporters of the new rule , male same - sex dance duos do not have an advantage			1
' ballroom dancing is not like tennis or football			0
power and strength are not the key to winning			0
' @entity97 , musicality , expression			0
timing , floorcraft and presentation are the main judging criteria			0
this means that two men do not have an advantage over a mixed - sex couple			1
' human rights campaigner @entity107 said : ' we are concerned this proposed ban may be motivated by some judges , competitors and spectators not being comfortable with the participation of same - sex dance partners			2
' it is understood the @entity10 rules committee will meet on july 20 to decide whether or not to put forward the proposals to the governing body 's board of directors			0
if the proposal goes ahead , the board of directors meet on july 21 to decide whether or not to adopt the rule change .			2

@entity9 considering changing *definition* of partnership
new rule defines it as ' one man and one lady ... unless otherwise stated '
*advocates* say it is because male - male couples have unfair advantage
