fans have been standing in queues for days , anxious to get their hands on @entity4 's latest @entity3			1
so what do one group of fans do the moment they get the @entity3 in their hands ? why , tear it down into little pieces , of course ! however , this is standard practice for the @entity13 team , who always deconstruct products to figure out the value and provenance of the components inside			1
the insides of a phone can be quite revealing to tech fans			2
you can see if corners have been shaved , or no expense spared on the components inside			2
you can even divulge information about @entity4 's relationships with suppliers - for instance , arch - rival @entity26 seems more absent than first expected			1
however , the teardown found that while users still need special screwdrivers to open the phone , it was far easier to repair than previous models			2
@entity13 said : ' this iphone may be the most repairable @entity3 we 've seen in a while			1
' at least some of the processors inside the @entity3 have not come from @entity26 , instead coming from relatively - unknown company @entity55			1
perhaps this is because of the frosty relationships between the two companies - coming on the back of a billion - dollar lawsuit successfully won by @entity4			2
or instead it may just be @entity4 sharing the demand for the phone by using a range of suppliers			2
from the images , it also seems that @entity69 's mantra that a device should be as beautiful within as it is on the surface still holds true			1
the @entity13 team have awarded the @entity3 a ' 7 out of 10 ' for repairability , as - despite @entity4 's insistence on phones being repaired in - shop - all the components are easily accessible and easy to re-assemble			1
@entity13 's @entity3 was purchased in @entity78 - the first country to sell @entity79 - within the first hour of trading			1
inside the @entity3 : @entity13 opened their phone as soon as they purchased it , to let the tech world know about the internals of @entity4 's new device getting an @entity3 is no easy task , as @entity4 prefers to keep their electronics sealed			1
@entity91 experts need to buy special @entity4 screwdrivers to open the unit			0
once inside , users then need a special suction device to remove the screen			0
the team then rushed home to tear the phone apart , with their own pair of @entity4 's propriety screw - drivers at hand as @entity4 does not like users opening phones themselves			1
after unscrewing the back - cover , the team use a suction cap to lift the screen from the rear housing			1
this is a step - up from previous models , which required more work to remove the screen			2
the team say the move means the @entity3 is likely to be far easier to repair than previous handsets			1
@entity13 said : ' compare this to the @entity115 , where it took 38 steps to isolate the display assembly , and this @entity3 may be the most repairable @entity3 we 've seen in a while			1
' removing the screen unveils the newly designed battery which is of a longer design and , at @entity124 , contains a fraction more than the @entity126 found on the @entity115			0
as other components - from audio chips to power modules to radio antennas - we can see that the @entity3 contains many chips from the same companies which supply the vast majority of smartphone makers			1
@entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 all have components tucked inside , suggesting they will do well from @entity4 's latest release			1
@entity4 is believed to have used three different manufacturers to make screens , so suppliers could vary from handset to handset			2
it is believed the firm made the move to ensure delays from one supplier could not impact @entity3 delivery dates			1
however , it was reported in recent week that one supplier , @entity154 , had fallen behind of shipments			0
however , @entity4 appeared to be able to meet demand			0
the interior also reveal one of @entity4 's trademarks - a neat , tidy design			1
when the firm was set up , co-founder @entity161 was renowned for his ability to create clean designs using far fewer components than the competition			2
the firm even used to sign the interior of the first machines to make engineers feel part of the product			2
now , sadly that has ended - but the tradition of clean , simple design has survived - even though most of this will always remain hidden to most fans			0
what a sucker : once the screws are removed from the @entity3 , the @entity13 team can lift the screen off @entity13 was founded in 2003 by @entity182 and @entity183 , after a night frustrating night pulling an old @entity185 laptop apart			1
they realised that few tech products came with an instruction manual on how to dis - assemble a device and re-assemble it			0
companies do not like consumers ' tearing down ' products which , as a starting point , will invalidate a warranty and - worst case - could lead to injury due to faulty electrical parts			2
but tinkerers and tweakers always like to get hands - on with their kit , so @entity182 and @entity183 began ' tearing down ' new products , in a bid to build guides for those who want a ' how - to '			0
speaking of their @entity185 experience : ' we tinkered			0
we broke some tabs and lost a few screws			0
but we fixed it ! tweaking out the errors : the @entity13 team , seen here pulling out the camera components of the @entity3 , help regular users make hardware fixes for themselves household repairs : the website has expanded to deal with a range of household items ' we attempted to fix some other laptops but had trouble finding parts			1
so we bought a broken computer on @entity225 and stole parts from it			0
then we decided to start selling the parts ourselves , and @entity13 was born			0
' for the first time , it was easy for someone with no technical background or experience to take apart a @entity234 step - by - step instructions were enabling people to repair @entity237 they would n't have been able to repair on their own			0
' ' we thought the instructions would be useful to our customers - and they were			0
but it turned out that they were useful to a lot of other people as well			0
' from @entity246 to @entity247 , @entity248 to the @entity249 , people have used our guides to fix their stuff			0
they saved money , they kept their @entity237 out of landfills , and they did it completely by themselves			0
' now , everytime a popular device comes out - in particular , the @entity255 and @entity183 are on the spot , frequently within the first hour or two , and ready to tear a device to pieces to be the first to see inside the coveted and jealously - guarded machines			0
so next time you hear something rattling in your phone , or the screen starts going wrong , then if you are confident with a screwdriver , consider visiting @entity13 - but be warned : if you pour coffee all over your @entity3 , you will need a miracle to bring it back to life			1
standard components : the display connector is held firmly to the logic board by a few simple @entity272 screw @entity273 and standard : @entity4 has their own ' @entity274 ' on - board , while @entity136 , who supply @entity278 among others , supply the phone antenna chip ' this contact connects the metal frame around the front - facing camera to the frame around the rear - facing camera			1
maybe this frame is some kind of an antenna ? only time will tell			0
there are all kinds of metal - to - metal contacts inside the @entity3			1
spring contacts make for easy repairs , but mandate careful attention to cleaning all the parts before reassembly			2
inside the @entity3 : ' spring contacts make for easy repairs , but mandate careful attention to cleaning all the parts before reassembly ' finger oils can get in the way of these metal contacts and cause frustrating component failures			1
speaking of antennas , a ' spudger ' easily pries one end of an antenna connector off of the logic board near the battery			0
in the @entity115 , this antenna location was reserved for the cellular antenna			0
we wo n't know for sure what this antenna 's purpose is until we uncover more			0
' @entity13 has published teardown guide for all of @entity4 's main competitors , from the latest blackberry to @entity26 's @entity318			1
the images below reveal the different approaches other manufacturers use			0
the @entity318 , the @entity3 's arch rival			1
it uses a plastic casing which users can take off themselves tho change the battery			0
@entity328 's @entity327 , showing the larger number of components and bigger motherboard			2
@entity13 has also taken apart previous @entity332 , including the @entity115 , seen here laid bare			0
the design is similar to the @entity3			2
see video review from ifixit here :			0

ifixit team disassembles new @entity3 in order to figure out who makes the components
@entity342 , @entity137 and @entity136 provide parts of the phone - but @entity26 seems *conspicuously* absent
@entity69 's mantra to make it as ' beautiful ' within as on the surface is alive and well
