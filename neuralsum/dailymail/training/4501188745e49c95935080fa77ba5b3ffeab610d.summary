by @entity0 published : 18:02 est , 30 september 2012 updated : 02:30 est , 1 october 2012 mps last night called for an urgent investigation into the @entity4 spy chief who stands to gain from @entity6 ’s biggest ever defence deal			2
sir @entity7 , who played a key role in the dodgy dossier on @entity11 ’s weapons , is lobbying the government in support of the £ 28billion merger			1
he now works for @entity15 , which is advising @entity16 on its proposed merger with @entity19 rival @entity18			1
sir @entity7 , pictured , now works for @entity15 , which is advising @entity16 on its proposed merger with @entity19 rival @entity18 the investment bank is in line to make millions if the deal goes ahead and mps want to know how much sir @entity7 , who left @entity25 in october 2009 , will gain personally from lobbying his former colleagues			1
insiders say the 64 year old is ‘ liaising ’ between the bank and the government to help ‘ soothe concerns ’ in no 10 about the deal			2
critics of the tie - up say handing control of @entity16 to a company in part controlled by the @entity38 and @entity39 governments will undermine national security , lead to the closure of key defence facilities in the @entity6 and destroy @entity6 ’s military and intelligence relationship with the @entity45			1
details of sir @entity7 ’s involvement have reinforced the notion that the deal – which has @entity50 and @entity52 ’s support – is being stitched together by the @entity54 establishment			1
@entity23 have already demanded the chance to question cabinet secretary sir @entity56 , who has been pushing the deal with the prime minister and has had a series of meetings with @entity16 and the bank			1
he worked for four years at @entity15 and mps are concerned he has a conflict of interest by promoting the deal in @entity66			1
the @entity67 confirmed yesterday that sir @entity7 was banned from lobbying government for a period of a year following his last day of his service			1
but now that has expired he is clear to call his old contacts			2
he and sir @entity56 face being dragged before the commons defence select committee , which is investigating the @entity16 deal			1
sir @entity76 , the senior @entity77 on the committee , said sir @entity7 should be called to give evidence and forced to answer questions about how much he will personally profit from the deal			1
‘ i have serious concerns about the merger , both from a defence point of view and for job reasons , ’ he said			1
‘ i am of the view that there ’s too cosy an arrangement between former ministers and civil servants becoming consultants when they leave government			2
‘ i ’d prefer it if the time limit on them going into lobbying was ten years , not one			2
the public perception is that people like this are using the contacts they gained as ministers and civil servants			0
‘ if sir @entity7 is trying to use the influence he has to skew a decision he ought to come before us so someone can ask who much he is being paid and whether he stands to get a personal bonus if the deal goes through			1
’ @entity112 , the @entity113 mp who is coordinating @entity115 opposition to the deal , said sir @entity7 was a poor choice for @entity16			1
‘ the last thing the defence industry needs is the overseer of the dodgy dossier to be lobbying on your behalf , ’ he said			0
he said sir @entity7 had no track record in the aerospace industry and ‘ was n’t a particularly stunning success as a civil servant ’			1
a senior civil servant also expressed doubts , saying : ‘ there are lots of people prepared to offer former ministers and mandarins large sums of money because they think they know how to open doors			0
i ’m not sure they always represent very good value for money			0
every day that passes after they leave , they are a day less plugged in to the people and the way things are done			0
’ a @entity67 spokesman said sir @entity7 had complied fully with the @entity147			1
his appointment with @entity15 in march 2010 was approved on the advice of the independent advisory committee			1
’ by @entity151 sir @entity56 , who holds extraordinary influence inside @entity153 , finds himself dragged into controversy over his former business interests for the second time in barely a year			1
the cause of his trouble last year was the disaster which stuck the @entity160 care homes group			0
and , as with the latest row over defence giant @entity16 , it concerned his time spent as a senior manager at the investment bank @entity15			1
@entity160 , which looked after 31,000 frail elderly people at the height of its success , was bought by the @entity45 private equity firm @entity169 in 2004			0
influence : sir @entity56 finds himself dragged into controversy over his former business interests for the second time in barely a year @entity169 floated it on the stock market two years later and sold all its shares in 2007 – taking a huge profit			2
but the flotation , which had been based upon the sale and lease - back of the company ’s homes , left @entity160 in a hugely precarious state by saddling it with expensive long - term rent commitments			0
when the economy downturn came , it could no longer afford to pay many of its bills – leaving the elderly and their relatives fearing they would be evicted			0
sir @entity56 was safely inside @entity66 as ministers wrestled with trying to find a solution to this mess in the summer of 2011			2
but , in a huge personal embarrassment to the mandarin , a report by the @entity192 union revealed the controversial stock market flotation had been guided by @entity15 , at a time when he was co-head of @entity6 investment banking between 2004 and 2007 , during a break from the civil service			1
the bank advised @entity169 on the float , informing it of stock exchange rules , helping draw up a prospectus , setting the share sale price and attracting investors			0
@entity15 is believed to have shared in a £ 10million fee with other advisers , including @entity209 bank @entity208			1
although mr @entity56 did not work directly on the @entity160 deal , he was the ultimate boss of the team that managed it			0
it was never made clear how much , if any , of a personal bonus sir @entity56 was paid for overseeing the @entity160 float in 2006			2
however banking sources said he would have been handsomely rewarded			0
@entity218 , a national officer at the @entity192 , said the civil servant was in the @entity160 scandal ‘ up to his neck ’			0
@entity223 of over- 50s group @entity222 said : ‘ i am absolutely staggered someone involved in this can be so influential in no 10			0
’ sir @entity56 was brought back to government by @entity226 in 2007			2
he became involved in rumours that he was the source for journalist @entity230 ’s claims that mr @entity226 bullied his staff			0
it was he who apparently emailed no 10 workers to inform them of their rights if they were treated badly			0
since mr @entity226 ’s departure from @entity153 , the father - of - three ’s career has flourished			0
he is said to have a very close working relationship with @entity50 – with some @entity113 mps being concerned that he has far too much sway			0
in particular , he has been embroiled in a series of rows over @entity245 ’s plan to ‘ make work pay ’ by shaking up the benefits system			0
sir @entity56 is reported to have said he was ‘ sceptical ’ about the plan for a universal benefit – language which was seen as an attempt by the civil service to derail the flagship policy			2
he is also understood to be part of a cabal of @entity66 and @entity257 advisers which has been pressing mr @entity50 to water down his commitment to reduce net migration to tens of thousands a year .			0

sir @entity7 works for @entity15 , which is advising @entity16 on its proposed merger with @entity19 rivals @entity18
