the mother - of - two , who was yesterday spared a jail sentence , walked off with £ 7,363 - worth of shoes before staff noticed a large amount of the shop ’s stock was advertised on @entity21			1

’ @entity1 , originally from @entity63 , @entity64 , stole shoes from the brand ’s @entity66 ranges – with some pairs worth up to £ 400 each			1
mr @entity46 said : ‘ she admitted what she had done was take the shoes out of the boxes from the stock room over a period of weeks , worn them home and then placed them on @entity21 to sell			2
there was an element of pre-planning and deviousness because the defendant left empty boxes in the right place in the stock room			0

serial thief : after stealing the designer footwear from @entity100 , above , the mother would then sell them on @entity21 ‘ because the defendant had not volunteered the extent of her criminality and the second tranche significantly increased the loss to the company it was reported to the police and on november 24 last year the defendant attended @entity31 police station			2
