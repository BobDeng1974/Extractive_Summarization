if ever anyone had a justified case for having road rage it has to be this truck driver in @entity5 who avoided what could have been a fatal accident , not once , but twice , when a reckless driver careered into his path			1
as if to prove the theory that you ca n't make something idiot - proof , because someone will eventually come along and invent a new idiot , having escaped death once the dim - witted driver then speeds down the left - hand side of the truck and back into the way again			2
the truck driver was forced into taking evasive action for a second time seconds after avoiding the initial head on collision			0
a man known only as @entity38 was behind the wheel of the tanker , which was doing 100km/h			0
he just about kept the tanker upright at first , swerving quickly to the right , across the opposite lane and onto the shoulder , before veering back to the left again			0
but just when @entity38 thinks the coast is clear , the @entity26 cuts down past the left - hand side of the truck , apparently totally oblivious to the carnage he already almost caused			1
the video was uploaded to @entity53 group @entity52			0
it was marked 2012 , however the driver of the truck told the group that his date stamp was incorrect , and that it actually happened earlier this month			2
the truck driver can only look on in horror as the car goes into the @entity62 it was taken about 30km out of @entity64 on the @entity65 , near @entity66 , on thursday november 6 , according to the group			1
police were not aware of the incident			0
there 's nothing for it but to take evasive action and swerve around the car to avoid a certain crash to make matters worse , seconds later the @entity26 cuts back down past the left - hand side of the truck			1
