@entity1 playmaker @entity0 believes the champions are now in position to turn up the heat on @entity5			1
city have hit form in the past month with a run of eight consecutive victories - one short of a club record - in all competitions			2
that sequence has carried them into the last 16 of the @entity14 and wiped out the eight - point advantage @entity5 held over them at the top of the @entity18 just last month			1
@entity0 appears to point towards the bench after scoring his second goal against @entity21 the @entity22 do still have a game in hand - at @entity24 on monday night - but after an indifferent spell in october and november , @entity1 now have momentum			1
@entity0 said : ' big teams have to get used to this type of pressure , and we need to replicate it until the end of the season and win as many trophies as we can			1
' we were eight points behind @entity5 a few weeks ago and now we have the same number of points - at least until they play on monday - so maybe we can put a bit of pressure on them			1
' but we will focus on ourselves and hope they drop some points			0
' @entity0 was at the heart of @entity1 's latest victory , scoring twice in saturday 's 3 - 0 defeat of troubled @entity21 at the @entity46			1
the 28 - year - old ( right ) meets @entity49 's cross to double @entity1 's lead just after the hour mark with strikers @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 all injured , the @entity52 played in a central role just behind makeshift centre - forward @entity58			1
the 28 - year - old , for all his attacking prowess and technical brilliance , is not a renowned goalscorer but he seemed to revel in the responsibility			0
@entity0 put @entity1 ahead with a deflected strike early in the second half and doubled the lead on the hour before @entity67 wrapped up the points late on			1
' i like to play in the middle , even though i can play on both wings , ' said @entity0 , who was making only his second start after an eight - game lay - off with a knee injury			1
' when i play in the middle i get chances to score , and that is why i scored the two goals			0
' but i will be happy to help the team when the strikers are back			0
@entity81 has scored 12 goals in 18 appearances for @entity5 since joining in the summer ' i am very happy for the two goals but i am really delighted because i have just come back			1
what i love most is to play , so i just want to continue playing			0
' @entity1 will hope to keep up the pressure by carrying their form through the @entity88 programme			2
they travel to @entity89 on @entity90 before hosting @entity91 two days later			0
@entity92 are their visitors on @entity93 with @entity94 the opponents in the @entity97 third round on january 4			0
it is a congested programme but one @entity0 , signed from @entity99 in 2010 , is now well used to			2
he said : ' it 's the way the competition is , and in years past i have played on @entity90 and december 28 , and have n't lost a game			2
@entity54 is just one of a host of strikers missing for @entity1 currently through injury ' it is difficult to do that and then raise your game again for @entity93 , but playing here you just have to accept that			2
we are looking forward to it			0
' i will celebrate with my family on @entity115			0
they always come here and it is nice because i do n't see them in the whole year			0
' the best celebration would be to win at @entity89			0
@entity88 is better when you win so we are hoping for three points			2

@entity1 are level on points with leaders @entity5 having played a game more than @entity129 's side
@entity0 scored twice for the champions in 3 - 0 win against @entity21 on saturday
the @entity52 hopes his side can now put the pressure on the leaders
city were eight points behind @entity129 's men just a few weeks ago
