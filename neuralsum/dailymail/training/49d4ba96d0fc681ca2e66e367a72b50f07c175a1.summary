the mother of a girl with a fatal disease yesterday begged to be allowed to have @entity4 's first ' three - parent ' baby			1
@entity5 wants to be able to implant @entity6 from a donor egg into one of her own eggs which would be fertilised by her partner 's sperm			1
this would stop her passing on her own faulty genetic material to a second child , who would effectively have three parents			2
@entity4 scientists have spent 15 years researching the @entity19 technique – and mps will vote tomorrow on whether to make it legal			1
@entity5 wants to be allowed to have @entity4 's first ' three - parent ' baby , pictured with her daughter @entity22 supporters – including five @entity25 prize winners – have hailed it as a godsend to parents who need to avoid passing incurable diseases to their children			1
opponents say that creating ' designer babies ' crosses an ethical line and the science is unproven			1
miss @entity5 's daughter @entity22 , who was born in 2013 , has @entity37 syndrome , which is caused by her mother 's faulty mitochondrial dna			1
the crippling illness targets the vital organs and means the one - year - old will never walk or talk and is likely to die within a few years			2
miss @entity5 , a 38 - year - old management consultant from @entity43 , @entity44 , told the @entity45 : ' we adore @entity22			1
to us she 's special and unique but to have another child knowing what they could suffer does n't bear thinking about			2
' if mps vote to allow the treatment it will not only be fantastic for us but help so many others too			1
' when you 're given the worst possible news it helps to have a little bit of hope			0
it would mean so much to us to be able to have a healthy child			0
' around one in 5,000 @entity4 are believed to suffer from mitochondrial disorders , which are passed from mother to child , and researchers believe around 2,500 women of child - bearing age are carriers			1
the @entity69 dr @entity68 said the @entity71 ’ @entity70 did not believe there has been sufficient scientific study or consultation into the ethics , safety and efficacy of the technique many children with the conditions are disabled and die in infanthood and women carrying damaged mitochondria can also miscarry repeatedly			0
international charities and campaigners wrote an open letter to mps to lobby them to change the law , saying it ' offers families the first glimmer of hope that they might be able to have a baby that will live without pain and suffering '			2
it said : ' mitochondrial disease is unimaginably cruel			0
it strips our children of the skills they have learned , inflicts pain that can not be managed , and tires their organs one by one until their little bodies can not go on any more			0
' we know that no novel medical procedure is without risk			0
we have absolute confidence in the expert scientific panel that has extensively scrutinised these techniques			0
' miss @entity5 is being treated by @entity111 , a neurology professor at @entity112 who has pioneered the mitochondrial replacement technique			1
he is expected to be the first to carry out such treatment , which involves replacing faulty mitochondrial dna in a mother 's egg with healthy cells from a donor			0
@entity120 , the government 's chief medical officer , has likened the technique to ' changing a faulty car battery '			2
but critics including @entity125 – former @entity126 minister @entity125 – want a committee to consider if the science is safe before any change to the @entity130			0
a recent safety report by the watchdog , the @entity131 , said the procedure should not be used to create babies until further tests had been carried out			0
miss @entity5 hopes to watch the vote in the @entity138 from the public gallery with daughter and her partner @entity141			1
if the change is approved by mps and peers , it will not become law until october			0
the @entity147 has warned against making a decision without knowing more about how hereditary characteristics are passed on by mitochondria – the tiny ' engine rooms ' that power cells in the body .			0

mps will vote whether to make *controversial* @entity19 technique legal
