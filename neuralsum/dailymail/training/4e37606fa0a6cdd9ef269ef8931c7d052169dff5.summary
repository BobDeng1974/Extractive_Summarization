' irresponsible ' : anti-drugs campaigners last night condemned an exhibition at the @entity3 in @entity4 where speakers will discuss the uses of marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms other lectures include seeing through @entity35 , about the ‘ helpful properties ’ of cannabis , while another event celebrates the hallucinogen psilocybin as the ‘ powerful chemical which makes mushrooms magic ’			1
the three - week exhibition is set to begin on september 20 at the 300 - acre @entity3 , which receives about half its funding from the government			1
it has been given £ 114.5 million of public money since 2010			0
curators insist that the event , which will display ‘ notorious mind - altering plants ’ in the @entity53 , will ‘ in no way condone the use of illegal drugs ’			1
but last night campaign groups said that @entity4 , whose patron is prince @entity62 , was ‘ failing to safeguard youngsters from the dangers of drugs ’			2
@entity63 , chief executive of the charity @entity64 , said : ‘ the literature from @entity3 reads like an invitation for children to come and experiment with drugs			1
i am sure these people are all experts in their field but i deal with families who have lost children to drugs and my son died as a result of them			2
‘ the organisers are behaving extremely irresponsibly and not safeguarding youngsters			0
it ’s awful a publicly funded organisation is using its money for such a festival			0
’ platform : professor @entity17 will give a keynote speech on the ' chemical underworld of mind - altering plants ' prof @entity17 has recently called for users to be given ‘ more informed choices about their use of legal and controlled drugs ’			1
he said his lecture would discuss the ‘ relative harms of drugs ’ and possible new treatments using controlled substances such as psilocybin			1
‘ the regulations controlling psilocybin mushrooms are ten times more strict than those controlling heroin , ’ he said			2
‘ it makes no sense			0
all it does is stop people like me doing research and helping develop treatments			0
i am not recommending the use of any drug			0
the law is designed to keep recreational users from harm			0
if it does n’t do that , but massively impairs research , it is actually doing people a disservice			0
’ but @entity116 , of campaign group @entity117 , said : ‘ @entity4 should not be giving him this platform			0
drugs are too serious a subject to be treated in this manner			2
but they ’ve done it because they know he ’s controversial			0
’ @entity124 , of the @entity125 and a former @entity127 assistant chief investigation officer , said : ‘ professor @entity17 will go anywhere and do anything to bang his drum for the normalisation of drug use			0
‘ he writes about giving drug users accurate information but those most badly affected by drugs are often young people who have n’t developed a risk - judgment mechanism			2
’ a @entity3 spokeswoman said no illegal drugs would be exhibited at the festival , only ‘ the living plants from which illegal and legal drugs are derived ’			1
these could be viewed only from behind a security barrier			0
‘ we are aiming to show how plants ’ identities have been manipulated through time , sometimes portrayed as friend , sometimes as foe , when no plant is inherently a drug , a medicine , or a poison , ’ she added			2
