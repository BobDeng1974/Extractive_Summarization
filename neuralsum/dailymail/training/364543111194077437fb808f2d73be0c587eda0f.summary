by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity4 's front - row resources could be stretched alarmingly during the autumn tests after it emerged that two injured @entity7 props are destined to miss the four - match campaign			1
@entity10 ’s @entity9 and @entity11 of @entity12 are both in rehabilitation after serious setbacks and neither is expected to return to action until november			1
on that basis , they will not be in contention to play for the national team against @entity21 visitors @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
@entity4 head coach @entity26 is due to name his elite player squad in october			1
he and his assistants must prepare to be without @entity9 — the country ’s premier tighthead , who has had neck surgery — until the @entity33			2
missing : @entity9 will play no part in @entity4 's schedule this autumn and is expected to return in november blow : @entity11 of @entity12 ( centre ) is also out after dislocating his knee in the @entity40 final headache : it is n't ideal preparation for @entity4 coach @entity26 ahead of the autumn tests at the launch of the @entity47 season , the @entity10 ’ director of rugby @entity48 said : ‘ @entity50 has had the all - clear from the surgeon to ramp up his training and that was a week ago			1
he should be fit about 12 weeks from that date , so we ’re hoping @entity9 will be playing again in 10 or 11 weeks , but we will see			2
we will give him as much time as he needs			0
the disc that has been replaced will be stronger than the one he had in there in the first place			0
‘ we will listen to the specialists to make sure that when he comes back , he is good to go			0
it would be nice to have him back within the 12 - week timescale but if it ’s a month later , two months later or he does n’t play until april , it is what it is			0
‘ it ’s far more important that he gets his neck absolutely right rather than come back a bit early and have issues with it			0
@entity26 is very sensible about it			1
@entity50 will be ready to play when the specialist deems he is ready and not before			0
‘ the disc has been replaced			0
it is a metal disc — there ’s a plate and a ball - and - socket joint inside			0
he has been letting the bone heal and has done nothing at all for a few months , but now he can start doing some cycling , some running , some light weights and gradually build himself back up			2
’ @entity9 , 27 , has played 45 times since he made his debut at the 2010 @entity33 , as well as representing the @entity7 in 2013 as a substitute in all three @entity88 against @entity25			1
@entity90 ’s @entity89 has stepped into the tighthead role , backed up by @entity92 of @entity93			0
@entity11 had an operation after dislocating his knee during last season ’s @entity96 — an injury which ruled him out of @entity4 ’s tour of @entity22			1
the 23 - year - old loosehead is on the mend but @entity12 wo n’t expect him to regain full fitness for some time			1
the club ’s director of rugby , @entity103 , said : ‘ @entity11 has an injury from the @entity107 final			0
he ’ll be out for a while — until november possibly			0
but he has no chance for the autumn internationals			2
’ meanwhile , @entity12 also expect to be without @entity4 fly - half @entity111 for the start of the @entity47 season as he continues his comeback from a knee injury which ended his own tour involvement			1
‘ @entity111 is coming back , ’ added @entity103			2
‘ he may miss the first couple of games of the season but we ’ve got @entity122 there so we have cover			2
