by @entity0 i 'm a huge fan of make - up and skincare from @entity5 pharmacy brands			1
they combine technological expertise with a chic , elegant look			2
we all know how @entity5 girls have that je ne sais quoi – an indefinable cool and gorgeousness that seems to come naturally			1
well i think i know the secret to je ne sais quoi : it 's these continental cosmetics ! @entity0 has stayed loyal to her favourite @entity5 cosmetic brands despite having a plethora of @entity20 make - up available on her doorstep i 've spoken quite a few times about my favourite @entity5 skincare products , so this week i 'm sharing with you some other products i 've been loving of late			1
i 've been reaching for them non-stop since i 've arrived in the @entity28 , so thought it was time to let you guys in on the secret , too ! @entity34 's @entity5 favourites @entity35 30 , £ 13 @entity0 says that the @entity37 cream makes a great make - up base and calls the @entity39 the scent of the season @entity37 creams are a recent beauty invention			1
@entity37 stands for @entity44 , and these fabulous formulas work to combat skincare issues while also acting as a lightweight make - up base			2
@entity37 is formulated for sensitive skin that is prone to redness			0
the silky formula is enriched with @entity51 and naturally derived @entity52 , which helps to neutralise long - term redness			0
refreshing and non-oily , the cream glides over the skin without leaving any streaks for a truly natural - looking finish			1
@entity59 , £ 29.33 beauty lovers have gone wild for this heavenly fragrance , and i have joined their ranks in declaring it the scent of the season			1
relaxed and exotic , @entity39 is based upon @entity39 's famous @entity67 , the bestselling multipurpose oil that moisturises and subtly perfumes the skin			1
reminiscent of golden beaches and warm island breezes , this fragrance is quite simply summer in scent			2
@entity75 , £ 6 a cover - up that cares for problem skin , this concealer stick will reduce the appearance of imperfections both immediately and over time			0
its oil - free formula is proven to reduce blemishes while calming irritation in even the most sensitive skins			0
the nude tinted stick counteracts redness and conceals spots and blemishes with its high coverage , non-irritating texture			0
i always keep one handy in my handbag in case of sudden breakouts or flushes			0
@entity97 , £ 7.19 there 's nothing like a zesty shower gel to wake you up and get you buzzing in the morning			2
this energising scent blends notes of flowers , leaves and lemon fruits to leave you refreshed and ready to take on the world ! not only that , but thanks to its aloe vera enriched formula , this shower gel maintains the skin 's delicate ph balance , unlike some harsher cleansers			2
which means soft , healthy skin that looks and smells gorgeous ! @entity0 always keeps the @entity75 in her handbag and loves the @entity120 for a zesty wake - up call @entity0 uses the @entity123 hair mask for when her tresses needs a little extra @entity126 and loves @entity129 sun protection 's non-sticky texture @entity130 , £ 18 i 'm pretty obsessive about caring for my hair – after all , your crowning glory will only look glorious if you keep it nourished , protected and healthy			1
when hair is dry and damaged , it needs some intensive @entity126 , and this powerful treatment mask works wonders			1
its formula boasts the unparalleled moisturising capabilities of shea butter together with conditioning quince pectins , which work to repair and regenerate hair			2
your locks are left looking and feeling silky , luminous , strong and bouncy			0
@entity146 , £ 10.99 i do n't need to tell you guys about the importance of protecting your skin with a good sunscreen			0
the great thing about this @entity129 product is its dry oil formulation			0
dry oils are intensely moisturising without leaving a greasy , sticky residue			0
this one has a silky texture that sinks into the skin rapidly and keeps skin supple and soft whilst helping to protect it from the sun 's harsh rays			2
it also includes powerful antioxidants , which help your skin to stay beautiful for longer			0
the oil is paraben - free , water resistant , hypoallergenic , and 100 per cent suitable for sensitive skin			0
i 'll be packing this for my holidays , but even on city summer days i give my legs and arms a spritz before heading out			0

i 've also been using the @entity208 to add a gorgeous pink flush to my cheeks – the formulation has a slight shimmer to it so is perfect for adding a subtle highlight to the tops of cheekbones			1
