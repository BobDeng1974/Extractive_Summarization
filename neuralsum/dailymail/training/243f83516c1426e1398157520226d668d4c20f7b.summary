by @entity0 published : 12:15 est , 30 november 2012 updated : 17:46 est , 30 november 2012 plea : @entity1 warns the @entity2 will have been ' almost useless ' unless it is agreed in its totality @entity1 has said the £ 4million taxpayer - funded @entity2 will have been ' almost useless ' unless @entity4 cements its recommendations in law			1
the father of missing child @entity8 said the trauma he and other victims re-lived during 16 months of hearings should not be wasted			1
the prime minister must change his mind on statutory regulation of the @entity15 , he added			2
mr @entity1 and his wife @entity17 , as well as the parents of murdered schoolgirl @entity19 and @entity20 - were treated as ' commodities ' and left with no rights to privacy , dignity or basic respect , @entity16 said yesterday			1
but having read his report the families do not believe the judge ' has gone far enough ' to protect them from rogue journalists			2
' i think the only reason we went to @entity16 was to affect change and if @entity16 's report is n't implemented in full then i would say that giving evidence for all of the victims has been almost useless , ' mr @entity1 said			1
' for almost all the victims , the reason they were there was to stop other , ordinary people who were caught up in the most unfortunate circumstances suffering unnecessarily beyond what 's happened to them			2
' and i feel if @entity16 is implemented we will be some way on that route			1
' the jury will still be out of course , to it working in practice , but we will certainly be a few steps further forward			0
' @entity51 ’s review of her disappearance has so far cost £ 2million in its first year after 30 murder squad detectives were called in may 2011			2
they have been sent to @entity56 and @entity57 to gather evidence , including a file of leads from private investigators			0
the cost includes the salaries of the detectives , translation and interpretation fees , travel expenses and office staff			0
appearance : the @entity1 's spoke to the @entity2 almost exactly a year ago but said that their evidence will be wasted without change rejection : @entity4 , pictured today at a school in his constituency , does not want to rubber - stamp @entity16 's report in full giving evidence to the inquiry last year , @entity76 said she felt like ' climbing into a hole and not coming out ' after the @entity80 printed her intensely personal diary , started after her daughter disappeared			1
' our politicians have now got the ability to do the right thing , and the right thing is to implement in full , ' mr @entity1 said			1
' and i think the @entity89 have an opportunity to redeem themselves a little bit with the public by accepting this , putting party political issues aside , and doing the right thing for everyone involved			0
' mr @entity1 said he would have liked to see the @entity16 report go even further - making the new system compulsory , providing a time - scale , holding individual journalists and photographers accountable , and making the regulator fully independent			1
' i do n't think it ( @entity16 's report ) goes far enough , ' he said			1
' the prime minister and our other elected politicians have an opportunity now to do the right thing			0
and if they do the right thing , for the public , then it will help restore a little confidence , ' he said			0
' i clearly respect his opinion but i personally disagree with the viewpoint and @entity114 , as a senior law judge of our country , has made clear that what he is proposing is not a state - run press			2
it is a fine distinction but without the statutory underpinning this system will not work			0
' speaking about the stories printed after his daughter went missing in @entity56 in 2007 , he said : ' the worst thing when @entity8 was abducted was the fact that it was portrayed she was dead and we were responsible for covering it up			1
i do n't think that anybody can go through anything worse			0
' there were many ludicrous aspects , that we had managed top hide a body for 28 days before we had a hire car			0
' newspapers knew what they were writing was not correct but the pound signs made them print it			0
' i would say that having your child abducted is enough to destroy most families but we managed to get through but there were times where we though we might not survive			0
