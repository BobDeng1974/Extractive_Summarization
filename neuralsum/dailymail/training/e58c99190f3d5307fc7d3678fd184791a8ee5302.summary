i have played now already five or six systems and i am looking still for the balance			2
‘ but this system is more attractive and i can play with more attacking players			0
that ’s the reason i am doing that			0
‘ in spite of the fact that we are looking for the balance , our results and our defensive organisation are not bad , and we also score a lot of goals			0
so , i can not say that i am very disappointed about that			0

‘ @entity13 is one of the fans and fans can criticise us , that ’s not a problem			2
that ’s all i have to say on that			0
‘ i am used to it and i think all the players are used to it because they are not first time professional football players			0
