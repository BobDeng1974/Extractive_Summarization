men may rejoice at this season ’s hottest footwear trend , but women are holding up their hands in despair			1
over-the - knee boots have returned to the @entity7 after a stomping comeback on catwalks			1
sexy or slutty ? and can any woman over 40 carry them off ? four @entity14 writers put them to the test … i look like i should be out fishing @entity18 , 42 who ’d have thought that a £ 60 pair of thigh - hugging suede boots from @entity22 could be so hard to get on ? that was my first challenge			1
the second was not collapsing with helpless laughter			2
the fact i ’m wearing a mini-dress with no tights means the whole ensemble screams ‘ schoolgirl in knee socks ’			1
not a look i ’m particularly comfortable cultivating			2
then there are the four - inch heels			1
are these boots really made for walking ? @entity18 felt more like @entity38 in @entity39 in her boots they are also so tight around the ankle that i fear all circulation will be cut off , and my toes will have to be amputated			1
however , one has to suffer to be stylish , and i am dying to hear what my boyfriend @entity46 makes of my outfit			2
sadly , timing is everything and he enters the bedroom just as i ’m struggling , red - faced and panting , to get the boots on			1
this kills the moment rather , but once i ’ve paraded up and down a bit , he concedes they are ‘ very nice ’			2
if i ‘ plan to take up fly fishing ’			2
‘ but do n’t you think i look like @entity38 in @entity39 ? ’ i wail			2
‘ more like @entity64 in mrs @entity65 , ’ is his response			2
but then @entity46 is always like this when i try something new			2
i decide i may have more luck with my friend @entity69 , a gay lawyer who i arrange to meet the next day			0
‘ well , this is an occasion , ’ he declares			0
‘ it ’s not every day @entity18 gets her legs out			1
’ we cross the @entity74 in @entity75 and there ’s a police car stopped at the lights			1
i ’m fairly convinced the handsome young officer at the wheel is eyeing me up			0
then again , on the basis i have n’t quite mastered the art of walking in the boots , he may just be concerned that i ’m drunk and about to stumble on his bonnet			1
on the whole , i ’ve really enjoyed transforming my image			0
i ’d have loved to try on the boots with jeans — but they were too tight to cram denim into			1
they add a definite sexy edge to most outfits , though , and make me feel feminine			1
i just have to learn how to walk in them			0
my daughter cringed , which made me love them more @entity100 , 57 my daughter cringed with embarrassment which only made me love them more it took five minutes to zip myself into my pair of £ 250 duo @entity107 suede boots which for someone who is always in a rush , i would find particularly frustrating			1
the left boot slumped and rumpled like @entity112 ’s stockings and i had to wrestle it up my leg in a pose not dissimilar to one i use at the gym for leg - stretching			1
only now am i told these come made - to measure , meaning there are a number of different calf sizes available			1
i did n’t know boot shopping had got so high - tech ! no wonder i got it wrong			1
now that i ’ve been fitted into my calf size they fit like a dream ! @entity100 modelled her boots at home for a reaction from her partner @entity132 the right one , miraculously , slid on like a glove			1
have i got mismatched legs or were the boots odd sizes ? in either event , i was pleasantly surprised			1
i teamed them with skinny jeans			0
i loved the soft grey suede and , gratifyingly , they seemed to lengthen my leg			0
also , because they ’re just over-the - knee as opposed to sky - thigh - high i did n’t look as if i was auditioning for principal boy at the village panto either			1
feeling quite smug , i clip - clopped downstairs where @entity132 , my partner , was immersed in the sports pages			1
habitually i do n’t arrive in the kitchen at 8am on saturday dressed as if for an outing to @entity153			0
but this fact did n’t impinge on him			0
‘ ahem , ’ i prompted			0
@entity132 finally focused on the boots			1
‘ they ’re quite a statement , ’ he said cagily			0
‘ yes , but in a good or bad way ? ’ i persisted			0
‘ actually , they ’re really quite nice , ’ he added – this , i assure you , is high praise – before returning to his newspaper			0
i wore the boots out to sunday lunch at a country pub – by then i ’d become quite adept at putting them on – and i could n’t help noticing i elicited a fair few glances			1
whether approving or pitying , i could n’t say			0
and you can hardly accost random strangers to ask			0
but @entity172 , 57 , and @entity173 , 59 , the friends we met for lunch , liked them			0
for some reason , @entity173 was overly preoccupied with how long they took to take off			0
friends , of course , are usually kind			0
my daughter @entity182 , 23 , was forthright			0
‘ if you had model ’s legs you ’d get away with them , ’ she said			1
‘ and you ’d look better if they ended at the knee			1
’ i usually listen to @entity182 ’s fashion advice			1
this time , however , i ’m tempted – quite brazenly – to ignore it			0
i ’m too old to dress like a glam - rocker @entity192 , 50 there may be some 50 - year - old women who can totter about in snakeskin thigh boots with four - inch heels and feel coolly assured of their place at the cutting - edge of style			1
i ’m not one of them			0
maybe it was the reaction of the guy i ’m dating that did it			0
having been unabashedly thrilled at the prospect of seeing me in my £ 525 @entity209 boots , his anticipation congealed into frank puzzlement			2
‘ i assume you ’re about to audition for a tribute band to @entity213 ? ’ he queried			0
@entity192 's friend 's daughter was not amused to see her wearing the same boots as @entity217 @entity219 glam - rock was not the effect i ’d been aiming for			1
i was hoping more for the sexy transformation mastered by @entity222 in @entity223 , when she sashays around in @entity225 thigh boots			1
also , my legs — which usually i list among the least hated parts of my body — do n’t look all that great			0
my thighs appear chunky , with saggy knee - blubber settling in folds around the top of the boots			1
still , i ’m sure i can rely on my friend @entity235 for encouragement			0
i stagger off to her house , attempting an air of sassy confidence and ignoring the stares of passers - by			2
@entity235 opens the door — and hoots with laughter			0
‘ @entity245 boots ! ’ she cackles			2
‘ i never had you down as @entity247 ! ’ i try another girlfriend , @entity248			0
‘ @entity249 in panto ! or one of those @entity252 films set in medieval times			0
just slap your thigh ! ’ her daughter @entity255 , 21 , appears			0
‘ i love them ! ’ she exclaims			0
at last ! acknowledgement of my rightful status as a fashion maven ! but she is n’t finished			0
‘ @entity217 wore those boots the other day on this morning , and she ’s like 36 — waaay too old for them			1
i go home and roll on the floor for ten minutes , wrestling with my boots to get them off , while envisaging the headline : @entity269			2
i feel like the fourth musketeer @entity271 , 46 certain women well beyond 40 could carry thigh boots off with aplomb			1
@entity275 , for example , or evergreen rock chick @entity277			0
but i ’m a much more conservative dresser , partly because as a financial writer , i work in a male - dominated environment — and i ’ve realised it does n’t take much to set some men off on a train of thought that is , er , rather unbusinesslike			1
however , i need n’t have worried — my £ 149 boots from @entity286 are more pantomime than provocative			2
‘ @entity290 , hurr , where ’s @entity291 and @entity292 ? ’ quips my husband @entity288			2
he ’s right — the problem with these boots is n’t that they are too tarty , but too @entity296			1
another downside is that they draw attention to a slight hint of thunder - thigh , even though i ’m only a size 10			2
yet they are extremely comfortable , and the expensive - looking burgundy suede puts paid to any aura of dockside brothel			2
the real test is whether they ’ll pass muster with my 70 - something mother — the world ’s most merciless mutton - detector			1
surprisingly , she declares : ‘ lovely autumn colour			0
’ i ’ve come to realise that not all thigh boots are created equal			2
there are the @entity39 ones and the @entity319 ones			0
my pair might not induce @entity321 to rescue me but they are surprisingly chic — and they do n’t half keep your legs warm .			0

over-the - knee boots have returned to the @entity7
men may rejoice at this season ’s hottest footwear trend
but women are holding up their hands in despair
