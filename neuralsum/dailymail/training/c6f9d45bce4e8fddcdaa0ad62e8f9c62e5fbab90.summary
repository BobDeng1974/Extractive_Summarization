by @entity1 reporter published : 23:43 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 11:31 est , 30 august 2012 it like it ’s something out of a science - fiction movie – genius scientists engineer a synthetic skin that ’s part living , part electronics			2
but scientists at @entity8 have done just that , creating meshes of electronic and biological tissue			1
the end result is cyborg tissue , which is created from electrodes and wires combined on a nano - scale			1
engineering humanity : scientists at @entity8 have found a way to create cyborg skin , using nano - wires to mesh and human cells high tech : here , cardiac cells are pictured with a nano - electroic electrode highlighted the results , published in @entity27 , detail how scientists in the lab embedded electrical nanowires into the lab - grown flesh			1
dr @entity33 , who is a chemistry professor at @entity8 and the leader of the research team , told the @entity36 : ‘ with this technology , for the first time , we can work at the same scale as the unit of biological system without interrupting it			2
‘ ultimately , this is about merging tissue with electronics in a way that it becomes difficult to determine where the tissue ends and the electronics begin			0
’ @entity52 notes that the researches initially worried about how the ‘ skin , ’ once implanted , would sense and react to chemical and electrical changes			0
normal human skin is capable of sensing oxygen , @entity58 , and other elements in the air , and reacts to each one accordingly			1
the challenge , then , was engineering skin that would do the same			0
first , a 3d mesh of organic polymer is laid out with nanoscale wires within			0
according to @entity27 , the wires serve as ‘ critical sensing elements			0
’ high tech : a computer chip , containing a sample of nano tissue man vs. machine : cyborg skin has been imagined in @entity74 for decades , including the 1991 blockbuster @entity75 then , they worked in human neurons , heart cells , and blood vessels			1
when the substrate was dissolved , researchers had mesh they could contour into the shapes they needed			0
because of the embedded wiring , scientists were able to obtain accurate readings of @entity58 human cyborgs have been imagined in @entity74 for decades , famously in the @entity89 and @entity90 franchises			1
in both , the cyborg characters have decidedly human appearances , though below the epidermis still lurks a robotic core of metal			0
however , the @entity8 scientists are not looking to such lofty ends			2
dr @entity33 told the @entity36 said their invention could greatly benefit the pharmaceutical industry , which could test its drugs on the cyborg skin instead of few layers of cultured cells .			2

@entity8 scientists created ' cyborg ' skin from neurons , heart cells , and nano - electronic wiring
wiring allows scientists to detect and respond to @entity58 changes on the tissue *'s* *surface* , the same as human skin
