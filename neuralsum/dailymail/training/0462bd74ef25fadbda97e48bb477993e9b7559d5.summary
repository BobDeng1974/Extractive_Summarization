@entity1 education secretary @entity0 said more than half of schools promised rebuilds could still be awaiting work at the end of 2017 @entity9 ’s flagship school building programme is way off track , @entity7 claimed last night			1
despite promising in 2012 that a total of 261 promised rebuilds would ‘ begin immediately ’ , work has started at just 63 of them			1
only 14 school buildings have been handed over for use under mr @entity9 ’s priority school building programme			1
it means that over three quarters of schools promised rebuilds from this government are still waiting for work to start three years and five months after the programme was first launched			1
but last night the @entity26 hit back - denying the scheme was behind schedule , and pointing out that it was managing to build schools a third cheaper than under @entity7			1
a @entity31 source said : ‘ @entity7 must have been at the @entity33 sherry			2
‘ it ’s remarkable to be attacked by them for the state of school building			1
the fact is we ’re building schools quicker and cheaper than under their wasteful programme , saving taxpayers around £ 5million per school			2
‘ if they really want to have a fight on this ground then that ’s fine by us			0
’ however , shadow education secretary , @entity0 , said that if progress on school building continues at the current rate , more than half of those schools promised rebuilds could still be awaiting work to start by the deadline of the end of 2017			1
he said : ‘ this just goes to show that @entity9 ’s @entity60 is decidedly not a priority for this government , limping along at a staggeringly slow pace , ’ he said			0
‘ on top of this , the @entity31 - led government ’s decision to divert scarce resources away from areas desperately in need of more school places in order to fund their flawed @entity72 programme , has meant that more and more pupils up and down the country are being crammed into makeshift temporary classrooms			2
‘ @entity9 desperately needs to get a grip on the crisis he is creating in schools and ensure school buildings and classrooms are fit for our children to learn in			0
’ in july 2011 , the government launched its replacement for @entity7 ’s ‘ @entity89 ’ scheme after they scrapped it – the @entity87			2
in may of the following year , the then education secretary @entity90 announced that work would begin ‘ immediately ’ on 261 schools that would have their condition needs met through the programme			1
it is three years and five months since @entity9 's flagship school building programme was launched , and over two and a half years since @entity90 announced that work would begin ‘ immediately ’ it is now three years and five months since the programme was launched , and over two and a half years since mr @entity90 announced that work would begin ‘ immediately ’			1
but earlier this month , schools minister @entity102 told the @entity103 : ‘ under the @entity60 we have now signed construction contracts for 63 schools			0
‘ eight schools have opened in new buildings since october 2014			0
this brings the total number of schools open in new buildings to 14			0
‘ construction work is continuing at a number of these schools to demolish the old dilapidated buildings			0
’ @entity7 said that if progress was to continue at this rate - 63 schools since the programme ’s launch 41 months ago ; then more than half of those schools promised rebuilds would still be awaiting work to start by the deadline of the end of 2017			1
that is 36 months from now			0
last night the @entity127 pointed out that school buildings are now being constructed for about a third less , saving the taxpayer millions of pounds			0
last night a spokesman for the @entity131 said : ‘ it is nonsense to suggest the @entity60 is behind schedule			0
‘ we are working with all 260 schools in the programme – 14 are open , 59 are being built , 64 contracts have been signed , and the others are in various stages of development			2
‘ under the previous school building initiative , @entity89 , it took three years for building work to begin			1
under the @entity60 this time was slashed to one year			0
and the average secondary school now costs around £ 5million less to build , saving vital taxpayers ’ money			0

the pm ’s flagship school building programme is way off track , @entity7 say
work has started at just 63 of 261 schools promised ' immediate ' rebuilds
shadow education secretary says more than half may not be built by 2017
but the @entity26 *insist* the building scheme is not behind schedule
