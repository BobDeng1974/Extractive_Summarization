by @entity0 published : 05:33 est , 19 july 2012 updated : 07:29 est , 19 july 2012 the @entity1 have not even started yet , but one weary guard for beleaguered security firm @entity3 was sacked after he was found napping on the job			1
the sleepy worker was spotted slumped in a staff entrance of the plush @entity7 in @entity8 - which will host football teams including @entity10 in the latest of a seemingly unending catalogue of embarrassments for @entity3 , the guard was swiftly hauled before bosses and sacked on the spot for the ' unacceptable ' behaviour			1
shambles : police officers guard the @entity7 , @entity19 , in @entity20 , where only 17 of 56 @entity3 guards expected to work showed up for duty his only saving grace , perhaps , was that the man bothered to show up for work at all , as it emerged this week that just 17 out of 56 guards expected to report for duty at the hotel actually appeared			1
similarly , just four of the 58 staff expected to report for duty at the @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 , showed up , one of whom later disappeared			1
a spokesman for @entity3 said : ' the guard was found asleep in the staff entrance			1
' he was told that this was a very serious matter and that security could have been compromised			2
he was dismissed and led away			2
' @entity42 , which includes @entity44 star and @entity7 resident @entity45 and @entity46 defender @entity47 , are one of several teams that will stay at the complex			0
inside the @entity50 : @entity3 has rarely been out of the headlines since it admitted it had failed to employ enough staff to fulfill their £ 284million contract obligations @entity55 , @entity56 and the @entity57 are also set to stop there			1
@entity3 has rarely been out of the headlines since it admitted it had failed to employ enough staff to fulfill their £ 284million contract obligations			1
as a result around 3,500 troops have been commissioned to help secure the @entity1			0
yesterday it was revealed two @entity3 security guards who were due to protect footballers during the @entity1 were arrested on suspicion of being illegal immigrants			1
the men , believed to be from @entity68 , had secured jobs with the under - fire firm to work at the @entity71 , which is due to host 12 matches			2
security : the security cordon outside the @entity75 as spectators are frisked ahead of watching the @entity78 basketball match between the @entity79 and @entity10 officers swooped on the venue after their alleged bogus status is said to have been revealed in an accreditation check by @entity3 , which has been criticised after failing to provide enough staff for the @entity1			1
the firm , which last week admitted it could not meet its contracted target of 10,400 guards despite employing 650,000 people worldwide , then notified the police and @entity89			2
the men , who are aged 21 and 24 , worked for @entity91 and would have been part of the effort to ' lockdown ' the venue in a bid to guard it from terror attacks			0
some @entity3 guards have also revealed they had not received schedules , uniforms or training with less than a fortnight to go until the event kicks off			1
the revelation comes after @entity105 vowed to ' go after ' @entity3 for the costs of the @entity1 security fiasco , which has seen the deployment of the extra soldiers and police to plug gaps at @entity1 venues			1
speaking on a visit to @entity115 , the prime minister saluted the military for ' stepping up to the plate ' in helping deal with the shambles left by the private security firm			0
and he said he insisted he was ' confident ' that he could meet his promise to bring @entity123 troops back from @entity115 by the end of 2014			0
looking forward : mr @entity105 meets @entity123 soldiers at @entity127 forward operating base in @entity128 , @entity115 it came as the government hinted that @entity3 would lose its £ 57million management fee for overseeing the @entity1 security operation			1
he said : ' let 's be clear , if @entity3 do n't fulfil their contract we will go after them for the money to make sure that they help pay for the military personnel that have been brought in			2
' when it was suggested @entity143 had become the ' soggy @entity1 ' , mr @entity105 launched an impassioned defence of what had been achieved , including delivering the park on time and on budget			0
' let 's not call this the wet and soggy @entity1 , it is a great moment for our country , ' he added			0
' yes , there are challenges and the military have stepped up to the plate and i salute them for it			0
let 's not call it a soggy @entity1 , let 's call it a great @entity1			0
security : armed police patrol the athletes ' village on the @entity168 ' when it comes to the @entity1 we have to be ready for any contingency			0
we have to make sure they are safe and secure @entity1			0
' i salute and applaud what the military have done to step in and i think they 're doing an excellent job			0
' if there are further steps we have to take , of course we will take them , but i think the responsibility should be for @entity3 to make sure that their people are there to provide enough security			2
' but the @entity187 are playing a vital role			0
be in no doubt whatever it takes to provide a safe and secure @entity1 , we will do it			0
' action : sports minister @entity194 ( left ) said the government would activate ' all penalty clauses ' in @entity3 ’s contract but he dismissed calls for the company 's chief executive @entity199 ( right ) to resign immediately filling in : members of the @entity202 are shown around the site of the @entity168			2
more service personnel had to be drafted in after @entity3 failed to provide enough security guards			1

the man was caught napping at the plush @entity208 in @entity8
it comes after just 17 out of 56 @entity3 guards expected to report for duty at the hotel actually presented themselves for work on monday
