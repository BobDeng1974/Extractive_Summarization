checks : of the 99 suspects , three were deported last year , 20 were refused asylum and 46 had their citizenship bids turned down but are likely to have remained in the @entity3 ( file picture ) however , human rights laws invariably mean that the worse their crimes , the more difficult it is to send them home			1
after confessing what they have done , war criminals can then claim they face death or torture if they were to be returned home			1

however , of the 99 suspects , just three were deported			0

last year , nine years after he came here , an immigration judge said evidence of his role in the atrocity was ‘ not conclusive ’ , and said he must be allowed to stay because of his right to family life			0
earlier figures suggested more than 700 suspected war criminals were identified by @entity3 immigration officials between 2005 and 2012			1
@entity131 of the @entity132 , which campaigns against international war crimes and genocide , called for prosecutions to take place in the @entity3			2
‘ there ’s a cost and it is difficult to investigate crimes which took place in another country a long time ago			0
but if we do n’t pursue those prosecutions , the @entity3 could become known as a retirement home for war criminals , ’ he said			1
@entity147 mp , chairman of a cross-party anti-genocide group , called for greater transparency over war criminals living here			1
he said : ‘ i have deep concerns that the @entity56 is n’t being as forthright as it could be and i think we should be drilling down into these cases in order to give the public that security			0
’ in may , five @entity43 men were arrested in @entity3 over suspected involvement in the 1994 genocide in the country in which an estimated 800,000 people lost their lives			1

some of the men , who deny involvement in the genocide , have been in @entity3 for more than a decade			2
one was found working in a care home in @entity173			0

‘ if they can not send the criminals to @entity43 , at least they can be tried in the @entity3			1
