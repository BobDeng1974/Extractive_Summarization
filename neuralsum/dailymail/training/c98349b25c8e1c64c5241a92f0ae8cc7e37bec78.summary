by @entity0 published : 20:18 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 02:30 est , 27 march 2013 the country ’s most senior judge yesterday dismissed murder law reforms pushed through by former labour minister @entity4 as useless			1
lord judge , the lord chief justice , said the @entity7 laws – designed to help women who kill violent boyfriends or husbands – could only very rarely influence the decisions of a judge or jury in a murder trial			1
as a result , judges had to ‘ question their purpose ’ , he said			0
lord judge , the lord chief justice ( left ) said laws pushed through by @entity4 ( right ) could only rarely influence the decisions of a judge or jury in a murder trial his ruling – delivered in the @entity24 alongside two other senior judges – effectively wrecks the @entity27 murder reforms , which were intended to make it harder for men and easier for women to escape a murder conviction			1
miss @entity4 ’s reforms , passed by @entity33 in 2009 , swept away the longstanding ‘ crime of passion ’ defence of provocation , in which defendants could claim they were driven to murder by the sexual infidelity of their spouse or partner			1
@entity27 ’s new law said the courts should not consider the effect of infidelity			2
instead , it brought in a ‘ loss of control ’ defence			0
this could be used by those who feared violence by the person they killed			0
the law designed to provide a defence for female victims of domestic violence such as @entity59 miss @entity4 , who was minister for women at the time , said her law would ‘ end the culture of excuses ’ for male killers			1
it was designed to provide a defence for female victims of domestic violence such as @entity59 , jailed for life in 1990 for murdering with a knife her husband , whom she said was a violent alcoholic			0
miss @entity59 , who became a feminist heroine , won a retrial and her conviction was reduced to manslaughter six years later			0
the first part of the @entity7 law , which was meant to abolish the crime of passion , was overthrown by the @entity24 last year when judges , including lord judge , said that for the courts to ignore infidelity was ‘ unrealistic and carries with it the potential for injustice ’			2
yesterday lord judge , sitting with @entity88 and mr justice @entity89 , shot down the second half of miss @entity4 ’s law			1
the ruling came as the three appeal judges considered claims from three killers – all men – that their murder convictions should be overturned because of the new ‘ loss of control ’ defence			0
the judges rejected the appeals by @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			0
lord judge said that the laws introduced by @entity7 could be considered by the courts only in circumstances ‘ much more limited than the equivalent provisions in the former provocation defence ’			1
otherwise , he said , the loss of control defence would succeed whenever someone accused of murder declared in court that ‘ the circumstances caused me to have what i believed was a justifiable sense that i had been seriously wronged ’			0
lord judge said : ‘ if so , when it is clear that the availability of a defence based on the loss of control has been significantly narrowed , one would have to question the purpose of the law			2

the lord chief justice said the @entity7 laws could very rarely influence decisions of a judge or jury in a murder trial
miss @entity4 ’s reforms were passed by @entity33 in 2009
