thanks to recent tragic anorexia deaths and several high profile campaigns , seeing a scarily skinny model on the catwalk is becoming an increasingly rare event			1
but while womenswear designers have taken a step in the right direction , it seems the same can not be said for those behind men 's fashion collections			2
a photo of a shockingly thin male model on the catwalk at @entity16 was tweeted by blogger @entity17 , the founder of website what i wore today			1
@entity21 : the extremely thin male model seen on the catwalk during the @entity24 show in @entity25 controversy : what i wore today founder , @entity17 , tweeted the photo and caused a @entity32 storm ' woefully irresponsible model casting at @entity16 yesterday			1
' she wrote , before adding : ' @entity35 '			0
the photo of the emaciated model prompted a barrage of responses from other @entity32 users , most of whom tweeted their support and horror @entity16 's use of the gaunt model			1
but in a disturbing twist , others weighed in in favour of looking extremely thin , with one user - who outs herself as ' pro ana ' in her @entity32 handle - arguing that despite appearances , @entity17 should have made clear that he ' is n't ill '			1
the woman added : ' have you thought how he 'd feel if he saw this ? he has absolutely nothing wrong			0
' ' i have had hundreds of replies but have n't seen a single response that says they think it looks healthy or acceptable , although plenty of fashiony friends enjoyed the collection itself - which people seem to be forgetting about , ' said @entity17			2
' what did upset me was the number of people who said the model was ' disgusting ' - i made a point of saying you ca n't assume that the model has an eating disorder			1
' i have been to hundreds of fashion shows so i 'm never particularly surprised by the latest ' shock model picture ' but casting directors have to take some responsibility			2
' a model may well be healthy , but if someone looking at the pictures will assume the opposite , why not cast someone who does n't create such controversy ? ' healthy : the world 's highest earning male model , @entity86 , is toned and muscly rather than skinny clean living : in equally good shape are fellow male supermodels , @entity91 ( pictured with girlfriend , @entity92 ) and @entity93 ( seen here with ex , @entity95 ) the gaunt - faced model is a far cry from the healthy - looking male models who have dominated the industry in recent years			2
high - earning male models such as @entity86 , @entity93 and @entity91 have set an industry standard geared towards the fit and healthy rather than the emaciated			0
but the appearance of the emaciated model suggests times could be changing and that 's worrying - particularly at a time when male anorexia or ' manorexia ' is becoming more widespread			0
according to recent figures released by eating disorders charity , b - eat , the number of male anorexics , previously thought to total just 10 per cent of total sufferers , has shot up			1
male sufferers now account for a quarter of all disordered eating cases but often find themselves struggling with the disease alone thanks to a lack of awareness about the disease and how it affects men			1
' all too often eating disorders are seen as a young girl ’s illness , ' says b - eat spokeswoman , @entity126			0
' there is still a great deal of misunderstanding and stigma surrounding these serious psychiatric conditions which makes it even more difficult for a male to admit to having the problem and seeking help			0
' much better : normal sized models on the runway at @entity137 ( left ) and @entity138 ( right ) and , while the sight of models such as the one seen at @entity16 are n't directly to blame , according to @entity126 , they certainly do n't help			0
' the fashion industry does n’t cause eating disorders			0
it does , however , have a powerful influence that is highly toxic to some vulnerable people			0
' people have told us these images alone do not cause their eating disorder but it can make it harder for people to recover			1
' adds @entity17 : ' it 's unfair on the fashion industry to say that all designers are peddling an unhealthy ideal , as the majority of designers and casting directors will be doing their utmost to only book healthy models			2
' catwalk models are n't like your average attractive guy or girl from school - they fit a very narrow ideal of height and weight and some people are just naturally that thin			0
' the problem is , impressionable people across the world see these images and aspire to be like this - when it would take nothing short of starvation to achieve the same shape - and that 's forgetting they 're probably four inches too short to model anyway			0
' well , the models look fine ... but the clothes certainly do n't ! more bizarre fashion on the @entity25 catwalk at @entity186 ( left ) and @entity187 ( right ) while @entity189 remains the only one to have banned very thin models , the @entity188 has taken steps to ensure that model 's heath is a priority for @entity196 designers and brands alike			1
the main provisions include : in addition to the regulations produced by the @entity188 , @entity201 , the performing arts union has established a model section recognising modelling as a profession on a par with acting and dance			0
the @entity188 has also funded an eating disorder awareness seminar for model agencies staff delivered by eating disorders charity , b - eat			1
