advertising portrayals branded ' depressing , manipulative and hopeless ' by @entity1 published : 06:59 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 08:21 est , 27 december 2012 @entity4 stereotypes of @entity5 are no longer moving the @entity7 public and leaving people on the continent starving , @entity2 has warned			1
the aid agency said the public must shake - off the portrayals of @entity5 promoted by the celebrity - driven campaigns of the 1980s and 2004			1
@entity2 stressed the majority of people have become desensitised to images depicting issues such as hunger , drought and disease			1
hunger : the public has become desensitised to images such as this of famine and drought in @entity25 over-exposure to negative media and advertising portrayals of @entity5 and developing countries in other parts of the world was described as ' depressing , manipulative and hopeless ' by respondents to a @entity34 survey of more than 2,000 people			1
nearly 50 per cent of those polled said it made them feel that conditions for people living in the developing world would never improve			0
when asked to select what they thought were the three most pressing problems facing @entity5 over the next year , almost half identified hunger			1
and although 74 per cent thought it was ultimately possible to bring an end to hunger in @entity5 , only one in five believe they could play an active role in this			1
' give us your money ' : @entity4 stars ( left to right ) @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 in response , @entity2 is launching a new campaign to try to refocus public support for the cause			1
through the food for all campaign , the charity aims to show the continent 's potential instead of just its problems by striking a more optimistic tone			0
it comes 18 years after @entity58 and @entity73 formed super group @entity4 and released do they know it 's @entity75 ? to help tackle famine in @entity25			0
the campaign was revived in 1989 and again in 2004			0
@entity2 chief executive , @entity77 , said : ' @entity2 has led the way in drawing attention to the plight of @entity5 's most vulnerable people and we are n't trying to gloss over the problems that still beset so many of them , particularly levels of malnutrition that remain stubbornly high			0
malnourished : refugees wait for their daily ration of corn porridge at a refugee camp in @entity91 ' but we 've come a long way since the 1980s and @entity4 's do they know it 's @entity75 ? we need to shrug off the old stereotypes and celebrate the continent 's diversity and complexity , which is what we are attempting with this campaign			0
' the relentless focus on ongoing problems at the expense of a more nuanced portrait of the continent , is obscuring the progress that is being made towards a more secure and prosperous future			0
' if we want people to help fight hunger we have to give them grounds for hope by showing the potential of countries across @entity5 ; it 's a natural instinct to turn away from suffering when you feel you can do nothing to alleviate it			2
' in another recent @entity2 poll , when asked to name the first thing that springs to mind when thinking of @entity5 , more than half of 1,295 respondents spontaneously mentioned issues relating to hunger , famine or poverty			2
