@entity0 is an interviewer , programme - maker and football expert for @entity3 by @entity0 former @entity4 captain @entity0 runs the rule over @entity4 's most threatening opponents from a group containing @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 ... and how to stop them at the @entity11			1
a brilliant nuisance ! @entity4 's best hope of stopping @entity14 is to let him make his move first and then react the man is a nuisance			1
a brilliant nuisance , but an absolute pain because he never stops running at you			0
every time he gets the ball , he asks you questions as a defender			2
he has an uncanny way of playing that i ’ve never seen before — trying to run the ball through you , either with a nutmeg or by kicking the ball at your legs knowing you wo n’t expect it , and he then picks up the ricochet			2
and when he ’s past you and in sight of goal he pulls the trigger			0
will he , wo n't he ? @entity14 is facing a race against time to be fit for the @entity11 following knee surgery as defenders we always move our feet , it ’s like a mantra			1
having the ball kicked at your feet is confusing ! the way to stop him is to let him make his move and , aware he ’ll perhaps try to knock it past , take it away			1
but it ’s not easy			0
he ’s a livewire , a fan of the feint and shot , and dangerous from many positions			0
as a defender , i ’d normally be 25 - 30 yards away from @entity65 ’s sphere of operations as the heartbeat of his club and country			1
but having faced him and watched him up close for many years , i know he can put the ball on a sixpence from anywhere			0
@entity8 's heartbeat : @entity65 's can be stopped by sitting on him and not allowing him to to distribute the ball i ’m always thinking of the space behind me when he ’s on the field because if the opposition have a runner down the channels — @entity82 for @entity8 , for example , who gave @entity4 the runaround at @entity85 — then the runner is @entity65 ’s moving target			1
@entity65 is awesomely good and can slice you open with a kick			2
from 50 yards he can send a killer ball behind a defence			0
that combination of a runner in behind and the laser ball are a nightmare to defend			0
so how do you stop him ? you sit on him ! you stop him getting the ball or block him distributing it			2
left - footed @entity99 : @entity4 should not take @entity10 forward @entity100 for granted in @entity101 there ’s a truism of no easy games in football and that ’s never more true than the @entity11			1
so @entity4 ca n’t take anything for granted against @entity10 and their major threat , if firing , will be @entity100			1
he ’s undoubtedly talented , a left - footed @entity99 almost			0
great technique and stronger than he looks .			0
