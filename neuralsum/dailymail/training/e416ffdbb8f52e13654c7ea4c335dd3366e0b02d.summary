@entity0 made the most of his @entity2 return - scoring twice in their pre season opener - with @entity4 also on target as @entity7 's side ran out 3 - 1 winners against @entity9			1
the @entity2 boss admitted this week that his high earners could make a return to the side with owner @entity14 desperate to sell , and he was true to his word as another outcast , @entity17 , laid on the equaliser for @entity0			0
@entity2 's Â£ 24million record signing @entity0 spent last season on loan at @entity22 , while @entity17 has yet to make a competitive appearance in @entity7 's two years at @entity24 due to his high wages			1
returning heroes : @entity17 and @entity0 celebrate the third and final goal of @entity2 's win @entity29 and blue : @entity30 was making his first appearance in a @entity2 shirt as the side 's chief playmaker but it was n't all about returning stars - @entity30 and @entity37 made their debuts at the @entity39 , with the former deployed in the no 10 role that he has long craved to play in			1
despite the strong side put out by @entity7 and new assistant @entity45 , the @entity43 side led at the break through an @entity48 header			0
but @entity0 made the difference in an entirely changed second half line - up , tapping home a @entity17 cut - back to equalise on 61 minutes			0
@entity4 put @entity2 in front in the 85th minute and @entity0 scored his second when he headed home an @entity57 cross in the final minute			2
cheers : @entity0 sent out his thanks to the supporters after his two - goal haul early test : @entity63 fends off a challenge during the 3 - 1 win assessing : new assistant @entity45 and manager @entity7 watched on as @entity2 won 3 - 1 at @entity9			0
