by @entity0 when i introduced my boyfriend @entity2 to my father , i desperately hoped they ’d get on			1
i feared my dad might take umbrage at his modest job as a hotel receptionist , or his thick @entity10 accent — but i could never have predicted what actually set him off : @entity2 ’s looks			1
‘ he ’s very handsome , ’ said @entity12			1
‘ are you sure he ’s faithful to you ? ’ this was three years ago and @entity15 and i were in a long - distance relationship at the time			1
i lived in @entity19 , he was 650 miles away in @entity20 , and my father simply could n’t accept that ‘ someone as good - looking as @entity2 ’ would n’t be cheating on me at every opportunity			1
hot topic : @entity0 and ' @entity24 ' @entity2 i was devastated that he could say something so insensitive , and offended because i was very aware he would n’t have said it had my boyfriend looked like @entity27			1
a wave of insecurity flooded over me			2
what did @entity2 , now 38 see in a diminutive , curly - haired specimen like me ? at 6ft 2in tall , with broad shoulders , black hair , a roman nose and incredible blue eyes , @entity2 is the living embodiment of tall , dark and handsome			1
he is n’t just good - looking , he ’s movie - star handsome			1
at college , he was picked to play @entity39 in a @entity41 adaptation and he ’s been approached by model scouts wanting to sign him up			2
i know i sound smug , but bear with me			2
because having a handsome boyfriend is n’t all it is cracked up to be			1
as i ’ve learned to my cost , people make assumptions about good - looking men			1
most of them , in my experience , are false and offensive			2
just as blonde women are pigeon - holed as being stupid , handsome men are written off as lacking moral fibre			1
most people assume they ca n’t be trusted around the opposite sex			2
they are also assumed to be shallow , vain and sex - obsessed			1
as a drop - dead gorgeous man ’s girlfriend you have to be tough			1
you need a thick skin , high self - esteem and the ability not to care what other people think			1
unfortunately for me , i possess none of these qualities			2
to paraphrase the 18th - century novelist , @entity71 : ‘ @entity68 boyfriends often make a girlfriend ’s heart ache			1
’ @entity2 constantly tells @entity0 shes pretty and says all his friends and family think so , too			1
he even loves her ' gappy teeth and big nose ' especially if said girlfriend is 42 , 5ft 3in , with a big nose , hair that ’s prone to frizz and gappy teeth			1
i ’ve never had a problem attracting men , but i ’m not conventionally beautiful and certainly not leading - lady material — unless that leading lady is @entity85			1
in a romcom , i ’d be the kooky best friend , not the girl who gets the guy			2
if i were to award myself marks out of ten , i ’d be a six — six - and - a - half on a good - hair day			1
@entity2 would be a nine			2
in other words , he ’s ‘ out of my league ’			2
but he does n’t seem to care			0
more important to us is the silly sense of humour we share that can have us both in fits for hours			0
he constantly tells me i ’m pretty and says all his friends and family think so , too			1
he even loves my gappy teeth and big nose			0
now , that should be enough should n’t it ? and , most of the time , it is			0
i know , without a doubt , that @entity2 loves me			0
we ’ve been through a lot together , including the stillbirth of our daughter 18 months ago			0
he ’s given up his job at a hotel in @entity20 , his friends and his home country , and moved to @entity19 to live with me in @entity114			0
so i know i should n’t feel insecure			0
men who feel they 've ' lucked out ' by marrying attractive women are more likely to care about their wives ' needs , says a @entity120 study we live in a shallow , looks - obsessed society , in which being beautiful is the most valuable currency			1
people stare at us in the street and — call me paranoid — i can tell that some of them are wondering what someone so handsome is doing with ordinary little me			1
through the grapevine , i ’ve heard reports of acquaintances making nasty , jealous comments about us , such as : ‘ she ’s punching above her weight			0
’ although all of my previous partners have been attractive in my eyes , until @entity2 i ’d never had a partner universally considered handsome			1
everyone , from friends — both straight and gay — to my 95 - year - old grandma , has commented on his good looks			1
friends have even nicknamed him ‘ @entity24 ’			0
several have even sent me emails — usually drunken — which begin : ‘ i know this is probably really inappropriate , but can i just say that your boyfriend is really hot			1
’ sometimes this makes me feel like i ’m the owner of a prize bull at the county fair			0
people have actually congratulated me on my ‘ achievement ’ , as though snaring a good - looking man is like winning an award , or gaining a promotion			1
pleasing as it is that other people appreciate my good taste and good fortune , all this hyperbole means i ’m only too aware that if our relationship were ever to go wrong , there would be a long queue of women ready to take my place			1
i ’m not naturally jealous , but it ’s hard not to look over my @entity171 then there are @entity2 ’s beautiful exes who , through no fault of their own , make me feel inferior			0
at least two of his ex-girlfriends have modelled			0
he ’s still good friends with one of them : a tall , sexy , willowy girl , ten years my junior , with thighs the size of my arms and men trailing in her wake wherever she goes			1
‘ i ’m with you , not her , ’ @entity2 pointed out , when in a moment of weakness i confessed my sense of inadequacy			0
but sometimes — usually when i ’m contemplating my cellulite or finding a new grey hair — i ca n’t help wondering why a man who could have someone like her would want someone like me			1
@entity0 says : ' several have even sent me emails - usually drunken - which begin : ' i know this is probably really inappropriate , but can i just say that your boyfriend is really hot ' i also worry more than i should — or ever have before — about getting fat , developing wrinkles and becoming middle - aged			1
@entity2 reassures me by saying how much he loves my eyes and my smile , and reminding me that he ca n’t keep his hands off me			0
he talks of growing old with me and i know that , being @entity10 , he thinks older women can be just as attractive as younger ones			0
supermodels are n’t even to his taste — he finds the majority superficial and lacking in character			0
to state the obvious , a good - looking man is no different from any other man , and a handsome face and a good character are n’t mutually exclusive			1
as i pointed out to my dad , just because good looks afford you more opportunities to cheat , it does n’t mean that you ’ll take them			1
if anything , i think the opposite is true			0
when you are attractive , and you can have pretty much anyone you want , there ’s less motivation to do so			0
in my experience , it ’s the insecure men , the ones who are n’t confident in themselves or their looks , who need to chat up women in order to prove their own self - worth			2
that ’s why so many balding , paunchy men have mid-life crises and go after younger women			0
@entity2 knows he ’s handsome , but he is n’t arrogant , or vain			1
he cares about his appearance , but is n’t obsessed with it			0
he has the confidence and self - assurance of someone who has never had to try too hard			2
believe it or not , he tells me he ’s never actively chatted anyone up and can only remember one occasion when he was rejected by a woman			0
if he likes someone , and they ’re single , it usually goes without saying they will like him back			0
the downside is that he ’s been sexually harassed by strange women in bars ( one thought it was fine to stroke him , without even saying hello first ) , and he often has to fend off the attentions of men , too			0
being handsome can be dangerous			2
@entity2 spent a week in hospital , and still has a pin in his jaw , after being punched — from behind — by a man who took offence when he made polite smalltalk with the man ’s girlfriend			2
in some workplaces , he has been met with cold , aggressive behaviour from other guys			0
one colleague told him : ‘ if i had a face like yours , i ’d keep my mouth shut			0
’ a former friend admitted he liked going out with @entity280 , not so much because he enjoyed his company , but because it helped him to pull women			0
as a friendly , loyal and sociable person , @entity2 finds these attitudes hard to deal with — and so do i. but it might not be a problem for too much longer			0
even movie star looks fade			0
as he nears the end of his 30s , he has started to sprout random hairs from his ears , is growing wayward , @entity293 eyebrows , and he is battling against the development of the family double chin			0
he is near - sighted , suffers from a bad back and his love for @entity10 food and wine means that he does n’t have anything resembling a six pack			2
and for these flaws , i am truly thankful			0
the fact is i do n’t love @entity2 because he ’s handsome , although it does n’t hurt			2
i love him because he ’s funny , kind and thoughtful			0
it ’s when i ’m lying in his arms , in the dark — when i ca n’t see him — that i am at my most content			0
as the old proverb goes : ‘ @entity308 is as handsome does			2
’ i am absolutely certain that if he lost his looks tomorrow , i ’d love him as much as ever			0

@entity0 , 42 , says a handsome boyfriend comes with problems
says their relationship is constantly judged by others
many ask question if he is a cheater or vain
to go out with a good - looking man , @entity0 says you need thick skin
