a church has had its application to retune its 282 - year - old bells turned down because the ' old - sounding ring ' should be preserved			1
@entity4 , in @entity5 , @entity6 , had applied to have its bells , which have not been rung for 30 years , retuned as part of a wholescale refurbishment			1
the six bells were slightly out of key and had not been tuned for more than 250 years , but in a rare ruling @entity12 , deputy chancellor of @entity13 and a judge of the @entity16 's @entity15 , decreed that they must not be fixed			1
@entity4 , in @entity5 , @entity6 , had applied to have its bells , which have not been rung for 30 years , retuned as part of a wholescale refurbishment the ancient bells were installed at the church in 1732 and have chimed the same notes since			1
however , @entity13 's @entity22 ( @entity23 ) , which oversees around 400 churches , recommended they should be re-tuned to make their peel more melodious			0
the church agreed that now was a good time to do so , as the bells has to be temporarily removed while the building was refurbished			2
but deputy chancellor @entity12 refused permission on the basis that sounds of the past - melodious or otherwise - should be preserved for posterity as they were			2
rules on @entity37 churches dictate that all major work has to go through a @entity23 , who check over the plans before passing on the final decision to a chancellor			0
chancellors , who are often former @entity44 judges , then make the call on whether the plans are in the interest of the @entity16			2
turning down the call for re-tuning , deputy chancellor @entity12 said he found it ' a little troubling ' that the @entity23 had called for the tune - up ' on the basis that if an old thing can be ' improved ' by being modernized , it should be '			1
he continued : ' tuning bells is irreversible			0
we do not have many sounds preserved from before the days of sound recordings and those that survive are a valuable part of our heritage			1
' he added : ' irreversible tuning of a complete old ring is a serious matter , not merely to be accepted ' on the nod			0
' the six bells were slightly out of key and had not been tuned for more than 250 years , but it was decreed that they must not be fixed ( file picture ) he said that the ring of the bells at @entity4 appeared to be untouched , save for the effect of a crack on one bell which is to be repaired by welding and which will then sound more or less the same again			1
' if the bells are then restored for ringing the sound they make will be the same as when they were installed in 1732			2
that is something to be valued and to be proud of , ' he said			0
he said that he would not rule out re-tuning if the bells were so bad that ' the mission of the @entity16 was affected ' , if they ' let the church down in some way ' or if bell - ringers were reluctant to ring them			1
but he continued : ' there is no suggestion of that here			0
indeed it is not apparent whether the parish even realise that they have an early - eighteenth century sound that they propose to destroy			0
' the mere fact that the bells are not listed for preservation is not a reason for not preserving their sound where the work is not shown to be necessary			0
' grandmother @entity106 , 65 , who lives and works on a farm near the church with her husband @entity109 , 67 , said she was looking forward to hearing the bells when they are put to use , as they have not been rung for 30 years			1
' i quite like the sound of the bells , so they wo n't bother me even if they are a little out of tune			2
' my in - laws are buried in the churchyard so we have a strong connection			0
we got to the harvest festival and at @entity122			0

@entity16 *barred* from re-tuning its bells so their ' old ring ' can be preserved
the 282 - year - old bells have not had a tune - up since they were fitted in 1732
the six bells in the small church in @entity6 have not rung for 30 years
@entity134 *wanted* to fix the bells as part of refurbishment of whole church
but judge ruled that the bells were ' a valuable part of our heritage '
