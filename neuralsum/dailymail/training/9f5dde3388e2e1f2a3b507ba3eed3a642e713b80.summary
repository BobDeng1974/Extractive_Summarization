a furious @entity0 yesterday attacked @entity3 ’s @entity2 votes plan and warned he was jeopardising the ‘ still fragile ’ @entity4			2
in an outspoken attack on his successor , the former prime minister accused the @entity8 of playing into the @entity9 ’ hands and warned : ' @entity11 can be lost by accident			2
' he warned that their income tax proposals were ‘ 100 per cent wrong ’ and risk destroying @entity18 ’s relationship with the rest of the @entity20			1
former prime minister @entity0 has called the @entity8 ' income tax proposals ' 100 per cent wrong ' mr @entity0 wrestled back the referendum debate after a late surge by the separatists last month and – despite not being nominated by @entity25 to be part of the @entity27 on new powers for @entity18 – has submitted his own personal views			1
he believes @entity18 should be responsible for raising 54 per cent of the money it spends but rejects @entity32 proposals to give it complete control of income tax			1
‘ it just does not make sense to devolve 100 per cent of income tax to the @entity18 parliament , ’ the @entity25 mp for @entity36 and @entity37 said yesterday			1
‘ the conservatives have got this wrong			0
they are 100 per cent wrong			1
‘ they ’ve got to understand that their measures are a gift to the separatists , they would play into the hands of the @entity50			0
‘ they would drive a wedge between @entity18 and @entity53 and make the constitution unstable			1
‘ i will be saying that during the course of this week when i put forward my own proposals about how to solve this problem			0
i think what the @entity32 have to realise is what is at stake here is the future of the @entity20			0
‘ there are grievances as a result of what mr @entity3 said the day after the referendum			0
i think he did so in an unstatesmanlike way and he should regret what he did			0
’ he added : ‘ i think the @entity32 have to think again about playing fast and loose with the constitution			0
@entity11 can be lost by accident ; unions can disintegrate because mistakes were made			0
’ just hours after @entity18 decisively rejected independence , mr @entity3 linked the promise of further powers for @entity80 with @entity2 votes for @entity82			2
the proposals would limit the role of @entity18 mps in @entity2 issues that have been devolved – such as health and education			2
it would cause huge problems for @entity25 , which has 41 @entity18 mps			2
it could be in power in @entity93 but in a minority in @entity53			0
mr @entity0 fears that the full devolution of income tax would further limit the role of @entity18 mps and make it easier for the @entity98 to argue for independence			1
mr @entity0 has accused @entity3 of jeopardising the ' still fragile ' @entity4 in his submission to the commission , he warns : ‘ full devolution of income tax rates and bands does not sit easily with the wish to maintain the @entity4 and to prevent a wedge being driven between @entity18 and @entity53			1
‘ @entity4 is based on the pooling and sharing of resources and that is why the @entity112 – with its responsibilities for macroeconomic management and redistribution – must play a role in relation to income tax			1
‘ leaving @entity119 at @entity93 with no influence over income tax in @entity18 could undermine the political union , by calling into question the legitimacy of tax decisions which today affect the whole @entity20			1
’ @entity126 has claimed the @entity27 should deliver everything except foreign affairs and defence – far more than any party set out before the referendum			0
‘ their plan adds up to separation by another route , ’ mr @entity0 said at the weekend			0
the @entity18 @entity8 – who are represented by former leader @entity137 and professor @entity138 on the commission – have indicated they are prepared to add to their offer by saying it represents ‘ a floor , not a ceiling ’			1
a party spokesman said : ‘ we think income tax should be devolved with no strings attached and look forward to trying to persuade others – including mr @entity0 – of that case			1
‘ we go into these negotiations open - minded and have made clear that the @entity151 proposals are very much a basis rather than a limit			0
these proposals were meticulously considered over the course of more than a year and we are confident they are the best way forward			0
’ meanwhile , the @entity98 believes mr @entity0 has backtracked on his rhetoric before the referendum , when he talked of a ‘ modern form of @entity18 home rule ’			1
@entity162 , @entity163 mp for @entity164 and @entity165 , described mr @entity0 ’s contributions to the debate on @entity18 ’s future as ‘ increasingly surreal ’ and ‘ full of inconsistencies and contradictions ’			2
he said : ‘ before the referendum , @entity0 posed as a guarantor of the “ vow ” – the promise to deliver wide - ranging new powers to @entity80 – but then resorted to asking people to sign a petition to ensure its delivery			0
‘ he is now calling on other @entity93 parties to do more – but his own party ’s proposals for more powers are even weaker than the @entity8 ’ or the @entity183 ’			2
‘ mr @entity0 attacks plans to give @entity18 all control of income tax , even suggesting they are a “ trojan horse ” to deliver full fiscal autonomy – but if he was in any way consistent with the pre-referendum vow to the people of @entity18 , he would be throwing all his weight behind full fiscal autonomy for @entity80			1

@entity0 says @entity8 ' income tax proposals are ' 100 per cent wrong '
the proposals would ' drive a wedge between @entity18 and @entity53 '
@entity18 should be responsible for raising 54 per cent of money it spends
but he says it ' does not make sense ' to devolve all tax to @entity18 parliament
