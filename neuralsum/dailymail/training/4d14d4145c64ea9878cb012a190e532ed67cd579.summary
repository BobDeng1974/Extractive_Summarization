coroner dr @entity54 said he would write to the @entity1 to suggest it publishes the same extensive warnings about bus travel as it does about motorcycle travel			1
recording narrative verdicts , he said the trio were on board a @entity63 tourist bus which was just leaving a petrol station where it had stopped for a break			2
' the bus in which the deceased was travelling took a wrong turn exiting the petrol station to make a u-turn in a turning point in the middle of the highway , placing it in the path of another bus which was overtaking at the time , ' he said			1

after the hearing , @entity18 's mother @entity82 said : ' we want them ( the @entity1 ) to update their website to include the fact that the roads are hugely dangerous			1
' we would like the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) to update its website to the level that the @entity107 does , indicating that it 's extremely dangerous travelling by road			1
' the inquest heard a statement from @entity112 , now 20 , who was on the trip with the trio before they started university			0
he said they had booked their flights , but no other transport , and had been in @entity41 for four days when they bought their coach tickets to @entity21 from an internet cafe for the equivalent of £ 5 to £ 10			2
' we hoped to travel around all of south - east @entity124 and did not really research transport in @entity11 before we went on holiday , ' he said			2
he added that they still probably would have taken the same trip if they had known the risks , but would have ' thought twice about buying the cheapest tickets '			0
the inquest heard the teenagers were picked up in the evening			0
' the coach was very basic , the air conditioning did n't work and it was clear the coach was old , ' he said			2
' i do n't remember there being any seatbelts on the coach			2
' he explained that they stopped twice and the second time pulled into a petrol station where they got some ' disgusting ' food			0
as they pulled out of the petrol station , mr @entity112 said he remembered the driver stopping for what he thought was too long , as there was little traffic on the road			0
' i ca n't think of any reason for the coach to wait as long as it did , i did n't see any traffic , and i think the coach could have turned right immediately , ' he said			2
he described seeing lights approach the coach , ' all of a sudden that coach crashed into our coach '			2
' it happened so quickly we did n't have time to move from our seats or brace ourselves , ' he said			0

advice : coroner dr @entity54 , sitting at @entity179 , pictured , said he would write to the @entity1 to suggest it publishes the same extensive warnings about bus travel as it does about motorcycle travel @entity185 is reported to have been jailed for two years for driving offences after the accident - the inquest only heard there had been a ' successful prosecution ' in the case			1
@entity191 , @entity16 's mother , said she had left the boys to their preparations and said she had ' presumed wrongly ' that coaches would be regulated			1
she said figures suggested there were around 12,000 people killed in accidents each year in @entity11 , compared to 3,000 in the @entity174 , and claimed these figures were ' massaged ' to make them less damning			0
ms @entity191 told the inquest she wanted the foreign office to ' take responsibility for their @entity174 citizens '			0
' it would not take much , just a paragraph stating specifically that there 's a huge amount of unregulated transport out there , ' she said			0
@entity21 : the boys had been heading to the northern @entity11 city , 422 miles north of @entity41 ' i had an idea of every other danger except buses , travelling by road , apart from motorcycles			0
' mr @entity18 died of a severe head injury , mr @entity220 died of multiple injuries , and mr @entity17 died of a head injury			1
coroner dr @entity54 said : ' this has been a harrowing and tragic inquest			0
' it 's never easy to hear an inquest into the deaths of young people			0
' he said he would write to the @entity1 , telling the court : ' it does seem to me to be a reasonable and sensible solution to make that i could ask the @entity1 that if they have any evidence of unregulated bus travel that they should give the same warning for bus travel as they do for motorcycles			1

@entity244 was killed with @entity16 and @entity17 when their coach *swung* into the path of an oncoming bus
