by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 22:02 est , 24 february 2014 @entity4 : 10:46 est , 25 february 2014 @entity5 kicked things off with his new job as host of @entity9 on monday with the help of vice president @entity11 , who skillfully laughed off questions about his designs on the @entity14			1
@entity5 asked @entity11 about his 2016 intentions while comedian @entity16 stood gamely by to help break in the stage with her fellow @entity21 alum			1
' well you know i was planning on making a major announcement tonight , ' said the vice president in reply , ' but i decided tonight is your night			1
' scroll down for @entity28 ' well you know i was planning on making a major announcement tonight , ' the vice president joked to newly minted @entity9 host @entity5			1
' but i decided tonight is your night			0
' as he explained to @entity5 , ‘ so i hope you 'll invite me back			1
’ @entity5 takes over for new @entity35 host @entity34 and managed to get through the opening - night butterflies with practiced ease and charm			1
his debut was the final piece in a late night shakeup at @entity42 in the wake of host @entity45 's retirement			2
when @entity11 arrived to join first guest poehler , it made for a cozy trio			1
after all , @entity11 and @entity16 have a history of their own , reaching back to his cameo appearance last season on her @entity42 sitcom ‘ @entity54			1
’ ‘ @entity16 really helped me with the @entity55 , ’ said @entity11 , who reported that when he had finished shooting his ‘ @entity54 ’ scene and was making his departure , the @entity57 grabbed a @entity55 agent by the lapels and demanded , ‘ you take care of him ! ’ @entity16 joked that she and @entity11 now plan to make a film together called ‘ @entity66			1
’ then she declared that she was running for president in two years			2
the premiere of ‘ @entity9 with @entity5 ’ ( which taped monday evening for airing at 12:35 a.m. est / 11:35 p.m. cst ) , represented the final step in @entity42 's talk - show turnover			1
@entity5 , who until early this month was an ‘ snl ’ veteran and co-anchor of its ‘ @entity74 ’ newscast , is filling the vacancy left by @entity34 after five years as ‘ @entity9 ’ host			1
big night : @entity11 's faux announcement came on @entity5 ' first ever episode of @entity9 , which was taped monday and scheduled to air after the @entity35 with its new host @entity34 @entity80 , of course , moved up last week to be host of ‘ @entity35 , ’ replacing @entity45			1
so far , the late - night changes are paying off			0
riding the crest of @entity42 's @entity87 coverage , ‘ @entity90 ’ was seen by an average of 8.5 million viewers in its first week , the biggest ‘ tonight ’ audience in decades			0
can the 40 - year - old @entity91 make the most of this popular lead - in ? he comes to his new role as a talk - show host with demonstrated skill and appeal from his years as an ‘ @entity21 ’ writer and performer			2
he is known as a tv star who does n't hog the spotlight and enjoys playing the straight man			0
he is also known as cerebral , which , if not moderated , could work against him : one of his monologue jokes hinged on the viewer knowing who @entity109 is			0
it was n't very funny either			0
other jokes were more successful , even if they were larded by @entity5 ' insistent pause - and - grin pacing			2
shift change : @entity5 was tapped as part of the shift change on @entity42 late night talk shows			2
with @entity45 leaving the @entity35 , @entity34 took his palce , thus leaving the @entity119 open for the @entity21 alum he announced that the brassiere turns 100 years old this week — ‘ and so does everyone who still calls it a brassiere			1
’ he noted that the @entity125 passed a bill that would allow business owners asserting their religious beliefs to deny service to gay customers : ‘ some businesses have already put up signs that read , ' @entity134 shirt , nice shoes , no service			0
' ‘ later , he took another swing at @entity138 during what may emerge as a durable humor franchise : @entity141 diagrams displaying what two seemingly different things have in common			0
one example : the intersection of @entity146 and the @entity147 was revealed to be ‘ places that are more @entity149 than @entity138			0
’ the setting for @entity5 ' ‘ @entity9 ’ is a sleek , art deco design			2
sliding screens substitute for curtains			0
as with most other talk shows , @entity5 ' format provides for a musical guest			1
on his first night , it was the band @entity158			0
speaking of music , a valuable asset is the leader of @entity5 ' house band , @entity164 , himself a musician as well as a comedian - performer — and clearly a funny sidekick			2
during a brief exchange , @entity5 , playing the able straight man , questioned @entity164 on one of his many projects , a new series on the history channel			2
‘ it 's called ' recent history , ' ‘ said @entity164 , deadpan			0
‘ it only goes back the past hour or so , but it has an historical spin			0
’ one other feature that seems to have potential : @entity91 ' skill at relating a story			0
from his desk , he told a charming anecdote about an outing with his wife that went awry			0
with apparent effortlessness , he brought the tale to a finish by observing , ‘ it 's hard to feel macho when you 're holding a tiny dog and another man is changing your wife 's tire			0
’ oddball : friend and fellow @entity21 castmember @entity164 leads @entity5 ' studio band with his characteristic strangeness and aplomb			1

@entity5 took over @entity34 's old spot starting with the first episode taped monday *afternoon*
his friend and former @entity21 *co-star* @entity16 was his first guest followed by the vice president
@entity11 *declined* to state his 2016 intentions but @entity16 declared she intends to run
