by @entity0 published : 19:23 est , 5 january 2014 updated : 06:01 est , 6 january 2014 the @entity2 says the @entity3 coped with almost 130,000 more births in 2012 than the service was designed for older mothers with high expectations are putting maternity wards under increasing strain , midwives have warned			1
the obesity epidemic is also contributing to a ' buckling ' maternity service , according to the @entity2			1
it says that the combination of a baby boom and staff shortages means the @entity3 coped with almost 130,000 more births in 2012 than the service was designed for			1
in other words , it is lacking resources to deliver one in five of the 700,000 babies born in @entity23 each year			0
in its annual @entity25 report , the @entity2 says the situation is exacerbated by growing numbers of complex pregnancies			1
there are also concerns that older mothers have idealised views about the care they should receive			0
' the importance of complexity on the midwifery workload has been often overlooked , ' says the report			0
' one example of rising complexity is the continuing growth of births to older women			2
' in 2012 , there were almost twice as many babies born to women aged over 40 than a decade earlier – the biggest rise in birth rate in any age group			2
the @entity2 says that while older women are as entitled to maternity care as their younger counterparts , they are likely to require more support during pregnancy and labour			1
they are more likely to miscarry , as well as to have complicated pregnancies and to deliver babies that are underweight or premature			0
stillbirths are more than twice as common in over- 35s than younger women , while deterioration of their eggs with time also leaves them at greater risk of having babies with @entity63 's syndrome and other genetic disorders			2
it is claimed that older mothers can also be more demanding , as they have had time to build up a ' rose - tinted ' view of the type of care they should receive			0
the obesity crisis is adding to the strain , with tens of thousands of women requiring more demanding care in pregnancy because of their weight			2
around half of women of child - bearing age are overweight or obese and more than 15 per cent of pregnant women are obese			0
figures show the @entity3 coped with almost 130,000 more births in 2012 than service was designed for ( file picture ) this raises their odds of dying in pregnancy , of their baby being stillborn and of a host of pregnancy complications			1
the @entity2 's most recent estimates suggest that there are nearly 50,000 more mothers - to - be in need of extra help because of their weight than 20 years earlier			1
and it is not just mothers that are getting older – midwives are , too			0
the largest single age group is now 45 to 49 , leading to fears that the staffing shortage will be compounded when they retire			0
the @entity2 acknowledges that midwives are being recruited			1
between may 2010 , when the @entity105 was formed , and july last year the number of full - time - midwives working in the @entity3 in @entity23 rose by 1,311 or 6.5 per cent			1
statistics from the start of 2013 also suggest that the birth rate has started to drop			0
but the @entity2 stresses that with @entity23 still 4,800 midwives short , there is no room for complacency			1
@entity115 , the @entity2 's director of midwifery , said : ' midwives in @entity23 have been run ragged for years as the number of babies born has gone up and up			1
' thousands of midwives short , as we are today , they are still running to catch up			0
' we have reached a make or break point			0
the government must continue to pump money into maternity care			0
we need determined action from the government and the @entity3			2
