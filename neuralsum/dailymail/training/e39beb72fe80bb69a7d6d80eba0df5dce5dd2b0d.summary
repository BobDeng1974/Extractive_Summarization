by @entity0 published : 20:02 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 03:23 est , 13 august 2013 @entity2 ’s spokesman refused ten times yesterday to say whether the prime minister would support fracking near his home in @entity7			1
after mr @entity2 said gas drilling should be welcomed across the country , his spokesman would not be drawn over the prospect of wells in the prime minister ’s own backyard where there are shale rocks			1
the spokesman would say only that ‘ ultimately the prime minister supports fracking ’ and there should be a ‘ dialogue with local people ’ about any attempts to extract the fuel			1
@entity2 : ' ultimately ' the prime minister supports fracking and there should be a ' dialogue with local people ' , according to his spokesman asked several times whether , as a local resident , mr @entity2 – @entity31 for @entity32 in @entity7 – would support such an application , the spokesman added : ‘ while i ’m unwilling to get into a hypothetical of where a well may or may not be opened , the point is anywhere in the country where there is that possibility of shale gas exploration taking place it is important for dialogue to take place with local people , and that is as relevant in his constituency as it would be in any area of this country			1
’ in a newspaper article published yesterday , the prime minister urged communities to ‘ seize ’ the chance to have shale gas exploration near their homes , saying drill sites are only the size of a cricket pitch and there is little evidence the process causes environmental damage or contaminates water supplies as campaigners have claimed			1
fracking could create 70,000 jobs and lower energy bills for millions , while communities which accept it will be given sweeteners of £ 100,000 for their area , he said			1
mr @entity2 points to the @entity74 where a decade of fracking has seen gas prices plummet and the country is now virtually self - sufficient in energy			1
but independent experts say it is still unclear whether it will lower bills at all in @entity82			0
anti-fracking protest at the @entity85 fracking site in @entity86 , @entity87 , yesterday earlier this year , the @entity88 released its report on shale reserves in northern @entity91 , predicting there could be 1,300trillion cubic feet of gas underground – in theory enough to meet @entity82 ’s needs for more than a century			2
but @entity96 , an energy markets experts at @entity98 , said the gas which could be extracted would at most produce 25 per cent of what is needed in the @entity82 and would ‘ not lead to a collapse in prices ’			2
in contrast , the @entity74 had a ‘ glut ’ of gas which saw prices plummet			0
fracking – short for hydraulic fracturing – involves drilling a well up to 3,000ft deep and pumping water and chemicals into it at high pressure to crack the rocks and release fuel trapped inside			0
it has so far taken place in @entity115 after a delay of some months following two small earthquakes			0
dozens more wells could be drilled there in the next two years			0
in the @entity125 , across @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity87 and @entity124 , there is also thought to be plentiful shale oil or gas , but fierce protests have accompanied the drilling of an exploratory well in the village of @entity86 , @entity132			0
last night @entity133 , leader of @entity134 , said : ‘ any applications would be considered on a case - by - case basis , but we have n’t had any so far			0
‘ personally i feel we have got an energy crisis in this country and we ’ve got to look at all forms of alternative energy , if the relevant safeguards are in place and it is not in an area of outstanding natural beauty			2
’ ÷ @entity147 said mr @entity2 would support @entity91 when they play @entity148 in a football friendly at @entity150 tomorrow			2
his spokesman initially deflected the question , but it was later conceded that he would back @entity154 ’s team .			0
