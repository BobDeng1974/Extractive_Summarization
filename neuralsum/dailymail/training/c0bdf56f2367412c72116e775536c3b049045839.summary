by @entity0 for the @entity1 doctors should order obese patients to undertake keep - fit classes in public parks , a new report says today			1
the influential think tank @entity7 urges ministers to adopt the @entity10 system of ‘ green prescriptions ’ where doctors are encouraged to try non-medical alternatives to curing problems like obesity			1
the potentially humiliating idea of forcing the overweight to exercise in public is likely to prove controversial with some			2
these include helping people lose weight without resorting to costly surgery and providing a new use for parks which could help fund their upkeep			2
so - called ‘ green prescribing ’ usually involves doctors ordering patients to undergo some form of physical activity , typically outdoors			1
‘ activities could range from intense physical exercise to horticultural work , depending on the needs and abilities of the patient , ’ the report says			1
under these proposals , the patient would pay the standard prescription charge , with the @entity55 topping up the cost of the exercise class and making a donation to the upkeep of the park			2
@entity62 prescriptions have also been used to help patients with mental health and dementia problems			1
for example , a scheme in @entity67 , in south east @entity68 , provides gardening and craft sessions in a local park for people with early - onset dementia			0
today ’s report calls on the @entity76 to now pursue the idea by running a series of pilot schemes across the country			0
' @entity81 ’ usually involves doctors ordering patients to undergo some form of physical outdoor activity to help them lose weight ( file picture ) ‘ @entity62 prescribing offers a considerable opportunity for public health funding to be used to support activities in public green spaces , ’ the report says			1
‘ as additional benefits , such an approach may contribute to the maintenance and improvement of particular spaces , and attract people who have previously used parks either rarely or not at all			0
’ the call comes in a major report on the future of @entity105 ’s urban parks , which urges ministers to investigate new ways to keep them maintained and safe			1
it suggests that local residents could be given council tax discounts in return for volunteering to clean up local parks , allotments and cemeteries			0
and it urges ministers to consider allowing residents to hold referendums on whether to impose small local levies to pay for the upkeep of parks in the area			2
the report says that funding for parks has been cut by more than 10 per cent in the last three years as council budgets have been squeezed by other priorities			0
other ideas include making it easier for people to donate money for the upkeep of a specific local park , and requiring developers to provide endowments to pay for long - term maintenance of parks in areas of new housing			0
@entity139 , author of the report , said : ‘ @entity105 ’s parks are the lungs of our great cities			1
they are an oasis of calm and tranquillity in an increasingly fast moving world			0
however , as local authority budgets have been squeezed , public funding on parks , cemeteries and allotments has declined sharply			0
‘ the time has come for radical new thinking to safeguard our parks and make them more accessible to everyone in society			0
with people ’s disposable income still under pressure a ‘ green guardian ’ scheme that rewards local volunteers to help maintain their local parks with council tax rebates is just one way of protecting and enhancing our public green spaces			2
