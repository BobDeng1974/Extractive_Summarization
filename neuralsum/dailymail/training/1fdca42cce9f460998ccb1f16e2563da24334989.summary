late : teenager @entity0 has a hospital appointment booked for the year 2099 a teenager who tried to book a consultation at hospital was told to come back for an appointment in 84 years ' time			1
@entity0 , 19 , was referred for an ultrasound scan at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 by her gp after complaining of stomach pains			1
but a month later , she received a letter telling her she had an appointment at 11am on thursday january 1 , 2099			1
the student will be 103 years old by the time she finally gets the scan - but as january 1 is a bank holiday , doctors may not even be working on that day			1
miss @entity0 was put on hold for an hour before she was able to speak to the hospital to sort out the it blunder			2
' i thought it was funny at first , i 'm not sure i can wait 84 years for a scan , ' said @entity25 , who is studying animal management			2
' but then i got quite annoyed while i was waiting on the phone			0
' it 's just a mix - up but i just wanted to get the date sorted			0
i have already had to wait a month to get the appointment and obviously i am worried about that			0
' there was n't even a clue when the appointment might be , because we are already in february so it would obviously not be in january			2
' in fact i first thought the appointment was for next january but then i read what year they put			0
' after tweeting about her bizarre experiences , miss @entity0 was given a new appointment for next tuesday			1
long wait : an extract from the letter telling miss @entity0 to come in to hospital in 84 years ' time blunder : @entity8 in @entity9 admitted that the letter was in fact the result of a clerical error but she said : ' the appointment they have given me is when i start my work experience , and i am unable to have time off , so i will have to rearrange again			1
' @entity57 and @entity58 said : ' we 're very grateful to @entity0 for alerting us to this problem , which is clearly a clerical error			0
' we know that sometimes our patients have to wait a few weeks for their appointments , but 2099 is stretching it somewhat			0
' we 've now agreed the details of her appointment with @entity67 directly - it will take place in a few days			0
