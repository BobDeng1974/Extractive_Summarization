by @entity0 regulators have been accused of not doing enough to curb payday lenders after new rules were unveiled which did not include a ban on advertising or a cap on sky - high interest rates			1
lenders will have to ensure that only borrowers who can afford to repay their debts , and will only be allowed to roll over loans twice , the @entity9 announced today			1
the @entity9 also plans to restrict the number of recurring payments payday firms are allowed to collect following complaints that they are unexpectedly draining borrowers ' bank accounts			1
but mps and campaigners complained that lenders would be ' happy ' to hear of the new rules , claiming they do not represent a fundamental challenge to the controversial industry			2
crackdown : payday lenders will have to check their customers are credit - worthy under new rules the proposed rules will come into effect next april , when the regulator begins overseeing the consumer credit market , including payday lenders			1
there had been speculation that the @entity9 might ban such lenders from advertising their products , but instead it will have enhanced powers to ban misleading ads. payday firms have become increasingly controversial thanks to the rise of online lender @entity41 , which the archbishop of @entity44 vowed to ' compete out of existence '			1
@entity48 mp @entity47 , who has campaigned against payday loans , said she would not be declaring victory and suggested that the public would be ' horrified to hear just how happy the legal loan shark industry is '			2
she told @entity54 's today programme : ' if we do n't act now to change this , i 'm convinced this is going to be the next @entity60 scandal			0
' people are n't borrowing for luxury			0
it 's not that they have options , it 's that people need to pay their rent			0
i think we have to look at how we make sure people access affordable credit			0
the evidence for other countries is that capping does work			0
' controversy : firms like @entity41 have been thrust into the spotlight over the past few months unite general secretary @entity75 criticised the government 's ' shameful failure to act swiftly ' and called for a cap to be placed on the interest rates that payday lenders can charge			1
' these measures are too little too late and will do nothing to stop people falling prey to shady parasitic practices of payday lenders over the coming months , ' he said			1
' they tinker at the margins and do nothing to address the reasons people fall into hardship and the clutches of payday lenders			1
' @entity9 chief executive @entity95 said : ' we believe that payday lending has a place - many people make use of these loans and pay off their debt without a hitch , so we do n’t want to stop that happening			2
' but this type of credit must only be offered to those that can afford it and payday lenders must not be allowed to drain money from a borrower ’s account			1
that is why we ’re imposing tighter affordability checks , and limiting the use of rollovers and continuous payment authorities			1
' today i ’m putting payday lenders on notice : tougher regulation is coming and i expect them all to make changes so that consumers get a fair outcome			1
' outrage : mp @entity47 , left , and union boss @entity75 , right , spoke out against the new regime the @entity9 will take responsibility for regulating more than 50,000 companies in the @entity130 which offer credit to individuals			2
the new rules are subject to consultation for the next two months , and a final version will be published in february			0
while some of the rules , such as toughter affordability checks , apply to all lenders , some regulations are specific to the payday loan industry because of its ' higher - risk business '			1
for example , borrowers will only be allowed to ' roll over ' their loans twice , and any who do so will be told how to get free advice on managing their debts			2
under the @entity9 's proposals , payday firms will only be able to make two attempts to use a type of recurring payment called a continuous payment authority ( @entity156 ) to have a loan paid off			1
the @entity158 , recently carried out an investigation into payday loans , finding ' deep - rooted ' problems in the £ 2billion sector			0
it said some firms ' business models appear to be based around people who can not afford to pay their loan back , meaning they are forced to roll their loan over , the original cost balloons and they become effectively trapped with their lender			2
checks : payday lenders will have to ensure that they have investigated the finances of all borrowers consumer campaigners welcomed the plans but questioned why stronger action has not come sooner			1
@entity178 , founder of consumer help website @entity180 , said : ' @entity182 payday lenders have taken over our high streets in the last five years			1
our lax rules have made the @entity130 a crock of gold and they 've flooded in from across the world			0
' for those of us who 've been crying out for a crackdown , this hardcore regulation , while not perfect , is very welcome			0
' yet the government should be shamefaced it 's taken this long and even now it 'll be next year before the @entity9 has the authority to make this work			2
' @entity197 , executive director of which ? , said : ' our research shows millions of people are increasingly reliant on high cost loans to pay for essentials or to repay other debts , so it 's good to see the @entity9 planning to take tough action to clean up credit			2
' we welcome proposals to tackle unscrupulous payday lenders but we want the regulator to go further and use its full powers to clamp down on problems faced by struggling consumers across the credit market , like sky - high penalty charges			1
' opposition : the archbishop of @entity44 , @entity217 , has spoken out against payday lenders mr @entity95 told @entity54 's today programme that the plans will put a stop to some consumers being able to get the green light for a loan in around 10 minutes			1
he said : ' the fact you can get a loan in 10 minutes means the person lending to you is n't really doing the proper affordability checking			1
' it will be a lengthier process and arguably 10 minutes to get money for people who may not have the ability to repay is too short in any case			1
' so certainly it will be a more complex process than exists today but it should mean you are not pushing people into a spiral of debt , which is what we want to avoid			0
' mr @entity95 said a cap on the total cost of credit is also being looked at			0
he said : ' we have n't got enough data today to work out whether that would be proportionate or where to place the cap			0
' there is a place for lending in society			0
it 's not that we want to remove it entirely			0
what we want to do is to prevent the social damage it is creating for those people who really ca n't afford the loans			0
' the @entity9 also said that the fledgling peer - to - peer lending market , which involves websites matching people who want to invest some cash with borrowers , must explain the key risks of a loan before an agreement is made and assess the creditworthiness of borrowers			1
it said that a 14 - day cooling - off period should allow the borrower to withdraw if they change their mind			0
@entity277 , of the @entity278 , which represents the interests of major payday loan businesses , said a cap on interest would lead to more people turning to illegal lenders			2
he said proper checks of customers to make sure they can pay back loans are in place and can be done quickly , similar to any kind of credit product			2
he added there has been a cap preventing people from rolling over their loans more than three times			0
on a potential interest limit , mr @entity277 told today : ' i think you look around globally at other markets and see what 's happened , @entity302 and @entity303 for example - three times more people being driven to illegal lending			0
' @entity305 has just introduced one and they 've seen a growth in the illegal lending market			0
' earlier this year , archbishop @entity217 announced plans to support a new network of credit unions to compete with payday lenders , attacking firms like @entity41 for their sky - high rates of interest			1
however , @entity41 , which offers small loans via the internet , says its services are only meant for short - term borrowers and insists it represents a responsible alternative to @entity326 lenders			2
one in five payday loan customers say they were not asked about their finances when they first borrowed money , it emerged today			2
nearly a quarter of consumers surveyed for new @entity336 research said they had been put under pressure to extend their loan , despite rules agreed by the payday lending industry last year			0
while nearly all customers felt they understood the costs of taking out the initial loan , more than half said the costs of extending the debt was not explained properly			0
lenders signed up to new codes last year which promised to improve the affordability checks they carried out and give better support to those who were struggling to pay their loans back			1
but the research found that nearly three quarters of consumers felt they were not dealt with sympathetically when in financial difficulty , and just 14 per cent had been told about free sources of debt advice			0
consumer minister @entity362 said : ' this research shows that the industry has failed to self - regulate effectively			0

@entity9 sets out new regulations for payday lenders
they will have to carry out affordability checks on all customers and will only be able to roll over debts twice
lenders restricted on withdrawing money from borrowers ' bank accounts
' if you get a loan in 10 minutes the lender is n't doing its job , ' says regulator
but mps and campaigners said the measures were ' too little , too late '
