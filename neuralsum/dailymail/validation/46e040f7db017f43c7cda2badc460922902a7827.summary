the international break is usually a time for @entity2 managers to clear their thoughts , regroup and kick on for the rest of the season			1
but with the summer transfer window fast approaching , scouting has gone into overdrive and several top clubs have players lined up for bids in june			0
so , with most nations in action over in the next week , @entity12 takes a look at where you can find your next potential star			2
@entity20 is one of several possible @entity2 signings in action over the next week @entity24 ( @entity25 ) @entity26 vs @entity27 , @entity28 the @entity25 defender has been linked with a switch to @entity31 , though it will cost @entity33 £ 37million to meet his buy - out clause			1
@entity26 play two international friendlies before the @entity36 starts this summer , and should be expected to turn on the style			0
@entity24 is a @entity31 transfer target but @entity25 wo n't let the defender go on the cheap @entity40 ( @entity41 ) , @entity42 ( @entity43 ) @entity44 vs @entity45 , @entity46 @entity31 and @entity47 are both watching @entity41 winger @entity48 , while @entity42 was watched by a @entity51 scout when @entity43 beat @entity52 at the weekend			1
@entity44 are looking to recover in their qualification for @entity55 , before a high - profile friendly against @entity58 's @entity46 side			0
can they repeat their @entity61 win ? @entity40 is enjoying a fine season with club and country and @entity47 retain an interest @entity31 scouts watched @entity43 defender @entity42 in action against @entity52 on saturday @entity68 ( @entity69 ) , @entity70 ( @entity71 ) @entity72 vs @entity46 , @entity73 @entity74 have been tracking this duo , who are still both plying their trade in their native country			1
the @entity80 came within whiskers from signing @entity70 at the end of the january transfer window last season			2
with his contract expiring this summer , the qualifier with @entity46 and friendly against @entity73 will be a good chance to impress			0
@entity70 ( right ) was minutes away from joining @entity74 during last january 's transfer window @entity68 will also be in action for @entity72 this week and is another @entity2 target @entity92 ( @entity93 ) @entity94 vs @entity95 , @entity96 @entity97 are thought to be the favourites to the sign the @entity93 right back , who has shunted @entity101 out of the side and been compared to @entity103			1
but @entity31 still hold a firm interest in him , and he is expected to start in the glamour friendly in @entity108 on thursday night			1
@entity92 has been compared to @entity103 with the @entity110 national team and has ousted @entity101 from the squad @entity112 ( @entity20 ) @entity113 vs @entity114 , @entity115 @entity112 is set to leave @entity20			1
could @entity33 finally prise away the captain he has been after ? @entity31 will be one of many clubs holding a firm eye on @entity120 's friendly with @entity114 on wednesday evening , as well as the qualifier against @entity115			2
@entity112 is set to leave @entity20 and @entity31 could pay the £ 36million fee @entity123 ( @entity93 ) @entity124 vs @entity125 , @entity126 @entity127 has been a driving force for @entity93 this season , and was a star at the @entity61 with unfancied @entity131 nation @entity124 last summer			1
@entity132 are thought to be admirers , and @entity123 will be in action in the two friendlies in the @entity136			0
@entity123 is enjoying a fine season with @entity93 and is the @entity124 national team 's star man @entity140 ( @entity141 ) @entity142 vs @entity143 , @entity144 @entity145 are thought to be the frontrunners for the former @entity148 midfielder now shining at @entity141 , but could @entity149 be tempted to go back in for @entity150 ? the @entity142 host @entity143 in a @entity151 on saturday , before a friendly away at @entity144 three days later			0
@entity140 ( second right ) has most recently been linked with a move to @entity145 @entity154 ( @entity69 ) @entity155 vs @entity156 , @entity158 - @entity157 a highly - rated centre back , @entity69 are resigned to losing @entity154 to one of the top @entity162 clubs			0
@entity163 are interested , but @entity74 and @entity164 could also place a bid this summer			1
fancy watching him in action ? @entity169 is a promising defender and will be in action for @entity171 over the international break @entity173 ( @entity174 ) @entity175 vs @entity176 , @entity177 the @entity173 saga continues			1
the holding midfielder is an ever - present in an impressive @entity174 side , but @entity2 clubs are yet to take a risk with the youngster			2
now shining for his national side too , he 'll be in action against @entity176 and the @entity177			0
@entity173 continues to be linked with several of the @entity2 's top clubs @entity187 ( @entity93 ) @entity188 vs @entity189 , @entity190 another man impressing in @entity175 , club side @entity93 say the poacher can leave if a suitable offer comes in			2
the @entity196 star has lavished praise on @entity163 in the past , and there may be scouts watching as the @entity201 nation play two friendlies in the far - east			0
@entity187 has admitted in the past that a move to @entity163 from @entity93 would interest him			0
