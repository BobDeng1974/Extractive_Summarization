one customer , who was so irate at the delays at the @entity3 , stormed into the kitchen and started shouting at the chef			1
mr @entity2 told the group they should leave if they did n’t want to pay - and all 36 got up and walked out after finishing their food and drinks			1
they were joined by another seven from a different group who took advantage of the saturday night chaos at the restaurant in @entity4 , @entity5			0
it has left mr @entity2 with an unpaid bill amounting to £ 1,128.72 , yet he has been told police ca n't help as it is ‘ a civil matter ’			1
he admitted yesterday : ' if i ’m honest , i did have a bit of a breakdown on the night			1
' i was very angry and told customers if they did n’t want to pay , they should leave			2
' on top of this , a table of seven snuck out while i was talking to the large table			0
' the thing is , the group of 36 people who took the offer and left had arrived late			0
if there was a delay , that ’s why			0
' even if you do n’t like the food , you can at the very least pay for the drinks			2
' he added : ' i ’m very angry and worried about how this is going to affect my business			0
' my takings have been down since and one member of staff resigned after what happened			0
' i spent three years building my reputation on @entity63 - now all you can see is these complaints			0

one customer was so irate at the delays at the @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , pictured , he stormed into the kitchen and started shouting at the chef mr @entity2 lost more than £ 1,000 after 43 customers walked out without paying			1
he said : ' my takings have been down since and one member of staff resigned after what happened ' but one customer who did n’t walk out posted a review describing his experience on the night as ‘ absolutely shocking ’			2
they wrote : ' had the worst dining experience of my life			1
' the service was absolutely awful ...			0
by 10pm , having been in the restaurant for two hours , we had n’t even ordered our main courses			2
' whilst we were there , 48 people got up and walked out of the restaurant due to the horrific service - they had asked to see the manager , but the manager made no appearance , so they got fed up of waiting			2
mr @entity2 said the incident has affected trade at the @entity3 - a @entity11 restaurant and takeaway ' they had the cheek to add a service charge to the bill which we took up with the owner of the restaurant - after he had dealt with a similar issue with another table			1
' following our horrific ordeal , the owner ‘ graciously ’ waived the 10 % service charge and ‘ generously ’ gave us a whole £ 3 off our bill rounding it down to £ 50 and telling us that he had already lost £ 800 that night as if we were supposed to feel sorry for him			1
' he then stood up and turned around to the rest of the restaurant and shouted " does anyone else want to have a go , i ’m standing right here ? "			0
' the owner was rude and obnoxious and had literally zero understanding of how disgraceful the evening had been for every diner in his restaurant - treating every customer as if they were being unreasonable in their expectations			2
several pictures of dishes from the @entity3 have been posted on @entity63 including one of the @entity141 , left , and the rice - based @entity142 , right ' it is impossible to please everyone in this world , and of course there will always be the odd complaint here and there , but when an entire restaurant of people complains , and 48 walk out , you really do need to question what you are doing wrong - and not treat your customers as if they are being unjustified in their complaint			2
' the food was nice though when we eventually got it - i ’ll give them that			0
' mr @entity2 said he has been in contact with the big group but says they are refusing to pay the outstanding £ 1,128.72 bill			1
