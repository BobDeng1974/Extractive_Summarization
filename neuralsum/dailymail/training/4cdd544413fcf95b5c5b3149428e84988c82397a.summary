@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 insists he is ready to step back into the firing line after making an unexpected return to the team			1
a thigh injury to @entity6 just 15 minutes into the 1 - 0 @entity8 victory at @entity9 meant the @entity12 international 's exile was ended sooner than he could have anticipated			1
having been dropped a fortnight ago because of poor form , and missing the last three matches , his comeback was not all plain sailing			1
and , while he made one good save from @entity17 in the first half , he was far from convincing , and allowing a @entity19 backpass to go out of play before he kicked it still requires some explaining			0
@entity0 replaces the injured @entity6 ( second left ) during @entity1 's match against @entity9 @entity0 ( left ) , pictured making a save from the feet of @entity25 , kept a clean sheet on his return to action but the 26 - year - old is confident he can get back up and running quickly , as he will be in goal for the visit of @entity32 on monday with youngster @entity33 on the bench			1
' i just take every game as it comes , ' @entity0 said			1
' i work hard and keep my head down like i 've always done - nothing changes			1
' sometimes things get tough but you still have to step up and i am a positive guy and will try to go again			2
' you always have to be ready when you are on the bench			2
when you are second - choice goalkeeper , anything can happen in the warm - up , so i prepared myself as normal			2
@entity6 has his head in his hands after leaving the field with a thigh injury after just 15 minutes on @entity8 @entity0 was playing his first game back after being sidelined for three , but it was n't all plain sailing ' i was still warm from the warm - up so that helped a bit			1
i tried to stay relaxed			0
i 'm not a guy who gets flustered easily , so i tried to focus on my own game			0
' me and @entity6 get on really well			2
it is unfortunate for him to pick up an injury , but he will be back soon			0
' we focus on ourselves and do our best every day in training to get better			0
' when you get the chance you hope you do well and we got three points , so i am pleased with that because it is a difficult ground to go to and it was a difficult battle			0
' @entity0 kept only his fifth clean sheet in 23 appearances this season , but it was a crucial one with such a slender margin of victory			2
@entity71 ( right ) secured @entity1 all three points with a second - half strike at @entity74 @entity71 rounds @entity9 keeper @entity75 to slot home and put @entity1 1 - 0 up on @entity8 it secured a first win in four league matches and , with @entity32 and @entity81 both to visit @entity82 over the next week , there is a chance to build some much - needed momentum			1
' at half - time it was still 0 - 0 and in the second half we went out and did the job , ' @entity0 added after @entity71 's second - half winner			1
' we knew it was going to be tough , but we fought really hard as a team and worked well			0
' when you step onto the pitch , you have to do a job and i am pleased how we played			0
we got the three points and that is what mattered			0
' it can only be a good thing as we have a couple of fixtures we can look forward to and pick up three points			0
