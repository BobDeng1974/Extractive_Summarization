@entity15 - based @entity2 appeared at the @entity3 after @entity18 businessman @entity16 applied for her committal to prison for alleged contempt of court			1
the case , which the soprano claims ‘ nearly destroyed her life ’ , has its origins in a deal said to have been struck between miss @entity2 ’s father and mr @entity28 in 1999 , which the businessman claimed entitled him to a share of her future earnings as a singer in return for financing her music studies			1
