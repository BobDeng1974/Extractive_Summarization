bust - boosting surgery has never been more popular , with more than 11,000 boob job operations taking place in the @entity3 alone each year			1
but not everyone wants to go under the knife , including some of the a-list clients who visit @entity8 medic dr @entity7			1
instead of scalpels and implants , they are opting for a new treatment which has been dubbed ' the @entity14 boob job ' and uses injectables to plump up the cleavage			1
' it is a knifeless instantaneous breast lift			0
this form of breast augmentation works best for those who are between a cup size a and c and is safer and quicker than regular surgery			2
' the £ 1,000 treatment involves injecting @entity14 into the pectoral muscles which temporarily relaxes them , leaving the shoulder and surrounding chest muscles to take the strain			1
as a result , breasts are lifted and look higher and firmer , although given @entity14 wears off , the effect lasts for a maximum of six months			1
' there 's no downtime , no reported side effects , no scars and it is virtually painless , ' adds dr @entity7			1
' it takes less than 30 minutes and is the ideal treatment for women suffering from post-pregnancy droopy boobs , ageing , sagging breasts or a wrinkly bust line as a result of sun damage			2
popular : @entity14 is the most popular injectable in use in the @entity3 and accounts for 45,464 treatments a year risky : breast enhancement is n't without its risks as the recent @entity61 implant scandal demonstrated ' it is also good if you want a bit of extra support so you can go braless as many of my red carpet clients do			2
' traditional breast enhancement involves having a cut made either beneath the breasts or in the armpits and inserting a silicone implant between the breast tissue and the chest muscle			0
operations cost between £ 3,500 and £ 5,000 and , according to the @entity76 , complications can include infection , scarring and loss of sensation in the nipple			0
nevertheless , according to figures produced by the @entity84 [ @entity85 ] , they remain one of the most popular cosmetic surgeries			0
but thanks to scandals such as the @entity61 implant saga , which saw women fitted with enhancements made with industrial , rather than medical , grade silicone , many are turning to ' safer ' injectables such as @entity14			0
although @entity98 , a filler marketed as a ' lunchtime boob jab ' was withdrawn from sale two years ago following claims that 25 per cent of patients suffered complications after the treatment , others have proved considerably less problematic			0
among them is @entity14 , which , according to the @entity107 [ @entity107 ] , is the most popular non-surgical cosmetic treatment in the world			2
in total , say @entity107 , 45,464 @entity14 injections were carried out by qualified practitioners on @entity3 women last year .			0

the ' @entity14 boob job ' involves having @entity14 injected into pectoral muscles
relaxing effect forces the shoulder and chest muscles to take the strain
as a result , breasts look *perkier* , higher and up to a cup size larger
dr @entity7 says it is becoming *increasingly* popular with celebrities
treatment costs £ 1,000 and lasts for six months but *avoids* scarring
