relive @entity1 's coverage of the @entity2 as @entity3 travelled to @entity4 for the first leg of their play - off against @entity7			1
both teams had chances in an open game , while @entity11 hit the post late on			1
the visitors were playing the latter period of the game with ten men after @entity17 was sent off for two petulant yellow cards			1
@entity7 : @entity19 @entity3 : @entity19 host commentator final whistle goes , sorry about the lack of goals ... @entity3 probably had the best of the chances tonight , hitting the post late on , but after @entity17 's sending off will have to take a draw away from home			1
they 'll be back at the @entity29 next week , and will be eager to make the group stage			0
90mins : late sub for @entity3 , who will be happy with this scoreline now , despite that near miss. credit to @entity35 , who has been brilliant going forward , and in defence on the right			1
88mins : that was absolutely brilliant from @entity11			2
dribbling in from the right - hand side , the midfielder unleashes a shot on his weaker foot which the goalkeeper does well to tip onto the post			2
83mins : @entity3 understandably sitting back now , its @entity7 ' time to attack			1
@entity45 , formerly of @entity46 , is on for @entity47 who seemed to be losing his temper			0
80mins : well this makes things interesting ... @entity17 picked up a cheap first yellow for tugging back his opponent , and he makes the same mistake			2
tugs back @entity47 after losing possession , and now the visitors have a real challenge on their hands			0
72mins : second sub for @entity3 , as the hugely promising @entity60 goes off			1
like for like swap with the @entity62 coming on			0
68mins : finally @entity3 burst into life into the second half			1
great passing down the right between @entity60 and @entity35 , and the right - backs pull - back finds @entity68 ... but his shot is blocked			1
approaching the 70th minute , @entity70 has the likes of @entity72 , @entity11 and @entity73 available should he wish to change things up			2
66mins : @entity75 joins @entity17 and @entity76 in the book for @entity3 as he catches @entity78 late as the midfielder tried to play @entity80 through			1
59mins : neither team committing too much at the moment			0
few shots from long range here and there , but little else			0
you would think @entity7 would have to come out and attack , being the home team			1
55mins : it 's almost like his job is collecting yellows			0
@entity76 goes into the book , a flurry of sorts at the moment			0
53mins : lots of challenges going in so i 'm surprised that 's the first booking of the game			0
@entity102 cynically takes out @entity60 on the halfway line as the @entity104 broke past him			1
minutes later @entity17 pulls back @entity47 and earns himself a cheap yellow			2
50mins : worry for @entity3 with @entity107 up next , skipper @entity106 hobbles off with a knock			1
@entity76 replaces him , while @entity109 takes the captain 's armband			2
@entity3 made it into half - time for refuge but the second - half has exactly the same feel			1
@entity7 quicker and sharper to the ball , more aggressive			2
@entity3 would probably take the 0 - 0 if it were on offer at the moment			1
47mins : @entity3 carved open			2
@entity120 is played in down the left with so much space to run in to - he cuts inside , opens up the shot into the far corner , but @entity126 will be relieved to see that one curl just wide			1
no shot from kick - off this time			1
so much for entertainment , @entity3 ... well that was different , eh ? the @entity2 is back , and it was so nearly back with a bang with @entity80 's five - second shot off the bar from kick - off			1
it 's been end - to - end in @entity4 , but both teams ca n't quite execute their final ball			0
@entity60 has looked lively for the visitors , while @entity68 should really have opened the scoring			1
it has n't been @entity68 's half			1
a beautiful chipped ball finds the @entity144 but he misses his left - footed volley completely			0
44mins : rare lack of composure from @entity148			0
the youngster attempts a crossfield pass to his centre - back partner , but it 's intercepted by @entity80			2
the striker twists and turns and his shot wrong foots @entity126 , but it 's just wide			2
@entity156 have just taken a surprise lead away at @entity158 , @entity159 with that goal			0
seems to be a thriller in @entity162 too , with @entity163 leading 3 - 2			0
38mins : great effort from @entity165			2
the midfielder plays a one - two with @entity68 , and after looking up to see no one in front of him , curls towards goal from 25 yards			1
the keeper does well to dive and save and hold			0
that was heading towards the top corner			0
30mins : slight appeal for a penalty there for @entity7			2
@entity177 tracks veli and does n't get the ball , but the player was n't going for it himself			2
right decision from the referee			0
chambers so full of composure for @entity3 at the back			2
this is his first @entity2 game and he is clearly enjoying himself out there			1
everything about him is measured and controlled			0
25mins : plenty of whistles as @entity3 try and build attacks			2
@entity68 , who has been somewhat sluggish so far , nearly picks out @entity60 with a dinked cross			1
@entity3 in the ascendancy as the hosts sit back			2
18mins : this game settling down after a fast and frenetic start			0
@entity60 really does look in the mood , while @entity148 has started well at the back for @entity3			1
seems they just have to be patient			0
13mins : but this is much better from @entity3 now			2
@entity60 again involved , his cut back finds @entity205 , whose shot zips past the post from a tight angle			1
@entity3 have a holding midfielder on the bench in @entity211 and it looks like they could do with him in the early part of this game			2
@entity3 ’s midfield being over-run in the opening spell			2
12mins : seems to be so much space for @entity3 on the right			2
this time @entity17 tries to break clear but the referee does n't play advantage after a trip on @entity60			1
10mins : great ball from @entity47 over the top of @entity148 to find @entity80			0
the @entity225 striker connects well with his left foot on the volley , but the goalkeeper does well to palm it away			0
looking really dangerous here , the hosts			0
but here 's @entity3 on the break ! @entity60 bursts clear but his cross is deflected and @entity68 ca n't quite get it out of his feet			1
5mins : all over the place at the minute @entity3			0
the hosts are playing nice quick football on this ' questionable ' surface			0
@entity70 's side struggling to get going			0
away we go ! and off the bar immediately ! a shot straight from kick - off troubles @entity126			1
what a start ... @entity80 with the effort			0
and the atmosphere is incredible in @entity4			0
@entity3 will surely be happy enough with a draw here			0
can they start on the front foot ? speaking to @entity251 before the game : ' it 's windy and pitch is not the best at all , we will have to adapt			0
' @entity3 fans will hope they do that quickly ... worryingly also , he says @entity109 declared himself fit : ' @entity109 has inflamation but he has declared himself fit , you have to trust the player			1
' we know what @entity3 can bring , but what about @entity7 ? one player to look out for is @entity47 who is a former youth product in @entity266			1
@entity70 said : ' i always thought he could make a career but at our club he had big competition in front of him and that is why we let him go			0
' it is good to see he has made it to the top level and is now an important player in @entity277			0
' @entity3 have won all 12 of their previous @entity2 play - off matches			1
they have also scored eight goals in their last two games in @entity4 , against @entity282 and @entity283			0
it may be tough tonight though at the @entity285			0
perhaps they should ask @entity286 for some advice ... @entity80 has spoken this week about how @entity288 stopped his move to @entity3 last summer , and he now believes he did n't play for @entity290 as he was n't a star name			1
‘ sometimes when you are at a club with a lot of big stars , the name counts for more than the statistics			0
unfortunately , it was like that in my case , ’ he said			0
time to prove your point ! as expected @entity80 starts for the hosts , looking to build on his two goals in five games against the @entity305			1
for @entity3 , @entity68 comes in for the injured @entity306 , and similarly @entity75 replaces @entity307			1
@entity60 will be looking to score his first goal for the club , and do n't forget about @entity17 ... @entity126 ; @entity35 , @entity109 , @entity177 , @entity75 ; @entity106 , @entity17 ; @entity205 , @entity165 , @entity60 ; @entity68			1

@entity148 is expected to make his @entity2 debut after impressing in recent weeks , while it will be interesting to see whether @entity60 starts			1
the @entity104 struggled somewhat in the 2 - 1 victory against @entity327 at the weekend , and could be rested for this weekend 's trip to @entity107			0
hit them where it hurts ! @entity331 may not be here ( though there is still @entity126 ) , but @entity7 manager @entity334 says his side will be battling on the pitch ... not taking pictures			1
' we are not here to take selfies with @entity3 on the pitch , we are here to battle to the end , ' @entity334 said at his pre-match press conference			0
