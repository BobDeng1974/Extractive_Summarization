by @entity0 published : 07:21 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 09:55 est , 25 june 2013 @entity1 is not obliged to delete personal information from its search results , an adviser to the @entity6 court of justice has decided			2
in a defeat for the so - called ' right to be forgotten ' privacy principle under debate in @entity6 , an adviser to the highest @entity13 court backed the internet search giant 's position that it can not erase legal content from the internet even if it is harmful to an individual			1
but he rejected the view of many @entity22 internet firms that they are not bound by @entity13 privacy law			1
ruling : the @entity25 has said that @entity1 and other search engines are not responsible when personal information appears on web pages they index ' requesting search engine service providers to suppress legitimate and legal information that has entered the public domain would entail an interference with the freedom of expression , ' the @entity32 - based court said in a statement setting out advocate general @entity41 's opinion			1
while internet - based firms operating in the @entity13 must adhere to national data protection laws , that did not oblige them to remove personal content produced by third parties , the statement said			2
' search engine service providers are not responsible , on the basis of the ( @entity13 's ) @entity50 , for personal data appearing on web pages they process			2
' lawyers agree that @entity1 's search algorithms , which hunt and list weblinks based on how relevant they may be , would not be in a position to ' know ' whether data was personal or not			0
' a search engine is just a tool , ' said @entity62 , a @entity63 - based lawyer from @entity64			0
' the nature of that information is irrelevant			0
it is just ones and zeros			0
' a final judgment on the case is expected before the end of the year			1
judges in the @entity25 are not bound by an advocate general 's opinion , but follow such recommendations in the majority of cases			1
backed : an adviser to the highest @entity13 court backed the internet search giant 's position that it can not erase legal content from the internet even if it is harmful to an individual the case stems from a complaint by a @entity90 man that a public notice announcing that his home was up for auction after being repossessed infringed his privacy and should be deleted from @entity1 's search results			1
his case is one of 180 similar examples in @entity90 in which people have sought to have content deleted from @entity1 searches			0
the other cases are on hold pending the @entity13 court 's decision			1
the original auction announcement was from a @entity90 newspaper , which said it was under a legal obligation to publish the notice			0
@entity1 welcomed the advocate general 's opinion , saying it supported the company 's view that deleting such content amounted to censorship			2
' this is a good opinion for free expression , ' said @entity118 , @entity1 's head of free expression in @entity6 , the @entity120 and @entity121 , in an emailed statement			0
but @entity124 companies may be disappointed at the opinion that they should follow @entity13 privacy law even if the data is handled outside the @entity13			1
many internet firms maintain that handling data outside the 27 - member bloc means they are not subject to @entity13 privacy law			1
the advocate general said that even the presence of an advertisings business , which is fundamental to the model of companies such as @entity1 and which targets people in @entity90 , means they must follow @entity13 law			0
if that view is upheld by the @entity25 , it could put search firms under more pressure to protect the data of privacy - hungry @entity6			2
the @entity13 is finalising a major overhaul of its 20 - year - old data protection law that would make internet companies follow @entity13 rules if their services target @entity6 consumers			1
the overhaul is part of a push for increased data privacy in @entity6 , which has gained urgency after revelation of a large - scale @entity22 internet spying programme targeted at foreigners			1
@entity1 also faces fines in both @entity90 and @entity162 if it does not change its privacy policy , which allows it to collect and combine personal data across its services such as email and @entity167			0
privacy watchdogs in several other countries are also assessing @entity1 's services under their national rules			0
the @entity13 overhaul is also intended to give citizens ' a right to be forgotten ' even though it is not yet clear in what circumstances that right could be invoked			0
the advocate general said such a right does not exist in current legislation .			0
