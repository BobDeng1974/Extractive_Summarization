a chorus of naysayers is emerging with predictions that president @entity4 's plan to ' degrade and destroy ' the @entity6 terror group will fail unless he abandons his pledge that avoid a ground war in @entity9 and @entity10			1
rep. @entity11 , the @entity12 chairman of the @entity13 , said thursday that ' there is no way around it			1
' ' @entity18 boots will be standing on sand , ' he told an audience at the @entity21			2
' @entity18 will be shot at , and they will be shooting back			0
there is simply no other way to do this			0
' @entity4 has already sent more than 1,600 military personnel into @entity9 , but the @entity26 and @entity27 refer to them as ' advisers ' and ' security forces , ' not soldiers			2
' he president said during a prime - time speech wednesday night			2
' we will not get dragged into another ground war in @entity9			0
but they are needed to support @entity9 and @entity46 forces with training , intelligence and equipment			0
' as the numbers of airstrikes and boots on the ground continue to rise , experts are wondering whether ' mission creep ' will force @entity4 – sooner rather than later – to repeat the strategies of president @entity57 , which he forcefully campaigned against in 2007			1
@entity11 acknowledged that ' it is dangerous any time we have our sons and daughters take to the skies , the seas , or the shores to defeat an enemy			1
' but ' the only thing more dangerous is waiting			0
' he told the @entity70 on monday that the president should ' err on the side of more [ troops ] rather than less			1
' but he said successfully beating back @entity6 would n't require tens of thousands of armed @entity18 combatants			1
' this will take troops , ' he said thursday			0
' it will not take divisions			0
' an army division consists of between 10,000 and 20,000 soldiers			0
the @entity82 reported wednesday that @entity4 's leading generals presented him with a plan this week that called for @entity18 troops going into ground combat			1
@entity18 @entity88 commander gen. @entity87 advised the @entity26 to ' send a modest contingent of @entity18 troops , principally special operations forces , to advise and assist @entity9 army units in fighting the militants , ' the @entity82 reported , citing two unnamed military officials			1
the word ' assist ' is key			0
that would have involved embedding @entity18 soldiers with @entity9 government troops as they engaged @entity6 and took fire			1
@entity4 ultimately decided to send 475 servicemen and women to @entity9 , solely as advisers for training , intelligence and equipment			2
writing under a pen name , a @entity27 official told @entity108 on thursday that ' in both @entity9 and @entity10 , the @entity18 lacks a reliable , legitimate ground force that it can support with air strikes in order to defeat the @entity112			1
' @entity4 's plan for airstrikes combined with support for @entity9 forces and the @entity117 , the official said , ' is a foolish strategy that is unlikely to succeed			1
' @entity6 , short for the self - declared @entity6 , has mounted a fearsome campaign of terror and mass - murder across about half of the combined territories of @entity9 and @entity10			2
the group aims to establish a global caliphate that would enforce a hard - line variation of @entity127 called @entity129 law			0
it has already threatened to mount direct attacks in @entity18 cities			0
retired gen. @entity133 , who led the @entity9 ' surge ' of @entity18 troops in 2007 , cautioned on thursday that the @entity18 should n't ' overestimate ' the strength of the terror group 's standing army			1
' @entity6 in @entity9 should not be overestimated , ' he said in @entity139 during a speech about the 9/11 commemoration			2
' this , in many respects , is a – it has nowhere near the roots , the numbers , and the structure that @entity147 in @entity9 and the associated @entity149 insurgents had ' before the surge , he said			0
cancer spreads : @entity6 controls or is in the process of controlling wide swaths of territory across @entity10 and @entity9 public enemy # 1 : @entity157 , the leader of @entity6 but the @entity18 @entity158 now estimates that @entity6 may have as many as 31,000 fighters at its disposal			1
@entity6 ' can muster between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters across @entity9 and @entity10 , based on a new review of all - source intelligence reports from may to august , ' @entity158 spokesman @entity161 said in a statement			1
the group 's @entity10 contingent includes 15,000 foreign fighters – including 2,000 from @entity170 nations			0
those numbers are making some experts doubt that it can be defeated by airstrikes alone			0
@entity175 , a former @entity158 analyst and @entity177 counter-terrorism official , told the @entity178 that avoiding a ground game made @entity4 's strategy ' a waste of time			1
' @entity6 ' is an army , ' he said			2
' the air power is not going to get the job done			0
until you put troops in and kill these guys , they 're going to continue			0
' an unnamed @entity191 officer echoed @entity11 's caution that a mid-sized contingent could get the job done			2
' air power alone can not win wars , ' the officer told the @entity178			0
' [ @entity4 's ] stated strategy ignores this widely accepted truth			1
but with troops on the ground , in very small numbers , we can team with @entity46 and @entity203 to support those ground forces in rapidly defeating @entity6			1
' retired army general @entity205 added that defeating the terror group ' requires a ground counteroffensive to retake lost territory			2
' his preference , however , would be to continue the current effort ' led by the @entity9 army and the @entity117 [ and ] supported by close air support			0

leading *congressman* calls on @entity4 to put ' boots on the ground ' in the @entity88 to stop the spread of @entity6
' there is simply no other way to do this , ' rep. @entity11 said
other experts argue that @entity4 's targeted airstrikes wo n't be *sufficient* to defeat what has become an @entity227 army of 31,000 fighters
one former @entity158 analyst called the president 's strategy ' a waste of time '
sources told the @entity82 that @entity4 *overruled* his generals ' request to put ground troops in harm 's way
but retired gen. @entity133 said @entity6 is weak *compared* to the @entity147 of old , and should n't be overestimated
