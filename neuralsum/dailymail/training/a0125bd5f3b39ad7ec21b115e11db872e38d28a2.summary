a talented young opera singer left without a penny of his father 's £ 2 million fortune has won a court payout to fund his music career - as long as he gets into a prestigious college			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , was just 17 when his father , @entity10 businessman , @entity9 , died aged 56 in 2006 , making ' no provision ' for him in his will			1
mr @entity9 left £ 350,000 to charity and put the rest of his money into a trust fund from which his illegitimate son was specifically ' excluded '			1
opera singer @entity7 , 25 , was left without a penny of his father 's fortune but will win a payout to fund his career - as long as he gets into the @entity23 ( pictured ) , or the @entity24 but now a high court judge has effectively overruled mr @entity9 and ordered that should mr @entity7 be accepted into either the @entity23 , or the @entity24 , his father 's estate must foot part of the bill			1
the teenager excelled in music at @entity32 and went on to study at the @entity33 and the @entity34 in @entity35			0
he has now applied to the elite @entity37 institutions as part of his post-graduate studies			0
the executors of mr @entity9 's estate had bitterly opposed the singer receiving any of the money			1
they even argued that mr @entity7 , now 25 , ' did not have the musical talent ' to succeed and that he was ' irresponsible with money ' , the court heard			0
however , judge @entity47 rejected both those suggestions , describing mr @entity7 as a ' keen , talented and committed ' singer with good prospects			2
his mother , @entity51 , told the court he had been passionate about singing since the age of 10 and thirsted for success on the opera stage			0
judge @entity47 , sitting at the @entity56 , rejected suggestions that mr @entity7 ' did not have the musical talent ; to succeed , describing him as a ' keen , talented and committed ' singer with good prospects he had ' specific learning difficulties ' but even a 2008 road accident - in which he suffered severe chest and internal injuries - had not held him back from achieving his ambition			1
despite being cut off by his father , mr @entity7 sought ' reasonable provision ' from his estate as a dependent			2
the executors pointed out that the estate had already paid more than £ 110,000 towards his maintenance and education costs			0
however , judge @entity47 ruled it was only right that mr @entity7 's post-graduate studies should be posthumously funded by his father			2
he was granted £ 6,500 from the estate to cover his student costs in 2015 and another £ 15,000 for the next two years			1
however , the judge said he would only get the £ 15,000 if accepted onto a post-graduate course			0
that , the court heard , will depend on how well mr @entity7 does in auditions due at the end of this month			0
according to online records , mr @entity9 was born in 1949 and was a director of @entity85 and @entity86 .			0

@entity7 , 25 , was 17 when businessman father @entity9 died

@entity92 had *battled* to stop *aspiring* singer from receiving any of the fortune

he will get another £ 15,000 - as long as he gets into elite music college
