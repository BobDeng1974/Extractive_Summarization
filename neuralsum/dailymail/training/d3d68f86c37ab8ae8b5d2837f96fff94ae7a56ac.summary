by @entity0 correspondent published : 20:24 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 20:32 est , 2 march 2014 when pictures of her weight loss made headlines last week , the @entity2 put it down to regular mountain - running sessions with her personal trainer			1
but sources close to prince @entity12 ’s ex-wife say there is another , rather more unusual , reason for her slimline figure – jam roly - poly flavoured tea			1
the diet drink was created for her after @entity20 decided to embark on a health and fitness regime			2
contrast : @entity2 ( pictured , left , last week and , right , in 2010 ) has hit the headlines after losing weight unusual : @entity25 of @entity26 put her weight loss down to regular mountain - running sessions with her personal trainer			1
but sources say there is another reason for her slimline figure - jam roly - poly flavoured tea she went to a bootcamp in the @entity36 and over 12 weeks lost more than two stone through daily mountain runs and hikes with her trainer , @entity41 , and eating a calorie - controlled diet			1
but , said a friend , 54 - year - old @entity20 still struggled with her sweet tooth			2
in desperation , she went to a master tea maker and asked them to create a range of flavoured hot diet drinks she could have instead of reaching for the biscuit tin			1
together they came up with a range of 17 teas in three categories			0
the first is based on @entity56 puddings and includes jam roly - poly , rhubarb fool , strawberries and cream , bakewell tart , chocolate torte , and mint humbug			1
hair scraped back : @entity25 of @entity26 looked tired and drawn as she left a restaurant in @entity66 last week the second is a variety of ‘ mocktail ’ teas including pink champagne , gin and tonic , whisky and ginger , and pina colada			0
the third is a take on classics including @entity80 and @entity81			0
the teas helped her lose another stone – making three stone in all – and @entity20 is said to be delighted , even though critics have described her as looking tired and drawn			0
now the once cash - strapped duchess is looking at bringing out her own personal range of pudding - flavoured diet teas			0
different tactics : @entity20 lost more than two stone over 12 weeks during a bootcamp in the @entity36 alps with her trainer , @entity41 ( left )			2
but , said a friend , the 54 - year - old still struggled with her sweet tooth			2
so the @entity2 went to a tea maker who created a range of diet drinks , including one tasting of mint humbugs ( right ) @entity105 the friend said : ‘ at the moment the teas are just for her but she has had so much interest in them that she is considering whether to market them			1
' there are a number of commercial opportunities she is exploring but nothing has been signed yet			0
’ @entity20 ’s weight has yo - yoed over the years and the friend added : ‘ like most women she just wants to feel better about herself			0
‘ but she is also very keen to work on the global plan to combat obesity and wanted to put her money where her mouth was , so to speak			0
