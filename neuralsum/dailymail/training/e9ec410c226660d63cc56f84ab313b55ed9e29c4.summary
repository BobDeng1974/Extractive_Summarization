scientists have found a way to predict whether convicted criminals are likely to re-offend by looking at their brain neuroscientists claim to have found a way to predict whether convicted criminals are likely to re-offend by looking at their brain scans according to @entity14 imaging experts , convicts showing low activity in an area of the brain associated with decision - making and action are more likely to be arrested again			1
a team led by @entity16 , a neuroscientist at the @entity17 in @entity18 , studied a group of 96 male prisoners shortly before they were due to be released			2
they scanned prisoners brains while they were carrying out computer tasks in which subjects had to make quick decisions and inhibit impulsive reactions			0
the researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity29 ) to focus on activity in a section of the anterior cingulate cortex ( @entity33 ) - a small region in the front of the brain involved in motor control and executive functioning			1
they then followed the subjects for four years			0
among the ex-criminals studied , those who had lower @entity33 activity during the quick - decision tasks were more likely to be arrested again after getting out of prison			1
this was even after the researchers accounted for other risk factors such as age , drug and alcohol abuse and psychopathic traits , @entity45 reports			0
according to @entity14 brain imaging experts , convicts showing low activity in an area of the brain associated with decision - making and action are more likely to be arrested again men who were in the lower half of the @entity33 activity ranking had a 2.6-fold higher rate of rearrest for all crimes and a 4.3-fold higher rate for nonviolent crimes			1
the results are published in the proceedings of the @entity70 of @entity71			0
@entity16 admits that more work is needed to prove the technique and added that low @entity33 activity could have a variety of causes — impulsivity , caffeine use , vascular health , low motivation or better neural efficiency — and not all of these are related to criminal behaviour .			2

experts scanned anterior cingulate cortex ( @entity33 ) in 96 prisoners
the area is associated with decision - making and action
in convicts the area showed ' low activity ' in executive functioning *skills*
