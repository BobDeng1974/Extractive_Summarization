by @entity0 figures show that where nearly 8 per cent of households in @entity3 who are meant to pay , wriggle out of it council tax bills could be cut by an average £ 100 per household if authorities chased up debts properly			1
slack enforcement of council tax debts is costing households and local authorities , creating large disparities between areas with similar family incomes			1
some £ 604 million of council tax , or 2.6 per cent , went uncollected in @entity20 last year			1
if councils were to recover the £ 604 million , it would be enough to meet all the staffing costs of public libraries , cover the cost of @entity27 childcare for nearly half a million children and pay for two - thirds of the government 's free school meals for infants			2
councils have complained that cuts in funding from central government will force them to either raise council tax bills or slash services			1
but the varying disparity in collection rates will raise questions over the validity of their complaints			0
the worst collection rate in the country is in @entity3 , where nearly 8 per cent of households who are meant to pay , wriggle out of it			1
its enforcement rate of 92.1 per cent lags behind the @entity51 's 99.5 per cent			0
the average for @entity20 councils is 97.4 per cent			0
if @entity3 were to reach this national average , the bill for a house in @entity56 of council tax ( valued at £ 120,000 to £ 160,00 ) could come down by nearly £ 123			1
analysis by the @entity60 ( @entity61 ) compared council tax enforcement for areas with similar profiles in 2012/13			2
@entity65 only managed to collect 92.9 per cent of the council tax owed , while @entity66 achieved 97.1 per cent			1
experts said if @entity69 achieved a similar rate as @entity66 , council tax could be slashed by 4.2 per cent and still yield the same total for the local authority			2
this would reduce the bill for a band f property by £ 86.36			0
@entity77 also collected just 93.5 per cent , compared to @entity78 's more impressive 98 per cent			0
if @entity79 could achieve the same collection rate , council tax could be slashed by 4.5 per cent and still rake in the same for the town hall			1
this would reduce the bill for a band e property by £ 94.05			0
analysis by the @entity60 ( @entity61 ) compared council tax enforcement for areas with similar profiles in 2012/13 @entity89 , director general of @entity61 said : ' these figures show that those local authorities that take a more proactive approach to the enforcement of council tax are helping to ease the financial burden on taxpayers and protecting revenue for vital public services on which vulnerable people depend			1
' he added : ' in an economic climate where @entity104 bills are set to rise by 0.6 per cent on average across local authorities in @entity20 , and by 4.6 per cent in @entity106 , this proportion of uncollected tax , upwards of £ 600m , represents a missed opportunity			0
' bailiffs have also said the reasons that debtors are giving for not paying their council tax are getting increasingly absurd			2
one debtor told a bailiff that they could not make their monthly instalment as they had to pay for a funeral of a cat			0
another said his fish tank broke , flooding his living room so he had to replace the tank and fish			0
bailiffs heard that one man tried to avoid paying council tax as he had to put the money towards a stag party instead			1
another enforcement officer greeted a supposedly broke debtor who had returned from her three week holiday in @entity134			0
she complained he had ruined her holiday by turning up			0
mr @entity89 said : ' these excuses can be quite astonishing but they mask a real problem in that those who avoid their council tax when they can afford to pay it are increasing the costs for everyone else			2

£ *600million* of council tax was not collected last year , figures show
if town halls raked in the money it would pay for more services
in @entity3 alone 8 *%* of households did not pay what they owed
