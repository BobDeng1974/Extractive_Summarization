but more than a year on and @entity7 has not been traced , despite an international arrest warrant being issued			1
@entity14 was convicted of raping a 12 - year - old girl in his absence and sentenced to 11 years ' jail now the girl 's mother has revealed that her determined daughter plans to hire a private detective to track down @entity7 because of the apparent lack of progress in the case by @entity24			1
the victim , now 15 , plans to fund the hunt from money due to be awarded to her by the @entity29			1
her mother said : ' we do not know if police have any leads , any sightings , or even if they have spoken lately to police in @entity8 , where we believe he is probably living			2
for my daughter , her life is in limbo			2
' she can not move on while the man who abused her is walking free			2
' she is due to receive money ... early next year			1
she plans to use some of that to hire a private detective to see if they can trace her rapist			1

he fled abroad shortly before his trial last may			1
the mother said : ' the police investigation from the very beginning seemed slow and it has all been such a long , drawn out process			0

inquiries are ongoing and @entity52 officers are in continuous contact with foreign authorities via the @entity104 and @entity105			0
' while we are making inquiries to locate @entity7 we do not have jurisdiction , or power in law , to go to another country until their law enforcement officers have detained the wanted individual			0
our officers have supplied the relevant authorities with a significant amount of information and our work with them is ongoing			0
' the police also insisted the family were ' happy ' at the updates they are receiving from the force			0
' after hearing of the victim 's family 's initial dissatisfaction at lack of contact after the court date we agreed a communication method with a single point of contact and remain committed to updating them with any investigative developments			2
they understand and are happy that this will only be when there is significant news			0
' but the mother said : ' the police family liaison officers have been wonderful , but there is only so much they can tell us			0
' since de @entity7 's conviction we have had very little feedback from police about their search for him and have heard nothing substantial about the investigation for months			0
we have been left in the dark			0
