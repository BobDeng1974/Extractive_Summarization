by @entity0 one of the few remaining @entity2 survivors of a @entity4 prisoner of war camp immortalised in @entity6 film has died aged 91			1
@entity8 gunner @entity7 , of @entity9 , @entity10 , was taken to @entity11 in @entity12 as a teenager during the @entity14 after his bomber crashed in @entity16 in 1940			1
he was in hut 104 , home to 76 airmen who tried to escape via a 348ft tunnel in 1944			1
but the alarm was raised before mr @entity7 , who had helped dispose of soil from the tunnel , could join them			1
mr @entity7 - finally freed towards the end of the war - returned in 2009 to the camp in @entity43 , which was originally @entity4 territory and held about 10,000 @entity8 crew at the height of its occupation			1
the escape from the camp was the single greatest freedom attempt by @entity51 in the war			0
among the 50 who were shot was @entity54 , the mastermind of the plot which hoped to free over 200 men			1
some 26 of the 76 who tried to escape were returned to the camp while three made ‘ home runs ’ to @entity2			1
all 29 have since died			0
mr @entity7 helped the escape committee draw up the tunnel plans			1
digging for victory : @entity7 is pictured second right at @entity11 in @entity12 , where he was taken as a teenager during the @entity14 after his bomber crashed in @entity16 in 1940 the original plan was for three tunnels , codenamed @entity67			1
but @entity67 was discovered soon after it was started , and it was decided to use @entity70 to store the spoil from @entity31 as it was dug			0
' the tension was electric the night of the escape			0
and then around dawn i heard a shot and barking and i knew it was all over ' @entity7 ' i was given a chance to go on the escape but the priority was given to those men who had the best chance - @entity4 speakers and the like			1
it was a lottery and my number did n’t come up , ' mr @entity7 said in an interview in 2011			2
' the tension was electric the night of the escape			0
and then around dawn i heard a shot and barking and i knew it was all over			0
' he said the character of @entity97 in the film - the @entity95 played by @entity99 who was machine - gunned by the watchtower guards - was based on his real - life friend @entity101			0
also there at the visit in march 2009 was @entity104 , 95 , who was married one month before he was shot down in october 1939 , and remained a prisoner of the @entity4 until may 1945			2
historic visit : @entity2 veterans ( from left to right ) @entity108 , @entity104 , @entity7 ( circled ) and @entity109 returned to the @entity11 camp in @entity43 in march 2009 - 64 years after the war ended mr @entity7 ’s widow , @entity112 , 69 , said : ‘ he gave lots of talks about the escape and always said he was doing it in memory of those 50			1
' @entity7 could never understand why people where so interested in him , but they were ' @entity121 , his widow ‘ @entity7 could never understand why people where so interested in him , but they were			2
we often had to put extra talks on so more people could come			0
’ in 1947 , 18 soldiers who shot those who were recaptured , were put before the @entity128 in @entity129			0
thirteen of them were executed , with the rest receiving long prison sentences			0
the story of the escape was made into a film in 1963 , starring actors @entity137 , @entity139 and @entity140			1
decades later , the 2000 film @entity142 was based on the movie			0
on a later visit in 2011 , the efforts of the airmen who inspired the film were recreated by a historian			2
lighting a candle : mr @entity7 - finally freed towards the end of the war - returned in 2009 to the camp in @entity43 , which was originally @entity4 territory and held about 10,000 @entity8 crew at the height of its occupation the tunnel used by @entity51 for their escape - made from 4,000 bed boards and dug with thousands of pieces of cutlery - was rebuilt using the same makeshift tools and materials used by the inmates			1
other materials used by the prisoners included 90 double bunk beds , 635 mattresses , 3,424 towels - and also about 1,400 milk cans to create an ingenious ventilation system			0
the @entity51 should not have succeeded in their escape because the camp was deliberately built on a type of sandy soil that was meant to make it impossible for them to build such a tunnel			2
@entity180 historian dr @entity179 went back to the site to build a 33ft imitation along with a team of experts , archaeologists , veterans and modern - day @entity8 personnel			2
mr @entity7 then demonstrated using a trolley at the entrance to the escape tunnel ’s recreation , which was documented in @entity35 programme digging the @entity6 in november 2011			1
the airman , who died on tuesday in a @entity9 nursing home , was born in the village of @entity196 , near @entity197 , and volunteered to join the @entity8 when was 18			1
keeping fit : mr @entity7 , second left , plays football with airmen at the @entity12 camp during the @entity14 he was posted to @entity202 at @entity203 under the command of @entity206 hero @entity205 , who asked him to volunteer for the mission when his @entity209 bomber was shot down			1
mrs @entity121 said : ‘ @entity7 was an orderly to the engineer who drew up the escape plans so he had full knowledge of what was going on			1
‘ it was decided the first 50 to escape would be the ones who had the best chance of reaching freedom , those who could speak @entity4 or had some knowledge of @entity4			2
‘ @entity7 's name went into the hat for the order of escape			2
a total of 200 were to go out first followed by a second 200 the following night			0
@entity7 was no 215 so he never got a chance			2
’ mr @entity7 , who was promoted to warrant officer while in the camp , survived the ' @entity229 ' which claimed 300 lives when the @entity4 evacuated prisoners with the @entity232 approaching			0
he was later finally freed and returned home			0
the couple , who have a daughter and three grandchildren , married in 1969			0
@entity6 : the story of the escape was made into a film in 1963 , starring actor @entity137 mr @entity7 carved out a career as a civil servant , retiring when he was 62			1

he was playing golf and gardening just a few weeks before his death			0
mrs @entity121 added : ‘ he gave talks wherever and whenever people wanted him and it was an emotional time for him when returned to @entity4 to the site of the camp			0
‘ he saw @entity6 and always used to say what was shown on the camp in the film was the truth but everything filmed outside the camp was pure @entity257			2
‘ but he said if the film had never been made then no one would ever have heard the story of the great escape and it was a story that should never be forgotten			1
