by @entity1 reporter from the beauteous @entity3 to the lovely @entity4 , @entity2 has no shortage of beautiful @entity6 - and they know it			1
despite the presence of the equally gorgeous @entity11 and @entity12 on the @entity14 benches , an @entity9 newspaper has claimed victory in the battle of the @entity6			1
in an article bizarrely headlined ' wags absent – @entity21 triumphs in the battle of the wives ' , @entity19 claimed that @entity9 is best when it comes to women			0
chief among the @entity9 wags is @entity28 ’s fiancee @entity3 , who became engaged to the @entity9 striker last week			1
@entity38 ’s wife @entity44 , a former @entity9 tennis player , will attend with their children , and former @entity47 player @entity39 ’s partner @entity4 , who is pregnant with their second child , will also be on hand			2
other famous wags in the @entity2 camp include @entity53 's glamorous girlfriend @entity52 and @entity55 's elegant wife @entity54			2
but while there 's no shortage of stunning @entity6 supporting @entity21 from the sidelines , it is n't all plain sailing for @entity2 's players - two of whom are currently dealing with break - ups			1
glamorous : @entity64 's @entity63 ( left ) and @entity66 's spouse , @entity67 stunning : @entity63 is currently pregnant with her second child with husband @entity39 the boss : @entity70 , the wife of @entity21 coach @entity40 waves to the crowd during a game marital bliss : @entity75 with his wife @entity77 ( left ) and @entity78 and @entity12 ( right ) stylish : @entity80 's @entity79 is more stylish than he is , while @entity81 also wins in the style stakes one is injured goalkeeper @entity83 who is currently in the throes of a divorce from his wife , the @entity87 supermodel @entity86			1
equally miserable is playmaker @entity88 who was forced to seek solace with the @entity2 squad priest , @entity90 , after being dumped by his wife @entity91 , following an alleged liaison with blonde @entity93 , who he met at his golf club			0
by contrast , the @entity14 camp is a relative oasis of marital harmony with one member of the team , @entity78 , set to marry his long term love @entity12 as soon as the @entity103 ends			0
equally happy are the @entity104 , who recently celebrated their sixth wedding anniversary , and the @entity106			0
but while many of the @entity9 wags will be spotted in the stands , none of the @entity14 team is thought to have brought their partners to @entity113 , although @entity81 is on her way			2
@entity75 ’s wife @entity77 is currently on holiday in @entity117 , although may travel out to @entity113 should @entity14 make it through the group stages			0
