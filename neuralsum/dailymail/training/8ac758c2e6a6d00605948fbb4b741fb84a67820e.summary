@entity1 flanker @entity0 has revealed @entity3 ’s men will seek to exploit any ‘ chinks in the armour ’ of @entity6 in their @entity8 opener next week			1
@entity6 hooker @entity9 , whose ill - discipline has led to career suspensions totalling 50 weeks , has been warned by forwards coach @entity12 that he can expect intense goading in @entity14			1
@entity0 conceded that ‘ chatting ’ with opponents is part and parcel of the game			0
@entity0 warn @entity6 they will face a huge battle in the @entity8 opener @entity0 poses with the @entity8 trophy after @entity1 beat @entity22 in 2012 ‘ some players are more vocal than others , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ in your own team you have leaders who do the main chatting in a game			0
you look for chinks in the armour			0
’ @entity3 believes the decision to sacrifice rugby training for fitness drills helped @entity1 overcome their southern hemisphere demons during the autumn internationals			1
a 12 - 6 victory over @entity38 ended a run of 22 consecutive defeats to the ‘ big three ’ and @entity3 believes adopting a pre-season style fitness programme before the four - test series paid dividends			2
early preparations were based around 6.30am bike training followed by sessions in the cryotheraphy chamber , as the coaches focused on narrowing the speed deficit between the northern and southern hemisphere			2
@entity3 will pend more time working on the skills of his @entity1 squad for the @entity8 ‘ we flipped it over for the last two weeks , ’ @entity3 told @entity55			1
‘ for @entity57 and @entity38 , we did a lot of rugby			0
against the @entity57 we were winning after 69 minutes and in the past they beat us by playing rugby			0
but we coped with that and i remember thinking “ we ’ve never been in this situation before ”			0
’ @entity64 data shows the rugby played by the @entity67 regions is much slower than the @entity69 competition in the southern hemisphere			0
a @entity67 regional player covers 55 metres per minute on average while in @entity69 it ’s 90 metres per minute			0
consequently , @entity1 spent minimal time working on skills during the first half of their november camp			2
however , @entity3 is unlikely to take the same approach preparing for the @entity6 game			1
‘ the @entity8 is different , ’ said the @entity1 coach .			1
