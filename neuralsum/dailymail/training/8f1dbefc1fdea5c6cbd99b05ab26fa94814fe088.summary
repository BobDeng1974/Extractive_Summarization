by @entity0 a group of amateur gardeners has been told they must tear up a green space they created from an old fly - tipping spot and cover it in gravel			1
the local people , who live near @entity8 in @entity9 , north @entity10 , lovingly transformed a spot which had for years hosted an accumulation of rotting , rat - infested waste			1
in its place they created a garden which boasts more than 40 different species of plants and flowers			0
urban bliss : the group of gardeners made this space out of a rubbish tip in @entity9 , north @entity10 diverse : the green space , off @entity8 , is home to more than 40 different types of plants and flowers but the group has been told by @entity30 that it is ' trespassing ' on public land , and has been told to tear up their lawn and flowerbeds or face a hefty bill			1
the council has said that if they do not return the area to its original function , of being a ' service road ' for nearby shops , they will have to pay £ 4,600 for the work to be carried out on their behalf			1
@entity45 , one of the gardeners , said the council is being ' aggressive and heavy - handed ' and that he ' could n't understand ' its actions			1
mr @entity45 , from @entity9 , said : ' this is a space that the community has turned from rubble and trash into a lovely looking garden			2

before : this photograph shows the ugly state in which the area used to exist , when it was covered in rubbish and infested by rats ' it 's a common problem and the council should see this as the embodiment of their supposed eagerness to see more greenery in the borough			2
' but instead the council seem intent on kicking us			2
' in response to the challenge from the council , the group launched a campaign to preserve the space , called @entity77			0
they were initially given a deadline of 3 december to destroy the garden , but after collecting 1,000 signatures the council suspended their deadline , and they are now left in limbo			0
in a statement released by @entity30 , @entity84 , a local councillor , said : ‘ the group have not sought permission , and as such it is an unauthorised use of a service road			0
we have therefore had to act to restore the road back to its intended use			0
‘ the council is happy to consider requests for worthwhile use on small sites owned by the taxpayer , and have done so before but we ca n't gift land to people without due regard for what its purpose is in the first place			0
