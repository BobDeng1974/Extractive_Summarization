by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 i have just returned from @entity3 but not before i witnessed the dejection of a nation almost in mourning after @entity7 broke a bone in his back			1
i ’ve heard some stupid things in my time , but for people to blame the referee for that injury is utter nonsense			2
it was n’t an under 11s game – these are grown men			2
and one professional footballer decided to stick his knee into the back of another pro at full force for no real reason			0
i ’ve heard ex-pros talk about the referee giving a team ' a free one			0
' this is where a bad foul is committed by a player from @entity72 on a player from @entity74 , but the referee does n’t give a yellow card when perhaps he should			0
not to blame : referee @entity77 did not have a great game but did not break @entity7 's back @entity74 then think they have ‘ a free one			1
’ in other words they think they can commit virtually any foul they like and they will also get away with it			0
how old are these players ? ten ? playground logic			0
any chance they could get on with playing football instead of trying to work out if they can get away with kicking and injuring their opponents ? fouls will happen , and sometimes it will be a tactic to commit fouls on certain players to stop their flow and that ’s how @entity3 decided to deal with the threat of @entity50			0
but none of the fouls on the @entity104 were even close to causing him the kind of horrific injury that @entity7 has suffered			1
crying shame : @entity7 sent an emotional message to the @entity62 public after his injury job to do : @entity114 's side train ahead of their semi-final showdown with @entity117 @entity45 to shine in @entity7 's absence - @entity118 blaming the referee is an easy way for professional footballers to wash their hands of the crimes of their colleagues			1
the referee for @entity3 ’s victory over @entity48 , @entity128 @entity77 , was n’t particularly good ( he was also the ref who failed to send off @entity130 ’s @entity129 against @entity131 ) , but he did n’t break @entity7 ’s back .			1

referee @entity77 did not have a great game but he did not injure @entity7
@entity48 ’s @entity28 is the man *responsible* for the broken back
blaming the referee is an easy way out for footballers
