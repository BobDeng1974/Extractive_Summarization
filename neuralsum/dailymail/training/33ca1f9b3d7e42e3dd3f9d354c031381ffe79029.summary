he might be less than impressed by the @entity2 record on human rights but that was n't enough to stop prince @entity5 from visiting @entity7 's @entity6 to help usher in the @entity8			1
the @entity5 was on cheerful form and joked with performers dressed as dragons as he took in the colourful scene			1
with him was the @entity13 , who cut an elegant figure in a pretty cream cashmere skirt and jacket by @entity17 and a delicate printed silk scarf			0
during the visit , @entity5 and @entity13 were introduced to a number of @entity2 traditions , including calligraphy and dumpling making - both of which @entity40 pulled off with aplomb			1
@entity5 grinned as his wife attempted to make dim sum in the shape of fold and silver ingots , which are believed to bring you luck and prosperity , before watching a chop stick demonstration			1
@entity40 was a little more reluctant to try the trickier art of @entity2 calligraphy but was praised for her ' impressive ' first try at the character representing ' sky			0
while prince @entity5 chose not to show off his cooking skills , he did make a speech in which he revealed he and @entity40 were ' thrilled ' to be there and made an attempt at wishing revellers a @entity61 in @entity62			2
do n't eat me ! @entity5 steps hastily away from the ' dragon ' after cracking his joke what 's in there ? the @entity13 peers into the performer 's mask as they enjoy a chat looking good : @entity5 was accompanied by his wife , who looked lovely in a cream cashmere suit colourful : the royal couple were met by a group of dancers and performers dressed as dragons ' @entity80 [ @entity61 ] ! ' @entity5 told the crowds , adding : ' i rather hope the [ @entity2 ] ambassador [ @entity83 ] will give me a tutorial after			1
' he also cracked a joke about finding it difficult to tell the difference between the @entity62 for sheep and goat , both of which are called ' y√°ng ' , in a reference to the new @entity8			0
the eighth sign in the 12 - year @entity2 cycle , sheep are considered to be lucky in @entity96 and thus , sheep years are usually thought to be auspicious , particularly for finances			0
in @entity2 astrology , people born in sheep years are said to be peace - loving , kind and popular but also clingy and resistant to change			0
born in 1948 , prince @entity5 entered the world in the @entity104 , which , apparently , makes him charming but aggressive , talkative and sometimes stubborn			2
@entity5 , who did plenty of chatting during the visit , was also in @entity6 to highlight the work of the @entity108 , which was established by the @entity5 in 2008			2
celebration : @entity7 's @entity6 was awash with colour as the @entity8 began hello in there : @entity112 bent down to get a better look at the performer 's face inside his dragon costume that 's an unusual entourage : the dragons accompanied the couple as they toured @entity6 enjoying himself : @entity5 was on cheerful form as he watched the dragons in action culinary whizz : the @entity13 showed off her cooking skills and helped to make dim sum clever : the dumplings were shaped to resemble ingots of gold and silver and are thought to bring fortune based in @entity134 , it aims to ' promote mutual understanding ' between people from the @entity137 and @entity96			1
another of his charities , the @entity138 , also played a role in supporting and developing the concept for the @entity31			0
in his address , which was made to members of the community and benefactors of the centre , he hoped the building ' will be a platform for the exchange of ideas between the @entity154 and the @entity155 '			0
finishing with a flourish , he ended the speech by revealing that he and @entity40 were ' delighted to join you in celebrating the @entity23 '			2
speaking after the visit , @entity159 , owner of @entity160 which was visited by the royal couple , said : ' the first day of the @entity164 is the best day to take part in @entity2 traditions , it means it will certainly be a lucky and happy year for [ @entity5 and @entity40 ]			1
' he added : ' we spoke about all the different animals and i told prince @entity5 that i believed he was the year of the rat and @entity40 was the year of the pig - i was n't sure if he already knew that			2
' everyone in @entity6 is delighted that they have come here to celebrate with us			0
we are a big part of the @entity7 community so it 's great to see them taking pleasure in these traditions			0
' nearly done : @entity112 furrowed her brow in concentration as she neatly filled her dim sum difficult : @entity112 was a little reluctant to try calligraphy but eventually managed to complete a word @entity186 done : the @entity13 ' calligraphy was made up of two characters that spelled the word ' sky ' ta da : her efforts were met with a round of applause , with her tutors calling the work ' impressive ' well - earned : both prince @entity5 and the @entity13 enjoyed a cup of tea at the @entity31			1

@entity5 and @entity40 were in @entity6 to celebrate @entity23
the royal couple were met by dancers and performers dressed as dragons
@entity112 later tried her hand at calligraphy and making dim sum
2015 is the year of the sheep which is said to bring good fortune
@entity5 himself was born in the @entity104 , which *confers* charm
he showed it when he took the *opportunity* to try out his *cantonese*
