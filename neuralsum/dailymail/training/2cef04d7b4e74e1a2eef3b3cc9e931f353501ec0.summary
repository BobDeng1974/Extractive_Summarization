‘ it does n’t matter how much people pay for their flight , everyone is entitled to this			0
people probably think they have to go to court to do this but they do n’t , all they need to do is write to their airline			0
’ the @entity120 said mr @entity40 ’s legal victory appears to be the first in @entity10 since the @entity89 ruling			2
