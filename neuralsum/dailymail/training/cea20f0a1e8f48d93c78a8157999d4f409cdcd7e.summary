by @entity1 reporter last updated at 8:21 pm on 23rd december 2011 scores of people were injured yesterday when the @entity5 city of @entity6 was rocked by an earthquake			1
the tremor – the third in just over a year – came ten months after a massive quake struck the city killing 182 people			1
people ran into the streets when yesterday ’s 5.8 magnitude quake caused buildings to sway shortly before lunchtime			1
aftershocks : as dust rises from rocks , people in @entity6 experienced four violent aftershocks off road : cars in @entity6 became stuck in huge pot holes caused by the quake under water : the @entity28 and @entity29 areas of @entity6 pictured shortly after the earthquake roads cracked open and liquid gushed up from the sandy ground on which much of the city lies			1
a @entity36 jet bound for @entity6 had to be diverted			0
experts predict earthquakes will continue to hit @entity5 ’s second city for the next four years			1
one in ten residents is preparing to leave as it becomes increasingly difficult to rebuild			0
@entity6 , the largest city on @entity43 , has a population of around 367,000			2
@entity45 , associate minister for earthquake recovery , was among those shaken by the quake			2
she said : ‘ it was bad enough to have us diving under tables and grabbing each other			0
it ’s not what anyone needs at the end of a stressful year			0
’ it was not immediately known if anyone had died - but one person was injured at a city mall , four people were rescued after being trapped by a rock fall and 60 were treated for minor injuries			1
yesterday 's quake comes just 10 months after february 's magnitude - 6.3 - in almost the same spot - killed 182 people and crippled large areas			1
in september 2010 the area was hit by a magnitude - 7.1			2
the city is still struggling to reconstruct the hundreds of buildings damaged in both of the disasters , with every major aftershock creating months of additional delays because of its impact on global re-insurers who stand behind @entity5 's insurance firms			1
aftermath : @entity80 shovels liquefaction from the front of his @entity6 home which was struck by the earthquake holes in the ground : liquefaction is seen seeping out of roads across @entity6 devastation : a seismograph shows the effect of the @entity6 earthquake they have suffered huge losses because of the quakes , which has also wiped out the country 's $ 6 billion @entity97 insurance fund			1
@entity100 national chief economist @entity99 said his organisation had predicted after the september 2010 quake that the city could lose as much as five per cent of its population , @entity5 is dissected by the tectonic plate boundary between the @entity106 and the @entity108 - @entity107			1
the plate boundary is east of the @entity110 and crosses to the west of the @entity43			0
@entity6 is not on the plate boundary , but is near to related secondary faults that result from the bend in the plate boundary to the north			0
@entity117 's principal research fellow at the @entity119 dr @entity118 told @entity120 : ' in the past 200 years and in the long term , large earthquakes will occur less frequently in @entity6 than along the plate boundary			1
' however all earthquakes in the @entity6 region will be shallow , so the effect of a given earthquake will be worse than from a deeper plate boundary earthquake of the same magnitude			1
' @entity5 is more prone to earthquakes because it is on the plate boundary and has many plate boundary earthquakes			1
' but he told @entity134 that could now be a ' pessimistic ' prediction			0
he said : ' it could be , from today , that was being conservative			0
now , looking at @entity6 , that five per cent seems too light and you could be up to 10 per cent			0
' that has massive consequences for infrastructure , networking , the whole capability of the city			2
' in yesterday 's quake , fire engines , ambulances and police cars raced through the city to check on damage and casualties as people were asked not to use their mobile phones to keep emergency airwaves open			1
shoppers ran from supermarkets as goods crashed from shelves			0
some people received injuries as they fled to the safety of streets			2
more than 26,000 homes were left without power after the shaking tripped switches , cutting supplies			1
the first 5.8 - magnitude quake struck on friday afternoon , local time , 16 miles north of @entity6 and 2.5 miles deep , the @entity168 said			1
minutes later , a 5.3 - magnitude aftershock hit			2
about an hour after that , the city was shaken by another 5.8 - magnitude temblor , the @entity168 said , though @entity5 's geological agency @entity175 recorded it as 6.0			1
both aftershocks were less than three miles deep and the @entity177 did not issue an alert			2
the earthquake was felt as far north as @entity180 and @entity181 in the south			0
actress @entity183 tweeted : ' f * * k , that was terrifying			0
' film - maker @entity185 said : ' the noises that come with it … it starts with a little shake before it hits in			0
' i have friends down at the mall and they said there was stuff falling off the shelves and ceiling panels falling in			0
there 's a bit of panic			2
they said it 's chaos down there			2
' residents said serious thought would now have to be given as to whether the entire city should be abandoned for good , claiming the risks are too high and its future too uncertain			2
evacuation : although most of the buildings in @entity6 were evacuated cars became trapped in sinkholes after the quake second clean up : @entity215 and @entity216 clean up liquefaction from @entity218 in @entity219 broken banks : government officials survey a collapsed bank and broken water line on the banks of the @entity225 in @entity6 after the quake experts have predicted earthquakes will continue to hit the area for the next four years			1
many residents said insuring anything in @entity6 had become a ' nightmare ' and it was not ' worth their while ' to live there any more			0
callers flooded radio stations to tell of their individual scares			0
one caller to @entity238 said the quake was ' as vicious ' as the one in february			1

i just dived under the bench , ' said the caller			0
reporter @entity249 said : ' it 's absolutely frightening			2
my children are literally shaking and sobbing in my arms			0
that 's the worst bit			2

' but many residents said they were preparing for a follow - up quake or aftershocks which could be equally damaging			1
social media users told of their fears and how they were fed up with the quakes hitting the city			1

' police cars and ambulances rushing past			0
' the desire to live in other areas was also apparent among many			0
' if only we can relocate @entity6 somewhere else , ' said one man			0

not yet known if any *fatalities* : 26,000 homes without power
