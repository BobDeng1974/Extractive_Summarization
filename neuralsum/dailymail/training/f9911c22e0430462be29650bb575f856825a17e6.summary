@entity0 called those long , lonely nights out on the left wing under former @entity4 manager @entity3 the graveyard shift			2
@entity6 has the bodies in this squad - five in all - to fill the role , but @entity10 is his go - to man out on @entity4 ’s left			1
@entity6 is spoilt for choice on either flank and he will surely give into temptation when @entity4 experiment against @entity16 and @entity17 in @entity18 next week			1
@entity19 , if anyone , deserves a run			2
in @entity52 , during @entity4 ’s week - long training camp the at swish @entity50 do @entity49 resort , @entity10 spoke of his frustrations about life on the left flank			1
he wanted to compete with @entity25 and @entity24 for a central role in this @entity4 team , @entity6 prefers him on the left			1
it is there that he has made his mark with @entity4 , weighing in with a steady stream of goals during the national team ’s successful @entity47 qualifying campaign			0
@entity24 , who scored @entity4 ’s opener , is immovable			1
he is @entity4 ’s threat up front and the @entity69 striker is thriving with the responsibility of leading the line			2
immovable : @entity69 striker @entity24 is thriving as he leads the line for @entity4 @entity74 : @entity24 's stunning strike from the top of the box showed the quality he 's capable of producing @entity10 does n't have that confidence right now , but @entity6 is a loyal man and @entity10 is a willing servant			1
this has not been an easy season for the @entity28 forward and there is a feeling that his career at @entity85 is coming to a close			0
he did ok last night , nothing more than that on a night when @entity6 wanted to give a decent - sized @entity36 crowd a worthy send off before they head out to @entity18			1
@entity10 had a couple of decent touches , including a mazy first half run past four or five @entity35 players that should have ended with a free - kick			2
still , there must have been a temptation for @entity6 to start with @entity19 , the one man who has been on fire during @entity4 ’s two weeks together			1
at 18 he plays without fear			0
no fear : @entity19 brings a substantial spark to the @entity4 line - up when on the pitch late change : @entity19 came on for @entity25 in the 65th minute in @entity4 's 3 - 0 win over @entity35 @entity19 has conviction , one of the driving forces behind @entity69 ’s thrilling chase for the @entity112 title			1
he should have started at @entity36			0
you could make a case for @entity115 too after his exceptional performances for @entity117 in the final weeks of their title - winning season			0
@entity115 came on towards the end , but it was a pity that he did n’t get a decent chance to shine at the national stadium			0
his chance will come again			0
on the opposite wing @entity125 was neat and tidy in his third appearance , but he is still playing his way into this @entity4 team			0
@entity125 has all the ability , the technical touches required to play at the highest level			0
he also looks comfortable on either wing			0
neat and tidy : @entity137 's @entity125 showed promise on the right wing but is still playing himself in if @entity4 lack anything then it is those thrilling runs that @entity19 can provide with those dancing feet			2
his pace and those attacking instincts , to send defenders off balance by twisting and turning with those electrifying bursts , can be a real threat in tournament football			0
@entity19 ’s chance came in the 65th minute , adding a touch of glamour to the @entity4 team at a time when they were 2 - 0 up and cruising			1
there is an invincibility about him , an energy about his game that makes you believe anything can happen when he is on the ball			0
on wednesday , when @entity4 play @entity16 in @entity18 , expect @entity19 to get his chance to really bring this team to life .			1

@entity6 has an *embarrassment* of *riches* on the wings in his squad
@entity10 wants to play centrally but @entity6 prefers him out wide
@entity19 , who came off the bench against @entity35 , should start there in @entity18
@entity4 have two friendlies remaining against @entity16 and @entity17
@entity24 is relishing the chance to lead the @entity4 line
