by @entity0 more than a third of people wrongly believe being @entity3 positive prevents someone from working as a nursery school teacher , chef or with people with mental illnesses , according to new research			1
findings from a poll taken by 5,000 people showed that the public are ‘ in the dark ’ about the realities of living with human immunodeficiency ( @entity3 ) virus , the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) said			1
the survey findings , released on the 30th anniversary of the discovery of the hiv virus , showed one in five , or 20 per cent , of the public wrongly believe that people with @entity3 can only expect to live for 10 years after acquiring the virus , even if they are on treatment and not diagnosed late			1
more than a third of people wrongly believe that people who are @entity3 positive are not allowed to be chefs or nursery school teachers ( file picture ) only 16 per cent of respondents correctly stated that people with @entity3 can expect to have a normal life expectancy when they are being successfully treated and are not diagnosed late			1
the research also showed that more than a third ( 36 per cent ) of people wrongly thought that being hiv positive prevented someone from working as a nursery school teacher , a chef or with people with mental health problems			0
the charity said the only job that someone @entity3 positive can not do is work in the front - line armed forces , a ban applying to anyone with a long - term medical condition that requires daily medication			0
dentists , surgeons and midwives who are @entity3 positive can practice as long as they are monitored and their ‘ viral load ’ - the level of the hiv virus in their blood - remains undetectable , the charity said			2
a quarter of those surveyed , or 26 per cent , thought it was illegal not to disclose your @entity3 status to your beauty therapist , your gp , your tattooist , your dentist , your employer , or someone you are marrying			0
the @entity10 said there is no legal requirement to disclose your @entity3 status to anyone , except in very few specific jobs such as dentists , surgeons and midwives			0

@entity90 is the final stage of hiv infection , when the body can no longer fight life - threatening infections			0
with early diagnosis and effective treatment , most people with @entity3 will not go on to develop @entity90			2
the charity said an estimated 100,000 people are @entity3 positive in the @entity99 , of whom around 22,000 are thought to be undiagnosed			2
@entity101 , @entity10 chief executive , said : ‘ thanks to effective treatment , the situation for someone who is diagnosed with @entity3 today is a world away from that faced by someone who was diagnosed when the virus was first discovered 30 years ago			1
however people 's understanding has n't kept pace with medical advances			0
’ she added : ‘ misunderstanding and fear about @entity3 is not only damaging to those living with the virus but makes people reluctant to get tested			1
‘ in the @entity99 currently one in five people who have @entity3 do n't know they have it			2
‘ this can have devastating consequences for their health as well as increasing the risk of them passing @entity3 on to their partner			0
‘ in the absence of public awareness campaigns or compulsory sex education it is up to individuals to educate themselves and those around them about @entity3			0

20 ***%*** of people think those with the virus can only expect to live for 10 years
only 16 ***%*** of people realise they can have a normal life expectancy
