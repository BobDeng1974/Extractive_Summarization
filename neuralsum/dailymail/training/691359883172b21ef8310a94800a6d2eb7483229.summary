banned : @entity16 teacher @entity6 has been banned from the classroom for life after having sex with a 17 - year - old pupil in a hotel room after a night out clubbing in @entity22 @entity6 started working at @entity23 , @entity22 , in 2010 but his career was left in ruins because of his one - night stand with the girl			1
he was recommended for a five - year ban by a disciplinary body - but then education secretary @entity30 over-ruled it and prohibited him from teaching indefinitely			1
his downfall began on a saturday night in june 2012 when the then 23 - year - old met the teenage girl in @entity36 nightclub in @entity37 , where she was out with a group of friends			1
in the early hours he took her to a hotel room where they ‘ engaged in sexual activity ’ , a misconduct hearing found			1
after a disciplinary hearing in november that year , following a police investigation , he was sacked from @entity23			0
the misconduct panel said the girl was a ‘ very credible ’ witness and found the allegation of engaging in sexual activity with her proven			0
@entity6 did not attend the @entity50 of the @entity51 in @entity52 last month and his request for it to be heard in private was refused			1
they also found @entity6 guilty of failing to co-operate with the police investigation into a safeguarding matter , and attempting to mislead those responsible for investigating the incident by lying about booking into the hotel			2
@entity6 worked at @entity23 ( pictured ) from 2010 until he was sacked in 2012 following a disciplinary hearing			2
then education secretary @entity30 imposed a lifelong teaching ban the panel found his behaviour amounted to unacceptable professional conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute			0
the panel recommended a prohibition order should last for a minimum of five years because the girl had engaged willingly in sexual activity and was above the age of consent at the time and it was an isolated incident which had not been pre-planned			0
but @entity76 , on behalf of the @entity30 , said there was insufficient evidence that @entity6 had expressed remorse			2
he added : ' although he was a young teacher at the time , his behaviour was deliberate and he would have had no doubt that it was a serious breach of the standards that are expected of a teacher			0
' his behaviour is so serious that a review period is not in the public interest			0
' this means that mr @entity6 is prohibited from teaching indefinitely ... and shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of his eligibility to teach			0
