it was a blunder more normally associated with politicians arriving in @entity2			0
on the eve of the @entity6 , after weeks of painstaking closed training sessions , @entity4 coach @entity3 may just have given the game away			2
the former @entity10 star was photographed carrying what appeared to be coaching instructions for the @entity4 team – ahead of their eagerly awaited opening @entity6 clash against @entity17 on saturday night			1
but they might just have been handy for @entity4 ’s opponents seeking any clues as to their tactics in the competition , which begins in @entity43 tonight			1
the faux pas comes days after an @entity32 whiteboard was photographed inside the team ’s dressing room at the @entity47 in @entity48 , where they played a pre-tournament friendly against @entity51			0
in blue ink , under a series of tactical points , had been written : do n’t answer questions on falklands ! ! ! the latest paperwork , pictured as @entity3 was walking out to take a training session , suggested the @entity4 team have been working hard at their beachfront base in @entity61 under manager @entity62			1
the notes , scribbled in blue ballpoint pen on a team sheet , referred to the side ‘ supporting midfield players ’ and includes the penetrating insight that if the opposition win the ball they might ‘ counter straight away ’			0
blunder : @entity3 with sheet in hand ( left ) - and @entity75 's tips for a successful @entity4 campaign in @entity43 opinion was split last night on whether these would be @entity4 ’s tactics in the vital game – or just the sort of training ground routines used by football clubs up and down the country every week			1
there was even a suggestion the notes might be a double bluff by @entity3 and @entity62 as the pair prepared their players for their vital first game on saturday night			0
on the whiteboard photographed in @entity48 the words : ‘ we are ready for @entity17 ! ! ! ! ! ’ were also present			0
with temperatures expecting to reach @entity94 ( @entity95 ) , and 83 per cent humidity , @entity4 ’s opening game is likely to be incredibly draining on the team			2
whatever the notes @entity3 was holding – and whatever the tactics finally employed in @entity103 – the 39 - year - old ’s actions will keep opponents @entity17 guessing right up to the 11pm kick - off on how @entity4 will approach the match .			2
