criticism : @entity1 , chairman of the @entity2 , said that the increase in faith and free schools is stifling diversity the rise in @entity9 faith schools is breeding social and racial segregation in @entity11 , a leading equality campaigner said today			1
@entity1 , chairman of the @entity2 , said that the increase in faith and free schools is stifling diversity and stopping children from different races and backgrounds mixing			1
he was particularly critical of @entity9 faith schools because they have the least diversity			1
it came after 2014 saw a string of schools criticised over ' @entity23 ' plots by religious extremists and failures to protect students from radical material and influences			2
a report in july found there was a ‘ coordinated ’ campaign to introduce ‘ an intolerant and aggressive @entity33 ethos ’ into some of the city ’s schools			0
in total 21 schools investigated by @entity38 and several were found to be failing students and put into special measures			1
mr @entity1 , a former adviser to @entity41 when he was prime minister , singled out @entity9 faith schools as the least diverse in their intake and called for the government to take action			1
he accused the government of a ' certain amount of carelessness ' over its schools policy , in particularly that ' we have more schools and more faith schools and more free schools '			1
he told the @entity53 : ' it 's more by negligence than anything ; i do n't think that the government has deliberately promoted segregation but i think sometimes it pursues policies which are anti-integration and it is n't sufficiently aware of that			2
' @entity11 's becoming more diverse and if we do n't think about this and we 're not willing to act on it , the danger is we will become more separate ... there will be far too many places which feel like they 're just for the well - off and far too many places which feel like they 're just for the poor ; there 'll be far too many schools which feel like they 're just for one minority group of for just one social class			2
' probe : @entity76 in @entity77 was one of 21 schools investigated over the alleged @entity23 plot to introduce ‘ an intolerant and aggressive @entity33 ethos ’ into some of the city ’s schools ' if you were in the @entity86 and said , " a lot of these schools are not terribly integrated places " , you 'd have been brushed aside and told , " well that 's not actually a priority and that 's not the important thing - the important thing is that we have got more of these institutions "			1
the latest figures for the number of government - approved free schools across the @entity11 was 331 , accounting for 175,000 pupils , as of june 2014			0
in october plans for a voluntary code of conduct for faith schools were shelved by the government			1
this was despite even though it had been recommended by the cross-government task force on tackling extremism and radicalisation in order to prevent children being exposed to ' intolerant or extremist views ' in religious ' supplementary schools ' providing lessons outside mainstream education			0
a @entity86 spokesman said : ' our plan for education is designed to ensure every child of whatever background leaves school prepared for life in modern @entity11			0
ensuring they are well rounded young people , ready to play their full part in our society is a key part of that			0
' the best schools already have strategies in place to ensure their pupils are well integrated and this government 's policies are helping too			0
we have strengthened guidance to ensure all schools actively promote fundamental @entity11 values and that these are woven throughout the curriculum			0
' faith schools are an important part of our diverse education system and are popular with parents			2
we have made sure that all new faith academies and free schools can only prioritise half of their places according to the faith , while two thirds of new free schools have been created in some of the most deprived areas of the country ' .			0
