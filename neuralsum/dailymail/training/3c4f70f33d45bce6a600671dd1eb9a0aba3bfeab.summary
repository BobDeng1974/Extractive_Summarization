@entity0 has mercifully few memories of the car crash that almost killed her			1
but one thing she can never forget is the moment she realised , after waking from a two - week coma , that she could not move any part of her face			2
‘ i was in my hospital room , peering into a tiny mirror trying to smile , and this blank face looked back			1
i could n’t do anything			2
’ @entity0 examined her frozen face for just a few seconds before returning to her bed			1
yet , strangely , she did n’t panic or cry – having suffered horrific head injuries , her motionless features were the least of her worries			1
@entity18 smile : following her operation , @entity0 is trying to raise awareness about facial palsy ‘ i was having to learn to talk , walk and eat again so this was just another thing on top of it all , ’ she says			1
‘ the whole time in hospital was like being stuck in a bad dream			2
each day i just thought , “ tomorrow i ’ll wake up			0
” ’ she was suffering from bilateral facial paralysis , meaning in that single moment of impact , every one of the 40 muscles in @entity0 ’s face had been paralysed			1
her mouth was permanently open and dry , one eyelid was constantly closed while the other was stuck open			0
a staggering 100,000 @entity37 suffer from facial paralysis , usually affecting just one side			1
it condemns them to a world without the myriad expressions we communicate through our face			0
for @entity0 , the accident , which occurred in 2008 when she was 22 , left her with a skull fractured in four places , a bleed on the brain and traumatic injuries to the base of her skull that meant she had to be induced into a coma for 13 days			1
although she recovered , the paralysis was to become the most enduring legacy of the crash			1
it is only now that @entity0 can show her happiness once again thanks to an extraordinary ten - hour ‘ smile transplant ’ operation			1
before and after : @entity0 in 2007 before her crash , left , and four years later suffering from facial palsy , right until the accident , @entity0 , from @entity65 , @entity66 , had everything to look forward to			1
she was pretty , popular and bright			0
she had left school at just 17 , gone travelling in @entity70 and returned to fulfil her dream of training to become a veterinary nurse			0
during the second term of her university course , she decided to drive home for a weekend but skidded across a wet road , straight into the path of oncoming car			0
when she woke from the coma , everyone was just relieved @entity0 was alive			1
then they were relieved that despite her brain injury , she was able to move and to communicate , albeit with extreme difficulty			0
no one was overly concerned by her motionless face which doctors hoped would naturally heal itself			0
after two months in hospital , @entity0 was sent to a brain rehabilitation unit			1
within three months of the crash she was discharged from @entity92 care and sent home to her mother @entity94 ’s house			0
but by the fourth month of her recovery , the paralysis had begun to upset her			2
‘ i realised my face was n’t getting better			0
i had no advice , no support , nothing			0
i did n’t know what was going on			0
i was very depressed , very anxious and by this stage both eyes were stuck open and had to have drops put in all the time			2
’ procedure : how the operation was carried out it may seem extraordinary that a patient could be left with their eyes permanently open , but when her facial nerve was crushed , it meant the muscles that shut her eyes stopped working			1
facial palsy patients are usually able to open their eyes because this is a reflex controlled by a different part of the brain			1
but closing them requires muscles that are controlled by the facial nerve , which in @entity0 ’s case had been badly damaged			1
this meant her open eyes became dry and extremely sore , and often became infected			2
@entity0 tried to tape them down to sleep , then tried to cover them with an eye mask , but nothing worked			1
eventually she learned to roll her eyes up into her head so that she could sleep			2
although her mother was extremely worried and @entity0 was seen by an opththalmologist , at the time nothing was done			1
unfortunately , she now has blurred vision in her left eye , which may be as a result of the multiple infections			0
locked in a face that could n’t transmit even the slightest emotion was crippling for a once outgoing young woman			0
‘ it was horrendous being at home all the time , unable to go out because people would just stare at me in the street , ’ she says			0
after eight months , she went to see a neurologist who said nothing could be done for her facial palsy			2
sadly , @entity0 is not alone in enduring such a desperate and lonely time following paralysis of the face			1
it takes almost six years for the average patient with facial palsy to be diagnosed and offered appropriate treatment			2
many have already been through horrific experiences that triggered their condition , such as accidents , cancer , stroke , and the most common cause – @entity165 ’s palsy			0
others are simply born with it			0
even when a diagnosis is made and patients are offered one of the main types of treatments – physiotherapy , injections such as @entity175 to relax overactive muscles , or transplant surgery – many health authorities refuse to pay because the procedures are deemed cosmetic			0
last week , a charity called @entity182 @entity37 was launched by surgeon @entity183 to help these vulnerable patients get the care they need			0
it aims to educate gps about the condition so it can be diagnosed faster , and also to create specialist teams in every region who can see patients and assess which treatments would suit them best			0
mr @entity183 , a consultant plastic surgeon at the @entity195 in @entity196 , @entity197 , says : ‘ these patients deserve better			0
they have already been through terrible accidents or survived cancer			0
what they need now is not a fight with the @entity92 to get treatment			0
’ while @entity0 refuses to condemn the doctors who repeatedly failed to tackle her facial palsy or the health trust that tried to refuse funding for her eventual surgery , she concedes there were critical delays			1
it was not until two years after her accident , and while visiting @entity70 that she learned of a treatment that may have offered real hope			0
finally smiling : @entity0 after her operation , now able to smile and properly close her eyes in @entity219 , a friend took her to see an expert who told her there was an operation that might restore some function to her face			1
but on her return to @entity37 , @entity0 was given the devastating news that she had missed the window to have this surgery			1
the facial nerve , which runs up through the base of the skull and controls every muscle in the face , splits into two , controlling the left and right side of the face			1
in most people , only one side is damaged and only half of the face paralysed			0
to have both sides affected , as in @entity0 ’s case , is incredibly rare			1
the only movement she had regained was an ability to lift the left side of her mouth by a centimetre			0
in some cases , patients can have the pressure on the nerve relieved using steroids to reduce inflammation or possibly with surgery			0
however , this operation has to be done quickly before the nerve is completely lost			0
this is usually within a year of facial paralysis			1
the surgeon had to tell @entity0 she had arrived a year too late			1
‘ i just could n’t believe it			0
not one doctor told me , not one person seemed to know , ’ she says			0
luckily , @entity0 was introduced to mr @entity183 , who offers specialist ‘ smile transplants ’			1
he carried out a lengthy operation called a @entity265 procedure , during which the muscle that runs from the temple down to the jaw – the temporalis – is detached at the bottom			2
this is then rerouted and connected to the sides of the mouth			2
the temporalis is not the only muscle involved in jaw movement , so chewing and talking are not significantly affected			2
physiotherapy has helped @entity0 learn to gently raise the corners of her mouth using the redirected muscles , giving her what mr @entity183 describes as a ‘ @entity18 ’ smile			1
it might not be the beaming grin she once had , but with just two muscles she is learning to create a smile that most of us create with 14			2
@entity0 has also had surgery to insert a small platinum ‘ chain ’ a few millimetres long into her eyelids to help them close			1
alternatively , patients can have a tiny gold weight inserted into the eyelid			2
@entity0 says it ’s just the start			1
although her brain injury means she can not work because she still suffers from migraines and exhaustion , she is planning a move to @entity301 to start a new chapter in her life			0
‘ the other day i saw a woman at the supermarket and she smiled and i managed to smile back , ’ she says			2
still , she is far from cured			0
she can not pronounce the letter ‘ b ’ without pressing her hand to her mouth to create the right sound , a cruel twist for a girl called @entity0			1
she still struggles to move her lips and one of her biggest worries is that when she falls in love , will she ever be able to kiss the man of her dreams ? there are more operations ahead too , as her face will age differently to most and may start to sag			2
but although life is far from perfect , @entity0 has agreed to be a spokeswoman for @entity182 @entity37			1
‘ i want people to know about this condition and i want patients to get the support that was n’t there when i needed help			0
being part of this charity means i now have a positive reason for working harder and helping other people with facial palsy			2

@entity0 suffered full facial paralysis , but can now close her eyes and smile
muscle *tissue* have been connected to her *previously* *unmoving* lips and a weight has been placed in her eyelids enabling her to blink
