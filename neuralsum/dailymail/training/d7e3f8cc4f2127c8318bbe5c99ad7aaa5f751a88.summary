meeting : when @entity1 and @entity2 arrived at the @entity3 in @entity4 last year , they were whisked up to a private room for drinks with esteemed guests as they arrived at the @entity10 , the most lavish event in the political calendar , some of the guests dissolved into fits of laughter			1
the cause of the hilarity ? a bronze bust which was to be the highlight of the auction at the party at the fashionable @entity3 in the @entity21			1
as home secretary @entity23 , defence secretary @entity24 , and communities secretary @entity25 held court , there was much waspish chatter over the cocktails about who the bust was supposed to be			1
in fact it was @entity33 , as the guests well knew			1
it had been sculpted by the @entity38 - born @entity37 surgeon @entity36 , a long - time party supporter			2
but at the auction , at last year ’s june party , there were initially no takers for the bust , valued by mr @entity36 at £ 12,000			1
after what seemed an eternity , one of the richest men present finally intervened to spare the prime minister ’s blushes			2
@entity50 , a @entity52 - born @entity51 businessman , paid an astonishing £ 90,000 for the bust			1
he liked it so much he promptly donated it to the @entity55 , the bastion of the @entity10 establishment in @entity4 ’s @entity58 ’s			0
it is now ensconced in a corridor			0
one diner , who paid £ 12,000 for his table for a dozen guests , said : ‘ the auctions are always hideously boring but this was a hoot as people began chuckling out loud as the @entity69 ’s auctioneer tried in vain to shift the bronze			1
‘ there was a cheer when the @entity52 bought it but no one on my table could understand why anyone would want it			1
’ as for the prime minister , he was so relieved he raced over to mr @entity50 , who was on a table hosted by @entity25 , and slapped him enthusiastically on the back			1
mr @entity50 is a regular fixture on the @entity86 fundraising circuit			1
he has given either personally , or through his wind turbine farm company @entity88 , £ 348,000 since february 2012			2
as the guests took their places , on tables named after the 40 marginal seats the @entity94 have to win , it became clear why they will go into the next general election campaign with millions more than the @entity96			2
the total wealth of the guests – who included six billionaires and 15 worth more than £ 100million – was £ 11billion			1
the majority of the wealthiest guests came from the property and banking sectors but there is now an increasing number of multi-millionaires like mr @entity50 , who made their fortune after the collapse of the @entity109			1
conversation : the likes of @entity23 ( left ) and @entity25 ( right ) held court over cocktails while other guests discussed a bust , the highest priced item at the auction @entity118 : the total wealth of the guests at the @entity121 in @entity4 - who included six billionaires and 15 worth more than £ 100million - was £ 11billion in keeping with @entity33 ’s modern brand of conservatism , men were encouraged not to wear ties			1
there was not a long dress in sight			0
on his arrival the prime minister , in a plain blue suit , and his wife @entity132 , in a dress by @entity136 designer @entity135 , had been whisked into a closed upstairs room			0
they were entertained for 40 minutes to private drinks by the @entity143 financier @entity142 who has given £ 450,000 , and his wife @entity144 who was on the organising committee			2
mr @entity142 ’s firm @entity146 sponsored the party			2
also present were @entity148 , a @entity150 financier , and @entity151 , a billionaire investor , art collector and philanthropist			0
@entity153 , a friend of @entity33 ’s from @entity154 , who is joint chairman of the @entity86 with responsibility for fundraising , was a constant presence by the @entity137 ’s side			1
‘ this was the really serious money and this was their chance to have the undivided attention of the prime minister , ’ says one @entity86 source			0
‘ there were only about 20 in the room including @entity168 and @entity132			0
no one mentions money but it ’s clear to everyone why they are there			0
’ shortly before dinner , the @entity137 and his party returned downstairs to join the 459 guests to a polite smattering of applause			1
thousands of pounds had been spent on elaborate table arrangements of delphiniums and lupins so tall they obscured some of the diners ’ view of the people opposite them			0
@entity189 was off the menu in a nod to the age of austerity but there was no such restraint evident in the ticket prices which ranged from £ 400 to £ 1,000			2
after a starter of smoked trout , @entity33 gave a speech for just over 10 minutes , and the room erupted in sustained applause when he paid a warm tribute to @entity203 who had died two months earlier			1
known as the ' homeless billionaire ' , @entity205 is famous for not having a home despite his vast wealth			2
the 52 - year - old founder and president of @entity211 , a private investment company , was seated very near to the prime minister at last summer 's glittering @entity86 fundraising dinner ‘ some of the guests were in tears , ’ said one diner			2
‘ there was a huge roar of applause			0
it was the only time the room got going			0
’ after a main course of pan-fried guinea fowl stuffed with herbs and mascarpone the prime minister and @entity222 , the @entity4 mayor , toured the tables			0
‘ you knew which table @entity222 was at because of the noise and laughter , ’ says one senior mp			0
‘ @entity33 carries his office on his shoulders while @entity222 exudes warmth , wit and personality			1
it was obvious to everyone , including @entity33 ’s table , who is the biggest draw			1
’ when @entity222 returned to his table ( after the prime minister had returned to his ) he was clapped and cheered , taking his seat next to @entity245 , a @entity52 financier wanted in @entity247 in connection with allegations ( which he denies ) of a £ 220million fraud			1
he has been given political asylum in @entity51			0
he was also next to the @entity253 - born billionaire property developer @entity252 who gave money to @entity33 ’s leadership campaign in 2005			1
he lives with his wife @entity256 in neighbouring ‘ his ’ and ‘ her ’ mansions on a north @entity4 street dubbed @entity261			0
it may explain why @entity222 was locked in conversation with the couple for so long			0
one minister said : ‘ it was dreary but we are on a three - line whip to go because the donors want to see us			0
our tickets are paid for as we ca n’t afford those prices			0
even if we could , we would n’t unless we had to because the dinners are an absolute chore			0
it ’s too crowded , it ’s too noisy , and the auction goes on for ever			2
’ no one ever said that fund - raising was fun .			0

the total wealth of guests at the @entity3 was £ 11billion
during an auction at the party , a bronze bust was up for sale
it was bought by @entity52 businessmen @entity50 for £ 90,000
@entity33 encouraged the men not to wear ties at the event
