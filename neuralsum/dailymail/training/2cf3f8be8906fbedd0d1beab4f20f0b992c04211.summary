a free - kick in an attacking position should be a goalscoring opportunity but defenders reduce the risk by encroaching			1
as soon as the ref turns his back they look to gain two yards			2
it drives me mad ! it makes it harder to get the shot up and over the wall			2
the spray used yesterday stops defenders from cheating			1
it has been trialled in domestic leagues in @entity18 and @entity19 : let ’s get it into the @entity22 immediately			1
in action : the spray stops defensive walls from encroaching too far forward @entity26 proves he 's top class it was good to see @entity26 playing last night			1
he is a top quality goalkeeper who had a frustrating season before leaving @entity30 for @entity31 on loan			0
high flyer : @entity26 ( right ) showed on thursday evening why he is @entity18 number one keeper he was allowed to leave to reduce the wage bill and for no other reason			1
he is a very talented goalkeeper and technically excellent			0
let ’s see what happens to him next season			0
@entity18 are weak on the wings @entity18 have some terrific players but they are weak in the full - back areas			1
@entity43 and @entity44 want to be wingers			0
they leave a lot of space behind them and teams watching them last night will look to get in on the flanks against them			0
left behind : @entity54 ( left ) was not exposed defensively as he constantly pushed foward their whole defence might be the most talented of all time , but they are so good at going forward they sometimes forget to defend ! @entity60 thriving at being top dog @entity60 comes to life in a yellow @entity64 shirt			0
he ’s second in command to @entity66 at @entity67 but he thrives on being top dog for @entity18			2
golden boy : @entity60 is thriving under the pressure of being @entity18 's talisman two goals and he ’s off and running in the @entity74 race			1
but that penalty decision was horrendous , was n’t it ? a joke			0
the referee looked like he could n’t wait to give it too			2
i hope @entity82 do n’t suffer such an abysmal decision .			0
