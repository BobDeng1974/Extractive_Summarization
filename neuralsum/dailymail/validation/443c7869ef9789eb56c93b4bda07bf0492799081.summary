model , tv presenter and homeware designer ... is there anything that @entity5 ca n't do ? the national sweetheart , who wakes up the nation on this morning , has added another string to her bow by designing a range of vintage - inspired clothes for babies			1
speaking to @entity13 about her latest project with @entity15 , @entity5 , 34 , said : ' it ’s something i have been passionate about for quite some time ; this project has been about 18 months in the making			1
' i have a style that i have tried to bring into this range , which i hope feels fresh and blends the modern with vintage			2
' @entity5 , 34 , has extended her homeware range with @entity15 and has now ventured into designing a range of baby clothes inspired by vintage pieces and her own childhood memories the range , which lands in stores next week , has a strong vintage feel running throughout and each piece has an element that is reminiscent of a bygone era , from delicate frills to smart pinstripes			1
the mother - of - three , who created @entity40 boards to garner inspiration , said she worked extremely hard to ensure her range was full of great pieces that accounted for the practical needs of a mother and baby			1
to ensure the very best quality and comfort , @entity5 used only natural fibres to create breathable garments that she says will keep little ones cool throughout the summer months			1
' my main desire was for the collection to conjure up nostalgic memories from childhood such as swimming in the sea or trying ice cream for the very first time , ' she said			2
@entity5 , who says a good night 's sleep is her fail - safe beauty tip , shows off her new homeware range the range , which lands in stores next week , has a strong vintage feel running throughout and each piece has an element that is reminiscent of a bygone era , from delicate frills to smart pinstripes			1
@entity5 says she loves the ditsy dresses , which cost £ 10 , and would dress her daughter in one if she were younger @entity5 , who is mother to @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 , certainly has experience when it comes to dressing little ones - and said she designed her new range with her own offspring in mind			1
' i love the vintage florals , the soft tones and the fresh cotton dresses , ' she said			2
' i definitely like that look of soft colours , nothing too fussy or busy			0
my favourite pieces for girls are the ditsy floral dress and the grey woven romper ; if @entity72 was a bit younger i would love to see her in those			0
' i am very excited to see @entity73 in the boy 's pieces , i have ordered the whole range ! '			1
if that was n't keeping her busy enough , the presenter managed to find time to extend her home range with sir @entity102 's high street store , too			1
speaking about the additions to her homeware range , which has a similar vintage theme to her baby range , @entity5 said : ' we have added quite a few things ! we have thought about accent things for each room that you can layer in and build on your own look			1
' there are some incredible statement lights that you could pop into any room			0
it ’s not about chucking everything out and creating a brand new look in your house , i do n’t think that is practical or right			0
a home is what you build over years and years			0
' i like collecting things along the way and making them work within what i already have ; i guess that is why i have chosen such a mix of pieces but i think that they do all sit well together			0

i simply swear by trying to get a good night ’s sleep every night ... not that it 's always easy when you have a young family ! ' candles are very important , it just instantly makes a room nice so you feel calm and relaxed			0
' the new mother may have been keeping busy with her @entity15 projects but she 's not putting her feet up just yet			1
' there is lots more i want to do , ' revealed the ambitious celebrity juice presenter			0
' both of these projects have been a long - standing passion and i would love to keep building on this			0

' i just feel so lucky i got this chance to see ideas come to life and be able to finally buy the things i have had trouble finding in the past			0
