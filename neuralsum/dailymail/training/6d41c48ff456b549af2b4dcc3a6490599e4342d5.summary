by @entity0 three weeks ago @entity1 went with his wife @entity2 to visit the battle sites of @entity4 ‘ not because of the centenary , but because i ’m getting old and because i ’ve always been aware of the tremendous loss of life and personal sacrifice			1
’ @entity1 was so disturbed by the sheer horror of it all they cut short the trip			1
‘ we went to @entity14 where there are 42,000 gravestones and at least a third of them say : ' known only to @entity19			1
' ‘ we ’d gone with a terrific lecturer who was a professor of history and an ex-gurkha			2
a quarter of a million were wounded			2
they ’ve only found 42,000 under the ground we ’re walking on because the mud was so deep , so there are thousands and thousands of skeletons here still			1
' ‘ a few days later the @entity40 came back and took the hill again			2
so there was such an incredible loss of life for what ? it was so disturbing			2
’ this is a very different , reflective @entity1 to the actor who ’s brought so much laughter into our lives through tv comedy classics to @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			1
but @entity1 has extraordinary depth			1
next week he takes up a guest role at the @entity28 in @entity58 ’s @entity57 , based upon the book @entity59 by @entity60			1
taken from the @entity63 ’s recorded testimonies of the veterans of @entity4 , it is a series of vividly moving accounts of battle and its terrible aftermath			1
the play has already opened to rave reviews with @entity70 and @entity71 in the guest role			1
@entity1 will be followed by the likes of @entity74 and @entity75			1
‘ it ’s such a privilege to be able to express some of the things that happen to men in war , ’ he says			2
his home in @entity25 , @entity26 is lined with books — an early obsession			2
by the age of seven he had devoured the novels of @entity85 , and reading aloud to his primary school class led him into acting			2
after leaving grammar school at 16 , @entity1 won a scholarship to @entity89 , where his contemporaries included @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			1
@entity93 died shortly before @entity96 aged 81			2
last year , @entity1 was mourning his ‘ dear friend ’ director @entity97 , and before that the much - loved @entity99 star @entity91			1
video courtesy of @entity63 @entity1 appeared in comedy @entity102 ( pictured with @entity103 and @entity104 ) @entity1 recently went with his wife @entity2 to visit the battle sites of @entity4 but cut the trip short he is pictured with on - screen wife @entity108 in @entity109 ( left ) and right with her at @entity111 's memorial service and his contemporary @entity93 , who died before @entity96 aged 81 ‘ @entity113 [ @entity91 ’s wife ] is fine , ’ @entity1 tells me			1
‘ i was talking to her last week			1
’ and @entity97 ’s wife @entity116 ? ‘ she died a year after him			1
’ he is a kind , loyal friend and each death touches @entity1 , now 77 , deeply , as well as making him aware of mortality			1
‘ there ’s a bell up there , ’ he points to the ceiling			2
‘ when i was at @entity93 ’s memorial i was aware of that			1
’ @entity1 was just 13 when his best friend was knocked off his bike near his @entity130 home			1
‘ i went with a friend to see him in his coffin , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ in those days , working - class people used to lay the person out in the best room			0
there was my best friend — his name was @entity139 — lying in his coffin , his face probably made up a bit			1
‘ walking back from there , these two 13 - year - old boys talked to each other in a way they ’d never talked before in their lives because they ’d seen death			1
‘ it made me aware of love			1
that early , you do n’t realise you have loved			0
if it ’s a wife or a girlfriend , you know			1
but when you ’re 13 and it ’s a friendship , you do n’t know until someone is taken from you			0
’ @entity159 and @entity2 , to whom he ’s been blissfully married for 54 years , moved to their current home ten years ago			0
there are council flats on the street opposite their current home and it is n’t very flash			0
but , inside there ’s a huge vaulted hallway and floor - to - ceiling glass looking out on to an oasis of a garden			0
he likes the flats opposite — they ’re part of his roots			0
‘ i have a peculiar dichotomy in my background in that my parents [ his father was a chauffeur / butler and his mother a nanny ] worked for posh families but came from absolute basic stock , ’ he says			0
he is known for several tv comedy classics including to @entity52 , @entity53 and the @entity187 next week he takes up a guest role at the @entity28 in @entity58 's @entity57 , based upon the book @entity59 by @entity60 one such posting was at the massive @entity191 in @entity192 , where his father worked for the @entity193			1
‘ my father taught the @entity195 , who was a friend of the family , how to ride a bicycle			2
’ when the war came , @entity1 ’s father went to work in a @entity202 engine factory in @entity130			1
the family moved to a ‘ sort of @entity206 two - up , two - down , no bathroom and an outside lavatory where all the ladies left the doors open to talk to each other sitting on the loo			0
‘ inside the house my parents practised the sort of manners where if a lady came into the room , you ’d stand up			0
outside in the street it was the rough and tumble of real working class			0
i still go back sometimes and wander up and down the streets			0
’ at @entity89 , his @entity225 accent was knocked out of him			2
‘ when i came out , i did n’t know who i was , ’ he says			0
‘ that , if anything , hampered my acting			0
‘ my parents saved up for a @entity231 suit when i was 17			0
i wore it for interviews			0
most actors dressed as if they worked in a factory , in donkey jackets and caps			0
‘ and there was me , a working - class person , with this learnt accent and a suit			0
‘ the director @entity242 said : “ oh , @entity1 ca n’t act because i saw him in a suit			1
” funnily enough , not long ago , i went up for a part of a major - general in the @entity247			0
i ’d put on a suit and stood in front of these @entity250 who laughed			0
they said : " we ’ve never seen an actor in a suit before			2
" ‘ so i dropped my trousers and said : “ i ’ll read for you like this if it makes you happier "			0
' the young @entity1 would never have had such chutzpah			1
in fact , it was n’t until he was 50 that he finally ‘ knew who he was ’			0
he was appearing in @entity264 when its playwright , @entity265 , threw down the gauntlet one matinee			0
‘ he said : “ i want to see acting that i have n’t seen in the @entity269 theatre for 25 years			0
” he came to the dressing room later , threw his arms around me and said : " you ’ve done it ! " ‘ i realised the most important thing for an actor is not talent , it ’s confidence			2
at 13 , you are going to live for ever			0
‘ that ’s why those boys going to war at 17 or 18 went over the top : they did n’t understand their own mortality			0
when you get older , you do , and you think : " if only i ’d known how wonderful youth is			0
if only i ’d had the confidence "			0
