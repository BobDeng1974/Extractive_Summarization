big brown eyes , a wagging tail – and a nose so keen it strikes fear into drug smugglers far and @entity6 , the most successful sniffer dog ever , has capped off her career with her 100th find			1
now , after detecting £ 30million of cocaine – some 220kg ( 485lb ) – in seven years on the job , the record - breaking springer spaniel is getting ready to retire			1
@entity14 , 8 , who is based at @entity15 , is the most successful drug detection dog ever			1
on the streets , the 220kg cocaine she detected would have a street value of more than £ 30million			1
her handlers say the secret of her success is her unusually large nose and long muzzle			1
@entity28 , @entity29 said : ‘ she is by far the most successful drugs sniffer dog ever			1
getting 100 finds is an amazing achievement , and it ’s never been done before			1
’ @entity14 ’s handler is @entity34 , 29 , from @entity35			1
she lives with 12 other dogs at a top secret location near @entity15			1
away from work she is , he says , a sensitive dog , with a gentle personality			1
but when he puts her harness on , she is transformed			1
it is , @entity45 says , a ‘ superhero - type thing ’			1
@entity14 's handler is @entity34 , 29 , says the secret of her success is her unusually large nose and long muzzle ‘ when she is out and about here being her normal self she can be quite sensitive			1
but when she ’s working she is indestructible			1
‘ when she wants to find the drugs , there ’s nothing that will get in her way			1
once she puts her harness on she has these powers and she goes off and does what she has to do			2
’ when she finds the scent , @entity14 will indicate at the strongest point of smell with a ‘ freeze stare ’ , focused on it with her eyes and nose			1
such is her sense of smell , she can even smell cocaine dissolved inside another liquid in a bottle , or the sweat of cocaine on the hands and feet of smugglers who have swallowed – or otherwise deposited the drugs inside their body			1
mystery surrounds her birth and origins – she came from the @entity78 but before that it is unclear			2
her relationship with @entity45 did not get off to the most auspicious of starts			2
‘ she rolled over and weed on me , ’ he said			2
but from that point on , they ’ve never looked back			2
in their first year , sniffer dogs in training are not expected to make even one find ; @entity14 made ten			1
since then , she ’s broken every record going			2
@entity14 was a protégée of the now retired @entity89 , another @entity90 , who retired in 2007			1
a picture of @entity89 hangs in the headquarters of the sniffer dogs near @entity15			2
its inscription reads : badger : ‘ a @entity97 ’ 2001 - 2007			2
the sniffer dog base is in a secret location , unmarked from the road , and hidden from view by trees			1
security is taken seriously : some years ago the name of a dog – now retired – was found by the @entity107 at the home of a notorious drug baron in @entity110			2
the animal – which has not been identified – had been put on a hit list , and had a price on its head , because it had intercepted a particularly large consignment of drugs			1
and a few months ago there was a scare when a dog died			2
there were fears an organised crime gang operating in the airport might have slipped the dog a poisoned biscuit			2
a full investigation was carried out and suspicions were allayed – the animal died of intestinal problems and had n’t been poisoned			2
at the base the dogs live in relative luxury – under overhead lamps and heat reflective floors			0
in the pack , @entity14 is n’t the top dog , @entity45 says , but does n’t get in to scraps			1
‘ everyone gets on with @entity14 – she is very popular , ’ he says			1
for six months she went off the boil – and @entity45 was worried she might be slowing down because of her age			0
but after a visit to the dentist she bounced back to life			0
the problem had been a rotting tooth giving her toothache			0
now coming to the end of her working life , you would expect her work ethic to have eased off			0
but not a bit of it , @entity45 says			0
the only day she allows herself a lie - in , he says , is when she ’s not working			0
‘ even at eight she is really active , a real pro. she wakes up in the morning with the rest , but if she sees it ’s not me then she will go back to bed			0
’ around the airport , @entity14 is something of a celebrity – having appeared on a series of documentaries set in and around the airport			1
‘ people are always recognising her , ’ says @entity45			0
i just drive her around now and let her get on with the job			0
people say i ’m just her driver			0
’ he admits that , when her last day comes – expected to be within months – it will be an emotional day			0
‘ to see her be so successful , to go after seven years , it ’s going to be a bit upsetting , ’ he says			0
‘ she has done me proud ’			0
‘ it ’s going to be a tough transition ’			0
‘ she ’s doing it for herself but she is also doing it for me – because i ’ve asked her , and that ’s the bond coming through			0
’ when her retirement day comes , she will go home with @entity45 and live with him or , when he ’s at work , with his parents			0
‘ she has been an amazing dog			0
she knows exactly what to do			0
i can take a step back and let her get on with it			0
i never have to gee her up			0
‘ i will miss her when she goes			0
it ’s going to be an emotional day to see her go			0
she is one of the greats			0
