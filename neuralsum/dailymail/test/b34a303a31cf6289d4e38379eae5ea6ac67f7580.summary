the @entity1 fans in the @entity2 applauded their team at the final whistle			1
it was not the victory manager kit @entity7 had called for but a point away to @entity9 probably secures their future in the @entity12 next season			1
they are eight points clear of @entity14 and bar a miraculous resurgence from one of the bottom three sides will stay up but the fact relegation is still mathematically feasible for a club that were in the @entity21 last season is alarming			2
a vertiginous decline , just one victory in their last seven games had seen them dragged back into a relegation battle and after a painful 4 - 1 trouncing by bitter rivals @entity29 last week , @entity7 was looking for a quick response from his players			0
@entity32 celebrates his first - half effort as @entity9 come from behind to earn a point the @entity36 winger is joined by his @entity9 teammates as they celebrate his equaliser at @entity39 he got it with @entity41 giving them the lead after eight minutes			1
a superb long ball by @entity45 found @entity46 who headed on to the @entity47 to loop the ball over the top of @entity9 goalkeeper @entity50 in front of the 1620 travelling fans in the @entity53 stand			2
the passage of time has clearly not dulled the bad feeling @entity9 fans harbour towards @entity58			1
the midfielder , who missed the @entity29 game through illness , departed the club more than a decade ago but his every touch of the ball was greeted by a chorus of boos			0
not that it seemed to affect him as he dictated the pace of the game in the early stages , feeding striker @entity46 well			0
@entity41 headed over a stranded @entity50 with just eight minutes played in @entity70 @entity41 celebrates his goal in front of the traveling @entity1 fans with just eight minutes played @entity9 : @entity50 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity32 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 ( @entity81 70 ) @entity82 ( @entity83 79 ) @entity73 subs : @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 @entity1 : @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity45 , @entity93 , @entity58 , @entity94 , @entity95 , ( @entity96 68 ) , @entity97 ( @entity98 68 ) , @entity46 , @entity41 subs : @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 but @entity9 hit back with a 16th minute equaliser			1
@entity107 ’s cross bounced across the front of goal and @entity80 swung a leg at it but could not connect			0
it was left for a waiting @entity32 to fire his 10th goal of the season into the top right corner			1
goalkeeper @entity90 , who seemed rooted to the spot , wisely dragged a furious @entity93 , who seemed to believe the goal offside , from a confrontation with the linesman			0
almost the whole stadium thought @entity32 had nabbed his second when @entity82 set him up with the whole goal to aim at but the winger contrived to miss , hitting the side netting instead			2
the second half was low in quality but high in chances			0
the visitors seemed reenergised after the interval , forcing a save in the 46th minute			0
@entity46 found space in the centre of the box and got his head on a pinpoint @entity93 cross but @entity50 did well to thwart the effort			0
@entity9 soon asserted control with @entity73 going close three times before @entity58 was booked for bringing him down with a late challenge			1
the @entity9 players were outraged when referee @entity141 awarded @entity1 a free kick 25 yards out deep into stoppage time but @entity41 blasted the ball over the bar			1
@entity74 and @entity146 fight for the ball during match between @entity9 and @entity1 @entity1 now sit 20th in the table eight points clear of fellow @entity70 rivals @entity14 , but @entity7 is refusing to relax just yet			1
he said : ‘ we ’re definitely not safe until it ’s mathematically sure because this league is topsy turvy at both ends and it is going to go to the wire			0
' but i ca n’t be greedy so i will take the point and i was pleased with the performance			0
’ @entity73 skips past @entity158 during the @entity12 match @entity39			2

@entity41 gave @entity1 the lead after eight minutes at @entity39
but @entity32 leveled the scores less than ten minutes later
@entity58 was booed on his return to club , *11* years after he left
share of the points in @entity70 leaves @entity9 in *11*th and @entity1 in 20th
