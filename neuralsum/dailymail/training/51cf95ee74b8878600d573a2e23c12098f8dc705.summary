by @entity0 an @entity2 employee has filed suit with the company claiming that racism has led to him being denied a promotion			1
@entity7 , 31 , of @entity8 , @entity9 , says in the suit that he took his concerns about african - americans being denied opportunities for advancement all the way to ceo @entity16 , but that he was ignored and left with no choice but to take his case to court			1
a complaint filed december 18 with the @entity21 obtained by @entity22 details management ’s alleged preference for white employees			2
he also claimed that a manager once told him that ‘ black employees do n’t reach management in this market , ’ in an interview with the website			1
where it happened : the @entity34 at the @entity35 , in @entity8 , @entity9 ‘ when i was in the @entity39 under the supervision of [ redacted ] , senior manager , she had make a statement prior to me transferring to @entity43 that @entity44 in the @entity8 location do n’t have a chance to make it to management , ’ the document reads			2
‘ i did not express my concern to management at that time because i was transferring to @entity43			2
’ he the dramatically increased the results of the tech giant ’s ‘ @entity52 , ’ which encourages shoppers to make in - store purchases from their @entity2 devices , from 1.4 per cent of total sales to 14 per cent after arriving in @entity58 , he said			2
@entity7 believes those results merited a promotion			1
‘ i did numbers myself and then i trained employees			0
i wrote a full synopsis to make it a sustainable goal for entire store , ’ said @entity7			1
he then decided to return to the @entity66 after a year down under and was rebuffed by the @entity8 store			0
taken all the way to the top : @entity7 claims he voiced his concerns directly to @entity2 ceo @entity16 , but was instead offered a meeting with two human resources representatives ‘ i was not given a job , despite being told that i was going to be given a transfer , because of one manager ’s racism , ’ insisted @entity7			1
‘ i blew the horn as loud as humanly possible and they did nothing , ’ he continued			0
‘ i want the focus to be on @entity16 , @entity2 and their failure to address the racism in the company			0
racism that they knew about			0
’ the document further explained @entity7 ’s claims			1
‘ once [ redacted ] got involved with the transfer process i was denied a transfer to a management or leadership position			1
there are no blacks at the @entity39 that hold a leadership position or have opportunities to be promoted to management position			2
‘ i believe that my upward ability at the @entity39 is being hindered by [ redacted ] intention to discriminate against @entity44 who are qualified to a hold a management position , ’ says the lawsuit			2
@entity7 further illustrated his claims of being discriminated against by recalling the time a white manager even musing about @entity106 singer @entity105			1
‘ i ’ve heard her referencing @entity105 having more talent than other @entity106 artists and it pissed her off that black artists say he stole their style of music and that he ’s so popular because he ’s a white artist doing black music , ’ he claimed			0
@entity7 took his claims directly to the top , asking august 28 , 2013 , via email for a meeting with @entity16 , but was instead offered a talk with two human resources representatives the following month			1
that meeting instead happened in october 2013 , but nothing came of it , said @entity7 , leading to him filing his lawsuit			1
‘ i filed my complaint because of what i have seen and heard in my market , ’ he said			0
‘ you hear it so much that you get numb to it			0
‘ then i tried to move up the ladder and nothing happened			0
i watched people around me who did less work getting promoted and none of them were black			0
the last straw was when my manager destroyed my chances of moving up			0
’ an @entity2 spokesperson told @entity22 that the company responded to his claims earlier this month but offered no further comment .			0

@entity7 claims he was denied a promotion at an @entity143 by racist management
he insists there is not a single black person in a leadership or management role at the store
@entity7 *'s* *attempts* to resolve the issue *internally* achieved nothing and left him no choice but to file a lawsuit , he said
