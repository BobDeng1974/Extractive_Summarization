you might think it was a feat only achievable in the world of cartoons			0
but that did n't stop one pair setting themselves the challenge of going on all 46 rides at @entity9 in just one day			2
and after running a total of 22 miles across all four parks in a frantic 17 - hour dash , @entity10 and @entity11 , 46 , can now celebrate the fulfilment of a childhood dream			1
mr @entity10 , 41 , said : ' it 's not like we 're solving world hunger , but it 's fun to have a little challenge that no - one has ever done before and people think is impossible			2
' @entity10 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) went on all 46 rides in @entity9 in one day the pair met 20 years ago on a chat room dedicated to theme parks after revealing to each other that they both would visit @entity9 every year as children , reports the @entity27			1
they came up with the idea for the challenge after mr @entity10 mentioned that he would often only have one day to visit the park , meaning he would try to fit in as many rides as possible			2
remarkably , the pair only met for the first time last year when they tried the attempt for the first time			1
but bad weather meant three of the attractions - @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 - were closed by the end of the day			1
they planned their second - and successful - attempt on november 7 and documented their exploits on their website			0
@entity48 in the @entity49 , one of the four parks the pair dashed across to take all the rides the @entity54 attraction was one of the 46 rides the pair rode to complete their epic 17 - hour challenge after meticulous planning and armed fastpass tickets to skip the longer queues , they began they adventure at the @entity63 at 8am			1
they then also took all the open rides at the three other parks - @entity67 , @entity49 and @entity68 - with 15 minutes to spare before the site closed at 1am			1
with the spare time , they chose to cap it all off by re-visiting four of the rides to finish with a round 50 for good measure			0
' if you 're an average guest here on vacation this is not something you want to be doing , ' @entity76 told @entity82			0
' it 's very much like running a marathon throughout the day			0
