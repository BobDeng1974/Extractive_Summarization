they came back with a verdict within four hours			0
after it was read , judge @entity101 informed the jury that the death penalty had been taken off the table and therefore their service was done			2
prosecutor @entity107 told reporters dropping the death penalty had been necessary to get @entity23 's defense team to agree to let the judge dismiss a particular juror because of ' a situation ' that contributed to the deadlock			1
