appeal : the three members of punk - rock band @entity2 sit in a glass - walled cage in the court room before the beginning of the hearing at the @entity12 this morning but sympathy for @entity2 is limited in @entity3 , where @entity125 has cast the protest as part of an attack meant to curb the church 's @entity130 revival in a nation where most people are @entity25			0
