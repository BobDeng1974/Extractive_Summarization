patrons have come out in droves in support of an iconic hotel refusing to serve cyclists due to a ' no - lycra ' policy saying they lose their appetite at the sight of the acquired look			1
the overwhelming reaction was sparked after four lycra - clad cyclists were told they could not have brunch at the @entity3 in @entity12 on sunday - despite being regular customers who had only just dined there the week before			1
hotel patrons have expressed their disgust at the clothing that cyclists wear and are calling on the riders to wear looser clothing because their revealing attire puts them off their food			1
' this decision was never a dress code issue , and if dress was communicated as the reason by our staff then we apologise for the misunderstanding and assure everyone that this is not the case , ' the hotel posted on its @entity56 page			2
described as the ' lycra 'd loonies ' , patrons lashed out on the post not only complaining about the revealing look but also the smell and sweat that they claim is left behind on the seats			1
' lycra 'd loonies , after pedalling around the countryside for hours , tend to get a bit on the nose , and there 's nothing worse than a bunch smelly , sweaty cyclists sitting near you to put you off your tucker , one patron said			1
' a good move by the publican , but he 'd better be ready for a flood of these @entity78 'd loonies descending on him just to get some publicity			0
' @entity81 said that he was at the pub on saturday when three lycra clad riders came in for lunch			1

' @entity133 suggested that the riders to ' stick to coffee shops '			0
who wants to see fat old men having some mid-life fitness crisis busting their fat guts while parading their tackle at my eye level when i take a seat , ' he posted			0
' although we all appreciate that you have taken the initiative to get fit please be considerate of others			0
' your clothing is quite revealing you have just ridden countless kilometres in the sun and some not all of you are on the nose			0
' @entity152 echoed those sentiments			0
' why do n't you do the polite thing like the rest of us and get out of your smelly exercise clothes and have a shower before heading somewhere for a pint or coffee ? ' she posted			0
' i do n't head to a restaurant or a coffee bar straight after the gym and i would be refused so why should you be treated differently because you have a hot shot bike and fancy clothes ? ' @entity167 suggested that cyclists open their own cafe			1
' that way the rest of the public dont need to sit in the sweat of cyclists mid way through their exercise , ' he said			2
' do n't really want to have coffee while 5 men walk past with their lycra clad junk at eye level either			1
' @entity185 , along with his wife and two friends , were denied service at @entity3 for wearing lycra the age - old issue resurfaced its ugly head on sunday morning when outraged customers were denied their regular sunday brunch at the local hotel because the keen cyclists were dressed in lycra			1
@entity185 walked into the @entity3 to grab a table ahead of his wife and their two mates , who had all just gone on a morning cycle , when he was approached by a staff member who confronted him with an unexpected remark			1
' sorry mate you ca n't come in here - we 've got a no lycra - free policy - we ca n't serve you , ' the waiter said			1
mr @entity185 was gobsmacked and told his companions as they walked in that they were not welcome due to their cycling attire			1
' i 've never been spoke to like that - it was horribly humiliating , ' mr @entity185 told @entity211			2
' i 'm 43 years old and a father of two kids - i 've never been kicked out of anywhere in my life - let alone for the clothes i was wearing			2
' his wife , @entity217 , questioned the waiter when the policy had been put in place and the waiter replied with two weeks ago			2
' my wife pointed out that we were served in lycra the week before and then he walked away , ' he said			1
mr @entity185 insists the move is blatant discrimination			0
' i think most pubs and clubs want young people who are hip and do n't like the older crowd as a general rule , ' he said			0
' people do n't like the way we look			0
' ' it would be considered discrimination if it happened to people with dogs or kids - or customers wearing high visibility clothing			2
' hotel management said there was no such policy but a concern for safety where some bikes were parked @entity211 approached the hotel for comment but has yet to have heard back			1
however , @entity253 operations manger @entity252 denied there was a lycra ban to the @entity256 saying the concern was residents complaining about some of the parked bikes causing a safety risk			1

' mr @entity252 said the incident was a miscommunication which has now been clarified with the staff			0
but mr @entity185 said the hotel 's response was complete nonsense and that the message could not have been misconstrued			0
' it 's an absolute smokescreen - it 's just spin , ' he said			0
' there was no ambiguity - he was clear about the policy			2
' animosity towards cyclists is not a new issue and mr @entity185 , who owns the @entity287 shop in @entity12 , said everybody needed to ' take a chill pill '			1
