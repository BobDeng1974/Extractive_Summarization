i remember @entity7 as a person who gave me friendship from the very beginning			0
' if i am convicted i understand that i will be seen as a fugitive but i will continue to fight until the end			0
' while @entity8 arrived at court today for the final hearing ahead of the verdicts , @entity11 has already said she will not return to @entity18 , where there is no statute of limitations for murder , if she is found guilty			1
the court hearing today began with the last round of rebuttals by @entity11 's defence team closing four months of arguments in the third trial for the brutal 2007 murder			1
@entity11 's lawyer @entity76 told the court he is ' serene ' about the verdict because he believes the only conclusion from the case files is ' the innocence of @entity2 '			2
co-defendants : @entity8 is on trial for @entity7 's murder alongside his former girlfriend @entity11 @entity8 faces being jailed for a second time if found guilty of the 2007 murder of @entity7 a @entity10 appeals panel , designated by @entity18 's supreme court to rule on the case , deliberated on the case support : @entity8 is flanked by his stepmother @entity92 , left , and his aunt @entity93 , right , as he leaves court after attending the final hearing before the third verdict for the murder of @entity99 student @entity7 @entity7 , the barman @entity11 wrongly accuse of @entity7 's murder , speaks to the media outside the @entity104 courthouse in @entity10 where the verdicts are expected later today it comes after six years of trials and investigations have so far failed to clear up mysteries surrounding the murder of @entity111 , 21 , who was found stabbed to death in her bedroom in the picturesque town of @entity17 , where she shared a student flat with @entity11			1
@entity11 , 26 , and @entity8 , 29 , were convicted of the murder in 2009 and spent almost four years in jail , but the verdicts were overturned on appeal and @entity11 immediately returned home to the @entity4 upon her release in 2011 , where she has remained			1
however , last year , @entity18 's highest court quashed the appeal ruling due to what it called ' contradictions and inconsistencies ' and ordered a retrial			0
the case has played out through the media as much as through the courts , propelling @entity11 and @entity8 to something approaching celebrity status in their home countries			2
armies of bloggers battle over disputed evidence about the case online			0
new look : @entity2 unveiled a dramatic new haircut in @entity13 yesterday ahead of judges delivering their verdict in the @entity7 murder trial today changes : @entity11 has been trying to keep a low - profile in @entity13 where she has returned to her studies at the @entity151 @entity11 , pictured yesterday covering up her short hair in a hat , has already said she will not return to @entity18 whatever the outcome of the retrial supporters of @entity11 in the @entity4 have done much to transform an initial public image of her as a sex - obsessed party girl , which critics say prevented a fair trial , to one portraying her as a victim of a faulty justice system			1
the @entity111 family has repeatedly called for the full truth to come out about the case , and the victim 's brother @entity170 and sister @entity172 are expected to be in court today to hear the verdict			2
@entity11 has pleaded her innocence in an email to the court			0
@entity8 arrived at court for the final hearing today ahead of the verdict later today which could lead to his immediate detention or house arrest			1
the prosecution has asked for @entity8 and @entity11 to be jailed for 26 years for the murder and for staging a robbery to cover it up			2
it has also asked for a separate sentence of four years for @entity11 for a standing slander conviction , for falsely implicating @entity188 bar owner @entity7 in statements to police in which she described hearing her roommate scream			2
' face of an angel ' : @entity2 pictured left in 2008 when she first went on trial for the murder of her roommate @entity7 , pictured right suspects : @entity2 pictured with @entity8 shortly after @entity7 's murder the prosecution says this points to her guilt , but @entity11 has said she was confused and spoke under duress			1
lawyers for @entity8 and @entity11 argue that only one person is guilty of the murder : @entity206 - born @entity7 , who is serving a 16 - year sentence for sexually assaulting and stabbing @entity111			1
his trial found that he did not act alone because of the number and variety of @entity111 's more than 40 wounds			0
the initial case argued that @entity11 and @entity8 had killed @entity111 in a sex game gone awry , but the prosecution has moved away from this interpretation in the current appeal			0
the retrial has focused on a re-examination of dna evidence			0
in closing defence arguments , @entity8 's lawyer argued that a trace of his client 's dna on a metal hook on @entity111 's bra clasp was there due to contamination , because it was not collected from the crime scene until more than a month after the murder and was repeatedly touched			0
tears : an emotional @entity11 , pictured in 2011 , after her guilty verdict was overturned following an appeal return : @entity11 , pictured on the @entity236 in september , has denied she had anything to do with the 2007 murder the defence and prosecution contest whether @entity111 's dna was on the blade of a kitchen knife from @entity8 's apartment , which had been used by @entity11			1
whatever the verdict , one side is likely to challenge it , and it will have to be confirmed by @entity18 's high court to become definitive			0
@entity18 could ask for @entity11 to be extradited to serve any sentence , but her legal team is likely to challenge this			0
additionally , @entity11 has appealed her slander conviction to the @entity255 , one of a plethora of spin - off cases from the trial , and could do the same if convicted again of the murder .			2
