by @entity0 from @entity2 to the @entity3 , smog frequently shrouds @entity5 ’s famous landmarks in a grey haze			2
but as well as ruining the view for tourists and posing a health risk for locals , the air pollution over @entity9 ’s largest cities has been found to affect weather all over the world			1
a team of @entity18 scientists discovered that aerosols created by humans in @entity9 economies impact storm formation in the @entity18 and beyond			1
the almost hidden city : from @entity2 to the @entity3 ( pictured ) , smog frequently shrouds @entity5 's famous landmarks in a grey haze and the air pollution has now been blamed for storms further afield @entity28 greeted @entity30 teams in @entity31 for the forthcoming @entity32 this weekend			2
it was uncertain that the practice was going to go ahead as factories in town and car exhaust fumes contributed to 214micrograms per cubic metre - three times the national limit			0
the @entity18 @entity40 warned that people with ‘ heart or lung disorders , older adults and children , should avoid all physical activity ’ outdoors , while healthy adults should still avoid prolonged or heavy exertion			0
the particles are dangerous as they can go deep into the lungs			0
the race is thought to be unaffected , particularly because factories will shut over the weekend			0
pollutants frequently reach dangerous levels in @entity55 while emissions in @entity57 often exceed the @entity59 ’s recommended levels , which affect the health of people in the cities			1
scientists compared air pollution rates from 1850 to 2000 and found that man - made particles from @entity9 impact the @entity67 storm track that can influence weather over much of the world			1
a team from @entity75 , @entity70 , the @entity71 and @entity73 ’s @entity72 ( @entity72 ) used detailed pollution emission data compiled by the @entity77 and looked at two scenarios : one for a rate in 1850 before the industrial era and one from 2000			2
by comparing the results from a global climate model , the team found that aerosols impact cloud formations and mid-latitude cyclones associated with the @entity67 storm track			1

aerosol particles from @entity9 affect storms sweeping across the @entity67 and subsequently the weather patterns in @entity92 and the rest of the world , the scientists said ‘ there appears to be little doubt that these particles from @entity9 affect storms sweeping across the @entity67 and subsequently the weather patterns in @entity92 and the rest of the world , ' said @entity100 , a previous researcher at @entity75 and employee at @entity72			1
‘ the climate model is quite clear on this point			0
the aerosols formed by human activities from fast - growing @entity9 economies do impact storm formation and global air circulation downstream			1
‘ they tend to make storms deeper and stronger and more intense , and these storms also have more precipitation in them			2
we believe this is the first time that a study has provided such a global perspective			0
’ in recent years , researchers have learned that atmospheric aerosols affect the climate , either directly by scattering or absorbing solar radiation , or indirectly by altering cloud formations			0
could storm damage in the @entity18 become a frequent occurrence ? the aftermath of @entity125 is pictured			0
researchers found that aerosols impact cloud formations and mid-latitude cyclones associated with the @entity67 storm track increasing levels of such particles have raised concerns because of their potential impacts on regional and global atmospheric circulation			1
dr @entity100 said large amounts of aerosols and their long - term journey from @entity9 across the @entity67 can clearly be seen by satellite images			2
the pacific storm track transports heat and moisture across the ocean and the scientists think it is intensified by the air flow of pollution generated in @entity9			1
‘ our results support previous findings that show that particles in the air over @entity9 tend to affect global weather patterns			2
it shows they can affect the @entity154 ’s weather significantly , ’ dr @entity100 said			0
pollutants frequently reach dangerous levels in @entity55 , @entity5 , while emissions in @entity57 , @entity158 , often exceed the @entity59 's recommended levels , which affects the health of people in the cities			1
