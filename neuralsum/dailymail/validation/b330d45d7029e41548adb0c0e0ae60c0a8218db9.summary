@entity0 revealed he sought inspiration for the biggest home tie in his @entity4 career by visiting the home of @entity7 football			1
@entity0 took time out of his preparation for the @entity10 encounter with the @entity11 to take a private tour of @entity13			1
the @entity14 admits he will be nervous when he turns out in front of his home crowd on friday , saturday and sunday at the @entity17 and his trip to a more established @entity7 sporting venue helped him reflect on the encounter to come			2
@entity0 hits a shot as part of his practice session at the @entity17 in @entity24 on wednesday @entity0 , wearing a t - shirt with a tweet from a fan pledging support , is part of the @entity30 team taking on the @entity11 the recently - announced @entity31 will have the backing of home support in @entity24 this week @entity0 said : ' i just went and had a little walk around and saw the locker rooms and changing areas and went on to the pitch , which was nice			1
' i had only been once to @entity13 before for a cup final which @entity40 lost			2
' it was nice to go down on the pitch and see what it was like			2
' the @entity17 will only hold about a seventh of @entity13 's 50,000 capacity but @entity0 expects the crowd to play a significant role in the first - round encounter			1
' for all of us as a team , getting to play in front of a crowd like this is a great feeling , ' said the world number five , whose brother @entity57 missed media duties as he bids to recover from a minor cold			2
' i would say that 's the nicest thing about the @entity4 , when you get a home tie you get the whole crowd behind you			1
it 's not like that at the tournaments we play throughout the rest of the year			2
' to have a crowd turning up just to support you is fantastic and i 'm sure the whole team will respond			0
' it looks like a great arena , it 's a perfect size and if it 's packed i am sure they will make a lot of noise			0
' it helps in all sports to play in front of a home crowd			0
there can sometimes be a few nerves early because of it but once you get through that it makes a big difference and can help a lot			0
' @entity91 ( seated , left ) and @entity0 take a break and look out to the court during wednesday 's session @entity0 moves towards the net to nip a shot over ahead of facing the @entity11 , who @entity97 beat last year @entity0 checks out the message emblazoned across his top , and later takes a break from the session @entity0 's shirt read : ' good luck @ andy_murray			1
you can do it for the @entity107 ... we believe in you ! # @entity109 ' @entity91 and @entity0 face a tough task to repeat last year 's win over the @entity11 on the arena 's indoor hard court @entity0 joked that @entity91 was ' piling the pressure on ' when his fellow singles player stated that the @entity118 finalist would be a clear favourite in his games , but he later appeared relaxed over the prospect of meeting expectations			1
' i have always viewed nerves as a very positive thing , ' the 27 - year - old said			0
' when you actually learn what nerves are and why they come , it 's positive to feel nervous			0
' i have always felt like i have been able to concentrate better when i have had nerves in the morning or the night before			0
' i feel like my body responds well to it , that i move better and see the ball better			0
it 's just making sure you are able to make the right decisions in those moments			0
i think , well i hope i will deal with it well on friday but who knows ? ' @entity0 shares a laugh with @entity97 's @entity4 team captain @entity141 during the training session @entity0 gave short shrift to questions on the effect his support for @entity7 independence in last year 's referendum would have on his commitment to the @entity97 team , having explained his decision to come out in support a ' yes ' vote in a recent interview			1
' well , i guess we 'll see at the weekend , ' he stated before coach @entity141 moved the topic back to tennis			0
@entity0 helped @entity97 to a 3 - 1 victory over the @entity11 in @entity160 at the same stage last year , before losing to @entity162 in the quarter - finals			1
but the visitors have top singles player @entity165 back after an ankle injury and @entity0 goes into the weekend slightly out of sorts after two quarter - final defeats since his collapse against @entity170 in the @entity172 final			1
@entity0 admitted he had missed the influence of coach @entity174 , who was occupied with @entity176 @entity10 duties when @entity0 lost to @entity177 and then @entity179 teenager @entity178 in @entity180 and @entity181 respectively			1
' i feel i have practised pretty well here , ' he said			0
' i took a couple of days off after @entity181 and got here and started trying to work on a couple of things and get myself back on the right track			0
' after the @entity118 i spent the next three or four weeks with no coach and i feel that 's something i obviously need to get sorted so that when i get to the clay court season i am not in that position , because i feel like there are some things i need to work on all the time and when i do n't have somewhere there it 's harder to do that			2
that 's high on my list of priorities			0
' a press conference followed the training session for @entity0 and his @entity97 team - mates in @entity24			1

@entity0 took part in a training session ahead of @entity4 clash
the @entity31 is expecting a tough task against the @entity11 in @entity24
