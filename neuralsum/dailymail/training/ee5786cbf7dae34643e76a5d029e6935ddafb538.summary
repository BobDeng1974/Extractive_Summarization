' he called her ' the person behind the scenes			0
' protests : @entity2 , right , has repeatedly denied any involvement in her husband 's death @entity26 's lawyer , @entity131 , also asked for a less - than - life sentence , and @entity26 himself told the judge , ' i had nothing to do with this crime			1
i have never done anything wrong			0
' he continued to blame @entity2 's daughter , @entity139 , whose two sons stand to inherit the bulk of the family estate , which included @entity29 's large collection of @entity145 memorabilia			1
