@entity0 , 13 - year - old @entity1 , is one of the youngest children in the @entity3 to be prescribed hormone therapy to help him transition into a male body			1
having lived as a boy since the age of five , @entity1 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , changed his name by deed poll at the age of 11			1
he is now the star of a new documentary about the struggles he has faced living as a transgender child			0
with the aim of educating children about transgender people , ' i am @entity1 ' is being shown on the @entity24 's children 's channel @entity22 at 6pm this evening as part of @entity26			1
treated at the @entity39 and @entity40 , a specialist clinic for young people with gender identity issues , @entity1 is one of very few people under the age of 18 who are receiving hormone treatment for gender dysphoria			1
those suffering from gender dysphoria experience great distress because their biological sex and gender identity are at odds			0
often also known as gender identity disorder ( @entity57 ) it leaves people with the sense they are ' trapped ' in the wrong body			0
@entity1 also receives counselling and therapy at the clinic on what it means to be transgender			0
while many people with @entity57 seek treatment to help them transition to the sex they identify with , @entity1 and his mother @entity30 , 48 , were forced to fight for him to have the hormone therapy due to his young age			1
appearing on @entity76 's @entity75 in september last year , @entity1 said he would ' probably kill myself ' if he had to live as a girl			2
however , despite these intense feelings @entity1 was refused treatment by his gp as it 's effects when started before puberty are as yet unknown and some practitioners feel those under 18 do not have the mental maturity to make such a decision			0
last year @entity1 and his mother appeared on this morning to champion his fight to receive hormone treatment @entity30 , a hairdresser who also has three daughters , rejected the idea that @entity1 should n't have the hormone blockers in case he later regrets his decision			2
she said on @entity75 : ' i think many people think that , maybe i did for some time in the early days but that is n't going to happen , i know that 100 per cent , @entity1 needs the blockers			0
' although @entity1 now has been prescribed the hormone blockers he has still struggled to be accepted as a male and speaks in the documentary about the problems he has faced , particularly at primary school			0
appearing alongside him in ' i am @entity1 ' is @entity103 , who transitioned to live as a man years ago and has spent his life fighting for transgender rights , and 20 year - old @entity107 , who was born male but lives as a young woman			1
