hair salon owner @entity1 , 68 , consumed the shard shortly after sitting down to a steak dinner with her husband @entity14			1
it pierced her carotid artery , causing a massive bleed behind her throat which led to a swelling of the airways and a lack of oxygen to brain			0
an investigation into her death revealed the undamaged jar of mustard which she had taken the condiment from had 29 more pieces of glass concealed in the thick yellow sauce			1
despite a thorough examination of the circumstances surrounding the incident , a coroner today admitted the appearance of glass in the jar was a ' mystery ' before recording a verdict of accidental death			0
mrs @entity1 had planned a night in on march 14 this year , preparing a meal of steak , peas and dumplings for herself and her spouse			1
an inquest heard how , while her @entity14 , her husband of 51 - years had opted for @entity50 mustard , the hairdresser chose the @entity4 version and the jar which was riddled with glass			1
as she ate , mrs @entity1 became ' very unwell very quickly ' the inquest was told			2
@entity14 , dressed all in black , told the hearing in @entity56 , @entity57 : ' she grabbed her throat and said " i ’ve got a piece of glass in my mouth " then she took it out			1
' it was about an inch long and a quarter of an inch thick			1
' the 72 - year - old widower described the fragment as a ' slither ' , adding : ' the last words she said to me were ‘ pat me on the back ’ desperate mrs @entity1 panicked and tried to leave the couple ’s £ 300,000 home in @entity74 , near @entity75 , @entity57			1
but neighbours , including one retired @entity78 police officer laid her down in the hallway while paramedics rushed to the scene			0
recalling the moment , mr @entity82 said : ' by that time she had gone , really			0
' mrs @entity1 was taken to the @entity84 in @entity85 and later transferred to @entity86 , @entity87			2
she died on the afternoon of march 21			0
a subsequent investigation examined mrs @entity1 ’s final meal and the jar of @entity4 mustard she had taken sauce from			1
detective constable @entity93 , of @entity94 , told the inquest : ' the contents of the jar were examined , which revealed fragments of glass			0
' there were some 30 fragments of glass found in the mustard			1
there was no damage to the jar found			0
' no shards of glass were found in the remains of mrs @entity1 ’s dinner			1
a search of glassware in the couple ’s home found no indication of where the fragments could have originated			2
injuries : mrs @entity1 died from her injuries at @entity86 above forensic crime scene investigator @entity119 said : ' the jar had a very old , worn label with a sell - by date of 2011 and appeared to be from @entity123			2
' it is now known where the mustard was bought from as it was not consistent with the labels on the jar			0
mr @entity119 added that there was no evidence of any damage to the jar			0
he could not find any other crockery in the house with damaged glass and added : ' the origin of this chip was not identified and could well have been disposed of by the homeowners between making the contents and consuming			0
' recording a conclusion of accidental death , dr @entity140 said : ' it seems something of a mystery as to exactly where this glass may have come from			0
' addressing mr @entity82 , he said : ' if we look at the evidence very clearly , your meal had no glass in it whatsoever and really the only difference between your two meals was that you had @entity50 mustard and she had @entity4 mustard			1
' we do know there were some 30 shards of glass recovered from that mustard pot. ' while there is no obvious evidence of damage , one must assume that the shards must have come from there			2
' sadly i do n’t think we can take it any further as to where that came from			0
' it is , to my mind , an almost unique occurrence and one that we can not really take any further			0
' he added : ' i do n’t think anyone could have predicted that this could happen and a careful police investigation has failed to find any cause for concern or , indeed , the exact source of the glass			2

@entity1 , 68 , applied the @entity4 mustard to her home - cooked steak
concealed in the sauce was a ' inch thick ' slither of glass
police found *39* more shards in the mustard pot
her husband @entity14 survived after he chose @entity50 mustard
