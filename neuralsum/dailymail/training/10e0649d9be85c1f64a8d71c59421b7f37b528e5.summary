@entity0 has insisted @entity1 still has a significant role to play for the @entity3 despite being dropped for the first time in 13 years			1
the 34 - year - old @entity6 striker headed back to the @entity7 on saturday after being released from the squad a day after being used only as a substitute in @entity3 's 1 - 0 @entity11 qualifier defeat in @entity12			1
it was the first time the @entity14 , who will begin preparations for next sunday 's @entity18 play - offs showdown with @entity19 on his return , has been left out of the team for a competitive match when fit since a clash with @entity24 in 2001			1
@entity1 ( left ) watches on from the bench in @entity26 alongside @entity3 boss @entity27 @entity3 assistant coach @entity0 ( right ) shouts some orders during the tense @entity30 tie @entity1 was brought off the bench with 12 minutes remaining but the veteran striker could not equalise however , assistant manager @entity1 , a former @entity3 team - mate , was adamant that the nation 's record cap - holder and goalscorer remains a key member of @entity27 's squad			1
he said : ' @entity1 is massive for this team , absolutely massive			1
' everyone keeps saying he was disappointed - of course he was			2
tell me any player who is going to be left out of a big game who is not going to be disappointed			2
that 's what you expect from @entity1			1
@entity0 has backed the veteran @entity6 striker to bounce back from his recent disappointment ' but @entity1 is brilliant for the group and brilliant for the team			1
he 's a top , top player , he 's been doing it for years and hopefully he will score goals for the next number of years			2
' but you just pick a team for a certain game , and the way @entity1 reacted to the disappointment to our training session yesterday was fantastic , absolutely different class			2
' @entity1 is as good a professional as i have come across and he will be disappointed , of course			2
but there are other players who were left out			0
" the frontman , who took his tally for his country to 65 goals with a hat - trick against @entity72 last month , had only 12 minutes in which to try to make an impression as he won his 138th cap at @entity76 , and his frustration was clear afterwards			1
he told reporters he needed to play as part of an attacking partnership and that he was not suited to a lone striking role , admitting he was ' no @entity82 ' , the towering striker whose previous @entity84 record of 21 goals he passed a decade ago			2
@entity1 shakes hands with @entity12 manager @entity87 at the final whistle asked about that statement , @entity0 , who also played alongside @entity82 and later accepted his offer of employment as @entity94 manager , said simply : ' he 's a lot better than @entity82			1
' as the younger man headed back across the @entity103 , the rest of the squad - barring midfielder @entity97 , who has returned to club @entity99 for treatment on a minor knee injury - were licking their wounds and starting to turn their attention to tuesday night 's friendly against the @entity7 in @entity14			2
@entity3 were ultimately undone by a fine @entity109 finish in @entity26 , which condemned them to their first @entity30 defeat and left them locked in a three - way battle with the @entity113 and world champions @entity115 for second place behind leaders @entity118			1
they have been criticised for their direct approach against @entity87 's men , which failed to yield the number of opportunities for which they might have hoped in front of goal			0
but while there was disappointment within the camp , @entity27 's number two was adopting a bullish approach to the recovery process			0
@entity0 said : ' i did n't expect us to go through the whole campaign unbeaten , there were always going to be some points dropped			0
but we have to take our medicine , we have to take the criticism that 's coming our way and bounce back			0
the 34 - year - old striker , who has scored 65 goals for his country , won his 138th cap at @entity76 ' it 's very , very tight , absolutely			1
there 's not much between a lot of the teams			0
on paper @entity115 , you would still think , would be the favourites , but between @entity118 , ourselves and @entity12 , i think it 's going to be very , very tight			1
' four of the @entity3 's next five qualifiers will take place at the @entity156 and their form there is likely to go a long way towards deciding where they finish in the group			1
but as he and @entity27 prepared to bring an end to their 2014 fixtures less than a fortnight after celebrating a year in post , the assistant boss was happy enough with his lot			0
he said : ' there have been no real surprises			0
you are always learning about the group , even the other night , lots round about the group			0
but no real shocks or surprises			0
' we have good teams coming to the @entity156 , but with the home support and the lads will be licking their wounds for the next month or two , we will look to bounce back			0
that is what sport is all about , bouncing back , and we have got some good lads			0
' they were hurting pretty badly the other night , we know they were			0
if you think for one minute they are not hurt by the other night , then you do n't know the group			0

it was the first time @entity1 had been left out of the @entity84 team for a competitive match when fit since a clash with @entity24 in 2001
@entity1 featured for the last 12 minutes of his side 's 1 - 0 loss to @entity12 at @entity76
the @entity6 striker won his 138th cap in @entity26
@entity3 are now locked in a three - way battle for second place with @entity12 and @entity115 behind surprise leaders @entity118 in @entity30
