it once seemed as though the stories at @entity2 and @entity3 were twinned			1
under the respective regimes of @entity6 and @entity7 , both clubs endured high - profile turmoil			1
both amassed substantial debts and both plunged into administration			1
it was then , however , that the tales diverged			1
regardless of the on - field outcome on saturday , you have to think @entity2 fans are looking eastwards with a sense of envy			1
rangers remain in turmoil , despite @entity24 's consortium 's asset purchase at @entity25 two years and five months after @entity24 ’s consortium completed an asset purchase at @entity25 , this institution of @entity28 sport remains mired in discord			1
trust between the fanbase and those in charge is somewhere between scant and non-existent			1
league attendances have dipped below 30,000			1
redundancies have taken place within administrative staff			1
the financial situation is perilous			1
@entity41 has provided a loan to assume effective control , but @entity2 have admitted more money will be needed before the end of the year			1
no one has yet spelled out a longer - term vision for the future			1
added to that , the team is currently six points adrift of a @entity3 side assembled on a significantly smaller budget			1
that view from the summit of the @entity56 is not the only thing for @entity59 season - ticket holders to enjoy right now			1
@entity60 owner @entity41 has provided a loan to @entity2 thanks to the financial backing of businesswoman @entity65 , the club emerged from administration with a credible strategy for fan ownership			2
@entity70 ’s intentions are clear			2
to fund a @entity72 for the @entity73 , she stumped up £ 2.5million which will be paid back through the on - going contributions of rank - and - file supporters			2
@entity70 intends to fill the role of chairperson for between three and five years , by which point it is hoped £ 6m will have been raised and the club will be in full fan ownership			2
that precious commodity of trust seems in fulsome supply around @entity84			2
supporters have reacted positively to further moves from the new regime , such as introducing a living wage for all staff			2
a museum within @entity59 has also been mooted			1
there has been a re-connection between those in the stands , those in the boardroom and those in the changing room			2
the contrast with @entity2 is profound			2
clearly , the very different ways in which the clubs handled administration set their future patterns			2
@entity104 , formerly of @entity105 , was a community ownership middle man between the previous @entity107 owners at @entity59 and @entity73			1
like many , he sees a great opportunity lost where @entity2 are concerned			2
the financial situation at @entity25 is perilous and the team are six points adrift of @entity56 leaders @entity3 ‘ from the start of the process at @entity2 and the start of the process at @entity3 , the similarities were there , ’ he said			1
‘ the biggest difference was the appointment of the administrators			2
‘ @entity3 brought in @entity122 , who knows and understands community ownership and was involved with @entity124 , @entity3 and @entity125			1
he believes it is more than the numbers that matter at a club			0
‘ it ’s also about the heart and soul of the club , which rests in the community			0
‘ the sad thing for @entity2 was that they had a far bigger community than @entity3 and did n’t tap into it			1
that came down to the administrator			0
‘ part of the administrator ’s duty is to make sure that when he leaves that business it has a long - term strategy to survive			0
@entity145 has got off to a storming start after taking over at @entity59 ‘ did that happen at @entity2 after @entity148 left ? the answer is no. there was not a succinct , rock - solid business plan that would make the future secure			1
‘ had the @entity2 fans galvanised and got together at that time then , with an administrator like @entity122 , that could have happened			0
‘ @entity122 took a more holistic approach to the welfare of @entity3			1
he had other bids that were higher , but did n’t want to take the risk			0
@entity160 of @entity3 demonstrated , via their 8,500 supporters , that there was an ongoing willingness to work with business people hand in hand			1
that is the perfect marrying of models			0
’ the clear - eyed planning has extended beyond finance			0
on her first day of control , @entity70 authorised a ruthless series of cuts to the playing and coaching staff			0
it was brutal and unquestionably painful for some of those involved			0
but it made for a clean break			0
appointing @entity180 as director of football and @entity145 as head coach has delivered swift dividends			0
the partnership between director of football @entity180 and head coach @entity145 has worked well it ’s still too early in the season for definite predictions of success , but the signings made have improved and galvanised an existing core of talented youngsters			0
@entity145 has taken a first senior coaching role in his stride , often delivering vibrant football			0
@entity180 is on hand to provide shrewd counsel			0
‘ your driving model has to be the sustainability of the club , ’ added @entity104			0
‘ what @entity2 has never had since 2012 is a sustainable business model			0
‘ they were signing players on £ 7,000 a week and it was insanity			0
there was no need to spend what they did coming up through the leagues			0
they have frittered away vast sums of fans ’ money			0
‘ then there is the money used by the various owners for their own ends to the detriment of the club			0
‘ this is where @entity3 have got it absolutely spot - on			1
they will not be spending more money than they bring in			0
‘ it ’s basic , but the added investment in the club is coming purely from contributions from the 8,500 fans who see where their money goes			0
‘ they know what it is providing when their direct debit goes in on the 20th of the month			0

rangers are in turmoil , despite *takeover* by @entity24 's consortium
@entity245 's men also trail @entity56 leaders @entity3 by six points
