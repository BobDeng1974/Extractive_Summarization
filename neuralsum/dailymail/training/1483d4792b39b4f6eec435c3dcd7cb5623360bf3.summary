@entity2 's @entity1 coach and mentor rang @entity5 's rising star after the against - the - odds victory over @entity7 in @entity8 to congratulate him on a try - scoring display that captured the nation 's attention			1
six years after having his breath taken away by the speed of the 14 - year - old @entity2 's footwork , @entity12 was not surprised by his young charge 's response			1
' i phoned him after the game in @entity7 just to say , ' well done on an unbelievable performance and your first try ' , and @entity23 replied , ' yes , but i dropped one , did n't i ? ' he 's always been like that , constantly striving for perfection			1
' @entity2 gets into the thick of the action during @entity5 's training session in @entity28 on thursday @entity2 fires out a pass at @entity5 's base in @entity31 as @entity5 full back @entity32 watches on @entity2 as a child with his mother @entity34 and father @entity35 , who played flanker for @entity37 @entity2 's performance , on only his fifth @entity5 appearance , in front of 78,000 fans and more than eight million watching on tv , was so assured it was hard to believe that here was a young man who sat his a-levels only two years ago			1
' i remember the first time i saw him he was about 14 , a tall but real skinny kid , ' said @entity12 , who first coached @entity2 at @entity52 's academy before convincing him to follow him down the @entity53 to @entity1 in his late teens			1
' his older brother @entity55 was down for an academy session and @entity23 came with him			0
we did some footwork drills with the top 17 and 18 - year - olds in the group			1
@entity23 left everybody for dead			0
i 'd never seen anything like it before at that age			0
' we had him down the next week and it 's gone from there			2
first impressions of him were of a young man with unbelievable footwork and unbelievable ability			0
nothing 's changed in that regard : @entity23 could step you in a phone box			2
he 's a special talent			2
' @entity12 coached @entity2 ( above ) at @entity52 's academy before convincing him to join him at @entity1 that footwork , allied to searing pace and a superb defensive work - rate , have seen @entity2 fast - tracked into @entity84 's squad after impressing all the way through @entity5 's age - group levels			1
a hugely gifted young sportsman who had trials for @entity92 as a 13 - year - old and also excelled at @entity95 's @entity94 in cricket and hockey , @entity2 — who also has three a-levels at grades @entity89 — was inspired as a youngster by @entity5 's 2003 @entity101 - winning wing @entity99			1
' when i was playing at under 9 or 10 level , i was watching @entity99 a lot and trying to emulate him , ' he said			1
' i just tried to be like him as a kid and i 've followed it up from there			0
' being the middle brother of three , @entity2 was driven by a fierce sibling rivalry which saw him constantly striving to better @entity55 , now an @entity111 star , while his younger brother @entity112 , in his final year at @entity95 's , tried to keep pace			1
@entity2 showed world class finishing skills to gather @entity32 's chip to touch down against @entity7 ' all the boys played rugby on a saturday and football on a sunday , ' said his dad @entity35 , himself a former @entity37 flanker whose career was ended by a ruptured knee ligament			1
' i think that 's helped them tremendously with being able to kick a ball			2
they all made a decision to focus on rugby when they were 12 or 13			2
' they 'd run around in the garden all the time			0
@entity55 would go out in the garden and kick a ball and @entity2 would join them			1
@entity112 would be running around with his little feet trying to catch them but failing			0
even from a very young age people would say @entity2 could go all the way			1
' now 6ft 1in and weighing more than 15st , @entity2 has all the gifts to be a top - class international full back — where he normally plays for @entity1 — or wing			1
a @entity145 finalist with @entity95 's , his talent was evident from a young age			2
' he always had beautiful footwork , ' said @entity148 , @entity95 's head of sport			2
' he was n't the biggest at junior school but he was certainly part of a strong year			2
the under 9s won the national title in 2003 , the year @entity5 won the @entity101			1
' he was very jinky and would dance his way up the field			0
his ability to beat players was outstanding			0
he would do stuff that was different and would n't conform to being the textbook rugby player			0
you did n't want to over- coach him or suppress that free spirit			0
' @entity2 ( right ) beats @entity7 winger @entity164 to a high ball at the @entity166 @entity2 's lavish talents came to the attention of @entity169 when he broke into the @entity5 schools set - up when the now national coach was running the @entity173 academy programme			1
' if you watch him in training , his ability to understand the defensive system and make good decisions , whether to come up and make the tackle or to back off when he 's outnumbered , is very impressive , ' @entity84 said			2
' his aerial skills are exceptional			0
two or three times at the weekend it was a 50 - 50 and he came up with the ball every time			0
he 's big , tall , athletic and obviously we 've not really put him in too much space in the games and that 's his point of difference			0
' i think he could be exceptional for us			0
' in many ways @entity2 already has been exceptional			1
the way he scooped up @entity32 's clever grubber kick down the right - hand touchline against @entity7 on friday to kick - start @entity5 's revival bore the hallmarks of a world - class finisher			1
this week @entity1 's head coach @entity199 , who first saw @entity2 's enormous potential playing alongside his son — current @entity5 fly - half @entity203 — for @entity5 schools four years ago , highlighted the 20 - year - old 's much - improved temperament following his work with sports psychologist @entity208			1
@entity2 crosses for a try against @entity210 during @entity1 's 31 - 14 win against the @entity212 in december ' @entity2 has learnt a lot from @entity208 , ' @entity199 said			1
' @entity2 's loving it			1
he said if he had played in this fixture last year he 'd have been a nervous wreck , but on friday he was full of confidence			0
he 's got a great unpredictability about him , which is great to coach			0
' i ca n't exaggerate how beneficial that has been , ' he said			0
' i think a lot of people neglect the mental side of rugby but i think it 's paramount in allowing us to go out on the pitch on the saturday and allowing us to perform			2
' a year ago i would have been massively nervous going to the @entity166 in that hostile environment and having to play			1
this time i struck that perfect balance between being calm and excited			0
' i was confident that i 'd done all the work required and i was ready to perform			0
as a player , i do n't want to stagnate			0
i always want to get better			0
' on saturday , at @entity233 , @entity2 will be striving for perfection again .			2
