@entity0 has reportedly rubbished claims that he is nearing the end of his career after labelling @entity4 a ' fool ' for questioning his age			1
the 33 - year - old was rumoured to have fallen out with @entity4 after the @entity10 boss was filmed by a @entity12 television channel saying , ' @entity7 is 32 years old , maybe 35 , who knows ? ' although @entity0 seemed to laugh off the comment with a comical ' old man ' celebration after scoring against @entity18 in january , it would seem the @entity19 still has an issue with the @entity22 boss			1
and it is not because a fool called me an old man that you must believe it			0
' and you may have noticed that the old man was better than the youngsters			0
' @entity0 , now out of contract after a season with the @entity44 , also hinted that he will play for a @entity47 club next season rather than sign a lucrative deal in the @entity49			1
he added : ‘ some believe i am going to retire in the @entity51 or in the @entity49 , but i have regained the joy of the @entity53 and i am going to carry on playing in the @entity53			0
in doubt : @entity10 boss @entity4 was filmed questioning @entity0 's age on the move : the decorated striker is now out of contract at @entity10 and looks to be heading elsewhere ' where ? i am not going to tell you			1
but i am going to carry on playing because physically and mentally i feel great			0
' so i am going to go to this @entity62 and to the next one when i will be 37			0
' some did it at 42 , so i can still play in two more @entity64			2
’ @entity0 was rumoured to be one of the players that @entity4 tore into during half - time of @entity10 's 0 - 0 @entity69 draw with @entity70			1
the former @entity72 and @entity73 striker had n't even played the first half and was named on the bench for the game , but was allegedly still subject to @entity4 's venom			2
veteran : @entity0 will take part in his fourth @entity62 with @entity80 in @entity81 this summer			0

@entity10 manager @entity4 said @entity0 was ' 32 years old , maybe 35 '
@entity0 *maintains* ' the old man was better than all the youngsters '
