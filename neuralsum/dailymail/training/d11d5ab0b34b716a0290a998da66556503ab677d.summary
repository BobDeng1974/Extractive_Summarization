nothing is more certain in this season of twists and turns , shocks and surprises than that @entity6 will go all out to beat @entity7 on sunday rather than play for the home draw which would deliver unto them , for the second time in three years , the @entity11 title			1
@entity13 ’s effervescent team go into the last day fined a fortune for breaking financial fair play regulations and under fire for occupying the top position in the table for no more than a couple of weekends since august			0
so the question is : do they deserve the championship of @entity24 ? going all the way to the top : @entity6 are destined to end their goal - laden season with the title let ’s see if those aristocratic neighbours at @entity32 can give us an honest answer			1
i suspect they will , if the question is put in its proper context			0
being knocked off their perch was always going to be painful for @entity41			1
that @entity6 , again , should profit from that fall from grace makes it torture			2
but nothing will injure the red faithful more than the manner in which they have lost and @entity6 have won the title			1
the agonising truth is that @entity6 that have claimed the crown by playing the thrill - factor football with which sir @entity55 ’s swashbuckling @entity41 teams used to exercise their swaggering domination over our national game			1
that this should happen at the same time as @entity41 were retreating into the cautious , defensive shell constructed by @entity55 ’s chosen replacement makes it all the more unbearable for them			1
@entity63 is not the first to be overwhelmed by the romantic expectations at @entity32			2
it was n’t easy to follow sir @entity66 , either			0
it does not make him a bad manager but he was the bringer of a sad reality			0
losing to @entity6 is one thing			2
being out - thrilled by them is something more chastening altogether and if their hands were not so heavily on heart @entity41 ’s fans should be applauding their cross-town rivals			2
never mind being 20 points behind in a race they won by 11 last may , feel the hurt of the goal difference			1
city are plus 63 , having scored a hundred			0
@entity41 are 42 back , having netted a mere 63 times			2
@entity89 , even while going for goal the @entity87 boys are still the better defenders			0
i am not a believer that statistics tell the whole story but there is no getting round these numbers			0
less so when you watch @entity6 play			2
@entity13 always believe his expensive – in the eyes of @entity100 over-expensive – ensemble will outscore the opposition			0
@entity63 , trapped in his pressurised bunker , barely trusted the heirs to the @entity55 legacy to cross the half - way			0
thrill factor : @entity110 's goal against @entity111 typifies @entity6 's effervescence this season belief : @entity13 ( centre ) always backs his expensively - assembled side to outscore the opposition swashbuckling : sir @entity55 's teams used to win trophies with style not everyone approves of @entity122 owners pouring their oil wealth into a @entity125 suburb			1
but at a time when @entity41 were flagging as the standard bearers , there can be no logical denying that the @entity11 needed a team to step up and entertain the masses			1
it rubs salt into the @entity32 wound that @entity133 have been the next best to @entity6 when it came to meeting that challenge and all credit to @entity137 for stimulating that revival on the @entity139			1
but while a @entity142 championship would have provided the emotional climax to this @entity144 anniversary year , it is @entity6 ’s football which has roused the blood of football lovers everywhere			2
one glance at the mediocrity below the elite clubs serves as a reminder of the importance of @entity6 ’s contribution to the spectacle			1
@entity155 go into this last weekend on a paltry 36 points			0
four more clubs just above them – @entity159 , @entity111 , @entity160 and @entity161 – all have less than the 40 points which used to be the cut line			2
wretchedly as @entity41 are struggling home in seventh , the rest are at least eight points in arrears of them			1
@entity6 , with some help from @entity133 , have diverted attention from that erosion of standards from the bottom of league , let alone being over-priced , is over-hyped as allegedly the best in the world			2
even for @entity41 fans , it is time to own up and give @entity6 the respect they deserve			1
style council : this @entity184 volley exemplified the verve with which @entity55 's teams played is that it , mr @entity189 ? is this really all the new @entity193 chairman ’s master plan for breeding generations of @entity24 world beaters ? this is the half - baked mish - mash just dished up for the future of our game : a few b teams from the @entity11 giants playing down in a nether - world somewhere between @entity203 and the @entity204 , some of whose clubs will make up the numbers			1
the likes of @entity133 , @entity41 , @entity210 and @entity6 fostering nursery clubs lower down those divisions			1
a trimming of imports so that 90 home - grown footballers play half any club ’s @entity11 games in a season , instead of 66 at present			0
one in the eye for common sense : @entity189 's @entity224 report is hardly revolutionary how , exactly , is playing in a new @entity225 against part - timers and fellow reserves going to prepare the finest @entity24 youngsters to take on @entity229 , @entity230 et al in @entity231 2014 ? nor will they be allowed promotion above @entity235 if it is to work , as it does in @entity237 , the b teams must compete in the @entity238 – and , by the way , not be forbidden to take part in the @entity241			1
nursery clubs ? most of the big teams already have them , de facto , in the more challenging and educational first divisions on the continent			2
an increase of 24 more home boys getting a few more games in the @entity11 ? wow			0
i ’m not great at maths but unless i ’m mistaken that adds down to all of 1.2 players per each of the 20 clubs			2
you had to worry about this commission when you saw who the chairman is			0
now @entity189 has discovered first hand who really runs the national game			1
it ’s not his @entity193			0
it ’s the big clubs			1
of course @entity268 is coming to @entity41 once @entity272 ’s @entity271 campaign in @entity230 is over			1
whether he is the right man for the job remains to be seen			0
by his own admission he is an iron - fisted tyrant			0
by our observation his teams play with flair and style when things go well but he can revert to the suffocatingly pragmatic if the going gets tough			0
but one thing he must not do is allow to fall into rusting neglect the pipe - line through which @entity41 have always brought fine young players and continue to do so			1
the future 's bright : @entity289 scores against @entity159 and @entity41 must remember their traditions and nurture him , @entity291 ( below left ) and @entity293 ( below right ) @entity289 , 18 , scored twice in this week ’s 3 - 1 win over @entity159 as he led an attack which included 19 - year - old @entity293 and @entity291 , 20			1
@entity299 and @entity300 , as stand - in manager and temporary coach respectively , are still at @entity32 as reminders of how well this youth policy has served the club down the years			0
thus have @entity41 have helped not only themselves but @entity24 , and other nations			0
that trust is about to be place in @entity309 ’s hands			0
let him not betray it			0
a quiet word in the quivering ears of @entity314 , @entity315 and @entity316 , among others , before we drown in their tears			1
football is supposed to be a man ’s game and never forget it is only a game			0
not the crying game .			0

@entity6 will go for the win against @entity7 on sunday to clinch the title
as their neighbours have *excelled* , @entity41 have retreated into their shells
the goal difference will hurt @entity41 more than the points difference
it is time for everyone to give @entity6 the respect they deserve
@entity189 's @entity193 do *n't* run the national game , the big clubs do
@entity268 must give young players a chance at @entity32
*dry* your eyes @entity316 , @entity348 and @entity315
