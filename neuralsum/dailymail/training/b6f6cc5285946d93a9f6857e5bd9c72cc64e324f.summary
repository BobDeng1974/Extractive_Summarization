by @entity0 @entity1 has played a lot of alpha males			1
he 's been @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , and @entity11			2
and he 's currently filming the second series of the acclaimed @entity15 drama @entity13 , in which he 's one of the most alpha of them all , dr @entity20 , the driven scientist whose 1950s research into how the body responds to stimulation sparked the sexual revolution and who has been credited with ' teaching @entity15 how to love '			1
@entity1 takes part in the @entity28 match in aid of children 's charity @entity30 @entity32 tomorrow in person , @entity1 's a man of incredible intensity too – though one who can be uproariously funny			1
he is fiercely focused on the things that are important to him			2
it 's easy to understand , then , why he had it written into his @entity13 contract that he needed a week off to play football			1
he 's team captain in a televised , celebrity - studded @entity28 match in aid of children 's charity @entity44 , and when he plays at @entity47 tomorrow his childhood dreams will be reignited			1
@entity1 , 45 , grew up in @entity48 , @entity49 , the birthplace of @entity50 and @entity51 , which he says is a ' good breeding ground for actors , maybe because there 's absolutely nothing to do '			1
as @entity56 in @entity57 ! ( 2006 ) @entity4 in @entity5 ( 2008 ) soccer manager @entity6 in @entity7 ( 2009 ) @entity8 in @entity11 ( 2010 ) @entity13 ( 2013 ) but his first ticket out of there was actually from @entity61 , who offered a teenage @entity1 a youth team place			1
' up until i was 13 i was obsessed with football , ' he says , ' but going to @entity61 would have meant living in @entity67 and @entity68 said i was too young and i had to wait till i was 16			2
but by the time i was 16 i had become obsessed with acting			2
' @entity71 still excites him , though , and he 's passionate about raising money for @entity30 and doing it in a way he loves			1
' @entity47 is going to be the scene of one of the greatest football matches of all time , ' he smiles			2
@entity80 came up with the idea of @entity28 eight years ago and tomorrow he 's @entity82 's assistant manager and captain , with players including actor @entity85 , pop stars @entity86 and @entity88 , and comedian @entity89			1
@entity1 , who plays in defence , is captain of the @entity91			1
' whenever i go anywhere in the world and talk about @entity28 i always say , " and i am your captain , " ' he chortles quietly			1
' this will be my third @entity28			1
' his team – coached by @entity99 manager @entity98 – includes @entity101 actor @entity100 , @entity102 , who appeared in @entity103 and @entity104 , chef @entity105 and @entity107 comedian @entity106			2
football legends also playing include @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			2
@entity1 was born in @entity112 , @entity113 , but moved to @entity114 aged five , and then back to @entity48 three years later with his father @entity115 , who now works as a @entity117 lookalike , and mother @entity118 , who writes poetry			1
it was tough for him to suddenly find himself in a school where everyone knew each other and he was the outsider			2
he had to be good at football to be accepted			2
' @entity71 stopped me being picked on , ' he says			2
but then , after the drama teacher at his comprehensive school had put him up for classes at his local youth theatre , he was set on a new path			2
' @entity132 became something that was a great guide through life , through the world			0
' it 's certainly taken him all over the planet but acting is n't the reason he lives in @entity141			0
he 's there because he wanted to be close to his daughter @entity143 , 15			0
her mother is the actress @entity144 , and though they split up in 2003 , they remain devoted parents			0
perhaps because he got tired of people questioning him about his ex , who 's since married director @entity151 , @entity1 has become extremely private			1
i ask him if anyone ever comes up to him in the street to ask him for advice , a la dr masters , on their sex lives ? ' no , because the character is quite formidable			0
people are a bit worried about coming up and asking me stuff			0
i think i tend to scare them off			0
' are he and the character similar ? ' when you 're playing a character for a long time , you invariably find connections			0
you do start to mould yourself into the person			0
so yes , there are a lot of similarities			0
' he is , however , relaxed talking about two things – @entity143 and football – saying he only took a part in the @entity178 ( as vampire @entity179 ) so his daughter could be enthusiastic about a film he 'd been @entity183 , though , is clearly still a pure joy , not just the playing of it , but with @entity28 and @entity30			1
' last year i went to see the work they 're doing in @entity188 in @entity189 , and @entity190 , to see how the money we raised in the last @entity28 was being spent			1
' he describes seeing malnourished infants close to death being given life - saving treatment			0
@entity1 with @entity80 at @entity28 2012 ' you see them hours away from dying and then leaving healthy			1
it makes you want to do the best you can			0
' i remember sitting in a @entity30 camp opposite a girl the same age as my daughter			1
this girl 's name is @entity207			0
through an interpreter i said , " that 's a beautiful name			0
i have a daughter and her name is a flower too			0
" she told me about her life and i realised just how different @entity143 and @entity207 are			0
it made a very real , direct connection			0
i could n't help but see my daughter in her position and vice versa			0
' @entity1 's spent the past week training for his big match after jetting in from @entity141			1
' exercise and running around the training pitch is the best way of getting over jet lag			1
i do n't do a lot of sport these days but i try to keep as fit as i can as i know how unbelievably exhausting playing a match is , and what a strain it puts on a boy in his mid-forties			0
' this year it 's going to be different			0
it 's not just about fulfilling my dreams , i actually have a direct experience now of what the money that 's raised can do to help people			0
and it 's still going to be amazing to walk out in front of 70,000 people at @entity47 – there really is no feeling like it			0
' @entity245 , tomorrow , 6pm , @entity246			1
for tickets or to donate to @entity30 visit @entity248			1
public donations will be matched by the @entity250 .			0

@entity1 will give @entity13 a rest this week as he turns to the pitch
he is taking part in @entity28 in support of @entity30
catch it tomorrow from 6pm on @entity246
