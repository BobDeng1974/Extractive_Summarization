scroll down to see @entity19 in action @entity19 the space robot has already been tested on a series of zero gravity flights , and will blast off to the @entity12 later this year @entity19 will also visit schools and help educate children about space - and is seen here dancing with a group of children before his flight @entity19 will also keep the rest of the crew amused , take pictures and update his @entity35 account via a robot brother back on @entity38 as part of his mission to be a ‘ social robot ’			1
in an oh - so - cute - it - hurts video posted on @entity43 , @entity19 is put through a zero gravity test in which he floats through the air with his arms and legs waving around			1
he also waves and appears at one point to do a little dance			0
another video shows him playing with schoolchildren who smile and copy him as he bends over and flaps his arms			2
@entity19 is the work of the @entity58 and his @entity16 maker @entity59 after an appeal by the @entity61			1
