his actions have touched many across the world and revitalised the @entity4 but for @entity8 , comforting this stricken man after today 's weekly audience in @entity7 was another simple act of compassion			1
in scenes strikingly similar to his encounter with the disfigured @entity14 two weeks before , the pontiff first spoke with the worshipper and then put his arms around him , blessing him			1
the man 's identity is not known , nor are the details of what caused such terrible damage to his face			1
pope @entity8 may have been sneaking out of the @entity23 at night to give money to the poor on the streets of @entity27			1
here he is pictured after his weekly @entity29 audience in @entity7 blessing a severely disfigured man together in prayer : the @entity8 and the disabled man shared a private moment where @entity8 gestured up to the sky personal connection : pope @entity8 leant in to hug and kiss the man and give him his blessing at the end of his audience in the @entity23 today however , his delight at spending a few moments in the presence of the leader of the @entity4 can be imagined			1

bringer of joy : pope @entity8 has made a habit of dedicating time to greet and bless sick or disabled people at the end of the general audience the @entity8 , once again in @entity7 for his general audience , put his hands on the 53 - year - old @entity68 man , kissed , hugged and prayed with him			1
speaking earlier this week , mr @entity14 said the pontiff 's hug was ' like paradise ' , adding : ' he did n't even think about whether or not to hug me			1
' i 'm not contagious , but he did n't know that			2
but he just did it : he caressed me all over my face , and as he did i felt only love			2
' mr @entity14 recollected : ' he came down from the altar to see the sick people			2
he embraced me without saying a word			2
i felt as though my heart was leaving my body			0
' he was completely silent but sometimes you can say more when you say nothing			0
' ' first , i kissed his hand while with the other hand he caressed my head and wounds			0
then he drew me to him in a strong embrace , kissing my face			0
act of kindness : @entity8 ( left ) comforted @entity14 , a 52 - year - old @entity68 who had travelled to @entity27 for a audience in @entity7 in november painful : @entity14 with a picture of his late mother @entity94 , who suffered from the same condition he does this weekend the @entity8 offered ' boxes of mercy ' to pilgrims in st peter 's square			1
some 20,000 boxes , designed to look like a packet of painkillers , were illustrated with a human heart and contained a rosary			0
addressing the crowd in @entity7 the @entity105 said : ' i now want to suggest a medicine			0
" what " you ask , " the pope is now a pharmacist ? " ' the instruction leaflet , available in several languages read : ' can be used once a day , but in case of emergency can be taken as much as the soul needs			1
' my head was against his chest his arms were wrapped around me			0
it lasted just over a minute , but to me it seemed like an eternity			0
' earlier this year , @entity8 tweeted to his 3.2million followers : ’ the @entity8 must serve all people , especially the poor , the weak , the vulnerable			1
’ the so - called ' pope @entity125 ' has been credited with a 20 per cent rise in @entity4 congregations in @entity129 , and similar boosts around the world			2
