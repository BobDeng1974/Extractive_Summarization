by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 29 december 2012 updated : 15:42 est , 31 december 2012 grasping her mother ’s hand tightly as she waited to go into yet another hospital appointment , it dawned on opera star @entity6 how alien the situation felt			1
of course , the clinical white walls and smell of disinfectant were unfamiliar but it was the role she was playing that suddenly struck her as so very odd			2
‘ my mum has always been my rock , the first person i could turn to when i felt wobbly or vulnerable , ’ says @entity6 , 24			1
‘ now i was the one reassuring and providing support , while at the same time being quite terrified myself			2
’ @entity6 ’s feelings were entirely justified because this was n’t a routine check - up			1
it was one of innumerable visits her mother had to make to the @entity24 , @entity25 , to monitor the cancer in her right breast			1
supporting act : @entity6 helped her mother @entity29 through breast cancer @entity29 , 51 , a psychotherapist , was diagnosed in june last year			1
it has been a difficult time but @entity6 , her partner – @entity33 rugby player @entity32 – and her family believe they have come out of the ordeal closer and stronger			1
when @entity29 was first given the devastating news , @entity6 ’s diary was crammed with tours , dates and public events			1
she had just completed a whirlwind 18 months in which she ’d been nominated for a classical @entity43 , sang for the @entity44 , had a bestselling debut album and performed at @entity46 and @entity47 in front of thousands			2
forthcoming appearances were due to earn her more than £ 250,000 , fulfilling her dream of becoming a major music star			1
‘ it was a simple choice – i just dropped everything , ’ says @entity6			1
‘ my agent said i was mad			2
we were supposed to be finalising a date i ’d been asked to do , performing at the crown prince of @entity59 ’s wedding , and there was an insane amount of money at stake			2
‘ but my priority was @entity65			2
i want to be successful , but what is fame and money if you do n’t have the people you love most in the world ? ’ singing for strength : before her mother 's diagnosis , @entity6 , seen singing at @entity46 , was set to make a quarter of a million pounds in planned performances , but she gave it all up indeed @entity6 , who shot to fame three years ago after being discovered by @entity77 ’s @entity78 , and her mother are incredibly close			1
the singer , who suffered with severe stage fright , credits @entity29 for getting her into the spotlight at the beginning of her career after giving her hypnosis			1
‘ people ask me if i am proud of my daughter because of what she has achieved in the music business but what makes me really proud is what a lovely girl she is , ’ says @entity29			1
‘ all she has ever wanted is a singing career and she was happy to throw it all away for me			2
i told her not to , her father told her not to but she refused to listen			2
’ the mother and daughter are speaking just before @entity6 performs in front of a small , exclusive audience at the @entity101 by @entity102 overlooking @entity25 ’s @entity103			1
it is the second time she has performed here – she turned on their @entity108 lights earlier this month – and both times , all money raised has gone to breast cancer charities			1
looking back at the diagnosis , @entity6 could see that her mother ’s health had deteriorated but did not think it was anything serious			1
‘ she had felt tired for the past year , but being fully immersed in her career we all thought she just needed a holiday			2
there was no history of breast cancer in the family – she had n’t developed any lumps – so it never occurred to any of us , least of all her			1
’ team work : @entity6 says the support from her partner , @entity33 and @entity127 rugby captain @entity32 helped her through the tough times @entity29 , 51 , a psychotherapist , was diagnosed in june last year			1
it has been a difficult time but @entity6 , her partner – @entity33 rugby player @entity32 – and her family believe they have come out of the ordeal closer and stronger			1
when @entity29 was first given the devastating news , @entity6 ’s diary was crammed with tours , dates and public events			1
she had just completed a whirlwind 18 months in which she ’d been nominated for a classical @entity43 , sang for the @entity44 , had a bestselling debut album and performed at @entity46 and @entity47 in front of thousands			2
forthcoming appearances were due to earn her more than £ 250,000 , fulfilling her dream of becoming a major music star			1
‘ it was a simple choice – i just dropped everything , ’ says @entity6			1
‘ my agent said i was mad			2
we were supposed to be finalising a date i ’d been asked to do , performing at the crown prince of @entity59 ’s wedding , and there was an insane amount of money at stake			0
‘ but my priority was @entity65			0
i want to be successful , but what is fame and money if you do n’t have the people you love most in the world ? ’ ‘ i had to help in any way i could			0
it ’s not just about going to the doctor ’s , it ’s about being there , helping , lifting spirits			0
there are just three of us in my family and we ’ve helped each other through tough times			0
‘ being so ill meant @entity65 could n’t work			0
my dad works in @entity173 and it was really important that he kept his job			0
i do what i do because my parents have always supported me			0
i just felt this was going to be the most important thing i could do			0
’ perhaps one unexpected positive to have come out of the dreadful experience , says @entity6 , is that it brought her closer to @entity32 , 26			1
‘ family is hugely important to him – he lost his dad to a heart attack when he was five and he is extremely close to his mum			0
i ’d spend every day with my mum and then when @entity191 returned from work i ’d go home to @entity32			0
he picked me up off the floor so many times			0
’ in october 2011 , @entity29 had a full mastectomy and reconstruction of the right breast			1
it took nine hours to remove and rebuild the area using tissue taken from her stomach			0
‘ that was awful , ’ says @entity6			1
‘ before that , i think everything had seemed unreal			0
but suddenly , it was really happening			0
‘ @entity191 and i waved goodbye to mum as she was wheeled through the doors into theatre			0
as they swung shut , i broke down			0
i thought that might be it			0
i ca n’t think of that moment now without crying			0
’ the operation was successful , although there were minor complications with the reconstruction that required a follow - up procedure this february			0
and because the cancer had not spread to the lymph nodes , @entity29 did not require additional therapy to treat the condition			1
‘ last @entity108 was difficult because , although it was confirmed that the cancer was contained and that she would not require chemotherapy , @entity65 was still in an awful lot of pain , ’ says @entity6			1
‘ she just did n’t look like her usual strong self			0
’ but 12 months on , there is now every reason to celebrate what the @entity229 has to offer			0
@entity29 was given the all - clear in july and now feels almost entirely back to her normal self			1
‘ i was incredibly lucky that my cancer treatment and recovery have been relatively straightforward , ’ she says			2
‘ i have discovered a strength i never knew i had and i have n’t had to deal with the trauma of losing a breast because the day that i lost one , i regained one – it even has a nipple ! i think that was a real psychological help			2
’ mentor : @entity6 was discovered by @entity78 in 2009 at the age of 21 nodding her head , @entity6 agrees : ‘ i look at mum now and see how much better she is			1
i appreciate how much more wonderful and beautiful she is than before			0
this past year has changed me as a person			2
i feel about ten years older			0
’ @entity6 has other reasons to be excited about the year ahead			1
she has signed a deal for a third album and there has been renewed interest in her career since singing with @entity255 last month			0
‘ i had n’t done any big concerts for a while but i received a last - minute call asking if i could sing with @entity255			0
the girl he was due to perform with had fallen ill and they needed a replacement			0
this time i asked @entity65 to help me and she rushed across town with a ballgown			0
within hours i was singing with him on stage			0
it was all so fast , i forgot to be terrified			0
‘ it was a magical moment and @entity255 has now invited me to support him next year			1
i really did n’t expect this huge interest all over again			0
i feel as if i have a second chance in my career			0
’ and while @entity6 is optimistic about her prospects , she admits she does have concerns about her breasts after seeing her mother go through such an ordeal			1
she has made an appointment to be tested for the @entity280 - 1 and brca - 2 genes , the presence of which indicates a person is at high risk of developing breast cancer			1
‘ i ’ve decided if i do have the genes , i will do what needs to be done , ’ says @entity6			2
‘ i will be sad because i want children and to breast - feed			2
but it ’s about carrying on with life , not vanity , and if it happens , i know i have the best people around me			0
