by @entity0 last updated at 6:18 pm on 28th december 2011 @entity2 's recent ' new look ' changed the focus of the video - clip site from individual videos to ' channels ' similar to ones on television			2
the site 's transformation into a rival to tv services seems set to continue			0
the latest service from the video giant , @entity14 , is a weekly talent show where users vote on their favourite comedy , music and viral clips			1
@entity2 bills it as a ' video discovery experiment ' - it also has videogame - like elements , where users earn points for accurately predicting favourites			1
@entity2 's @entity14 lets users vote for their favourite comedy , music and viral videos of the week - another tv - like element which will help @entity2 compete with other tv providers ' have some free time this week ? think you can find the next singing sensation , viral video like @entity38 bit my finger or @entity41 ? ' said the official @entity2 blog this week			1
' each week a new crop of videos battles head - to - head in @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 , where your votes determine who wins the @entity14 and gets featured on the leaderboard			0
' earn points for predicting the crowd favorites , and see how you stack up against other players at the end of each week			0
' the move is another unusual shift for @entity2 , which remained broadly the same for years until @entity61 started offering ' channels ' with professional content earlier this year , then rolled this into the site 's ' new look ' in early december			0
the ' competition ' is a new , unfamiliar element - more akin to the apps and games on @entity71			0
' @entity2 is in a process of reinvention at the moment - a rival site , @entity79 , is basically taking all of the music videos away from them , ' @entity72 , a digital media analyst at the @entity75 blog told the @entity82			1
' @entity2 desperately need to create a new relevancy for themselves and that 's why with the recent site relaunch - making it look more like a rich interactive tv - like experience - and features like @entity14 are all about trying to give @entity2 a unique place in the online video landscape			2

users earn points for voting for favourite videos
new talent show feature will make site more ' tv - like '
move in *response* to new rival @entity79 , says analyst
