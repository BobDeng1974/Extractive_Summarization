the hole in the ozone layer above the @entity3 was this year the second smallest it has been in two decades - but still covered an area roughly the size of @entity6 , experts said today			1
the average size of the @entity9 's protective shield was 6.9 million square miles ( 17.9 million square kilometers ) , according to satellite measurements by the @entity11 and @entity13 space agency @entity12			1
researchers say warm temperatures high in the atmosphere helped preserve it			0
the purple and blue colors are where there is the least ozone , and the yellows and reds are where there is more ozone			0
the average area covered by the @entity3 ozone hole this year was the second smallest in the last 20 years @entity12 and @entity11 have been monitoring the ozone layer on the ground and with a variety of instruments on satellites and balloons since the 1970s			1
long - term ozone monitoring instruments have included @entity41 , @entity42 / 2 , @entity44 series of instruments , the @entity46 , the @entity47 , and the @entity49 instrument on the @entity51 satellite			0
' it happened to be a bit warmer this year high in the atmosphere above @entity3 , and that meant we did n't see quite as much ozone depletion as we saw last year , when it was colder , ' said @entity59 of @entity11 's @entity60 in the @entity62 city of @entity63			2
the @entity3 ozone hole , which forms in september and october , reached its largest size for the season -- 8.2 million square miles , roughly the combined area of the @entity13 , @entity67 and @entity68 -- on september 22 , @entity11 said			1
in comparison , the largest ozone hole recorded to date was one of 11.5 million square miles in the year 2000			2
the ozone layer , which helps protect the @entity9 from potentially dangerous ultraviolet rays that can cause skin cancer and cataracts , began developing holes on an annual basis starting in the 1980s due to chlorofluorocarbons , or @entity79			2
@entity79 , once commonly used in refrigerators and aerosol cans , are now almost non-existent thanks to an international treaty signed on september 16 , 1987 , amid global concern over widening holes in the ozone layer			2
still , it could take another decade before scientists detect early signs that the ozone over the @entity3 is returning , @entity11 said			2
the ozone hole reached its maximum size on september 22 , covering 8.2 million square miles ( 21.2 million square kilometers ) , or the area of the @entity13 , @entity68 and @entity67 combined			1
the average size of the 2012 ozone hole was 6.9 million square miles ( 17.9 million square kilometers )			1
the september 6 , 2000 ozone hole was the largest on record at 11.5 million square miles ( 29.9 million square kilometers )			1
the ozone layer above @entity3 likely will not return to its early 1980s state until about 2060 , according to @entity12 scientist @entity99			1
' the ozone hole mainly is caused by chlorine from human - produced chemicals , and these chlorine levels are still sizable in the @entity3 stratosphere , ' he said			0
' natural fluctuations in weather patterns resulted in warmer stratospheric temperatures this year			0
' these temperatures led to a smaller ozone hole			0
' this year also showed a change in the concentration of ozone over the @entity3			0
the minimum value of total ozone in the ozone hole was the second highest level in two decades			0
the ozone layer acts as @entity9 's natural shield against ultraviolet radiation , which can cause skin cancer			1
the september 6th 2000 image that shows the largest ozone hole ever seen over @entity3 the ozone hole phenomenon began making a yearly appearance in the early 1980s			2
the @entity3 ozone layer will likely not return to its early 1980s state until about 2065 , @entity99 said			1
the lengthy recovery is because of the long lifetimes of ozone - depleting substances in the atmosphere			0
overall atmospheric ozone no longer is declining as concentrations of ozone - depleting substances decrease			0
the decrease is the result of an international agreement regulating the production of certain chemicals .			0

the average size of the @entity9 's protective shield was 6.9 million square miles ( 17.9 million square kilometers )
the ozone layer above @entity3 will not return to its early 1980s state until about 2060 , according to @entity12
