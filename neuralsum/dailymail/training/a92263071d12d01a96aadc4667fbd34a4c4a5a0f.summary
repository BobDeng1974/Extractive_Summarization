drivers with license plates ending in letters or other characters must buy their gas on odd - numbered days			1
only a quarter of the city 's gas stations are currently open			2
some are closed because they are out of power , others because they ca n't get fuel from terminals and storage tanks that ca n't unload their cargo			0
at a @entity72 station in the @entity74 neighborhood of @entity75 , drivers said the rationing appeared to be working so @entity77 , 35 , of the @entity78 , gassed up the @entity80 minivan he uses as a pet chauffeur			2

' a couple of days ago i waited four hours			0
they should have done this a long time ago			0

people wait in line for gasoline at a @entity72 station in @entity98 rations : only a quarter of the city 's gas stations are currently open why has rationing been introduced ? @entity44 seriously damaged the north east region ’s petroleum infrastructure and rationing will help ease long waits at the pumps and prevent panic - @entity109 long is it expected to last ? no definitive end date has been set , but mayor @entity19 has said shortages could last another couple of @entity115 does the license plate system work ? those drivers with license plate ids ending in odd numbers are only permitted to buy gas on odd - numbered days , while those with license plates ending in even numbers are restricted to buying gas on even - numbered days			1

can i get gas at any station ? only a quarter of the city 's gas stations are currently open , so be prepared to drive around until you find one			2
a long line outside is a good indicator that a station has gas			0
video : long lines remain despite gas rationing officials said rationing was imposed because something had to be done to ease the long waits for fuel which , they say , has caused panic - buying and hoarding			2
' this is designed to let everybody have a fair chance , so the lines are n't too oppressive and that we can get through this , ' mayor @entity19 said thursday			1
the law is designed to help mitigate the city 's gas shortage after @entity44 swept through the northeast and damaged the petroleum infrastructure in the region			0

mayor @entity19 tweeted : ' this is not a step we take lightly ' police are out in force at gas stations in @entity3 and on @entity4 to enforce the new system ' last week ’s storm hit the fuel network hard and knocked out critical infrastructure needed to distribute gasoline , ' @entity19 said			1
' even as the region ’s petroleum infrastructure slowly returns to normal , the gasoline supply remains a real problem for thousands of @entity3 drivers			2
' he described the emergency order as the best way to cut down the lines and help customers buy gas faster			0
out - of - state drivers are also subject to the system and mayor @entity19 said the shortages could last another couple of weeks			1
the temporary law is similar to the one that @entity133 gov. @entity132 recently implemented in his state , as @entity133 drivers faced similar shortages in the aftermath of @entity44			1
@entity132 also limited gas purchases to 10 gallons per driver			1
long lines at gas stations have persisted as the city struggles to get back on its feet after @entity44 the law is designed to help mitigate the city 's gas shortage after @entity44 damaged the petroleum infrastructure in the region ' this is not a step we take lightly , ' @entity19 tweeted , ' but given gas shortages and the growing frustrations of @entity240 , we believe it ’s the right step			2
' @entity242 has tried to assist the region by shipping gasoline to stations in the hard - hit areas of the @entity247 and at one point the federal agency offered $ 10 in free gas to consumers			2
but the free gas ended up causing further problems for police			0
police made several arrests in the @entity257 neighborhood of @entity98 recently after people jumped ahead of the thousands of otherwise patient drivers waiting in line to fill their tanks			2

a drivers pushes his car to the gas station during the oil crisis in 1973 the long lines and frayed nerves at gas stations in @entity3 and @entity133 has revived memories for some of the crippling @entity146 oil embargo of 1973 , the last time that gasoline was rationed in @entity3			1
that crisis started in october 1973 , when the @entity146 oil - producing states imposed an embargo against nations supporting @entity288 in the @entity289 , also known as @entity290			0
the oil embargo , and the cut in production that accompanied it , doubled the price of crude and reduced overall supply			0
that forced gasoline prices to skyrocket at the pump and led to rationing and prompted @entity302 to question its reliance on @entity146 oil in a region known for its instability			0

the embargo eventually end in march 1974 .			0
