a radical new kind of airship funded by the @entity3 military is about to make its first test flight - and it looks uncannily like the @entity6 craft from the classic tv show			1
the @entity9 airship will carry three times as much as the biggest military cargo planes over thousands of miles , use a third of the fuel , and it does n't even need a landing strip			1
it could also have major implications for cargo haulage , and almost everything now laboriously transported across the planet 's surface by boat , train and lorry could within years be carried through the skies , its makers claim			2
international rescue : the silver - skinned @entity9 prototype sits in its hangar , where green light reflecting from it makes it look uncannily like @entity31 a concept of the airship on the battlefield , where it could be used to transport tanks and soldiers directly onto the front line the radical design has been likened to that of @entity6 @entity42 - based aviation firm @entity41 , with heavy backing from the @entity3 military , has been developing their revolutionary @entity9 for several years , and they say the airship is now in its final stages			1
they have built a prototype which they hope will finally prove the concept works in practice and allow them to fine tune their systems			2
at 77m ( 250ft ) in length , it is just half the size of the final model , but has been built with the same rigid structure , flight control systems and landing gear			1
now all that needs to be done is for it to demonstrate the vertical take - off and landing that will make possible the point - to - point delivery features that will make it perfect for the commercial market			1
the finished version of the @entity9 - expected to be ready in three years - will carry a payload of 66 tons at a speed of 120 knots , upto 18,000ft with a range of 3000 nautical miles			1
that could revolutionise air transport , opening up remote areas where there is practically no other means of access			0
it could carry relief supplies for victims in disaster areas , heavy oil - extraction equipment to northern @entity85 's tar sands , huge turbines to remote wind farms and , of course , heavy military equipment to battlefields worldwide			1
fill ' er up : at 77m ( 250ft ) in length , the prototype @entity9 is just half the size of the final model , but has been built with the same rigid structure , flight control systems and landing gear the ' skeleton ' of the airship being built in @entity42 the key breakthrough has been the development of an internal system for managing ballast			1
previous airships have been held back by the need to weigh them down or tie them up while cargo is unloaded , lest they are suddenly carried away on the breeze			2
but the @entity9 's internal ballast management system gives its operators the ability to control the aircraft 's buoyancy by compressing the helium inside its tanks to make it heavier than air and bring down to the ground			1
once cargo has been loaded , the airship can rise by re-releasing the compressed helium into its containment tanks , making it again lighter than air , then using turbo - prop engines to control its diretion			2
because of this revolutionary system , @entity9 needs no airfield to operate , only a cleared area large enough for it to vertically take off and land , and enough labour on hand to unload the cargo			1
limited : conventional airships are held back by the need for infrastructure that can enable ground crews to fill them with ballast as they are unloaded to stop them from floating away on the breeze @entity141 ballast : the @entity9 , by contrast , is able to control its buoyancy using an internal ballast management system which means it can land anywhere that there is space to touch down @entity41 's founder and ceo @entity148 , 48 , told @entity150 : ' the advantage is you do n’t need ground infrastructure			1
you can fly anywhere , you can land anywhere , you do n’t need any ballast , you do n’t need any ground crew			0
' the airship has long been known as a ' dream machine ' for visionary inventors			0
count @entity161 built the first airship in 1900 as a weapon for @entity164			0
the ' @entity165 ' was developed by dr @entity166 , who flew it around the world in 21 days in 1929			0
this powerful symbol of @entity164 might was adopted by the @entity171 , who funded the creation of the largest airship yet , the @entity174			0
however , on may 6 , 1937 , the @entity174 burst into flames on a trip to the @entity3 , having been filled with patriotic @entity164 hydrogen instead of @entity3 helium			2
but @entity179 - born mr @entity148 says that his design for a rigid airship is miles apart from the disastrous versions of the early @entity183			2
he told @entity150 : ' from the structure stand point , all of us are familiar with the @entity174 and @entity165 designs			0
we built a space frame that sits inside of the vehicle and around the frame we built a rigid cell			0
the function of the rigid cell is to have it work with the aerodynamic laws			0
it ’s a very simple approach			0
' it also allows us to build vehicles very rapidly			0
when you ’re talking about the production of vehicles , you need the ability to build number of them in a short term and with the frames you can do this			0
' the future : an artist 's impression shows how the @entity9 might look as it picks up cargo from a distribution centre			1
finished models will carry 66 tons over a distance of 3,000 nautical miles at 120 knots the ship could also be used for major construction projects such as building large pipes , as it does not require a runway to land the @entity3 military has been a key player in the development of the @entity9 , with the @entity222 and @entity223 giving @entity41 a total of $ 36million towards its research			1
' without the initial funding of the @entity228 it would not be possible to bring such a project to roll , ' mr @entity148 told @entity230			0
accordingly , the first operational versions have already been earmarked for ' intra-theatre airlift ' , @entity233 reports , with each carrying the payload of three @entity236 transport planes , but with the fuel cost of just one .			0

the @entity9 can carry three times more than the biggest military cargo planes over thousands of miles
heavily backed by the @entity3 military , it is now at the prototype stage and is set for its first test flight
it is capable of vertical take off and landing and does n't even need a landing strip
