after some of the worst weeks of his leadership , he may have hoped that taking on a former pop singer in a tv debate would provide a welcome boost			0
but @entity6 was left humiliated last night after he was unceremoniously taken to task by @entity8 over @entity10 ’s proposed mansion tax			1
the party leader looked lost and bewildered as the former @entity13 singer tore strips out of his pledge to impose a tax on homes worth more than £ 2million			1
today mr @entity6 tried to laugh the row off , writing on @entity19 that the @entity20 needs a mansion tax ' @entity22 ' - a reference to @entity13 's biggest hit song			1
appearing on @entity38 ’s @entity37 , miss @entity8 told him : ‘ for me , it ’s so disturbing – the name in its own right : “ mansion tax ”			1
' immediately you conjure up an image of these barbie-esque houses , but in @entity45 , which is where 80 per cent of the people who will be paying this tax actually live , have you seen what that amount of money can get you ? it ’s like a garage			2
‘ when you do look at the people who will be suffering this tax , it ’s true a lot of them are grannies who have had these houses in their families for a long , long time			2
' the people who are the super-super rich buying their houses for £ 140million , this is not necessarily going to affect them because they ’ve got their tax rebates and amazing accountants			2
it ’s going to be the little grannies who have lived in those houses for years and years			0
’ mr @entity6 responded : ‘ i totally understand that people do n’t like paying more in tax			1
the values of my government are going to be different to the values of this government			0
’ tv viewers provided a running commentary on @entity19 , describing how the singer was ‘ doing a @entity32 ’ and ‘ wiping the floor ’ with the man who hopes to be the next prime minister appearing on @entity38 ’s @entity37 , miss @entity8 told him : ‘ you may as well just tax me on this glass of water			1
you ca n’t just point at things and tax them			0
' but former @entity88 ambassador to the @entity89 , sir @entity86 joined in the debate and angrily told mr @entity6 : ‘ you ’re going to screw me royally			1
’ host @entity91 tried to calm things down , saying : ‘ @entity6 ’s getting a bit isolated here			1
’ but miss @entity8 , 36 , interrupted : ‘ @entity6 ’s getting isolated because no one thinks it is going to work			1
’ getting more frustrated , she added : ‘ you may as well just tax me on this glass of water			1
you ca n’t just point at things and tax them			0
‘ you need to have a better strategy and say why is the @entity20 in this mess in the first place ? ’ the confrontation immediately started trending on @entity19			2
host @entity91 tried to calm things down , saying : ‘ @entity6 ’s getting a bit isolated here			1
’ but miss @entity8 , 36 , interrupted : ‘ @entity6 ’s getting isolated because no one thinks it is going to work ’ miss @entity8 sold her former marital home last year for £ 1.8 million – just below the proposed mansion tax threshold – after the breakdown of her marriage @entity8 and @entity6 enjoyed a quick drink with the other panel members and presenter @entity91 last night @entity114 tweeted : ‘ you know it ’s gone truly surreal when @entity8 goes full @entity32 on @entity6			1
’ @entity117 wrote : ‘ @entity6 is currently being schooled by @entity8 on his mansion tax policy			1
’ @entity120 added : ‘ @entity8 is wiping the floor with @entity6 on @entity37 – he could be making case so much better			1
’ another user wrote : ‘ @entity6 says he ’ll take on terrorists , two minutes later he loses an argument to @entity8			1
’ miss @entity8 sold her former marital home last year for £ 1.8 million – just below the proposed mansion tax threshold – after the breakdown of her marriage			1
she currently lives with her daughters in a rented home in @entity129 , north @entity45 , that is worth around £ 3 million			2
if she chooses to buy a house in future it is likely to fall into any mansion tax bracket that would be introduced by @entity10			1
miss @entity8 sold her former marital home last year for £ 1.8 million – just below the proposed mansion tax threshold – after the breakdown of her marriage - but she never got the £ 2.5m she wanted for the property the @entity136 and model now lives on this leafy street in north @entity45 in a rented house believed to be worth £ 3m miss @entity8 was a member of the pop band @entity13 , which was formed by the @entity38 show @entity140 in 2001 @entity6 admitted he has problems with photo opportunities , and suggested @entity143 could help him improve his image			1
the @entity10 leader has insisted that the photo opportunity is ‘ not where my talents lie ' after being pictured struggling to eat a bacon sandwich			1
he has also been mocked for posing wearing a feminist t - shirt and awkwardly giving money to a beggar in @entity152			0
appearing on @entity153 last night , mr @entity6 held up a spoof newspaper front page , with the headline : ' @entity156 plays the @entity157			2
' it was a reference to @entity143 's expertise at the photo opportunity , and the extraordinary pictures released last week in which she posed naked on the front of @entity164 , under the headline ' break the internet '			2
the images sparked countless spoofs online			0
explaining his front page , mr @entity6 said : ' you 'll know she ‘ broke ’ the internet this week with a risque photo opportunity			2
' now all politicians have problems with photo opportunities , me more than most , so i have decided to hire @entity143 to help me with the photo opportunities			2
' mr @entity6 was widely mocked after being pictured struggling to eat a bacon sandwich in may this year			0
he suggested he could learn from @entity143 , who appeared on the front cover of @entity164 last week under the headline : ' break the internet ' @entity8 says you can only buy a garage for £ 2million – in fact it 's a sprawling mansion with an indoor swimming pool and a sweeping drive @entity8 joked last night that in some parts of @entity45 buying a property sitting above the proposed £ 2million mansion tax limit would probably only stretch to a garage			1
but in fact it can stretch to a mansion and outside the capital something even grander			0
however , the singer is right about garages , because last month one went up for sale for an eye - watering £ 550,000			0
overall it is estimated that 108,000 homes – the vast majority in @entity45 and the @entity205 – will be caught by the tax			0
this is what £ 2million can buy you : @entity6 's own home near @entity211 , was bought in his then girlfriend , now wife @entity214 's name in 2009 for £ 1.6million , but is now thought to be worth around £ 2million			1
in @entity216 a four - bedroom terraced property was on sale for £ 2,000,000			0
a similar house on the same street sold for £ 430,000 in 1999 , and is now estimated to be worth £ 2,036,764			2
conservative mp @entity220 said : ' elderly people would find it impossible to pay amounts of up to £ 30,000 per annum to live in their family home which in many cases they have been in for 30 years or more			0
' a four - bedroom semi-detached riverside home in @entity228 , @entity229 , was being sold with a guide price of £ 2,000,000 , in an area where average prices have risen 19.34per cent in the last five years			0
there are also fears that , if the tax is introduced , the threshold could later be reduced as an easy way of boosting government revenue			0
just outside @entity239 , a four - bedroom former farm house is on sale with a guide price of £ 2,100,000			0
the property , which was completely rebuilt in 1999 , boasts five acres of formal gardens and an open plan design			0
other homes in the surrounding area have seen their value rise by an average of 2.88per cent in the last year			0
in @entity254 , semi-detached town houses in desirable parts of the city , where homes sold for around £ 400,000 in the mid- 90s , are on sale for more than £ 2million			1
@entity256 chairman @entity255 has branded the mansion tax plan as an attack on ordinary taxpayers whose family home has soared in value			1
this six - bedroom detached house in @entity265 , @entity262 is on sale for £ 2million , and boasts a heated swimming pool and a snooker room			2
average prices on the street currently stand at £ 910,795 - an increase of 5.27per cent from five years ago			0
a neighbouring ten - bedroom property sold for £ 2million in 2005 , and is now thought to be worth £ 2,152,966			1
a guide price of £ 2,095,000 would buy this four - bedroom farmhouse near @entity275 , @entity276 , which comes complete with its own swimming pool and spa			0
homes in the area sell for an average of £ 962,016 , an increase of 12 per cent from 2009			0
critics have also expressed fears that introducing such a tax would require every home to be accurately valued , which would lead to potentially lengthy appeals should homeowners disagree with the valuation - all of which would come at a cost			0
offers of around £ 2million are being taken for a four - bedroom farmhouse near @entity297 in @entity298 , an area where prices have gone up 7.56per cent since 2009			2
it could also put off wealthy foreign buyers from moving to the @entity88 , and older people who purchased their homes before their value sky - rocketed and who now have a low - income could be forced to sell up and move as they would be unable to pay a new tax			0
a three - bedroom detached house in @entity311 , outside @entity312 is on sale for £ 2.2m			0
there are also fears a mansion tax could put people off making modifications to their homes that might push up the value , having a negative knock on effect on the construction industry			1
and for £ 550,000 ...			0
this dilapidated old shed , which doubled for a garage , in @entity324 , has been snapped up for £ 550,000 before it had a chance to go under the hammer			0
