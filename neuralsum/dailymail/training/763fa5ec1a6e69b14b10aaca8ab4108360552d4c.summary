demolished : the wooden extension was removed by @entity15 this morning as it had been built without planning permission and the cafe owners had apparently ignored requests to remove it cafe : the structure accommodating up to 40 smokers had been illegally added to the back of @entity9 and @entity10 ( pictured ) in @entity12 , @entity13 @entity28 had complained to the council about the noise and smell of tobacco wafting into their homes from the @entity35 cafe , which was open to the small hours of the morning			1
@entity15 said it had given the owners notice to remove the extension but no action had been taken.today council workers arrived to pull down the structure			1
they removed 30 shisha pipes and bags of sweet - smelling tobacco , before taking down the walls and paring the building back to its legally allowed limits			0
in a day of action elsewhere , planning enforcement notices were enforced against unlicensed temporary cabins and a plumber ’s office built at the rear of a property			2

shisha smoking ( right ) is common in the @entity59 and @entity60 and has also become popular in @entity61 in recent years reaction : @entity15 said the demolition was in response to complaints from the cafe 's neighbours , who it said had become ' fed up ' with the illegal structure causing ' extra noise and disturbance ' scene : the shisha cafe was at the rear of a @entity35 restaurant on @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 ' we have got to send a signal to people who think that planning rules are some kind of minor inconvenience that disappear if you ignore them for long enough , ' said @entity15 leader @entity85			1
' that is n’t fair on the silent hard - working majority who abide by the law ... as leader of the council they expect me to be tough on law breakers and i will do exactly that , ' the councillor added			2
@entity15 said the demolition was in response to complaints from the cafe 's neighbours , who it said had become ' fed up ' with the illegal structure causing ' extra noise and disturbance '			2
describing the need to take action against illegal structures , councillor @entity85 said ' ordinary @entity107 residents ' are looking to @entity15 to take a lead on the ' upsurge we are witnessing of beds in sheds - or in this case fags in sheds '			0
the cafe in @entity12 , @entity13 was demolished because it had broken council rules on planning applications - not because it dealt in shisha			1
however , many premises fall foul of the law as a result of legislation that came into force on july 1 , 2007 which made it illegal to smoke in all enclosed work places in @entity128			0
although a loophole meant the ban did not initially apply to shisha premises , this has now been closed and they are no longer exempt from the smoke free legislation			0
as shisha smoking is generally a communal pastime that can last for several hours , many cafes in the @entity61 have created elaborate shelters with heating equipment and furniture designed to replicate the inside of a building			0
providing at least 50 per cent of the structure is open to the air , these shelters are perfectly legal to smoke in , with additional licenses required to serve food , drink and provide entertainment			2
@entity148 is a legal tobacco - like substance that is mixed with sugar or molasses , so the smoke has a sweet smell and taste			0
contrary to the belief of many users , shisha is considered more harmful than cigarettes because the liquid in the pipes does not act as a filter for the harmful toxins			0
