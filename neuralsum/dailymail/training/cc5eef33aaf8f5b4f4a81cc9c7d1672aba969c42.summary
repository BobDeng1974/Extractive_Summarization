in school we 're taught that our tongues have specific areas that are susceptible to different tastes : salty , bitter , sour , sweet or savoury			1
but scientists say that is a myth , and they ’ve found that each of the several thousand sensors on our tongue can recognise any of the tastes			1
and is it is down to cells in the brain , not in the tongue , to work out which taste is which			1
scientists at @entity20 say neurons in the brain not cells in the tongue decide taste			1
they say our thousands of taste buds can all detect different flavours : bitter ( top of diagram ) , sour ( number two ) , salty ( number three ) , sweet ( bottom ) and savoury the research was carried out by scientists at @entity20			1
they studied the 8,000 or so taste buds that are scattered over our tongues , reports the @entity37			1
each taste bud was found to be able to detect the five primary ‘ flavours ’			2
this counters the myth that , for example , only the tip of your tongue can taste sweet food			1
researchers say they have unraveled the genetic code of the rapeseed plant , and say it could lead to better tasting vegetables			0
genomics researchers of the @entity55 's @entity54 collaborative , housed in the @entity56 , have helped unravel the genetic code of the rapeseed plant , most noted for a variety whose seeds are made into canola oil			0
the findings will help breeders select for desirable traits such as richer oil content and faster seed production			0
other potential applications include modifying the quality of canola oil , making it more nutritious and adapting the plants to grow in more arid regions			0
instead they found the brain has specialised neurons that would interpret a signal sent by each taste bud			0
each taste bud had up to 100 receptors that were used to send signals to the brain			1
how exactly the brain processes this information is not clear , but the research shows that the decision on taste is made in the brain , not on the tongue			2
and it puts to bed the theory that there is a ‘ tongue map ’ of different tastes , as once taught in primary schools			2
the finding was made by feeding chemicals with specific tastes to mice			0
scientists then watched how specific neurons lit up when the mice ate the particular chemicals			0
this made their ‘ taste neurons ’ fluoresce when activated			0
‘ the cells were beautifully tuned to discrete individual taste qualities , so you have a very nice match between the nature of the cells in your tongue and the quality they represent [ in the brain ] , ’ professor @entity102 told the @entity37			2
the researchers say one of the benefits of the the findings could be the ability to return taste functions to those that have lost it , such as the elderly			0

scientists at @entity20 say brain not tongue decides taste
they say our thousands of taste buds can all detect different flavours
these are salty , bitter , sour , sweet and savoury
but they send signals to the brain which interprets them into flavours
findings put to bed the myth that our tongues have a ' taste map '
