by @entity0 last updated at 8:41 am on 22nd february 2012 a grieving daughter has been ordered to pay £ 3,000 to a nursing home because she did not give a month ’s notice of her father ’s death			1
@entity6 , 54 , was told she had incurred the costs because a period of 28 days had to be paid in the event of a resident ‘ moving out or passing away ’			1
she received the bill the day after the funeral of her father , @entity12 , who died last month aged 79			1
before his death he had spent 17 months at the care home , for which he paid £ 63,000 of his own money			1
' insensitive ' : following the death of her father @entity12 ( left ) , @entity6 ( right ) was ' shocked ' to receive a £ 3,000 bill because she had failed to give a nursing home a month 's notice of his death the @entity22 sent a letter asking for payment , that ms @entity6 received the day after her father 's funeral yesterday miss @entity6 told of her shock at being billed for failing to warn in advance that her father was going to die			1
she said it was both callous and ridiculous that @entity22 in @entity30 , @entity31 , was demanding the hefty sum			2
miss @entity6 said : ‘ nobody knows when they are going to die			1
in effect they are saying that you have to pay 28 days after you have passed away			2
’ mr @entity40 , who worked for @entity42 gas for 42 years , was admitted to the seaside nursing home , which is run by @entity45 - based @entity44 , after a long battle with dementia			2
he died on january 30 , nine months after his wife @entity48 , 74 , lost her battle with ovarian cancer			2
his daughter , from @entity52 , @entity31 , said : ‘ @entity53 worked very hard and he saved as much money as he could for his retirement			2
then he developed dementia and most of his money had to be spent on his nursing home fees			0
my mother signed the contract before she died and i do n’t know if she was aware of this 28 - day clause			1
‘ often you sign things and do n’t check the small print			0
we were more concerned at the time that @entity53 had a place to go			0
’ the letter from @entity44 informing @entity6 of the 28 - notice period required ' in the event of a resident passing away ' she added : ‘ he seemed happy there			1
he was well looked after and i have no complaints of their care			1
it ’s the issue of the demand for the money			0
it leaves a nasty taste in your mouth			0
’ miss @entity6 , who works as a dog groomer , has been told she owes £ 3,052.16			1
she said she understands the home would incur costs in the time between the death of her father and the arrival of another resident			1
however , she added : ‘ i would n’t mind paying for a week			0
but to pay for a month – which covers his food , laundry and nursing care – is daylight robbery			2
’ and to receive the letter the day after the funeral ‘ was insensitive ’ , miss @entity6 added			1
the chief executive of the @entity100 said @entity44 ’s policy was not standard practice			0
demand : the bill showing the outstanding amount for 27 days of february @entity105 said : ‘ contracts will say that residents need to give a month ’s notice if they are going to leave			1
that is fair and reasonable			0
however , when somebody dies it is a completely different matter			0
i would expect a week to ten days			0
@entity112 to clear the room , that ’s what the extra days should be for			0
’ last night miss @entity6 said she had not heard from @entity44 since it was made aware of her complaint			1
the company seemed , however , to be changing some of its policies			0
ceo @entity118 said : ‘ i deeply regret any distress caused to @entity120 and can confirm that we are in contact with her			0
‘ charging for notice periods is standard industry practice and is necessary to allow care homes to keep rooms available for access by families to remove personal possessions before arrangements are made to re-let the accommodation			2
’ he added the notice period for death will now be reduced to seven days			0
the firm will also wait longer after a death to issue a letter to the next of kin .			0
