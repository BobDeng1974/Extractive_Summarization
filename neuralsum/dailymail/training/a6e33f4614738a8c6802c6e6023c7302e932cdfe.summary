if you 've ever struggled to make a call where there is no phone signal , one enterprising hacker may have the answer			0
@entity7 inventor @entity6 says his invention could lead to a resurgence in the ancient art. he boasted the technique is @entity12 - proof , and free to use			1
this is then heated and vaporized , sending a little cloud of smoke up in the air right in front of the phone 's camera			0
later versions will be able to ' read ' the messages using the camera			0
users have to work out their own code			0
three puffs is ' hello , ' 5 puffs is ' hello , i 'm coming home later , according to the system 's inventor			1
he revealed the project at a recent @entity44 art show			2
@entity45 or @entity15 , takes your device to the next level , ' he said ' based on millennia of experience this @entity50 hardware addon offers you safe , long distance , visual communication for free ! ' smoke is one of the earliest technologies for long distance visual communication - this @entity50 addon offers you the advantages of ancient technology today ! ' at the push of a button , lamp - oil is heated and vaporized , sending a little cloud of smoke up in the air right in front of the phone 's camera			1
' this cloud could potentially be picked up by the camera and translated in real - time , ' @entity72 told @entity76			0
' but , that is for later implementation ' the system also relies on the two participants knowing the code for signals			1
' for example , three puffs is ' hello , ' 5 puffs is ' hello , i 'm coming home later , ' said @entity72			0
a button on the side of the device is currently used to control the smoke signal - future versions could use an app before use , the user must place the lamp oil into the vaporiser			1
the first known use of smoke signals is in @entity100 , where soldiers stationed along the @entity102 would alert each other of impending enemy attack by signaling from tower to tower			2
@entity108 historian @entity107 , came up with a more complex system of alphabetical smoke signals around 150 @entity111 , converting @entity108 alphabetic characters into numeric characters so they can be hidden in pairs - an encryption technique known as as the ' @entity116 ' which was used by @entity7 in the later years of the @entity117			1
the @entity119 indigenous peoples also communicated via smoke signal , with each tribe having its own signaling system and understanding			2
they are still in use today by the @entity125 to reveal the selection of a new pope .			0

art project called @entity15 or @entity130
@entity7 inventor says system is @entity12 - proof
uses a vaporiser and *liquid* to create smoke
code can transmit signals
