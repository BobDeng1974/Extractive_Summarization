by @entity0 published : 22:15 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 08:05 est , 6 september 2013 former @entity2 director general @entity1 has accused the chairman of the @entity4 of ' fundamentally misleading ' @entity5 former @entity2 director general @entity1 has accused the chairman of the @entity4 of ‘ fundamentally misleading ’ @entity5 over the severance pay scandal , leaked documents reveal			1
in an extraordinary submission to the commons public accounts committee ( @entity10 ) , he accused @entity11 of peddling ‘ specific untruths and inaccuracies ’ over the extent of his knowledge of huge payoffs to senior executives			0
on monday , mr @entity1 – who is now chief executive of the @entity19 – will appear before mps with @entity11 to explain the debacle , in which departing @entity2 staff were paid £ 369million over eight years			1
in a 25 - page statement provided to the committee this week , mr @entity1 challenged evidence given by his former colleague to an earlier hearing in july			1
@entity11 has consistently denied the @entity4 was aware of the details of severance payoffs and has suggested the @entity32 ’s governance body was misled over the issue			1
but mr @entity1 said : ‘ the picture painted for the @entity10 by the @entity4 witnesses on 10 july 2013 was – in addition to specific untruths and inaccuracies – fundamentally misleading about the extent of @entity4 knowledge and involvement			2
‘ the insinuation that they were kept in the dark by me or anyone else is false and is not supported by the evidence			0
’ mr @entity1 claims to have emails showing @entity11 was wrong to tell mps he ‘ did n’t know ’ about two huge payments to departing executives – a £ 1.02milion payout to former deputy director general @entity50 in 2011 and a £ 390,000 settlement reached with @entity52 , the former director of marketing			1
mr @entity1 said that @entity11 was told both had received more than they were contractually entitled to			2
he said : ‘ in fact , @entity11 was himself fully briefed , in writing as well as orally , about the @entity50 and @entity52 settlements soon after his arrival as chairman in 2011			0
’ mr @entity1 also accused the @entity4 of withholding key information from the @entity60 ’s investigation into severance payoffs			1
in a 25 - page statement provided to the committee this week , mr @entity1 ( right ) challenged evidence given by his former colleague @entity11 ( left ) to an earlier hearing in july the @entity2 ’s under - fire hr boss has admitted making a mistake in her evidence to @entity5 over excessive pay - offs to senior staff			1
@entity72 initially told a hearing of the @entity74 ( @entity10 ) that she had not seen a note detailing plans for pay - offs to deputy director general @entity50 and marketing boss @entity52			1
but she has now admitted she helped write it			0
ms @entity72 , who announced last month she was quitting the @entity2 , said in written evidence published today : ' during the july 10 hearing , the chair referred to a memo of october 7 2010			1
' at the time , i was not clear which document the chair was referring to and so i could not recollect with absolute certainty whether or not i had seen the memo sent by @entity1 to the then chairman on october 7 2010			0
' since the hearing , i am now clear which document was being referred to and i can confirm that i was involved in drafting that memo , although i had not seen the final note sent to the @entity4 until recently			2
' he said evidence given to the @entity60 and the @entity10 in july was ‘ inadequate , and in some important instances , very misleading testimony ’			0
the public spending watchdog revealed this year that the @entity2 paid £ 25million to 150 departing bosses between 2009 and 2012			1
this week after further scrutiny of the @entity2 accounts , the @entity60 said the broadcaster paid out a total of £ 2.9million in payments that went beyond contractual entitlement between 2006 and 2012			2
in a humiliating u-turn on wednesday , the @entity4 was forced to reveal it had been shown a secret memo – codenamed @entity107 – detailing plans to pay mr @entity50 far more than it was contractually entitled to			2
it is expected @entity109 will put pressure on @entity11 to explain why the @entity4 , which has a responsibility to make sure the @entity2 meets its charter obligations , failed to get a grip on the issue despite being made aware of the wrongdoing			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ the @entity4 witnesses failed to mention the warning i had given them about misleading the @entity10 , or the extent to which they themselves had been briefed about these cases			2
nor did they explain , given how much outrage they claimed to feel and how much they actually knew about the cases , why they did nothing about senior management severance until they themselves came under criticism for the payment made to [ former @entity2 director general ] @entity132			0
’ speaking before details about mr @entity1 ’s evidence to the committee had been made public , @entity10 chairman @entity133 said she had seen evidence of ‘ total chaos ’ at the @entity2			1
asked by @entity139 ’s @entity140 if she thought the committee had previously been misled , @entity133 said : ‘ we will have to discover that next monday			0
‘ certainly those individuals we are having in front of us do n’t agree with each other on what happened or who knew what and until we can unravel that we wo n’t know whether or not we were misled			0
’ also giving evidence on monday will be former @entity4 chairman sir @entity150 and @entity151 , the former chairman of the @entity2 @entity152 which was responsible for approving significant payoffs			1
last night a @entity4 spokesman hit back at mr @entity1 ’s account , saying : ‘ this is a bizarre document			0
‘ we reject the suggestion that @entity11 and @entity158 misled the @entity10			0
‘ we completely disagree with @entity1 ’s analysis , much of which is unsubstantiated , in particular the suggestion that @entity11 was given a full and formal briefing on the exact terms of @entity50 ’s departure , which in any event took place before the current chairman ’s arrival at the @entity4			2
‘ it remains the case , as noted by the @entity60 in its original report , both that the @entity4 under the chairmanship of sir @entity150 was told that these payments were within contractual terms and that the @entity4 did not have a role in the approval process			0
‘ @entity177 has already published its own account of events , which took place well before @entity11 ’s arrival , and we look forward to answering fully and openly further questions at monday ’s pac hearing			0
‘ for @entity11 and @entity158 the overriding concern remains the best interests and good standing of the @entity2			0
