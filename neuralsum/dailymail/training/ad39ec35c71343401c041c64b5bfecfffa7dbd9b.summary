there 's a new majority leader in town come january , and he 's not afraid of long work weeks and late nights , if that 's what it takes to avoid another ' do - nothing ' @entity10			1
long gone are the days of political showdowns that hold up critical bills and common sense legislation , says the incoming @entity15 leader , @entity17 @entity16 @entity14			1
' it was not about legislation			0
it had nothing to do with an outcome			0
the @entity15 basically did n’t do squat for years , ' he told the @entity25 , chastising his @entity27 predecessor @entity26			2
' i do n’t think most members of the @entity15 wanted it run that way			0
' incoming senate majority leader @entity14 , pictured here during an interview at the @entity34 last week , has vowed not to run the upper chamber like his predecessor , @entity37 sen. @entity26			1
the previous way of doing business ' was designed to make us walk the plank			0
it had nothing to do with getting a legislative outcome , ' he said			0
but it 's not just @entity27 who will have to get in line , @entity46 says			1
his own caucus will have to shed its reputation as the party of ' no ' if the @entity16 is to successfully move its agenda and retain its position of authority			1
' one of my challenges is to try to convince some of my members that passing an appropriations bill is a good thing , not a bad thing , ' he told the @entity25			1
' many of my members are not used to voting for appropriations bills			1
but if we are going to pursue our agenda to push back against the bureaucratic overreach seemingly on steroids for the last five or six years , we need to put appropriations bills on the president ’s desk and make him make a choice , ' he said			2
republicans will also have to play follow the leader more often now that they 're in the majority , @entity46 said , and stop holding up the legislative process until they can bend it to their will			2
' there are two kinds of people in politics , ' @entity46 said			2
' those who want to make a point and those who want to make a difference			0
' all of us from time to time make a point , ' he noted			0
' but it is time now to make a difference			0
' perceptions of the 113th @entity10 as the do - nothing legislature are n't wrong			1
according to an analysis of congressional data conducted by the @entity95 , with just over 200 bills signed into law , the current @entity10 was the least productive body since the one that concluded in 1948			1
labeled by then - president @entity101 as the ' do - nothing @entity10 , ' that legislature oversaw the creation of 900 laws			1
' we have a president who was facing a headwind , republicans opposing him in @entity10 and a decline in popularity			2
republicans saw no reason to give us any legislative help , ' @entity112 sen. @entity111 , his party 's no. 2 leader , told the @entity95			1
the conservative and libertarian wings of the @entity16 have argued regularly over the past two years that given the choice between no new laws and laws that advance @entity27 interests , including new regulatory guidelines and rules they perceive as restricting @entity126 ' rights and freedoms , the fewer laws the better			1
but if @entity16 continue to threaten government shutdowns when they do n't get their way and constantly play the role of contrarian , the party risks losing its majorities in both the @entity134 and the @entity15 - and the office of the president in 2016			1
@entity126 may decide they want a united , functional government , regardless of what type of laws it produces			0
@entity46 will have to walk a fine line between keeping the upper chamber on task and stifling debate , however			2
to that end , he 's promised several times since the november elections that catapulted the @entity16 into power that he will allow a free - flowing discussion on the @entity15 floor , unlike previous leader @entity26 , who would often prohibit amendments he did n't like from undergoing debate			1
he 's also committed to keeping the @entity15 in session longer by reestablishing a five - day work week that forces members to stick around on friday instead of starting their weekend early			2
' it will more chaotic , there will probably be later nights , ' @entity46 told the @entity25			2
' the goal is to let the @entity15 express its views			0
' an ecstatic - looking @entity14 celebrates with supporters on @entity164 , tuesday , nov. 4 , after learning that he 'd won reelection to his own @entity15 seat and that his party had won a majority of seats in the legislative body , putting him first in line to be the @entity15 's top dog the strategy is meant to pacify both progressive and conservative firebrands and give them ample opportunity to make their views known without sending the @entity15 into overtime , as it did earlier this month when right - wing sens. @entity180 and @entity181 took to the floor on a friday evening to demand a vote on president @entity185 's immigration orders			1
@entity180 says they were promised a vote before the @entity15 adjourned for the weekend but did not receive it			0
the move infuriated @entity26 , and he left the @entity15 in session through saturday out of spite and used the time to force through presidential nominees whose confirmations had been stalled			0
at a closed - door party luncheon the following week during the @entity15 's final days in session before closing up shop for the holidays , @entity180 begged pardon from fellow @entity16 whose weekends he 'd just ruined			1
' yes , the senator acknowledged that a number of his colleagues had to unexpectedly change their weekend plans , and he apologized to them for inconveniencing their personal schedules			0
that was not his intention , ' @entity180 's spokeswoman @entity207 confirmed to @entity210			0
' his intention was to secure a vote on president @entity185 ’s illegal executive amnesty , and to use every procedural means to do so , ' she explained			0
@entity46 refused to comment to reporters on the events that transpired but made it clear he would n't manage the @entity15 the way @entity27 did in the previous eight years			1
the most recent legislative session was all about ' how many times did we have the point of the week ? ' he told the @entity95			0
' it was designed to make us walk the plank			0
it had nothing to do with getting a legislative outcome			0
' @entity46 has promised several times since the november elections that catapulted the @entity16 into power that he will allow a free - flowing discussion on the @entity15 floor , unlike previous leader @entity26 , pictured , who would often prohibit amendments he did n't like from undergoing debate finally in the seat of power , @entity46 is ready to get down to business on jan. 5 when the new @entity10 convenes , and he and @entity134 speaker @entity242 already have a list of legislative priorities ironed out for the first six weeks			1
' i have studied this job and reached my own conclusions about how it ought to be done , ' @entity46 told the @entity25			0
' it has been a long wait			0
' first up is legislation approving the @entity251			0
a similar effort to authorize the final section of the transnational oil transportation system died in the @entity15 earlier this month , even though it had the support of 14 @entity27 senators in addition to the chamber 's 45 republicans , and the @entity16 believes that next year it will have enough votes to send a bill to the president 's desk			1
also atop of the to - do list is passing legislation to repeal @entity266			2
while the bill will likely receive widespread support in both legislative bodies , it has no chance of becoming law , as the president has already said he will issue a rare veto to keep his signature law in place			1
republicans may find more success in taking a piecemeal approach to dismantling and reforming the health care law , particularly if they focus on areas that @entity27 have also levied complaints at			2
@entity46 has indicated that if their preferred approach to taking down @entity266 fails , they 'll take that tact			0
the @entity134 and @entity15 also likely to take up bills that introduce changes to the tax code , promote trade and boost infrastructure spending at the request of the president , who has argued that he 'll be more likely to work with @entity10 if they 're make a good faith effort to work with him .			1

it 's not just @entity27 who will have to get in line , sen. @entity14 says ; the @entity16 will have to shed its reputation as the party of ' no '
' one of my challenges is to try to convince some of my members that passing an appropriations bill is a good thing , not a bad thing , ' he said
