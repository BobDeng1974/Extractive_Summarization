but the steep inclines and towering mountains are in fact nestled in the heart of @entity11 , @entity12 at the site of a redundant slate quarry			1
@entity16 author @entity15 is known to have drawn inspiration from the @entity19 language when he created the @entity21 dialect his mythical characters speak			0
and so it is possible the @entity24 , which lies between @entity25 and @entity26 , near @entity27 , could have shaped the landscape @entity15 made home to characters including @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			1
rather they are the boundary of @entity24 , once the second largest slate mining quarry in the world the dramatic landscape of @entity11 bears a striking resemblance with the backdrop used for the @entity16 films starring sir @entity54 , pictured playing @entity31 in the @entity55 parts of the quarry could have been used to depict the mythical lands of @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity59 , as seen in @entity16 : two towers , pictured above once the second largest slate mine of its kind , the vast quarry spans more than 700 acres			1
the dark grey slate chipped from the walls of the quarry was used for decades to make roof tiles for homes across @entity69			1
as photographer @entity71 walked through the dramatic scenery , capturing these images , he said he felt as though @entity15 's @entity31 , played by @entity54 , was lurking nearby			1
he said : ' the dramatic surroundings added to the epic feel of the quarry			0
' walking around the place you really felt like you were on some kind of heroic quest , all you needed was @entity31 to top it all off			1
' ' part of the beauty is how untouched the surrounding landscape is			1
all you could see for miles were mountains , fields and a handful of villages , ' said the 24 - year - old from @entity92			1
the redundant quarry was closed in july 1969 after hundreds of years producing slate , which was used to make roof tiles for homes across @entity69 different parts of the quarry resemble scenes from @entity45 , @entity59 and @entity6 , scenes made famous in the @entity16 trilogy directed by @entity102 these slate towers , once a vital part of a piece of equipment which helped move the mined slate to the quarry floor , resembles the geography of @entity6 it is not just the landscape that could have inspired @entity15 , the author is known to have drawn on the @entity19 in creating the @entity114 dialect of his characters photographer @entity71 captured the images			1
he said : ' walking around the place you really felt like you were on some kind of heroic quest , all you needed was @entity31 to top it all off ' at the height of production in the 19th century the quarry produced 100,000 tonnes of slate each year the first attempts at slate mining took place at @entity24 in 1787 when a private partnership secured a lease from the landowner @entity131			1
the attempts were beginning to look fruitful but were dashed by the outbreak of war with @entity134 and rising tax and transportation costs			0
in 1809 @entity131 himself formed a new partnership			0
the construction of a horse - drawn tram line to @entity141 in 1824 gave the quarry a boost , and the business began to flourish			0
at its peak in the 19th century the quarry produced around 100,000 tonnes of slate each year and employed around 3,000 men			2
by 1930 , that number had dropped to 2,000 , but the quarry continued a steady production of slate until its closure in 1969			2
the quarry was closed in july 1969 , leaving the 300 people still working there out of a job			0
in its heyday the quarry employed 3,000 local men the eerie lighting adds to the feeling that the landscape could be that which is inhabited by @entity15 's mythical characters @entity24 was carved out of @entity167 mountain and made up of two main quarry sections and workers used an elaborate network of trams to navigate their way around the vast industrial hub			1
by the 1960s extracting the slate had become difficult			2
after 170 years of chipping away at the landscape , parts of the quarry were beginning to slide into some of the major pit workings			2
a major slide in 1966 nearly ground production to a halt permanently			0
work continued for another two and a half years before the quarry was closed in july 1969 , leaving the 300 remaining members of staff to find work			0
the quarry is now home to the @entity191 and is a popular spot with rock climbers			0
a section of the quarry is used as part of the @entity26 power station , a hydroelectric scheme			0
in the past the disused mine has been used as the setting for films , including scenes from the 1987 film @entity203 and @entity205			2
the quarry lies in the heart of @entity11 , between the villages of @entity25 and @entity26 in @entity12 an elaborate tram network linked the two main sections of the quarry , which spans more than 700 acres it is not just the landscape of @entity12 , which could have provided inspiration for @entity15			1
@entity16 author was known to be heavily influenced by the @entity19			0
dr @entity216 of @entity217 told the @entity218 in an interview in 2011 that the @entity114 language bears a very close resemblance to @entity19			0
he said the author knew both the modern and medieval language very well , adding : ' it 's not so much that he borrowed @entity19 words , more the sounds			0
' this particular @entity114 language is very like the sounds of @entity19 and deliberately so			0
' i have a friend of mine who is a native @entity19 speaker who went to see the @entity16 films and when they started speaking @entity114 in the film she turned to her daughter and said ' they are speaking @entity19 ' so people do see this relationship			2

@entity240 inclines , towering mountains and deep *valleys* trick your eyes into thinking you are peering into @entity5
but the landscape captured by photographer @entity71 is in fact a redundant slate mine in @entity12
@entity24 lies in the heart of @entity11 and was once the second largest mine of its kind in the world
