by @entity0 from battle wounds to medical complaints , skeletons can reveal many secrets about someone ’s daily life			0
now , a @entity8 skull discovered in @entity9 that has a host of interesting features has been found to have a rare dental anomaly			1
using cutting - edge methods , scientists revealed that the owner of the skeleton had a rare case of agenesis , meaning his two central bottom teeth never formed - and it is the first example of this anomaly found in ancient people			1
unusual : a @entity8 skull ( pictured ) discovered in @entity9 with interesting features has been found to have a rare dental anomaly as well as the tip of an arrowhead embedded in his face the genetic trait is so rare it only affects 0.5 per cent of people , according to experts			1
the people of the @entity34 region , to which the skeleton belongs , buried their relatives in formal graves , unlike most other societies during the @entity8			1
their practices give archaeologists a better look into the past , some 4,000 years ago , @entity40 reported			1
the skeleton was discovered in a cemetery northwest of @entity34 along with four arrowheads , one of which was found in an eye socket			1
experts used radiocarbon dating to establish that the remains belong to a 35 - to 40 - year - old male living in the early @entity8 , between 4,360 and 3,935 years ago			1
using cutting - edge methods , scientists found that the owner of the skeleton had a rare case of agenesis so that his two central bottom teeth never formed ( pictured ) located : the skeleton was discovered in a cemetery northwest of @entity34 in @entity9 ( mapped ) along with a disk and four arrowheads , one of which was found in an eye socket an iron tooth implant fitted 2,300 years ago could be earliest false tooth ever found in @entity68 , it was reported last month the dental implant was discovered in the timber burial chamber of an @entity72 woman who died in her twenties in @entity74 , northern @entity75			1
archaeologists believe the false tooth was added to improve the appearance of the corpse as the procedure would have been too painful to endure while alive			0
the implant came in the form of an iron pin found in place of an upper incisor tooth , from which a false tooth would have been attached			0
scientists believe the iron spike was pounded into the pulp canal of nerves and blood vessels to make sure it stayed in place			0
the procedure would have been excruciating had the lady been alive when it was performed			0
@entity96 corrodes inside the body , and one theory is that the lack of sterile conditions may have led to an infection that ended the young lady ’s life			0
another possible scenario is that the dental implant was fitted after her death for aesthetic reasons			0
@entity110 @entity109 from the @entity111 , @entity112 , has been familiar with the unusual skull for a decade when she noted its missing teeth , as well as a stone arrowhead embedded in the area below the place the teeth should be			1
‘ we knew there was a projectile , we could see it , but we did n't know if it occurred years before the individual died or if it happened around the same time as his death , ’ she said			0
‘ i suspected it happened earlier and had something to do with the very unusual missing teeth			2
’ using powerful x-rays to examine the specimen at the university , a team of scientists were able to reconstruct the fragment of the arrowhead in the jaw , using imaging techniques			2
‘ we discovered that the missing teeth had nothing to do with the projectile , ’ dr @entity109 said			2
the experts discovered that the man had agenesis , where the two central incisors do not form			2
the specimen is the only example ever documented by archaeologists to feature this genetic dental abnormality			0
during scans , the researchers also solved the mystery of the embedded arrow tip. dr @entity109 believes the projectile is a piece of the one also found in the eye socket , suggesting it was probably removed from the man ’s face during a fight , or at burial			1
interestingly , there is very little history of violence in the region at that time – with only two more skeletons bearing evidence of fights – but ‘ a projectile fired into somebody ’s face is probably not an accident , ’ dr @entity109 said			0
a historical reconstruction : using powerful x-rays to examine the specimen at the university , a team of scientists were able to reconstruct the fragment of the arrowhead in the jaw , ( pictured ) using imaging techniques			2

the skeleton was found northwest of @entity34 in *modern* @entity9
@entity8 *settlers* buried their dead in cemeteries 4,000 years ago
experts at the @entity111 found the man had a condition called agenesis - where his two central bottom teeth never formed
an arrow head fragment embedded in his jaw , which experts had thought was connected to his missing teeth , has since been found to be *unrelated*
x-rays and imaging revealed he was probably involved in a fight , when an arrow was fired into his face
