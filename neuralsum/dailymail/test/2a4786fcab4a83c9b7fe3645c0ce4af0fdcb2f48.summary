volunteers who have restored one of the @entity4 ' @entity3 ' are now hoping they will be able to take the unique vessel back to the beaches where it helped to rescue 600 @entity9 soldiers			1
fire boat @entity10 was requisitioned from the @entity12 in 1940 and transported to @entity4 to help with the evacuation of @entity15 troops in the face of the @entity18 advance			1
after carrying 600 soldiers back to @entity9 , the boat returned to @entity21 where it helped to save @entity22 and other buildings damaged in the @entity24			1
the boat went out of service in 1971 , and four decades was used as a walkway in a @entity21 dock , allowing people to get to other bessels			2
but @entity21 fireman @entity53 and the @entity54 spent six years restoring it , thanks to a grant from the @entity58			0
they are now seeking additional funding to allow them to transport @entity10 to @entity4 next month , which will mark the 75th anniversary of the @entity3 ' adventure			1
comeback : it took six years to undo the damage wrought on the @entity10 and restore it to how it was in the 1930s @entity69 : the engine room of the old fire boat , which is still working well even though it was first built 80 years ago on board : the controls and fire bell of the @entity10 have also been repaired thanks to a @entity58 grant deck : the boat is mounted with a hose which can pump out 3,000 gallons of water every minute , the same as four fire engines saying goodbye : the @entity10 pictured on its final voyage before being decommissioned as a fire boat in 1971 mr @entity53 said : ' the boat was built in the 1930s and during its career fought fires along the @entity89 and @entity21 before being called to @entity4 in 1940			1
it was the only fire boat to go			1
' it went with the little ships and was initially going to be used as a fire boat but the strafing and gun fire was too much			1
' because it has a shallow hull it was able to get into @entity100 beach outside @entity4 where she rescued 500 troops in three trips across the @entity104 and another 100 back to the @entity9 after that			2
' it did n't stop there because as the @entity10 headed home a @entity110 merchant ship hit a mine about two miles ahead of her			0
the @entity54 went to the aid of the aid and the crew and rescued them as well from the water			0
controls : volunteers who restored the boat praised the quality of its 80 - year - old engineering which still propels the boat journey : a charity needs to raise £ 10,000 so they can afford the fuel needed to take the @entity10 back to @entity4 this year repairs : the engine being removed from the interior of the boat while restoration works were going on commemoration : the vessel boasts a plaque marking its historic status as one of the @entity4 ' @entity3 ' ' of course she was involved in the @entity24 and the @entity10 's pumps helped saved @entity22			1
' the veteran firefighter , who spent 30 years with the @entity12 , paid tribute to @entity10 's unique survival			1
' there is nothing like it left from the 1930s , she is a beautiful ship and the engineering is something to behold , ' he said			0
the trust is seeking at least £ 10,000 to pay for the fuel which would be needed to transport the boat from @entity9 to @entity4			1
after @entity18 invaded @entity155 in september 1939 , the @entity154 ( @entity154 ) was sent to help defend @entity110			0
but in may 1940 , three @entity158 @entity157 corps attacked @entity110 through the @entity159 and quickly advanced to the @entity104			0
by may 21 , the @entity158 forces had trapped the @entity154 and the remains of the @entity110 and @entity163 armies in an area along the northern coast of @entity110			0
the @entity9 force retreated to @entity4 as it was the best site for an evacuation and the @entity169 raged between may 26 and june 4 1940			2
however , in one of the most bizarre military manoeuvres of the war , the @entity170 halted their final advance - this gave the @entity175 three days to plan their escape and arrange the evacuation of 330,000 troops			0
escape : soldiers are pictured queuing up waiting to be rescued from @entity4 during @entity4 @entity182 bosses ordered all owners of boats between 30ft and 100ft to offer them up to the @entity185 , as the @entity182 did not have enough vessels to transport all the troops itself			2
many of these @entity3 - which included ferries , paddle steamers and yachts - were taken without their owners ' permission because there was no time to contact them			0
a total of 700 vessels were joined by 200 warships and proceeded to cross the channel to rescue troops who would otherwise have faced potential disaster at the hands of the @entity170			0
the mission , codenamed @entity4 , was one of the most extraordinary moments of the war , and allowed the @entity9 authorities to rebuild their military strength			0
up to 500 little ships are believed still to be in existence , and they regularly travel back to @entity4 in flotilla to recreate the extraordinary operation .			2

@entity10 was requisitioned from the @entity12 and helped rescue 600 troops from @entity4 in 1940
the vessel went on to save @entity22 during the @entity24 before being commissioned in 1971
but the fire boat has been renovated and restored to its former glory by a group of volunteers thanks to *lottery* grant
they are now seeking another £ 10,000 so they can transport the @entity10 back to @entity4 70 years later
