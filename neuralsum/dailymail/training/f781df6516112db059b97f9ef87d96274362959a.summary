by @entity0 published : 18:37 est , 8 september 2012 updated : 18:38 est , 8 september 2012 and so , at last , the voice of reason			1
last week , researchers from @entity4 published the results of the most comprehensive study to date on organic and conventional foods			1
their conclusion ? organic foods have no more vitamins and nutrients than traditionally grown produce			1
i ca n’t say i ’m surprised			2
chicken is chicken , with the same nutritional content , whether it is organic , free range or mass - produced			1
but now scientists have confirmed it , perhaps we can begin to have a proper conversation about the food we put on our table			1
@entity0 expresses his relief that scientific evidence has revealed no nutritional or safety benefits of organic food over non-organic the @entity4 team reviewed more than 200 studies which compared either the health of those who ate organic and conventional foods , or , more commonly , nutrient and contaminant levels in the foods themselves			1
it included organic and non-organic fruits , vegetables , grains , meat , poultry , eggs and milk			1
not only did the researchers discover organic food is not more nutritious , they also found that , although conventional foods contained more pesticides , these chemicals were well within permitted limits and not harmful in any way			1
in one fell swoop they have demolished the two supposedly incontrovertible arguments of the organic lobby – that their produce has more nutrients and is much safer			1
whether this will be enough to stop the juggernaut remains to be seen but it ’s a start			2
for too long there has been an unbearable smugness about the ‘ organic ’ mob – for that is what it is			1
in certain sections of society , mothers who fail to feed their young organic baby food are looked on with horror			1
then there are the chefs who tell us that eating anything less than organic is somehow immoral			1
i ’m sorry but i do n’t buy into the @entity80 and @entity82 - @entity81 of this world			2
sometimes i wonder is there no escape from this pair of over-seasoned , organically correct pancake - tossers			2
we ’d prefer it if their appearances on tv and in our bookshops were medium rare , but they ’re not			2
@entity0 criticises chefs @entity94 , left and @entity96 , calling them a ' pair of over-seasoned organically - correct pancake tossers ' for imagine if the entire industry were to go organic or free range ? we ’d never be able to feed ourselves			1
what would the price of bread be ? of eggs ? and if all eggs were free range what would happen to the price of biscuits or @entity110 ’s mayonnaise ? do n’t tell me these people have n’t all sat around the business table and eaten those very same biscuits with a cup of tea			0
it ’s all well and good these campaigners getting on their high horse with all their ideals but it has absolutely nothing to do with reality			0
i do n’t like to preach to people			0
@entity0 defends his backing of food producer @entity126 , which sells wafer thin , value - for - money , @entity129 ham slices take @entity131 ’s			1
if i ’m driving down the road and my daughter is tired and hungry , and it ’s gridlocked , what ’s wrong with pulling into the forecourt and buying her a box of six chicken mcnuggets and a milkshake ? if my industry wants to attack me for my views then so be it but i ’d rather go into a @entity143 , pay my money and know what i ’m getting than go to a lot of fancy restaurants that all too often offer so much and deliver too little			0
i ’d rather spend 99p on a cheeseburger than £ 20 on some main course that does n’t deliver			0
it ’s all about value for money			0
and how many restaurants serve organic or free range ? are the bones they use for their stock from animals raised on organic farms ? are their sauces made from organic tomatoes ? of course not			1
restaurants simply do n’t do organic because they ca n’t justify the price			1
if they banned industrial farming , chicken would become a luxury item			0
the idea that something as simple – and nutritious – as a chicken should be denied to families on a lower income is frankly appalling			0
if it was n’t for commercial farming there would n’t be sunday lunch for millions of families			0
if you go down to the supermarket and go to the fish counter , how often is the sea bass farmed , the prawns , the salmon , the trout ? and there is nothing wrong with that if it is done well			0
the same goes for meat			0
it takes the pressure off the wild stock and means the average person can eat well			0
@entity0 has little time for ' snobs ' who only buy organic food and those who only shop at more pricey stores such as @entity200 that ’s what farming does – it makes food available to everyone			1
i come from humble beginnings , growing up , one of four boys , on a @entity211 council estate			0
we always ate well because my grandfather and father were both chefs			0
a journalist once asked me , ‘ what was it like growing up poor on tinned food ? ’ we could n’t afford tinned food , i hankered after it			1
when i endorsed @entity126 i was castigated by all and sundry but if it was n’t for him , we would n’t have had turkey on the table at @entity226			0
a proper meal enriches family life			0
i would rather have dinner cooked with love – preferably by someone who can cook – than some dried - up old piece of organic chicken			1
there are certain people who would n’t be seen dead in any other supermarket than @entity200			0
i abhor that kind of snobbery			1
not everyone can afford organic so stop bullying them , stop patronising them , stop dictating to them			2
and as we now know , it ’s not even worth the extra cost			0
in some instances , i would argue that non-organic food can be better for you			1
for example , regular pork loin steak has 6.2g of fat per 80g , while the organic equivalent has 21.4g			2
yet we all know that too much fat is bad for us			0
what ’s important is that rich or poor , organic or mass - produced , you are getting the same vitamins			2
in a strange way , i am more in favour of mass - produced farming than the organic movement			2
i look at organic as a label , nothing more			2
and a very expensive one at that			0
three out of four households buy organic food , with the market worth more than £ 1 billion a year			1
i have a theory that people who are n’t very good cooks buy organic to compensate			2
sales of organic food in the @entity274 are the second highest in @entity275 and at a time when food prices are sky - rocketing			1
consumers have seen the price of their weekly food shop increase by 6.4 per cent over the past year , double the @entity282 average			2
the only thing that should dictate your choice is your palate and your pocket			1
when i go to the butcher or the grocer i buy what looks good			0
provenance is important to me			0
would i prefer to have my pork chop locally sourced from a small farmer ? yes			0
if you can afford to buy pork or beef or lamb reared by an independent farmer , that ’s great			0
but do n’t criticise and patronise the people who ca n’t			0
thanks to this report all those , like me , who have never believed the organic hype , do n’t have to listen to their dogma any longer .			2

@entity0 *celebrates* the results of a large @entity310 study that shows no nutritional or safety benefits of organic food
an *assessment* of 200 studies compared the health of those eating organic versus non-organic food
although conventional foods contained more pesticides the levels were well within permitted limits and not harmful in any way
@entity0 abhors organic food snobbery and says the only thing that should *influence* choice should be ' your palate and your pocket '
