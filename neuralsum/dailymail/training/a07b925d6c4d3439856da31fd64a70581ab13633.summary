the 300 - page investigative file on 12 - year - old @entity6 tells how she was concerned about her mother and stepfather 's fighting , had been involuntarily committed and wrote in her diary that she cut herself to ‘ ease the pain			1
’ in a diary entry dated two weeks before she leaped to her death in september 2013 , the girl notes that on one particular day , she had been called ‘ pretty , nice beautiful , funny , awesome			1
’ yet she also had been called ‘ ugly , stupid , slut , fat , not good enough			0

’ however , the file contains scant evidence of cyberbullying , even though officials publicly described cruel text and social media messages as reasons for @entity6 's suicide			1
two classmates were charged with stalking @entity6 because of in - school , in - person conflicts , and @entity40 sheriff @entity39 has said the girl also endured a barrage of cruel text and online messages before her death			1
in spite of the public case against them , the prosecution ultimately fell apart because of a lack of evidence			0
‘ @entity6 was a very fragile child , ’ @entity39 said in a recent interview			0
‘ @entity6 's wagon was already pretty heavily burdened with bricks			1
and we never said that bullying was the only reason @entity6 committed suicide			0

’ an attorney representing @entity6 's mother did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment			2
after @entity6 's death , @entity39 said as many as 15 classmates had ganged up on the girl and sent her messages saying ‘ you should die ’ and ‘ why do n't you go kill yourself ? ’ but no such messages appear in the case file , although detectives interviewed some students who said they had seen such messages			1
@entity39 said his detectives tried to obtain records from social media companies overseas without success			0
there are no chat transcripts between @entity6 and her alleged bullies			0

’ the case underscored the difficulty of prosecuting bullying cases , especially cases using online evidence			0
@entity6 's mother and others called for bullying to be criminalized , but a bill that would have done just that died in the @entity165 this year			2
lawmakers and law enforcement officials — including sheriff @entity39 — opposed the bill because they said cyberbullying in particular was difficult to prosecute .			0
