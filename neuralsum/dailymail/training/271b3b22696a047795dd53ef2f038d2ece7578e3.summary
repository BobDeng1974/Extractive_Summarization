by @entity1 reporter published : 07:43 est , 28 august 2013 @entity3 : 10:04 est , 28 august 2013 the @entity4 has secretly labeled entire mosques as terrorism organisations , a designation that allows police to use informants to record sermons and spy on imams , often without specific evidence of criminal wrongdoing			1
since the 9/11 attacks , the @entity4 has opened at least a dozen ' terrorism enterprise investigations ' into mosques , according to interviews and confidential police documents			1
the @entity20 , as it is known , is a police tool intended to help investigate terrorist cells and the like			2
many @entity50 stretch for years , allowing surveillance to continue even though the @entity4 has never criminally charged a mosque or @entity27 organisation with operating as a terrorism enterprise			1
the documents show in detail how , in its hunt for terrorists , the @entity4 investigated countless innocent @entity59 @entity58 and put information about them in secret police files			1
as a tactic , opening an enterprise investigation on a mosque is so potentially invasive that while the @entity4 conducted at least a dozen , the @entity65 never did one , according to interviews with federal law enforcement officials			1
the strategy has allowed the @entity4 to send undercover officers into mosques and attempt to plant informants on the boards of mosques and at least one prominent @entity78 - @entity77 group in @entity79 , whose executive director has worked with city officials , including @entity82 , a front - runner for mayor			1
@entity85 , the executive director , said her group helps new immigrants adjust to life in the @entity77 it was not clear whether the police were successful in their plans			2
under suspicion : since the 9/11 attacks , the @entity4 has opened at least a dozen ' terrorism enterprise investigations ' into mosques , including the @entity27 of @entity29 in @entity79 ' i have never felt free in the @entity77			1
the documents tell me i am right ' : @entity96 , founder of the @entity27 of @entity29 pictured ( left ) reviewing the @entity4 files which reveal his mosque had been under surveillance and ( right ) on a protest march in @entity59 in support of ousted @entity103 president @entity102 @entity85 , a muslim who has met with @entity107 many times , said she felt betrayed			1
' it creates mistrust in our organisations , ' said @entity85 , who was born and raised in @entity79			0
' it makes one wonder and question who is sitting on the boards of the institutions where we work and pray			0
' the revelations about the @entity4 's massive spying operations are in documents recently obtained by @entity122 and part of a new book , enemies within : inside the @entity4 's @entity127 and @entity128 's @entity126			2
the book by @entity122 reporters @entity131 and @entity132 is based on hundreds of previously unpublished police files and interviews with current and former @entity4 , @entity135 and @entity65 officials			1
among the mosques targeted as early as 2003 was the @entity27 of @entity29			2
' i have never felt free in the @entity77			0
the documents tell me i am right , ' @entity96 , one of the @entity29 mosque 's leaders , said after reviewing an @entity4 document describing his mosque as a terrorist enterprise			1
on the defence : @entity59 mayor @entity146 ( left ) and @entity4 commissioner @entity107 ( right ) have previously denied accusations that the force engaged in racial profiling while combating crime @entity96 , 59 , came to the @entity77 decades ago from @entity152 's @entity151			1
' @entity153 , shame on him , ' he said			0
' the @entity4 believed the tactics were necessary to keep the city safe , a view that sometimes put it at odds with the @entity65			1
in august 2003 , @entity159 asked the @entity65 to install eavesdropping equipment inside a mosque called @entity162 , including its prayer room			2
@entity164 had a long history of radical ties			0
@entity167 , the blind @entity103 sheik who was convicted of plotting to blow up @entity59 landmarks , once preached briefly at @entity164			0
invited preachers raged against @entity152 , the @entity77 and the @entity172 administration 's war on terror			0
one of @entity159 's informants said an imam from another mosque had delivered $ 30,000 to an @entity162 leader , and the @entity4 suspected the money was for terrorism			1
former @entity135 chief @entity180 ( above ) said a terror attack similar to the @entity182 could not have been executed in @entity59 because of the @entity4 's extensive spying on @entity58 but @entity184 , the @entity65 assistant special agent in charge for counterterrorism , refused to bug the mosque			1
she said the federal law would n't permit it			0
the @entity4 made other arrangements			2
@entity159 's informants began to carry recording devices into mosques under investigation			0
they hid microphones in wristwatches and the electronic key fobs used to unlock car doors			0
even under a @entity20 , a prosecutor and a judge would have to approve bugging a mosque			0
but the informant taping was legal because @entity59 law allows any party to record a conversation , even without consent from the others			0
like the @entity27 of @entity29 , the @entity4 never demonstrated in court that @entity164 was a terrorist enterprise but that did n't stop the police from spying on the mosques for years			1
the disclosures come as the @entity4 is fighting off lawsuits accusing it of engaging in racial profiling while combating crime			1
earlier this month , a judge ruled that the department 's use of the stop - and - frisk tactic was unconstitutional			0
the @entity220 and two other groups have sued , saying the @entity223 spying programs are unconstitutional and make @entity58 afraid to practice their faith without police scrutiny			1
both mayor @entity146 and police commissioner @entity107 have denied those accusations			0
they say police do not unfairly target people ; they only follow leads			0
' as a matter of department policy , undercover officers and confidential informants do not enter a mosque unless they are following up on a lead , ' @entity107 wrote recently in @entity237			0
' we have a responsibility to protect @entity59 from violent crime or another terrorist attack - and we uphold the law in doing so			0
' an @entity4 spokesman declined to comment			2
in may , former @entity135 chief @entity180 said a terror attack similar to the @entity182 could not have been executed in @entity59 because of the @entity4 's extensive spying on @entity223 communities			2
before the @entity4 could target mosques as terrorist groups , it had to persuade a federal judge to rewrite rules governing how police can monitor speech protected by the @entity253			1
the rules stemmed from a 1971 lawsuit , dubbed the @entity257 case after lead plaintiff @entity257 , over how the @entity4 spied on protesters and liberals during the @entity261 era			1
@entity159 , a former @entity135 executive who became @entity4 's deputy commissioner for intelligence in 2002 , said the old rules did n't apply to fighting against terrorism			1
@entity159 told the judge that mosques could be used ' to shield the work of terrorists from law enforcement scrutiny by taking advantage of restrictions on the investigation of @entity253 activity			0
' @entity4 lawyers proposed a new tactic , the @entity20 , that allowed officers to monitor political or religious speech whenever the ' facts or circumstances reasonably indicate ' that groups of two or more people were involved in plotting terrorism or other violent crime			2
the judge rewrote the @entity287 rules in 2003			0
in the first eight months under the new rules , the @entity4 's @entity289 opened at least 15 secret terrorism enterprise investigations , documents show			1
at least 10 targeted mosques			0
and under the new @entity287 guidelines , no one outside the @entity4 could question the secret practice			2
@entity296 , one of the lawyers in the @entity257 case , said it 's clear the @entity4 used enterprise investigations to justify open - ended surveillance			1
the @entity4 should only tape conversations about building bombs or plotting attacks , he said			2
' @entity223 is a potential terrorist ? it is completely unacceptable , ' he said			0
' it really tarnishes all of us and tarnishes our system of values			0

@entity4 has opened at least 12 ' terrorism enterprise investigations ' since 9/11
police spied on countless innocent @entity58 and stored information on them
no @entity27 group has been charged with operating as a terrorism enterprise
investigations are so potentially invasive even the @entity65 has not opened one
comes as @entity4 fights lawsuits accusing it of engaging in racial profiling
