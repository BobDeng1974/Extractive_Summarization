by @entity0 published : 19:20 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 19:20 est , 25 october 2013 a @entity2 judge is expected to make a ruling on whether a sperm donor who answered a @entity7 ad and signed away parental rights is responsible for child support			1
@entity10 and his wife are fighting the state ’s efforts to seek child support from him after the @entity16 mechanic provided sperm to a lesbian couple in 2009 for the purposes of artificial insemination			1
a decision is expected by the end of the year			0
mr @entity10 found the couple through an ad on @entity7 and signed a contract voiding his parental rights			1
the state of @entity2 alleges he is the father and owes support , he is fighting that claim			2
not my problem : @entity10 argues he is not responsible for the child 's welfare lawyers for the state are moving to have mr @entity10 named the child ’s father and have even requested a dna test , which he said is not necessary because he is the father , according to the @entity39			2
though not contesting his blood relation to the child , mr @entity10 has argued the contract he signed with @entity43 and @entity44 disavowing his parental rights voids his monetary responsibility for the child			1
the state ’s position is that since the semen donation was not made through a licensed physician , rather through the use of a catheter and syringe after he provided the semen sample in a cup , that mr @entity10 ’s responsibility to the child is the same as if he fathered the child naturally			2
' this is not a case about a sperm donor contract , it ’s about child support , ' @entity64			0
an attorney for the state , said friday , according to @entity67			0
raising the child : @entity69 ( left ) and @entity43 ( right ) signed a contract with mr @entity10 absolving him of all parenting responsibilities where it all began : mr @entity10 answered an ad placed by the couple on @entity7 ' [ @entity10 ] can not get out of his support obligations because he did n’t follow state law , ' mr @entity64 continued			1
' the contract they drew up means nothing			0
'' state lawyers have cited a statute they believe pertains to this case as the reason for proving mr @entity10 ’s need to pay child support			1
‘ the donor of semen provided to a licensed physician for use in artificial insemination of a woman other than the donor ’s wife is treated in law as if he were not the birth father of a child thereby conceived , unless agreed to in writing by the donor and the woman , ’ the law states			0
mr @entity10 ’s lawyers argued that since this donation was done outside the presence of a doctor , the law has no application , nor does it provide guidance for how to proceed in such a case , according to the paper			0
the case ended up in court after mr @entity10 was ordered last year to pay child support to the couple , which has since split up			2
lawyers for both sides have moved for a summary judgement in the matter , relinquishing their right to a trial , and have said they expect a decision by the end of the year .			0

@entity10 donated sperm to a lesbian couple after finding them through a @entity7 ad
he signed away parental rights to the child in a legally binding contract
the state of @entity2 claims the contract is *invalid* and he owes child support to the couple
mr @entity10 is fighting the state , saying there is no legal *precedent* for such a move
