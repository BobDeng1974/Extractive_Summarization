banned : @entity0 will now be banned from all leave - on cosmetics thanks to a @entity3 campaign a chemical is to be banned from beauty products after an investigation by @entity3 showed it was responsible for triggering one of the worst skin - allergy epidemics doctors have seen			1
the preservative methylisothiazolinone – also known as @entity10 – has been a popular ingredient in moisturisers , sun creams , shampoos and even baby wipes			1
but in july , this paper revealed that one patient in ten who went to hospital with the painful skin condition dermatitis had suffered an allergic reaction to @entity10			1
after our report , @entity22 dermatologists demanded action , warning the epidemic would only intensify			0
now the @entity27 is set to outlaw the chemical from all leave - on cosmetics that are rubbed on to the skin , and dramatically reduce its use in rinse - off products such as shampoo			1
the @entity27 is expected to announce the plan next week after @entity35 , the trade body for 4,000 cosmetics firms , took the unprecedented step of advising its members to urgently remove @entity10 from products left on the skin			1
dr @entity42 , president of the @entity43 of @entity44 , said he was delighted			0
‘ it is good news there are proposals to regulate , ’ he added			0
‘ we are also pleased the industry itself is advising members to remove @entity10 from leave - on products so that consumers are protected even more quickly			2
’ dr @entity55 , a consultant dermatologist at the @entity56 at @entity56 in @entity57 who campaigned for tighter regulations , said : ‘ i ’m delighted something is being done			0
‘ there is strong evidence that the number of patients affected is continuing to rise and so it is clear that strong action is needed			0
’ @entity10 started being used as a preservative in 2006 but only recently became a popular ingredient , triggering a surge in allergic reactions			2
last year , only about six per cent of dermatitis patients were found to be sensitive to @entity10			2
by this summer , the figure had jumped to ten per cent and now , estimates suggest the number is 14 per cent			0
reaction : one in ten sufferers of dermatitis were found to have had an allergic reaction to the chemical in september @entity80 said it would change the formula of its @entity83 1 day long suncream after more than 150 people told of reactions			1
under current rules , @entity10 can be added to cosmetics at a concentration of 100 parts per million			2
but next week , the @entity27 ’s @entity90 on @entity91 will say that @entity10 should be banned from all leave - on products and used at just 15 parts per million in rinse - off products			1
it is this second proposal that is likely to cause controversy , as many companies contest the claim that @entity10 in rinse - off products causes harm			0
however , dermatologists argue there is now a pool of people sensitised to @entity10 who could react to it even in shampoos and shower gels .			0
