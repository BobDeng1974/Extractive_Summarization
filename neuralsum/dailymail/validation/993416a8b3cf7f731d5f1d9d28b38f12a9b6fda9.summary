having left home at 16 to pursue football against his mum ’s wishes , @entity0 is thankful he can smile now			1
so much so he is able to give a highly animated impression of her watching him play for @entity8			1
squinting to study an imaginary television back home in @entity12 , his arms flap wildly			1
‘ do n’t kick him ! ’ he shouts , mimicking his mother @entity14 ’s voice			1
‘ @entity17 ca n’t you see ! ’ he jabs his fingers			1
‘ each time @entity8 play my mother is wearing my shirt , sitting down in front of the telly , and she is like this , ’ @entity0 laughs			1
@entity0 told @entity25 about his journey from @entity12 to @entity8 @entity0 's success story is one for @entity8 fans and football supporters in general to truly admire the @entity8 striker left his home at 16 to pursue a career in football against his mother ’s wishes the 26 - year - old is beginning to make his stamp as the @entity40 club 's most expensive signing @entity44 ( centre ) scores @entity8 's third goal in their hammering of @entity46 in the @entity48 fifth round it is quite some turnaround given she banned him from playing the game as a 14 - year - old through fears he would get caught up with criminal gangs on the streets of @entity58			1
after his father @entity60 died , she even sent him to her sister ’s remote village eight hours away to keep him from football and , as she saw it , trouble			1
a decade later @entity0 , 26 , is @entity8 ’s £ 10million record buy and , after initial difficulties , beginning to make good on his pricetag			1
he faces @entity69 in the @entity48 quarter - final on saturday , looking for revenge on the local rivals who triumphed in a dramatic @entity75 match on tuesday night			1
he scored two goals in the last round to do more than any in the 4 - 0 destruction of @entity46 , and is allowing himself dreams of @entity79			1
a may date at the grand stadium might present the chance for his mum to support her son in person for the first time			1
‘ in summer it ’s possible , right now it ’s cold for her , ’ he says			1
‘ i want us to get to the final			1
if we do then i can arrange it			1
’ had she got her way all those years ago , however , @entity44 would not be a @entity75 player			1
‘ it ’s hard growing up in @entity58 , ’ he says			1
‘ there is always a story to tell in a city like that			2
my friends were involved in crazy stuff			1
they were bad boys of the area			2
i was picked up once by the police			1
@entity0 experienced a frustrating start to his @entity8 career and attracted criticism for his lack of goals the @entity8 front man was on the verge of a cut - price deal on deadline day to @entity115 side @entity114 but @entity0 is willing to overcome the obstacles he has faced in the @entity75 since joining @entity8 ‘ my mum stopped me going out with them			1
each time i told her i wanted to play football she would say , “ no you ’re going to be with your friends ”			1
’ @entity0 was sent to live with his aunt but eventually ran away to train with his old coach and finally told his mum he wanted to make a 200 - mile trip to @entity127 to play regularly			1
‘ she did n’t accept			2
that ’s how i left			2
i went to @entity127 then @entity130			1
then bam , bam , bam			2
’ the bams are @entity132 in @entity133 , @entity134 in @entity135 , and @entity136 in @entity137 , where he scored 33 goals in 74 games and earned most of his 24 @entity12 caps			2
once he had signed professional forms , @entity0 patched up his relationship with his mum			1
‘ when i got the contract in @entity133 i went back home , sat with my family and had breakfast , dinner , lunch , everyone happy			2
‘ afterwards she called me into her room and said , “ i ’m sorry about everything , your dad is late and i am the only person who can guide you			2
i looked at what your friends were doing and believed if i left you that is how you ’d become			1
” i said , “ i get that			2
she could not believe she tried to stop me becoming what she is enjoying today			2
’ @entity0 spoke frankly about being sent to live with his aunt in order to keep him out of trouble as a youth having looked well short of his pedigree in the opening months of the season and on the verge of a cut - price deal on deadline day to @entity115 side @entity114 , a glorious spell of four goals in six days ( three games ) followed			1
cultivating an understanding alongside @entity175 and with guidance from @entity177 , @entity44 looks to have found his feet in @entity179			2
‘ i took a lot of time to adapt , ’ he admits			2
‘ i was overwhelmed that i am the record signing			2
i put a lot of pressure on myself			2
‘ the game does n’t turn out the way i want , i become frustrated , i keep on pushing when i am supposed to calm down			2
things were going so fast			0
‘ as for the social media , you ca n’t expect everyone to like you			0
they will say what they want			0
i do n’t see what can shake me given what has happened before			0
they are pushing me to my success			0
i like people criticising me			0
@entity8 supporters were annoyed by comments made by @entity69 manager @entity204 on tuesday ‘ that one week turned out to be something i dreamt			0
i felt this day would come			0
getting back to the @entity0 people know			1
‘ one day the people who are saying , “ he ’s no good ” are the same people who will say , “ do n’t let him go			0
” ’ he denies he would ever have gone to the @entity210 in a £ 3.8m deal			0
‘ i do not have to run to anywhere			0
’ he hopes to be running in celebration at @entity214 , performing the somersault tumble that marked his last goal			0
‘ i always did that when i was a child , ’ he says			0
‘ when you ’re excited you find yourself doing things you do n’t plan			0
the fans love it so i will keep on doing it			0
’ he also wants to make @entity204 reassess his belief that @entity8 are a ‘ good little club ’ , a throwaway comment not intended to disparage that has irked their supporters			0
‘ i think it ’s not the right thing to say , ’ says @entity0			1
' but i guess if he sees us as a small club and @entity69 as a big club and on tuesday we lost , then he will have the upper hand to say what he wants			0
to make him realise @entity8 is far higher than @entity69 we have to win			0
we have a game where we can redeem our image by winning			0
’ @entity69 striker @entity238 celebrates his goal against local rivals @entity8 earlier this week defeat on tuesday night stung , particularly as it was @entity242 ’s error in the final minute which proved costly and that @entity244 ’s high challenge on @entity175 was not met with a red card			1
‘ @entity242 is a great guy , a lot of people make mistakes in football , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ he apologised to everyone , but it is already done			0
’ on @entity244 he adds : ‘ i did n’t really see it at the time but i was watching @entity259 , i called my wife and said , “ look at this ”			0
i feel a little bit scared that a defender would go in like that			0
‘ it ’s the pressure of the game , everyone wants to go hard			0
but you still have to respect the fact it is football			0
you have to respect each other			0
for me i do not see that as a good thing			0
there are for sure going to be tackles but not that high			0
’ the image of @entity79 provides most motivation though			0
‘ the @entity69 game was just a reminder for us that we could lose a game in that manner , it is for us to sit up and know that to get to @entity79 we need to work hard			0
‘ every game we play under @entity177 we give our all , sometimes we win sometimes we lose			0
we just have to add more than what we did on tuesday			0

at 16 , his mum sent him to live with his aunt to keep him away from trouble
@entity0 said : ' my friends did crazy stuff . i was once picked up by the police '
the young striker then ran away to train with his old coach in @entity127
