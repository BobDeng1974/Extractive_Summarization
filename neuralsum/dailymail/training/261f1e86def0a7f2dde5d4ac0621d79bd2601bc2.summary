by @entity0 , royal correspondent and @entity3 reporter published : 17:32 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 19:20 est , 26 march 2013 @entity5 gov. @entity4 says no one will be getting naked when prince @entity6 visits @entity5 in may			1
a listener asked @entity4 on a radio call - in show monday if there are any plans to make sure the prince behaves			1
@entity4 says he 'll be with @entity6 the entire time and that @entity13 knows she can trust her grandson with the governor of @entity5			1
no nudity : gov. @entity4 has promised to keep an eye on @entity6 to ensure there will be no mad antics when he visits the state in may on his last @entity26 visit , the third - in - line to the @entity24 throne was caught frolicking in the nude with a woman in @entity29 after an alleged game of strip billiards			1
the governor says lots of young people make mistakes			0
@entity4 , speaking on @entity37 's ‘ ask the governor ’ program , says he 's thrilled the prince wants to see the damage caused by @entity41 and be helpful			2
the 28 - year - old prince will visit @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity5 and @entity47 in a week - long trip which he hopes will highlight the work of his charities , particularly those supporting injured servicemen and women			1
he will also be on official business on behalf of the @entity55 , helping to promote trade , commerce and tourism abroad			0
naughty prince : on his last trip to @entity26 , prince @entity6 visited @entity29 for a scandalous lads ' holiday which ended in tabloid headlines @entity4 will be showing the prince the damage caused by @entity41 , as he did with president @entity65 @entity6 is still living down his last trip to the @entity26 , last august , when he enjoyed a ‘ lads ’ holiday ’ in @entity29 and was photographed naked playing a game of ‘ strip billiards ’ with a party of women in his £ 5,000 - a - night hotel suite			1
he has refused to apologise publicly for his antics , which caused huge embarrassment to the @entity76 , but has admitted that he let them down			0
but last year he also completed his first , hugely successful , official solo royal tour to the @entity79 and @entity80 , where he won admiration for his warmth and enthusiasm , dancing in the streets with locals and doing his best to race @entity86 , the fastest man on @entity87			0
according to sources , @entity6 , who recently returned from four months in @entity88 as an @entity90 attack helicopter pilot , will undertake this latest trip in his own ‘ indomitable style ’			2
it is sure to be a draw for royal fans as the @entity98 and @entity99 , who are expecting their first child in july , will not travel abroad this year , palace sources have confirmed			0
@entity6 's cause : the 28 - year - old @entity103 will also play in a polo tournament on behalf of @entity105 , the organisation he personally set up to help @entity108 orphans in @entity109 which he visited last month @entity6 ’s trip begins in @entity43 on may 9 with a visit to an exhibition on @entity113 to publicise the work of landmine clearance charity @entity115			1
he will also make a pilgrimage to the @entity118 and aides have not ruled out a meeting with president @entity65			0
the main focus of the trip , however , will be the 2013 @entity123 in @entity45 which will see more than 200 wounded servicemen , including a 35 - strong @entity24 team , compete in seven sports			0
@entity6 will then fly on to @entity5 to visit an area affected by last year ’s @entity41 and carry out several engagements in @entity46			2
the highlight of this part of the trip is an event to publicise the great campaign , led by the @entity134 , to promote @entity24			0
mischief managed : when in @entity29 , prince @entity6 , right , caused controversy when he was photographed naked with a group of women in his £ 5,000 a night hotel suite and no trip to @entity46 would be complete without the prince attending , and perhaps trying his hand at , a game of baseball			1
he will end his tour on may 15 by playing in the @entity146 in @entity147 , @entity47 , a huge fundraising event for his charity			0
@entity6 will travel on commercial flights to and from the @entity26 and will be accompanied by five staff , plus security			2
the cost of the trip will be met largely by his charities but in part by taxpayers as he will be conducting some official business			0
fortunately for his security team there will be little chance for time off – and certainly no visits to @entity29 – as he needs to return to the @entity24 to resume his military duties			2
close to heart : prince @entity6 's trip will focus on his many charities , particularly those involving the rehabilitation of soldiers injured in service military man : the support for both @entity24 and @entity26 troops is important to @entity6 who recently returned from a four - month deployment to @entity88 as an @entity90 attack helicopter pilot			1

@entity4 told his weekly radio call - in show that the @entity13 has nothing to worry about as he will be with the prince the entire time
