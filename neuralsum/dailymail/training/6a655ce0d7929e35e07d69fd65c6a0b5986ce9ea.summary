a shape emerges under the murky green waters as a whale slowly glides , oblivious to the gasps of awe and camera clicks above it			2
soon it is joined by another and the sound of shutter clicks resonate in the still , calm air			0
this was the special moment a group of lucky sightseers encountered the massive humpback whales of @entity17			2
once in a lifetime : the whale sighting was a ' spiritual occasion ' for sightseers on a whale watching excursion unaware of the fuss surrounding their appearance , the whales continue to swim calmly			2
furiously taking photographs , the tourists are mesmerised by the graceful movements of the cetaceans as they approach the boat			0
the pair of friendly humpback whales seem to have no fear of the boatload of watchers and swim ever closer to the vessel			1
gasps of awe are heard as they experience the rare moment			2
@entity42 , the owner of @entity43 who organised the whale watching , spoke to @entity45 about the experience			1
' people on the boat had never seen a whale before and all of a sudden you have these whales going right up to the boat , ' mr @entity42 said of the encounter			1
up close and personal : many of the tourists had not seen a whale before , let alone this close up more videos of the encounter have since emerged on @entity60 , uploaded by the sightseers on the tour the whales were spotted off the @entity64 near @entity43 in @entity17 ' it 's a bit of a spiritual occasion			1
it puts us in our place a little bit			0
' according to mr @entity42 , the whales behaved rather unusually , swimming around the vessel for the next few hours			1
he told the @entity17 news agency that the group spotted a large pod of at least ten transient killer whales in the distance			1
mr @entity42 believed the humpbacks were intentionally avoiding the orcas			1
' if you look at the end of the video , i took the @entity84 's of the whales , ' he said			2
' you can actually see the bottom edge of one of the tail flukes had teeth marks on it			0
' obviously this whale had an experience with killer whales before			0
' mr @entity42 said this experience was among one of his best whale watching tours ' you see this kind of stuff once in a while , not very often , ' he said			1
' to actually experience it â€“ everybody was just totally in awe			1
