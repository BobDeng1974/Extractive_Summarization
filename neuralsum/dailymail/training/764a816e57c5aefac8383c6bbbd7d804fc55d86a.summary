traditional @entity1 rituals like eating a takeaway in front of the tv , or driving the short distance to work are killing us and need to be challenged			2
greater public health interventions , similar to the smoking ban , are vital if society is to wage war on rising obesity levels , and combat related diseases including cancer , heart disease and diabetes			1
smoking and drinking alcohol are social habits that must be tackled by public health officials			1
a team of social scientists believe , only by making certain unhealthy lifestyle choices socially unacceptable , will progress be made			0
dr @entity24 , a lecturer in social sciences at @entity26 said some social practices reinforce each other , such as getting a takeaway and watching tv on a friday night			1
legislation outlawing smoking in public places means a packet of cigarettes no longer goes hand in hand with a visit to a pub or restaurant			2
a similar approach , with social practice at the heart of public health policy , could be taken to eating and exercise , he said			1
this is instead of traditional methods which rely on persuading people to make the ' right ' decision by going to the gym or eating their five - a - day			0
these treat such decisions as matters of personal choice , ignoring the fact social habits and practices are blindly leading us into bad health			2
dr @entity24 said : ' smoking , exercise and eating are fundamentally social practices , therefore we need to reshape what is deemed socially acceptable and normal in order to change them			1
' it is about shifting the emphasis			0
an example is the way having a friday night takeaway watching the tv has become the social norm , whereas encouraging people to acquire the skills to cook fresh food themselves may dissuade them from this regular routine			0
' also , some people find cooking very enjoyable and it becomes part of the family evening and entertainment , rather than a chore , making fast food less socially acceptable			0
' with cycling initiatives the government can also persuade people that getting on their bike to work is actually a better and safer way to travel , rather than driving through cities			0
' the smoking legislation is a good example where attitudes and behaviour have changed , without the product actually being banned			0
' research last year found the average @entity1 person now forks out £ 110 a month on takeaway meals - a staggering £ 1,320 a year			0
schemes encouraging cycling to work instead of driving , or cooking at home instead of getting a takeaway may be more effective than assuming people will make the ' right ' decision about their health , they said men have the biggest taste for fast food			2
they get through an extraordinary 151 takeaways a year , while the figure for women is 126			0
writing in the journal @entity132 , dr @entity133 and colleagues said new ideas are needed to tackle non communicable , or ' lifestyle ' , diseases			0
they cite the smoking ban as an example of a measure that effectively decoupled the relationship between going out for a meal or a drink and having a cigarette			1
dr @entity24 added : ' current public health policy is dominated by the presumption that individuals are capable of making ' better ' choices for themselves on the basis of information given to them by the government or other agencies			1
' this does not account for the fact that practices like those of smoking and eating have histories of their own			2
' trying to get individuals to stop smoking or eat healthily overlooks the fact that these are fundamentally social practices			1
' public health policy will have to find the courage to break away from its traditional mould if it is to stand a chance of confronting the grim reaper of lifestyle diseases			1

dr @entity24 is a lecturer in social sciences at @entity26
we need to challenge social norms like drinking and eating junk , he said
but these are social practices so *preaching* about being healthy wo *n't* work
smoking ban helped break the relationship between the pub and smoking
public health officials need to bring in similar *innovations* , he argues
rising obesity levels causes rise in cancer , heart disease and diabetes
