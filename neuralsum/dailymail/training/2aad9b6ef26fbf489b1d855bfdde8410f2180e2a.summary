@entity0 have announced that they will be showing @entity3 's @entity2 quarter - final clash against @entity4 for free after the @entity5 snubbed the @entity7 club for a second time			1
the last - eight tie will be played on saturday march 7 and will be available for everyone to watch on btsport.com and on the @entity12 tv platform			1
the @entity5 again rejected the opportunity to show @entity3 live on tv despite coming in for criticism after they did not air the @entity17 giant killing over @entity19 opposition @entity18			1
@entity20 ( centre ) fires @entity3 ahead against @entity18 as they set up @entity2 quarter - final @entity23 ( right ) seals the tie with a neat finish to complete the @entity2 fifth round giant killing @entity3 players celebrate as they beat @entity19 side @entity18 2 - 0 at @entity30 @entity3 vs @entity4 - march 7 , 12:45 kick - off live on @entity0 1 @entity33 v @entity34 - march 7 , 17.30 kick - off live on @entity5 @entity38 v @entity36 - march 8 , 16.00 kick - off live on @entity0 1 @entity41 v @entity42 - march 9 , 19.45 kick - off live on @entity5 @entity44 , head of @entity0 , said : ' the excitement of the @entity2 continues on @entity0 and we have two fantastic quarter - finals on the channel			1
' this will be the second time that @entity0 have shown @entity3 in this year 's @entity2 and because @entity3 have been very passionate about the @entity51 seeing their amazing club run , @entity0 have decided to make the game against @entity4 available to everyone to watch , online , via @entity55 and @entity12			1
' the @entity5 had first and third pick of the last - eight matches and understandably plumped for @entity41 's clash with @entity42 at @entity59 as first choice			2
@entity0 , who are sharing @entity2 coverage with the @entity5 , opted to show @entity38 against @entity36 as their first pick , and the @entity5 have ignored @entity3 's match in favour of the @entity66 between @entity33 and @entity34			1
@entity67 said that the @entity5 had to choose the live games before @entity3 's opponents were known @entity23 joked during his post-match interview that the tie against @entity18 should have been shown on tv @entity73 and @entity67 were subject to a cheeky tweet from @entity3 following their @entity2 win the decision not to show @entity78 's fifth - round tie led to supporters chanting ' are you watching @entity5 ? ' and goalscorer @entity23 even joked that the game ' should have been on tv ' during his post-match interview , and the @entity5 risked further backlash by ignoring the club once more			1
@entity86 presenter @entity67 on sunday night moved to clarify why the @entity5 had not shown @entity3 's win over @entity18			1
' i do have an answer on that subject , ' the presenter said			0
' and it comes from the @entity5 football management who say the following : " they had to pick their live games before the replays were played in the fourth round and therefore could nâ€™t be sure who @entity3 would be at home to			1
if they had been allowed to wait they would have chosen it "			0
' the @entity5 's football editor later released a statement explaining how selections for @entity2 matches are made			1
the tv match selections for the 5th round of the @entity2 caused a bit of a reaction yesterday , so i wanted to use this post to explain in a bit more detail how the selection process works			2
you still might not agree with our picks , particularly if you 're from @entity3 , but hopefully you 'll see there 's a bit of logic to what we try to do			2
as @entity73 mentioned yesterday , the hardest thing is that both the @entity5 and @entity0 have to make our selections before the outcome of replays			2
that 's the only reason why @entity129 's side did n't get a live match this time round			0
we had to weigh up the options and given @entity18 's recent form , thought it was a realistic possibility of the match being @entity7 against a @entity136 side			2
in this case it would n't have been much of a shock whatever the result and the winners would be guaranteed a live quarter - final , as @entity4 have done by progressing at @entity143			1
if @entity3 definitely had a home tie against @entity19 opposition we certainly would have chosen to have the match live on @entity5			1
that has been a big part of our policy so far , showing @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and tonight @entity152 , all looking to overcome opposition from the top flight			0
as the game unfolded yesterday at @entity30 , we shared the frustration of fans and would have loved to have been broadcasting the match live			0
it 's everything the @entity2 and our new comprehensive coverage is about			2
we are speaking to the fa about whether we can change this in the future , but understand it 's tricky for them			0
clubs understandably want to get plans for ticketing , policing and fans in place without waiting for 10 days for tv companies to confirm their selections			0
but we hope there 's a middle ground where we can get a little more flexibility to ensure we have as much chance as possible of capturing cup classics like yesterday			0
of course a lot of things are easy in hindsight			0
we have been really pleased with most of our picks so far and really fortunate to get some proper cup shocks			0
@entity183 from the eighth tier overcoming @entity185 , @entity186 winning in dramatic fashion at @entity188 , @entity149 running @entity38 close and @entity150 holding @entity41 under the @entity191 lights			0
it 's also great to see the difference the tv money can make to these clubs , as well as placing them in the national spotlight with over 7 million viewers tuning in			0
our audience research also suggests that fans want to enjoy a mix of these @entity203 matches and games involving @entity19 sides			0
for those who ca n't afford subscription to sports channels , it 's been great to be able to see live international stars like @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 , all as part of the licence fee			0
while the @entity33 vs. @entity221 game was n't everyone 's cup of tea , it was a hotly contested @entity225 derby with both clubs picking full strength sides and produced a cracking second half watched by over 4 million			0
of course , we would have loved to have been live at @entity229 in the 4th round and @entity3 in the 5th , but the good news for fans is that even when a game is n't shown live there 's always comprehensive @entity86 highlights available			1
there 's a lot more extra coverage devoted to the @entity2 on the @entity5 , with lots of additional content and different ways to enjoy it			1
after the 4th round , 26 million people had watched the coverage on the @entity5 , that 's 8 million more than on terrestrial tv this time last season			2
it 's not all about viewing figures and ratings , but it 's pleasing to be able to bring coverage of the world 's most loved cup competition to such a wide audience			0
despite some of the criticism coming out of @entity3 , a lot of thought goes into the matches we pick , and i hope the selections outlined above show we are particularly keen to showcase clubs outside the @entity19			2
i 'm a @entity265 fan myself so know all too well what the cup can mean to those outside the elite			0
when we sit down tomorrow morning to pick our two matches for the quarter - final we will take all i 've discussed into consideration , but the good news is that all four matches will be live on tv			1
that means @entity3 's incredible heroics over the last five rounds have guaranteed them a money - spinning quarter - final game and boy do @entity17 fans deserve it !			1

@entity3 take on @entity4 in the last eight of the @entity2 on march 7
@entity0 will show the game for free on their *website* and @entity290 platform
the @entity5 rejected the chance to show @entity3 's quarter - final tie
@entity5 were criticised for not airing club 's fifth round win over @entity18
