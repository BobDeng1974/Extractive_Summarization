but at just four foot wide , and far too narrow to fit a car down , it was unlikely any motorists were going to risk a ticket down this lane			1
this ' ridiculous ' set of double yellow lines , painted by bungling council workers on a @entity20 lane , have now been covered over after complaints from residents			1
@entity23 became was branded a laughing stock when the lines appeared earlier this year			2
a ' ridiculous ' set of double yellow lines were painted by council workers on a @entity30 lane which is too narrow to drive down the council blamed the gaffe on contractors , incredibly saying the workers had forgotten ' just how big cars actually are '			1

the council blamed the gaffe on contractors , incredibly saying the workers had forgotten ' just how big cars actually are '			2
a spokesman for the council has now confirmed the yellow lines have now been covered over in black paint			2
they said : ' the lines will be burnt off , but in the meantime they have been painted over as a temporary measure			0
' the yellow lines were in a lane so narrow a man struggles to walk in the space in between them ( left ) and ( right ) resident @entity61 in the lane , now the council has ' erased them ' using black paint @entity65 , the owner of @entity66 near the alleyway double yellow lines in @entity30 , previously described the gaffe as ' one of the stupidest things i 've ever seen			1
' he said : ' when me and my mate saw it we were just laughing our heads off			0
it 's a waste of time , waste of money and waste of material			0
' the only thing you could get down there would be a bike and no - one is going to leave a bike parked up there			0
' they have painted down all the alleys around here			0
i can see why , because emergency vehicles need to get through and there is no room if there are parked cars			0
' this is ridiculous though			0
