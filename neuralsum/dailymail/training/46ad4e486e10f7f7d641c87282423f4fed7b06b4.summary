an audio tape of @entity1 released on wednesday confirmed longstanding reports that he ' could have killed ' @entity4 but decided not to because he was concerned about civilian casualties in @entity6 , @entity7			1
the audio recording , made with @entity1 's permission by former president of @entity13 's @entity12 @entity11 and released to @entity14 by @entity15 , reveals @entity1 telling the former @entity13 politician and more than two dozen @entity13 businessman about the missed opportunity during a visit to @entity13 several months after the end of his presidency			1
the conversation eerily took place the day before the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks masterminded by @entity4			1
' @entity4 -- he 's a very smart guy			2
i 've spent a lot of time thinking about him , and i nearly got him once , ' @entity1 can be heard saying in the recording			2
and i could have gotten , i could have killed him , but i would have to destroy a little town called @entity6 in @entity7 and kill 300 innocent women and children			0
' ' and then i would have been no better than him , ' @entity1 said			2
' and so i did n't do it			0
' @entity6 is the spiritual home of the @entity38 , and it became the physical home of @entity4 during @entity1 's second term as president			1
@entity4 was believed to be living at a compound in @entity6 called @entity43 at the time			2
@entity1 's account of the abandoned @entity4 mission matches up with a 2004 @entity48 report that showed the @entity1 administration had eyes on @entity4 in the 2000 and in a 2005 book that claimed @entity1 once has the chance to take out @entity4 but did n't			1
during the 9/11 investigation @entity48 obtained a secret , @entity56 video of @entity43 taken by @entity57 in the fall of 2000			0
the images in the video are difficult to make out to the untrained eye , but an intelligence analyst for @entity48 said the video shows a man roughly the same height as @entity4 in white robes walking around the compound protected by guards			2
the @entity48 report indicated that all intelligence suggested the man in the video was @entity4 and questioned why the government did n't kill him at that time			0
' we were not prepared to take the military action necessary , ' retired gen. @entity75 , who ran counter-terror efforts for the @entity78 administration , told @entity48			0
@entity4 , was later killed in a @entity80 raid in 2011 , but not before carrying out the deadly september , 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people the same incident was the subject of @entity87 winning author @entity86 's 2005 book @entity88 and rehashed in journalist @entity90 's @entity89 bestselling book - @entity91 : the @entity92 of how the @entity93 into a @entity94 - four years after @entity48 's report			1
in @entity91 , @entity96 summarizes @entity86 's reporting , explaining that through the use of predator drones , @entity4 ' could be watched as he walked through the primitive , undefended , mud - walled compound he and his terrorist associates and their families inhabited in the bleak , sage - brush - strewn plains outside of @entity6 , @entity7			2
' the video imagery was so exquisitely detailed , @entity106 officials viewing the videotapes at the @entity56 and @entity108 could make out a lone child â€™s swing hanging in the compound , ' she wrote			0
' the robed man seemed to present an irresistible target for missile attack			0
but the swing haunted @entity1			0
' the swing suggested innocent children lived there , ' she noted			0
' the @entity106 , for all of its military prowess , was a hamstrung @entity123 in the face of lilliputian terrorists willing to sacrifice innocent lives in a way no civilized nation could			0
' previous reporting on @entity1 's hesitancy to kill @entity4 also indicates that the former president was pressured by then - attorney general @entity132 not to use deadly force to capture terrorist targets			1
the @entity56 had ' no written word nor verbal order to conduct a lethal action ' mission against @entity4 before the september 11 terrorist attack , a @entity1 administration official told the @entity141 in 2004			1
' the objective was to render this guy to law enforcement			0
' a record of @entity1 's paid speeches shows that @entity1 was in fact in @entity13 on the day that @entity15 , the @entity13 businessman who released the tape , says the audio of @entity1 was recorded			1
a comprehensive list of @entity1 's speeches published by the @entity141 shows that @entity1 was paid $ 150,000 by @entity153			1
ltd. to give remarks on sept. 10 , 2001 in @entity155 , which confirms @entity15 's account			1
during his interview with @entity14 , @entity15 said he kept the audio tape secret until now because he simply forgot about it			0
it was not until last week , when @entity1 was back in @entity13 for the opening of @entity160 in @entity161 , that @entity15 said he remembered the conversation .			1

@entity1 made the remarks in front of a *group* of @entity13 businessman on september 10 , 2001
in the audio recording @entity1 says he ' could have killed ' @entity4 but decided not to because *hundreds* of civilians would have also died
@entity1 's account matches up with previously *unconfirmed* reports
