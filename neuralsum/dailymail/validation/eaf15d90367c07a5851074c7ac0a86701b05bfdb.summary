her tv programmes have shown the nation how to create a beautiful home from treasured items that have been handed down through the generations or upcycled and recycled to find a new use			1
and now @entity7 has opened the door to her own @entity9 , @entity10 , house to show she really does practice what she preaches			1
from the living room sofa that has been inherited , to the kitchen tops that were once used in a science lab , the wardrobe now used as kitchen storage and the fireplace that once caused her to burst into tears , miss @entity7 's home is full of quirky collects			1
she and her partner @entity34 bought their @entity10 house , a 1950s property , in september 2006 , a few months after her first son @entity38 , now nine , was born and set about turning it into a home			1
talking about her house , which was once two flats which have been knocked together to create an open and airy family home , @entity45 , 43 , who also has a son @entity47 , seven , and is step - mother to @entity34 's two sons , said : ' i ca n't think of anything that has n't got some sort of story behind it			1
' someone asked me if i designed all this , but it 's not like that			1
it comes together over time			1
you get things all the time and you are adding and taking things away			1
' here miss @entity7 who will be hosting @entity64 , sponsored by @entity65 , later this year in september , shows how she has brought them all together to create a unique living space for her family			1
@entity7 's husband @entity34 bought the kitchen worktops from a school science lab , above @entity7 's sofa , above , is on its way out as according to the tv star it ' has got a huge tear in it ' living room sofa ' that sofa has now got a huge tear in it			1
they are so old these sofas			1
@entity34 got them years ago , before he met me even			1
they were n't always here			1
he does n't like buying new sofas so we just sort of move things around			1
but i am actually going to have to basically get either a new sofa or swap this for another type of sofa soon			1
' ' once you know you 're not going to just buy something new , once you 've made that decision – and i hate calling it an ethical decision because that makes it sound like you are really up your own bottom , but we have made an active decision not to go out and buy new things			1
that decision has been made			1
' the ' @entity107 ' fire place ' i was pregnant with my first child and @entity34 took me to the @entity109 and there was this fireplace that he loved			1
i burst into tears because i just did n't know what else to do			2
it was a disgraceful performance on my behalf			2
' i wept " please no , let 's not buy that fireplace " '			2
i was so ashamed at my lack of backbone			2
" i really do n't think we should buy this fireplace " , i kept saying			2
i was so ashamed of myself			2
' i bought the fireplace for a lot of money			2
i said to @entity34 " i 've bought the fireplace , when you have a building which needs a new fireplace and everything else , you can put it in and you are bound to need it at some point			2
i 'm sorry i cried , it 's a beautiful fireplace			2
i just do n't want it in my home			1
" ' @entity7 admits she ' wept ' when she first bought the fireplace above , as she ' did n't want it in her home ' ' then we were moving in here but it was n't ready by the time @entity38 was born so i went down and stayed in @entity142 for a bit and @entity34 came up during the week to supervise the works			1
when i came back from @entity142 , there was the fireplace … ' ' my mum used to call it the @entity107 fireplace			2
the one thing i dread is that he finds whatever is missing from the middle bit			2
it 's some @entity155 - awful piece of brass and i hope he does n't ever stumble across it			2
' no , but i 'm very fond of it now			2
it 's very baronial , i think that 's the word			2
for a while there was a glass sword hung up there on a nail			2
i 've taken it down now			2
and look , there 's an invitation to an event in 2014 up here			2
that 's how often i sort it out			2
' kitchen when they bought the flat downstairs , they had a reshuffle of rooms and turned a bedroom into the kitchen and made it open plan with what is now the dining room			1
they kept most of the kitchen furniture such as the worktops and the aga			0
' these worktops are from a school science lab. @entity34 got hold of them			0
look , if you look closely you can still see the marks where the old @entity194 burners would have been attached , ' sats @entity7			1
the larder and things inside there are all sorts of useful bits and bobs in the larder			1
@entity7 says : ' it 's not looking so tidy at the moment because we 've just shoved things in here			1
my sister always says she wants to be here in a nuclear winter			0
you could live off this for a long time			0
' inside , there is a wicker basket with separate compartments for bottles which she bought recently in @entity217			0
@entity7 explains : ' this is apple juice from @entity142 , from home			1
we 've got an orchard			0
there 's a place just up the hill that has a big apple press			0
you pick the apples , take them up there , they press it and sent it back to you and you keep the bottles for the next time			0
' i 'm a big picnic person			0
i bought these ( huge silver flasks from stews etc ) back from @entity235			0
there , 46 per cent of people do n't have running water			0
so the supermarkets have loads of picnic stuff			0
' they have loads of family gatherings with lots of picnic stuff			0
you can put a stew in there			0
some people on twitter said ' nobody has winter picnics … but they are absolutely brilliant			0
@entity7 's larder is so full , above , that her sister jokes she wants to be there in a nuclear winter @entity7 , who is dyslexic , points out a sign she wrote with a spelling error : ' please keep the larder this way , @entity262 ' ' [ in here is ] @entity34 's deep fat fryer			1
he 's not allowed to switch it on in the house			0
he has to go and plug it in outside by the bbq			0
it stinks - the smell of deep fat frying - you can never get it out			0
' actually , it needs a bit of a tidy up in here			0
it 's not as tidy as it usually is			0
' she points to a small picnic basket with jubilee design : ' this is my pride and joy			0
do you remember the royal concert for the jubilee ? well we had a couple of tickets and everyone there got their own picnic basket			0
' ' the brilliant thing about this room is that is keeps everything in it			0
' there 's hot chocolate from @entity305			0
when we go we always drive and we pick it up from the co-op there			0
' i made this sign when the larder was nice and tidy and then i managed to write ' thak you ' on the sign			1
look at that , ' thak you ' [ @entity7 has dyslexia ]			1
the wardrobe in the kitchen ' we bought that together actually and it works incredibly well			0
again , i think kitchen storage is incredibly important			0
we had to take careful measurements to make sure it would fit under that beam , ' says @entity7			1
@entity326 thing on top of the fridge next to wardrobe @entity7 says : ' i bought that in @entity331 when i was on my own			1
if i buy things on my own , it always gets shifted all over the house and @entity34 never accepts that he likes it			1
' @entity7 loves her kitchen wardrobe , above , and says that she thinks kitchen storage is very important the new fridge ' this is my new fridge			1
i 've had three second hand fridges			1
if someone buys one of @entity34 's buildings we just have them from there so we never throw them out			0
the light in the fridge kept tripping the other day and our housekeeper said " oh , be careful , the fridge was giving everybody electric shocks , " ' so i said : " no , that 's enough ! i want a new fridge ! " this is new , new , new , sparkly new			0
look at the ice tray , everything is there			0
@entity363 , there 's lamb in the freezer there from @entity142			0
we have our own sheep down there			0
it 's a great layout , i 'd recommend it to anyone			0
' we are really lucky			0
i earn a fortune , @entity34 earns a fortune			0
we are not buying things second hand because we ca n't afford to			1
and we are not pretending to			0
we could n't have second hand fridges because we could n't afford them , it 's just that @entity34 did n't want to waste a perfectly good one just because you did n't pick it			1
in a way , because you take time to make decision over things , it takes time to sort things out			1
