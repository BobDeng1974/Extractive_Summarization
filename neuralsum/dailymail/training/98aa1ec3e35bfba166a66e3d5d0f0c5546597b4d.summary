most atms serve the purpose of fattening our wallets but a new take on the facility looks set to fatten our waistlines instead			1
@entity8 bakery @entity7 , which launched a cupcake @entity10 , is bringing the device to the @entity12 so that shoppers can get a sugary fix at all hours of the day			1
the @entity16 company , which is said to be considering a number of different locations in @entity19 to install the machine , churned out up to 1,000 cupcakes a day when it opened the same facility in @entity23 - and even reported that the machine crashed because of high demand			1
@entity36 , head of marketing at @entity7 , explained that the machines can hold up to 600 cupcakes , and any cake dispensed will have only been baked a couple of hours earlier			1
she told @entity41 t the time of the @entity23 launch : ' the machine is attached to our bakery , which is essentially a 24 - hour operation			2
by the time our closers leave at night , it ’s 11pm and our bakers arrive in the wee hours of the morning ( 2 or 3am ! )			2
famous fans : @entity7 is a favourite with the a-list including @entity54 ( pictured at a store in 2008 , left ) , @entity56 ( centre ) and @entity58 ( right ) ' we ’ll constantly be restocking the automat with freshly baked cupcakes so the cupcake you receive will only have been baked a couple hours earlier			1
whether the @entity19 machine will stock cakes for dogs too , like its @entity23 counterpart is as yet unconfirmed			1
sprinkles in @entity23 decided to stock the pet treats because health department regulations do not permit dogs in the bakery she explained , ' so you do n’t have to tie up @entity75 while you head inside			0
' @entity7 is as famous in its @entity77 birthplace for its a-list fans as it is its buttercream - frosted treats			1
popular : @entity7 , which has outposts in @entity23 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 , is as famous for its a-list fans as it is its buttercream - frosted treats @entity54 , @entity56 and the @entity58 sisters have all been spotted in its stores ( though quite how they eat cupcakes and maintain those bodies is anyone 's guess )			1
and since the great @entity93 @entity92 hit screens , cupcakes are certainly in fashion on this side of the pond too			2
cakes , in flavours such as cinnamon sugar and chocolate coconut , sell for $ 3.50 each ( £ 2.15 ) or $ 39 per dozen ( £ 24 ) in the @entity102 , and prices are likely to be similar when the cakes launch in the @entity12			1
so prepare those waistlines because it is only a matter of time before cupcake atms hit the @entity12			1
@entity108 , pictured , has been trained by @entity109			0
personal trainer and nutrition expert @entity109 , who has worked with the likes of @entity108 , right , gives her opinion …			0
' we should have treats occasionally			0
making ' treats ' so easy to access in 24 atm machines may possibly end up ' eating ' away at a persons willpower			0
' in one breath we are hearing the message to cut down on fats , sugars and to eat a healthy diet			0
' he visual message in launching a ' marketed ' atm machine that sells what i can only describe as devil food is not helping people maintain their healthy lifestyle			2
' we all know that too much fat in our diet can lead to heart disease and some cancers			0
' the danger with sugar is similar which , long term can contribute to diabetes , weight gain and also increased visits to the dentist with teeth cavities			0
' it is difficult to put precise figures on the nutritional value of cup cakes without knowing the brand as they can vary quite dramatically			2
' i would say the average cup cake has around 200 to 300 calories adding a further 100 -150 calories for frosting and fillings			0
' a fat content of around 15 -20 grams with sugar levels around the same - not good news for our health or our weight			0
' we all should have treats but i do believe the temptation with these ' marketed ' 24 hour atm machines will tempt and encourage an unhealthy approach to eating habits .			0

@entity7 launched the dispenser in the @entity77 earlier this year and is now bringing the device to @entity12
@entity16 machine churns out over 1,000 cupcakes a day
cakes set to cost around £ 3 each
