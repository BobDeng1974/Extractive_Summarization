by @entity0 last updated at 4:52 pm on 16th december 2011 some would describe it as a @entity3 decision – and it has certainly left the audience feeling @entity6			0
theatregoers watching @entity3 this @entity8 are complaining of being short - changed in more ways than one after producers replaced the dwarfs with child actors to cut costs			1
the children appear on stage wearing masks , but their lines are pre-recorded by adult actors and played to the theatre on a loop while the young performers try to match their movements to the soundtrack			1
the dwarfs have been replaced by children in masks but this has upset some pantomime loved who feel they are being short - changed axed : dwarf actors have been axed from @entity34 's @entity33 's production of @entity3 because they are too expensive			1
child actors , pictured , have stepped into the role instead and audience members are n’t the only ones giving directors short shrift over the move , as dwarfs are furious that the ‘ greedy ’ decision has put them out of work			1
a spokesman for the production at the @entity47 , which stars @entity48 and his wife , former page three girl @entity49 , said the decision was taken because dwarf actors were ‘ very , very expensive ’ and most of the show ’s budget was taken up by special effects			1
but @entity55 , director of @entity56 , an agency specialising in the representation of dwarf actors , complained that the move ‘ destroyed the magic ’ of the classic pantomime			1
mr @entity55 , who is a dwarf himself , added : ‘ it ’s not fair at all – it destroys the magic to have the voices pre-recorded			1
it ’s tradition to have dwarfs in this role , the clue is in the name in the first place			1
‘ i had one guy on our books who was due to perform there			0
i have never heard of a company pre-recording the words that will be spoken by the dwarfs			1
there ’s no way that will seem right			0
‘ i suppose it ’s a sign of the harsh economic times , but there remain plenty of other companies who are able to put on shows with some of our actors in their proper roles			0
’ the wicked queen : former page 3 girl @entity49 is appearing at the @entity90 mr @entity55 admitted dwarf actors command a slight premium over other supporting actors in shows because of the ‘ niche market ’ they operate in			2
he said the cost of hiring a dwarf to appear in the pantomime would be between £ 600 and £ 850 per week , adding : ‘ these guys are trying to earn a living wage			2
@entity34 theatre is stripping small people of their livelihood			1
‘ it ’s not very nice to be exploiting them like this and i hope the general public see this			0
to me this is just plain greedy			2
’ @entity110 entertainment , the company behind the pantomime , would not reveal how much the child actors would be paid for playing the seven dwarfs			2
but over the show ’s six - week run , if each dwarf was paid £ 700 per week the bill would amount to almost £ 30,000			2
in the theatre ’s 2006 production of the same fairytale , seven dwarfs hired from an acting agency did appear			1
the attempt to save cash this year comes despite the theatre breaking its own sales record last year with a different pantomime , which took more than £ 1.1million			2
@entity129 , a director of @entity130 , said the company was still investing ‘ hundreds of thousands of pounds ’ in the theatre ’s annual spectacular			2
he added : ‘ shows have become incredibly expensive as audiences expect amazing effects and sound quality they would get from the stereo in their homes			0
‘ we want the shows to be as fantastic as possible and we spend a lot of money on effects			0
‘ but money is n’t limitless and dwarfs are very , very expensive			1
’ mr @entity129 claimed the children worked ‘ quite well ’ , adding : ‘ with the masks and costumes on they look just like the @entity148 dwarfs			0
’ however , the move has not gone down well with theatregoers			0
one said : ‘ i could go to any amateur production and see children playing dwarfs			0
’ and @entity155 , a 27 - year - old teacher from @entity156 who was planning to go to the performance , said he had now changed his mind			0
he added : ‘ it ’s cutting corners , is n’t it ? i could understand it at a school pantomime but not in a big theatre			0
it ’s a bit of a rip - off			0

theatre in @entity34 says dwarfs are too expensive
