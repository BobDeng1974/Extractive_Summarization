an amphibious surveillance unit in the shape of a ball has been unveiled that can roll over both land and sea			0
known as the @entity7 , the machine can move through mud , sand and snow without getting stuck			1
it ’s creators say it could be used to accompany special operations teams in conflict zones - or even carry explosives to an enemy location			1
called @entity7 it has cameras on either side so it can be steered			1
it is moved using a pendulum system that shifts its centre of gravity @entity29 was created by a research team in @entity31 , @entity32 , and is currently being tested with the @entity33			1
the secret to its efficiency is a patented drive mechanism			0
a controlled pendulum keeps the center of gravity very close to the inside surface of the sphere			1
at rest , the centre of gravity is close to the ground			2
to create momentum , a built - in motor raises the pendulum			2
this changes the center of gravity and @entity49 begins to roll in the direction that the pendulum has been moved			1
not only does it take very little energy to drive @entity49 , but virtually no noise is generated either			0
so @entity49 moves around without drawing attention to itself			0
source : @entity56 according to @entity58 , the machine can swim over water at about four miles ( six kilometres ) per hour , as its low density allows it to float			0
it can then roll along a beach at up to a 30 degree incline at 20 miles ( 32km ) per hour			0
it weighs just 55lbs ( 25kg ) , with cameras on board allowing a remote driver to see where they are going			2
the spherical design allows for its interior to be protected , with sand or even dangerous gas unable to get inside to damage the electronics			0
it runs on a rechargeable battery , with around eight to 16 hours of activity available depending on the mission profile , and it takes about three to four hours to recharge			1
its cameras give it a 360 - degree field of vision , while it can carry cargo weighing up to 4.4lbs ( two kilograms )			2
according to @entity7 , the design was originally intended to be used for a space planetary mission on @entity85 - but has since been repurposed for use on @entity87			2
according to @entity89 , the machine can swim over water ( shown ) at about four miles ( six kilometres ) per hour , as its low density allows it to float its cameras ( left ) give it a 360 - degree field of vision , while it can carry cargo weighing up to 4.4lbs ( 2kg )			0
it can roll along the ground at up to a 30 degree incline at 20 miles ( 32km ) per hour ( right ) the spherical design allows for its interior to be protected , while sand or even dangerous gas can not get inside to damage the electronics			0
treads on the sphere ( shown ) also help it grip the land when it rolls ‘ @entity7 is the only known spherical unmanned amphibious vehicle systems that can navigate upstream , ’ the company says on their website			1
according to @entity58 , in order to steer it ‘ uses a nine - axis stabilization , “ pendulum motion ” propulsion system , which moves the bot forward by shifting the center of gravity back and forth and a variety of steering algorithms			1
’ amazingly , the whole design is also scalable			0
a @entity7 could be made as small as four inches ( 10cm ) across , and as large as nine feet ( 2.7 metres )			2
the prototype , meanwhile , will be six feet ( 1.8 metres )			0
for now , @entity7 is driven around by a remote operator , but the team ultimately want to make it autonomous so that you can pick a spot on a map , and it can get there by itself .			1

@entity20 company is developing an autonomous drone shaped like a sphere
called @entity7 it has cameras on either side so it can also be steered
it is moved using a pendulum system that shifts the centre of gravity
on one charge it can last up to 16 hours out and about
it could be used to accompany *military* teams or *deliver* explosives
