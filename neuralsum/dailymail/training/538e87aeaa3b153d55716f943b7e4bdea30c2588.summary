' earlier this month , mr @entity47 said his daughter had been enduring the worst pain of the ordeal			0

injuries : @entity7 had her left leg , right foot and both hands amputated			1

' her spirits are extraordinarily high			0
' necrotizing fasciitis , more commonly known as ' flesh - eating disease ' , is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection			0
' @entity209 ' refers to something that causes body tissue to die , and the infection can destroy skin , muscles and fat			0
the disease develops when the bacteria enters the body , often through a minor cut or scrape			2
as the bacteria multiply , they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area			2
because it is so virulent , the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body			2
symptoms include small , red lumps or bumps on the skin , rapidly - spreading bruising , sweating , chills , fever and nausea			0
organ failure and shock are also common complications			0
sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death , and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue			0
amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg			2
patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up , to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons			0
there are 500 to 1,500 cases reported a year , but 20 to 25 percent of victims die			0
