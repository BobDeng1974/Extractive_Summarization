just 51,000 people completed @entity2 applications during the first week the @entity4 website was online , according to two sources inside the @entity6 who gave @entity8 an exclusive look at the earliest enrollment numbers			1
the career civil servants , who process data inside the agency , confirmed independently that just 6,200 @entity15 applied for health insurance through the problem - plagued website on october 1 , the day it first opened to the public			1
neither @entity6 nor the @entity20 would comment on the record about the numbers			2
enroll @entity15 , on @entity25 administration - related organization that aims to help @entity15 sign up , only replied to a request for information a day after this article was first published			1
' i do n’t have any hard numbers beyond what @entity6 and the state - based exchanges have released , ' said spokesman @entity33 , who insisted that @entity15 have been ' enthusiastic ' and ' grateful ' for @entity2			1
the @entity34 did not respond to emails seeking comment			0
but several administration officials have claimed this month that they did n't have access to the kinds of raw figures @entity8 obtained from the people who work for them			1
and the anemic totals suggest a far lower level of interest in coverage through the @entity2 than the @entity25 administration has hoped to see			1
' ' the @entity34 and @entity6 have continually claimed they did not have these figures , ' @entity62 told @entity8			2
' if they do , they have misled the @entity79 and the @entity15 people			0
' the low numbers also reflect a level of technological frustration on the part of @entity15 whose attempts to investigate their new health insurance options have been met with crashes , error messages and interminable delays			2
@entity91 host @entity90 agreed on wednesday that the @entity34 should consider granting @entity64 ' demands for a one - year delay of the rule requiring individual taxpayers to buy insurance , given the failings of the glitch - prone enrollment website that has produced more headaches than new customers			2
‘ if they were n’t fully ready , they should accept the advice that a lot of @entity64 are giving them , ' @entity90 said			0
' delay it another year , get it ready , and make sure it works ' ' i do n't know ' : @entity6 secretary @entity109 said on @entity110 that she had n't seen @entity2 enrollment numbers @entity25 was passionate on launch day , saying in a @entity114 ceremony that millions of @entity15 would benefit from the @entity2			1
but so far those numbers have seemed far out of reach the open enrollment period for @entity2 coverage is slated to last for six months			1
if the first week 's total were an indication of how many @entity15 will sign up during that time through the @entity25 administration 's website , its final tally would reach a paltry 1.32 million			1
@entity4 provides enrollment services for @entity15 in 36 states ; the remaining 14 states and the @entity128 , which operate enrollment programs in their own exchanges , represent 33.7 per cent of the @entity15 population , according to census projections			1
if the state - run exchanges were to have a similar response rate for six months , the national enrollment total would be approximately 2 million			1
that number is less than 29 per cent of the 7 million the @entity25 administration would need , according to the nonpartisan @entity139 , in order to balance the new health insurance system 's books and keep it from financial collapse			1
' the administration ’s goal is seven million people in the first year , ' @entity149 president @entity148 , a long - time @entity2 opponent , told @entity8			1
' we are not on track for anything like seven million			0
@entity153 was retired for being a smaller disappointment			0
' ' there was no good reason to hide these number , ' he said			0
' this is not keeping a secret from the @entity161 or the @entity162			0
... why lie about this , for crying out loud ? ' ' these numbers reflect what we all know : @entity2 is a disaster , ' @entity63 @entity167 sen. @entity167 told @entity8			1
' it is time for the president to admit @entity2 is not working and that the @entity15 people deserve better			2
' spokespersons for five different @entity173 senators declined to provide comment , with most saying they are paying greater attention to the debt - ceiling and government - shutdown standoffs that have gripped @entity128 since before oct. 1			2
' these numbers reflect what we all know , ' said @entity182 senator @entity167 ( c )			0
' @entity2 is a disaster			0
' rep. @entity62 , an outspoken @entity184 , said everyone who has used the federal government 's website to enroll in @entity2 would fit in a single small town in his legislative district @entity191 chair @entity190 , a @entity192 @entity64 , said the small enrollment numbers are a symptom of a larger problem			1
' far more people have been unable to complete their applications because of crashing websites or impossible wait times than have successfully enrolled , ' said @entity190			0
' meanwhile , the clock is ticking and the window for open enrollment gets smaller every day			2
' they 've lost @entity90 : @entity91 personality @entity90 , who seldom aligns himself with @entity64 , said wednesday that the @entity34 should give @entity64 the @entity2 delay they seek , if only to give tech issues time to sort themselves out @entity190 said wednesday during a committee hearing on @entity207 that ' in just the past decade , the federal government cancelled at least fifteen major it projects after wasting $ 10 billion on their development			0
but none of those costly mistakes were anywhere near as big or complex , as @entity2			0
' the @entity34 aims to see the health care exchanges enroll at least 2.7 million young , healthy people between the ages of 18 and 35 , whose monthly premiums are needed to offset the cost of health care for older , sicker @entity15			2
it 's unclear how many of the early enrollees fall in that age group			0
a projected enrollment total of 2 million would also represent just 4 per cent of the overall number who could participate			2
' more than 50 million @entity15 qualify for the @entity2 exchanges , ' @entity230 vice president @entity229 pointed out , claiming that ' this paltry response is a clear rejection of the system			1
' it remains possible , according to the sources who provided the enrollment data , that overall rates of enrollment will tick up after the much - maligned healthcare.gov website is retrofitted with technology fixes that allow more @entity15 to navigate it smoothly			1
@entity34 press secretary @entity242 drew criticism on monday after he boasted that website response times were cut by one - third after the @entity20 implemented virtual ' waiting rooms ' that allowed users to trickle in according to the load the government 's servers could handle			0
another flood of customers could hypothetically come in after jan. 1 , the sources said , if a significant number of private employers cancel their employee benefit plans and dump their workers into the @entity2 's health care exchanges			1
' you should ask @entity6			0
i do n't have a number , ' said @entity34 press secretary @entity242 on oct. 4 , when reporters quizzed him on @entity2 enrollment numbers treasury secretary @entity263 said sunday on @entity264 that ' it 's obviously not my primary area of responsibility ' to know how many @entity2 enrollees have clicked the error - prone ' submit ' button the availability of raw @entity2 enrollment numbers will come as an embarrassment to the @entity25 administration , since its public faces have insisted that such figures are unknown or unknowable			1
@entity242 reiterated on monday that the administration would ' release enrollment data on regularly , monthly intervals			0
' ' i 'm not sure when that begins , ' he told reporters , ' but i 'm sure we 'll let you know in plenty of time so you can plan and put it on your calendar			0
' ' the clock is ticking , ' says rep. @entity190 , ' and the window for open enrollment gets smaller every day ' that night , @entity291 host @entity290 asked @entity6 secretary @entity109 on ' @entity110 ' how many @entity15 had enrolled in @entity2			1
' i ca n't tell you , ' the secretary answered , ' because i do n't know			0
' an unnamed senior @entity34 official told @entity91 host @entity296 on monday that the administration would start releasing numbers after november 1 , and would combine data from healthcare.gov with those from more than a dozen states that run their own health insurance exchanges , in order ' to have a good picture of what 's happening across the country			1
' sen. @entity309 , the feisty @entity310 standard - bearer who led a lengthy quasi-filibuster last month that raised the profile of what republicans say are @entity2 's legal and philosophical shortcomings , said thursday that ' every day our concerns are validated as we learn more about how the law ca n’t deliver on its promises			1
' ' the law has failed on every single measure , ' @entity309 told @entity8			0
' it does not make healthcare more affordable or accessible			0
' @entity327 national coordinator @entity326 said thursday that the @entity2 enrollment numbers were unlikely to keep pace with the numbers of @entity15 who are losing their insurance as the program goes into effect			1
' over 800,000 people in @entity337 alone have lost their current health insurance in the last month , ' @entity335 said , ' yet nationwide only 51,000 people have received health insurance from @entity2			2
the numbers just do not add up			0
' overlaid on top of @entity2 's rocky launch has been a partial government shutdown whose broad personnel layoffs have compounded what was already a difficult rollout			2
on wednesday a press spokesperson who answered a @entity6 press line told @entity8 to allow at least 24 hours for a comment – one which never came anyway			2
' we 're in furlough status right now , so we 're short - staffed , ' she said			0
' all our requests are going through email			0
drop us a line , and if anyone 's available , they 'll get back to you			0

@entity2 's main signup engine *attracted* just 6,200 new customers on its launch day and 51,000 after the first week
at the same rate , the 6 - month open enrollment period would sign up just 2 million @entity15 , including 14 states and @entity128 , which have their own insurance exchanges
the @entity139 says @entity2 needs at least 7 million customers to stay *afloat* financially
numerous @entity25 administration officials have denied seeing any enrollment figures at all
@entity8 's sources are two @entity6 workers who have access to the data as it 's *crunched*
@entity63 *congressman* says anemic national enrollment numbers are ' roughly the population of a small town in my district '
