by @entity1 reporter last updated at 12:29 pm on 2nd september 2011 a military - style school staffed entirely by ex-servicemen is set to open for deprived children in response to the riots , it has been revealed			1
leading military personnel , including the captain of an elite @entity11 counter-insurgency unit and former chief of defence staff , are establishing a revolutionary ' free school ' , called the @entity14			1
housed in @entity17 barracks in @entity18 , it will have a zero tolerance approach to bad behaviour and will foster academic and sporting competitiveness			1
plans : a military - style school staffed entirely by ex-servicemen is set to open for deprived children in response to the riots , it has been revealed its founders have said they will ' rip - up ' the national curriculum and pupils starting the school , aged 11 , will be taught nothing but literacy and numeracy until they have reached minimum standards in both disciplines			1
high moral standards will be instilled and its teachers will seek to ensure pupils do not leave the school with ' an inflated sense of self - worth '			1
and ' all liberal shibboleth ' ( jargon ) taught at teacher training will be jettisoned			2
the announcement came as @entity48 's first ' free ' schools - the @entity47 , in @entity49 , and @entity52 - @entity51 primary , in @entity53 , opened their doors to pupils			2
free schools , a flagship coalition policy and a cornerstone of @entity60 's @entity59 ethos , are semi-independent state schools set up by parents , teachers , faith groups and other organisations			2
flagship : free schools are a cornerstone of prime minister @entity60 's @entity59 project @entity68 , a primary with 25 per cent of its 120 places still available , is to have a shortened four - week summer holiday and extended opening hours – from 8am to 6pm - to cater for working parents			2
it will follow the national curriculum and focus on academic rigour			1
the @entity78 primary school will give pupils a @entity82 faith - based education , with daily prayers , a vegetarian diet , and the chance for pupils to take part in yoga , meditation and the arts			1
however , its head teacher is a devout @entity92 and half of the pupils it will admit can come from any faith			2
the schools are the first of 24 to open this september and will be followed by dozens more next year			0
the @entity14 school is still at pre-proposal stage and would not open until september 2012 , at the earliest			1
if approved , it is likely to be based in a gothic building , old @entity104 - @entity103 premises in @entity18 which house a disused @entity17 training ground			1
the training ground was gutted by a fire this april			0
the school model is the idea of @entity110 captain @entity109 , of the counter-insurgency unit at @entity112 , who was educated at @entity113			1
captain @entity109 is set to retire this year to set - up the school and hopes to roll - out the model across the @entity110			1
he is developing the model with @entity118 of think - tank the @entity119 and @entity121 , former chief of defence staff			0
as well as scrapping the curriculum @entity109 will scrap all soft , trendy , ' liberal ' teacher training techniques			2
he said in a report : ' the performance of our armed forces in @entity11 and elsewhere stands out in stark contrast to the mobs that have recently been roaming our streets			0
' as important as role models are , they are only part of the picture			0
every liberal shibboleth taught in teacher - training courses will be discarded in favour of proven methods			0
' pupils will not be expected to ' direct their own learning ' - most undergraduates are barely capable of this , and it is folly to expect illiterate and innumerate pupils to do the same			0
' rather , teachers should provide the moral and intellectual guidance that all children want and need			0
' captain @entity109 will also place a strong emphasis on sport and outdoor activities to overcome the problem of attention deficit disorder			0
the school will have a standard admissions policy , recruiting pupils from its catchment area , and students will be encouraged to take rigorous subjects that are needed for entry to elite universities			1
harrow educated @entity121 , who was the chief of defence staff between 1997 and 2001 , said : ' in my experience , those from the toughest and roughest backgrounds often respond most enthusiastically to the disciplines expected by our armed services			0
' so i suspect that the qualities needed by the modern soldier are innate virtues , one which can be drawn out from all of us			0
' but it is clear that too many of our schools are failing to do just that …			0
the aim is to produce good citizens , not good soldiers			0

elite military personnel will ' rip up ' national curriculum
the @entity190 school will be based at barracks in @entity18 and adopt zero tolerance to bad behaviour
