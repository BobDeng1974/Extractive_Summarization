tragedy : @entity1 , 43 , was found hanged in a wooded area close to her home two days before @entity4 a teacher plagued by decades of insomnia killed herself two days before @entity4 after becoming addicted to sleeping tablets she bought online , an inquest has heard			1
@entity1 , 43 , was found hanged in a wooded area close to her home in @entity12 , @entity13 , in the early hours of december 23			1
her heartbroken husband @entity14 said his wife had suffered from insomnia deprivation throughout her adult life and would often go for days without sleep			1
an inquest into to her death was opened and adjourned ahead of a full hearing , but there are believed to be no suspicious circumstances surrounding her death			1
mr @entity14 said the couple had enjoyed a dream wedding on the @entity30 island of @entity31 in 2011 and had battled through her problems together			1
he said he wants to raise awareness about the damage insomnia and the purchase of sleeping tablets without prescription can do			1
he said : ' @entity1 would sometimes go several days without being able to sleep			1
' it would reach a point where she was desperately tired , but still she could not sleep			2
' if she could sleep , it was often during the day , which would cause enormous disruption to her life			2
' it was something she had suffered from since being at school and university			0
' @entity1 tried everything - hypnotherapy , acupuncture and @entity51 ( cognitive behavioural therapy )			2
' unfortunately , she resorted to accessing sleeping tablets , which should only be prescribed by @entity54 , online , and became dependent on them			1
' it 's totally wrong that people can get these things on the internet , but how do you stop it ? ' ultimately , she was taking too many of them and they were making the problem worse			0
but she must have been desperate			0
' she was a beautiful , intelligent and driven woman and what has happened is devastating			0
' tribute : @entity1 's husband @entity67 , pictured together on their wedding day in 2011 , said his ' beautiful and brilliant ' wife was driven to despair by her lack of sleep mr @entity14 , 47 , said he now knows sleep deprivation affects many people in all walks of life , but there is too little publicity about possible cures			1
dependency : the 43 - year - old tried everything to manage her insomnia but then resorted to sleeping pills she bought online ' i have only found out since @entity1 has died that @entity54 often run sleep clinics , specifically for people suffering from insomnia , ' he said			1
' they might have helped			0
it seems insomnia is something even the medical profession seems reluctant to talk about			2
' if anything positive can come out of this , it is that more people must know about insomnia as an issue and how to access coping strategies to combat it			2
' i would urge anyone suffering from such a problem to be assertive with the medical services of getting help			0
' i would also like something to be done about the ease at which people who are desperate can get hold of prescription drugs - containing who knows what - with the click of a button on the internet			2
' in an age when you ca n't even buy more than two packets of paracetamol from a supermarket without being challenged , it is wrong			0
' mrs @entity1 , 43 , was found dead in the wooded area at @entity126 in the @entity128 area of @entity12 , @entity13			1
