@entity8 and @entity9 launched legal action against @entity11 for not respecting their right to be served food and drink in their mother tongue			1
mr @entity18 - also a fluent @entity7 speaker - branded the airline 's employees as ' malicious , oppressive and reprehensible ' for not answering his questions in @entity5			0
@entity18 has failed with a compensation claim against @entity11 after being spoken to @entity7 the couple claimed they did n't get served in @entity5 when they checked in for their flight or at the boarding gate at the airport in the @entity1 capital @entity31			1
they also complained that they ordered a @entity35 drink aboard the plane , but the @entity7 speaking air hostess brought them a sprite instead aboard the flight in july 2009			0
they were initially awarded £ 8,000 in damages in 2010 , but @entity11 appealed and the ruling was overturned			1

' next time mr @entity18 tries his little trick , the airlines should offer him a free case @entity35 , and if that is n't good enough then they should inform him - in both official languages - that he is wasting their time			0
