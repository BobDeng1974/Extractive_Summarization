by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 15:55 est , 13 december 2012 updated : 04:50 est , 14 december 2012 a man accused of raping two @entity4 women in @entity5 has been cleared of all charges after the victims protested his innocence			1
dr @entity9 , 30 , and @entity10 , 63 , were convinced @entity11 was not the man who attacked them			1
mr @entity11 had already spent 18 months behind bars after being wrongly arrested in may 2011			1
victims : @entity11 , who was cleared of rape , with dr @entity9 ( right ) and @entity10 ( middle ) dr @entity9 ( centre ) has struck up a friendship with @entity11 ( left ) , the man accused of raping her			1

the women were assaulted within days of each other in 2010 in almost identical attacks when they were dragged off the same remote beach path and raped in a deserted hotel building			1
but after mr @entity11 was arrested , university researcher dr @entity9 and retired primary school teacher mrs @entity10 told police that he bore no resemblance to their attacker			1
they maintained that their rapist was ten to 15 years younger and had a different voice , build and facial features			2
police claimed they had a confession from mr @entity11 , 47 , something he says was extracted through torture			1
yesterday , dr @entity9 emerged from the courthouse , in the parish of @entity59 , with mr @entity11 by her side			1
criticising the police handling of the case , she said : ' it was a total sham			0
i told the hearing that i am convinced this was not the man who attacked me			1
' i 'm glad the case has been dismissed against mr @entity11 , but there are a lot of questions which still need to be answered			2
i would like to see an investigation into this investigation			0
' @entity74 : mrs @entity10 ' face was bruised and swollen after the attack , which left her with a broken collarbone and ribs dr @entity9 , from @entity79 , @entity29 , moved to @entity5 after studying for a phd in tropical coastal management and holds a research post at the @entity83			0
she said : ' i want to know if mr @entity11 may have even been beaten when his statement was taken by the police			2
the circumstances surrounding the non-existing evidence have to be known and we want them made public			0
' @entity93 mrs @entity10 , speaking from her home in @entity91 , @entity92 , told the @entity94 : ' i am delighted that @entity11 has been cleared and proved that what we have been saying all along is true			2
' but this is only the first step			0
what we want now is for the police in @entity5 to admit they have made a mistake and to say they are going to go all out to find the real culprit			0
' last month mrs @entity10 , who was raped while on holiday , flew to @entity5 to give evidence at one of three preliminary hearings			0
while there , she met mr @entity11 for the first time after the two women helped to secure bail			1
the grandmother said : ' we have been saying for almost two years that they had the wrong man and for that whole time they have ignored us			2
it is so wrong that it has gone on for this long			0
' mr @entity11 , who lived with his mother and brother before his arrest , declined to speak after the ruling yesterday , but spent 30 minutes outside court thanking dr @entity9			2
he has previously thanked the ' very brave ' women for waiving their anonymity and fighting for his release			0
his lawyer described them as ' two very determined @entity131 ladies '			0
mr @entity11 was represented by @entity132 , president of the @entity28 , only after actress @entity133 heard about the case and paid his legal fees			2
meeting : @entity9 ( left ) and @entity10 ( centre ) met @entity11 ( right ) outside the court in @entity22 , @entity5 face - to - face : @entity133 ( left ) also met with @entity11 along with @entity9 and @entity10			2
the three @entity4 women paid for an attorney to represent mr @entity11 mrs @entity21 , 66 , an addiction counsellor , was raped at knifepoint when a masked intruder broke into her @entity5 home in 2004			1
afterwards , she made a formal complaint about the police 's poor attempts to catch her attacker			0
the two latest victims believe police rushed to charge mr @entity11 to limit the damage to the isle 's image as a holiday destination			1
royal @entity5 police commissioner @entity154 said yesterday the force had ' an excellent reputation in the law enforcement community and is highly regarded '			0
he added : ' this is not to say that we never make mistakes			0
on the contrary , on such occasions it is our policy to admit our failings			0
' to suggest that we put the reputation of our country before the welfare and comfort of our visitors is utterly wrong			0
' convinced : @entity9 and @entity10 said police ignored their insistence that @entity11 is not the man who attacked them speaking out : the women have waived their right to anonymity to speak out as they believe the real rapist is still at large dark side of paradise : mrs @entity10 was dragged from a path near this beach in exclusive @entity22 , @entity5			1

@entity11 was accused of raping the two women two years *ago*
the *october* 2010 attacks were identical and carried out two days apart
both alleged victims said @entity11 was *n't* the man who attacked them
they claim *authorities* on the island were more *concerned* with *protecting* its reputation as a *tourist* 's paradise than investigating the *sex* attacks
