by @entity0 published : 05:10 est , 18 may 2012 updated : 07:39 est , 18 may 2012 revelations : details of an affair between @entity4 , @entity5 , pictured , and a @entity6 peer were covered in the press any claims charges against @entity9 over the phone hacking scandal may have been motivated by a tabloid expose of a key prosecuting lawyer ’s affair with a peer have been rubbished as ‘ preposterous ’			1
director of prosecutions @entity16 , @entity5 , mounted a fierce defence of his principal advisor @entity4 , @entity5 , amid suggestion she is not impartial because of her experiences at the hands of the press			1
in 2007 , married ms @entity4 - now in charge of overseeing @entity26 decision making and all potential prosecutions - embarked on a five - month affair with the then @entity30 ’s anti-terror adviser @entity29 of @entity31			1
the barrister ’s relationship with the peer 15 years her senior made national headlines after it was revealed by the @entity37			1
according to the @entity39 it is understood lawyers for the former @entity41 and @entity43 editor are weighing up whether to use the revelations to seek a judicial review , claiming ms @entity4 has a ‘ jaundiced view of the tabloid press ’			1
but the @entity48 , @entity49 , slammed any suggestions of a conflict of interest over the decision to bring charges of perverting justice			2
he said : ‘ it is preposterous to question the judgement of my principal legal advisor , @entity58 , on the basis that five years ago the @entity41 wrote three sentences about her private life , repeating what had been reported elsewhere and which had been , in any event , common knowledge for a year			1
headlines : @entity6 @entity68 , right , had a five - month affair with married @entity4 before confessing his adultery to loyal wife @entity71 , left ‘ @entity58 was not even aware that the @entity41 had written anything about her until it was drawn to her attention yesterday			1
she is a distinguished and highly respected @entity5			2
’ her legal team is said to be looking into whether ms @entity4 alone took the decision to bring charges – in which case a challenge may be more likely – or sought external legal advice			2
mrs @entity9 reacted with fury to the announcement , on tuesday , she - along with five others including her husband @entity83 - would be charged with perverting justice , branding it a ‘ witch - hunt ’			0
in an extraordinary outburst , former news international chief executive , said it was an ‘ expensive sideshow and a waste of public money ’			0
standing by her side , mr @entity83 – an @entity92 friend of @entity93 – said that he and four other suspects also charged with attempting to hide evidence from police had been made ‘ scapegoats ’			2
fury : @entity9 , right , reacted with anger to prosecutors ' decision to charge her and husband @entity83 , left , with perverting justice , branding it a ' witch - hunt ' earlier in the day the @entity26 had taken the unusual step of summoning the cameras to announce the charges live on television			0
miss @entity4 , who became a barrister at the age of 23 , told assembled journalists : ‘ this statement is made in the interests of transparency and accountability to explain the decisions reached in respect of allegations that @entity9 conspired with her husband , @entity83 , and others to pervert the course of justice			1
‘ @entity125 received a file of evidence from the @entity128 on 27th march 2012 in relation to seven suspects : ‘ all the evidence has now carefully been considered			0
‘ applying the two - stage test in the @entity133 i have concluded that in relation to all suspects except the seventh , there is sufficient evidence for there to be a realistic prospect of conviction			0
‘ i then considered the second stage of the test , and i have concluded that a prosecution is required in the public interest in relation to each of the other six			0
she added : ‘ all these matters relate to the ongoing police investigation into allegations of phone hacking and corruption of public officials in relation to the @entity41 and @entity43 newspapers			0
but the @entity5 also stressed : ‘ may i remind all concerned that these six individuals now will be charged with criminal offences and that each has a right to a fair trial			2
it is very important that nothing is said , or reported , which could prejudice that trial			0
for these reasons it would be inappropriate for me to comment further			0

affair between @entity4 , @entity5 , and a @entity6 peer made national headlines in 2007
but director of pubic prosecutions says ' preposterous ' to question her judgement because of publicity
