@entity1 paella , pulled pork burger , red velvet cupcakes - these all sound like delicacies from an upscale restaurant not meals for our pooches			1
but @entity10 wanted to be quirky and combine her love for food photography with her love for her dogs , and thus the book ' @entity15 ' was born			1
she told @entity16 that she wanted to raise the stakes and come up with something quirky that would humour people and was n't the everyday image			2
so she substituted humans for dogs			0
@entity32 has tested out most of her recipes on her 10 - year - old @entity35 cross cattle dog , @entity36 ' i am based in @entity38 and what i have noticed is that there is always a new trend , like the pulled - pork fad , ' she said			1

' i thought to myself , would n't it be great to do this for my dog - so i did and then started brainstorming more and more ideas for dog recipes			0
' recipes that you will come across in the book range from icy pole bones to winter warming vegetable soup and her personal favourite - red velvet pupcakes			1
the healthiness of the meal for the dog is paramount to @entity32 , so with the cupcakes , she uses beetroot to get the deep red colour and sugar - free yogurt for the icing			1
so as delicious as these meals appear in the images to anyone 's eye , they are aimed purely at dogs			2
' i actually ate the pulled - pork burger once , ' @entity32 said			2
' there is obviously no seasoning in any of the meals , its really simple plain food , so i had to add some relish			0
' recipes in the book range from icy pole bones to winter warming vegetable soup and red velvet pupcakes			1
@entity32 used @entity90 to source the dogs as she was new to @entity38 and did not know many dog owners her inspiration for the book has stemmed from her deep , childhood love for dogs @entity32 tested out most of the recipes on her 10 - year - old half ridgeback and half cattle dog , @entity36			1
her mum rescued @entity36 from the blue mountains when he was 4 - weeks - old			0
he was the runt of a litter of puppies whose mother could not adequately care for them so he has been with @entity32 ever since			2
her inspiration for the book has stemmed from her deep , childhood love for dogs			2
' i found a picture of myself when i was three - years - old at my parents house absolutely surrounded by dogs , ' she said			0
' i did n't have many kids to play with , so i had pets my entire life instead			0
' further motivation came when the @entity38 - based photographer was travelling in @entity119 and experienced the strewn mange , disease and dejection of the street dogs			1

she is planning another trip over there on the 20th of september to help @entity175 campaign and advertise their strong message			0
on being asked how she sourced the pooches for the shoot , @entity32 admitted it was not the most orthodox method			1
' believe it or not , i used @entity90 , ' she laughed			0
' i was new to @entity38 and did n't know any dog owners so i put an ad up on @entity186 and was taken aback by how many people responded			1
