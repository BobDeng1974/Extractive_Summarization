by @entity0 published : 07:15 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 10:47 est , 13 june 2013 festival goers need never run out of phone battery again thanks to a new range of denim shorts and sleeping bags that use body heat and movement to generate electricity			2
the @entity10 and @entity11 can charge a phone 's battery by harvesting energy from the human body using kinetic and thermoelectric technology			1
the wearable phone chargers have been designed by mobile phone company @entity18 with help from the @entity21			1
@entity18 has teamed up with the @entity21 to create wearable phone chargers for festival goers			1
the @entity10 , pictured , capture kinect energy from the wearer 's body movements			1
this energy can then be used to charge mobile handsets this image explains how the @entity10 work			1
they are fitted with foam - like ferroelectret smart materials which contain voids			2
the surfaces of these voids are permanently charged and as the size and shape of the voids in the shorts changes , when they 're squashed or deformed , a charge is produced the shorts are fitted with a phone connector and ferroelectret materials			2
as the wearer moves , the shorts gather kinetic energy when these ferroelectret materials are squashed or deformed			1
the surfaces of these voids are permanently charged			0
as the size and shape of the voids in the shorts changes , a charge is produced on the surface of the material			0
the @entity11 harvests thermal energy using the ' @entity54 '			1
this effect is a process that produces an electrical charge causes by the changes in temperature of a thermoelectric module			0
these modules are printed on the fabric of the sleeping bag			0
the power shorts are fitted with foam - like ferroelectret materials			1
as the wearer moves , the shorts gather kinetic energy when these ferroelectret materials are squashed or deformed			1
these foam - like materials contain voids			0
the surfaces of these voids are permanently charged and exhibit piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties			0
the word piezoelectricity means electricity resulting from pressure			0
when pressure is applied to the materials in the shorts they generate an electric charge			1
as the size and shape of the voids in the shorts changes this creates the electricity needed to charge the phone attached to the shorts by a connector inside the @entity89			2
the @entity11 harvests thermal energy using the ' @entity54 '			1
this effect creates pyroelectricity , which is the ability of certain materials to generate a temporary charge when they are heated up or cooled down			0
in the case of the sleeping bag , this process monitors the change of temperature through a thermoelectric module fitted to the fabric of the bag			0
heat from the sleeper 's body flows through this module contained within a multi-layered ' power felt '			1
this felt contains polymer films and two semi conductors that generate an electric charge as they heat up			2
the @entity11 works by harvesting thermal energy from the sleeper 's body heat			1
as the wearer sleeps , thermoelectric modules capture thermal energy			1
these modules contain insulating polymer films and two semi conductors that create an electric voltage to charge the phone in the @entity89 @entity18 's @entity10 and sleeping bag are not the first wearable phone chargers			1
in june 2010 , phone operator @entity126 announced its power wellies that have a power - generating sole which converts heat from the wearer 's feet into electrical current			1
this ' welectricity ' , as the makers call it , can then be used to charge a mobile phone			0
twelve hours of stomping through the muddy fields of festival sites will give you one hour of phone use			0
bouncing up and down in the dance tent gives you even more call time - because the hotter your feet get , the more energy is produced			0
the @entity127 were created with renewable energy experts @entity144			0
trials conducted by @entity18 found that a full day ’s walking and dancing while wearing the shorts can provide enough energy to charge a phone for four hours			1
while heat from a night in the sleeping bag is said to create 11 hours of charge			0
prof @entity154 from the university said : ' we ’re exploring two specific technologies to charge the power pocket - thermoelectrics and kinetic energy harvesting			1
' both represent cutting - edge research around smart fabrics and , in this case , we ’re looking to integrate these into a sleeping bag and a pair of denim shorts			0
' @entity18 's @entity167 added : ' our ambition was to create a practical but exciting solution to the charging - related issues experienced by many at outdoor events			2
' we hope people harness the power in their pocket to keep them chatting , texting , browsing and photographing throughout the entire festival season			0
' the ‘ smart fabric ’ technology will be unveiled ahead of this weekend ’s @entity179 and will continue to be developed throughout the summer			2
trials found @entity18 's @entity10 can provide enough energy to charge a phone for four hours			1
while heat harvested from the bodies of people using the sleeping bag , pictured , is said to create 11 hours of charge @entity18 's @entity10 and sleeping bag are not the first wearable phone chargers			1

this image shows how the ' power felt ' in the @entity11 works			2
it contains two semi conductors that can turn thermal body heat into an electrical charge			2

smart materials in the power shorts use kinetic energy created by the wearer 's movements to charge mobile phones
modules attached to the fabric of the @entity11 capture thermal energy from a sleeper 's body to create an electric charge
products have been developed by @entity18 and @entity21
