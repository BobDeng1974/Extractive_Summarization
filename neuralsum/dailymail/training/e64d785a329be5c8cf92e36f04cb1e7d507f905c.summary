by @entity0 a @entity2 retailer believes it may have cracked the recipe to the croissant - doughnut hybrid delicacy that took @entity5 by storm			1
greggs say its take on the cronut - dubbed the @entity10 - is the most exciting launch at the store since the birth of the sausage roll			1
the @entity15 has been two months in development and goes on sale tomorrow at £ 1 for a limited time			2
@entity19 , more famous for its sausage rolls , pasties and iced buns , is certainly taking on the bakery big guns by throwing its hat in the hybrid ring			2
taste sensation ? greggs say the @entity15 - their version of the cronut - is the most exciting innovation since the advent of the sausage roll the bona fide cronut , conceived by and sold exclusively at @entity36 in @entity5 , managed to do what no other baked good has done before			1
not even the @entity39 in its heyday could command the sort of hysteria and headlines that the cronut has garnered			0
customers slept outside the small bakery to be first in line outside the shop			0
tussles broke out when customers who had been queuing since as early as 4am vyed to get their hands on the dwindling supplies			0
supermodel @entity52 gave a box its own seat on a private jet so that her family could try them			1
the bakery was forced to limit purchases to one box per customer to meet demand , but scalpers capitalised by selling them on for $ 100 each cronut - or $ 3,000 for ten			1
perfect pastry ? the $ 5 ( £ 3.20 ) cronut was unveiled by @entity5 's @entity36 on may 10 - and almost immediately gained almost mythical status as pastry - lovers fought to get their hands on one the original cronut is said to be made lovingly using featherlight layers of pastry that are deep - fried , rolled in rose sugar and filled with @entity73 cream			1
the @entity15 , which comes in two flavours , berry or caramel - pecan , is made using a similar method - layers of pastry formed into a doughnut shape , fried , iced , and filled with either berry cream or caramel			2
it took @entity19 ' bakers two months to perfect the recipe - which they say ( of course they do ) is a ' taste sensation '			0
' we saw how successful the @entity90 was in @entity5 and challenged ourselves to make a @entity2 version , ' a spokesman said			0
' we believe the @entity15 could be the most exciting product launch at @entity19 since the birth of the sausage roll and are hoping the combination of a @entity19 own layered pastry shaped into a doughnut captures the taste buds of @entity100			1
' ' hopefully @entity52 will order some to be flown over to her from one of our shops ! ' the @entity104 to @entity36 the cronut , which has already received interest from curious pastry chefs in @entity108 , @entity109 , and @entity110 , is made from thin layers of flaky croissant dough that are deep fried , rolled in rose sugar , and then filled with light tahitian vanilla cream			1
rose - flavored glaze thinly coats the top layer , which peels apart like those in a mille crepe cake ; finally , crystallized rose petals add a garnish flourish			0
' a cronut is not as simple as frying up some croissant dough , ' said the chef			0
' we actually make a special laminated dough that is sheeted and folded different than a croissant '			0
@entity36 has expressed concern that scalpers are said that his cronuts man behind the invention : ' i 'm a big fan of quality over quantity ... it takes a lot to ensure all our other pastries are up to par with standards as well , ' said mr @entity36 and according to @entity19 : ' it took master bakers at the @entity2 ’s leading bakery retailer two months to perfect the recipe which @entity146 , @entity147 , says is a taste sensation			2
the @entity15 , which will be available for £ 1 in selected shops in @entity100 from tomorrow ( 6 september ) until 1 october , is a combination of @entity19 ' own layered pastry formed into the shape of a doughnut and is available in two flavours , summer berry & crème and caramel and pecan			2
' we saw how successful the @entity90 was in @entity5 and challenged ourselves to make a @entity2 version , ' they said .			0
