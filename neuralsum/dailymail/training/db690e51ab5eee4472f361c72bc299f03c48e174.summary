how many sexual partners have you had ? if the answer is five then the search for ' the one ' could be over			2
@entity4 have developed a love formula that can work out the key ingredients for a successful long lasting relationship , and it has revealed that the number of sexual partners someone has can affect their relationship success			1
the formula has been devised for those looking to give their love life a bit of a spring clean - be that by taking their relationship to the next level or by completely re-evaluating it			1
a new study reveals that we tend to settle down with our fifth sexual partner as that is when we are most sure of what we want from a relationship according to the 2,000 men and women surveyed to create the formula , we are most likely to settle with lover number five			1
exactly a quarter ( 25 per cent ) of both men and women believe their partner should have had a fair amount of experience with four sexual partners before them - though one in five men ( 21 per cent ) are holding onto tradition believing they should be their ideal woman ’s first partner			2
being funny is a big turn on apparently as when it comes to personality , the number one character trait both men and women search for in a partner is wit			0
how you act between the sheets also matters			0
some 26 per cent of men believe that a successful relationship needs to involve good sex in order to succeed where as only 13 per cent of women believe this to be true			1
the @entity61 is a slightly complicated mathematical puzzle , but psychologist @entity62 believes it 's not to be sniffed at and really could help us work out if we 're with ' the one ' 1 ) firstly , multiply the amount of years you knew each other before you became an item by .5 then add the number 8 to this number			1
let 's call this total number the ' special number ' 2 ) separately , add together the number of previous partners for both people and multiply by .2			0
minus this total from the special number total 3 ) multiply 9 by the importance the male attaches to honesty ( importance is ranked at 1 to 5 where 1 is least and 5 is most important )			0
add this to the special number total 4 ) then add the value the woman places on money ( scale of 1 to 5 again ) multiplied by 3 to the special number 5 ) add together the importance both place on humour ( using the scale of 1 to 5 again ) and add this to the special number 6 ) multiply the value both place on good looks ( added together ) by .3			0
minus this number from the running special number 7 ) @entity95 , minus the importance the female places on sex from the amount the male places on sex			0
multiple this result by .5 then square the result ( @entity105 multiply it by itself )			0
minus this result from the special number 8 ) add the importance the couple attached to inlaws ( added together ) to the special number 9 ) multiply the importance the couple places on children ( added together ) by 1.5 , then add this number to the special number 9 ) the final ' special number ' is the amount of years you 'll be together @entity4 ’s relationship expert and psychologist @entity117 says that the reason we wait till partner number five to settle is because we are most sure of ourselves then			1
' most people enter a serious relationship , hoping it will last forever			1
few know that it ’s only by the time they get to sexual partner number five that they really know what they want , and are confident to voice it			2
when it comes to personal traits both men and women search for good wit in a long term partner ' good looks might help sexual attraction , but they do n’t last forever , so it ’s important to look at your partner ’s personality , wants and desires as well			2
' she goes on to say that the @entity4 love formula is not something to be sniffed at and can really help us work out what we want from a relationship			1
' the msn spring love formula can help determine the traits we should be looking for			0
it can even indicate how long a relationship might last based on compatibility and mutual goals			1
forewarned is forearmed , even in love			0
' @entity160 from @entity161 , @entity162 , has been with his girlfriend for two years and spent ten minutes working out the equation of the @entity4 love formula			1
the 30 - year - old said : ' i spent a few minutes working out the formula and it revealed i will stay with my girlfriend for 33 years and 3 @entity170 'm delighted with the results , we 've only been together for a year and a half and these results are promising			0
' although @entity160 was pleased with his long lasting result he was a little concerned as to what might happen once the 33 years are up			2
although we do not have plans to get married , 33 years is incredibly encouraging , though i do wonder what is going to happen at that point ! ' for more on the spring love formula , visit @entity183 /			0

@entity4 developed @entity61 to work out how long relationships will last
shows that longest relationships tend to stem from fifth lover
by this time we know what we want from a relationship
