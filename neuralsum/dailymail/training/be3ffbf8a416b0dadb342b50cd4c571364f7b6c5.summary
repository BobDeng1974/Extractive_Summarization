it may come as a surprise to the houseproud and ' clean freaks ' among us but the kitchen sponge is one of the dirtiest places in the home - 200,000 times dirtier than a toilet seat			1
and it is not just harmless bacteria lurking on your cleaning cloths and utensils			1
experts have linked germs found on sponges , cloths and chopping boards with a bacteria which can cause paralysis			1
friend or foe ? far from being a tool to clean your home , the sponge could be making it dirtier and more dangerous the @entity28 advises all cloths , sponges and towels should be washed above @entity32 to kill germs or they should be disinfected regularly			2

and you would be better off chopping your vegetables on a toilet seat than on a chopping board when it comes to germs , scientists have claimed			0
dr @entity81 , professor of microbiology at the @entity83 , leads studies on how diseases are transferred through the environment			0
his work involves swabbing household items and measuring the type and growth of bacteria			2
he told the @entity92 the toilet seat is one of the cleanest things you 'll run across in terms of micro-organisms			0
but he said we should be more worried about other household items , such as sponges , dish cloths , and reusable shopping bags			2
professor @entity103 , one of @entity105 ’s leading microbiologists , agreed the kitchen and in particular the sponge was among the dirtiest places in the home			1
he told @entity110 : ' it would be fine to use the sponge to wash up with , wiping food off the plates in hot water , but never , never use a sponge to wipe a plate clean			2
' there is a science to this sort of thing , and it 's not rocket science			0
there is a certain amount of common sense			0
' prof @entity103 said one of the biggest targets for the @entity128 was a bacteria called campylobacter - which can cause paralysis and is commonly found on kitchen sponges			1
he said : ' it is naturally occurring and comes from poultry			0
' it can cause something called @entity137			1
dirty truth : a new study has found there are around 10million bacteria per square inch of a kitchen sponge and a million per square inch on a dish cloth ' it does n't affect your thinking or feeling , but it can spread to the peripheral nerves around the brain and effect movement			1
a hygiene in the @entity153 tested 180 homes in @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity105 and @entity162 bathroom seals caused most concern , with 70per cent failing bacterial tests fridge interiors came second - more than 40per cent of homes failed tests on bacteria and mould build - up kitchen towels were found to be unsatisfactory or unacceptably dirty in 36per cent of homes cleanest surface tested was pushchair with only six per cent failing bacterial tests ' people can be effectively locked in			1
' in the majority of cases , people will get better , but recovery can take weeks , months or years			0
' always the dirtiest thing by far is the kitchen sponge , ' adds @entity183 , professor of virology at the @entity185 and chair of the @entity28 - the body that compares hygiene standards across the world			1
in its latest study the council examines samples from homes in nine different countries , and finds that 21per cent of ' clean ' kitchen cloths actually have high levels of contamination			2
the study identifies faecal bacteria in other places around the home , and this varies from one country to another			0
according to the study @entity160 has the dirtiest fridges , with 95 per cent of the fridges in the study failing the bacteriology test for @entity210			0
in @entity161 , the dirtiest item is the bath seal , with almost two - thirds with concerning levels of @entity210 and 40per cent for mould .			0

there are 10million bacteria per square inch of a kitchen sponge and *1m* per square inch on a dish cloth
bacteria found on them can cause @entity137 *syndrome* , which can lead to loss of movement
