there was not a hairdryer in sight but there was plenty of hair standing on the backs of necks			2
‘ i went into a sort of trance listening to him , ’ said @entity8 , perhaps explaining what happened to certain referees at @entity11 over the years			1
@entity8 was speaking on the morning after the highlight of his @entity16 week so far , the presence in the @entity19 team room at @entity20 of @entity22 ’s finest - ever football manager , sir @entity23			1
@entity8 has admitted he was ' in a trance ' during sir @entity23 's motivational speech @entity26 is preparing for the @entity16 at @entity20 with the @entity19 team sir @entity23 has been used to be giving motivational speeches during his time at @entity11 the great man went into fine detail about how to deal with the mantle of favouritism , and how he made @entity11 a fortress			1
‘ he talked about how when teams went there it was very hard for them to compete and how we ’re slight favourites for a reason and we should embrace it , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ i was looking up at him and i could n’t take my eyes off him			2
i ’m just listening and thinking this is all the stuff he ’s probably said to all the great @entity46 teams over the years			1
‘ he told us a couple of stories about his experience in big matches , and we got to ask him questions about what he thought was a key element to being successful as a team			2
‘ he ’s just a very inspirational man when he talks			1
he ’s got a lot of authority and the room just goes quiet and everyone listens			2
’ not everyone was quite as rapt as the big @entity46 fan , of course			1
not with fans of @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 represented among the other 11 team members			2
‘ believe me , they let it be known that not everyone in the room was a @entity46 fan , ’ said @entity8			1
@entity66 fan @entity73 probably spoke for the rest			1
‘ given who i support you ’ll appreciate i ’m probably not his biggest fan in the world , but i think when you have the chance to listen to somebody who has been up there in sports , it ’s always interesting to pick their brain , ’ he said			1
‘ he was fascinating and i think i speak for everyone when i say we ’re glad we got to know him a little better			2
’ it was n’t just the players @entity23 addressed			2
he had a little banter with the caddies as well			0
‘ as you can imagine , he enjoyed all that , ’ said @entity19 captain @entity93 , who hatched the idea some months ago			0
‘ i was upstairs at the time having a rules meeting and even though it was one floor down and five rooms across , i could hear the laughter coming up			0
’ @entity8 is a huge @entity46 fan and said the former manager 's speech was inspirational @entity8 takes part in a practice session at @entity106 on tuesday @entity23 's entrance at @entity20 was supposed to be a surprise , according to captain @entity93 day two of official practice and plenty of pairings that will see service during the @entity16 itself were in action on both sides			1
@entity117 and @entity118 were in tandem , as were @entity120 and @entity121			0
@entity122 and @entity123 got another trial runout together , while @entity125 played with @entity126			0
it is what will happen with the other four players that is particularly interesting — @entity8 , @entity73 , @entity131 and @entity132			1
all four will surely see action on the first morning but who will be paired with whom ? will @entity93 take the high - profile option and go for @entity8 and @entity131 , with the former playing with @entity132 in the foursomes after lunch ? just as he has all week , @entity8 had a new driver in the bag yesterday and was quick to allay any fears that it represented a gamble			1
‘ this is a driver that i have been actually using and practising with since june , and i would n’t be putting it in the bag if i did n’t feel it was better , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s the only driver i have been practising with , so i think that probably gives a clear idea of what is going to happen			2
’ as for the @entity155 , captain @entity154 ’s selections appear cast in stone			0
for the second day running he sent them out in the same order			0
you ’ve got the a team of @entity161 ( left ) and @entity162			0
masters champion @entity165 will partner @entity163 and @entity164 will team up with rookie @entity166			0
veteran @entity167 has been paired with another debutant , @entity168			0
@entity169 and @entity170 will see action together , as will @entity172 and @entity173			0
to be fair to @entity154 , all make perfect sense , but it does lead to the question of where ’s the @entity178 if things are not going to plan			0
the action unfolded on a sublime autumn day and was played out before a vast crowd			0
@entity183 ’s first minister @entity182 turned up , looking none too bruised from last week ’s experience			0
what @entity182 and the organisers would give for three days of such weather come tomorrow			0
this particular course at @entity20 might be far from a masterpiece but it is clear it is going to be a great @entity16 course , with fabulous viewing spots for spectators and sumptuous glimpses of the amazing scenery			0
only one day to go now , and @entity162 has raised the stakes deliciously with his tasty , barbed attack on @entity8 and @entity122 , while poking fun at @entity19 ’s supposedly superior team spirit			1
all we need now to complete the scene is for @entity8 and @entity162 to be drawn to play against one another tomorrow morning			1
would n’t that set the @entity16 alight ? @entity204 's @entity19			0

@entity208 is a huge @entity46 fan and admits he was in a trance
