by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor backing : @entity3 's private secretary used a memo to officials to raise the prospect of opening up state schools to foreign pupils foreign pupils would be charged thousands of pounds to attend @entity11 state schools under a controversial plan backed by @entity3			1
despite warnings of a growing shortage of school places , a leaked @entity14 memo reveals a plan is being hatched to open up the education system to more children from overseas			1
the letter orders universities minister @entity22 to work with the @entity23 on ways of ‘ allowing international students to access places at academies ’			1
however the plan is set to spark a furious government row , with the @entity29 vowing to block any attempt to part - privatise spaces in the classrooms of state schools			1
the four - page letter , marked restricted , was sent by mr @entity3 ’s private secretary to @entity36 , a senior adviser at the @entity37			1
it sets out ‘ suggestions for you to develop and agree ’ including allowing the parents of foreign pupils to buy their way into @entity11 state education system			1
it states : ‘ we have some of the most successful and innovative publicly - funded schools in the world and an internationally renowned independent sector			2
‘ we would ask you to work with the @entity23 on increasing the place of schools in the [ education exports industrial ] strategy			2
‘ this is meant to be a long - term strategy and while the @entity57 programme should focus on consolidating domestic progress over the next couple of year , we should look at export potential too			2
‘ this should include consideration of allowing international students to access places at academies			1
’ according to @entity68 , which obtained the letter , @entity67 insiders have made clear that the prime minister would not allow any plan to put further pressure on @entity11 taxpayers			1
a source told the newspaper : ‘ this week the government has launched a blitz to stop foreigners getting free access to the @entity80			2
‘ therefore the idea that international pupils would attend @entity11 state schools for free is a non starter			2

’ but mr @entity3 insisted that the government has promised additional money for 500,000 extra school places , ‘ so we should be able to provide those school places without seeing an increase in classes ’			0
‘ we have made education a priority			0
that is why the amount of money going into our schools is going up and not down			0
‘ that is why we are funding half a million extra school places			0
