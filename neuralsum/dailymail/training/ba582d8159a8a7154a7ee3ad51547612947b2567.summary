@entity11 , a professional ballerina and food blogger who lives in @entity14 , was left depressed for years suffering with chronic eczema until she learnt how to cure herself via diet			1
speaking about her ailment , the 17 - year - old said : ' i used to describe it as a snood of eczema , as it covered all around my neck and all over the rest of my body			1
i was never diagnosed with any allergies or given treatments that cured it , so i decided to take matters into my own hands			1
' i took the radical decision to completely cut dairy out of my diet , and within a month my eczema had disappeared - it was amazing , ' she said			1
' my eczema had been really mentally weighing me down , it was so sore and inflamed and made me very insecure			1
the difference in my confidence , energy levels and happiness when it disappeared were really noticeable			1
' that was the first of a long list of changes that @entity11 made to her diet and as a ballerina , who trains for eight hours a day , she realised she needed to start fuelling her body with the best possible nutrients			1

' the more i learnt , the more passionate i became , and that ’s when my culinary adventure really started , ' she said			1
she embraced a vegan , gluten - free , sugar - free and wheat - free diet and set up her blog , @entity97 , where she shares recipes and blogs her journey to a healthier lifestyle			1
' the @entity97 philosophy is all about embracing food the way nature made it - completely unrefined and unprocessed , ' she said			1
high on health : @entity11 believes that meat , dairy , sugar and gluten are acidic and inflammatory to the body but her new diet leaves her feeling energetic and full of life ' in a nutshell , it is about cooking meals that are packed with nutrients and completely delicious			1
it is a simple way of eating that creates the flavours you love , naturally			1
it is not about depriving yourself and allows you to cook indulgent , healthy meals that taste incredible and make you feel great in body and mind			1
' @entity11 believes that meat , dairy , sugar and gluten are acidic and inflammatory to the body and left her feeling lethargic and bloated			1
since cutting them out , she says her mood , energy levels , and wellbeing has sky - rocketed			1
' this way of life took me from being down and depressed to utterly high on health , ' she said			1
she starts the day with a smoothie bowl full of nuts and superfoods and has big batches of quinoa , lentils , roasted sweet potato wedges and hummus for lunch			2
for dinner she creates healthy versions of food so sweet potato and black bean burgers instead of beef burgers and vegetable risottos with a cashew - lemon cream rather than a dairy - based one			1
