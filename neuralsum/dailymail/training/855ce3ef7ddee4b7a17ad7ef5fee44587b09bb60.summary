by @entity0 published : 06:43 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 10:54 est , 18 january 2013 with her bold wardrobe choices , singer @entity1 is almost as famous for what she wears as for her music so nobody was surprised when she announced a collaboration with @entity7 back in july			2
but now the singer has gone one better and has revealed that not only did she design the 50 piece collection herself , she also intends to present it to the world on the @entity13 catwalk			2
the invitation - only show will take place on the 16th february and will be styled by the pop princess in person and followed by a huge after show party in the capital			2
behind the scenes : @entity1 has dropped a few hints about the contents of the collection via @entity24 ' launching at @entity13 is a dream come true for me , ' the @entity26 singer revealed			1
' i have wanted to design my own collection for a long time and to present my collection for @entity7 alongside all of the other great design talent at @entity13 is a real privilege			1
' i ca n't wait to see the reaction from my fans and the fashion press ! ' @entity1 's foray into the fashion world , if she pulls it off as planned , wo n't be the first time a singer has successfully made the leap from music to fashion design			1
@entity45 , @entity46 , has proved to be an enormously talented designer and has produced a string of critically acclaimed collections			0
@entity52 's @entity51 line has also confounded expectations and has achieved mainstream success , particularly in the @entity55			0
fashion challenge : @entity1 's collection will make its debut in front of the cream of the style world , including @entity55 @entity63 editor , @entity62 avant - garde : @entity1 is famed for her fierce sense of style and her own collection is expected to follow suit			1
her self - designed @entity7 jumpsuit ( right ) certainly fits the bill but not all have done so well			0
@entity73 's @entity72 was panned for being poorly designed and looking cheap , although husband , @entity76 's @entity75 line is believed to sell well			0
one collection unlikely to appeal to most @entity1 fans is the ' @entity81 ' clothing line , which was launched by the singer 's violent on / off boyfriend , @entity82 , last november			1
according to @entity82 , who designed the ' artwork ' splashed across the front of the t - shirts in the range , the line reflect an ' unknown ' part of him			0
' we really have nâ€™t mastered the art of making a pyramid ourselves , like the ancient ones , ' he waffled			0
' the black pyramid label is basically an unknown art. so i think my painting , my designs , whatever i do fashion wise is unknown to a lot of people			0
' although @entity1 's collection is likely to be considerably more stylish - and certainly less bizarrely described - fashion fans will have to wait until march to get their hands on the pieces			1
what form they will take is still shrouded in mystery although @entity1 has let slip the odd hint via @entity110 , and was pictured wearing a blue boilersuit from the collection in november			0
needless to say , if they 're anything like the singer 's own colourful style , summer on the streets of the @entity119 looks set to be very bright indeed - whatever the weather does ! bright spark : @entity1 's colourful style has met with approval from the fashion world the good , the bad and the dreadful : although the work of @entity46 ( right ) has met with widespread acclaim , the dreadful @entity82 ( left ) has created a line that can be described in a single word : bad			1

@entity131 's debut fashion collection will be presented on february 16th
the invite only show is expected to attract an *a-list* packed front *row*
@entity1 describes taking part in @entity13 as ' a real privilege '
