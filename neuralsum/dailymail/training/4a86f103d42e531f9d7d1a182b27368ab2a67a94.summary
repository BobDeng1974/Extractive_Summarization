by @entity0 last updated at 11:50 pm on 26th february 2012 thousands more pensioners may have to sell their family homes to afford inflation - busting increases in residential care fees			1
research has found average care home fees have soared by as much as 14 per cent over the past year , forcing families to find hundreds of pounds more every month			1
fees are rising because councils , which fund poorer residents , are slashing back the amount they are prepared to pay for them			1
painful reading : this table shows the regional variations in the costs of nursing and residential care , and the increases over the last two years this means private care home operators are making up the difference by increasing prices for everyone else			1
in @entity26 , where the rises have been highest , annual average charges are now £ 35,300 , up £ 4,400 from a year ago			1
for those who have to go into a nursing home offering more care and attention , costs are even greater			2
in counties to the north of @entity26 , average charges are £ 45,100 a year			2
across the @entity37 the average residential care home fee is £ 27,300 – up 5 per cent on a year ago – while nursing home charges have risen 4 per cent to £ 37,500			1
the research , by @entity37 , revealed a postcode lottery , with pensioners paying far more for residential care in some areas than others			1
while average fees were highest in the capital at £ 679 a week , in @entity48 they have soared by 12 per cent to £ 554 a week ( £ 28,800 a year ) and in the @entity49 and @entity50 by 11 per cent to £ 487 a week ( £ 25,300 a year )			2
sad state of affairs : more than 20,000 pensioners have to sell their homes every year to pay for the massive costs of residential care , often denying their children inheritance in the process ( picture posed by model ) the increases are being fuelled by town hall cuts that see extra costs piled on those who pay for their care because they have savings of more than £ 23,500 , while those who have not been thrifty get it free			1
at least 20,000 pensioners are forced to sell their homes every year to pay the huge costs of residential care , denying their children an inheritance			2
the increased charges will mean many more will have to sell up			0
age @entity37 ’s figures , compiled using data from healthcare analysts @entity73 & @entity74 , represent average increases including both the fees paid by councils for state - funded residents as well as those paid by private payers			1
self - funders pay around £ 100 more for their places than councils , meaning the fee increases hide the reality that costs for private residents are rising even more steeply			2
the figures come just months before ministers set out a long - awaited white paper on reform of social care			0
economist @entity92 suggested in an independent report last summer that there should be a cap of around £ 35,000 to prevent unlimited charges			0
but there are indications that insurance schemes to enable this would not be in place for another 15 years			0
last night @entity102 of @entity37 said : ‘ the under - funding crisis in care is hitting older people hard and self - funding care home residents are unjustly having to foot the bill for cuts to social care			1
‘ care home residents are n’t in a position to move and shop around for more affordable deals			1
and for those who self - fund , the low interest earned from savings accounts wo n’t cover these price increases			0
‘ older people in residential care need a fair deal when they are paying for their care			0
‘ to tackle the immediate crisis , the government has to recognise and close the gap in social care spending			0
’ @entity125 , @entity126 ’s spokesman for care and older people , said : ‘ thousands of self - funders are ordinary people on middle incomes			0
‘ they have worked hard and saved all their lives and are now being forced to sell their homes to pay for their care , through no fault of their own			0
‘ the government is out of touch on this issue , and in denial about the real impact their cuts are having			0
‘ we urgently need a better , fairer way to fund care for older people			0
cross-party talks on this issue , which @entity126 called for , are now under way			0
’ last night @entity151 of the @entity152 said : ‘ there is no evidence that care providers , forced to make penny - pinching savings on their local authority contracts , are compensating for the losses by over-charging individual self - funding residents and their families			2

councils are cutting back on funding for poorer residents
care home charges up as much as £ 4,400 on a year ago
pensioners face post code lottery , research by @entity37 shows
