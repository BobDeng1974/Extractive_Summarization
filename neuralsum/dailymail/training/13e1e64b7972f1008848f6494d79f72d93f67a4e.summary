by @entity0 a gel that was found to reduce the rate of hiv infection among monkeys when administered after sex could possibly work on humans too , researchers have found			1
scientists have found that monkeys can be protected against @entity4 infection with a vaginal gel , even when it is administered three hours after sex			1
the research , which was published in @entity15 on wednesday , tested a new microbicidal vaginal gel on macaque monkeys			0
macaque monkeys were treated with the new gel and five out of the six monkeys were protected from infection 12 monkeys were given vaginal washes of simian @entity4 to mimic sex with an infected monkey			1
three hours later , six of these monkeys were treated with the newly - developed gel and the other six were given a placebo gel			0
of the six macaques given the new gel , only one was infected with @entity4 , compared to all six of the monkeys who were treated with the placebo			2
if the gel works in humans , it could represent a breakthrough for preventing @entity4 infection , particularly for women who have been raped			0
@entity41 , a professor of obstetrics at the @entity43 , told the @entity44 that if the gel worked in humans , ‘ it could be used for @entity4 prevention like @entity46 or the morning - after pill for contraception ’			0
the gel contains raltegravri , antiretroviral drug already in use for @entity4 treatment , and some hiv - prevention gels do exist , but they usually require a pre-exposure dose			1
success in monkeys does not always predict success among humans , and testing such drugs on humans is complicated and raises serious ethical considerations			0
however , the results are encouraging and add to a sense of optimism in the field of hiv research			2
two separate trials last week showed that monkeys who received injections of slow - release @entity4 drugs were protected from infection for weeks			1
in other research , two babies in the @entity78 who were born infected with @entity4 appear to have been cured by large doses of drugs administered soon after birth			0
the study adds to other encouraging findings in the field of @entity79 in the last few weeks			2

@entity87 published this week found that a gel reduced rate of hiv - infection
five out of six monkeys treated with the gel were protected against infection
study adds to other encouraging results in the field of @entity4 research
