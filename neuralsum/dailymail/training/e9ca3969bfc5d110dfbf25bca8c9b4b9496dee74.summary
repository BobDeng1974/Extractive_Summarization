the poll put the conservatives on 31 per cent while @entity41 were at 13 per cent – ahead of the @entity42 , who remained unchanged on ten per cent			1
however the survey is of those who say they are certain to vote – and @entity10 supporters are less likely to say they will definitely turn up at the ballot box			2
but it does underscore how soft @entity10 ’s lead is			2
privately , @entity10 insiders are warning of a ‘ crisis of legitimacy ’ if the party only secures a 34 per cent share of the vote at the next general election			1

@entity80 has also taken a swipe at mr @entity2 ’s leadership , warning last month @entity10 was in danger of becoming party of protest			1
