her home is a tent , her parents missing and her younger brothers going hungry but there 's nothing that @entity7 , 17 , can do about it			1
she is just one of a growing number of southern @entity10 children forced to become both mother and father to her younger siblings after the latest round of fighting in @entity17 's newest country left them penniless refugees in a camp in northern @entity21			1
' we started hearing the gun shots while our parents were out , and we tried to stay at home , but we heard people screaming			1
so we packed our things and left , ' says @entity7			1
difficult : @entity7 , 17 , was forced to flee from the fighting in @entity10 with her three younger brothers in tow ' there ’s no education and i ca n’t achieve my dream of being an accountant			1
i wanted to help my mother and my people			0
i wanted everyone to be educated			0
she adds : ' i do n’t know where my mother is			0
' like @entity7 and her brothers , @entity42 , also 17 , calls the @entity44 refugee camp in @entity21 's @entity45 home			1
' i ran with my brothers , without my friends , ' she explains			2
' my mother was not around , so we came here			0
' getting water is difficult , so is getting food , we ’re just children without a mother			0
i want to study but i have to be their mother now , i have to stay with my siblings and be their mother until i find her			2
' according to the latest @entity60 figures , there are now 46,874 refugees from @entity10 in @entity21 ’s @entity45 region , all of whom fled the fighting which broke out there last december between government forces and troops loyal to opposition leader @entity68			1
escape : many of the refugees currently living in northern @entity21 camps are children a machete - wielding man chases passers - by in @entity75 , @entity10			1
fighting has raged since december currently orchestrating the opposition to the @entity79 troops commanded by president @entity80 , @entity68 is no stranger to fighting			2
he is also no stranger to the @entity82 and along with completing a degree during a stay in the country , married @entity82 aid worker @entity86 in the early 1990s - much to the horror of other aid workers			0
despite the outrage , @entity86 went to live in @entity10 with @entity68 , then engaged in a long - running conflict with the @entity10 government			1
although @entity68 was rumoured to be using child soldiers , @entity86 was responsible for getting 160 children to safety in the face of intense fighting			1
sadly , their love was not to last			0
in 1993 , @entity7 became pregnant and moved to @entity99 in @entity100 with the intention of staying until the baby was born			1
but on 24th november 1993 , she was hit by an out - of - control taxi and she and her unborn child were killed			0
she was just 29 years old			0
many are children , and some , like @entity42 and @entity7 , are completely alone and at risk of everything from sexual abuse to human trafficking			1
according to @entity115 , @entity114 ’s water , sanitation and hygiene coordinator in @entity21 , girls like @entity42 and @entity7 also face having their education curtailed and take on the lion 's share of caring for their younger siblings			1
' girls have escaped the war and come here without parents , with their brothers and sisters , ' she explains			1
' they have nothing and they do n’t know where to start from			0
little girls of 16 and 17 are taking care of their siblings			1
' it ’s the girls who are overloaded with household chores – they do the cooking , they look for firewood and fetch the water at five o’clock in the morning			0
' we are also finding many challenges in terms of accessing water – girls in such a situation find it very hard to cope because they do n’t have changing rooms and they share toilets , there ’s no privacy			0
' ' it ’s devastating to see the dire consequences for adolescent girls in these camps , both inside and outside @entity10 , ' adds @entity152 , ceo of @entity114			2
' having fled fighting and separated from their parents , they face a daily struggle to find food , water and shelter for themselves and their younger siblings			1
frightening : one of the girls forced into northern @entity21 's refugee camps following fighting in @entity10 thirsty work : @entity42 fetches water for her younger brothers from a spot close to the refugee camp all smiles : @entity42 's trio of younger brothers appear to be having fun as they pose for a photograph ' without support and a proper education , these girls could become a lost generation , facing an uncertain future and few prospects			1
' they face threats including violence and early marriage which prevent them from improving their own lives and those of their future children			2
' for now , the fighting rages on across the border , with experts predicting that refugees could face a wait of up to two years before being allowed to return home			2
while they wait , @entity42 continues to look after her brothers and sisters , and dreams that one day she will find her mother			2
' i dreamt that i found her , ' she says			0
' i was very happy			0
staying without your mum is not good			0
i want to be in a good place , and here is not a good place			0
' @entity10 has long been a tinderbox with conflicting tribal loyalties and warring leaders the driving force behind the latest outbreak of hostilities			2
the conflict , which broke out in december 2013 , pits opposition leader @entity68 and his largely @entity216 followers , against president @entity80 and his supporters , most of whom are part of @entity10 's largest tribe , the @entity221			2
this is not the first time the two tribes have gone to war			0
during the liberation war against northern @entity10 , @entity68 turned on his @entity221 colleagues before being welcomed back into the fold ahead of independence			1
the most recent round of fighting began on 15th december 2013 when @entity68 decided to boycott a meeting and @entity80 responded by having the presidential guard disarmed , with the exception of the @entity221 troops			2
their @entity216 colleagues objected and fighting broke out , swiftly intensifying when @entity221 militias in @entity10 's capital @entity75 began attacking @entity216 civilians			1
according to reports , @entity221 soldiers also conducted house - to - house searches in a bid to flush out civilians and were responsible for an attack on a @entity60 compound that left two @entity249 peacekeepers dead			0
@entity80 blamed the deaths on @entity68 and accusing him of attempting a coup			0
@entity68 retaliated by claiming @entity80 was playing politics and denied planning to take power			0
