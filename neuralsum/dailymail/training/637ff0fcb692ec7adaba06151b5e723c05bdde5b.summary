by @entity0 he is unflinching in describing autopsies in his bestselling crime novels			2
so it ’s a surprise that @entity5 is squeamish			1
but the creator of the detective superintendent @entity8 series – who has attended real - life dissections for research – says his own operation for carpal tunnel syndrome was ‘ stomach - churning ’			1
the ten - minute surgery , carried out under local anaesthetic , was , however , life - changing for the 65 - year - old , who had struggled in agony through book signings on international publicity tours			1
hand horror : author @entity5 could n't bear to watch his carpal tunnel operation - but is typing at full speed again when diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a few years ago , @entity5 had upped his fitness regime , running two to five miles every day			1
but that stopped last may when his other passion , racing cars , resulted in a nasty accident which doctors believe may have triggered carpal tunnel syndrome ( @entity31 ) , a common condition that causes pain , numbness , tingling and a dull ache in the hand , fingers and arm			1
‘ i rolled my race car at @entity40 and bust three ribs , ’ he says			2
‘ initially my left leg was in pain and then my right leg , with pain running down my fingertips into the right hand where i ’d wrenched at the steering wheel			2
i did n’t know then but i had popped some discs in my back too			2
‘ it was only two days later when friends began to say “ we ’re glad we ’re not reading your obituary ” that i realised how serious it had been			2
i felt a wreck and very strange for two weeks afterwards			0
’ with 14 million books sold worldwide in 36 languages , it was little wonder that @entity5 decided to press on with his tours			1
‘ i was in agony in @entity64 and painkillers were n’t doing anything for the pain in my legs and arm , so i could n’t sleep			0
when i got home , i visited acupuncturist @entity71 in @entity72 and within an hour of leaving his clinic , 90 per cent of the pain had gone			0
’ but the relief was short - lived and a book tour of @entity77 saw @entity5 with a ‘ constant burning agony in both legs ’ which left him ‘ hobbling round like an old git ’			1
he adds : ‘ then i had to go on tour in @entity83 and i was in such pain after the flight that i was wheeled through immigration			0
the hotel concierge recommended an osteopath , who was brilliant and again got rid of most of my pain			0
’ back home in @entity91 , @entity5 persevered with his fitness regime – swimming , biking and running			1
the author of 25 novels also continued with his strict daily writing , working on @entity97 , his tenth @entity8 novel			1
but typing was increasingly tricky as numbness crept into his right hand			0
now the medical profession did some detective work			0
he saw neurosurgeon @entity103 at @entity104 , who referred @entity5 for a nerve conductivity test			1
it sent electric shocks from the shoulder to both right and left hand			0
if the nerves conducted equally in both hands , the pain was not due to the slipped discs but to the median nerve travelling through the carpal tunnel			1
‘ the neurologist said i had carpal tunnel syndrome as badly as he had ever seen it			1
left as it was , i would experience numb fingertips which would increasingly impact on my writing			2
i already could n’t feel the space bar on the keyboard and had no feeling in my thumb			0
’ carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression of the nerve that controls feeling and movement in the hands			1
the carpal tunnel is a narrow passage in the wrist comprising a band of tissue and small bones which act as a pulley system for tendons , enabling the fingers to bend			1
@entity31 occurs in about 50 per cent of pregnant women and is more prevalent in those who use their hands repetitively such as musicians , hairdressers and typists			0
it can also be hereditary			0
surgery is recommended for severe cases if symptoms last more than six months or other treatments such as wearing a splint or taking anti-inflammatories are ineffective			0
the carpal ligament is cut to ease pressure on the nerve			2
@entity5 was treated by consultant orthopaedic , hand and upper limb surgeon @entity157 of @entity158 and @entity159 , @entity160			1
but as he began to cut , @entity5 became visibly unwell			1
‘ mr @entity157 asked me , “ do n’t you go to lots of autopsies ? ” i replied yes , but not my own			0
a screen was put up so i could n’t see , but i could feel tiny electric currents as he was moving the nerves around and i heard crunching			0
@entity169 told me she had the same procedure and watched it from a mirror above the bed			0
i could n’t have managed that			0
‘ it took ten minutes – i went in at 7am and by 8.45 i was being driven home , typing emails all the way			2
i was determined to not let it stop me writing			2
’ was n’t that ill - advised ? ‘ no – my surgeon said just do n’t do anything that hurts – and it did n’t			2
’ one month later , @entity5 is back to full speed on the writing front , although fastening shirt buttons and winding a watch are tricky			1
‘ i still have numbness in the thumb and forefinger but it is improving and it may take up to a year to return to normal , ’ he says			1
‘ @entity189 , i have no symptoms in my left hand			0
opening a bottle of wine is difficult as you need strength in both hands			0
but maybe the answer is champagne			0

the 65 - year - old was able to return to writing just a month later
