by @entity0 published : 05:23 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 05:56 est , 24 october 2013 an @entity3 biologist has spoken of his horror of finding a parasitic worm living in his mouth			1
dr @entity8 , 36 , played host to a @entity11 pulchruma parasite which spent three months moving around the fleshy part of his cheeks and lips			1
the parasite is usually only found in livestock and dr @entity8 ’s was just the 13th reported case in the @entity3 , and the 60th worldwide			1
dr @entity19 saw a surgeon about the lump in his bottom lip ( left ) but was told it was ' normal ' so he decided to take matters into his own hands and removed the parasite ( right ) himself using forceps dr @entity8 , an invertebrate specialist at the @entity29 , in @entity30 , was teaching a class when he first noticed a raised lump in his mouth , @entity27 reported			1
‘ it was in the mucosa [ the fleshy part of the cheek ]			2
the first three months , it was in the back of the throat in places i could touch with my tongue , ’ he told the website			2
‘ i could feel it with my tongue but not my finger			0
it was n't until it moved to my lip that i could see it and was willing to talk to someone other than my wife and confess this was in my body			0
’ when dr @entity8 noticed the parasite in his mouth he visited his dentist who referred him to a surgeon			1
however , when he saw the oral surgeon and explained that he had investigated his condition and believed himself to be the host of a parasite , the medic failed to believe him			1
dr @entity8 said : ‘ he said it was a normal discolouration in my mouth and he sees it all the time			1
’ after the encounter , dr @entity8 decided to deal with the problem himself			1
dr @entity8 , 36 , played host to a @entity11 pulchruma parasite which spent three months moving around the fleshy part of his cheeks and lips			1
he now keeps it in a jar he used forceps to remove the parasite from his cheek with the help of his wife			2
he then discovered that his neighbour is an expert on the @entity76 so the pair set about studying it			0
dr @entity8 now keeps the worm in a jar			1
he has written a paper in the @entity82 about his experience as a host for the parasite			2
it is a worm that has no circulatory or respiratory system			0
it is usually found in animals - especially cattle , dogs , cats and rabbits - but can be transmitted to humans through unsanitary conditions and the ingestion of infected insects			0
it can also be picked up from foods that are contaminated during preparation in unsanitary conditions , or from contaminated water			0
the average length of a male worm is 29mm and the average length of a female is 59mm			0
the most common symptom in an infected human is the sensation of the worm moving around the mouth			2
symptoms do not tend to develop until about six weeks after infection			0
the worm usually starts off in the oesophagus and then burrows its way into the mouth where it remains until it is removed			0
in most cases the parasite is removed , either by surgeons , or by the patient			0
if the worm is not extracted , symptoms can continue for up to a year .			0
