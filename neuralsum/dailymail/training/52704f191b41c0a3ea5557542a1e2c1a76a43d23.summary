a drug - resistant ' superbug ' that is notoriously difficult to treat has been discovered in the waters where @entity6 's @entity5 sailing events will be held			1
scientists have warned of a danger to swimmers from the contaminated water , with the so - called @entity12 enzyme being notoriously difficult to treat			2
those who come into contact with the bug can require hospitalization , or in some cases , become carriers of the micro-organism , researchers claim			1
among the spots is where the river flows into the city 's @entity26 , site of the 2016 sailing and wind surfing events			1
bacteria with the @entity12 enzyme are difficult to treat			0
however , the institute said no instances of infection resulting from the contaminated water have yet been detected			0
the study 's co-ordinator , @entity45 , said : ' the illnesses caused by these micro-organisms are the same as those caused by common bacteria , but they require stronger antibiotics and , sometimes , can require hospitalization			1
' since the super bacteria are resistant to the most modern medications , doctors need to rely on drugs that are rarely used because they are toxic to the organism			0
' carriers can take these resistant bacteria back to their own environments and to other people , resulting in a cycle of dissemination , ' said the institute , which is affiliated with @entity28 's @entity66			1
small boats sit on the polluted shore of @entity26 , across the bay from @entity6 , @entity28 pictured is @entity26 where the ' superbug ' was discovered , with @entity6 's famous @entity73 towering above it with some 70 percent of sewage in the city of 12 million going untreated — and flowing , raw , into rivers , onto beaches and into the @entity26 — the state of water quality has been a major worry ahead of the 2016 summer games			1
in their @entity5 bid , organizers pledged to slash by 80 percent the amount of sewage and garbage that 's pumped into the bay daily , but critics insist little has been done			2
water quality tests still show sky - high levels of fecal matter throughout much of the bay , and authorities have a near - blanket standing recommendation against swimming on any of its beaches			2
@entity99 beach , where the super bacteria was discovered , is among the @entity26 beaches considered unfit for swimming			0
the beach , which is adjacent to the @entity102 , the starting point for the @entity5 sailing events , is also to be the viewing area for the events			2
@entity107 , a former member of @entity109 's @entity5 sailing team who represents athletes in two sailing disciplines , called the findings ' serious for our athletes			1
' garbage lies on the banks of the badly polluted @entity26 @entity25 organisers have pledged to slash by 80 per cent the amount of sewage and garbage that is pumped into @entity26 ( pictured ) on a daily basis ' we 're going to be troubled by this , ' he said , adding he did n't think the possible health risks would dissuade sailors from taking part in the games			1
' i think the sailors are probably going to cross their fingers they are n't going to get sick			0
' the super bacteria were discovered in three out of five samples taken from along the course of the @entity33			0
it 's not entirely clear how the bacteria may have gotten into the river			0
' the first point in which we detect its presence was ... after the river passes through areas with homes and hospitals , ' @entity138 said			0
organizers of the @entity25 games declined to comment , saying they would have to look into the findings before responding .			0

scientists detect drug - resistant bacteria in @entity25 's @entity5 sailing waters
those exposed to the enzyme it produces can require hospitalization
researchers say swimmers could become carriers of the micro-organism
@entity25 's water quality has been a major concern for 2016 games organisers
about 70 per cent of the city 's raw sewage is pumped into the water
