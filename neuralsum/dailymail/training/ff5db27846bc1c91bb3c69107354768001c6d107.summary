it may look like a @entity1 that has been involved in a nasty accident , but this slanting roofed building is actually the ultimate ecohome			0
the house , which was designed by @entity8 's @entity7 on @entity9 and architecture firm @entity10 , produces more than three times more energy than it needs			1
built in @entity13 , @entity8 , this prototype for what could become the homes of the future , has a roof covered in 1,614 square feet ( 150 square metres ) of solar panels to produce electricity			1
the roof of the @entity22 has been angled to the southeast to capture as much sun as possible the roof has been slanted at exactly 19 degrees and is angled towards the south east to ensure that it can capture as much sunlight as possible and also incorporates thermal solar panels for heating water and uses rainwater collectors for use in the toilet and in the garden			2
the windows are also designed to capture as much sunlight as possible to help keep the home warm while heat exchangers warm incoming air and tap water			1
the designers claim that the house should produce @entity44 of electricity from its solar panels each year while solar collectors used for heating water gather a further 4,000 kwh annually			2
in total is produces enough energy to boil a kettle 185,600 times			0
however , the building needs just 7,272 kwh per year - the equivalent of boiling a kettle 58,000 times			0
perhaps surprisingly for an energy efficient home , it also includes a swimming pool and a sauna			1
the water for the pool and shower is heated using surplus heat from inside the building while the sauna is heated using firewood			2
the house also features an outdoor dining area made from recycled timber and has a vegetable garden to enable small scale food production			0
each floor has a single radiator that is capable of heating the entire house			2
each room also has sensors to ensure that air and light is directed to those that are being used			1
@entity10 , which also designed the @entity80 september 11 @entity81 at the @entity82 , claims that the house can also use energy from geothermal wells - drawing heat up from underground			1
they claim it should produce enough surplus energy to run an electric family car			0
@entity8 researchers and architects have designed the house to meet the needs of an average family without connecting to the grid the house has been constructed from materials to make as little impact on the environment as possible many of the materials used to construct the house have been chosen to make as little impact on the house 's carbon emissions as possible			1
@entity10 said : ' the volume of the house describes a single family house , however , the building is intended for use as a demonstration platform			0
' the house has a characteristic tilt towards southeast and a sloping roof surface clad with solar panels and collectors			0
the outdoor dining area ( left ) has been built with recycled wood and timber to give the house a cabin - like feel the outdoor pool is heated using excess heat drawn from inside the house while the sauna ( left ) uses firewood ' these elements , together with geothermal energy from energy wells in the ground , will serve the energy needs of the family house and generate enough surplus to power an electric car year - round			1
' the project has a strong focus on retaining home - like qualities through non-quantifiable properties			0
' emotive comfort and sense of well - being have governed the design process to the same extent as energy demands			0
' the grounds employ a variety of spaces that can be enjoyed year - round			0
' the roof is covered in photovoltaic panels to produce electricity and thermal solar cells to heat a water boiler @entity10 insists it has tried to use building materials that both make the house attractive and energy efficient			1

@entity8 researchers designed the house with a solar - powered roof in *colaboration* with architects firm @entity10
heat exchangers use excess energy to heat the outside swimming pool and the house even has its own sauna
each floor has just one radiator and each room has sensors to ensure that light and heat is directed efficiently
it produces @entity171 of energy a year but requires just @entity173 to run
