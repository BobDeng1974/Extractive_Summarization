by @entity0 at just a few days old and on his first adventure outside of his underground burrow home , it 's little wonder that this tiny prairie dog pup overindulged on tasty snacks and needed to lie down			1
surrounded by fresh fruit and vegetables that were almost as big as them , the pup and his siblings were n't shy in tucking in to their lunch while out playing with their mother			1
two of the siblings even nibbled on the same lettuce leaf as they enjoyed their healthy meal			1
