@entity4 wants players who have the energy and fitness levels to suit his high - intensity style the purchase of @entity26 from @entity27 has not worked out as either party would have liked having sold @entity29 to @entity30 , chairman @entity31 spent £ 68million on proven internationals in @entity33 , @entity26 and @entity34 — but they have failed to impress , and the club are prepared for a major loss if they can offload @entity26 and @entity34 in the summer			1
@entity4 has shown his penchant for signing hungry and unproven talent ; the captures of @entity40 , 18 , @entity41 , 21 , and @entity42 , 21 , are testament to that			1
@entity33 has also been disappointing for the north @entity45 club having arrived from @entity46 @entity0 already have a youthful look with @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 all under 26			0
@entity55 trio @entity54 , 26 , @entity56 , 25 , and @entity57 , 25 , are among the club ’s targets , while @entity62 ’s @entity61 and @entity63 centre back @entity64 , both 22 , are also on @entity4 ’s radar			0
