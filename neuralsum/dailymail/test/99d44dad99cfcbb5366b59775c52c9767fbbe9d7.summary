following @entity3 's interview on wednesday , in which he said he was not ready to sign a new contract at @entity5 , blogger @entity6 of @entity7 gives the view from @entity9			1
while i hate to use social media as a gauge of opinions , @entity3 ’s interview did n’t go down well at all			1
it was ill - timed and , regardless of what @entity3 and his agent hoped , he did n’t come across very well			1
some of his answers only fuelled the fire really			0
i ’m hoping that that was n’t the whole point , as we ’ve seen these sorts of situations engineered by agents before			0
the interview has almost certainly changed the way the fans feel about him			2
there will be a lot of fans that are of the opinion : ‘ let him go ’			2
obviously , with the caveat that we get our money ’s worth ! @entity3 returns to @entity5 training after the international break and shakes hands with manager @entity43 @entity3 risked angering @entity5 fans after he said in an interview he was not ready to sign a contract @entity3 trains ahead of the weekend 's game with @entity48 it ’s always disappointing when a young player gets his head turned , but there ’s a sense of ungratefulness about the whole situation , considering how the club has nurtured him and paid him well throughout			1
personally , i think he has the potential to be worth so much more than the £ 100,000 - a - week contract he ’s turned down			2
but it ’s only that : potential			0
at present , he ’s arguably in the top five best young players in the world but , obviously at his age , he ’s also prone to bouts of inconsistency and prolonged poor form			0
he has n’t been great recently and was awful against @entity69			0
@entity3 has been linked with a move to @entity48 - the team he is preparing to face at the weekend @entity3 played for @entity71 in the 4 - 0 @entity73 qualifier against @entity74 and while i ’d be willing to see the club give him £ 100k a week – possibly £ 120k a week - the club should n’t do everything it can to keep him			1
@entity5 fans have a popular mantra : no player is bigger than the club			1
admittedly , we stretch the rules for truly great players ( @entity86 , a recent example ) but @entity3 is nowhere near			1
if he wants out , i ’m sure the club will handle it the way they have before			2
frustration over @entity3 ’s situation has been building for a while , and many fans are now of the belief that if he wants to go he ’s welcome to			1
personally , i do n’t like players holding the club to ransom			2
he has as much chance of winning trophies here as he does anywhere ( other than money - rich clubs such as @entity101 or @entity102 )			0
@entity3 did not have his best game in a @entity5 shirt during the defeat at @entity69 @entity5 fans have a mantra that no player is bigger than the club if @entity3 was to move to @entity48 then it would not go down well with @entity5 fans but if he does end up going , he ’s worth a lot more than many established players			1
his ability is so raw but he has almost limitless potential			0
at the moment , we ’ve seen it in fits and starts but even so , he ’s easily worth £ 25 - 30 million			0
if i was @entity120 , i ’d hold any interested club to ransom , though – double it			2
but a move to @entity48 would n’t go down well			0
perhaps better than if it was @entity101 or @entity69 , but honestly there ’s little @entity48 can offer that we ca n’t			0
sure , they ’re more financially stable but what – in terms of trophies – do @entity48 have to show for the last 12 years ? @entity3 speaks to the @entity130 and reveals he is not ready to sign a new contract i think we ’re somewhat ahead on that front			1
much like @entity133 , any move to @entity48 will be more about location than anything else			0
people have drawn comparisons with when @entity86 wanted to leave for @entity48 , but the situation is different			1
@entity86 says he wanted @entity141 football and we were n’t offering that at that time			0
not only that , but @entity86 was an established top - class player at the time , one of the best in the world			2
@entity3 is purely potential and , given all the club have done for him ( cliched , as that sounds ) , it makes little sense			1
if he ’s going to be nurtured into the world - class talent he can become , it wo n’t happen at @entity48			0
it may not necessarily happen at @entity151 either , but a manager like @entity43 will give him the best shot of improving to that level over the next two to three years			1
