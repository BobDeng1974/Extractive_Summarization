more than a century after it was first observed by astronomers a star has been identified as the oldest yet seen in the universe			1
the star is just 186 light years away from @entity5 and is at least 13.2 billion years old , and quite possibly many millions of years older than that			1
the @entity7 is calculated by scientists to have taken place about 13.77 billion years ago and the star , known only as @entity11 , was among the earliest stars to form			1
an artist 's impression of how the oldest known star in the universe might look ' we believe this star is the oldest known in the @entity21 with a well determined age , ' @entity17 , an astronomer at @entity18 , told the @entity23			0
because it contains some heavy elements it is thought to have been one of the second generation of stars to be created following the @entity7			0
the first generation of stars contained hardly any elements heavier than helium but when they exploded in a succession of supernovas within a few hundred million years after forming they were replaced by stars like @entity11			1
observations from the @entity39 helped researchers fix the distance of the star from the @entity5 with unprecedented accuracy which allowed them to make more accurate measurements of how brightly it shines			2
once its brightness was established they were able to work out how rapidly its hydrogen is being exhausted and so determine its age			0
when stars start running short of hydrogen they start dimming which is regarded as a reliable indicator of age			0
an image revealing the universe 's temperature differences 380,000 years after the @entity7 the actual age that the astronomers ’ calculations gave was 13.9 billion years but calculations of this type usually contain large error margins			0
in the case of @entity11 the error margin was 700 million years , making it at least 13.2 billion years old			2
one other star , known as @entity70 , has previously been shown to be 13.2 billion years old but the research team are confident they have determined @entity11 ’s age with greater certainty .			2

star known as @entity11 has been observed for more than a century
it formed within the first *600* million years of the @entity7
@entity5 lies just 186 light years away from the oldest known star
