as comebacks go , this was roughly comparable to watching your favourite singer return to the stage in the twilight of their career - and finding they can barely hold a note			1
the best thing about @entity12 ’s eagerly awaited return on thursday was that he got to the 18th green and was neither limping or clutching his back			1
his golf ? oh dear			2
an opening tee shot that sailed out of bounds was shocking enough but to see the man who has played more great chip shots than any man in history cold - duff no fewer than four during his 18 holes was positively toe - curling			1
@entity12 tees off at the fifthhole during the first round of the @entity26 tournament @entity12 tees off on the seventh at @entity26 event , where he shot a five - over round of 77 woods began with a woeful tee shot on the first hole and only made one birdie throughout his round in an 18 - man field at the @entity26 , @entity12 finished 18th after a decidedly unheroic opening round of 77			1
woods told pgatour.com : ' it was weird			1
i did n't feel like i hit it that bad			2
my short game was awful , and i did n't make anything			2
it was just one of those days where nothing went my way			2
' i hit a lot of good shots and i got nothing out of it , obviously			1
bad chips , bad putts and a couple of missed shots on the front nine on the wrong side really compounded the problem			2
' i hit terrible chips - that 's something i need to work on when i get home			1
it certainly is surprising that i could hit chips that poorly			0
' it left him a mile behind @entity63 , as the remarkable 21 year old @entity64 continued from where he left off on sunday , when he won the @entity66 with a brilliant final round 63			0
he stood six under for his first round , while @entity69 , twice a winner of this event , shot a fine 68			1
to be fair to @entity12 , there were plenty of sound reasons for putting this horror round down to rust and lack of competitive edge			1
it ’s four months since he last played but it ’s at least twice as long as that in reality , given there were plenty of issues with his back long before he finally gave in to reason last august			1
goodness , did it show			0
yet in the build - up there were plenty of pundits who expected him to turn in a good first round			1
for a start , physically he looked great			0
he played in the pro-am on wednesday , shot two under par , with the fluid , remodelled swing under new coach @entity99 drawing rave reviews			1
@entity101 has an awkward follow through after playing a chip shot on the seventh hole @entity12 looks out at the course during his comeback round at the @entity26 tournament @entity63 continued his electric form at the @entity26 on thursday with a six - under 66 the @entity110 venue is a course he ’s played hundreds of times since he used to live next to the driving range			1
so to his opening blow			0
over the years we ’ve seen some amazingly bad opening tee shots from someone so good			2
at the @entity66 in 2003 he lost a ball , which took some doing on a hole lined by 10,000 people			0
at the masters he once missed not only the first fairway but the adjacent ninth as well			0
at the 2006 @entity125 he finished in a lake that was n’t on the radar			0
here was another spectacular contribution			0
an easy par four with a 40 yard wide fairway , @entity12 hooked it so badly it sailed out of bounds , finishing in the swimming pool in someone ’s backyard			1
now that ’s what you call a water hazard			0
woods did make a birdie with his provisional ball to limit the damage to a single dropped shot but another miss to the left on the difficult par three second meant a bogey - bogey start			1
at the 7th he failed to get out of a greenside bunker			0
at the 8th , after almost finding another backyard with another errant approach , he stubbed a chip that barely travelled a foot			0
the resultant double bogey , followed by a rare par at the 9th , meant a front nine played in 41 shots			1
on a course where he once shot 59 for 18 holes			0
by that stage he was already ten shots behind @entity63			0
@entity12 wipes his face on the third tee during the first round of the @entity26 @entity101 ( right ) talks with new swing coach @entity99 ( left ) during wednesday 's pro-am competition @entity169 was also making his comeback after being out for the same time as @entity12 , and shot 67 over the back nine there were some encouraging signs			1
the swing certainly looks far more natural and , after hitting just one fairway on the front nine , he started locating some on the inward half			0
at the 12th , his approach almost finished in the hole for a tap - in birdie			2
another looked likely at the par five 13th , when his second shot landed just 10ft from the hole			2
but , as all @entity110 members know , there ’s a slope here that throws the ball off the green to the right if you ’re too aggressive , and that ’s what happened			0
from there , @entity12 clunked not one chip shot but two , and walked off with a shattering bogey six			1
when he did it again at the 16th , he looked ready to explode			0
it ’s going to take some time , is n’t it ? meanwhile , 46 - year - old @entity169 was also playing his first round since the @entity199 in august			2
he breezed round in 67 .			0

@entity12 made four bogeys and a double bogey in five - over - par 77
it is @entity12 ' first event since a back *injury* *derailed* his 2014 *season*
woods had said he ' felt good ' in the pro-am before the tournament
