by @entity0 deaths from liver disease have soared by 40 per cent in a decade and will continue to rise because of heavy drinking and unhealthy eating , a report warns today			1
liver disease kills 11,000 a year in @entity7 despite the fact that major causes such as alcohol misuse and obesity are preventable , it says			1
figures show that a third of sufferers have obesity - related non-alcoholic fatty liver disease			1
alcoholic liver disease is also responsible for two in three of all alcohol - related deaths			1
it accused @entity7 of ditching plans to produce a strategy for tackling liver disease after three years of work by experts and charities			1
@entity38 mp @entity37 , who chairs the group , said the report is ‘ a wake - up call for the nation ’			0
he added : ‘ liver disease is the only one of the @entity44 ’s top five causes of death where death rates continue to rise and there is no national strategy to tackle this			1
‘ unless urgent and co-ordinated action is taken now , in less than a generation , liver disease has the potential to be the @entity44 ’s biggest killer			1
as most liver disease can be prevented , this is a tragic waste of life			2
’ the three main causes of liver disease – alcohol misuse , obesity and viral hepatitis – are preventable and if detected early most cases are also treatable , says the report			1
it adds that deaths from liver disease are steadily increasing in the @entity44 , while dropping among our @entity65 neighbours			1
‘ even more disturbing is the fact that the average age of death from liver disease is only 59 and continuing to fall , ’ it says			1
easily preventable : figures show that a third of sufferers have obesity - related non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in addition , an estimated 216,000 people in the @entity44 are infected with hepatitis c , which can also cause liver disease			1
however , there is a ‘ postcode lottery ’ for liver disease services in the @entity7 , with ‘ vastly differing standards of care for patients depending on where they live ’			2
the poorest are more than twice as likely to die from liver disease as the better off , says the report			2
it recommends a minimum 50p unit price for alcohol and the co-ordination of a national approach to preventing disease as well as ensuring better care and early diagnosis			0
action is also needed on obesity and eliminating hepatitis c in the next 15 years , it says			0
public health minister @entity100 announced in december that @entity7 had no plans to publish a liver disease strategy			2
the @entity103 has predicted that spending on combating liver disease will reach £ 1billion a year within the next decade			2
@entity106 , chief executive of the trust , said : ‘ liver disease is a national scandal and more must be done to prevent , diagnose and treat the condition			2
‘ we can not sit by and allow so much needless suffering and death			0
we need decisive action now			0
’ @entity113 , chief executive of the @entity114 , said : ‘ there is so much more that could be done to prevent the escalating death toll from liver disease			0
for example , only 3 per cent of hepatitis c patients receive potentially life - saving treatment each year			0
with the new treatments , we could effectively eliminate the virus in the @entity44 within a generation			0
‘ the government , @entity125 and all parts of the @entity7 urgently need to prioritise action on the causes of liver disease			0
’ the @entity129 said : ‘ eating too much and drinking too much alcohol over time can do terrible damage to the liver			0
‘ this is why the government is taking comprehensive action to tackle the issue , through alcohol risk assessments at @entity137 , access to alcohol liaison nurses in hospitals and working with industry to help reduce fat and sugar in foods and to remove a billion units of alcohol from sale			0
‘ we have given local authorities the power , freedom and the funding to tackle the public health issues – such as obesity – that blight their local areas			0

a third of liver disease sufferers develop the illness through obesity
two in three of all alcohol - related deaths are caused by liver disease
deaths from liver disease are rising in @entity44 as they fall elsewhere
