by @entity0 i 've got a brand new training method for my abs and pecs – firing 70mph baseballs at them			1
sounds a bit painful and , frankly , it is			1
you simply stand in the nets in front of a baseball pitching machine and take it like a man when the ball hits you in the chest			1
if you do n't believe me watch the video below			1
i do n't think it 's likely to catch on as a new fitness craze - and kids please do n't try this at home			2
although , thinking about it , it 's unlikely that many people will own a baseball pitching machine – but you know what i mean			2
interval training , press - ups , squats , burpees , sits , leg raises , crunches , swimmers – basic gymnast conditioning exercises , high intensity with only 10 - 20 second rests in between reps			2
i pop a couple of @entity55 in the morning then do 50 minutess of this physical torture on the roof			2
only problem is that we 've had to do this pretty early in the morning as there 's been a crazy heat - wave over here up to @entity65			0
one time we tried the work out at midday and nearly collapsed from dehydration			0
you can see me and @entity40 post-work out with tv presenter @entity69			0
@entity0 and @entity40 have been keeping up their fitness levels in @entity72 , here they are pictured post work - out with tv presenter @entity69			1
so my advice is if you want to do the @entity55 high - intensity circuits – do it early in the morning or late afternoon			0
then you will be ready for a bit of body baseball			0
so we 've finished our job in the @entity31 making made in @entity72			1
all is left to do is the wrap party – which is clearly going to be huge – i 'll let you know all about that next week , if i remember any of it			0
everyone from the cast is de-mob happy now and looking forward to the last few days in this amazing city			0
enjoying the sun ? @entity40 takes a selfie in the @entity33 heat @entity0 and @entity0 let their hair down during their final days in @entity33 we have made an amazing tv show and we 've made some new best friends here			1
morale could n't be higher here and there 's been a lot of fun and light - hearted japery - you can see me having a floppy hair length competition with @entity0 ( he won clearly and he 's very proud of his locks , geddit ? ) so , we are coming back soon , so watch out @entity109 , we 're coming home			1
lots of love , @entity113 lots of love , @entity113			0

@entity0 has *officially* finished filming in @entity33
