the @entity0 revealed that traders have caused three steep rises in the cost of petrol this year alone speculators and ‘ shady middle men ’ are driving up petrol prices , a damning report reveals today			1
as the scandal of alleged price - fixing by major oil companies deepens , the @entity0 reveals how traders are hitting fuel prices – causing three steep rises this year alone and increasing the cost of filling up a family saloon by £ 5			1
few of the traders ’ names – including @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 – are known to consumers outside the oil industry , but their effect on @entity26 ’s 33million motorists and the wider economy is profound			1
they buy huge quantities of petroleum on the open market and store it until the price goes high enough to make them a handsome profit , at which point they sell			0
industry experts say motorists have been fleeced by an average of at least £ 2,000 each and probably much more over the past decade because of the alleged price - fixing now under investigation			1
but watchdogs should also ‘ shine a bright light ’ on the activities of speculators chasing ‘ inflated short - term profit ’ , says the @entity0			2
the row comes after @entity50 investigators raided the @entity52 offices of oil companies @entity53 and @entity54 on tuesday as part of a price - fixing investigation			1
the @entity0 says a major international report highlights how the oil markets in @entity59 had been hijacked by middle - men whose actions increasingly determine the price paid at the pumps			1
the respected @entity64 says : ‘ increased @entity59 reliance on trading houses and third - party suppliers may also leave a growing share of @entity59 supply in the hands of market participants with a different set of incentives than those of refiners			0
’ @entity77 mp @entity76 , who has called for an investigation into alleged cartels and market manipulation in the oil market for the past three years , said there must be a full inquiry			1
traders such as @entity19 buy huge quantities of petroleum and store it until the price soars and then sells traders , like @entity18 , are not known to consumers but have a profound effect @entity26 's 33million motorists the @entity92 has chronicled the scandal over several years – highlighting in november 2009 how tankers full of oil were parked off the @entity26 coast waiting until the price went up			1
now , says the @entity0 , the middle men , or ‘ third party suppliers ’ , have their own tanks to keep the fuel in storage until the price goes up , making the trade ‘ less visible ’			2
@entity0 spokesman @entity105 said consumers needed to be assured that the ‘ middle men ’ were playing fair by the rules – but there was no way of knowing			2
he added : ‘ the @entity111 and competition watchdogs should shine a bright light on the spivs , shady middle men and speculators driving up prices by operating in the shadows of oil giants like @entity54 and @entity53			0
‘ they are just the tip of the iceberg			0
there are a lot of companies operating in these markets of whom most @entity26 consumers have simply never heard			0
@entity26 petrol consumption fell to a record low this year and the @entity0 said the ' warning signs could n't be clearer ' ' they include @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , and @entity21			1

their activities have a huge impact on the prices paid at the pumps			0
but who are they ? ' what exactly do they do and how do they do it ? consumers have a right to know			0
’ @entity0 head of public affairs @entity148 added : ‘ the latest swing in petrol prices is the third 8p to 10p - a - litre “ price shock ” in 12 months , adding up to £ 5 to the cost of filling a typical fuel tank – from £ 66 to £ 71			1

‘ the warning signs could n’t be any clearer , ’ the association said			0
the @entity0 ’s own fuel price report said : ‘ these investigations are a significant development , perhaps a turning point , in getting to the bottom of what drives the price of fuel on @entity26 forecourts			2
’ @entity21 ’s initial response to calls was ‘ no comment ’ , but when given the full outline of the report , a spokesman said he would seek further clarification			2
@entity19 and @entity18 did not want to comment .			0
