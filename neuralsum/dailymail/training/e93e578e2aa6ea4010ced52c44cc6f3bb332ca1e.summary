a 33 - year - old man has spent five years and $ 100,000 in an effort to look like his hero - teenaged pop idol @entity2			1
@entity4 is a songwriter from @entity5 who has used @entity2 's youthful features as the inspiration for numerous surgeries , including face fillers , a chin reduction and eyelid surgery			1
@entity13 's obsession with his appearance began when he started having treatments to prevent his hair thinning at the age of 23 , but really took off when a pre-pubescent @entity2 hit the big - time in 2008			1
write caption here face time : a fresh - faced @entity4 10 years ago ( left ) ; and now ( right ) after $ 100,000 of surgery to look like @entity2 @entity13 , along with hordes of preteen girls , became enamored of the pop star			1
' once @entity2 shot to fame his face was everywhere and i all i kept thinking when i saw his picture was , " i want to look like him , " ' @entity13 says			1
@entity13 had already spent $ 8,000 on hair transplants to supplement his thinning blond locks , but he was n't happy with the results			0
he took a picture of @entity2 to his plastic surgeon to demonstrate exactly how he wanted his hair to look			1
' it took three transplants and a total of $ 21,000 to accurately lower my hair line , close off my temples and grow back my bangs , ' he says			0
once he had perfected his @entity2 - style hair , @entity4 , who admits to a phobia of aging , decided he was n't finished			1
teen idol : 33 - year - old @entity4 wants his face to resemble @entity2 's ' by using @entity2 ’s charming baby face as my inspiration , i ’ve been able to restructure my entire look to maintain a much more youthful appearance through plastic surgery			1
' @entity13 says he admires @entity2 for his youthful good looks , if not his musical output			2
' i did n’t necessarily listen to his music or fawn over him as a celebrity , but his face was just so flawless every change i made was modeled after him			0
' in this quest , @entity13 has remodeled his features so that he bears little resemblance to the fair - haired , pleasant - featured man he was before his surgeries			0
after his successful hair refurbishment , @entity13 had his face and lips plumped up with filler to look more youthful			0
next , he had @entity69 and @entity70 injections in his forehead and temples			0
in 2012 , he spent $ 4,850 on eye surgery to lift his upper eyelids			2
' but it took going to eight different surgeons before anyone would agree to operate on me as everyone thought i was crazy to be obsessing over such a tiny detail , ' he says			0
his most recent procedure , a three - part smile surgery , has literally turned his frown upside down in an effort to emulate his 19 - year - old idol ’s boyish smile			2
popular in @entity88 , smile surgery has doubled in the @entity89 in the past year			0
' when i first sought out to look like @entity90 only paid attention to specific aspects of his boyish look like his hair and the structure of his face , ' says @entity4			2
resemblance ? @entity4 acknowledges that he needs a few more procedures before he 'll be considered @entity2 's ' doppelganger ' ' but the more i started studying @entity2 and young people in general it ’s really their smile that gives them their youthful glow			1
if you look closely , you ’ll notice that when younger people just barely have their mouths open they naturally show their top teeth , giving them a sort of natural and effortless smile			0
' for $ 30,000 @entity13 's @entity113 plastic surgeon lifted his upper lip , turned out his bottom lip and turned up the corners of his mouth to give him a ' perma - smile			0
' he also had liposuction on his chin to smooth out his smile and had the fat from his chin transferred to his hands , lips and under his eyes			0
even after a total of $ 100,000 worth of plastic surgery to look like his baby - faced idol , @entity4 says he still has n’t achieved his dream look			1
' i know there is more work to be done in order to make a full transformation into @entity2 ’s doppelganger like a nose job and jaw reduction , which my surgeon has suggested			2
' @entity13 proudly relates a story about being turned away from a liquor store recently because the staff did n't believe he is 33			0
although @entity13 's similarity to his teen idol is n't immediately obvious even after spending $ 100,000 worth of surgical procedures , he says he does get mistaken for @entity2			1
' between our similar hairstyles , baby faced smile and overall youthful appearance i finally look like @entity2 and i could n’t be happier about it , ' he says .			2
