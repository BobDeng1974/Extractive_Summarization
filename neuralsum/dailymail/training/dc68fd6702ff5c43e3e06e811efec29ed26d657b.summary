by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 manager @entity2 offered little sympathy to @entity5 following their desperate attempt to persuade @entity7 to give up their @entity9 slot			1
the @entity11 champions were thrown out of the competition for fielding an ineligible player in the second leg of their 6 - 1 third qualifying round clash with @entity2 's old side			1
the @entity19 outfit have now been given a second chance of landing a £ 20million jackpot and a slot in the competition 's group stages after they were handed @entity5 's play - off round place			1
let off ? @entity7 were handed a @entity9 lifeline despite losing 6 - 1 on aggregate to @entity5 rules are rules : former @entity7 boss and current @entity3 manager @entity2 has no sympathy for @entity5 keep your heads down , boys : @entity7 have been accused of ignoring calls and emails from @entity5 ineligible : @entity36 ( right ) was deemed to be playing illegally , seeing @entity5 stripped of their place but on sunday , the angry @entity11 held a press conference and even released an open letter to the @entity41 as they questioned the honour of the club 's hierarchy			1
they have demanded a rematch in order to decide who faces @entity49 but @entity2 insists @entity5 will have to take their punishment			1
' that 's the rules , ' said the @entity54 boss			2
' it 's the same in golf			0
if it 's a windy day and the ball moves or oscillates as you 're addressing it , that 's a penalty			0
' every sport has its rules and you have to stick by them			0
but most of us have all been hit by these rules somewhere along the line			0
' @entity7 thought their @entity9 hopes were over after sustaining a crushing 4 - 1 defeat in @entity71			1
it was just new boss @entity74 's third match in charge but when @entity5 blundered by playing the suspended @entity36 , the @entity76 was handed a reprieve			1
now @entity2 has tipped the former @entity79 manager to bounce back from the pounding his team took in the @entity81			2
embarrassing : @entity7 had crashed out after losing 2 - 0 at home to the @entity11 club following defeat away reprieve : @entity7 have refused to accept @entity5 's pleas to give up their place in the next round he suffered a humiliating 5 - 0 thrashing by @entity90 in his first match as @entity7 boss back in july 2007 but went on to become the first @entity19 manager since @entity94 to win three @entity96 titles in a row			1
@entity74 's predecessor @entity98 , meanwhile , suffered @entity100 set - backs during his first full season in charge but lead his side to a famous win over @entity105 and the @entity9 last 16 a year later			1
' i 'm still looking at the team - sheet to see how many of the team in @entity109 are ineligible , ' joked @entity2 , whose side failed to progress despite a 4 - 0 win in the @entity19 return			1
' i will need to get @entity113 to go over that just in case i 'm due a bonus for getting through to the next round			0
' but getting over a bad result like that can be done			0
@entity118 had a poor start and did well and these things are sent to test you			0
' everyone in football will have their character tested but we wish @entity74 the best of luck			2
' speaking at @entity129 as the third intake of youngsters were welcomed into the @entity134 's @entity133 system , @entity2 also reflected on a summer that has seen three @entity96 youngsters seal big - money moves			1
give him time : @entity2 thinks new @entity7 manager @entity74 ( pictured ) can make a success of the job success : @entity2 won three @entity96 titles despite a terrible start to his tenure in the @entity9 unhappy : @entity5 manager @entity144 was unhappy to see his side kicked out of the competition @entity148 's @entity147 clinched a £ 3m switch to @entity150 , while @entity152 team - mate @entity151 moved to @entity153 for £ 2.85m			1
@entity155 's @entity154 has also landed a £ 800,000 transfer to @entity157 but @entity2 would rather see his nation 's best talent stay north of the border			2
' it would be better for me if we had the finances in this country that nobody would need to move , ' he said			0
' @entity166 told me four or five years ago that there were 70 - odd players who had played in the @entity169 that were now playing in the @entity170			2
' if we had kept them here , just think what a fantastic league we could have			0
' the trouble is if you develop good players , people want to buy them			0
they do well then £ 100millions worth ( of talent ) moves on			0

' what i would like to see in years to come is @entity194 , @entity105 , @entity195 buying our players again			0
that would be better for everyone			0
' open letter : @entity5 co-owner @entity200 , has asked for a one off game to settle the issue			2

@entity5 fielded an ineligible player in second leg of third qualifying round
@entity7 lost to the @entity11 champions 6 - 1 on aggregate but advanced
@entity5 attempted to persuade @entity7 to give up their @entity9 slot
@entity2 says ' that 's the rule ' and ' you have to stick by them '
*ex-celtic* boss believes @entity74 can still make a success of job
@entity2 is *encouraged* by the development of @entity96 players
