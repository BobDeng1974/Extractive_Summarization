the @entity54 - based firm has alreday been paid millions from the public purse			2

’ inquiry chairman sir @entity68 said the statement was ‘ of very considerable significance ’			0
last night colonel @entity71 , who commanded @entity3 forces in @entity73 , said : ‘ many in @entity4 and @entity73 have sought to discredit @entity3 soldiers for political purposes or have made claims for personal financial gain			1
‘ in some cases , these people have been wittingly or unwittingly looking to turn a quick buck at the expense of our fighting troops			0
‘ it is tough for the @entity52 , who are under great pressure to answer these cases , but to avoid wasting public funds we must be ready to make stronger rebuttal			0
’ former infantry officer @entity92 , an independent mp , said : ‘ this drives a coach and horses through the very texture and core of this case			0
@entity100 's father is pictured here with a photograph of his son ‘ i do wonder if our enthusiasm for prosecuting our own soldiers has been excessive			0
this has left the nation poorer and demoralised our @entity110 ’ morale			0
’ a @entity112 source said : ‘ the taxpayer has been led a merry dance by @entity115 whose charlatan clients have , it seems , simply falsified accounts – all underpinned by public money			0
human rights lawyers have cost taxpayers a staggering amount of money			0
’ mr @entity51 , 57 , has made his name pursuing @entity3 soldiers through the courts over alleged war crimes in @entity4			1
he has represented alleged victims of abuses by troops , including relatives of @entity130 , who died in 2003 in @entity3 custody			1
on @entity73 , mr @entity51 led a legal case that ended with a 2010 @entity135 block on the transfer of detainees from @entity138 to the @entity73 authorities , compelling the @entity3 military to keep @entity142 prisoners in detention			2
he was awarded the title ‘ @entity145 ’ in 2004			0

it was named after @entity165 , 19 , one of those who died			0

in a statement , @entity185 , of @entity50 , said : ‘ from the outset , the families have had the simple objective of discovering the extent of any wrongdoing and , if so , how it came about and who was responsible			0
