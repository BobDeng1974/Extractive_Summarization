@entity1 captain @entity0 hailed the controlled bowling at the death as his side claimed a dramatic three - run win over @entity6 at @entity7			1
@entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 kept it tight to restrict @entity6 captain @entity12 , as the visitors finished three runs short of @entity1 's 180 for seven			1
' throughout the whole game guys have held their nerve very well , ' @entity0 told @entity17			0
over the line : @entity19 celebrates as the ball is fielded securing a win for @entity1 that had looked unlikely final act : @entity12 hits the last ball of the innings , knowing that anything but a boundary is n't enough ' we got ourselves a very good score but we felt with the calibre of batsmen @entity6 had if they did get going they would be hard to stop			1
' right at the end @entity8 , @entity10 and @entity9 held it together really well			2
there 's very little margin for error when @entity12 ( @entity12 ) is at the crease			2
there were some nerve - racking times but they were great			0
' @entity0 revealed @entity1 's bowlers learnt from @entity6 's mistakes on the @entity7 pitch			1
beauty : @entity44 can do nothing to keep out a fabulous yorker from @entity9 as @entity1 fought back out of the ground : @entity0 found @entity6 's low full tosses easy to hit and got his team to bowl a little shorter ' we found when we batted the fuller ball whether it was a yorker or a full toss was easy to hit , ' he said			1
' we went back to what we thought they should have bowled			0
' it did play pretty well			0
we all expected it to turn square but it did n't			0
it actually played quite nicely and @entity6 bowled reasonably well but to get up to 180 was really good			0

@entity1 beat @entity6 by three runs in one - off *t20*
@entity12 fails to hit boundary off final ball to win match
@entity10 , @entity8 and @entity9 bowl well to restrict *tourists*
earlier @entity0 had smashed *71* in @entity1 's 180 - 7
