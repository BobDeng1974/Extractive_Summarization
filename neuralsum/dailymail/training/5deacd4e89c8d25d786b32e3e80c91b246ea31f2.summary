a mother who is documenting her three - year - old autistic son ’s journey to forming a bond with his pet labradoodle through a series of heart - warming photos says she ’s already spotted things in common between the adorable pair			1
‘ they both like to chew things and confined spaces , ’ @entity9 , 29 , told @entity10			0
and little @entity14 thinks pet @entity15 makes a great pillow : ‘ @entity15 has got that really lovely fleece and @entity14 likes how it feels			2
you will see @entity14 rubbing his feet all over @entity15			2
’ when the cheeky three - year - old was diagnosed with autism this year @entity9 said she was heartbroken but not surprised as she ’d had concerns about his speech since he was a toddler			1
that ’s when she came across 12 - month - old black labradoodle @entity15 through @entity46 , an @entity47 charity that trains assistance dogs for special needs children			1
‘ they try their best to match the dog to the child , so they would n’t put a hyperactive dog to a hyper child like @entity14 , ’ @entity9 told @entity10			1
‘ @entity15 is a pretty sedate dude as far as dogs go			0
’ the highly - trained @entity45 was put into training for six months , housed with a foster family and sent to puppy bootcamp before he took on his very important role of helping @entity14			1

‘ he ’s never sitting still , he ’s got a very cheeky sense of humour , he 's a very strong non-verbal communicator even though he ca n’t talk , and he ’s strong willed			0
’ as well as autism , @entity14 also has a sensory processing disorder and has been in speech therapy since an early age			0
‘ his brain does n’t interpret sensory stimulation the same , he craves movements and deep pressure			0
he would run full pelt into a wall and not slow down just to get that sensory feedback , spinning in circles and hand flapping , ’ @entity9 explained			0
@entity15 has come as a relief to the family , because he ’s an extra pair of eyes to watch over @entity14 and is even a trained tracker			1
‘ @entity15 watches him wherever he goes , if @entity14 goes walkabout he can track him , ’ the mother - of - two said			2
@entity9 described the @entity101 and poodle cross as a bit of a ' primadonna ' @entity14 , who has difficulty communicating verbally , enjoys a cuddle with @entity15 while he plays on his ipad @entity15 went to puppy bootcamp to learn how to be a fully - trained autism assistance dog @entity14 's mum @entity9 said he likes walking with a harness with @entity15 but also likes to hold her hand the family were given four days with a trainer as part of the handover of @entity15 : ‘ they teach you how to handle him			1
' as a certified assistance animal we have legal requirements to meet like making sure he is appropriate in public , not sniffing in supermarkets or trying to eat food in café ’s and not going to toilet in public			0
’ although the labradoodle is still a puppy - with a weakness for tennis balls - @entity9 said he is ‘ unbelievable ’			0
‘ he toilets on command … but @entity15 was the first labradoodle that they trained			0

the family had to raise a minimum of $ 15,000 of his $ 25,000 cost before they could bring him home and @entity9 received huge financial help from her sister and the local community			1
she even sold some of @entity14 ’s ‘ beautiful ’ artwork to help raise the money			0
@entity14 and @entity15 ’s bond is slowly developing but @entity9 said she tries not to worry about the time it takes because @entity14 ‘ did n’t even realise his sister was alive until she was 12 months old and walking ’			1

‘ he will pat and give a little cuddle but they have n’t had a huge chance yet … it can take to six / eight months			0
he ’s developmentally around 18 months so he has n’t got the language skills for me to explain “ this is @entity15 this is what he does ” , ’ she reasoned			2
one of @entity9 ’s fondest moments since @entity15 joined their family was when @entity14 curled up with him ‘ and used him as a pillow ’			1
‘ @entity14 initiated it and @entity15 is still getting used to @entity14 because @entity14 is an incredibly random child but @entity15 did n’t even flinch when he got in the doggy bed			2
