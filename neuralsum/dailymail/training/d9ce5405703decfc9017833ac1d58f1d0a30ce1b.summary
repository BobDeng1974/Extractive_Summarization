while @entity1 and @entity2 hobnobbed with @entity3 and sir @entity4 at the @entity5 last night , in @entity6 , a very different awards ceremony was taking place			0
as the winners of the annual @entity9 were announced , a small band of hardy celebrities , among them @entity12 and @entity13 , were in the audience			1
and they had certainly dressed up for the occasion , with @entity13 , 53 , opting for a dramatic @entity17 - style column dress , while @entity12 , 46 , plumped for a frock that shimmered with sequins			1
but not everyone was so restrained			0
@entity33 , a singer with 1970s band @entity34 , opted for a glittering number that could have come straight from a theatrical costume department			0
just as colourful was home secretary @entity38 , who joined the party in a turquoise shalwar kameez and a bright red pair of flat pumps			1
the @entity9 have become something of an institution since being launched by businessman @entity45 in 2005			2
dubbed @entity47 's ' @entity46 ' , they recognise the efforts of chefs and businessmen alike and recognise restaurateurs who have made a real difference to the @entity47 's gastronomic scene			1
support : also at the event were @entity27 mp ( left ) , @entity56 and @entity57 ( right ) powerful backing : home secretary @entity38 mp also turned out to show her support looking good : mrs may opted for a colourful shalwar kameez and a pair of bright red pumps politicians , among them the prime minister and @entity67 , regularly attend the event , and the @entity69 sends a yearly message congratulating the winners on their culinary efforts			1
this year 's victors include @entity75 's @entity74 , which won the @entity76 , and @entity77 , who was handed the @entity80 gong			0
speaking during the awards ceremony , founder @entity45 said : ' @entity82 may have been born in @entity83 but now @entity47 curry has truly a place in the hearts and stomachs of people throughout the land			2
' it started in the early 60s with curry and chips			0
in those days it was the chips that broke down the barriers and @entity97 or @entity97 proved the masculinity of ‘ real men ’ before they washed it down with a few pints of lager			0
' when we started the @entity9 in 2005 we were criticised for calling curry " @entity47 "			1
' i am happy to take the blame for the changes in perception that have taken place since then because today @entity47 curry dishes such as @entity111 have an identity all of their own and are known and admired throughout the world			2
' eye - catching : @entity33 stood out in sequins while @entity25 was more low key			0

@entity12 , 46 , and @entity13 , 53 , were at the @entity9
they were joined by home secretary @entity38 and @entity27 mp
the annual awards celebrates the efforts of @entity47 restaurateurs
