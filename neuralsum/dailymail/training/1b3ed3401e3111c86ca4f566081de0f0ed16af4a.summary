by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ oliver_todd click here to register - for free - and start picking your £ 100million squad now ... as part of the build - up to the start of @entity1 's @entity9 season , we will be taking a look at players new to the @entity12 with the potential to light up @entity15 's top tier over the coming campaign			1
@entity17 in a nutshell @entity17 showed enough of his potential in his limited pre-season appearances to leave @entity22 fans drooling - and if he can match anything like the expectations he is building up , he is sure to be a @entity12 star			1
the midfield maestro was a £ 4million signing from @entity29 club @entity28 last month and adds another string to @entity32 's bow in the @entity22 midfield with his ability to spray passes around and to supply the ammunition for the likes of @entity38			1
the @entity39 is just 21 years old but is already setting a big reputation - and it wo n't be long until he is unleashed on the @entity12 after securing a spot on the bench away at @entity44			1
he is fast becoming a fans ' favourite at @entity48 due to his tough combative style - although that could have @entity9 managers worrying a little about the red and yellow cards he could pick up			2
ready ? @entity17 will be hoping you back him in @entity1 's @entity9 game this season getting used to it : @entity17 is one of the most exciting young stars heading to the @entity12 this season born : @entity58 , @entity59 , september 10 1992 ( age 21 ) position : central midfielder previous clubs : @entity64 , @entity28 2010 - 2012 : @entity64 ( 3 appearances , 0 goals ) 2012 - 2014 : @entity28 ( 47 apps , 1 goal ) @entity69 2014 appearances : 3 @entity71 : 91 % successful @entity72 : 90.91 % interceptions : 2.33 per game stats from @entity76 why you should have @entity78 in your @entity79 @entity32 likes to get his teams playing with the ball on the floor - and that should give @entity83 the perfect opportunity to prosper and rake in the @entity9 points			1
@entity17 is an exciting player but with the physical knowhow to prosper in the @entity12			1
priced at just £ 5.9million in the game he represents a bargain when you consider that 's below the price level of the likes of @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			2
@entity97 @entity17 found himself in the heart of midfield for @entity39 as they just lost out at the group stage of the @entity69 - impressing in particular against eventual runners - up @entity102			2
for his country he often found himself sitting very deep in midfield and robbed of the opportunity to showcase his passing in quite a defensive side - but that should n't be such a problem at @entity48			0
but how will he pick up points ? @entity17 might have the tendency to sit a bit deeper in midfield than most but fear not ... with @entity32 not known for a lot of rotation he should get plenty of appearance points once he establishes himself in the side , a few key contributions to goals and likely win bonuses at @entity22 should sort him right out			1
skills : @entity17 has the control and quick - thinking to add @entity125 to @entity22 ' midfield ca n't stop him : @entity17 is willing to fight for every ball in the middle of the park - let 's hope he gets no bookings ! do n't just take our word for it @entity17 has already left a great impression on @entity32 , with the @entity22 boss saying the @entity39 is feeling right at home at his new club - which obviously bodes well for bedding in easily to the @entity12			1
' to play in our midfield it ’s not enough just to be tactically aware how to contain the opposition , ' @entity32 said			0
' @entity142 has got a very natural balance about knowing that he can be strong and aggressive but in the same way he ’s a technical player on the ball			0
i think that ’s why the fans took to him so quickly , because he ’s very complete			0
' the biggest aspect that surprised me was @entity142 ’s ability to get on the ball , control things and spray it about			0
when he ’s adjusted we ’ll see his best football shine			0
the mentality he showed at the @entity69 was incredible for his age			0
' @entity142 is at the perfect place to show what he can do now			0
he ’s an exciting prospect			0
' passing range : @entity17 sprays a trademark long pass - something @entity38 could prosper from			2

@entity22 signed @entity17 from @entity28 for £ 4million in july
@entity83 *boasts* the pace , power and skill to succeed in the @entity12
@entity170 looks at why @entity17 is worth £ 5.9m in our @entity9 game
