but now it seems that you can change people 's perceptions - just by choosing the right foundation			0
speaking to the @entity12 , @entity11 neuroscientist dr @entity10 revealed that imperfections can distract the brain , with the result that people with less than flawless skin are ranked lower on the social scale than they otherwise might be			1
what 's more , make - up can also help boost your chances of success in everything from career to love , if @entity10 is to be believed			1
essential : make - up can make you appear more trustworthy , likeable and attractive to other people according to the scientist , who has authored a number of studies reflecting on the links between make - up , appearance and the way people perceive others , the ' social triangle ' - the area from the eyes down to the mouth - is key to success			1
' all the social information is in the centre of the face , ' explains @entity10			0
' if the brain is distracted by imperfections [ such as spots ] , it processes less and so has a weaker social assessment of the person it is looking at			0
' @entity10 's contention is backed by a 2011 study by beauty giant @entity55 that looked at how people reacted to women of all ages and ethnicities in and out of make - up			1
according to @entity63 , the lead scientist , those who wore make - up were seen as more likeable , trustworthy , attractive and competent			1
@entity64 shows off flawless skin but @entity67 's heavy make - up could make her seem untrustworthy flawless : concealer can help reduce brain - distracting imperfections - boosting social capital in the process even those with thick make - up , although considered less trustworthy , were still thought to be more attractive and competent than those wearing nothing at all			1
this is something with which @entity78 , a leading make - up artist , can agree			2
' i think make - up is a bit of a calling card because it 's the first place you look , ' @entity79 told the @entity12			2
' if someone is wearing too much make - up , it can affect the way people talk to them , especially in the workplace			2
bad make - up just looks terrible and can be a hindrance : poorly applied and matched foundation or false eyelashes worn to the office , for example , is too much of a distraction			0
' the solution ? keep it light , do n't forget the bb cream and save make - up free days for the weekend .			0
