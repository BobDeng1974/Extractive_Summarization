' this decision has been taken in consultation with the @entity63			0
the safety and security and of its passengers and crew is the airline 's highest priority			0
' @entity19 said a cabin crew member will temporarily enter the cockpit if the pilot or co-pilot needs the toilet			1
the airline will not have a third trained pilot on board			2
and a spokesman for @entity91 said : ' we always ensure we have the highest safety standards and , while it is our common practise to have two members of our crew in the flight deck at all times , in light of recent events we are now in the process of formalising this to be policy			2
' the change is also being implemented by package tour operator @entity105 , whose spokesman said : ' we are adapting our procedures to ensure there will always two people in the cockpit			2
' an aviation industry insider said : ' there is some industry chatter about the policy becoming mandatory			1
' budget airlines @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 , which flies from airports in the @entity122 , @entity116 and @entity117 , said they already had policies to ensure two crew are in the cockpit at all times			1

' a @entity120 spokeswoman said : ' this rule has been in place for a number of years to ensure the safety and security of our customers			1
' while a @entity168 spokespman said their @entity170 ' states that two members of crew are to be present in the cockpit at all times during flight '			1
@entity176 and @entity177 declined to comment , while @entity118 were unavailable			2
elsewhere around @entity139 , the continent 's third - largest budget carrier , @entity31 , said it would require two people in the cockpit at all times for safety reasons			2
a @entity63 spokesman said : ' following the details that have emerged regarding the tragic @entity6 incident , we are co-ordinating closely with colleagues at the @entity188 ( @entity188 ) and have contacted all @entity190 operators to require them to review all relevant procedures			0
' all @entity190 airline pilots undergo extensive and regular medical assessments to determine their fitness to hold a licence			0
as part of this , aeromedical examiners are required to assess a commercial pilot 's mental health at each medical examination which , for an airline pilot flying with at least one other pilot , is undertaken annually			2

long haul flights usually have more than two crew capable of flying the plane because shift changes are often required in flight			0
a spokeswoman for @entity147 carrier @entity260 , parent company of @entity6 , said : ' a crew member may temporarily leave the cockpit during a specific phase of the flight			0
' so far , no decision has been taken to change the procedure as it is already approved by the @entity147 office of federal aviation but we will look into it			0
so far , we trust our procedure			0
it also transpired today that the @entity6 co-pilot who flew the plane into the @entity11 at 400mph had to stop his training because he was suffering from depression and ' burnout '			1
mr @entity18 - whose family were at the scene of the crash in @entity279 today - postponed his pilot training in 2008 due to mental health issues and a friend said he was ' in depression '			1

at an extraordinary press conference earlier , @entity220 prosecutor @entity221 gave a disturbing account of the cockpit voice recordings extracted from black box			0
he said @entity18 locked his captain out after the senior officer left the flight deck			1
at that point , @entity18 used the flight managing system to put the plane into a descent , something that can only be done manually - and deliberately			1
he said : ' the intention was to destroy the plane			0
the plane hit the mountain at 700kmh ( 430mph )			0
' i do n't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds '			0
earlier in the flight , mr @entity221 said @entity18 's responses were initially courteous , but became ' curt ' when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing of the plane			2
the captain - named by local media as @entity147 father - of - two @entity148 - then left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter			2
mr @entity221 said : ' we hear the pilot asking the co-pilot to take over and we hear the sound of a chair being pushed back and a door closing so we assume that the captain went to the toilet or something			0
' so the co-pilot is on his own , and it is while he 's on his own that the co-pilot is in charge of the plane and uses the flight management system to start the descent of the plane			0
' at this altitude , this can only be done voluntarily			0
we hear several shouts from the captain asking to get in , speaking through the intercom system , but there 's no answer from the cockpit			0
