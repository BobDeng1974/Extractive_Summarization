he appeared on the show to respond to a @entity38 report which stated the number of students being suspended and expelled from public schools has skyrocketed in the past year			0
however when mr @entity23 posed a question about the most effective form of punishment past or present , and made it clear he was not alluding to physical punishment such as the strap saying ' you 'd never advocate bringing that back surely ? ' , dr @entity9 paused and chuckled before he started his answer with a hesitant ' well ... '			1
he referenced his own experiences at school , recalling a teacher who would most likely lose his job in this day and age , but described his punishment methods as very effective			2
he told of his own school experience and described the method as very effective in an interview with @entity11 although dr @entity9 followed up the comment saying the time has passed for corporal punishment , he reinforced his point saying if the school community is behind the idea then he would take no issue with it			1

' the cane or the belt should not be brought back into our classrooms , ' @entity129 senator @entity132 said			0
