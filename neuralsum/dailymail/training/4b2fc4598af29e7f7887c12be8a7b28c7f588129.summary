it was a case of third time unlucky for @entity2 as the @entity4 boss once again failed to get the better of @entity5 – the man who once mentored him in his roles as academy and reserve - team coach at @entity10			1
@entity4 took the lead after @entity13 ’s strike deflected in off @entity14 with nine minutes gone but @entity14 then struck at the opposite end five minutes later before @entity16 scored the decisive goal midway through the second half			0
@entity2 lost both outings against @entity5 last term , and the @entity4 boss would have been desperate to avenge the 2 - 0 defeat they suffered at the hands of the @entity24 which ultimately cost his side their first title in more than two decades			1
@entity5 and @entity2 share a joke on the touchline during @entity4 's clash against @entity10 @entity2 greets his former mentor ahead of his side 's lunch - time match against @entity5 's @entity10 @entity2 and @entity5 are sitting in opposite dugouts for the third time - the latter won both matches last term he made seven changes from the side that lost against @entity39 in the week with captain @entity40 , £ 16million @entity42 and @entity43 international @entity41 among those recalled			1
and the home side certainly had the better of the opening exchanges before @entity5 , who drafted in @entity47 to provide @entity10 with a steelier feel , saw his side settle into the match			1
@entity16 ’s strike with 66 minutes gone was no more than the visiting side , who are unbeaten in their opening 11 matches of the @entity56 campaign , deserved			0
@entity2 threw on @entity57 for the ineffectual @entity42 in the closing stages , but the former @entity60 man was unable to have any impact on a resolute @entity10 defence , led by captain @entity63			2
@entity13 's first - half strike deflects in off @entity14 to give @entity4 the lead after nine minutes @entity14 hauls @entity10 level just five minutes later after his header wriggles over the line at the @entity70 end the hosts were unfortunate not to be given a late penalty when @entity40 ’s left - footed strike appeared to hit @entity14 ’s arm			1
but in truth @entity4 did n’t do enough to really test the league leaders and are now already 15 points adrift of @entity5 ’s side			1
in an interview with @entity80 during his time at @entity82 , @entity2 said : ‘ @entity5 was simply a wonderful influence on my career			2
he could n’t do enough to help a hungry young coach			0
‘ he was always interested to hear my opinions and to share his			0
as a young coach , you are forever indebted to people like that , who become such an influence on you			0
’ @entity2 and @entity5 shared a joke and an embrace in the build - up to the lunchtime kick - off ; their respect for one another still clear			2
but their handshake at the final whistle was less amorous			0
it ’s three games and three defeats for @entity2 and his mentor certainly holds the upper hand .			0
