@entity1 presenter @entity0 says her ' close encounter ' with @entity3 remains one of the worst ' eeee - eww ! ' moments of her life as growing numbers of @entity3 's victims come out of the woodwork with increasingly shocking stories of the abuse and intimidation they suffered at the hands of him and other celebrities , a picture is emerging of a climate of routine sexism at the @entity1 during the @entity21 and @entity22			1
already , well - known journalists and presenters including @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 have told of their experiences of sexual harassment and discrimination , while the upper echelons of @entity32 desperately attempt to close ranks and claim , ( unconvincingly , given the natural curiosity hard - wired into most top journalists ) to have shown absolutely no interest in the nitty - gritty of potentially explosive allegations made against one of their most celebrated talents			1
i have my own @entity45 story – a story with a difference , as i was not some impressionable 14 - year - old at the time , but an experienced tv journalist in my early 30s who had already reported on some dangerous situations including the @entity53 and @entity54 riots			1
my ' close encounter ' with @entity3 , however , remains one of the worst ' eeee - eww ! ' moments of my life – leaving me teeth - suckingly embarrassed rather than mentally scarred			1
newly arrived at @entity59 in the @entity22 as a sports presenter on @entity61 , i found myself alone in a lift with him			2
we had met previously in @entity65 while i was covering cricket for @entity67 , and when i helped out on one of his charity walks			2
but he was not a close friend and i had always found him a weird , self - conscious attention - seeker , even creepier than the rest of his fellow djs			1
i exchanged uneasy banter with him out of politeness , only to find him snuggling up for a smooch , complete with oddball sunglasses and wreathed in cigar smoke			1
' it 's our @entity82 , ' he crowed			2
' how about a kiss for @entity84 ? ' bemused and a bit embarrassed , i proffered my cheek in gingerly fashion , only for him to grab my chin and thrust his tongue into my mouth			0
the acrid taste of cigar smoke almost made me retch and i froze , cringing , as he ran one hand up from my waist and fumbled for my breast			1
' do n't be so absolutely ridiculous , ' i hissed			0
' take your hands off me and do n't you ever touch me again ! ' i peeled him off and pushed him away			0
he backed off grumbling that it was just a bit of fun , that i could n't take a joke and was probably frigid			0
i bolted out of the lift furiously , wiping my mouth , trying to rid myself of the taste of him			1
i felt dirty , as though i had somehow ' asked for it ' and replayed the admittedly slightly smutty conversation in my mind			0
after the incident in the lift with @entity3 @entity0 confided what had happened to her friend @entity114 , herself a recent arrival and already a popular newsreader yes , it was laden with innuendo , but on a fairly innocent level and no worse than any of the joky exchanges that were commonplace in most workplaces , particularly television in that era			1
i dashed into the @entity61 office and confided what had happened to my friend @entity114 , herself a recent arrival and already a popular newsreader			0
' of course you did n't ask for it , ' she reassured me , admitting that she had had to fend off plenty of unwelcome advances herself			0
' he 's just a dirty old perv – half the djs are like that			0
' i decided to keep quiet for the sake of my career – @entity3 was then one of the biggest names in showbiz			1
i regarded myself as a serious reporter and i certainly did n't want to be stereotyped as casting - couch fodder or a namby victim who could not stand up for herself			1
there was quite a divide in the @entity22 between the tv presenters and reporters who were university - educated trained journalists – @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 – and the ' old guard ' of former actresses and beauty queens such as @entity155 , @entity156 and others who had been picked for their winsome looks			2
@entity0 , left , with @entity61 presenters @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity151 in the eighties the latter , however capable they really were , tended to be patronised and treated like airheads by the thrusting young @entity168 then running the newsrooms			1
this was why , when i started in tv , as a sports - mad , relatively prudish single woman from a no - nonsense , @entity173 - fearing family , i had deliberately portrayed myself as straight - laced and head - girlish			2
in the late @entity22 and early @entity177 , attitudes to women seemed to be changing rapidly , but yes , there were superstar ' dinosaurs ' like @entity45 ( whose paedophile tastes i was unaware of ) and for some , @entity183 in particular , it seemed a matter of pride to sleep with as many willing and naive girls and women as they could get their hands on			0
an older , established presenter at the @entity1 was known for groping women he considered less than his equals			0
i believe that it is important not to demonise the @entity1 root and branch , by equating the horrors of @entity198 's criminal and manipulative targeting of young , vulnerable children over 40 years , with the sort of low - level , undignified harassment suffered by professional women such as @entity25 , @entity26 and me			2
there is no comparison between the two			0
despite the humiliation and annoyance of our treatment , we adults were essentially capable of looking after ourselves			0
when the hysteria has died down and the requisite number of broadcasting mandarins have fallen on their swords , the furore should , with luck , ensure that throughout the media , there is no longer any room for either paedophilia or sexual harassment – however famous the perpetrator .			0
