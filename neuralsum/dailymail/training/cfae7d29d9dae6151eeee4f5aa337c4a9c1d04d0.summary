by @entity0 @entity1 turned up in the @entity3 town of @entity4 on thursday night on a very important scouting mission			1
the @entity7 manager could cover most of western @entity8 each and every week checking up on the progress of his battalion of loanees , but few in his extended squad are as special as @entity15			1
the 21 - year - old brother of @entity17 has been in spectacular form ever since the unglamorous and unheralded @entity20 outfit @entity19 borrowed him last summer and now @entity1 had come to see if all the positive feedback was true			1
he carefully studied a teamsheet on which just the one name would have been familiar - the man in the all - red strip , wearing the no 10 on his back			0
ahead of kick - off , the home fans behind one goal would have caught @entity1 ’s eye as they unfurled an enormous white banner that covered the stand from pitch to roof			2
next to the face of @entity15 , written in @entity57 , the slogan : ‘ arrived as “ little brother of ... ” leaving as our golden boy			2
’ @entity15 will always be the younger sibling of @entity17 but he ’s been making plenty of noise of his own without having to rely on the reflected glory of his big brother			1
14 goals and 17 assists during the @entity20 season took @entity65 into the six - team @entity66 - off , where they are on the brink of qualifying for next season ’s @entity70			1
on the night of his late - season visit , @entity1 was able to watch @entity15 in action for a full 90 minutes but came away without seeing him find the target as he had done in his last three outings			1
@entity65 went down 2 - 1 to @entity76 , the favourites to win the league when @entity79 ’s complex format of play - offs come to their conclusion this weekend			2
even @entity17 , regarded by many @entity7 fans as their best player following a season of 17 goals and 10 assists , concedes that @entity15 is the better player			1
scout and about : @entity7 manager @entity1 visited @entity79 to personally check on @entity15 's progress mr @entity89 : the winger has impressed during two seasons on loan at @entity79 side @entity19 there is no sibling rivalry it seems , just an appreciation that @entity15 has , or soon will have , the more complete suite of attributes			1
a creative @entity98 , @entity15 possesses well - honed dribbling and shooting skills , a deft touch and close control			2
he has come on leaps and bounds during his second loan season at @entity65 , finding the net far more often and offering more for his teammates			0
his sense of adventure on the field is summed up by this quote from a couple of years back : ‘ when i have two strikers in front of me , i have fewer possibilities on the sides to widen the play			0
@entity117 brother : @entity119 was voted @entity120 after an impressive season at @entity7 ‘ but it ’s easiest to find me and to play deeply			1
it ’s a matter of movement and animation in front of me			0
‘ but in fact , i do n’t care			0
i like to play direct football as much as to build an attack on the sides			0
when you like to play in support of the striker , you have to adapt			0
’ so there you have it - play me wherever you like , i ’ll prosper			0
his form fuelled speculation that he could be on the @entity79 plane to @entity139 with his elder brother			2
in the end , he had to settle for the standby list this time			0
he has played a full part in the under 21s qualification campaign for the @entity145 and it seems a matter of time before @entity147 unleashes him on the world			0
wanted man : hazard has attracted interest from a number of clubs in @entity154 and the @entity155 @entity15 could not have done a great deal more during his loan spell in @entity79			1
the fact @entity1 made a trip just to check up on him suggests there ’s every chance he ’ll be at @entity162 next season			1
now he has to prove he can cope in the @entity155			0
but if he is truly the better hazard sibling , then that should n’t be much of a problem .			0

@entity7 **youngster** @entity15 has been impressing on loan with @entity79 club @entity19 - scoring 14 goals and making 17 assists
the 21 - year - old is considered by some as a better prospect than older brother @entity17
@entity1 has travelled to @entity79 to make a personal check on rising star @entity15
the **youngster** could *return* to @entity162 next season
