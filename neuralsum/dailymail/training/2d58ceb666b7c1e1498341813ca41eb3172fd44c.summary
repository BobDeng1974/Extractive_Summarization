a report said had @entity3 known about @entity5 ’s messages , @entity2 ’s murder could have been avoided the family of @entity2 today accused @entity7 of failing to help stop his killers as it emerged the social network has still not handed over data from five accounts opened by one of his extremist murderers			1
his sister @entity16 said the internet giant had ‘ blood on its hands ’ because it had hosted exchanges between one of the soldier ’s murderers and an @entity23 extremist , in which the former said : ‘ let ’s kill a soldier			1
’ however , the social network ’s staff failed to tell @entity3 about the ‘ graphic and emotive ’ posts from @entity5 , made just six months before the atrocity took place			1
incredibly , @entity7 had already disabled seven of his accounts – five of which were flagged over links to extremism – without informing security services			2
the damning report by @entity44 ’s @entity43 released yesterday also revealed that @entity5 had 11 @entity7 accounts but @entity46 has still only been given the contents of six			1
it said in ' over a year since the murder of fusilier @entity2 , @entity46 has not received all the information requested			0
having not seen the content of the other five accounts , @entity46 can not be certain that there is no evidence of attack planning in the rest of these accounts '			0
but civil liberties campaigners fear @entity2 's appalling murder is being used as ' an excuse to justify the further surveillance and monitoring of the entire @entity64 population '			1
and former @entity66 director @entity65 said today it would be ' almost impossible ' and ' unfair ' for businesses like @entity7 to hand over terror related activity to the security services			1
he told the today programme : ' i think it 's unfair to ask companies to make that decision			0
i think there has to be a legal basis for them so they know what they are to do and what not do to '			0
@entity84 added it was ' almost impossible ' because of ' legalities ' and because there are 125million posts a day on @entity7 passing on terror - related posts would be an ' enormous job '			1
fusilier @entity2 ’s sister , @entity91 , 25 , said : ‘ @entity7 have my brother ’s blood on their hands			1
i hold them partly responsible for @entity2 ’s murder			1
' i suppose it has given me someone to blame but i ’m not sure that ’s what i wanted			0
knowing it could have been prevented and it was n’t prevented			0
i blame the failings of @entity3 and the internet companies			2
mainly the internet companies ’ twisted : @entity2 's killers @entity107 ( left ) and @entity5			1
@entity7 hosted exchanges between @entity5 and an @entity23 extremist , in which the former said : ‘ let ’s kill a soldier ’ @entity107 shows a bloodied hand and knives following the murder of soldier drummer @entity2 in @entity116 on may 22 , 2013 response : former @entity66 director @entity65 said it would be ' almost impossible ' and ' unfair ' for @entity7 to hand over terror related activity but @entity120 claims : ‘ it is their social responsibility to act on this ' in a long - awaited report , @entity44 ’s @entity43 yesterday said that had @entity3 known about @entity5 ’s messages , @entity124 ’s murder could have been avoided			1
and in a damning indictment of @entity131 - based tech firms , it said the same mistakes could have been made by websites run by @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 or @entity138 , which have become a ‘ haven ’ for terrorists			0
@entity2 's step - father @entity141 said : ‘ we are left with questions			1
the report does n’t do what it ’s supposed to do			0
it has brought back memories - a lot of the feelings are back and it does n’t give the correct information as to the reason the delays happened			0
‘ the companies ’ duty of care to its customers is to use information like that if necessary when the discover it '			0
@entity120 said the internet companies – once frequently courted by his government – were being ‘ used to plot murder and mayhem ’ , adding : ‘ it is their social responsibility to act on this ... we expect them to live up to it			1
’ the murdered soldier 's family said today that the prime minister is the only person with the answers they need			1
@entity172 said : ' he 's the only one who has the full report and probably the only one who could get the answers that we want '			0
heartbroken : the family of @entity2 , pictured after the trial of his killers , blame the security services and particularly internet companies like @entity7 for not preventing his death files : @entity107 's profile compiled by secret services detailing his movements and associates in the years before he murdered @entity2 background : @entity5 had fewer convictions than @entity107 but it was his interest in extremist material and posts on @entity7 that has sparked debate over whether social networks should have told @entity3 and @entity66 the prime minister ’s official spokesman said today : ‘ any meeting they ask for they will get			1
’ talking about the affect his brutal murder had on his family he said : ‘ when we are together as a family we laugh about memories of @entity2			2
but we all have difficulty talking about the murder and what has happened since			0
we are a normal family drawn into this situation			0
‘ we have lost a son but we have never been able to mourn @entity2			2
' the loss of @entity2 will never go away			0
you learn to live with it over time , but it 's still with you over time			0
former home secretary @entity214 said there was a ‘ cultural problem amongst the leadership of some of these [ sites ] who have got a distorted libertarian ideology , who believe that somehow this allows them to be wholly detached from responsibility ’			0
miss @entity91 told @entity227 newspaper : ‘ it is totally clear from this report that information so vital could have alerted our security services to this terror plot			2
’ the @entity43 criticised both @entity3 and @entity66 for a string of blunders when tracking @entity237 ’s killers , @entity5 and @entity107 – but , controversially , it insisted that given what the agencies knew at the time , they could not be blamed for failing to prevent the murder			1
this is despite the fact that : an application for intrusive surveillance on @entity5 in 2013 took ‘ nearly twice as long as it should have ’ amid internal wrangling by @entity3			2
home secretary @entity246 signed the warrant only after @entity237 was dead			0
however , the @entity43 ’s 191 - page report also highlights an exchange on @entity7 between @entity5 and a fanatic since codenamed @entity251			2
@entity5 expressed his desire to murder a soldier in retaliation for @entity64 military action in @entity256 and @entity257 , and was advised on different methods of murder			2
announcing £ 130million in funding to help the fight against ‘ self - starting ’ terrorists , the prime minister declared : ‘ we must not accept that these communications are beyond the reach of the authorities or the internet companies themselves			1
their networks are being used to plot murder and mayhem			0
’ but @entity273 of @entity274 said : ‘ the @entity43 shamefully spins the facts , seeking to blame [ websites ] for not doing the agencies ’ work for them			0
’ executive director @entity280 , of the @entity281 , said : ' to pass the blame to internet companies is to use @entity237 ’s murder to make cheap political points			1
' the committee should not use the appalling murder of @entity124 as an excuse to justify the further surveillance and monitoring of the entire @entity64 population , ' he said			1
a senior internet industry source told the @entity293 there has been a ' coordinated ' attempt by the security services ' to attack @entity131 - based technology companies in particular '			2
a @entity7 spokesman said : ‘ like everyone else , we were horrified by the vicious murder of fusilier @entity2			2
we do n’t comment on individual cases but @entity7 ’s policies are clear – we do not allow terrorist content on the site and take steps to prevent people from using our service for these purposes			0

@entity7 has failed to give @entity46 5 of @entity5 's 11 accounts
staff also failed to tell security services about ' graphic and emotive ' posts
@entity5 said to @entity23 extremist on @entity7 : ' let 's kill a soldier '
@entity2 's family say the blame lies with @entity3 and internet companies
sister @entity91 said : ' @entity7 have my brother ’s blood on their hands . i hold them partly responsible for @entity2 ’s murder '
civil liberty groups say ' appalling murder ' should *n't* be used as ' an excuse to justify further surveillance and monitoring of the entire @entity64 population '
*mps* accused of ' spin ' to divert attention from failings of @entity3 and @entity66
former @entity66 director says it would be ' almost impossible ' and ' unfair ' to expect businesses like @entity7 to pass on terror - related material
step - father @entity141 demands answers from @entity120 and says : ' we have lost a son but we have never been able to mourn @entity2 '
prime minister 's spokesman says *mr* @entity120 is happy to meet the family
between them , @entity5 and @entity107 were subject to no fewer than seven intelligence *investigations* ;
@entity66 showed a ‘ *deeply* *unsatisfactory* ’ lack of interest when @entity107 was caught in @entity360 trying to join @entity362 terrorists ;
