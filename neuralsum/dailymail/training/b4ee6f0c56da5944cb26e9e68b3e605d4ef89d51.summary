at @entity2 last wednesday , @entity1 manager @entity0 turned to the fourth official and asked him : ‘ what ’s the * * * * * * * point of having that if you do n’t * * * * * * * tell him			0
’ it was over something innocuous , debating whether @entity11 should have been awarded a corner in the moments leading up to @entity15 ’s team scoring their third in this @entity18 replay			0
managers at the very highest level of the game have had enough of this lottery , frustrated by the match officials ’ seemingly random decisions			1
sadly the modern training methods used by clubs in the @entity27 means that the game is drifting further and further away from the referees			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 ( left ) was left frustrated with decisions during the match with @entity11 @entity0 did not believe @entity11 should have been awarded a corner in the build - up to @entity35 ' goal referee @entity36 was the official on the receiving end of @entity0 's frustrations last week @entity39 ( right ) seemed to go down easily under @entity41 's challenge to win a penalty @entity43 captain @entity41 stood his ground and @entity39 appeared to fall easily over his leg replays show referee @entity47 appearing to be looking at where the ball is and the off - the - ball action @entity51 ( left ) puts a right footed penalty past the diving @entity54 to give @entity55 the lead from the spot the official that night at @entity2 was @entity36			1
at 35 he is something of a spring chicken compared with @entity61 ( 52 ) , @entity62 ( 51 ) , @entity47 ( 46 ) or @entity63 ( 43 ) , but what chance do they really have of keeping up with 20 @entity27 outfield players for 90 minutes ? the answer is none			1
last weekend ’s round of fixtures in the @entity27 brought another fresh round of debatable decisions , all of which could be solved with the assistance of some video technology			1
even @entity77 admitted that @entity55 had been fortunate to earn a penalty at the @entity79 on sunday when @entity39 collided with @entity43 captain @entity41			1
at @entity81 , @entity62 failed to spot @entity1 ’s @entity82 throwing @entity84 defender @entity83 off the ball ( and off the pitch ) for @entity1 ’s second goal			0
@entity88 appeared to handle at @entity89 during @entity91 ’s impressive victory over @entity92			2
on monday evening at @entity94 , @entity93 could easily have been awarded a another penalty when @entity97 defender @entity96 appeared to throw @entity98 into the goal during the 0 - 0 draw with @entity101 ’ team			1
the reality is that we are asking a group of guys , most of them in their mid-thirties upwards , to make the correct calls when they are on the move			0
at least in tennis and cricket , both fast moving sports , the officials are stationary when they make a decision , and they usually have the benefit of video technology for further assistance			1
the @entity27 is operating in an era when the game ’s speed merchants can run sub- 11 - second 100 metres and there is n’t a top referee in world football who can keep up with the sprint kings			1
it is little wonder then that referees , who can not recover aerobically in anywhere near the same time as a 20 - something player in peak physical condition			2
they can not keep up			0
the test for international @entity134 referees has changed in recent years from a 12 - minute continuous test around a running track in which the official had to run 2,700 metres			2
since then it has moved on , split into two sections designed to test speed and endurance			0
the first tests speed , with referees given a running start to complete six 40m sprints in less than six seconds , each with a 90 - second recovery			1
a @entity27 player would not even break sweat			2
a test for stamina is the second part of the elite referees ’ test , with 10 laps of the 400m track ( 10 x 150m in sub- 30secs ) with a recovery in between			0
that ’s meat and drink to a @entity27 player			2
in the past , various studies have indicated that fatigue plays a part in the ability to make cognitive decisions			1
@entity27 referees , tiring in the second half of the game , are most likely to make errors as the clock ticks down			1
despite the inconsistencies , change seems a long way off because it will need six of the eight members of the @entity176 to vote in favour of technology			0
four of the board members are from @entity180 and the other four are picked from each home nation			0
it took an age for the goalline decision system to be approved , but it is rarely called upon			0
the bigger decisions take place in other areas of the field			0
on sunday , after @entity55 ’s ultra-impressive victory over the defending champions at the @entity79 , @entity77 admitted he was in favour of video assistance for offsides and fouls			2
referees ’ chief @entity197 and the recently - retired @entity198 have visited @entity199 recently , where the a trial system is in place for the fourth official to use video technology			2
@entity88 went unpunished for this clear handball despite referee @entity206 having a clear view @entity92 's @entity208 protested to referee @entity206 , who waves his appeals away despite @entity208 's impassioned appeals to the official , @entity92 were not awarded the penalty replays clearly showed @entity215 to be inside his own half as he ran clear to score a disallowed goal the @entity219 's celebrations were cut short when assistant @entity220 inexplicably flagged for offside @entity84 were frustrated by @entity222 ' goal as they thought there was a foul by a @entity1 defender @entity97 's @entity96 ( left ) clearly has both hands on @entity93 striker @entity227 ( right ) @entity96 appears to make clear contact with @entity98 inside the area at @entity94 on monday night @entity98 is on the verge of falling inside the area with @entity96 clearly all over him with both of his arms @entity233 ( right ) remonstrated to referee @entity62 after the official blew just before a @entity84 corner @entity27 footballers , like @entity237 's @entity236 , can run super-fast speeds for long periods top - level officials can not be expected to keep up with @entity27 players for 90 minutes alone @entity243 and other stars are ultra-fit and can keep running at high speeds for extended periods fatigue causes cognitive decision - making to become more difficult , so referees need extra help if @entity77 ’s ideas are to be taken on board , then the ability to use instant replays to determine fouls and , by extension , simulation can only help the game in this area			1
most people would welcome that , particularly in an age when overseas players are being encouraged to protect themselves by refining their falling technique to a ) prevent injury and b ) to win free - kicks			0
this is a modern scourge , one of the biggest issues confronting the game at this moment			0
with the technology in place , it would lead to a far greater understanding of the game			0
referees ' chief @entity197 visited @entity199 to see a trial system where the fourth official used video technology technology would 've been able to assist referees in making difficult decisions at key moments last weekend			1

last weekend 's @entity27 games saw several *controversial* decisions
@entity92 were *denied* a penalty for handball , @entity55 were given a fortunate penalty and @entity93 could have had a second spot kick
managers have had enough of officials ' seemingly random decisions
officials ca *n't* be expected to keep - up with top - level players for 90 minutes
fatigue and tiredness are proven to affect cognitive decision - making
referees should be able to use technology to give them the help they need
