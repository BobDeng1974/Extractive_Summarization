by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:52 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 03:19 est , 12 july 2013 taxpayers were charged tens of millions of pounds for ‘ phantom ’ electronic tags on criminals who were either dead , in jail or had left the country			2
two private firms , @entity8 and @entity9 , are accused of wrongly billing for tens of thousands of tags which had either been removed or simply never fitted			1
estimates suggest up to one in six of the 18,000 tags the @entity14 was billed for every day were not real			1
taxpayers could have overpaid two private companies for their work tagging criminals last night ministers asked fraud investigators to look at @entity8 , after the company refused to allow forensic auditors access to its books and emails between senior executives			1
justice secretary @entity26 took the dramatic step after pledging to recover ‘ every last penny ’ owed to the public purse			1
he told mps the scandal could date back as far as 1999 , when tagging of criminals began in @entity33 and @entity34			0
since then the taxpayer has spent £ 1billion on tagging and monitoring offenders			0
the current contracts began in 2005			0
mr @entity26 condemned the overcharging as ‘ wholly indefensible and unacceptable ’			1
in some cases , bills were paid for months or years after tags were taken off , he said			0
@entity42 just two weeks before the start of the @entity44 , @entity8 admitted it was unable to supply more than 10,000 security guards it had @entity48 and police personnel were drafted in to fill the gap ( pictured above ) , with the company eventually picking up the £ 88million bill			1
@entity54 2011 , two @entity8 workers placed an electronic tag on an offender ’s false leg , meaning he could simply take it @entity59 wrapped his prosthetic limb in a bandage to fool staff who set up the device in his home			1
@entity65 dies @entity67 prisoner @entity66 died in 2010 after being restrained by @entity8 guards on his deportation flight			1
three @entity8 staff were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter but charges were not brought because of a lack of evidence			2
@entity75 2011 , a set of keys went missing at @entity78 , a jail managed by @entity8			2
inmates were locked in their cells for an entire day , and new locks had to be fitted at a cost of £ 250,000			0
he also launched a disciplinary investigation into former officials in the department after discovering contract managers were aware of billing issues in 2008 , but ‘ nothing substantive was done ’			0
details of a ‘ significant anomaly in billing practices ’ within the deals emerged during a routine review as ministers prepared to negotiate contracts for satellite tags			1
it found ‘ charges for people who were back in prison and had their tags removed , people who had left the country and those who had never been tagged in the first place ’ , mr @entity26 said			1
charges were also made in a ‘ small number of cases when the subject was known to have died ’			0
he added : ‘ in some instances , charging continued for a period of many months and indeed years after active monitoring had ceased			0
’ the bill to taxpayers is put in the ‘ low tens of millions ’			0
tags are put on criminals after their early release from prison or as part of their community service			0
most involve a 12 - hour curfew from 7pm to 7am , allowing the criminal , in theory , to work			0
a box in the offender ’s home sounds an alert if the tag goes out of range or stops working			0
audits have also been launched into all other contracts between the government and the two firms , both major suppliers to @entity137			0
@entity8 received £ 1billion in revenue from @entity140 government contracts last year , while @entity9 made £ 2billion			1
@entity9 has withdrawn its bid from the current tendering process for new satellite tags , while @entity8 is expected to be excluded after refusing to pull out			1
@entity9 agreed to co-operate with a new audit but has said it does not believe ‘ anything dishonest has taken place ’			2
@entity8 rejected the new audit and last night a spokesman insisted it has ‘ always complied totally with the terms of the contract ’			2
the @entity152 will consider whether an investigation is appropriate into what happened at @entity8 , mr @entity26 said			1
indefensible : justice secretary @entity26 said @entity8 had rejected a demand for a new forensic audit the firm ’s reputation was shredded last year by its failure to fulfil the security contract for the @entity162			1
thousands of armed forces and police personnel were called in to fill the gap and the company was forced to pick up the tab			0
in may , @entity8 chief executive @entity168 quit with a £ 1.2million payoff			2
several senior managers were sacked in the wake of the @entity162 fiasco			0
the price of shares in both firms plunged yesterday following the announcement , wiping £ 176.4million from @entity8 ’s value and £ 269.6million from @entity9			1
@entity8 group chief executive @entity178 said : ‘ we place the highest premium on customer service and integrity and therefore take very seriously the concerns expressed by the @entity14			2
’ @entity9 group chief executive @entity184 said : ‘ @entity9 is a business led by our values and built on the strength of our reputation for integrity			2
we are deeply concerned if we fall short of the standards expected			0
