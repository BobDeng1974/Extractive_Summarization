by @entity0 clothes shopping has never been anything but a chore for me			1
ever since i can remember , i have been the wrong size			1
even when i was 16 or 17 and at my slimmest , the @entity6 made me feel like a big fat freak			1
the only way to fit into the kind of clothes that were affordable and accessible , it seemed to me , was to eat next to nothing and exercise away every last calorie			1
but even then i never managed to get below a @entity16 size 10 - 12			1
i ’ve never been skinny enough for fashion			1
so , when @entity6 chain @entity19 announced , with great fanfare , that they were rolling out a plus - size range , i was n’t particularly surprised when it turned out that their definition of ‘ plus ’ was a size 12			1
@entity27 dress , £ 295 , @entity28 , £ 30 , nextthis dress feels amazing on ( it ’s wonderful quality ) , and the graphic design makes me feel like i ’m at the opening of some terribly cool art gallery			1
it is a bit shapeless , @entity36 : 5/10 perhaps it might be in other far - flung countries where retailers outsource their manufacturing to , but in the @entity41 a size 12 is definitely not plus			1
you ca n’t blame it all on @entity19			1
the truth is that fashion has never loved women ’s bodies			1
from safety - pin dresses to hot pants , 95 per cent of fashion is designed to suit approximately 20 per cent of the population			1
but those of us who do n’t conform to the fashion world ’s minute proportions still have to buy clothes			1
so , how can women who are a little on the generous side go shopping without having a nervous breakdown ? after decades of trying - on , many tears , and the odd triumph , here is my guide to conquering the @entity6 — and my pick of the best outfits big girls can buy today			1
the first step is acceptance			2
for years , i used to go shopping hoping in vain that somehow , overnight , i might have dropped a dress size			1
and so , my first rule is this : always take a size bigger than you need into the changing room			1
there is nothing more demoralising than having to ask the attendant for a larger size			1
asking for a size down , however , is fantastic			1
better still is popping out of the changing room , doing a quick twirl — and hearing her opine that something is too big			2
‘ do you really think so ? ’ you can say , all wide - eyed and innocent , while internally punching the air with sheer unadulterated joy			2
@entity93 , £ 59 , collection at @entity95 , £ 85 , leggings , £ 115 , @entity97 at @entity98			2
heels , £ 30 , nextthis outfit makes me feel incredibly chic and a little bit @entity103 — which really is all i ’ve ever wanted in @entity104 : 10/10 the second rule is this : make an effort			2
you are going to have to take your clothes off , and if you ’re faced with the same pair of baggy grey pants and ineffective bra every time you strip down , you are going to hate yourself			2
wear your best bra , decent heels and a slip — something confidence - boosting that will also protect your modesty — and a bit of make - up			1
it ’s not a fashion show , i know , but it ’s all about confidence			1
one of the difficulties of being plus size is that you can be so grateful if something — anything — fits , you end up buying all kinds of hideous rubbish			1
so remember : you do n’t have to buy anything , even if you are shopping for a special occasion			1
there ’s always bound to be something tried and tested at home you can spruce up			2
i know that if i ’m in tears , it ’s time to stop , have a cup of tea ( or hell , perhaps something stronger ) and then head to the accessories department			2
a scarf , a pair of earrings , new shoes — all are as good as a new outfit			2
if it ’s been a particularly demoralising trip , i sometimes end up with a new handbag			2
i have a lot of bags			2
lunch with @entity151 , £ 59 , @entity152 at @entity153 , £ 35 , @entity154 fear this one feels rather better than it looks — but it ’s so comfortable i ’m not sure i care			2
the shoes look far more expensive than they really are			2
@entity159 : 7/10 wherever possible , shop alone			1
you might think it will be more fun with a friend , but whenever i shop with a pal , i just end up picking things out for her			1
that ’s because most of my friends are slimmer than me , and therefore much easier to dress			2
shopping with my mother , who is a size 8 and essentially a different species , is a disaster			1
if you ’ve ever watched @entity173 , you ’ll get the picture			2
if things get really tough , there ’s always the internet			2
people bemoan the demise of the @entity41 @entity6 ; i say it deserves everything it gets			1
all those tiny changing rooms and bitchy sales assistants			0
the internet is the fat girl ’s revenge			0
you can order your clothes and try them in the privacy of your bedroom — with no one but the dog to witness your upper arm shame			0
@entity196 ’s changing rooms are possibly the least pleasant in the shopping universe			1
as for its underwear , there is too much choice			1
it ’s confusing , and their sizing is sporadic			0
@entity205 is like @entity206 ( where the @entity207 buys her bras ) , only not as eye - wateringly expensive or quite so majestic			0
it has a great mix of everyday and fancy bras , including those by @entity214 , which are pretty and supportive of even the most impressive bust			0
for tights and hosiery , go to @entity218 for its own brand , which goes up to an xxl , and @entity224 ’s @entity223 range			0
try @entity225 , too — @entity227 ’s @entity226 can work wonders			0
@entity229 is always a bit of a bun fight , but has a very good selection of shapewear			0
best of all , though , is @entity234 , which has stores across the country			0
@entity238 , £ 59 , @entity152 at @entity225			0
jacket , £ 35 , collection at @entity196			0
heels , £ 40 , @entity242 real surprise			0
i look a tiny bit mother - of - the - bride , but the structure of the jacket is great , and it balances out my shape nicely			0
@entity159 : 8/10 @entity152 for @entity225 can be a bit hit and miss , but when she gets it right , she really gets it right			0
this is mainly because her stuff always has decent length			0
good old @entity196 can be great — although it does vary between their own labels			0
autograph does wonderful casual - chic separates , and @entity196 is well cut			1
@entity218 also stocks a great selection of brands that are kind to the midriff and thigh			0
@entity264 and @entity265 are always good and @entity266 by @entity267 is expensive but will make you look and feel both rich and thin			0
for dresses , @entity269 ( mother of @entity271 and @entity273 veteran ) has devised her own range designed for ‘ grown - up women ’			0
the reversible ones are especially useful ( grayandosbourn.co.uk )			0
they wash well , and are great on their own or with layering			0
@entity281 , £ 395 , anna scholz.com			0
t - bar heels , £ 28 , @entity284 stretch silk			0
the neckline and sleeve length are flattering , and well within my comfort zone			0
i ’d wear this time and again			1
@entity159 : 9/10 one of the problems with most evening wear is that it ’s often strapless or sleeveless , which means you end up faffing around with wraps and / or bolero jackets , which are loathsome			1
nothing screams ‘ i ’m hiding my bingo wings ’ more than a bolero jacket			0
if money is no object , head straight to @entity302 , whose clever , on - trend designs have never failed me			0
damsel in a dress , which you can find at @entity218 , does amazing draped jersey dresses , which add a @entity309 edge to your extra inches			0
and @entity312 and @entity313 are both brilliant at dressing curves			0
rather more unexpected is @entity315 for @entity316 at @entity317			0
this is a poor woman ’s @entity319 — albeit , in my view , infinitely more wearable than the new @entity319 range , which only seems to want to cater for women without hips			0
i bought a chiffon and lace shirt for £ 18 there recently , wore it to a lavish political fundraiser with palazzo pants and heels — and two people complimented me on it			1
in a room full of @entity334 ! choose carefully , and you can bag treasures at supermarket prices .			0
