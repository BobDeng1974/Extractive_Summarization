' i can confirm a settlement has now been reached with @entity2 's family , and once again would like to stress our sincere condolences to them			0

' we do not think the standard of care @entity2 received by medical staff at @entity0 was acceptable and more should have been done so he could be with us today			1
' we are pleased that the trust admitted responsibility for the mistakes made during @entity2 's care at the hospital			2
' we have now received a settlement which marks the end of the legal battle , but we just hope that lessons can be learned to make sure that each and every patient gets the care and support they need and that no other families are faced with the horrendous ordeal we are going through after losing our son			2

' @entity2 was born with a number of health problems including a congenital heart condition which required several operations at the hospital			2
he was admitted for surgery on october 11 , 2010 and died two days later @entity2 's mother @entity35 , 44 , said : ' over four years later our family are still absolutely devastated over the loss of @entity2 ( pictured ) - he was a lively and loveable child who brought so much happiness to our lives ' his mother said he was a keen writer and wanted to write books about his experiences to help other children the hospital unit has been under the spotlight ever since it was earmarked for closure , along with one in @entity162 and the @entity163 in west @entity164 , as part of a nationwide plan to streamline children 's cardiac surgery into fewer , more specialised units			1
however , after a fierce campaign and two legal challenges , health secretary @entity170 halted the plan and ordered @entity173 to re-evaluate the whole process			0
in 2013 , shortly after the campaigners ' key legal victory , operations at the unit were suspended for more than a week due to fears over mortality rates and other concerns brought to the attention of @entity173			0
the move provoked huge anger and debate , especially as parents and clinicians from the unit linked it to the continuing controversy about which children 's heart surgery units were to be closed			1
a series of detailed reviews into the unit since that closure has found the centre to be safe , but controversy continues over the future of children 's heart surgery at @entity201 and the other centre in the north - east of @entity173 , in @entity203			2
in relation to the broader issues surrounding the heart unit , chief medical officer dr @entity17 said : ' in october 2014 the final report into the @entity201 children 's heart surgery unit was published			1
' this provided a conclusion to the four independent reviews into the care , mortality rates , governance and family support at the unit , which have taken place over the previous 18 months			0
' no other children 's heart unit in the @entity222 has been the subject of such intense review and scrutiny in recent times			0
@entity2 's mother @entity35 said today : ' we do not think the standard of care @entity2 received by medical staff at @entity0 was acceptable and more should have been done so he could be with us today ' @entity17 , chief medical officer for @entity18 , said the trust wished to apologise for the ' distress and anguish ' caused by his death and the ' errors that were made during his last treatment ' ' it is important to stress the overall conclusions were that the service is safe and running well			1
' as with any report of this nature , a number of recommendations were made about ways in which we could improve the service further and already significant progress has been made in implementing these across the unit			0
' in addition the findings have helped in the development of @entity173 's national standards for congenital heart disease , which are due for publication later this year			0
' the trust has previously apologised to the small number of families where care and support were not to our usual high standards			0
' we have made significant changes to our services to improve this experience and ensure we are as supportive as possible during such a difficult time			0
