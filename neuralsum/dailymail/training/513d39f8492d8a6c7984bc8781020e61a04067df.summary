after 15 years of painstaking restoration , scientists say they are on the brink of solving what sank the @entity5 submarine @entity6 - the first sub in history to wreck an enemy warship			1
considered the @entity11 's stealth weapon during the @entity12 , the hand - cranked @entity6 sank the @entity15 warship @entity13 in winter 1864 and then disappeared with all eight @entity5 sailors inside			1
its remains were discovered in 1995 in waters off @entity20 and five later it was raised to a conservation lab. now with about 70per cent of the hull cleaned of heavy rust , @entity23 , a senior conservator on the @entity6 project , says that crucial clues have been unearthed but ' it 's too early to talk about it yet			1
we have been wanting to do this for many years now			0
we have a submarine that is encrypted			2
it 's like an enigma machine			2
' he said the clues will be studied closely as scientists finally piece together what happened to the 40 - foot submarine that night decades ago			1
the narrow , top - secret ' torpedo fish , ' built in @entity63 , @entity64 by @entity65 from cast iron and wrought iron with a hand - cranked propeller , arrived in @entity69 in 1863 while the city was under siege by @entity15 troops and ships			2
in the ensuing few months , it sank twice after sea trial accidents , killing 13 crew members including @entity65 , who was steering			0
' there are historical references that the bodies of one crew had to be cut into pieces to remove them from the submarine , ' said @entity23			2
' there was forensic evidence when they found the bones ( between 1993 and 2004 in a @entity5 graveyard beneath a football stadium in @entity69 ) that that was true			1
' the @entity11 hauled the sub up twice , recovered the bodies of the crew , and planned a winter attack			0
from a metal spar on its bow , the @entity47 planted a 135 - pound torpedo in the hull of the ship , which burned and sank			1
flashback : this june 15 2011 photo shows the @entity6 before conservationists started the next round of derusting ongoing process : conservator @entity23 works at removing encrustation from the hull of the @entity6 , using tools similar to a dentist purpose - built : the narrow , top - secret ' torpedo fish , ' built in @entity63 , @entity64 by @entity65 from cast iron and wrought iron with a hand - cranked propeller , arrived in @entity69 in 1863 while the city was under siege by @entity15 troops and ships before the collision , a lookout on the @entity13 spotted a bizarre vessel approaching just below the surface - with only its coning tower visible - and sounded the alarm			1
the @entity13 's cannons could n't be lowered enough to fire at the strange craft , so crewmen used rifles and pistols , but these were not effective			0
some historians say that the submarine showed a mission - accomplished lantern signal from its hatch to troops back on shore before it disappeared			1
soon after the signal had been fired , the sub sank about 4 miles ( 6.4 kilometers ) off @entity69			0
more than a century later , in 1995 , the @entity6 was discovered off the @entity20			1
it was raised in 2000 and brought to a conservation lab in @entity36			1
@entity23 has the lantern , which archaeologists found in the submarine more than a century later , in his laboratory			0
scientists removed ten tons of sediment from the submarine , along with the bones , skulls and even brain matter of the crew members			1
they also found fabric and sailors ' personal belongings			0
facial reconstructions were made of each member of the third and final crew			0
they are displayed along with other artifacts in a museum near the submarine			0
in a nearby vault is a bent gold coin that archaeologists also found in the submarine			0
origins of name : after it was unveiled , the sub sank twice during sea trials , killing 13 crew members including @entity65 , who was steering - the @entity11 recovered the bodies and planned a winter attack using the vessel the @entity170 was sunk by the @entity6 in february of 1864 off the coast of @entity172 a computer generated view of what the @entity6 would look like with its explosive spar torpedo attached a schematic of the submarine from 1863 shows the rudimentary system of propulsion via levers it was carried by the sub 's captain , lieutenant @entity183 , for good luck after it stopped a bullet from entering his leg during the @entity189 in 1862			1
' the submarine was a perfect time capsule of everything inside , ' said @entity193 , one of three maritime archaeologists on the project			1
for almost 15 years the sub sat in a 90,000 - gallon tank of fresh water to leech salt out of its iron hull			2
then , last may it was finally ready to be bathed in a solution of sodium hydroxide to loosen the encrustation			0
four months later scientists , using small air - powered chisels and dental tools , began the laborious job of removing the coating			2
the @entity211 is a partnership among the @entity20 @entity213 , @entity214 , the @entity215 and the nonprofit friends of the @entity6			1
the nonprofit group raised and spent $ 22 million on the project through 2010 , said a spokeswoman			0
scientists have found the vessel to be a more sophisticated feat of engineering than historians had thought , said @entity225 , director of @entity214 's @entity226			2
' it has the ballast tanks fore and aft , the dive planes were counterbalanced , the propeller was shrouded , ' @entity225 said			0
' it 's just got all of the elements that the modern submarines have , updated			0
' there were previous submarines , @entity225 said , but the @entity6 , designed to sail in the open ocean and built for warfare , was cutting - edge technology at the time			1
' @entity183 's mission was to attack and sink an enemy ship and he did , ' @entity225 said			1
' at that particular time , the mindset of naval warfare was , basically , big ships sink little ships			0
' little ships do not sink big ships			0
and the @entity6 turned that upside down			2

@entity6 was the first submarine ever to sink an enemy warship in combat - in 1864
however , it disappeared the same night with all eight @entity5 sailors inside
its remains were discovered in 1995 in waters off @entity20 and five later it was raised to a conservation lab
now with about 70per cent of the hull cleaned of heavy rust , scientists say they are on the brink of solving the @entity47 's mysterious sinking
