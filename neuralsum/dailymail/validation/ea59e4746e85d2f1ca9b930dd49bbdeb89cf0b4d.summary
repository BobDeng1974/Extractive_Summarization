scarlets boosted their @entity2 qualification ambitions by seeing at @entity3			1
the home side remain outside of the top six , but are now just three points behind @entity6 in the battle to book a place among @entity10 's elite			1
it was a deserved win for the @entity13 - based region , who put a big dent in @entity17 's play - off hopes with just five rounds of action remaining			1
both sides welcomed back @entity22 squad members with @entity23 prop @entity24 making his first @entity17 start since september , while @entity27 centre @entity25 had not pulled on a @entity0 jersey for six weeks			2
and the @entity0 ' vice-captain came to the fore in a bright start from the home side , which was rewarded with a penalty from fly - half @entity34 after 10 minutes			0
however , @entity17 began to grow into the game as the half wore on and on 18 minutes they showed the clinical edge of champions to claim the game 's opening try			1
after @entity17 had set up an attack in the home 22 , former @entity43 star @entity42 cut an exquisite angle through the @entity0 midfield before stepping his way to score at the posts			2
fly - half @entity50 landed the simple conversion			0
the @entity54 - bound number 10 added another three points following more pressure from the visitors , but @entity0 responded strongly and crossed for their first try just before the half - hour mark			0
some slick handling by the home backs had @entity17 on the back foot and @entity65 back - rower @entity63 did well to squeeze in at the corner - although it needed the television match official to confirm the number eight had avoided touch in the process of touching down			1
@entity34 was short with the conversion and it meant @entity17 held a slender 10 - 8 advantage at the interval			1
however , a well - worked team try from the @entity0 wiped out that advantage 11 minutes after the restart			0
after strong work from the forwards which took play to the @entity17 line , the home side appeared to have butchered an overlap			1
however , they regrouped well and silky hands from @entity88 centre @entity86 put full - back @entity89 over			0
a long - range @entity50 penalty reduced the arrears to two points , then it needed a try - saving tackle from @entity63 to deny opposite number @entity95 , with @entity97 claiming a crucial turnover			0
the outstanding @entity63 was then involved at the opposite end of the field , bursting through to set up the @entity0 third try , finished off with an outstretched hand by replacement @entity103			0
@entity34 could n't land the conversion and seven points separated the sides going into the final 13 minutes			0
replacement @entity108 landed a penalty to put more distance between the sides and @entity17 left empty handed after a score by full - back @entity113 was ruled out by the @entity115 in the final minutes .			2
