the picture apparently showing a big cat dubbed the @entity2 of @entity3 was last night claimed to be a fake			1
although it certainly appears to be a black and furry four - legged beast , doubt has been cast over whether it really was photographed prowling near a certain @entity8 town			1
it emerged the photograph - possibly of a cougar - may have in fact been taken in @entity13 , @entity14 , in the @entity15 - and first published in 2007 cat - ch me if you can : @entity18 and @entity19 spotted this large feline in @entity3 , @entity8 brush with the beast : the couple were just feet away from what they believe could be the @entity2 of @entity3 , a puma or panther spotted for years in the area @entity18 and @entity19 claim they saw the unusual animal while walking in @entity30 , in @entity3 , @entity8 last week and took the photo			1
mr @entity32 , 71 , said they observed the animal catching and then eating some prey			1
he said : ' our first impression was sheer astonishment			1
we really could not believe our eyes at what we were seeing			1
' the animal was eating what we believe it had just caught			1
' there was a lot of rabbits about so i expect it was having breakfast			1
' i was about 20ft away from it while it was eating			1
it looked up at me for a couple of seconds , then resumed eating			1
expert : @entity56 investigator @entity55 said it looked like a cross between a black leopard and a puma ' if it was n't for my wife tugging at my arm to get me out of there , i would have stayed observing this magnificent animal			1
' the @entity66 are not the first to spot the creature which has been dubbed the ' @entity2 ' by locals and there have been numerous sightings over the years			1
described as a puma or panther , the animal has also been seen in nearby @entity74 and @entity75			1
after looking at the pictures , big cat tracking expert @entity55 said the animal looks like a cross between a black leopard and a puma			1
he said : ' it is what we would call a @entity85			1
' looking at the curve of the tail it is very feline			1
cats lay down to eat like that , unlike dogs or foxes which usually stand up			1
' it is difficult to judge the size as there is very little in the photo to suggest proportions , but the couple who saw it certainly say they were shocked and presumably they would have known if it was just the size of a domestic cat			1
' mr @entity55 , of @entity104 , added that it is entirely possible for big cats to survive in the @entity107			1
' i go out into the field all the time and i know how they live			1
' big cats do not need antelopes or zebra to survive on			1
they can live off hares , rabbits , pheasants , moles , and of course there is plenty of those in our countryside			1
' in the summer when there is plenty to eat , they survive on the smaller mammals , but in winter when there is less food around they will go for the bigger prey like deer			2
' he said it is widely thought big cats came to roam the @entity107 countryside after they were released by people who bought them as pets in the 1960s and 70s			2
' they were kept by the pop stars and models and people with money when there were no rules and regulations , ' he said			2
' when the @entity150 came in in 1976 , rather than have their pets destroyed they would take them out to the @entity153 or the @entity154 or somewhere similar and just let them go			2
' they bred and cross-bred after that			2
' @entity157 of @entity3 has been likened to the colour and size of a panther ( file pic ) sightings of the ' @entity2 ' have been reported for years , but there was a sudden flurry in 2009			1
chauffer @entity165 , 34 , of @entity3 , spotted what he believed was a big cat lurking by the side of a road between @entity170 on @entity171 and @entity172			2
he told the @entity174 : ' i could see these large reflective eyes and thick black coat , it was much larger than a cat			2
' @entity179 , 39 , of @entity3 , also spotted the beast twice in the space of a week , while driving towards home			2
at the time she said : ' it ran across the road like only a cat could			2
it had its back down and its tail out flat			2
it was around five and a half foot long and the height of a dog			2
” meanwhile @entity194 , of @entity195 , claimed she had a close encounter with a big black cat six years ago in @entity75			1
she took a photograph of the four - inch paw print it left on her car			1
in another incident , songwriter @entity203 , of @entity205 , told the newspaper that he saw a large cat crossing the road in front of him			2
also in 2009 , shop worker @entity212 told how she came face to face with the big cat dubbed the ' @entity2 '			1
@entity216 , 38 , a beauty specialist , was driving on the @entity217 between @entity170 on @entity171 and @entity218 when she saw the beast in the path of her car			2
she said : ' i thought it was going to eat me			2
it had just jumped out of a hedge and stood in the path of my car staring at me			2
' it 's eyes were red because of my headlights , which i then turned off because i know that with other animals , like deer , you turn your lights off and they run away			0
' the cat ran away and headed in the direction of @entity3			0
' @entity218 , 52 , from @entity3 , also saw the beast			0
he said : ' this cat ran out of the trees across the road and it was then that i saw this creature just looking out from the trees			0
' it just lay there and stared			0
it is definitely a large cat - like creature from what i could tell			0
' @entity248 , 73 , of @entity170 on @entity171 , spotted a big cat in 2010			0
she said : ' i looked over and saw a massive black cat in some dead grass by the bank			0
i turned to tell my neighbour and it had gone by the time i looked back			0
' what struck me is that it was so very very black and was much bigger than a dog			0
' meanwhile @entity259 , 73 , and his wife @entity260 , 71 , have seen a panther - like creature in @entity3 and @entity75			0
he said : ' i 've seen it walking up the drive in the middle of the night without a care in the world			0
' the wildcat of @entity268 in january 2012 , dna tests were carried out on the carcasses of three roe deer found dead at @entity272 , near @entity273 , in a bid to establish how they were killed			0
one of the deer had its vital organs missing and had had its snout severed - the hallmarks of a panther - like kill - but the tests found no evidence of a wild cat being involved			0
testing : a dna test on the carcass of this deer did not prove the presence of a big cat , but experts said the attack had the hallmarks of a panther - like creature in february 2012 , a gigantic paw print was discovered in the hills around @entity295			0
@entity296 , 32 , photographed the print on his mobile phone near the village of @entity300 in the @entity301 , while on a shooting trip with his father and brother			0
mr @entity296 , from @entity295 , said the print was like nothing he had ever seen before - while wildlife experts said its size correlated with the paw of a big cat			0
the @entity311 said the prints are unlikely to be those of a fox - unless it was an extremely large one			0
the mark of the beast ? @entity296 snapped this print on his phone while on a trip in the @entity301 the @entity301 have been the site of several reported big cat sightings in recent years , and savaged carcasses discovered in the @entity324 added weight to claims that at least one giant beast is living there			1
also in february 2012 , grainy film footage emerged online showing what appears to be a 6ft - long beast slinking across a field just three miles from @entity333			0
teaching assistant @entity334 , who lives in the area , said she had spotted the large black animal - dubbed the ' @entity336 ' , five times before shooting the video			1
she said her first sighting came in july 2009 , when she saw the panther - like creature crossing a field near her house in @entity345 , near @entity273			0
@entity346 evidence : a large cat skull , found in the @entity349 , on the edge of @entity351 in 2005 one of the more famous big cats is the @entity353 - over 60 sightings of a large black cat have occurred in the area over the years			1
in 2005 , a skull with large fangs and thought to be the remains of a big cat were found in the @entity349 close to the moor			0
the skull was sent to the @entity363 in @entity364 for verification			0
they determined that it was a genuine skull from a young male leopard , but also found that the cat had not died in @entity107			0
in fact , the skull had been imported as part of a leopard - skin rug			0
the @entity374 conducted an official investigation into the ' beast ' and other unknown animals reported to be roaming @entity107 in 1995			0
it concluded there was no ' verifiable evidence ' of exotic felines loose in @entity107 ,			0
but it also stated that the investigation could not prove that big cats were ' not present '			0
the beast of @entity385 in july 2013 , sir @entity386 claimed the beast had been on his land and that animals had been killed at the 98 - acre @entity390			1
one of his staff managed to take a picture of the purported animal			1
@entity394 , 25 , the staff member who snapped the creature when he was putting out the rubbish at @entity390 , said : ‘ i saw something about 150 metres away and did n’t know if it was a deer , but it looked strange			0
i zoomed in and took the images			0
‘ it certainly looks like a big cat			0
i have no other explanation for it			0
’ mysterious : what appears to be a big cat in a picture taken by sir @entity386 at @entity390 , @entity408			0

@entity18 and @entity19 were left shocked after seeing the huge animal
