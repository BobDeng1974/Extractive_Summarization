just weeks after publicly claiming that former first lady @entity3 was waging a ' war on women ' by enabling her husband 's philandering ways , the aide who accused the former president of groping her in the @entity2 has penned an article for a far - right - wing blog under the headline ' @entity11 deserves better than the @entity12			1
' @entity13 was a @entity15 fundraiser volunteering in the @entity2 during @entity17 's presidency who claims the former president kissed and groped her inside a private study off of the @entity22			1
now , with a potential presidential run by @entity3 in the works , @entity13 has resurfaced to warn the @entity11 public about the ' dysfunctional ' former first family			1
@entity13 accused former president @entity17 of sexually harassing her			1
now she says @entity11 ' deserves better ' than another @entity17 presidency the basis for much of @entity13 's latest criticism of the @entity12 stems from @entity3 's handling of the attack in @entity32 , @entity33 , that led to the deaths of four @entity11 , including ambassador @entity35			1
' the last time we saw @entity3 as our secretary of state , she was testifying before a congressional committee about @entity32 , ' @entity13 writes in the column published on @entity40			1
' during that meeting on jan. 22 , 2013 , we heard her shriek , “ what difference does it make ? " ' earlier , right before one of the presidential debates , on oct. 15 , 2012 , @entity3 stated during a series of interviews that she , as secretary of state , was responsible for the security of the embassy staff			2
“ the buck stops here			0
” ' i remember being so surprised when i heard it , but i was immediately suspicious , ' @entity13 concludes			2
@entity13 qualifies her shock by claiming that ' taking responsibility for anything is rare ' for the @entity12			1
she goes on to say the former secretary of state knows more than she 's willing to reveal about the @entity32 attack			0
' if it is revealed that she played a major part in the demise of our four patriots , as we suspect she did , she might want to consider retreating from public life once and for all and , together with her husband , play the role of senior stateswoman , ' she writes			0
@entity13 concludes her commentary by simply stating that ' we deserve better ' than the @entity12			1
in february , @entity13 made claims that when she was secretary of state , @entity3 orchestrated a series of investigations designed to discredit the many women who have claimed her husband sexually assaulted them ' the point is what this woman is capable of doing to other women while she 's running a campaign , basically , on women 's issues , ' she said			1
' it just does n't make any sense			0
' ' she single - handedly orchestrated every one of the investigations of all these women			0
' @entity13 said the president groped her after she approached him for a paying job in the @entity2 instead of her volunteer position @entity13 ( @entity90 ) and @entity91 ( r ) both claim @entity17 sexually assaulted them			1
@entity91 's allegations include her insistence that the former president raped her in 1978 , but she has changed her story several times @entity13 describes a 1990s @entity98 where the president conducted numerous sexual flings and the first lady -- who may run for president herself -- enabled his lifestyle by targeting his female accusers with investigations she suspects @entity3 of covering up ' nothing short of serious sexual harassment ' in her case			1
and addressing claims by some @entity15 that @entity110 politicians are conducting a so - called ' war on women ' through their social policies , @entity13 turned the notion on its head			1
' @entity3 is the war on women , and that 's what needs to be exposed here ! ' she exclaimed			1
@entity40 first reported that @entity13 told @entity121 host @entity120 that mrs. @entity3 is ' addicted to power , and she saw early on that [ @entity17 ] could be a powerful candidate			1
he had a lot of charisma			0
and she could just ride on his coattails			0
' talking about the her allegations against @entity17 , she reiterated sunday that ' the president sexually assaulted me , ' leading her to ' the little room where he and @entity132 [ @entity133 ] used to meet			2
' ' i started to go for the door and he was right behind me , ' she recalled , ' and things went from bad to worse there			0
he acted just very inappropriately			0
i was shocked and bewildered , and i thought to myself , " what in the world is he doing ? " ' @entity13 claims @entity17 , an old friend whose @entity141 campaign organization she and her husband founded , ' was very intense			1
he 's much bigger than i am			0
' following @entity13 's news - making allegations in 1998 on the @entity146 program @entity145 , the @entity98 released a series of letters and phone messages , sent after the alleged 1993 sexual harassment , which seemed to show @entity13 had a friendly outlook toward the president , and wanted more contact – not less			2
a federal judge later ruled that president @entity17 had ' committed a criminal violation ' of the @entity156 by making her letters public			2
he was not prosecuted for it			0
and @entity159 , a one - time friend of @entity17 paramour @entity133 , testified in a grand jury proceeding that @entity13 pursued @entity17 , and not the other way around			2
but @entity13 maintains that she was a victim , and has even claimed the @entity12 had her second husband murdered on november 29 , 1993 , the same day the president allegedly forced himself on her			2
the death was ruled a suicide , but she said sunday that twenty years later government agencies refuse to let her see files detailing the investigation			0
@entity13 was a prolific @entity15 fundraiser who co-founded @entity171 to help get him elected , but she would later turn on him after what she says was a sexual assault near the @entity22 the botched @entity32 terror - attack aftermath is n't the only hurdle between @entity3 and the @entity2 : foreign powers may believe she can be deceived and fooled because her husband was a serial cheater @entity181 @entity110 sen. @entity110 , an all - but - certain presidential contender , said in january that although @entity17 's presidency was marked by ' predatory behavior , it 's not fair to blame his wife for letting it continue			1
' it ’s not @entity3 's fault , ' he told @entity190 magazine , ' but it is a factor in judging @entity17 in history ... sometimes it 's hard to separate one from the other			1
' @entity13 had no problem focusing her venom on @entity3 , though			2
it 's her likely presidential candidacy that 's bringing the former president 's sexual flings back into the news			0
' just pack your bags			0
you ’ve had your 15 minutes , ' she slapped at @entity3			0
' stop forcing us to have to look at this stuff again			0
we 're sick of it			0
' but @entity13 also had harsh words for feminist groups that seem insistent on making mrs. @entity3 the first female @entity11 president			1
' all of these women 's groups , they 're all pro-hillary , ' she said			2
' they need to ... talk to someone like me and listen here , what @entity3 has done to me and many , many , many other women			2
' ' they are so hypocritical , it 's unbelievable , ' she claimed			0
' and this is the woman that wants to be president			0

@entity13 was a @entity15 fundraiser volunteering in the @entity2 when she says @entity17 kissed her *passionately* and groped her
@entity13 has *re-emerged* to bash the @entity12 as @entity3 considers a run for the @entity2
she claims @entity3 ran an investigation and smear campaign aimed at discrediting her , and claims she did it to *countless* other women
@entity3 ' enabled his behavior , ' @entity13 charged in an interview , ' and attacked all the women who just made the mistake of *walking* in front of him '
she also claims the draft of her *memoirs* were stolen from her house and blames the @entity17 's circle of friends
@entity13 wants feminist groups to acknowledge ' what @entity3 has done to me and many , many , many other women '
