by @entity0 published : 05:23 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 12:22 est , 25 february 2014 a @entity4 newspaper has published a list of the country 's ' top 200 ' homosexuals a day after the president enacted harsh anti-gay legislation			1
the @entity10 , a @entity4 tabloid , ran the names of 200 people it claims are homosexuals , including several who have not previously come out as gay , under the headline ' exposed ! ' the list includes prominent @entity4 gay activists such as @entity19 , as well as a popular @entity4 hip - hop star and a catholic priest			1
@entity40 secretary of state @entity39 said the bill marked ' a tragic day for @entity4 and for all who care about the cause of human rights ' and warned that @entity45 could cut aid to the @entity48 nation			1
he said : ' now that this law has been enacted , we are beginning an internal review of our relationship with the @entity53 to ensure that all dimensions of our engagement , including assistance programs , uphold our anti-discrimination policies and principles and reflect our values			0
' few @entity4 identify themselves publicly as gay , and the tabloid 's publication of alleged homosexuals recalls a similar list published in 2010			1
a prominent @entity4 gay activist , @entity65 , was killed after the @entity67 newspaper - which has no affiliation with the @entity69 - called for him to be hanged			1
in 2011 the then - editor said he had ' no regrets ' over the article , as it was exposing wrongdoing			0
the news comes just a day after the country 's president signed harsh new anti-gay legislation yesterday president @entity79 called homosexuality ' disgusting ' as he signed the bill into law a @entity4 judge later condemned the outing of homosexuals in a country where gays face severe discrimination , saying it amounted to an invasion of privacy			1
today @entity92 , a well - known @entity4 lesbian activist who is among those listed in the @entity10 story , tweeted : ' the media witch hunt is back			2
' the bill originally proposed the death penalty for ' aggravated homosexuality , ' defined as repeated gay sex between consenting adults and acts involving a minor , a disabled person or where one partner is infected with @entity105			0
the law also calls for first - time offenders to be sentenced to 14 years in jail			0
in signing the bill , @entity33 said the measure is needed because the @entity111 is promoting homosexuality in @entity113 , rejecting international criticism as interference in @entity4 's internal affairs			0
@entity33 accused ' arrogant and careless @entity118 groups ' of trying to recruit @entity4 children into homosexuality			0
in 2010 a now - defunct @entity4 paper @entity67 - which has no affiliation with the @entity122 - published a similar expose @entity65 ( right ) was beaten to death after another article in the same paper ( left ) called for him to be hanged @entity4 police spokesman @entity126 said on tuesday that no homosexuals have been arrested since @entity33 signed the bill but that at least two had been taken into custody since lawmakers passed the bill last december			1
@entity19 , the gay activist , said he had counted up to six arrests and said that more than a dozen @entity4 homosexuals had fled the country since december over safety concerns			2
homosexuality has long been criminalised in @entity4 under a colonial - era law that outlawed sex acts ' against the order of nature			2
' some @entity4 lawyers and activists have said they will challenge the law in court as unconstitutional and impossible to implement			2
the @entity4 law — which came just over a month after @entity146 passed a similar measure against gays — has been condemned around the world , although it is widely popular among @entity4			0
@entity151 @entity153 @entity152 warned that the law would institutionalise discrimination and could encourage harassment and violence against gays .			0
