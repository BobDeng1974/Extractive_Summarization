@entity1 admitted stealing drugs since 2002 and *swapping* new syringes with his contaminated ones in hospitals across seven states
medical technician had been fired at least for times for allegations of drug use and theft
he admitted stealing painkillers and replacing them with blood - tainted saline syringes
in all , 46 patients were infected ; one died after being infected with his strain of hepatitis c
plea agreement means he will serve around 30 years in jail - far less than the *98* years *maximum* sentence if *convicted* at trial in each state
