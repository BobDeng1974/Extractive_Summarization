two best friends have sent each other the same @entity3 card for the past 36 years			1
@entity4 , of @entity5 , and @entity6 , of @entity7 , have kept the tradition going since 1978 , when mrs @entity4 decided to play a trick on her friend			1
instead of writing a new @entity3 card , she popped the one she had received from mrs @entity6 the year before back in the post with the joke : ' could n't afford new cards this year			1
' when mrs @entity4 sent the same card back again the following year , the festive tradition began			1
june @entity6 ( left ) and @entity4 with the @entity3 card they have been exchanging since 1978 the friends , now both 79 , met as 25 - year - olds working as @entity22 telephone operators			1
the card , which depicts a snow scene of a dog with a robin perched next to its head , is now worn and creased , but is full with good wishes from each year			2
it is now so full of messages that post-it notes cover the inside so the friends can include their latest news and continue the tradition			1
mrs @entity4 , of @entity36 , @entity5 , said : ' it was just a silly joke on a simple card			2
we like a laugh , we know each other so well			0
' it is now part of @entity3 in our families			2
all our relatives want to know who 's got the card that year and what 's been written inside			1
' we always post it , even though we do n't live too far from each other , and luckily it 's never been lost in transit			0
' we wonder if we are the only people in the country or the world to do it and also if the length of time is a record			0
' the card , which features a dog holding a gun with a robin on the barrel , is now full of post-it notes with the friends ' messages from each year written on them the messages are all dated and the pair say they hope the card never gets lost in the post each note is dated so the friends can track their progress			1
for example , their joy at the card lasting so long was clear in 1992 when @entity4 said : ' who would have believed ' 92 ? ! ' a note in 1994 was just signed : ' you 'll never guess who			0
' the women worked together in @entity83 , @entity5 , in the 1960s and , as neighbours , they would travel to work together			0
their children went to the same school and they shared holidays together			0
now they meet up regularly for lunch			0
mrs @entity6 , of @entity90 near @entity91 , @entity7 , said : ' we 've always been good friends and share the same sense of humour			0
' we 've travelled round the world together and the card is something we laugh about every year			0
' the friends , pictured in the 1990s , have been friends since they worked together in @entity83 in the 1960s			2

friends met when they worked together at telephone exchange in 1960s
in 1978 , one sent the other 's previous @entity3 card back as a joke
the other friend did the same the following year and tradition started
they now have to use post-it notes to squeeze in their messages
