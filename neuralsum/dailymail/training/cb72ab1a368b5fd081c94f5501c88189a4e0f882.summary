by @entity0 more than 400 years after its discovery by @entity3 , the largest moon in the solar system has finally been mapped			0
the first geological map of an icy outer - planet moon ever created , it reveals a ' dual landscape '			0
one part is made up of complex grooves and ridges , while a second area is highly cratered			1
this mosaic was assembled using imagery from @entity16 1 and 2 and @entity3 spacecraft			0
this mosaic ( right ) served as the base map for the geologic map of @entity21 ( left )			1
since its discovery in january 1610 , @entity21 has been the focus of repeated observation , first by @entity27 - based telescopes , and later by flyby missions and spacecraft orbiting @entity29			1
these studies depict a complex icy world whose surface is characterized by the striking contrast between its two major terrain types : the dark , very old , highly cratered regions ; and the lighter , somewhat younger ( but still ancient ) regions marked with an extensive array of grooves and ridges			1
with a diameter of 3,280 miles ( 5,262 kilometers ) , @entity21 is larger than both planet @entity43 and dwarf planet @entity45			1
it ’s also the only satellite in the solar system known to have its own magnetosphere			0
' by mapping all of @entity21 ’s surface , we can more accurately address scientific questions regarding the formation and evolution of this truly unique moon , ' said @entity55 of the @entity56 , who led the research			1
published by the @entity59 , the map technically illustrates the varied geologic character of @entity21 ’s surface and is the first complete global geologic map of an icy , outer - planet moon			2
@entity55 , @entity64 and colleagues used images from @entity69 ’s @entity68 and @entity3 missions to create the map , which is only the fourth of its kind covering a planetary satellite - the others being of @entity27 ’s moon and @entity29 ’s moons @entity75 and @entity77			0
the first map of @entity21 's surface reveals large cratered areas on the @entity80 since its discovery in january 1610 , @entity21 has been the focus of repeated observation , first by @entity27 - based telescopes , and later by flyby missions and spacecraft orbiting @entity29			1

the map details geologic features of the moon that formed and evolved over much of our solar system ’s history			0
the north polar region of @entity21 , showing the @entity3 region named after the man who discovered it these features record evidence of @entity21 ’s internal evolution , its dynamical interactions with the other @entity119 satellites , and the evolution of the small bodies that have impacted @entity21 ’s surface			2
the new chart will be a valuable tool for researchers to compare the geologic characters of other icy moons , since almost any type of feature that is found on other icy satellites has a similar feature somewhere on @entity21			2
and with a surface over half as large as all the land area on @entity27 , @entity21 offers a wide variety of locations to observe			2
' @entity21 also shows features that are ancient alongside much more recently formed features , adding historical diversity in addition to geographic diversity , ' @entity64 says			0
the south polar region of @entity21			0

@entity142 reveals the ' twin terrain ' of @entity21
areas are either complex grooves and ridges , or highly cratered
