@entity4 , 44 , from @entity13 , was at home with her son watching television when she was bitten			1
she said : ' i felt something bite me and it became really itchy , but at first i thought it was just psychological			1
' but by tuesday morning it had swollen , become really red and felt hot and very uncomfortable			0
i could n’t even sit down ' ms @entity4 was given antibiotics by her gp but they made no difference and the following day the bite turned jet black			1
' by this point i was terrified , so i went to the minor injuries unit at @entity28 ' , she said			0
' they advised that i stay and have it checked out but i was due to fly to @entity31 the next day and as i have health insurance there , i decided to take the trip as planned			1
' while in @entity31 , ms @entity4 's bite worsened and she began to suffer necrosis , which can lead to gangrene			1
she said : ' by sunday , the bite had become really nasty			2
' there was a gaping hole underneath and it was oozing quite badly			0
' a @entity31 doctor informed me that the antibiotics i had been given in the @entity44 were useless and wanted me to have an operation there to have the wound drained and cleaned			1
' i could n’t , as i needed to fly home days later , so i had to make do with a much stronger form of antibiotics and some heavy duty painkillers			2
' @entity4 's false widow spider bite which turned black before it was finally cured with very strong anti-biotics fashion statement : onesies have become increasingly popular in recent years luckily , the medicine seems to have worked and ms @entity4 is now on the way to recovery			1
she wants her story to serve as a warning to others			0
she said : ' i do n’t want to scare people but i want them to be mindful that poisonous spiders do exist in this country			0
' as far as i am aware , the media has only reported incidents in the south of @entity69 up to now			0
' i believe there has been a false widow spider in my home at least once before , as i remember seeing a spider in the summer with a peculiar pattern on its back			2
' the false widow spider , or @entity77 , has been cited as @entity44 ’s most venomous arachnid			1
it has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream coloured markings that are often said to look like a skull			0
false widow spiders are distinctive with their shiny , black flesh , bulbous bodies , thick legs and skull - like patterns			1
millions of false widows , pictured right , @entity44 's most poisonous spider , are found across the @entity44 and the population is growing			1
also known as @entity77 , it is frequently confused with the black widow , which has deadly venom			2
the false widow was first spotted in the @entity44 in @entity98 , @entity99 , in 1879			1
it is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from @entity104 or the @entity105 in a shipment of bananas			0
the species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull			0
they have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size			0
the @entity115 says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the @entity44 , having been found mainly in southern @entity69			1
this theory is backed by its wildlife surveys where people report sightings to @entity122 to avoid bites and what to do if you get one the key message is that you should n't disturb spiders if you can help it because they will usually only bite you if they feel threatened			2
to avoid it while asleep , remove everything from under the bed so that the only way the spiders can get up on the bed is to crawl up one of the four legs			0
do not leave clothes around in piles for long periods as spiders like to hide in them and shake shoes in case a spider has crawled in overnight			2
if you have a garage store things in plastic bags if you use them with your hands and feet and can not see inside			0
also seal cardboard boxes if you are storing things			0
if you are unfortunate enough to be bitten and have a reaction , pack the wound in ice and seek medical attention .			0
