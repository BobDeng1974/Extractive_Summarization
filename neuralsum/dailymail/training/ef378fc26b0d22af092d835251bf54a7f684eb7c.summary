designer 's kit to rival @entity2 for @entity4 and @entity5 for @entity6 @entity9 flag colours ignored as designer ditches red and green for boring blue by @entity12 published : 06:50 est , 11 may 2012 updated : 08:40 est , 11 may 2012 when @entity2 revealed her @entity15 kit designs for @entity4 , she was widely criticised for changing the colour of the @entity18 flag to predominantly blue			1
but if you thought her style did n't truly reflect the flag the team are representing , then @entity20 's designs for the @entity9 2012 squad will be even more of a disappointment			2
the fashion supremo has unveiled his 50 - piece @entity15 collection in @entity29 , and the majority of the kit fails to incorporate the nation 's flag colours of green and red			1
instead , the minimalist collection is made up of white and navy items with a small @entity15 rings and ' @entity40 ' logo			0
sea of navy : @entity9 designer @entity20 , centre , with members of @entity9 's @entity15 squad in the sports suits he has designed spot the colour : athletes at the launch in @entity29 show off little of the colours in their nation 's flag the collection includes a plain navy polo shirt , all - white and all - navy sport jackets and navy track suit bottoms			1
the trainers are also in a minimalist design in shades or white or navy with just a hint of gold in homage to the colour of medal it is hoped the athletes will bring home			0
all the items are emblazoned with @entity73 's @entity72 sports label logo			2
the designs were modelled this week by 15 of the 280 - strong @entity9 @entity15 contingent , including five - times medallist fencer @entity76 , one of @entity9 's best hopes in the summer games			2
the sport suits will be worn by the athletes at the @entity15 opening ceremony on july 27 and around the @entity15 village , but not to compete			0
although at first sight the country the athletes are representing will not be instantly recognisable by their kit , @entity20 insisted it is patriotic			2
medal hopeful : fencer @entity76 gives the kit the thumbs up and reveals the patriotic lining featuring the first line of the national anthem going for gold : diver @entity96 , left , models the shorts and a gilet while water polo player @entity100 dons a rare piece in the collection featuring the red and green from @entity9 's flag ' i am very patriotic			1
and what is more patriotic than the @entity109 ? ' he said at the launch of his designs			0
' the fact that i have been chosen ( to design these outifts ) is a recognition to the value of what i do			0
fashion represents a great @entity9 flag for the whole world and it is a beautiful idea to combine it with sports , ' he added			1
on closer inspection , there are hints of the @entity9 flag in his design with some of the polo shirts featuring a tiny flag on the cuffs and one t - shirt having green and red sleeves			1
praise : @entity133 , left , who heads @entity135 's @entity134 , said @entity40 would definitely look ' the most fashionable ' in @entity136 this summer thanks to @entity20 's designs but viewers have to look very close to see @entity20 's most patriotic touch - the first sentences of @entity9 's national anthem have been by embroidered in gold on the inside lining of the uniform jackets and on the back of polo shirts collars			2
wearing his trademark black t - shirt and black trousers with white tennis shoes at the kit launch , @entity20 , 77 , revealed how he feels to be contributing to the @entity109 in the style - stakes , along with @entity2 , who teamed up with @entity153 to design the @entity4 kit , and @entity5 , who again kits out the @entity6 squad in 2012			1
' i am very honoured to participate with these great colleagues			0
this will be the most fashionable @entity109 ever , ' @entity20 said			0
plain : from left , the @entity9 team 's polo shirt , jacket and waterproof top minimalist : the trainers come in navy or white with a hint of gold wear with pride : the kit features the @entity15 rings and @entity73 's @entity72 sports label logo on the front , left , while on the back , the team name is silhouetted by the @entity15 athletics stadium @entity2 's @entity4 designs will be worn by the squad during competition , while @entity183 chain @entity182 have designed their formal wear			1
@entity2 was criticised for not including enough red in the designs and changing the union flag to white and blue			1
but she defended her style saying ' it actually uses more red and shows more flag than any @entity4 kit since ' 84			1
' she added : for me it â€™s one of the most beautiful flags in the world and it was important for me to stay true to that iconic design but also to modernise it and present it in a contemporary way			0
ultimately , we wanted the athletes to feel like a team and be proud with the identity we created			0
' the competition : @entity2 was criticised for turning the union flag blue in her designs for @entity4 preppy : @entity5 has kitted the @entity6 team out in his trademark style meanwhile , @entity182 's formal range for @entity4 is in a plain style like @entity20 's , with dark navy suits and ties for the men and navy skirts with a cowl neck top for the women			1
they have however incorporated the union flag into the top in gold detailing			2
@entity133 , who heads @entity135 's @entity134 , said he felt @entity40 would definitely look the best in @entity136 this summer thanks to @entity20 's designs			0
' we aim to be the best of the world in sport			0
we are definitely going to be the most fashionable , ' he said .			0
