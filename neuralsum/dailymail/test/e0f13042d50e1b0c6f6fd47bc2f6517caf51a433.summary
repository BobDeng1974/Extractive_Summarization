conflicting stance : @entity1 , pictured during a speech yesterday , will today announce a ' clear , credible plan ' on immigration @entity1 will today claim @entity6 ’s attitude to immigration has ‘ changed ’ – despite still refusing to put any upper limit on the numbers allowed in			1
in an audacious move , the @entity6 leader will insist that he offers a ‘ clear , credible and concrete plan on immigration – not false promises ’			1
he will say : ‘ we will deal with people ’s concerns because we have listened , we have learned and we have changed			2
’ but , only hours before the key election speech was due to be delivered , his own shadow home secretary refused at least four times to say @entity6 would put a target on net immigration			1
under intense pressure during a home affairs debate on the @entity27 ’s @entity26 , @entity23 would say only she wanted the number to be lower than the current 300,000			1
presenter @entity29 had pointed out that , in office , @entity6 had ‘ virtually opened the door ’ to record migration			1
during @entity6 ’s 13 years in power , the foreign - born population rocketed by 3.6million			1
home secretary @entity36 , trading blows with ms @entity23 in the debate , said : ‘ the choice is clear			1
back to a @entity39 which they admitted was not fit for purpose , or the @entity42 , who have a plan to reform free movement , cut immigration , defeat extremism and keep cutting crime			2
’ the @entity49 are fighting the election on a commitment to reduce net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’			1
speaking in the @entity54 today , mr @entity1 will claim that @entity6 would implement a ten - point plan for curbing immigration during its first 100 days in office			1
it includes recruiting an additional 1,000 border staff , banning recruitment agencies from hiring only from overseas and making it illegal for employers to undercut wages by exploiting workers			0
however , the @entity49 are likely to point out that a number of the proposals are already in the process of being implemented			0
they include the introduction of full exit checks to count people in and out of the country and ‘ stopping those who have committed serious crimes coming to @entity73 ’			0
mr @entity1 is expected to say : ‘ @entity74 once promised to cut net immigration to tens of thousands – and told us to kick him out of office if he did n’t deliver			1
but , only hours before the key election speech was due to be delivered , his own shadow home secretary @entity23 ( pictured ) refused at least four times to say @entity6 would put a target on net immigration @entity85 boss @entity84 last night hailed @entity1 as @entity73 ’s next prime minister and said the country stood on the ‘ brink of change ’			1
the unite general secretary praised @entity6 for a series of ‘ radical ’ policies , including the ‘ freeze ’ on energy prices , the mansion tax and the 50p income tax rate			1
and he praised mr @entity1 for planning to repeal ‘ some of the worst anti-union ’ laws with a commission headed by @entity99 , the former @entity100 general secretary			1
addressing a rally of trade unionists in @entity104 , mr @entity84 , whose union is @entity6 ’s biggest donor , said : ‘ our nation stands on the brink of change			1
‘ in ten days the people will cast their vote			0
they will pass their judgment on the last five years of @entity42 coalition , on the @entity6 and on @entity1 – as our leader and our next prime minister			1
’ he said @entity6 offered ‘ something different ’ and told the audience : ‘ is it radical enough ? you judge for yourself			2
’ @entity6 would ‘ end bogus self - employment and put a stop to the zero - hour contracts that have become a stain on our nation , ’ mr @entity84 added			1
‘ on tax they ’re going to tackle non-doms , a 50p tax rate for those who can afford it , a mansion tax and above all tackling tax avoidance			0
’ he said @entity74 ’s pledge to ‘ finish the job ’ of deficit reduction were ‘ perhaps the scariest words in the @entity136 language ’			0
last week mr @entity84 was caught boasting that trade unions ‘ own ’ the @entity6 and its policies			2
in the @entity140 magazine he wrote : ‘ the @entity6 is our party , we built it , to serve us			2
they are now within our grasp			0
’ ‘ but net migration rose to 298,000 last year , almost exactly three times higher than he promised			1
nothing damages people ’s faith in politics more than broken promises like that – or those he is still making today			0
' i will only make promises i can keep			0
i wo n’t offer false targets or seek to exploit concerns with the politics of fear			0
instead , i am offering clear , credible and concrete ways of making a real difference			0
’ he will add : ‘ immigration is too important an issue for our country to be abandoned by the prime minister so it can be exploited by @entity167			0
’ last week , @entity74 made a passionate plea to @entity170 voters not to risk letting in a @entity6 government that will allow ‘ a return to uncontrolled immigration ’			2
writing exclusively for the @entity174 , he said he understood people ’s ‘ fears and worries ’ about immigration			2
it followed a poll showing six in ten are unhappy with the government ’s record			0
mr @entity74 wrote : ‘ do you honestly think @entity1 cares about controlling immigration ? no. ‘ he was there the last time , remember , when net immigration increased fivefold			1
’ mr @entity1 has apologised for the calamitous underestimate of the number of @entity189 who would arrive in @entity73 when the @entity192 ’s border ’s expanded eastwards in 2004			2
but he refuses to accept that unprecedented levels of @entity195 migration were a mistake			0
one ex-labour adviser notoriously said the party ’s aim was to ‘ rub the @entity201 ’s nose in diversity ’			0
@entity1 has revealed that a @entity6 government would legalise humanist weddings			2
the move could lead to a clamour for other unconventional unions , including @entity208 and @entity210 marriages , to be given the same status as traditional weddings			0
mr @entity1 told @entity213 his government would look to give the controversial ceremonies the same status as religious and civil unions			0
there was widespread support for humanist marriage across @entity221 during the passage of the @entity223 , including from @entity6			0
‘ we still support the legal recognition of humanist marriages and we ’ll review the law , ’ said mr @entity1			2
the @entity73 ’s first pagan wedding took place last month in @entity230 .			0

@entity1 will announce that he has ‘ clear , credible plan ' on immigration
but @entity23 refused to say @entity6 would put target on net migration

during @entity6 ’s 13 years in power , foreign - born population rose by 3.6m
