@entity0 thinks @entity2 's treatment of @entity3 ' stinks ' and believes the club were keen to get rid of the 34 - year - old			1
the @entity2 captain 's july move to @entity8 was confirmed on wednesday by coach @entity9 in an interview with the @entity11			1
but @entity3 revealed he would have committed his future to @entity2 had they offered to extend his terms when he retired from @entity15			1
@entity3 will become an @entity8 player in july , the @entity18 side 's coach @entity9 has confirmed @entity3 's departure from @entity2 ' stinks ' according to former @entity21 midfielder @entity0 @entity3 was pictured out in @entity2 on tuesday night to celebrate team - mate @entity23 's 30th birthday however , having been one of @entity2 's star performers as @entity27 ' side finished second in the @entity29 last season , the midfielder was only offered a new deal in november			1
@entity3 's former @entity21 team - mate @entity0 believes @entity2 always intended to move their skipper on			1
co-hosting the @entity33 , @entity0 said : ' you can only be judged on the season you 've just played and , last season , he was terrific			2
he probably felt he 'd warranted a new contract at that point			2
@entity0 ( right ) spent six years playing with @entity3 in the @entity2 midfield before joining @entity40 ' @entity2 let it get to november or december before they offered him anything			1
in fact , that offer was only triggered by @entity45 going out in the press and saying he had n't been offered a new deal yet			2
that says to me that the club , and @entity27 [ @entity51 ] , were already thinking about him moving on			0
' each manager has his own opinion and @entity27 is not going to come out and say , " that was my decision "			0
' it stinks a bit for me though that they treat a player like that			0
we saw the same thing with @entity62 and @entity63			0
clubs say , " we have offered him a new deal " but it 's always on reduced wages			0
