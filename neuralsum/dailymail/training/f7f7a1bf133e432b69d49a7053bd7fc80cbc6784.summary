now the trend is being examined in a new documentary , @entity2 by @entity3 and @entity4 for the @entity5 @entity6 and @entity7 are looking forward to the onset of winter			1
‘ in the evening you pour yourself a glass of wine and sit looking up at the stars all lovely and warm			2
what could be nicer ? ’ says @entity7			2
come again ? after all , the @entity14 live near @entity15 , @entity16 , which is not known for its year - round sunshine			2
well , earlier this year , retired property developer @entity7 , 61 , and @entity6 , 59 , splashed out £ 7,000 on a top - of - the - range six - seater hot tub for their beautifully manicured garden			1
‘ i ’ve been in it in the rain and it ’s beautiful			2
now i ’m looking forward to a nice snowfall and sitting there with a drink , looking out over the countryside , ’ says @entity7			2
and @entity7 and @entity6 are far from alone			2
for @entity2 , it seems , has gone hot tub crazy			1
as many as one in ten homeowners have one , with spas bubbling away everywhere from humble patios to the lawns of sprawling stately homes			1
now the trend is being examined in a new documentary , @entity2			1
it focuses on @entity2 ’s main outdoor retailer , the @entity56 in @entity57			1
superstore founder @entity58 says he ’s on course to sell 2,000 tubs this year , with £ 50,000 worth of sales on peak days			0
prices start at just over £ 3,000 for a basic model , rising to £ 20,000 for a 16ft ‘ swim spa ’ with its own current			0
the 57 - year - old set up the business in 2003 following several years working in the @entity68 , where hot tubs have been popular for years			1
mr @entity58 says : ‘ hot tubs were big over in the @entity71 years ago and i sensed one day they ’ll take off in the @entity72			1
if your garden is n’t big enough for a swimming pool , then a hot tub is the next best thing			1
’ the surge in popularity , he believes , is down to a change in lifestyle here			0
‘ today a lot of people want a more glamorous life and this is a relatively cost - effective way of getting one , ’ he says			0
but despite its growing popularity , the hot tub is still looked upon with a certain degree of snobbery			1
no wonder the @entity56 ’s sales director @entity90 — @entity58 ’s son - in - law — is keen to revamp their image			0
the @entity95 family in their garden hot tub at home in @entity57 , @entity16			1
mother @entity100 with daughter @entity101 , 8 , and son @entity99 , 13 he says : ‘ the biggest misconception is that hot tubs are the preserve of swingers , indulgent @entity106 footballers or flashy types who live in @entity109			1
in fact , they are bought by anyone and everyone			0
we recently sold one to a lovely couple in their 80s			0
‘ another couple in their 70s made a purchase because they go rambling in the @entity123 and enjoy a good soak after walking			0
‘ the only thing typical of each owner is that they have their own home and are over 25			0
’ @entity95 , 34 , says she could n’t live without the hot tub in her compact garden			1
the stay - at - home mum and her engineer husband @entity131 , 37 , had an eight - seater spa installed at their home in @entity57 eight years ago — much to the delight of their children @entity99 , 12 , and @entity101 , eight			1
‘ @entity131 and i are home birds , we do n’t go out			0
instead we like to spend time as a family , ’ says @entity100			0
‘ where nicer to do it than in bubbly hot water ? ‘ i recommend everyone to get one			1
these days they ’re cheaper than some fridges — and you do n’t need a huge garden			1
’ what you do need is a firm , level base to put it on — preferably wood or concrete rather than lawn , as bare feet covered in soil and grass will make the water dirty , and an outdoor power socket.management consultant @entity161 , 53 , is also a convert			0
a divorcee , she divides her time between homes in @entity164 , the @entity165 and latterly @entity166 , where she ’s bought @entity168 , a five - bedroom @entity170 mansion in @entity172 , which she uses as a holiday home and holiday let			0
‘ i loved the property as soon as i saw it and then , tucked away in a corner of the garden , i saw an eight - seater hot tub , ’ she says			1
‘ it was a bit of a surprise , but once i got over the shock , i loved it			0
’ they ’re not always stress - free , however			0
when 42 - year - old @entity185 ordered a £ 5,000 tub online earlier this year , after pressure from wife @entity24 , 41 , and their children @entity188 , 17 , @entity190 , 14 , and ten - year - old @entity191 , delivery men could n’t get it into his @entity193 garden			1
mr @entity185 , a fireman , says : ‘ i measured up and was sure we could get it down the side of our house			0
’ but he failed to account for pipes and a gas meter			0
when the tub ended up stuck halfway down a side alley , he had to hire a crane for £ 300 to winch it into place			1
it was worth it — the family have used the tub almost daily since , and he says a lot of his colleagues want one as well			1
so , could keeping up with the @entity210 have helped fuel the hot tub bonanza ? @entity23 and @entity24 make no denial of their motivation for buying one			1
they installed a £ 5,000 outdoor whirlpool at their immaculate three - bedroom semi near @entity28 , @entity29 , in 2008 after wedding fair organiser @entity24 , 42 , experienced ‘ hot tub envy ’			1
she says : ‘ we ’d stayed with one of @entity23 ’s colleagues for the weekend and they had a tub			1
we all climbed in together and cracked open the champagne			0
it was lovely , but i felt a bit jealous			0
’ the @entity229 have a racy streak : they go au naturel in their tub — thankfully , their garden is not overlooked — stripping off and climbing in most nights after dinner			1
the @entity229 go au naturel in their tub - thankfully , their garden is not overlooked - stripping off and climbing in most nights after dinner ‘ we ’ve got some nice lighting and heat lamps out there and @entity23 built a lovely @entity243 - style wooden hut around it , so it ’s very relaxing , ’ says @entity24			1
all this fun does n’t exactly come cheap			0
the most basic model at @entity56 — the @entity248 — costs £ 3,293 , though most @entity56 customers spend between £ 4,000 and £ 8,000.then there ’s the upkeep			0
tubs are much cheaper to operate these days by keeping them warm , which is more cost effective			0
this costs around a pound a day , or £ 30 a month , for an average household			0
you also have to buy chlorine and other chemicals to keep them sanitised , which can cost £ 30 a year , while new water filters every year or 18 months cost £ 25			0
a family running a tub all year round would spend £ 400			2
but @entity7 believes the cost of his tub was well worth it			2
‘ watching the grand - children splashing around is lovely , ’ he says			0
a word of warning : keeping tubs meticulously maintained is essential to avoid them harbouring harmful bacteria , according to professor @entity276 , president of the @entity277			0
the water in hot tubs is kept at between 30c and 35c , close to body temperature , and it ’s the ideal environment for @entity282 bacteria , which causes the potentially fatal lung infection @entity284 ’ disease to flourish			2
‘ bacteria grows quickly and if there are any bodily fluids in the tub , such as urine or spittle , it provides nutrients , ’ he says			2
‘ the bubbles from the tub also generate droplets which , when breathed in , can spread @entity282			2
so you need to keep them very clean			0
it ’s important to drain and refill hot tubs every few months			2
’ there are other less deadly risks , too , with inadequately sanitised hot tubs causing skin rashes and boils			2
these slightly gruesome facts are , of course , unlikely to deter the growing army of outdoor tub fans.like it or not , they are fast becoming a feature of the @entity72 garden .			1
