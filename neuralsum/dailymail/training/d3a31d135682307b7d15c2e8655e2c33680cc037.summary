children as young as 10 were part of a ‘ criminal army ’ of @entity4 immigrants which included 13 - year - old wives ‘ bought ’ for up to 170,000 pounds each , a court heard today			1
details of the sinister network emerged during the trial of 27 men and women aged between 19 and 55 in @entity12 , eastern @entity13			1
all face up to 10 years in prison after being accused of a wide range of crimes , ranging from robbery to people trafficking			2
the case began on the day that @entity13 's foreign minister @entity21 declared @entity22 and @entity23 should not be allowed into the passport - free @entity24 due to security fears			2
ultimately run by a 66 - year - old woman , the network expected boys and girls to bring in at least 4000 pounds a month through robbing people in the street or in their homes			1
accused : the house of one of the @entity4 families who have gone on trial in @entity13			1
it is located in the town of @entity40 in @entity41 it comes as @entity43 braces itself for an influx of @entity4 from @entity23 and @entity22 when @entity46 labour restrictions are eased next year			2
@entity47 , the detective who led the enquiry into the @entity13 - based ring , said all those involved were @entity4 originally from @entity41			1
‘ we are facing an extraordinary phenomenon of burglary on an industrial scale , ’ said mr @entity51 , who said the gang – made up of three clans – operated all over @entity13 , @entity54 and @entity55 , with more than 100 robberies in 2011 alone			1
male leaders ‘ bought young wives ’ for the cash equivalent of up to £ 170,000 each from other families in @entity41 , and selected them especially for their stealing skills			1
‘ the better they were at stealing , the higher the price was , ’ said mr @entity47			0
‘ @entity69 looking women also commanded higher prices because they had a better chance of passing themselves off as minors			0
‘ the burglaries were carried out daily all over @entity74 , ’ he added			0
‘ they never stopped - for the children it was like a form of military service			0
’ those running the ring were monitored via tapped phones which revealed a ‘ mafia style ’ network , with those in charge using their stolen money to buy upmarket properties in @entity40 in @entity41			0
the defendants , who can not currently be named because of legal restrictions preventing the identification of the numerous children involved , deny all the charges			0

their treatment has caused controversy in @entity13 the officer cited the case of a woman identified as @entity105 who had been bought but failed to live up to expectations by bringing in ' only ' 200,000 euros over two years			2
her family was allegedly ordered to pay back 100,000 euros but the amount was finally reduced to 55,000 to take into account the sexual abuse she had suffered			0
the children meanwhile were expected to bring in up to 5,000 euros per month each in the form of stolen goods that were then sold on through fences in @entity13 and @entity55 , helping to finance luxury lifestyles for the clan chiefs , some of whom owned upscale properties in @entity40 in @entity41			1
their leader , the 66 - year - old woman , is being tried separately			1

' @entity130 ' : defence lawyer warned of prejudice after @entity13 foreign minister @entity21 said he will ban @entity22 and @entity23 from the @entity46 's passport - free zone until they change their immigration rules ‘ i hope there will not be a judicial stigmatisation as there is currently a political stigmatisation , ’ said mr @entity125			2
speaking on @entity140 radio today , foreign minister @entity21 said @entity13 is not in favour of allowing @entity22 and @entity23 into @entity74 's passport - free @entity24 for now due to concerns about border security			2
he said : ' if there is not a change in conditions , we wo n't be in favour			0
' his comments came amid fierce debate within @entity13 's ruling coalition over the treatment of the @entity4 population			1
some 20,000 @entity4 migrants from @entity22 and @entity23 live in hundreds of squalid make - shift camps on the outskirts of @entity13 cities			1
tensions with local communities have made @entity4 migration a contentious issue ahead of municipal elections next year			2
@entity22 and @entity23 citizens currently have the right to travel with a passport throughout the @entity24 , which removes border controls among most @entity46 countries as well as non-members such as @entity169 and @entity170			0
people from the @entity4 community leave their camp after they were expelled by police last year @entity13 authorities have been clamping down on the @entity22 and @entity23 gypsy camps for years @entity21 fears lax immigration laws in those countries could mean any nationality could gain @entity13 access temporary restrictions that imposed passport checks were put in place when the two countries joined the @entity46 in 2007 , and are due to be lifted in january			1
but each @entity46 country has the right to veto the admission of a member state into the @entity190 zone and a vote is expected before the end of the year			0
