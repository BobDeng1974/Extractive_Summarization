@entity0 last night issued a desperate appeal to voters in the @entity3 by - election to vote tactically to keep out @entity5 – as a poll showed the @entity8 party with a 12 - point lead			1
in a highly unusual move , the prime minister urged @entity12 , @entity13 and even @entity15 supporters to lend their votes to the @entity18 candidate @entity17 to prevent a ‘ @entity5 boost , and all the uncertainty and instability that leads to ’			1
the poll , commissioned by the former @entity18 treasurer @entity23 , put @entity5 on 44 per cent , the @entity24 on 32 , @entity12 on 17 and the @entity13 on only 2 per cent			1
but it still suggests a comfortable win for @entity5 ’s @entity39 , the @entity41 seat ’s former @entity18 mp , despite a massive @entity24 push			2
however , the poll also produced a glimmer of good news for mr @entity0 by showing the @entity18 could re-take the seat at the general election			0
thirty - six per cent of @entity3 voters said they would probably vote @entity24 next year , compared with 35 per cent backing @entity5			2
this could curb the enthusiasm of some @entity51 , who are weighing up whether to follow mr @entity39 and @entity54 mp @entity53 by defecting to @entity5			0
defeat in @entity3 and @entity55 on thursday of next week would be a serious setback for the prime minister			0
during another visit to the seat yesterday , he made a direct appeal to @entity63 voters to lend their votes to the @entity24 to keep @entity5 out			0
the prime minister said the seat was now a ‘ two - horse race ’ between @entity5 's @entity39 ( left ) and @entity18 candidate @entity17 ( right ) mr @entity0 told the @entity68 that the seat was now a ‘ two - horse race ’			1
voters faced a ‘ very clear choice ’			0
he said : ‘ you can vote for @entity5 and be part of the national campaign and another notch for them in their development and then the great caravan will move on , or you can vote for @entity17 , who is a hard - working person , born and raised locally			0
‘ i would say to people who have previously voted @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity15 or anything , that if you want a strong local candidate and do n’t want some @entity5 boost and all the uncertainty and instability that leads to , then @entity17 is the choice			1
’ @entity5 said it was extraordinary that mr @entity0 was trying to ‘ shoehorn @entity12 voters into his survival strategy ’			2
mr @entity39 said : ‘ every time @entity0 , his ministers , and his mps come to this constituency they show us that , for them , this election is not about the people of @entity3 and @entity55 , but about their own political careers , and whether they can survive a shift to @entity5 here in @entity3 and @entity55 next thursday , and across the country next may			1

@entity0 urged people in @entity3 by - election to vote tactically
@entity12 , @entity13 and @entity15 voters to back @entity18 @entity17
@entity109 *insists* it is a two - horse race with @entity5 candidate @entity39
poll puts @entity5 on 44 ****%**** , @entity18 32 ****%**** , @entity12 17 ****%**** and @entity13 2 ****%****
