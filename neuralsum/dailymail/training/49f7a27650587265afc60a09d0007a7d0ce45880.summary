by @entity0 published : 06:00 est , 21 march 2012 updated : 06:00 est , 21 march 2012 the widest and deepest view of the sky ever made using infrared light has been produced by the @entity6 ’s @entity5 telescope			1
the image contains more than 200,000 galaxies , with tens of thousands of them previously unknown to astronomers			1
the telescope is stationed at the @entity6 ’s @entity12 in @entity13 and is the most powerful infrared survey telescope in existence			2
light fantastic : at first glance it may look unremarkable , but this image in fact contains over 200,000 galaxies , each containing billions of stars it has been trained on the same patch of sky repeatedly to slowly accumulate the very dim light of the most distant galaxies			1
in total more than 6,000 separate exposures with a total effective exposure time of 55 hours , taken through five different coloured filters , have been combined to create this picture			0
what ’s more , the area of sky that the telescope has been trained on looks unremarkable to the naked eye - but such is the power of the telescope that a treasure trove of objects has been revealed			2
all of the fainter objects in the image are not stars in the @entity46 , but very remote galaxies , each containing billions of stars – and they can only be detected using infrared technology			2
this is because the expansion of the universe shifts light from distant objects towards longer wavelengths			0
for starlight coming from the most distant galaxies that we can observe , this means that most of the light falls in the infrared part of the spectrum when it gets to @entity63			0
as a highly sensitive infrared telescope with a wide field of view , @entity5 , which began operating in 2009 , is incredibly useful for spotting distant galaxies in the early universe			1
by studying galaxies in redshifted light at successively larger distances , astronomers can trace how galaxies were built up and evolved over the history of the cosmos			0
close inspection of the picture reveals tens of thousands of previously unknown reddish objects scattered between the more numerous cream - coloured galaxies			0
these are mostly very remote galaxies seen when the universe was only a small fraction of its present age			0
previous heavenly work by the @entity5 telescope : this image of the @entity86 was captured in 2010			1

the image contains a *staggering* 200,000 galaxies , taken by the @entity91 *'s* @entity5 telescope in @entity13
