an inquest has heard the gay comedian ‘ took advantage ’ of @entity1 after introducing the fashion student to his ‘ hedonistic lifestyle ’ , involving parties fuelled by alcohol and drugs			1
but despite the serious nature of the accusations against the comedian , he was referred to simply as ‘ mr x ’ during the inquest after the coroner backed an informal agreement to protect his name			1
an mp criticised the decision last night and said the public should be concerned if there are ‘ deals being done behind closed doors preventing basic facts coming into the public domain ’			0
the inquest heard that the teenager was showered with gifts and promised a job by the celebrity , but spiralled into depression after falling out with the star , who left him feeling ‘ belittled and humiliated ’			1
