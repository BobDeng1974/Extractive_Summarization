by @entity0 exposed midriffs made a big comeback this year , with celebrities such as @entity4 and @entity5 regularly showing off their toned stomachs at awards ceremonies , music videos , nights out and regular ‘ selfies ’ on @entity10 and @entity11			0
but as a result doctors say increasing numbers of young women are seeking treatment to remove thread veins from this newly exposed area			1
experts at dr @entity19 , a network of thread vein removal clinics based across the @entity23 , have reported a 20 per cent increase in women undergoing treatment on thread veins in the ‘ subcostal margin ’ – the area between the edges of the ribs , down to the soft abdomen			1
women often have a genetic predisposition to suffering from thread veins on their midriffs , doctors say			1
patients are usually very fair skinned and redheads are even more likely to have them			0
dr @entity62 , medical director at dr @entity19 said demand for vein removal from the midriff area has soared this year			2
he said : ‘ whereas the top two most common areas women have thread veins treated are on their faces and legs , recently we have seen a sharp rise in the number of 20 - 40 year old women coming in with concerns about thread veins in the subcostal margin , and this area is now the third most common part of the body for treatment			1
’ soaring numbers of young women are seeking treatment for thread veins found on their midriffs ‘ many patients tell us they feel self - conscious wearing a bikini or crop top if they have thread veins in this area – which usually appear in a ‘ belt ’ of tiny , vertical red lines			1
’ other celebrities who are fans of the exposed midriff include @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity41 , and @entity97 , who just weeks ago posted a ‘ selfie ’ of herself in her @entity99 underwear and boasted a picture perfect midriff			0
the women seeking treatment are becoming increasingly younger than their usual clientele , dr @entity62 added			0
he said : ‘ interestingly , the patients we have treated for this area over the last 12 months have been getting younger , with the majority aged between 20 and 30 - year - old			2
’ he continued : ' we do also treat older women up to the age of 40 , but patient numbers tend to fall after this age			0
' this could be down to older women preferring not to bare their midriff , or perhaps becoming more body confident as they get older			0
