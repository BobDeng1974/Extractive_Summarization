those opposed to planned cull of badgers in @entity15 and @entity16 may also choose not to holiday there			0
@entity20 boycott : the @entity0 is predicting that shoppers will boycott milk from farms in areas where badgers are shot to stop the spread of @entity7 among cattle @entity27 , the @entity0 ’s chief executive , said : ‘ those who care will not want to visit areas or buy milk from farms soaked in badgers ’ blood			1
’ mr @entity27 said that supermarkets should label milk produced from areas outside the cull zone as being ‘ badger friendly ’ , in the same way as some cans of tuna are marked out as being ‘ dolphin friendly ’			1
@entity0 spokesman @entity42 said : ‘ what we would like to see is people being given a choice when they go into their supermarket , whether to buy milk from a badger cull area or not			1
‘ it ’s a very simple consumer choice issue , it ’s not about a boycott			0
’ however , the @entity52 has warned that labelling would not be simple and says that if the spread of bovine @entity7 is not stemmed , customers will ultimately end up paying more for their milk			2
culling row : @entity0 spokesman @entity42 , left , said that people should know whether the milk they buy is from a badger cull area but @entity52 president @entity60 , right , says it is sending ' a really dangerous message ' @entity52 president @entity60 told @entity64 ’s @entity63 that to try and bankrupt farmers and put them out of business is ‘ a really dangerous message ’			1
@entity7 , which can be spread by badgers , leads to up to 30,000 cattle being slaughtered a year , at a cost to the dairy industry of around £ 90million			1

they accuse the government of making a decision based on politics rather than science and say that studies have shown that culling badgers can actually foster the spread of the disease , rather than slow it			2
this may be because disturbing a badger population causes survivors to roam further afield , taking the disease with them			2

more extreme animal welfare groups are planning other methods of protest including sabotaging culls and vandalising supermarket cash machines			0
shadow environment secretary @entity92 said : ‘ there is widespread concern about the government ’s decision to press ahead with a badger cull despite their own official advice that it will cost more than it saves and will spread bovine tb in the short term as badgers are disturbed by the shooting			2
