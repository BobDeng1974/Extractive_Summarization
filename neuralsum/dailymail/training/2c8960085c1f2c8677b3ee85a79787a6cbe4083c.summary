@entity0 gave a nod of admiration			1
he liked this line of enquiry , which had turned the spotlight nicely onto @entity6 , @entity8 ’s sponsors and hosts for the @entity11 squad announcement			1
so @entity0 , is your @entity8 team a family saloon or a sports car ? ' very good question , ' he chortled			1
' i do n’t know if i ’m clever enough to answer			0
all i ’ll say is this … i ’ll allow you to decide if it ’s a family saloon or a sports car			0
i ’m happy to drive it			0
' nice reponse , it was agreed and the nod of admiration was duly returned			0
at the wheel : @entity0 arrives for the @entity8 @entity29 announcement at @entity30 no alarms and no surprises : @entity0 's @entity8 squad was predictable but received well holding court : the @entity8 boss delivers his announcement in a room packed with journalists life through a lens : @entity0 was well prepared and calm for his squad announcement on monday a titter of approval rippled around the cramped and airless conference room inside the @entity6 car plant in @entity46 chosen by the @entity47 for this grand revelation			1
the @entity8 boss may be of mature years but he remains of nimble mind , even if it does not always seem that way when he is on the touchline , scratching his head and dithering over which of his many substitutes to deploy			2
clearly , he had not been up all night crunching the final names on his 23 - man list or worrying that @entity59 might be reaching for the air - gun and plotting his revenge			1
in fact , @entity0 made it seem like he could have announced this squad weeks ago			1
he was merely waiting for the troublesome @entity66 season to grind to an end before he pulled on his driving gloves , turned the key and set the @entity70			0
it must be in the blood			0
the son of a @entity75 bus driver is behind the wheel			0
all aboard , ding - ding , mr @entity0 reaches up and rolls over the destination board until it reads : ' @entity78 '			1
out with the old : @entity59 has retired from international football after his exclusion from the squad and in with the new : @entity83 's exciting teenager left back @entity84 has won a seat on the plane the next time @entity6 appeared in a question , it was not quite such a complimentary context			1
are n’t @entity8 just a bit too much like @entity6 , quite reliable but ordinary ? ouch			1
no sweat for @entity0 though			2
he is a well - read man of words , in his element when the nation hangs on his every word			2
after threatening to summon the man from @entity6 to defend his honour , the @entity8 boss rolled into a statistical defence on his two years at the helm			1
' we do n’t lose often , ' he said			0
' i ’ve had three defeats in 25 games , all in friendly matches , when i ’ve made a lot of experiments			0
' @entity0 was in his groove by this point			2
his 23 names had not caused a stir			0
after his decision to omit 107 - cap @entity59 in favour of one - cap teenager @entity84 had leaked out the night before , the heat was off			1
he arrived late – not a great advert for @entity6 or the massive watch on his left wrist for that matter			2
the past was yours but the future 's mine : @entity124 is on stand - by but @entity125 is in the squad confirmation of the 23 - man squad and the seven on stand - by released online by the @entity47 had beaten him into the room by a good 15 minutes and it was to be as had been expected			1
' it ’s a big day , ' said @entity0 when he got around to it			2
he is an @entity135 who is genuinely proud to be driving this particular bus , or family saloon , or …			0
he has taken the @entity138 to football ’s biggest tournament and here he is about to lead @entity8 to @entity141			1
after the cold calculation of @entity144 and @entity145 , it is reassuring to know there is a little national pride behind this @entity11 caper			0
@entity8 are going to the @entity11 with plans to win it , he explained , but if they come home with nothing more than added experience then so be it			1
they would be all the better for @entity155 in @entity156			0
@entity0 ’s team is evolving fast , and it enjoys a spirit of adventure with 11 from @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity83 – three teams who have been committed to fast and exciting football in the last nine months			0
simply by selecting @entity84 ahead of @entity59 , @entity125 ahead of @entity124 and @entity166 at the expense of @entity168 , this squad feels a little more fresh and exciting			1
at this stage , only six of those who started against @entity171 in the @entity173 quarter - finals in @entity174 are on the plane			0
only seven of the 17 who appeared in @entity0 ’s first game , a friendly in @entity181 nearly two years ago , are on the plane			0
or lining up for a go in @entity0 ’s sports car .			2

@entity0 has announced his 23 - man @entity8 squad for the @entity11
no surprises in squad as @entity59 makes way for @entity84 and @entity124 is placed on stand - by
announcement was made at @entity6 car plant in @entity46
@entity8 face their first @entity11 match in @entity141 on june 14
