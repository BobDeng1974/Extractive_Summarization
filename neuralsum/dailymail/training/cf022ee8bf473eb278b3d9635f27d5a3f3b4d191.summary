by @entity0 @entity1 : 10:45 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 11:54 est , 20 december 2013 writing a letter to @entity4 is an annual tradition dating back generations			0
making a wish list and sending off an envelope to the @entity9 marks the beginning of the build up to @entity4 for children all over the world			2
and now , @entity15 photographer @entity14 has been granted special access to the letters to @entity18 collected by the @entity15 postal service , which make for heartwarming reading			1
some of the letters are wonderfully humble , such as this one asking for ' two string puppets ' , ' @entity24 friends ' and a ' surprise board game ' for the family this rather polite boy sweetly inquires into @entity18 's health , and the well - being of ' ms clause ' before asking for his gifts a truly heartwarming letter by an older sister , asking for a ' standy up table ' for her baby sister the spelling mistakes and scrawled handwriting make this child 's request for a @entity40 terrier even sweeter this very honest and penitent child has used his letter to @entity18 to confess that he does n't listen enough to his parents mr @entity14 , who lives in @entity44 , was given access to the @entity46 ( @entity47 ) by the @entity15 postal service @entity49 , which sorts all the @entity4 letters addressed to @entity18 - and sends them on to the @entity9 , naturally			1
sometimes the requests are modest ; at other times , heartbreaking			0
and sometimes they 're just downright hilarious			0
one child heartbreakingly asks @entity4 for a jewellery box for her mum because the robbers took hers and one cheeky chap asks what age mrs @entity59 is			0
other highlights include a little girl writing a present list for her baby sister 's first @entity4 ; and another asking @entity18 to take daddy down the chimney with him			2
' i 've been very good this year , i 've even tidied my room ! ' @entity69 , aged 7 , asks for some rather specific gifts , and for @entity18 to say hi to @entity59 and the reindeer @entity15 photographer @entity14 was granted special access to @entity18 's @entity4 letters ' if i was good enuf ' : says thoughtful @entity75 , who hopes that @entity18 's elves are n't working too hard this cheeky child declares ' mummy 's too lazy to write a letter ' and requests @entity18 ' take daddy down the chimney ' with him the care taken to write and often illustrate the letters show just how much these letters mean to the children showing the tech - savvy nature of children today , many letters contain requests for items such as phones and video games while some children have simple requests , others have 27 specific present requests mr @entity14 who lives in @entity44 was given access to the @entity46 ( @entity47 ) by @entity49 where the letters are sent on to the @entity9 many children ask for a ' surprise ' in their letters , suggesting that the next generation are not entirely materialistic and still enjoy the magic of @entity4			1
