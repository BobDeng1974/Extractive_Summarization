scientists at the @entity1 in @entity2 , @entity3 say they have discovered two new subatomic particles by smashing protons together			1
the two new particles , called @entity7 ' - and @entity8 * , were previously predicted to exist but had never been seen before			1
it 's hoped the discovery could shed more light on how the universe works beyond the currently accepted models of physics			1
the @entity1 in @entity3 has discovered two new particles			1
the discovery was made by smashing protons at 99.9999 % the speed of light ( illustration shown )			1
the two new particles are called @entity8 ' - and @entity8 * and are each six times more massive than a proton the new particles were created by firing protons around the 17 - mile ( 27km ) tube of the @entity1 , specifically the @entity1 beauty ( lhcb ) experiment			1
they were then smashed together at 99.9999 per cent the speed of light , replicating the conditions at the @entity27 as the protons collide , huge energies are released and previously unseen particles can be created and detected for a fraction of a second			1
discovering new particles is n't that rare at @entity2 - dr @entity35 from the @entity36 ’ @entity33 told the @entity37 that three to five are discovered every year			1
quarks are elementary particles , the smallest particles we know to exist			2
when they combine they form compound particles known as hadrons that are grouped in two families - baryons and mesons			2
quarks are said to have six ‘ flavours ’ : up , down , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 ( also known as beauty )			0
combinations of quarks within these flavours gives rise to the ‘ larger ’ particles			2
groups of three quarks are known as baryons			0
an example of a baryon is a proton , which is made of two ' up ' quarks and a ' @entity68 ' quark			2
but , he added : ' here we have two in one go , which is quite extraordinary			0
' the new particles discovered are known as baryons , and are made up of smaller subatomic particles called quarks			1
quarks are among the smallest particles known to exist that make up all other particles , known as elementary particles			0
there are six different types of quark , and combining them together in different combinations produces larger particles			0
baryons include some of the more massive subatomic particles , such as protons and neutrons , that make up most of the visible matter in the universe			1
but while particles like protons and neutrons are ever - present in the modern universe , other particles decay rapidly and are harder to spot			1
that is what scientists at @entity2 have been investigating - namely , over the past few years they have smashed particles together at close to light speed to simulate the conditions of the @entity27			1
by creating a replica cosmic ' primordial soup ' they are able to create some of the particles that were present at the @entity27 but do not exist today			1
a loose analogy would be smashing an apple and a pear together at the speed of light , and seeing a strawberry flash into existence for a tiny fraction of a second			1
this graph shows the results from the @entity116 that confirmed the existence of the particles			0
@entity7 ' - is the first peak and @entity8 * - is the second peak			1
the black points are the signal sample and the hatched red histogram is a control sample			0
the blue curve represents a model including the two new particles , fitted to the data the new particles were created by firing protons around the 17 - mile ( 27km ) tube of the @entity1 , specifically the @entity1 beauty ( lhcb ) experiment , pictured atoms are usually made of protons , neutrons and electrons these are made of even smaller elementary particles			1
elementary particles , also known as fundamental particles , are the smallest particles we know to exist			0
they are subdivided into two groups , the first being fermions , which are said to be the particles that make up matter			0
the second are bosons , the force particles that hold the others together			0
within the group of fermions are subatomic particles known as quarks			2
when quarks combine in threes , they form compound particles known as baryons			0
protons are probably the best - known baryons			2
sometimes , quarks interact with corresponding anti-particles ( such as anti-quarks ) , which have the same mass but opposite charges			0
when this happens , they form mesons			0
mesons often turn up in the decay of heavy man - made particles , such as those in particle accelerators , nuclear reactors and cosmic rays			1
mesons , baryons , and other kinds of particles that take part in interactions like these are called hadrons			2
in this latest research the new @entity184 particles are made of one ' strange ' , one ' down ' and one ' bottom ' ( or beauty ) quark			2
they were created by smashing together protons , but were found time be six times as massive as a proton			1
each of the two new particles also had it 's own ' spin ' , which basically explains how they interact with magnetic fields			0
it was found that the spin of the lighter strange and down quarks in the xi_b * - particle were aligned , while in the @entity203 ' - particle they pointed in opposite directions - making the former slightly heavier			2
scientists hailed the discovery of the two particles as an important moment for physics that would help them further understand the universe at a subatomic level			1
' nature was kind and gave us two particles for the price of one , ' said dr @entity217 of the @entity220 's @entity219 laboratory at @entity221			0
' the @entity7 ' - is very close in mass to the sum of its decay products : if it had been just a little lighter , we would n't have seen it at all using the decay signature that we were looking for			0
' dr @entity226 from @entity227 in @entity228 added : ' this is a very exciting result			0
thanks to @entity116 's excellent hadron identification , which is unique among the @entity1 experiments , we were able to separate a very clean and strong signal from the background			2
' it demonstrates once again the sensitivity and how precise the @entity116 detector is			0
' subatomic particles can be largely classified in two groups ( shown in graphic ) : fermions , which include quarks and leptons , are those that make up matter , while bosons are said to be the ' force ' particles finding new particles improves our knowledge of subatomic physics ( illustrated is an atom with eletrons ) , and it also reveals how the universe works beyond our models			1
the finding of two particles in one experiment was also described as being ' extraordinary ' in addition to finding out the mass of the particles , the scientists also discovered how unstable the particles were			1
the results match up with predictions based on the theory of @entity269 ( @entity269 )			0
@entity269 is part of the @entity271 of particle physics , the theory that describes the fundamental particles of matter , how they interact and the forces between them			2
testing qcd at high precision is key to refining our understanding of quark dynamics , models of which are tremendously difficult to calculate			0
' if we want to find new physics beyond the @entity271 , we need first to have a sharp picture , ' said dr @entity35			0
' such high precision studies will help us to differentiate between @entity271 effects and anything new or unexpected in the future			0
' the latest measurements were made with data taken at the @entity1 during 2011 - 2012			1
the @entity1 is currently being prepared - after its first long shutdown - to operate at higher energies and with more intense beams			2
it is scheduled to restart by spring 2015 .			0

the @entity1 in @entity3 has discovered two new particles
discovery was made by smashing protons at 99.9999 % the speed of light
this replicates the conditions of the @entity27 and creates new particles that do not naturally occur on @entity307 today
the two new particles are called @entity8 ' - and @entity8 * and are each six times more massive than a proton
finding new particles improves our knowledge of subatomic physics
and it also reveals how the universe works beyond our models
