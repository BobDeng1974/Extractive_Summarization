with superfans already eagerly camped out at @entity2 ahead of @entity4 's due date , it seems that the birth of @entity6 in 2013 did nothing to diminish the undeniable global fascination surrounding royal babies			0
and it 's not just brits that are starting to make excited estimations , the frenzy has reached @entity14 where there are more than a few guesses about royal baby particulars			1
international research firm , @entity19 , has conducted a poll asking the @entity21 and the @entity14 their opinions on the second child , and it turns out , views are not too different			2
in fact , this landslide opinion was only contested by two per cent of @entity33 and seven per cent of @entity14 , who alternatively want @entity6 to have a baby brother			0
when it comes down to a name for @entity25 and @entity4 's potential little girl , the survey revealed discrepancies between what @entity33 and @entity14 want			2
in the @entity21 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 are the leading names , with @entity47 scooping the lead with 13 per cent			1
@entity14 instead favour distinctively prominent royal names , with the top three being @entity54 at 19 per cent , and @entity55 and @entity56 tying at 12 per cent in terms of popularity			1
the 2013 birth of @entity6 did nothing to diminish the undeniable global fascination surrounding royal babies , with many having placed bets on the sex and name of the second child princess @entity54 was the much - celebrated first wife of @entity67 , and also the mother of prince @entity25 , before passing away in 1997			0
the popularity of the name @entity55 is most likely derived from the name of the current queen , @entity55 similarly , the popularity of the name @entity56 , is from @entity55 @entity56 , whose reign of nearly 64 years is the longest of any other @entity21 monarch			0
when it comes down the names for a potential baby boy , the survey revealed much more unified results			0
both brits and @entity14 agree on @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 as their favourite top three boy names , with @entity82 scooping the lead , at 27 per cent in the @entity21 and 15 per cent in the @entity14 , in terms of popularity			1
@entity14 have picked @entity54 and @entity55 as their favourite names if the royal baby is in fact a girl			1
the popularity of these names could have stemmed from prominent names of other royals , including the @entity54 ( pictured left ) and @entity55 ( pictured right ) and it 's not only immediate particulars about the unborn baby 's life being discussed ; people were also keen to throw in their two cents about the most suitable roles for the child 's later life			1
both were in agreement that in the future , baby number two should focus on acting as a good role model for young people			1
opinions divided when it came to the second most important @entity33 believe the second child of @entity25 and @entity4 should also prioritise having a job , @entity14 feel that the next priority should be raising money for charity			0
although @entity14 are showing some interest in the new royal baby , the majority of the @entity14 are far less interested in the latest arrival , in comparison to @entity6 's birth in 2013			2
a poll by @entity19 revealed that both @entity33 and @entity14 want royal baby number two to be a girl ( picture posed by model ) according to a new survey by the @entity130 , @entity14 are five times less interested in the new royal baby than they were with @entity133			1
@entity134 , professor of marketing at @entity130 , told the @entity135 : ' they were three times more interested in the birth of @entity138 and @entity140 's baby and equally excited by the [ forthcoming ] birth of @entity142 and @entity144 's child			0
' only one in 10 @entity14 describe themselves as excited about the second royal baby			2
some of this is inevitable but it also represents a wider attitudinal shift across the @entity14			0
' @entity14 still love @entity149 ... but the royals are now part of that , not the face of it			0

a new poll has asked brits and @entity14 questions about the royal baby
both nationalities favour a girl and want her to be a good role model
@entity21 's top names are @entity47 and @entity48 , while @entity14 likes @entity54 and @entity55
