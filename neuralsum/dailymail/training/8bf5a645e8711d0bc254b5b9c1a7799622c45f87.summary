@entity0 is facing a growing backlash over its ‘ @entity3 ’ eyewear , with cafe owners in the @entity5 banning the technology from their premises			1
@entity8 , who runs the @entity9 in @entity10 , said those wearing the spectacles will have to remove them if they want to come in			0
he has put up a sign on the wall which reads : ‘ respect our customers ’ privacy as we ’d expect them to respect yours			0
’ invasion of privacy ? : @entity3 can film what the wearer sees without any indication to others the move comes after it emerged people wearing @entity3 could be banned from @entity5 cinemas , casinos and even parks because owners do n’t want filming there			1
the glasses , which cost $ 1,500 a pair ( £ 980 ) , are currently on limited release to 2,000 customers but will be more widely available later this year			0
should @entity0 glasses be banned in cafes to protect customers ' privacy ? a camera next to the wearer ’s eye , which can take photos or record video without a red light or a shutter sound to tell others that it is working , has caused concerns for privacy			2
@entity51 said the futuristic eyewear could help cheaters to win unfairly and cinemas said they could be used to illegally record films and sell pirate copies			2
lap dance clubs said that they would treat those wearing the @entity60 - connected specs the same as anyone caught filming a stripper with a cameraphone - and would kick them out			2
behind the lens : wearers of @entity3 can film as they walk around wearing the technology parks departments and banks across @entity5 are also waiting to see how the new technology is used before deciding whether or not to ban them			1
@entity74 , of legal firm @entity73 , which is co-ordinating a privacy lawsuit against @entity0 in the @entity78 , said : ‘ this is the ultimate snooper ’s gizmo			0
if you walk around with a video camera filming , it ’s obvious what you ’re doing , but with @entity3 , it ’s much , much more invasive			1
’ @entity0 ’s chairman @entity86 once admitted that the aim with such technology was to ‘ go right up to the creepy line and not cross it ’			0
but the public clearly feels differently and in @entity92 those wearing @entity3 style specs have been subjected to ‘ cyber discrimination ’			1
@entity97 computer engineering professor @entity96 was at a @entity99 ’s restaurant in @entity100 when he claims an employee tried to physically remove a similar gadget he designed from his head .			0
