by @entity0 published : 07:48 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 09:16 est , 21 june 2013 this is definitely a case of workmanship falling short of the mark required - about 12 inches short to be precise			1
road workers have baffled residents after only repainting half a cycle lane marking - leaving it looking like ' someone has painted two @entity10 on the road '			1
instead of neatly repainting the whole sign after a section of a busy @entity16 road was dug up for a cable to be replaced , workers messily painted just a set of wheels to denote a cycle lane			1
woeful : road workers have been ridiculed for this shoddy attempt to repaint a cycle lane in @entity16 it has left @entity29 and @entity30 , who asked the contractor to carry out the work , red - faced after passers - by ridiculed the woeful work which even the artist admitted was shoddy			1
@entity34 , who lives opposite the cycle lane , said : ' it looks like someone has just come along and painted two @entity10 onto the road			1
' neighbour @entity38 who is the former manager of @entity39 ( @entity40 ) , said : ' i would have thought someone would have been along to inspect it			2
' i smiled when i saw it			2
i just thought , " typical "			1
' pet shop owner @entity45 said : ' i did n’t know whether to laugh or cry			2
i ’m really surprised they only painted half the cycle sign			2
' i know paint is expensive these days , but it does n’t make any sense to paint half a sign			2
' i was cycling to work in @entity16 when i spotted it			1
i could n’t believe it			2
' dog walker @entity53 also saw the funny side , but thought it did not portray @entity56 in the best light			2
@entity53 said : ' if you ’re going to do a job , you should do it properly			0
' a little further down the same road , more example of dubious paintwork was spotted			1
this time , only the letters ‘ o ’ and ‘ w ’ - to make the word ‘ slow ’ - had been painted on a patch of road that had recently been resurfaced			1
ridiculous : one passerby said it looked as if ' someone has just come along and painted two @entity10 onto the road ' @entity76 , external communications manager at @entity77 firm @entity29 , said : ' unfortunately , our artistic skills do not seem to have met our usual high standards in this instance			1
' these markings were put down as a temporary measure by our reinstatement team and have now been rectified			0
we are sorry for any confusion caused			0
' @entity29 is working in the area , on behalf of @entity30 , to replace and upgrade a major electricity cable			0
a spokesman for @entity90 said : ' following the completion of these major works by contractors working on behalf of @entity30 , the council has become aware of a number of shortcomings in the quality of the work done , including the road markings in several locations			1
' the council will be meeting with the contractors on site next week to discuss its concerns , and will be seeking a satisfactory solution to the problems , to be funded by @entity30			0
' this appears to be just the latest case of blundering workmanship becoming the butt of jokes and ridicule			0
last month , council workers painted two sets of double yellow lines down a cycle path which is too narrow for a car to squeeze down			0
tight squeeze : the cycle lane with double yellow lines in @entity120 is just 136cm wide and is too narrow for cars to get down cycle lane : the path can not fit a car down it - but the council insist the lines are needed to protect cyclists in @entity120 motorists in @entity120 were baffled when the lines appeared down both sides of the 136cm wide lane which motorists could n't park in even if they wanted to			0
the average width of a five - door hatchback such as a @entity136 is 174cm , so would be unable to get down the path			0
however the council insist the lines are necessary to protect cyclists			0
workmen in @entity142 were also subject to ridicule after painting a cycle lane down the centre of a busy road - because cars were parked down the edge			1
dopey workmen painted the large white bicycle symbols next to the central reservation line in @entity152 in @entity153 , @entity154 the large white bicycle symbols are next to the central reservation line in @entity152 in @entity153 , @entity154			0
and instead of keeping to the side where they would be much safer , the new cycle path now encourages cyclists to dangerously go down the @entity160			0
cyclist @entity161 , 46 , who lives on the street , said he ca n't understand why @entity163 would want cyclists to be in the @entity160 .			0

contractor admits the work on the road in @entity16 was below standard
locals ridiculed the work saying it was ' typical ' and ' amateurish '
