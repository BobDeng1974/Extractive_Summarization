disgraced teacher @entity0 , the woman convicted of having sex with a 14 - year - old student is officially back on probation amid protests from the victim 's family			1
the 32 - year - old was dealt a ten - year suspended sentence in 2005 for a string of sexual encounters with a pupil at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14			1
but the punishment was frozen by a retiring judge to allow her to help care for her newborn twin sons as well as her cancer - stricken mother in 2011			1
on thursday , however , she was put back under @entity22 supervision to see out the remaining four years and two months of her sentence			2
' @entity30 's striking looks made her a household name in 2005 after she was convicted of two counts of lewd and lascivious battery , barely more than a year after she married			1
the story took a bizarre twist after @entity53 , the lead detective in her case , was arrested before the trial in an unrelated prostitution sting , while @entity59 police officers were probed when it was revealed they took graphic nude photos of @entity30 while she was in stirrups in a jail cell			1
attention grabbing : @entity67 's crimes drew national attention after provocative images taken of her before teaching , like this one , were released in 2009 , once she completed sex offender therapy , a judge allowed her to have contact with her relative 's children , though she was still banned from living within 1,000 feet of where children congregate			2
@entity0 later went on national television to explain her actions , attributing her indiscretions to bipolar disorder , hyper - sexuality and poor judgement during manic episodes			2
her ex husband , @entity0 , left her and also appeared on a number of chat shows , before she remarried and gave birth to twins			0
in 2011 a retiring judge offered leniency to @entity30 - who is now using her maiden name @entity93 - but in a move an appellate court later ruled to have been an ‘ abuse of judicial power			1
’ but before the judge made that ruling , a sister of @entity102 's victim - who is now 23 - said her brother 's mental health has been devastated			2
her voice shaking , the sister was allowed to testify after giving only her initials			0
' this is something that has consumed his life , ' she said , adding that her brother remained under psychiatric care and was himself opposed to an early end to her probation			1
circuit judge @entity118 reinstated @entity30 's probation on thursday to finish the remainder of her sentence of four years and two months			1
rules apply : @entity0 , pictured beside her attorney and mother in blue , must stay away from schools and has a curfew set from 10pm to 6am staying close : @entity0 said she was thankful for her time off her probation with it allowing her to spend more time with her mother , pictured , who was diagnosed with cancer for the second time she also reinstated her curfew from 10pm to 6am and said the former teacher must stay away from schools as well as her former victim she met while teaching at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14			1
she was charged with two counts of felonies after pleading guilty to having sexual intercourse and oral sex on four different occasions with the boy - one of which was at the school			1
@entity0 was reported by the boy 's mother in may of 2004 and was immediately arrested			2
the disgraced teacher avoided jail entirely , despite facing up to 30 years behind bars if convicted			0
she was then sentenced to only seven years probation and three years house arrest			0
@entity0 's attorney on thursday said they do n't plan to give up after appealing to the state 's highest court			0
‘ it 's been eight and a half years now and the case is still not over , ’ @entity156 told the @entity157			0
' we 're hopeful that we will receive a favorable ruling within the next six months to a year from the supreme court and then that should finally conclude things			0
’ exiting the courthouse @entity0 ’s mother gave a thumbs up to reporters ’ cameras while trailing behind her daughter			0
