by @entity0 @entity1 believes there 's no chance his @entity5 players will melt in the white - hot heat of the @entity7 against the might of @entity9			1
the national manager has named a 26 - man squad to face the recently - crowned world champions on sunday week at the 80,000 capacity home of @entity15			1
@entity1 called up uncapped midfielder duo @entity16 and @entity17 to offset the absence of injured trio @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
bullish : @entity1 has talked up his side 's chances ahead of taking on world champions @entity9 young gun : @entity26 's @entity16 has represented @entity5 youth sides and is now in the senior squad he 's back : goalkeeper @entity29 has been recalled , and will be pushing for the no 1 jersey @entity26 's @entity29 returns to the international fold to put pressure on @entity33 and @entity34 for the no 1 jersey while @entity37 midfielder @entity36 misses out			1
but irrespective of what side he selects to face @entity40 's team , @entity1 believes his players have the wherewithal to withstand the demands of what is currently the most daunting fixture in international football			1
' you find out your true character when you walk out on to the pitch but i do n't have a problem with these guys ' characters , ' he said			2
the big match : @entity1 has no fear going into the @entity9 vs @entity5 clash at the @entity7 golden goal : @entity58 volleys home against @entity60 to win the @entity61 for @entity9 ' i have no worries about them at all , not one bit			1
' i have no concerns about anyone 's going to freeze or think it 's too much for them			0
' they 're looking forward to it , the noise they 'll hear in the background in that stadium			0
' but they 're not just excited about the occasion , they want to get a result			0
' we 'll go through all emotions as a player for this one – they 'll get nervous , they 'll get excited			0
' but once you get on the field that determines how you are			0
' do we have what happened to @entity90 ( a 7 - 1 defeat in the @entity61 semi ) in our minds ? no , not at all , because you ca n't afford to think like that			1
' champions : @entity9 won the @entity61 in @entity90 , and are now looking to push on and win @entity97 @entity26 midfielder @entity16 has gone from a loan player at @entity99 to potentially a full @entity5 international in the space of a year			1
and @entity1 believes his selection is due reward for the player 's decision to prove himself in the game when it would have been easier to stagnate at @entity107			2
' i like to have people who can eliminate people and go by them , and he has shown that , ' he added			0
' not just this season , he has shown that last season at under - 21 level and @entity99 , which was great because he has done something about his career			2
' he has got off his backside at @entity99			0
it 's easy just to sit here			0
so i like that attitude			0
' he has come back and now he is playing with @entity26 and scoring goals , and going by people			2
' on top of the world : @entity58 kisses the @entity61 trophy after scoring the winner in the final against @entity60 @entity1 also heaped praise on @entity129 's @entity128 who seems set to win his third cap and make the @entity5 left - back slot his own just two years after plying his trade at @entity133			1
@entity128 had to rehabilitate himself with the @entity134 after his release by @entity26 – and mixed playing football with selling programmes at @entity138			2
' he 's playing well , ' @entity1 said of the former @entity140 man			1
' the boys loved him at @entity142 last week and i was speaking to someone who was playing at @entity129 yesterday and said he was terrific			0
' he 's another one who was selling programmes after being told he was n't needed at @entity26			2
' he dealt with that body blow and got on with it			0
