' black jesus ' : notorious cult leader @entity12 after he was captured in @entity11 in 2007 @entity12 , 40 , a failed @entity27 class student , called himself @entity3 as he travelled through the highland jungles in 2006 , gathering thousands of disciples who moved with him , following his instructions to increase his ' flock '			1
but he was also accused of raping three young girls , murdering them and then drinking their blood and eating their flesh			1
villagers eventually captured him in march 2007 , beat him into unconsciousness , tied him up and handed him over to police			0
in 2010 he was convicted of four counts of rape but was not charged with murder due to lack of evidence , despite protests by the relatives of three dead girls			2
now the enigmatic figure , who wore long white robes as he stood on a rock in a jungle clearing and preached his own gospel to his disciples , has sparked fears that he plans to look for new followers with his escape			1
' the guard left his tower , ' @entity57 ’s spokesman @entity56 told @entity60 today			0
capture : the feared @entity12 was beaten by villagers and tied up before being handed over to the police ' while the shift was taking place , the detainees used a tool to cut through a fence and they left for freedom			1
' ' we ’re working around the clock to find @entity12 and the other men , ' said @entity15 ’s acting provincial police commander inspector @entity73			2
during his days of freedom he gathered more than six thousand disciples by telling them they would recieve gifts from heaven if they followed him			2
followers : @entity12 gathered more than six thousand disciples with his preaching in the jungles ( library image ) but jungle communities were horrified to be told that @entity12 had sacrificed three young women , drinking their blood and eating their flesh as part of his bizarre religious ceremonies			1
in one case , a mother who had fallen under his influence , drank her daughter ’s blood , according to relatives who the @entity94 spoke to at the time			0
he gradually became a figure of fear			0
@entity12 was eventually captured in the small village of @entity99 , a seven - hour walk from the nearest road			0
@entity103 pastor @entity102 said it had been difficult for police to catch @entity12 as he never stayed for long in one place and was always warned by his disciples when police were in the area			1
when he turned up in @entity99 villa , frightened villagers pounced on him while he was sleeping in a hut and tied him up			0
messages were passed through villages until one man with a mobile phone was able to get a call to police in the town of @entity15			0
heavily - armed officers found the badly - beaten @entity12 tied to a makeshift stretcher when they arrived in the village			0
there was no sign of @entity126 ’ bow - and - arrow bodyguards who on an earlier occasion when @entity12 escaped had engaged in a fight to the death with police			2
