by @entity0 for the @entity1 three baby foods as well as crisps , cereals and chips contain raised levels of a chemical linked to cancer			2
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) found higher than expected levels of acrylamide in a range of popular products			1
the substance , which develops during the cooking process , has been linked to a higher risk of cancer			1
the @entity9 conducts annual tests for acrylamide in food products			1
its survey for 2013 , published this week , found high levels of the chemical in apple rice cakes from @entity39 , @entity41 baby wheat flakes and @entity43 breakfast banana multigrain for babies			1
also affected were crisps , cereals and some frozen potato products , which were found to be likely to develop too much acrylamide if cooked to package instructions			2
when food is cooked at high temperatures , a process called the @entity54 reaction makes it brown and adds taste and crunch			1
however , the reaction creates acrylamide			0
the chemical is also used in industry to make polymers for applications in paper making , water treatment and sealants			0
table shows which brands were tested for the chemical acrylamide - which has been linked to cancer the @entity9 ’s guidelines say that consumers should cook chips only to a light gold and should toast bread ‘ to the lightest colour acceptable ’ to reduce exposure to acrylamide			1
this week , the @entity78 ( @entity78 ) issued similar guidelines , including warning against storing potatoes in the fridge			0
this increases the sugar level , which is linked to browning , it said			0
it added : ‘ tests show that acrylamide in the diet causes cancer in animals			2
scientists conclude that acrylamide in food potentially increases cancer risk			1
’ the @entity93 has said the chemical ‘ indicates a human health concern ’ when found in food			0
dr @entity97 , an @entity9 specialist who heads @entity78 ’s committee on food contaminants , said that when acrylamide breaks down in the body , another substance called glycidamide is formed			1
she added : ‘ @entity103 is the most likely cause of gene mutations and tumours seen in animal studies			0
’ the @entity108 , which represents supermarkets , said acrylamide levels in food are falling			2
it added : ‘ retailers will continue to work with suppliers to limit the occurrence of acrylamide in foods			0
’ @entity117 , maker of @entity41 , said safety is ‘ incredibly important ’ and it is investigating the ‘ anomalous ’ result			0
@entity39 said it has reduced levels in its rice cakes since the tests and there is ‘ no cause for concern ’			0
@entity43 said its affected baby cereal has been discontinued .			2
