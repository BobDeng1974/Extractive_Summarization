by @entity0 drones that can choose to deviate from a set mission and hunt in ‘ swarms ’ could be patrolling skies within the next 25 years , according to a new roadmap			1
unmanned aircraft carrying stronger chemical weapons could also be on the horizon , the @entity8 @entity7 ( @entity7 ) revealed in its @entity12			1
while the document sets out plans for unmanned maritime , land and air vehicles , there is a lot of focus on the future capability of controversial drones , which , if the plans come to fruition , could deviate from mission commands set by humans if they spot a better target			2
the @entity8 @entity7 ( @entity7 ) revealed its @entity12 , which includes plans for drones that can swarm , deviate from a set mission and carry stronger chemical weapons			1
a current mq - 9 reaper drone used in @entity31 is pictured current drones require intensive manpower on the ground to fly , which is expensive and the @entity7 plans on cutting costs by letting the machines make more decisions themselves , @entity32 reported			1
at the moment drones follow precise commands to complete a predetermined step - by - step mission , but the unmanned aircraft of the future could deviate from tasks , informed by ‘ laws ’ that govern their behaviour , laid out in algorithms and machine learning , as well as advanced sensors			1
while drones , or unmanned aircraft , currently use gps to navigate war zones and remote areas , the satellite signals used by the systems can be jammed easily , so the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) is working on jam - proof ‘ inertial guidance systems ’			1
current drones require intensive manpower on the ground , which is expensive and the @entity7 plans on cutting costs by letting the machines make more decisions themselves			1
a demonstrator model of @entity69 , a pan-european stealth combat drone is pictured the @entity7 's roadmap also features plans for deadly ‘ swarms ’ of drone - bombs that are launched from an unmanned ‘ mothership ’ to circle the skies while a human operator searches for targets for the drones to crash into , guided by the bots ’ on - bard cameras			1
thanks to the unmanned mothership , the kamikaze drones could have a range of over 250 nautical miles ( 463km ) the roadmap said			2
the weapons dropped by more traditional drones are also set to get more deadly under the plans , as researchers are working on ‘ energetic nanoparticles ’ with a larger surface areas so that the chemicals within the ammunition reach faster and create a more powerful explosion			0
the technologies combined are intended to help the @entity8 military be ‘ more effective through greater automation and greater performance , ’ the report says			2
designer @entity101 's @entity100 guide has been likened to 21st century bird watching a @entity104 designer has penned the @entity105 , which like bird watching charts , shows the various shapes and sizes of flying objects by their silhouettes			0
@entity101 ’s guide , however , details the differing kinds of flying robots used at war , as well as survival tips of how to hide from them			0
the majority of the drones selected for the chart are from @entity121 member countries , including the @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity8 and @entity125			2
this is because these countries have used drones in wars such as @entity31 and are also more transparent than some other countries in disclosing information about the robots , such as their wingspan			0
it uses a skull icon to show that a drone is used for attack and a little eye to denote a surveillance vehicle			0
the chart , which mr @entity101 describes as ‘ 21st century bird watching ’ shows the vast array of flying war machines used today from the giant 130ft wingspan of the @entity146 drone to the petite @entity148 quadcopter , which measures just 23 inches			0
he said : ‘ most drones are used today by military powers for remote - controlled surveillance and attack and their numbers are growing			0
' the @entity154 ( @entity154 ) predicted in 2012 that within 20 years there could be as many as 30.000 drones flying over @entity8 soil alone			2
‘ as robotic birds will become commonplace in the near future , we should be prepared to identify them			0
this survival guide is an attempt to familiarise ourselves and future generations , with a changing technological environment			0

the @entity8 @entity7 ( @entity7 ) revealed its @entity12 , setting out its technology aims for the next 25 years
its plans include drone - bombs that can hunt in ' swarms ' from a mothership
next - generation unmanned aircraft will likely be *equipped* with better sensors and navigational *equipment* , plus *superior* *autonomous* systems
