by @entity0 a fisherman in @entity2 was left stunned when his latest haul included a piece of rocket			1
the sizeable chunk was found in the water and then dragged to shore by locals			1
although rockets regularly fall into the ocean , it is not often that pieces as large as this are recovered			0
scroll down for footage of the initial launch people and police officers look at debris from a spacecraft launched from the @entity22 spaceport in @entity23 in @entity24 - the @entity25 @entity24 territory adjoining @entity2 - after it was found by residents of @entity28 , a city 182 miles ( 293 kilometres ) from @entity29 , @entity2 , on 28 april 2014 the debris is from a spacecraft launched from the @entity22 spaceport in @entity23 in @entity24 , a @entity25 - @entity24 territory adjoining @entity2			1
ariane 5 is a rocket manufactured under the authority of the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) and the @entity36 ( @entity36 )			0
it is built by @entity38 and operated by @entity39			0
among its famous launches includes @entity42 , a @entity22 spacecraft that will land on a comet later this year			1
@entity32 carries payloads weighing more than 10 metric tons to geostationary transfer orbit ( @entity47 ) and over 20 metric tons into low - @entity48 ( @entity49 )			2
it lofts some of the heaviest spacecraft in production , which enables @entity39 to match up most telecommunications satellites for highly efficient dual launches			0
it is powered during the initial flight phase by a cryogenic core stage and two solid rocket boosters , followed by the use of a cryogenic upper stage for orbital injection of the payload			2
the rocket has a typical height of 165 feet ( 50 metres ) and weighs about 750 tons			0
the discovery was made by residents of @entity28 , a city 182 miles ( 293 km ) from the city of @entity29 in @entity2			2
it was confirmed to be a piece of rocket by the @entity70			0
' the object found in # @entity2 was fairing from the @entity32 rocket that launched @entity75 # lostandfound , ' they posted on @entity76			1
the piece of wreckage bears the logo of the @entity70 and @entity39 , the @entity22 satellite launch company			2
on the corner can also be seen party of the logo for @entity36 , the @entity24 space agency			2
the hunk of metal originates from an @entity32 rocket			1
specifically it is from the @entity88 , which launched on 25 july 2013			0
this mission carried two satellites into orbit , @entity92 ( @entity22 ’s largest ever telecommunications satellite ) and @entity94 ( a meteorological spacecraft for @entity95 )			1
it was the 70th flight of the @entity32 , @entity39 ’s heavy - lift launcher			0
the vehicle lifted off at 4:54pm local time , with flight time to orbit lasting 33 minutes			0
the piece of rocket was found by fisherman @entity104 , 73 , in the @entity105			2
it is a big plate of carbon fiber from the outer hull on the payload fairing			1
the piece of space wreckage bears the logo of the @entity70 , @entity39 ( the @entity22 satellite launch company ) and the @entity24 space agency @entity36 the piece of rocket found in @entity2 originated from an ariane 5 rocket ( circled in image ) that was launched on 25 july 2013			1
the mission , dubbed @entity88 , carried two satellites into orbit , @entity92 ( @entity22 's largest ever telecommunications satellite ) and @entity94 ( a meteorological spacecraft for @entity95 ) during ascent , certain parts of the spacecraft are expended			1
first , the expendable boosters on the side are jettisoned when they run out of fuel			0
later , the main ‘ payload fairing , ’ which is the section covering the top of the rocket , is also detached			1
it is from the payload fairing that this particular section of the rocket is from			1
the fairing is used to protect the interior spacecraft from intense heat and forces as the rocket passes through the atmosphere into space			1
most launchpads are located near vast uninhabited regions , such as open ocean or desert			0
the launchpad at @entity24 flies directly over the huge @entity145 , so as the parts are jettisoned they fall harmlessly into the water			2
in some rare instances such as this , though , pieces of the rocket can wash onto shore			0
on the debris were various markings that revealed its origin			0
at the top can be seen the year and contract number when the mission was first devised			0
this was the 70th flight for @entity39 's highly successful @entity32 family of rockets fisherman @entity104 , pictured front right , found the large piece of debris at the bottom of the @entity169			1
this location is about 370 miles ( 600 kilometres ) from @entity35 's @entity171 where the rocket originally launched from			0

a piece of a rocket that travelled into space has been found in @entity2
@entity178 was a @entity22 @entity32 rocket that launched from @entity24
the chunk of debris is part of the payload fairing that protects spacecraft
it is jettisoned as the rocket *journeys* to orbit and falls back to @entity190
it normally falls in an uninhabited area but this time it washed to shore
