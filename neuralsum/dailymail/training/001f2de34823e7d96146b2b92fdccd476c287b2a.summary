by @entity0 published : 12:26 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 12:29 est , 11 march 2014 scientists have detected four new man - made gases that damage the @entity6 's protective ozone layer			1
despite bans on almost all production of similar gases under a 1987 treaty , they were found in @entity12 's ice and in air samples in @entity14 , @entity15			1
experts are trying to pinpoint industrial sources of tiny traces of the new gases , and believe they may have been used in making pesticides or refrigerants			1
in 2002 the ozone hole split into two pieces			0
now scientists have detected four new man - made gases that damage the @entity6 's protective ozone layer @entity26 and @entity27 have been monitoring the ozone layer on the ground and with a variety of instruments on satellites and balloons since the 1970s			1
long - term ozone monitoring instruments have included @entity35 , @entity36 / 2 , @entity38 series of instruments , the @entity40 , the @entity41 , and the @entity43 instrument on the @entity45 satellite			0
the ozone layer shields the planet from damaging ultra-violet rays , which can cause skin cancer and eye cataracts , and has been recovering after a phase - out of damaging chemicals under the @entity53 's 1987 @entity52			2
' the concentrations are not yet a threat to the ozone layer , ' lead author @entity54 of the @entity55 in @entity56 told @entity59 of the three types of @entity61 ( chlorofluorocarbon ) and one @entity63 ( hydrochlorofluorocarbon )			0
in total , the scientists estimated more than 74,000 metric tons of the four had been released to the atmosphere			0
none was present before the 1960s in @entity12 's ice cores , according to the study in the journal @entity72			1
that is only a small fraction of the million metric tons of @entity61 produced every year at a 1980s peak , according to the team of scientists in @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity15 , @entity81 , the @entity82 and @entity83			1
@entity54 said it was unknown if the emissions of the new gases were illegal , since the @entity52 has some exemptions			2
' we hope to tighten the loopholes , ' he said			2
a fridge too far : researchers believe the new gases may have come from fridges or pesticides a hole in the ozone layer was found in the 1980s over @entity100 but bans on damaging chemicals , for instance used in hairsprays , foams and refrigerants , means it is on target to recover in the next 50 years			1
hcfcs have often been used to replace more damaging @entity61			0
one of the newly discovered @entity61 was worrying since concentrations were rising fast , @entity54 said			0
such emission increases had not been spotted for other @entity61 since the 1990s			0
the gases were detected earlier in @entity12 than @entity14 , indicating they were produced in the northern hemisphere and then blown south			1
research planes , taking air samples around the world , may be able to find the sources , @entity54 said			1
' while these newly discovered gases can , in theory , cause some damage to the ozone layer , their combined abundance is over 500 times smaller than that of the main ozone - destroying compounds in the 1990s , ' said @entity121 , a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the @entity123			2
' these new observations do not present concern at the moment , although the fact that these gases are in the atmosphere and some are increasing needs investigation , ' he said			0
@entity54 said the gases are also likely to be powerful greenhouse gases , albeit in tiny amounts			0
cfcs are often thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere .			0

believe they may have been used in making pesticides or refrigerants .
