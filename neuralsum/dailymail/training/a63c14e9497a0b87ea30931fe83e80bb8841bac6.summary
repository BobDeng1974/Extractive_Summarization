mr @entity19 spent months completing the stunning wall , which he painted from scaffolding surrounding the cafe			1

@entity22 is believed to have taken great effort to study the figure of the sibyl , called @entity146 , more than many others on the ceiling , which is considered a cornerstone of @entity151 art. his intention was for the sibyl to be looking directly at the fresco below , which features @entity155 baptising @entity156 in the @entity157			0
