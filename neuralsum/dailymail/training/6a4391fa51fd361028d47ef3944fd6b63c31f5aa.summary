by @entity0 @entity1 looked straight out at his audience			1
he measured his words , slowly , to add emphasis			1
he pronounced every last syllable			1
‘ i ’ll be truthful , ’ he said			1
‘ i am going to do anything in my power to win this next game			1
i am prepared to do anything and i am talking anything			1
‘ i ’m being serious			2
it is do or die			2
i ’m hungry , i ’m confident and i ’m so happy to be out here			2
do i want to go home early ? no. i want to win this @entity15 like everyone back home wants us to win it and i ’d be gutted to go out in the group			1
‘ it means the world to me to play for @entity19 and i ’d be devastated if that happened			1
so , yes , anything			2
and i ’m being totally honest with you guys			2
’ as the question had concerned @entity48 ’s assertion that @entity21 would use any means necessary to win a @entity15 game - and he produced quite an exhaustive list of dark arts as evidence - it was amusing to watch the colour drain from the faces of the @entity56 as @entity1 spoke			1
dr @entity57 and the @entity56 ’s media squad are working so hard to control the inner chimps out here and then @entity1 goes and fills the room with talk of monkey business			1
he clarified , of course			2
he would n’t cheat , he said			2
would n’t dive , would n’t punch the ball off the line to deny a @entity68 winner - not that he will often be in that position , to be fair - would only act within the laws of the game			1
@entity72 has bigger worries than @entity18 cool finish : @entity1 connects with @entity76 's cross to pull @entity19 level against @entity78 on saturday night reaching for the stars : @entity1 points to the sky following his strike during @entity19 's defeat to @entity78 roar talent : @entity1 , congratulated by @entity84 , lets it all out after scoring for @entity19 yet , deep down , those in the room knew what he meant			1
@entity89 said he did n’t cheat in 1998 , either			2
he just did n’t struggle manfully to stay on his feet when he thought a tumbling alternative might win the game			2
suffice to say , if @entity93 had received the same penalty area contact as @entity95 in @entity96 on saturday , maybe @entity19 would be reflecting on a 2 - 2 draw with @entity78			1
‘ we ’re an honest country , ’ he said			2
‘ we go about our business in an honest way			2
no disrespect to other countries , i ’m sure they are honest , too			2
‘ but we play within the laws of the game			2
we do n’t bend the rules			2
we play by the book			2
there ’s nothing wrong with that			2
we ’ve gone a long way doing it , from 1966 when we won the @entity15			1
we played within the laws and that ’s how i was brought up , how everyone in our squad was brought up			0
tumble : @entity89 goes to ground under the challenge of @entity118 during @entity119 ' 98 @entity1 has scored three goals in his last four @entity19 games - against @entity78 , @entity122 and @entity123			1
he averages 0.63 goals per game in an @entity19 shirt			1
‘ we do n’t like to cheat to win			0
we want to play in an honest way			0
that ’s how i feel football should be played			0
‘ i will stay on my feet			0
i will never dive on purpose to get some guy sent off			0
i ’m not going to handle a goal to stop the ball going in the net because it ’s not in my nature			0
so not diving , but i will do anything - just like every single one of my team - mates - as @entity21 will , too			1
they ’re hungry , just like us			0
and we ’ll work our socks off , do more than we ’ve ever done before			0
’ up at @entity21 ’s training base in @entity143 near @entity144 , @entity18 - a man who might not have added those calming qualifications at the end of such a speech - was declaring himself 100 per cent fit to face @entity19			1
he ca n’t be , of course			0
if he was 100 per cent on monday , he would have been around 80 per cent at the weekend and would surely have been introduced by @entity21 ’s coach @entity150 when the second @entity152 goal went in			1
neither side is going to offer psychological advantage or candid insights into team selection at this stage and , despite protestations to the contrary , @entity19 ’s players were definitely guided not to make this match all about one man			1
sidelined : @entity18 watched on from the bench during @entity21 's shock 3 - 1 defeat to @entity167 on saturday @entity1 met any direct question about his @entity170 team - mate with a vague , generic reply praising the entire @entity68 team			1
so ask @entity18 , get @entity174 , @entity175 or a bland overview of a starting xi that to most eyes appears less than the sum of one part			0
most definitely , there is a risk of thinking that any single man is a team			0
yet with @entity21 it is an undeniable truth that , like @entity185 , an individual has dragged them to this @entity15			1
@entity21 sneaked in as the final @entity189 qualifiers , via a play - off win against @entity191			1
without @entity18 , however , they were undone by @entity167 and in the second half their physically imposing yet clunky defence looked every day of its advancing age			0
@entity197 : @entity18 does some stretching during a @entity21 training session on sunday in @entity143 @entity19 will hope to exploit those same weaknesses in @entity200 on thursday while playing down the fear that @entity18 is planning to do the same to them , on the evidence of the 2 - 1 defeat by @entity78			1
asked what he will be telling @entity19 ’s defenders about his club partner , @entity1 offered that he was unpredictable , a tip as helpful as the knowledge that he will be wearing light blue			1
still , there is an element of honesty about it at least			0
what is the defence mechanism against a player with @entity18 ’s mesmerising talent ? as @entity219 found against @entity220 on sunday night , the true greats defy containment			0
for 65 minutes , they gave the little master barely a kick			0
and then he won the day for @entity225			0
‘ i think these days there is a lot of unpredictability in the best players ’ games , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ @entity18 , @entity232 , @entity220 , @entity233			0
you ca n’t tell players what to do against those guys			0
‘ show @entity238 down the line and he ’ ll go another way , show @entity238 on his left foot and he ’ll go on his right			0
@entity243 man : @entity220 won the day for @entity225 as he scored the match - winner against @entity219 ‘ the best are unpredictable and @entity18 is unpredictable			1
so it ’s not for us to worry just about @entity18			0
we ’re the players that are up against him most , the @entity247 defenders			0
we know him better than anyone else at the @entity15			1
‘ sure , he ’s a world - class player , but we ’re facing @entity21 , with @entity175 and @entity174 , who is a legend in @entity21 and has done really well in @entity254			1
there are other players who are technically very gifted			0
‘ would i want @entity18 to be injured ? would i want to play against him ? it does n’t really matter			0
if @entity18 is fit , good luck to him			0
if not , there ’ll be another hungry player doing his best			0
we ’re worrying about @entity21 as a team , not just him			1
‘ if they had won their last game against @entity167 there would n’t have been such an obsession about him being fit			0
if they had won , people would have thought : “ oh , they ’re ok without @entity18 ”			0
‘ because they lost , people think no @entity18 is the reason behind it all			0
but it ’s just speculation			0
he could have played and they might still have lost			0
‘ look , we ’re playing @entity21			1
i do n’t think they will be saying to watch out for @entity1 or @entity76 or @entity95			1
we spoke a lot about @entity273 before the first game , but it still needed @entity275 to hit the ball in from all of 25 yards for their goal			0

@entity1 vows to do whatever it takes to defeat @entity21
@entity19 *frontman* scored during 2 - 1 defeat to @entity78 on saturday
@entity170 striker admits he would be ' gutted ' to go out of the @entity15 at the group stage
