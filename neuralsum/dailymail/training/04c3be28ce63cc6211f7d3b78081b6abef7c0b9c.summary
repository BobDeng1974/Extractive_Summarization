@entity0 rerouted a flight to @entity2 over @entity3 after airspace above @entity5 was closed after the downing of @entity7			1
@entity10 flight tracking service @entity8 posted a flight map on its @entity13 account showing the change in the route of @entity0 flight @entity16 , which flies to @entity18			2
flight tracking data showed this flight had previously crossed over eastern @entity5			1
the controversial move comes after @entity29 was shot down thursday by a ground - to - air missile in eastern @entity5			1
all 298 passengers and crew on board the flight were killed			0
since then , airlines have been told to avoid the airspace above where the @entity5 military has been fighting @entity39 - backed rebels			1
@entity40 , chief executive officer of @entity8 , said it was relatively unusual for transcontinental flights to cross @entity3			2
‘ with @entity44 you always see aircraft flying there			0
there is no other way to access parts of the @entity49 than to use the @entity44 corridor , ’ he said			0
‘ but you do n't see @entity3 so often			2
we saw no other trans - continental flight that went through @entity3 airspace yesterday			1
’ some regional traffic uses @entity3 airspace including a @entity58 flight bound for @entity59 on monday , according to the @entity8 website			1
aviation experts said governments must take the lead in deciding just where it is safe for airlines to fly			1
controversial move : @entity0 used a route over @entity3 war zone just days after its jet , pictured , was hit by a missile flying over @entity5 airlines have flown , safely , over war zones for many years but the tragic incident involving flight @entity7 must lead to a re-assessment of the route decision process , the experts said			1
@entity79 , director - general and chief executive of the @entity81 ( @entity81 ) said : ‘ governments will need to take the lead in reviewing how airspace risk assessments are made			1
‘ and the industry will do all that it can to support governments , through @entity87 ( the @entity87 ) , in the difficult work that lies ahead			0
’ @entity89 , visiting professor in aviation security at @entity91 , said : ‘ at the moment the approval process leaves it very much up to the airlines to make the final decision on which routes they fly			2
‘ the security organisations within governments have all the risk information for areas of conflict			0
‘ if there is a chance that those fighting in a war zone have sophisticated , long - range weaponry then it should be up to the security organisations to say that that area should be completely avoided by airlines			2
’ prof @entity89 continued : ‘ i think it would be very difficult to have a flying ban put over all areas of conflict			0
@entity0 have been passing over war zones for some time			0
‘ planes flying at high , cruising altitudes are just not in danger from most land - based weaponry			2
but if there is information that aircraft could be at risk then it is essential that information is passed on to aviation authorities , including air traffic control organisations			0
’ @entity0 said @entity16 's flight plan was in accordance with the @entity87 's ( @entity87 ) approved routes			0
@entity0 flight @entity7 taking off from @entity134 in @entity134 before it was shot down ‘ as per the notice to airmen ( notam ) issued by the @entity3 @entity140 , the @entity3 airspace was not subject to restrictions , ’ @entity0 said in a statement			1
‘ at all times , @entity16 was in airspace approved by @entity87			0
’ @entity87 , which said last week it had no operational role and did not have the authority to open or close routes , did not respond to repeated requests for comment			0
@entity149 , a former chief counsel at the @entity150 and secretary of the @entity153 - based @entity152 , questioned the wisdom of flying ‘ over hotly contested territory ’ but said he was not aware of a credible threat against airliners flying in @entity3 airspace			1
@entity159 , president of @entity160 , one of the world 's largest airlines , said it was difficult to avoid flying over conflict zones on main routes between @entity49 and @entity167			2
airlines assume that when a flight plan is accepted in controlled airspace , it is safe to fly on that particular route , @entity159 said			1
there may have to be changes in the way the industry assesses such risks in light of the @entity7 disaster , he added			0
hundreds of flights routinely crossed over @entity5 before thursday 's incident , and it is not unusual for international airlines to fly over war zones such as @entity185			1
@entity186 , a lecturer at @entity188 's @entity187 in @entity189 , said he did not think the @entity3 government would fire missiles at airliners			0
‘ the question is : who has access to these ( missiles ) and what is the range ? ’ he said			0
the @entity150 , whose regulations are among the world 's strictest , ‘ strongly discourages ’ @entity153 operators from flying to , from or over @entity3 , according to a may 2013 notice on its website .			1

airline changed the route from flying above @entity5 after downing of @entity7
@entity208 said no other trans - continental flight used @entity3 airspace
@entity153 ' strongly discourages ' airlines from flying to or over @entity3
governments ' must take lead ' in deciding where is safe for airlines to fly
