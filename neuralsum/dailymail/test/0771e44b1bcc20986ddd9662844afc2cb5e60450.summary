common creams used to treat athlete 's foot and eczema could undo the damage of multiple sclerosis , scientists claim			1
the surprise discovery could pave the way to ground - breaking new therapies for the devastating auto - immune disease , which affects around 2.5 million worldwide			0
scientists found that the anti-fungal agent miconazole and the steroid clobetasol both restored movement to mice paralysed by a rodent version of multiple sclerosis ( @entity16 )			1
in laboratory tests , they prompted inactive mouse and human stem cells to regenerate myelin , the protective insulation - like coating around nerve fibres that is destroyed by the disease			1
common creams used to treat athlete 's foot and eczema could cure multiple sclerosis , scientists claim dr @entity28 , of the @entity30 team from @entity31 who carried out the study , said the results marked a significant breakthrough			1
he said : ' it was a striking reversal of disease severity in the mice			0
' the drugs that we identified are able to enhance the regenerative capacity of stem cells in the adult nervous system			1
' this truly represents a paradigm shift in how we think about restoring function to multiple sclerosis patients			1
' @entity48 is sold over the counter in most pharmacies as a cream to treat athlete 's foot , while clobetasol cream is commonly prescribed to treat eczema			0
although both drugs are widely used , a way must be found to use them safely as internal human treatments rather than creams or ointments before clinical trials can be considered			2
the researchers are confident this problem can be solved , but have warned patients not to jump the gun by using the drugs prematurely			0
lead scientist professor @entity67 , from @entity68 , said : ' we appreciate that some patients or their families feel they can not wait for the development of specific approved medications , but off - label use of the current forms of these drugs is more likely to increase other health concerns than alleviate multiple sclerosis symptoms			1
' we are working tirelessly to ready a safe and effective drug for clinical use			0
' @entity16 is a condition of the central nervous system , where the coating around nerve fibres ( called myelin ) is damaged , causing a range of symptoms			1
the specific symptoms that appear depend upon which part of the central nervous system is affected and the job of the damaged nerve			0
people with @entity16 might suffer fatigue , vision problems and difficulties with walking , but the condition is different for everyone			2
symptoms can come and go and can vary greatly in terms of severity there may be periods of relapse of varying length and severity			0
at present , there is no cure for @entity16 but the symptoms can be treated			2
it is usually diagnosed in people aged 20 to 40 , and it affects almost three times as many women as men			0
worldwide , it is estimated that more than 2.5 million people have ms. source : @entity121 @entity16 occurs when the immune system attacks myelin , thereby disrupting the passage of nerve signals			1
as the disease progresses , it produces symptoms ranging from mild numbness or tingling to full blown paralysis			0
occasionally , it can prove fatal			0
although current treatments can slow progression of @entity16 and reduce its symptoms , the disease remains incurable			2
one new approach is to focus on special stem cells called oligodendrocyte progenitor cells ( @entity137 ) that mature into myelin - producing cells			1
while other scientists have looked at ways of replacing lost stem cells using transplantation techniques , the @entity31 team set out to find a way of stimulating existing , but inactive , @entity145			1
after screening 727 potential drug candidates , they identified two - miconazole and clobetasol - that coaxed the @entity137 to form oligodendrocytes and repair nerve fibres stripped of myelin			1
' we know that there are stem cells throughout the adult nervous system that are capable of repairing the damage caused by multiple sclerosis , but until now , we had no way to direct them to act , ' said prof @entity67			1
' our approach was to find drugs that could catalyse the body 's own stem cells to replace the cells lost in multiple sclerosis			1
' as well as testing the drugs on mice affected by @entity16 , the scientists also observed their effect on human opcs in the laboratory			2
the response was similar to that seen in mouse cells , with miconazole exerting the most potent effect			0
co-author dr @entity175 , also from @entity31 , said : ' we have pioneered technologies that enable us to generate both mouse and human opcs in our laboratory			0
' this uniquely positioned us to test if these drugs could also stimulate human @entity182 to generate new myelinating cells			0
' scientists said the finding was significant as it could pave the way to new therapies for @entity16 , which affects around 2.5 million worldwide the drugs also hold out the promise of treatments for other diseases that involve myelin loss or dysfunction , including cerebral palsy , age - related dementia , optic neuritis and schizophrenia , the scientists believe			2
@entity199 immunology expert professor @entity198 , from @entity200 , said : ' this study offers the highly attractive possibility of re-targeting existing , safe , drugs for the purpose of promoting therapeutic remyelination			0
' the data appear to suggest that the drugs can to some extent limit disability in experimental models of @entity16 , though there is clearly much more to be optimised in this area , not least as the models tried thus far do not really look at effects on chronic demyelination			2
' however , particularly for patients with progressive @entity16 - where it can be difficult to know how to impact the ongoing deterioration , these approaches offer the great advantage that these are tried , tested and safe drugs passed for use in humans			2
' some caution is clearly warranted , however , when one considers the long haul from benefits in tissue culture models of myelination to a complex and diverse human disease such as @entity16 ' the findings were published in the journal @entity231 .			0

active *ingredients* in creams were found to cure multiple sclerosis ( @entity16 )
they prompted stem cells to reverse the nerve damage caused by @entity16
cells regenerated myelin , the coating around nerve fibres that @entity16 destroys
team is looking for ways the creams can be safely used as treaments
