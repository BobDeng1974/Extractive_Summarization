by @entity0 published : 13:59 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 14:04 est , 29 january 2014 there 's nothing quite like bathing beneath the stars , even if the rest of your bathroom has crumbled into an abandoned mine			2
that was the fate of the family who live in this house - swallowed up by one of @entity14 's countless unplotted shafts			1
they fled the semi-detached home earlier this week after two - inch cracks appeared in the walls			1
then today just after 5am , a ' loud rumbling ' gave neighbours a rude awakening			0
shall we go back to mine ? @entity25 would love this attractive open - air bathroom ... after one wall collapsed into an abandoned mine shaft this morning			2
the family in @entity30 , @entity14 , had fled after seeing cracks exposed : it is thought the hole was been covered with slowly - rotting railway sleepers hundreds of years ago an entire corner of the stone three - bedroom house toppled into the mine shaft , which was most likely used to harvest tin and copper			1
it is believed the hole in the town of @entity30 could have lain undetected for hundreds of years covered only by slowly - rotting railway sleepers			1
the road has been shut outside the rubble - strewn house and cars are being directed around the scene with temporary traffic lights			2
@entity49 , who lives in the house with his wife , his son and his son 's fiancée , told the @entity55 he had raised the alarm after seeing cracks in the walls			1
@entity59 added : ' we noticed a huge crack in the house			0
it was as if a couple of huge lorries were passing by			0
' room with a view : if nothing else , the house now stands out from its neighbours			0
in the nearby village of @entity73 engineers are working on a £ 1.6m project to stop homes sliding into a 300 - year - old tunnel network the heavy rain deluging @entity78 has opened up several holes in the ground			1
yesterday a gap opened up in a road near the @entity14 town of @entity84			1
and engineers are due to finish a £ 1.6 million project to stop a row of houses from collapsing into a network of 300 - year - old shafts in the village of @entity73 , two miles from today 's incident			2
the houses are held up by huge steel girders and piles 46ft deep in the earth			0
@entity97 , @entity30 conservation officer for @entity98 , told @entity99 : ' there 've been a number of collapses in former mining settlements			1
' there are unplotted shafts and several collapses in gardens which seem to happen very quickly			2
' when you find one you need to sort it out quickly and it usually involves capping the shafts with a concrete plug or a grill			0
' people used to use railway sleepers or build a hedge around the entrances			0
' it 's a minefield : @entity14 's mining rush in the mid- 1800s left a large number of dangerous unmapped shafts a @entity98 spokesman confirmed a corner the home had collapsed into a ' mine feature ' and was unoccupied at the time			1
' @entity129 ... co-ordinated switching off services and fencing off the property , ' the spokesman added			0
' the situation is in the hands of the insurance company and loss adjusters , who our structural engineers are liaising with to determine a plan to make the building secure and remediate			0
' our structural engineers will be keeping a close eye on future investigations with respect to highway safety and any subsequent remediation should it affect the highway			0
' there is no timescale at present for the works			0
' at their peak in the mid- 1800s there were 400 active mines across @entity14 , which broke new ground in technology and exported their skills all over the world			1
the county had been exporting metals for thousands of years , with copper used for coins while tin became used for storing food			1
but the rush of industry left many dangerous unmapped shafts , and others which were open to ramblers and children who did n't watch their step .			0
