@entity0 has confirmed he will pick @entity1 for his next @entity3 squad , but that @entity4 remains his favoured striker in the international set - up			1
@entity1 has burst on the scene this season , scoring 23 times for @entity10 in all competitions , and @entity0 revealed last thursday he was willing to bring the @entity3 under 21 striker into the senior set - up			1
by contrast @entity4 has been frozen out of his favoured attacking position for @entity16 for much of the campaign , and in the 3 - 1 @entity19 win at @entity20 on monday he scored his first goal since @entity22			1
@entity3 boss @entity0 ( centre ) watches @entity16 take on @entity20 at @entity24 on monday alongside @entity25 ( left ) and @entity26 ( right ) @entity0 was in the @entity28 studio a a pundit for the @entity19 fifth round clash but @entity0 , who was speaking on the @entity28 as a pundit for the @entity19 fifth round tie at @entity24 , admitted that he admires the quality of strikers he now has at his disposal compared to when he took over from @entity35 in 2012			1
@entity0 said : ' we think back two or three years when i started but up front we did n’t have enormous depth			2
' we saw quite a few youngsters but not that many			0
@entity40 ? he 's done very well			0
you have to wait until the 19th to see if i pick him , as well as @entity44			0
i really do admire them all			0
@entity0 indicated he will pick @entity1 for the @entity3 squad			2
here @entity1 celebrates scoring against @entity47 for @entity10 last tuesday in a @entity49 clash at @entity50 @entity1 is already a big player at @entity51 level for @entity3 and his form has caught the eye of @entity0 ' @entity1 ? he is an all - round centre forward , can play right up there against a centre back , or come off and see a pass			1
' he 's got technique , he ’s always looking to get on the end of crosses , that header against @entity63 was a really classy header			0
i thought that was a wonderful			0
' if all goes well and he stays fit i ’m pretty sure he ’ll be in the next squad			2
@entity4 celebrates scoring @entity16 's third goal in a 3 - 1 win at @entity20 - his first since @entity22 but despite playing midfield for much of the campaign , @entity0 has stated @entity72 is still his first choice @entity3 striker			1
@entity72 celebrates scoring in a friendly against @entity76 in november even though @entity0 admitted his pleasure at seeing strikers showing form to earn a call - up , the @entity3 boss added that @entity72 was still key to the @entity3 playing as a striker			1
' at the moment i 'd like to see him [ @entity72 ] as a key figure for us as a centre forward , it would take a lot before i ’d start to think along those lines [ @entity72 as a midfielder ]			2
' he ’s our captain and nearly the record goalscorer			0
it would take a lot from a 19 or 20 - year - old to replace a man up front with over 100 caps , there ’d be a lot of pressure			0

@entity0 was speaking as a *tv* pundit for @entity20 vs @entity16
@entity3 manager admitted @entity4 is still key as a centre forward
@entity0 pleased with the competition for striker places in his squad
