by @entity0 published : 06:29 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 10:36 est , 14 june 2013 a woman who claims she was raped by a @entity2 at the @entity4 barracks has waived her anonymity to speak out about her ordeal			1
@entity7 , 23 , said she thought she would be ' safe ' among the marines during a party at the base following an @entity12 baseball game in @entity13 she told @entity14 : ' in my head , i thought these are people who are supposed to be protecting me			1
a marine invited her to a party at a pub on the base , where she entered in the early hours of july 5 without needing to show @entity34 ms @entity35 told @entity14 that the group drank ' a lot ' of @entity39 whiskey shots and another marine became sexually aggressive			1
she says he pinned her against a wall , got close to her face and repeatedly told her : ' i 'm going to [ blank ] you			0
' ' i was very scared , ' she said			0
' i can just remember being in excruciating pain and crying and asking him to stop			0
' ms @entity35 claims the alleged attacker , master sgt @entity48 , tried to force her into a cab with him after he raped her , but she refused			1
master sgt @entity48 is accused of raping ms @entity7 and faces a court martial ' he got within six inches of my face and started screaming obscenities at me , which prompted the guard i was standing next to to hold up his arm and say , " stand down " , ' she said			1
ms @entity35 said she visited hospital a week after the attack and reported the alleged assault to police a week later			1
this week , a @entity2 general ordered that @entity48 should be charged with rape , indecent exposure and disorderly conduct reports @entity14			1
previously , a local prosecutor ruled that @entity48 would not be charged because the evidence amounted to ' he said , she said ' , following her testimony to a grand jury			2
a previous @entity2 investigator said the allegations were ' baseless ' and should be dismissed , but recommended bringing lesser charges against @entity48			2
the marine 's lawyer , @entity71 , claims the new charge is politically influenced by publicity around sexual assaults in the @entity77 military			1
the charge sheet against @entity48 alleges that ms @entity7 was ' incapable of consenting			1
due to impairment by alcohol , and that her impairment was known or reasonably should have been known by the accused			0
' the 22 - year - old marine served in @entity86 and was awarded the @entity87 for his 2010 tour of duty in @entity89 , his lawyer said			0
a @entity2 spokesman would not comment on the @entity48 case , including the accusation from @entity93 that the case was being influenced by politics			2
@entity96 , who teaches military law at @entity98 , said it was rare for a senior authority to order charges to be brought when an investigator had recommended they be dismissed			2
he told @entity14 the @entity2 general who ordered @entity48 be charged , major general @entity103 , was navigating a ' minefield ' in the wake of the case of @entity107 , whose conviction for sexual assault was overturned by an @entity111 general			1
@entity48 faces court martial on charges of rape , indecent exposure and disorderly conduct this drew fire from members of @entity120 who said top military officials should not be allowed to make decisions in sexual assault cases			1
mr @entity96 said the @entity103 faced accusations of being unwilling to ' make the difficult decision ' to send @entity48 to trial if he had not ordered the court martial			1
the military law expert said ms @entity7 's acknowledgement that she and her friends had been drinking could help the prosecution to show she was unable to defend herself or call for help			1
the issues surrounding sexual assault within the military are being examined by the @entity136 , which has been considering seven bills			1
the measures include one requiring a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison for a member of the armed services convicted of rape or sexual assault in a military court			1
both the @entity146 and @entity136 appear determined to shake up the military 's culture in ways that would ensure victims that if they report a crime , their allegations wo n't be discounted and their careers wo n't be jeopardized			0
the committee last week approved provisions in the defense bill that included stripping military commanders of the power to overturn convictions in rape and sexual assault cases			1
the panel also voted to require that anyone found guilty of a sex - related crime receive a punishment that includes , at a minimum , a dismissal from military service or a dishonorable discharge			0
the attack allegedly took place at the @entity172 in @entity13 officers , commissioned warrant officers , cadets and midshipmen convicted of rape , sexual assault , forcible sodomy or attempts to commit those offenses would be dismissed under a mandatory minimum sentence			1
enlisted personnel and noncommissioned warrant officers convicted of similar crimes would be dishonorably discharged			0
in one hearing , senator @entity187 told the committee he could not advise women to join the military amid the widespread reports of sexual assaults within the armed forces			2
he also questioned what the impact of the crimes would be on both male and female recruits if the military did not tackle the problem			0
senator @entity187 said : ' at its core , this is an issue about defending basic human rights but it 's also a long - term threat to the strength of our military			0
' we have to ask ourselves : if left uncorrected , what impact will this problem have on recruitment and retention of qualified men and women ? '' i can not overstate my disgust and disappointment over continued reports of sexual misconduct in our military			2
we â€™ve been talking about this issue for years and talk is insufficient			0
' the @entity221 estimated recently that as many as 26,000 military members may have been sexually assaulted last year , up from an estimated 19,000 assaults in 2011 , based on an anonymous survey of military personnel			0
while the number of sexual assaults that members of the military actually reported rose 6 percent to 3,374 in 2012 , thousands of victims were still unwilling to come forward despite new oversight and assistance programs aimed at curbing the crimes , the report said			2
there were nearly 800 reports of sexual assault cases in the @entity111 last year , ranging from inappropriate touching to rape			1
that is a nearly 30 per cent increase from 2011 , when 614 cases were reported			0
many of those cases stem from a single base near @entity246 where dozens of young female recruits and airmen were victimized by their instructors			0
an inquiry into @entity251 found that 32 military training instructors allegedly engaged in inappropriate or coercive sexual relationships with 59 recruits and airmen at @entity251 , according to the @entity111			2
six instructors have been convicted in courts - martial on charges ranging from adultery , rape and conducting unprofessional relationships			2
nine more instructors are awaiting courts - martial			0
two more received nonjudicial punishments			0
fifteen 15 instructors remain under investigation			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
