by @entity0 crude : @entity1 killed herself just days after being duped by @entity5 radio @entity3 the chairman of the radio station behind the hoax ' royal call ' that resulted in the death of duped nurse @entity1 crudely brushed the incident off today by declaring to shareholders that 's * * * happens '			1
at the annual meeting of shareholders of @entity19 radio station @entity18 - in @entity20 today , chairman @entity15 tried to play down the controversy with a crude , casual throw - away line			1
' these incidents were unfortunate , no doubt about that , ' he said			0
' but in the immortal words of someone whose identity i can not recall , s * * * happens			0
' it was last december that presenters @entity33 and @entity35 called king edward vii hospital where the @entity37 was being treated pretending to be the @entity38 and prince @entity39			1
mrs @entity40 failed to see through their poor impersonations and transferred them through to another nurse who revealed some details about her condition			2
three days later @entity1 was found hanged at her @entity48 accommodation			1
only two months ago , it emerged that in one of the three letters she left , mrs @entity40 directly accused the two @entity5 djs of driving her to her death			0
@entity5 djs @entity33 ( right ) and @entity35 ( left ) were responsible for hoax calls to the hospital treating the @entity37 she even said they should pay the mortgage for the @entity59 home where her accountant husband @entity60 , 49 , and children @entity62 , 17 , and @entity63 , 14 , still live			1
in the handwritten note , addressed to her managers at the @entity67 hospital , she said : ‘ please accept my apologies			2
thank you for all your support			0
prank : the @entity5 djs rang king edward vii hospital where the @entity37 was being treated for morning sickness and tried to get information about her condition ‘ i hold the @entity77 @entity33 and @entity35 responsible for this act			1
please make them pay my mortgage			0
’ after the meeting he was asked whether he had any regrets about his comment			1
' i think it was a one - sentence comment was n't it ? ' he told @entity88			2
' i have no comment			2
i made a comment in one sentence			2
i am glad the media is so busy			0
' shareholders were told that revenue from the company 's metropolitan radio stations , which include the @entity18 and @entity98 networks , fell last year due due to scandals involving presenter @entity100 - who on one occasion called an editor a ' fat slag ' - and what the company called ' the @entity107 incident '			0
the company suspended all advertising on @entity18 after the royal hoax scandal , but it did not prevent chief executive @entity111 's total pay rising by more than $ 350,000 ( £ 210,000 ) to $ 1.66 million ( £ 958,000 ) during the last financial year			0
the scandal also did not prevent one of the @entity3 , mr @entity35 , winning a ' @entity116 ' award - while his co-presenter , @entity117 , remained in shock at the consequences of the hoax call and was unable to return to work			1
an inquest into the death of miss @entity40 was adjourned last month after @entity125 coroner dr @entity124 asked the family to supply medical records that might provide evidence about her state of mind at the time of her death .			0
