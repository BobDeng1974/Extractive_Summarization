by @entity0 published : 08:03 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 11:16 est , 24 july 2013 the remains of the oldest @entity4 fort in @entity5 have been unearthed by a team of archaeologists from the @entity8			1
the remnants of the building , which was constructed by @entity12 would - be colonists , were discovered in the foothills of the @entity14 - a sub range of the @entity16			2
named @entity18 , it was destroyed less than 18 months after it was built , but is historically significant because it marks the end of @entity12 attempts to colonise @entity5 - clearing the way for the @entity23			1
buried : although the settlement of @entity26 was discovered in 2004 , the fort has proved elusive until now protection : the v - shaped @entity12 moat was a key part of the fort 's defences but could n't save it in the end built by @entity12 captain @entity34 in 1567 , the fort pre-dates sir @entity36 's doomed colony at @entity37 by almost 20 years , while the @entity39 settlement , which marked the start of the @entity23 domination of @entity5 , was n't built for another four decades			1
almost 300 miles from the @entity44 coast , the fort was occupied for just 18 months before it was destroyed by @entity46 tribesmen and all but one of the 120 soldiers in the garrison killed			1
the settlement protected by the forts , @entity26 , was also destroyed by the @entity53 - ending @entity12 colonial ambitions in @entity5 in the process			1
although remains of some of the @entity26 homes had previously been discovered , the fort itself had proved elusive until now			0
' we have known for more than a decade where the @entity12 soldiers were living , ' revealed @entity63 , an archaeologist from @entity64			2
reimagining : @entity66 's @entity65 of the @entity67 depicts the early @entity12 colonists remains : artifacts left behind by @entity12 settlers include this clothing hook , used to fasten doublets settlements : this map shows where the seven doomed forts once stood , including @entity18 ( @entity78 ) ' this summer we were trying to learn more about the @entity81 mound at @entity82 , one that was built by the people of @entity78 [ a @entity86 settlement ] , and instead we discovered part of the fort			1
for all of us , it was an incredible moment			0
' using a combination of large - scale excavations and magnetrometry , which produces x-ray like images of the site , scientists were able to pinpoint sections of the fort , including the moat and a gravelled surface that is likely to have been the entrance to the fort			0
the searchers also discovered @entity12 majolica pottery and other artifacts including iron nails and a hook thought to have been used to button doublets			2
the @entity12 garrison are thought to have been searching for gold in the foothills of the @entity14 with - they thought - the blessing of local tribespeople			1
' the soldiers believed that when their gifts were accepted , it meant that the native people were their subjects , ' said @entity118 of the @entity8			0
intact : the corner bastion , moat and entryway are visible in this shot , taken from the south side of the fort success : @entity118 ( right ) , @entity126 ( centre ) and @entity128 ( right ) led the team of archaeologists ' but to the natives , it was simply an exchange			0
when the soldiers ran out of gifts , they expected the natives to keep on feeding them			0
' the same thing nearly happened to [ @entity23 ] colonists at @entity39 , ' he revealed			2
' the colonists nearly starved to death during the winter of 1609 but @entity39 was in a very different situation to that of @entity18 and @entity26			0
' @entity147 settlers kept coming but when @entity18 fell , it was gone for good			0
' archaeologist @entity149 , of @entity150 , added : ' the events at @entity18 represent a microcosm of the colonial experience across the continent			0
' @entity12 's failure created an opening that @entity147 exploited at @entity39 , when @entity5 's familiar frontier narrative begins			1
' for @entity159 , though , this was the beginning of a long - term and often tragic reshaping of their precolonial world			2

@entity18 was built in 1567 , long before the @entity23 colony at @entity37
the fort was destroyed by local @entity159 less than 18 months later
its demise marked the end of @entity12 attempts to colonise @entity5
