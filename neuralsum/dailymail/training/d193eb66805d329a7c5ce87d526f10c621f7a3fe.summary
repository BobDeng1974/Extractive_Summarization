it has emerged that almost a dozen @entity1 have left the @entity3 state to take up arms for @entity6 extremist groups in the country			1
the revelation follows the news that two @entity11 men were killed fighting for @entity13 in @entity14 this past weekend			1
the @entity15 confirmed that @entity16 , 33 , who went to high school in @entity18 , died while fighting @entity20 rebels in @entity14 with the @entity21			1
a @entity18 father - of - nine , @entity22 , 29 , has been confirmed as the second @entity24 jihadi to die fighting for @entity13 in @entity14			1
the @entity32 's chief division counsel in @entity18 , @entity31 , told @entity33 that the phenomenon began in 2007 , with @entity35 - @entity24 from the state traveling to @entity37			1
' in @entity37 , it started as a nationalistic call ... [ but ] we ’ve now seen where some individuals perhaps are not interested or not inclined to travel to @entity37 , [ they ] start to branch out to other hot spots around the globe , obviously @entity14 being among them , ' @entity31 told @entity33			0
one of those initial recruits was @entity46 , a high school friend of @entity16 who died in bloody fighting in 2009			2
@entity11 's martyrs come from diverse backgrounds - some @entity50 , others @entity51 , some migrants and others born - and - raised @entity24 - but often have one thing in common : no direction			1
for those lost , disaffected youths , extremist groups offer an exciting destination to those going nowhere in life			2
the mother of @entity46 , who also knew @entity16 , said the young men were particularly susceptible			2
in an interview with the @entity66 , she described both young men as ' sort of searching			0
' ' i think both of them had a really strong desire to be needed and ( be ) of value , ' she said			0
' searching ' : @entity74 ( left ) and @entity46 ( right ) were high school friends in suburban who died five years apart as martyrs for the @entity6 terror group @entity13 @entity79 , a @entity18 community leader , concurred			1
' they are young men who are vulnerable , who have been taken advantage of because of their situation , ' @entity79 told @entity33			0
' this is a youth who has lost direction , who has no hope in life , and the only way they can find [ it ] is to find other means of living			0
' in a recruiting video aimed especially at @entity1 recorded before his death , @entity46 , a @entity97 , exhorted others to join him in @entity14			2
' this is the best place to be , honestly , ' he said , gripping a gun and grinning goofily , one of his front teeth missing			0
' i can only tell you that you have the best of dreams , you eat the best of food , and you are with the best of brothers and sisters who came here for the sake of @entity115			0
if you guys only knew how much fun we have over here			0
this is the real @entity120			0
you need to come here and join us			0
' the video , entitled @entity11 ’s martyrs : the path to @entity125 , was reportedly released by @entity127 @entity126			1
the @entity128 reports that the @entity32 's psychological analysts at @entity130 in @entity131 are heavily monitoring the activities of @entity24 citizens who have expressed extreme views online			0
vulnerable : community leaders say young , aimless @entity24 are vulnerable to recruitment by @entity6 extremist groups @entity11 martyr : @entity46 , a @entity97 , appeared in a recruiting video for @entity126 telling other @entity24 that fighting in @entity14 was ' like @entity120 ' but according to @entity141 , the director of the @entity144 and @entity145 , young women from @entity18 's @entity37 community are still being recruited to support @entity6 militants in @entity14			1
' as recently as a week ago , a young girl was recruited along some others , and was sent to @entity14 and called her family from @entity14 a couple days ago , ' he said			0
@entity11 , mainly in the @entity18 - @entity152 area , is home to the largest @entity35 community in the @entity24 , including people who fled the long civil war in their east @entity158 country and children born in the @entity24			1
many are now @entity24 citizens			0
@entity126 's initial recruitment efforts began in 2007 when small groups began discussing returning home to fight @entity164 troops who entered @entity37 to prop up a weak @entity166 - backed government and were seen by many @entity37 as foreign invaders			1
the recruiters aimed their appeal at the young men 's patriotic and religious ideals			0
even after @entity164 were expelled from @entity37 , @entity126 continued to target young men frustrated with life in the @entity174 , luring them with propaganda videos that glorify jihad and martyrdom			2
a high - quality video that began circulating last month featured what it said were three @entity18 men who were killed in @entity37			1
according to @entity181 , a security analyst with @entity183 - based @entity182 's , @entity126 has increasingly focused in the past three years on the recruitment of western nationals and members of the @entity35 diaspora in the @entity24 and @entity188 to offset its declining domestic support			1
as much of a concern as it is that young @entity24 are dying abroad for extremist groups , of even greater worry is that the recruits will return home and commit acts of terrorism on @entity24 soil .			2
