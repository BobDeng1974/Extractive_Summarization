former @entity1 captain @entity0 has branded the six @entity1 players who withdrew at short notice from saturday 's match against @entity5 a ' disgrace ' and called for them to be sacked by the club			1
@entity10 quartet @entity8 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , @entity15 @entity14 and @entity17 @entity16 all told beleaguered head coach @entity18 they were injured and could not travel to @entity19			1
@entity18 , speaking after his side lost 2 - 1 at @entity21 , described it as a ' freakish ' set of events			1
according to the manager , @entity13 had been rested since sustaining a knock but had been expected to recover , while @entity8 and @entity27 declared themselves unfit after training on thursday with the rest pulling out following a ' light ' session on friday			2
@entity18 had a depleted squad to pick from when six @entity1 players pulled out at late notice @entity8 was among the six players to withdraw from the squad ahead of the defeat by @entity5 but @entity0 was unimpressed and wants the players out of @entity39			1
' i would sack them and take the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) on , ' he said on @entity44 's @entity43			2
' i do n't think players can do that , it 's scandalous and it 's just another story for @entity1 that is disgraceful			1
he added : ' i do n't know exactly the players and it might be one or two of them have got a good excuse , but it sounds too stupid to be true			2
' striker @entity8 used @entity55 to defend himself , as did goalkeeper @entity13 who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against @entity59 on tuesday night			0
however , @entity0 questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw			1
' in the old days you used to play with anything , cuts or one thing or another , ' he said			0
' the managers had a big say in whether you were fit or not			0
you did n't just come in and say ' i 've got a headache , i 'm going home '			0
i 'm sure with @entity72 or @entity73 , i ca n't imagine what would have happened if you 'd have done that			0
' @entity11 , @entity8 and two other @entity10 were among those who made themselves unavailable the withdrawals are just the latest incident in another turbulent period at @entity1			2
@entity18 's position at @entity39 has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks , despite leading the club to championship safety after taking over from ill - fated predecessors @entity85 and @entity86			1
he saw assistant @entity87 lose his job without warning on april 2 and his own deal , which expires at the end of the season , looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club 's current regime			2
the withdrawals , including @entity14 's , are the latest incident in another turbulent period at @entity1 @entity98 president @entity97 has been banned since january after being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in @entity10 , but is due to return in a fortnight 's time			1
@entity0 , who played for @entity1 between 1972 and 1982 , was left to lament the situation at his old club			1
' it 's a club that 's a shambles and has been a shambles for 10 years , ' the @entity106 defender said			0
' we just stutter from disaster to disaster , joke to joke			0
if it was n't sickening it would be funny			0
you could n't write a book about @entity1 and what 's happened			1
' personally , i do n't know the @entity10 guy but i do n't think he realises the size of the club , it 's just a little play thing and he 's making a mess of it in my opinion			0
' @entity98 president @entity97 has been banned since january but is due to return in a fortnight 's time			0
