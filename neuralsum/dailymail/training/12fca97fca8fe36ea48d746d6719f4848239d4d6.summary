by @entity1 reporter published : 01:02 est , 18 august 2013 updated : 01:05 est , 18 august 2013 normally when the police show up it means the party 's over			1
but police officers in @entity7 have been adding to the fun this weekend by providing snacks at a marijuana festival			1
the @entity11 descended on the city ’s annual @entity12 , which celebrates marijuana culture , to put into action a plan dubbed ' @entity17			1
' dangerously cheesy : police officers at this year 's @entity19 in @entity7 will dish out bags of @entity21 with messages outlining the new marijuana laws in @entity24 police notice : @entity7 police are keen for cannabis users to understand how the new laws affect users of the drug in a move to draw attention to marijuana usage rules and restrictions in the state , officers handed out free @entity21 with stickers about pot laws stuck on the bags			1
each bag displayed a sticker of do ’s and don’ts of @entity44 , @entity24 ’s ballot measure that legalized the possession of marijuana in november			1
however , it the festival goers already came with the munchiues as @entity7 police found themselves running out of their stash of chips within 10 minutes of dolling them out			1
the stickers instructed @entity54 to remember to avoid driving while high , giving or selling weed to people under the age of 21 , as well as forgoing pot use in public			0
cat - snack : one of the lucky festival goers who managed to grab a bag of the chips and who will of course be now far better informed about the new rules lining up the chips : @entity68 of the @entity69 hands out the munchies to attendees of @entity12 @entity11 's spokesman , sergeant @entity72 , said the department wanted to use the opportunity to spread the word about new marijuana laws , by attaching a summarized version to bags of @entity21			1
the law came into effect in 2012 , and allows anyone to legally possess up to an ounce of recreational marijuana			1
but police are worried people still are n't clear enough on the rules			1
' distributing salty snacks at a festival celebrating hemp , i think , is deliberately ironic enough that people will accept them in good humor , ' @entity94			2
' we want to make sure people learn the rules and that they respect the vote			2
' the @entity11 has composed its own guide to the law , ' marijwhatnow ? '			1
“ when the laws changed , there was a little bit of an informational vacuum about how police would react , ” @entity72 told @entity101			2
' @entity107 ' clearly states that @entity7 police will not arrest anyone for possessing under an ounce of marijuana , but also outlines the rules that do still exist in the state , and at federal level			1
delivery : police were on scene at 10am on saturday morning ready to dish out the @entity21 complete with informative sticker explaining the new laws all out : @entity11 announced that they had run out of @entity21 's on their twitter feed in a humorous way @entity12 is an annual @entity7 event where marijuana enthusiasts gather in protest of strict cannabis laws			1
more than 200,000 people are attending this weekend a thousand bags of cheesy @entity21 were handed out			1
@entity7 's @entity12 is the largest gathering advocating cannabis decriminalization in the world			1
it takes place over two miles of @entity7 parks this weekend			0
sergeant @entity72 was also a due to speak at the three - day event			0
' we wanted to do something in a fun way that said , ' look this is cool and everything but the rules are the rules ' he said			2
can i legally carry around an ounce of marijuana ? according to the recently passed initiative , beginning december 6th , adults over the age of 21 will be able to carry up to an ounce of marijuana for personal use			2
please note that the initiative says it “ is unlawful to open a package containing marijuana … in view of the general public , ” so there ’s that			2
also , you probably should n’t bring pot with you to the federal courthouse ( or any other federal property )			0
where can i legally buy pot , then ? the @entity159 is working to establish guidelines for the sale and distribution of marijuana			2
the @entity159 has until december 1 , 2013 to finalize those rules			1
in the meantime , production and distribution of non-medical marijuana remains illegal			2
can i grow marijuana in my home and sell it to my friends , family , and co-workers ? not right now			2
in the future , under state law , you may be able to get a license to grow or sell marijuana			2
can i smoke pot outside my home ? like at a park , magic show , or the @entity182 ? much like having an open container of alcohol in public , doing so could result in a civil infraction — like a ticket — but not arrest			0
you can certainly use marijuana in the privacy of your own home			0
additionally , if smoking a cigarette is n’t allowed where you are ( say , inside an apartment building or flammable chemical factory ) , smoking marijuana is n’t allowed there either			0
will police officers be able to smoke marijuana ? as of right now , no. this is still a very complicated issue			0
if i apply for a job at the @entity11 , will past ( or current ) marijuana use be held against me ? the current standard for applicants is that they have not used marijuana in the previous three years			1
in light of @entity44 , the department will consult with the @entity210 and the state attorney general to see if and how that standard may be revised			0
what happens if i get pulled over and an officer thinks i ’ve been smoking pot ? if an officer believes you ’re driving under the influence of anything , they will conduct a field sobriety test and may consult with a drug recognition expert			0
if officers establish probable cause , they will bring you to a precinct and ask your permission to draw your blood for testing			0
if officers have reason to believe you ’re under the influence of something , they can get a warrant for a blood draw from a judge			0
if you ’re in a serious accident , then a blood draw will be mandatory			0
the @entity11 seized a bunch of my marijuana before @entity44 passed			1
can i have it back ? no. will @entity11 assist federal law enforcement in investigations of marijuana users or marijuana - related businesses , that are allowed under @entity44 ? no. officers and detectives will not participate in an investigation of anything that ’s not prohibited by state law			1
december 6th seems like a really long ways away			0
what happens if i get caught with marijuana before then ? hold your breath			0
your case will be processed under current state law			0
however , there is already a city ordinance making marijuana enforcement the lowest law enforcement priority			0
what happens if i get caught smoking pot ? it ’s a violation of state law			0
it may referred to prosecutors , just like if you were a minor in possession of alcohol .			0

@entity11 to hand out bags of @entity21 with marijuana laws stuck to them in bid to *clarify* rules
@entity276 2013 , the world 's largest marijuana festival , draws more than 200,000 cannabis enthusiasts
