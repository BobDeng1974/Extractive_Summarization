by @entity0 published : 04:01 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 04:52 est , 18 september 2013 angry parents have criticised a @entity3 fashion chain selling sexy pvc - look clubwear for girls as young as eight			1
@entity8 - based @entity7 is offering shiny crop tops and leggings , lace crop tops and skintight leopard - print dresses to girls aged eight to 13			1
today mothers and children 's campaigners condemned the chain , which has 114 stores across the @entity3 and a website , as ' so wrong '			1
suitable for an eight - year - old ? fashion chain @entity7 is selling these sexy crop tops to young children the clubbing - type clothes were spotted by mother @entity24 , 35 , of @entity26 , @entity27 as she browsed through the @entity29 range of clothes for children at her local branch			1
' if i saw an eight - year - old in that stuff i 'd wonder what the parents were thinking			2
it 's essentially sexy clubwear with a label that says " age eight " , she told the @entity42 ' @entity46 mother - of - two @entity43 , 34 , founder of @entity45 , said : ' children should n’t be encouraged to dress in anything that could be perceived as sexy or revealing			2
' for their own self esteem i think it is crucial that girls are n’t exposed to the idea of dressing to impress others - and certainly not be pressurised to look alluring			0
' and @entity55 , founder of @entity56 , said : ' eight - year - olds girls should be enjoying the innocence of childhood , not being dressed up to look like a lapdancer			0
' the manufacturers may try to justify @entity63 style crop tops and see through lace leggings as harmless fashion and claim children want the styles , but children do n't realise the implications of wearing such unsuitable clothes			1
' young shoppers at @entity7 are offered a skintight leopard - print skintight minidress or short black skirt she added : ' every few months we hear promises from retailers that they will clean up their act and only sell age appropriate clothes - but we keep on seeing more examples			1
' it 's down to parents to reject them			0
do n't buy them , and the sellers will have to stop			0
' @entity86 , @entity87 founder , said : ' it 's not about prudishness or hankering after a rose - tinted picture of childhood , it 's about parents knowing in their bones that there 's something wrong with a society that puts pressure on girls as young as eight to dress up like pole dancers			2
' @entity87 founder @entity86 , seen with her children , said children should not be dressed ' as pole dancers ' @entity104 , of the @entity106 charity , said the fashion chain had gone against recommendations made in the 2011 @entity109 into the pressures on and sexualisation of children			1
she said : ' i think this crosses the line , particularly the crop tops which are shown on the websites with a bust - eight - year - old girls do n't have a bust , and while it might be ok for a 15 - year - old , it is not ok for an eight - year - old and the retailers should have considered that			1
' it is not age appropriate at all			0
' @entity127 did not respond to @entity129 's request for a comment today			0
three years ago @entity131 was slammed for selling padded bikinis to girls as young as seven			0
a national outcry ensued when it emerged that it was selling the padded underwear to infants in primary school that culminated in prime minister @entity138 denouncing the sale as ' disgraceful '			0
@entity131 then abandoned the sale of the tops in april 2010			0
the following year @entity142 came under fire for selling padded bras to girls as young as eight			0
the pink gingham bras were padded to give the illusion of a bust and were sold on @entity142 's website under the heading ' @entity150 - 13yrs '			2
the fashion chain promised an immediate review of its lines for girls following criticism and said it was committed to only selling clothes that were age - appropriate .			1

@entity8 - based @entity7 sells ' *suggestive* ' clothing in ' @entity29 ' range
pvc - look crop tops , leggings , and skintight dresses all on offer to children
mothers condemned the fashion chain 's *decision* to sell them as ' so wrong '
