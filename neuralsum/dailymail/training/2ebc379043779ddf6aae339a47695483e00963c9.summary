a @entity1 woman who racked up credit card debt of nearly $ 200,000 , but was still able to turn her life around , has given her advice on how to bounce back from financial ruin			1
originally from @entity7 , @entity6 racked up $ 100,000 on credit cards in her homeland before coming to @entity10 15 years ago and adding $ 85,000 of debt to that			1
‘ i was only earning $ 50,000 per year , but was completely out of control with money and was a chronic over-spender on credit cards , ’ she explained			1
it was a drastic situation			2
‘ i was doing office work and administrative roles which were really beneath my capabilities , but this was my basic problem – i totally undervalued myself despite having a university education			2
i ’d absolutely no sense of self - worth			1
’ scaling down her spending and being more realistic put @entity34 back on the road to redemption because of her self - esteem issues and the stress the debt was putting her under ; @entity34 would spend to make herself feel better			1
of course , this just worsened the situation and sent her life flying into a downward spiral			2
she ’d splash out on luxury holidays to the likes of @entity47 and @entity48 , while if she stayed in @entity10 she would holiday in the likes of @entity50 and book into the plushest hotel there			1
there were expensive spa treatments , extravagant nights out in trendy restaurants , lavish gifts for herself and her friends – the spending was never - ending			1
but none of it made her feel better			2
because of the shame she felt over her continuing debt she put on a front of being successful and wealthy when she was anything but that			1
‘ i was filled with so much fear and self - loathing			1
i ’d spend all this money to compensate for my lack of self - worth , ’ @entity68 said			1
‘ i was feeling desperate and out of control			0
but after unburdening myself to a friend and admitting i had a problem , i vowed to turn my life around			0
’ because of the shame she felt over her continuing debt @entity34 put on a front of being successful and wealthy @entity34 sat down and made up a plan			1
after educating herself on financial strategies and techniques to change her mindset with money , she more than tripled her income in the space of a year by working in better jobs			1
it then took a few years to get her credit rating back to normal			0
she did this by using only cash and direct debit			0
because of all she ’d experienced , @entity34 went into financial coaching to help other women who were suffering with money problems			1
after being told she ’d have to declare bankruptcy , in four years , she paid off all the debt			1
she now helps women redefine their relationship with money , which is the most common roadblock to long - term financial freedom			1
@entity34 believes we live in a society where we 're all encouraged to overspend and live the highlife ‘ i have five basic tips about how to turn around your money problems , ” @entity68 said			2
‘ firstly , pre-plan when you 're going to do your shopping and stick to that schedule			0
avoid the shops when you 're stressed , overtired or hungry			0
‘ apply the three @entity114 strategy : @entity115 , @entity116 , delay - decide to walk away , distract yourself with another activity or delay the urge - give it 24 hours and sleep on it			2
‘ set a spending plan and shopping list and stick to it			0
‘ use cash and direct debit rather than credit			0
when buying gifts carry cash in an envelope with the person 's name on it and only spend what 's in the envelope for that person			0
‘ finally , be mindful of what you are spending money on over the holidays , tally up your spending at the end of each week so that you are aware of where your money is going			2
put stop gaps in place where necessary			0
’ she believed the tips were even more essential now as we come up to @entity147 and the holiday period , especially for women			0
@entity34 always had lavish holidays to @entity47 and @entity48 despite her secret financial woes ‘ it ’s so loaded with expectation			1
there ’s so much pressure to go out and spend a lot of money around the holidays , ’ @entity68 said			2
the annual @entity156 in @entity10 survey 2014 conducted by the @entity157 ( @entity157 ) released on tuesday has found 53 % of @entity10 women say personal finances are a major source of stress			1
‘ a lot of women are dealing with low wages and overspending			0
it is a vicious circle because you get so down about the debt you ’re in ; you spend to make yourself feel better			2
you have to take responsibility for your situation and plan ahead , ’ she said			0
@entity34 also believed banks and retailers were also a big part of the problem			0
‘ we live in a society where you are encouraged to overspend			0
despite the fact i was only earning $ 50,000 per year , these banks still gave me a $ 10,000 credit limit , which was an exorbitant amount			1
it was one fifth of my salary			0
yet they continued to extend my credit willingly , ’ she said			0
eventually @entity34 got her credit rating back to normal by using only cash and direct debit @entity34 has already launched www.alicecrawley.com and has a rapidly growing community presence and following across @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191			0
she has released 12 free episodes of @entity193 , inspiring women to find their own way out of the rabbit hole of debt			2
while in february 2015 , she will be launching her first online program ‘ @entity199 ’ .			0
