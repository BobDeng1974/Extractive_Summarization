few athletes enjoy discussing injuries or ailments but for @entity4 the subject is still preferable to getting dragged into the debate on @entity7 independence			1
after easing his way into the third round of the @entity11 he was far more comfortable talking about how he has upped his intake of salt to combat cramp than he was the future of the @entity15			1
he swerved the referendum issue as adroitly as he did the threat of @entity20 ’s @entity19 , who he defeated 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 to set up a meeting this evening with world no 96 @entity23 of @entity25			1
this involves raiding the player canteen at @entity30 for the dinky little packets of seasoning that most use purely to add some flavour to their pasta			2
‘ i have changed a few things , not so much what i ’m eating but what i ’m drinking			0
i ’m making sure i have enough fluids down me and take a bit more salt to see if that helps , ’ he said			2
‘ there are little one - gram sachets of salt in the restaurant i take			1
the conditions are tough and you need to make sure you are on top of everything before matches so you do n’t get caught out			0
‘ i do n’t weigh food but i weigh myself three times a day — when i get up , normally after practice , and before i go to bed			0
i know exactly what my weight should be in the morning and in the evening			0
’ from @entity25 with love : @entity83 96 @entity23 faces the former @entity85 champion in the next round @entity87 : @entity15 fans get behind @entity4 during his third round match against @entity19 @entity91 quarter - final @entity92 semi-final wimbledon quarter - final @entity11 ? evidently that was all part of the review of what happened against in his first - round struggle against @entity38			1
‘ there were no fluctuations earlier in the week in terms of my weight			0
i had drunk enough in terms of quantity but maybe something was missing			0
i will make sure i am on top of it for the rest of the tournament			0
’ the soaring temperatures of the past week — which have seen several players go down with cramp — have now abated and a mild few days are expected as the 2012 champion tries to get past the @entity25 , who upset @entity117 ’s formidable @entity116 in five sets			0
@entity23 is a dangerous , flat hitter who after beating @entity15 ’s @entity119 at @entity85 — a year ago today @entity119 came close to beating @entity120 to make the last 16 here — went on to make the fourth round at @entity123 to do that he also had to beat the ultra-tough @entity124 , so he is not to be underestimated			1
the 23 - year - old is coached by his father and in his spare time likes to drive bmws and play the guitar			1
love game : @entity4 's girlfriend @entity131 watches the action under the @entity31 heat girl power : the @entity135 trains with female coach @entity136 as he bids to win a first tournament this year same again ? @entity4 is hoping to repeat the success he had in winning the 2012 @entity11 five years ago he won @entity85 and a swift ascent was predicted but , as for so many others at that age , it did not work out that way			1
‘ it was pretty hard , i had some bad periods , ’ he said			0
‘ in the beginning it seemed to be easy that i was going to go to top 100 but i lost some matches			0
finally i came to top 100 two years ago , the first time , and then i came to top 100 again this year			2
i did a lot of work , and now i hope to stay there			0
cramps can occur at any time but little is known about their precise causes , partly because they can appear out of the blue			2
sometimes underlying health issues such as liver disease can lead to muscle cramps , but for top athletes — some of the fittest people on the planet — cramp can be something of a mystery			1
it was a widely - held belief that being dehydrated , and therefore having lower levels of salt in your body , could lead to your muscles involuntarily contracting			1
though there is little clinical evidence for this , some athletes try to minimise the effects by taking on extra fluids and nutrients			2
what works for some may not work for others , but clearly @entity4 feels snacking on salt reduces the risk			1
‘ i can be aggressive against @entity4 , there is much less pressure on me than him			2
’ @entity4 looked much more comfortable against @entity19 and will not be unhappy if the conditions are windy again , as he showed that there is nobody more skilful than him when it is blowing			1
looking further ahead , expectations should not be placed too high as @entity191 , his prospective quarter - final opponent , looks like he has already played himself back into form			1
danger ahead ! @entity191 is @entity4 's potential opponent should they both reach the quarter - finals keeping schtum : @entity4 would prefer not to get involved in the issue of @entity7 independence nice touch in the players ’ lounge where competitors are signing a giant get - well card for @entity206 - @entity205 teenager @entity204 , who last year beat former champion @entity207 here			1
@entity208 is being treated for @entity210 ’s lymphoma			0
unsurprisingly , one of the signatures is that of @entity28 , himself a cancer survivor			0
more bizarre @entity11 scheduling yesterday with many of the best daytime matches being put on the @entity217 , the third largest arena			2
the likes of @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 were better than the flat fare served up on @entity225			0
equally hard to avoid is the independence issue , but again he wanted to tiptoe around the subject while being keen to emphasise that he is taking a keen interest			1
knowing all too well of the abuse he would take from either side — getting tired , old accusations of @entity232 on one hand or being attacked by the @entity234 on the other — he has taken the easier option and hid behind the fact that , as a long - time @entity241 resident , he can not vote anyway			2
a shame in many ways , as he is an original thinker and his full view would doubtless be interesting			0
it ’s not too late to play @entity247 … there ’s £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager click here to start picking your fantasy football team now ! there ’s £ 60,000 in prizes including £ 1,000 up for grabs every week …			0
