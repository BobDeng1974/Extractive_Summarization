@entity0 has been a bit hit and miss this season , but he was outstanding against @entity3			1
he scored twice — the perfect present on his 30th birthday — and was at the heart of an @entity8 performance that was a joy to watch			2
for his first goal he took an excellent touch , rode a challenge and then hit a delightful chip into the corner			2
it would have been very easy for him to go down in the area , but he stayed on his feet and was rewarded with a goal			1
@entity0 did n't go down to score the first of his two goals against @entity3 on saturday the @entity20 also scored a cheeky ' @entity22 ' penalty to seal @entity8 's 4 - 1 victory at the @entity24 @entity26 wheels away to celebrate his goal in a victory that had @entity29 singing @entity31 's name @entity32 ( left ) is congratulated by @entity33 after also scoring twice against the @entity34 that was good to see on a day where too many players were diving , including @entity39 ’s @entity38 , who took a theatrical tumble			1
@entity41 the diving this weekend was bad but another problem is the high foot			2
last week @entity45 was booked for an ugly high lunge and @entity47 was lucky not to be sent off for catching @entity48 on saturday			2
it ’s a worry because it ’s the kind of challenge that can cause serious damage			0
@entity39 ’s @entity38 ( left ) was one of several players taking theatrical dives at the weekend @entity47 's ( right ) high footed challenge on @entity48 deserved to be shown a red card @entity56 is at it again @entity58 must have an invisibility cloak			1
that ’s the only reason i can think of to explain why so many teams still let him make those late runs into the area to score			1
@entity58 has hit plenty of 30 - yard screamers in his time , but if you had to describe his winner for @entity71 at @entity72 , you ’d have to say : ‘ oh , just the usual			1
’ @entity58 steals in to score @entity71 's match winning goal against @entity72 on saturday despite scoring as many @entity77 goals as @entity78 , opponents still struggle to pick up @entity58 @entity71 's win keeps the pressure up on @entity58 's former club @entity81 at the top of the table arriving late in the box is his trademark , but still teams let him do it			1
when he is in the final third you have to mark him because if you do n’t , he will punish you			0
@entity89 is so experienced but the way he let @entity58 in made me wonder if he ’d ever seen him play before			1
at this level , attention to detail is everything and you can not afford to let a player like him have five yards of space in a crowded area			0
he even pointed to where he wanted the ball ! it ’s such an obvious weapon , but @entity72 did n’t do enough to try to stop it			0
ps it seems @entity71 will have ‘ discussions ’ with @entity106 about extending @entity58 ’s stay			1
considering @entity71 own the @entity106 club , it wo n’t exactly be a tricky conversation ... city : @entity58 ’s doing well , is n’t he ... mind if we keep him a bit longer ? @entity106 : well , you do actually own us , so in a way he ’s your player ... city : of course he is ! pleasure doing business with you ! @entity121 @entity122 has had his critics in the past but he made an excellent save against @entity124 on saturday night and is impressing me			1
he came on to our @entity127 panel show , @entity129 , last week and he struck me as a really nice young man			0
he was game for a laugh , got stuck in and at 24 is mature beyond his years			0
@entity122 celebrates @entity8 's victory , which included an exceptional save against @entity124 the @entity135 1 's skills between the sticks are more impressive than his singing voice the @entity138 could go on to rival @entity139 ( centre ) as arguably @entity8 's greatest ever keeper @entity139 was nearly 27 by the time he arrived at @entity8 and is arguably the club ’s greatest goalkeeper			1
@entity122 has a long way to go to match that , but he has a bright future			1
the only downside was his singing			0
he had to do a duet with @entity150			0
it ’s a good job his goalkeeping is better than his singing ! @entity153 hit back @entity153 bounced back from defeat at @entity155 with an excellent result against @entity157			1
@entity158 puts his hands behind his ears after scoring the winner for @entity153 against @entity157 @entity153 have picked up almost a point a game on average , which would ultimately see them earn survival @entity166 has seen @entity157 slump after a better than expected start to his @entity77 campaign in the past 10 years , teams have needed an average of around 37 points to stay up — that ’s about a point per game			1
so @entity153 will be pleased with 15 points from 16 games , all things considered			1
for @entity157 it was disappointing , but that shows how well they have done under @entity166			0
expectations are perhaps too high because they are doing brilliantly			0
1997 - @entity182 was something of a penalty specialist at @entity185 , with 11 scored over two seasons			0
but the @entity187 missed the chance to give @entity157 the lead from the spot at @entity153 on saturday			1
the last time @entity157 missed a @entity77 penalty was way back in april 1997 , when @entity192 missed against @entity193			2
83.3 % - @entity194 has scored five goals from just six efforts on target this season			0
that puts his conversion rate at an impressive 83.3 per cent			0
4th - @entity0 became the fourth @entity8 player to score on his birthday after @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205			1
92 - it only took @entity207 92 seconds to equalise at @entity208 on saturday			2
after @entity210 hit the opener for the home side , @entity209 replied just over a minute and a half later for the visitors			0
3 - @entity215 's red card at @entity216 means he has now been sent off in three straight seasons			2
he previously went seven seasons without a red			0
63.3 % - @entity208 completed just 63.3 per cent of their passes against @entity207			0
only 10 times this season have teams completed less than 65 per cent — on five occasions it was @entity208			2
2 - it was not a good day for @entity228 ’s @entity227			0
his red card after 22 minutes was the second fastest this season after @entity231 ’s against @entity207			0
also , his two @entity77 red cards have come against his old clubs — @entity39 and @entity234 .			2

@entity0 stayed on his feet to score against @entity3 on saturday
@entity238 , @entity239 and @entity38 were *guilty* of diving
teams still struggle to pick up @entity58 's trademark late runs
@entity122 is a far better goalkeeper than he is a singer
@entity153 are on course to stay in the @entity77 after a slow start
