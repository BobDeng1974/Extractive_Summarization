@entity0 have now lost five matches on the bounce and @entity4 's men are coming under pressure to get a result against @entity7			1
consecutive defeats to @entity9 and @entity10 have left the @entity11 wounded after two november internationals			1
here , @entity14 's @entity13 analyses where @entity0 have failed to match their southern - hemisphere rivals in the autumn internationals			1
@entity0 captain @entity18 looked devastated after the final whistle as @entity0 were beaten again carry on carrying only @entity10 have made fewer carries than @entity0 , who desperately need to add ballast to a back row short of carriers			1
@entity25 is the clear favourite to return to add a threat with the ball			0
carries per game : @entity30 150 , @entity9 130 , @entity0 102 , @entity10 100			1
@entity25 ( centre ) is a clear favourite to return to the @entity0 side in order to improve their carrying no driving ambition @entity0 have made fewer metres than any of the southern - hemisphere powers			2
they are not explosive enough through contact , while the passing in the threequarters is not putting players into space			0
metres per game : @entity9 552.3 , @entity30 475.3 , @entity10 296.0 , @entity0 292.5			1
@entity0 have made fewer metres this autumn then any of the southern - hemisphere sides take a break @entity10 - who lost to @entity49 , do n’t forget - have made fewer breaks but they base their game on relentless surging power			1
@entity0 are establishing set - piece dominance but lack the nous and creativity to make space for their dangerous runners			2
@entity58 breaks per game : @entity9 11.3 , @entity30 6.3 , @entity0 5.0 , @entity10 3.5			1
@entity0 are lacking nous and creativity and need to turn to someone like @entity63 passing the buck you ca n’t generate a stat for the quality of passing but it ’s clear @entity0 ’s has been poor			2
a strong rugby league influence seems to favour end - over - end style which has a less predictable trajectory than old - fashioned spin pass			0
@entity74 is the most sympathetic distributor in the country and @entity0 are missing his passing game			2
@entity74 ( right ) is the most sympathetic distributor in @entity0 but is not even in the squad who turned off the power ? without powerful centres @entity82 and @entity84 , @entity0 simply fail to go route one in the midfield			0
@entity0 are not powerful enough to blast through tackles so need to use quick feet and better spatial awareness to put players through gaps			0
at the moment they ’re doing neither			0
defenders beaten per game : @entity9 25.8 , @entity30 20.5 , @entity0 19.0 @entity10 13.5			1
@entity0 are missing the power of someone like @entity82 in the middle of the park right now a load of trouble just four offloads in two matches is a paltry return			0
the start of @entity4 ’s tenure saw @entity0 commit defenders but move the point of attack from breakdown with two quick passes			2
a lack of offloads indicates a lack of confidence in support runners and lack of footballing ability			0
@entity9 are light years ahead in this department			0
offloads per game : @entity9 17.5 , @entity30 9.3 , @entity10 5.5 , @entity0 4.0			1
@entity10 came out on top 31 - 28 at @entity121 on saturday to inflict another defeat on @entity0 it ’s turning bad @entity0 are way behind @entity9 and @entity10 at scavenging on the floor			1
the country that produced @entity126 and @entity127 seems to have forgotten the role of a proper no 7			0
@entity18 is an outstanding back - row player but is more suited to no 6			0
it ’s telling his opposite man has won man - of - the - match awards in both games as @entity0 have lost the breakdown battle			2
@entity135 won per game : @entity10 9.0 , @entity9 7.8 , @entity0 5.5 , @entity30 4.0			1
@entity18 is a great player but should be at @entity137 because @entity0 are lacking a scavenger			0

@entity0 have lost to both @entity9 and @entity10 this autumn
@entity4 's men have now lost five games on the bounce
