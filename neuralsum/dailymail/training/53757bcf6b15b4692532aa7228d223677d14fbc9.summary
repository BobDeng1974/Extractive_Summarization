the party is holding what is billed as its ' biggest ever ' conference at @entity16 tomorrow – with mr @entity0 set to give his set - piece address			1
but the party has been left infuriated after mr @entity2 announced that @entity3 would be recalled to allow mps to vote on plans to start bombing @entity11			1
but @entity1 @entity6 – including the leader @entity0 - suggested the recall was a cynical ploy to take attention away from his party 's conference , which is being held in @entity16 tomorrow and saturday			1
@entity6 @entity1 accused @entity2 of a ' cynical ploy ' to divert attention away from @entity1 's conference			1
she said : ' i think i 've been in politics long enough now to know that you have to be a little bit cynical , i 'm afraid			0
' what happened the day after @entity34 defected ? the threat level , the security threat level to @entity36 was raised			0
' and i think @entity38 hit the nail on the head there , that the threat level had actually been raised from @entity43 to @entity44			0
' and now , on the day the @entity1 party conference starts , he does something that actually several people had been calling for him to do for weeks : recall @entity3 to try and sort out the problem of this barbaric death cult in @entity51 and @entity52			1
' she added : ' i think this is a cynical ploy , i 'm afraid			2
' fellow mep @entity55 wrote on @entity56 : ' just fancy that - @entity57 may recall parly on 1st day of @entity1 conference to announce that he has finally worked out which side to bomb in @entity52			1
' @entity61 , the party 's 2015 candidate for @entity63 , said @entity2 was ' scared ' of what leader @entity0 might say on friday at the @entity1 conference			1
it came after mr @entity0 said : ' it is widely believed prime minister @entity2 held back on recalling @entity3 on an issue of massive national importance so it did n't affect the @entity71 conference , which finished today			1
' however , he still thought it best to delay parliamentary recall until friday , and not do it tomorrow			2
' the party is believed to be considering moving mr @entity0 's keynote speech to 11am on friday to avoid a clash with the potential parliamentary debate			0
but the former defence secretary @entity78 said the claim was ' preposterous '			0
he said : ' i 'm in @entity81 at the moment and all eyes are on @entity11 and the @entity84			0
does he think the @entity85 are trying to take attention off @entity1 too ? ' the government are hugely focused on this , all the world is concerned about it			0
' it really is a sign of total loss of perspective if @entity0 believes this is to do with a minor party 's conference			1
good he 's not in @entity110 making the calls			0
' @entity112 , @entity113 mp for @entity114 , wrote : ' @entity1 tinfoil hat brigade think international military action is deliberately times to disrupt their conference			2
they really are a joke			0
' and communities minister @entity121 said : ' @entity0 really does think the world revolves around him			2
' mr @entity2 returned from @entity124 overnight to hold a @entity125 this afternoon			0
the visit has been in the diary for weeks and it was always clear that @entity128 would not be needed to sanction action until after then			0
