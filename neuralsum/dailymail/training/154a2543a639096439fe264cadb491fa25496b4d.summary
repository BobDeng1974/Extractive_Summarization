@entity1 natural : @entity2 sometimes showers as infrequently as twice a week a girlfriend kept me waiting for coffee the other morning , eventually bustling into the cafe trailing a cloud of expensive - smelling body lotion and damp apple - scented hair , gushing apologies she 'd had to ' jump in the shower ' before she could leave the house			1
sipping my lukewarm cappuccino , i resisted the urge to confide i had n't had a shower for three days , and my blow - dry was a week old			1
if she was to sniff my hair she 'd smell - well , my hair			1
confessing i do n't shower every day - in fact , why do n't i admit that sometimes i can shower as infrequently as twice a week - feels like i 'm breaking one of the last great taboos			1
perhaps this is because daily , and even twice - daily showers , have become the norm for many			1
smelling perfumed all over is seen as the ultimate expression of feminine allure			0
this , in my opinion , is a load of smelly hog - wash , because if you met me , you 'd never guess i 'm one of the great unwashed			1
i do n't stink , people do n't back away , handkerchief to nose when i walk in the room and neither do i look grubby			1
my hair always looks healthy and glossy and my skin crystal - clear , but a daily shower is n't something i slavishly factor into my morning ritual , even though i have many girlfriends who rise an hour before their family to scrub , blow - dry and chemically spritz themselves to a state of fragranced perfection			1
while you might raise your nose in disgust at the thought of sharing airspace with such an unashamed soap dodger , the dirty truth is i 'm not alone			0
a whopping 41 per cent of men and 33 per cent of women do n't shower daily , according to a survey this week by tissue manufacturer @entity54 , while 12 per cent have a proper scrub only twice a week			1
all of which is music to my less - than - squeaky - clean ears			0
i 'm not an advocate of dirt , but there 's a difference between keeping clean and covering yourself in gallons of water and products every day			1
sometimes a good old - fashioned , stand - up sink wash is all you need to maintain basic standards of hygiene , and you 'd be surprised how long you can go between hair washes if you put your mind to it			1
every night i brush my hair with a natural bristle brush which removes the concentration of natural oil from the roots , where it tends to gather and make hair look greasy			2
i 've also discovered that when i 'm not exercising , if i simply splash water under my arms , i seem to produce less sweat than when i spray myself with endless antiperspirants			0
so , yes , some days i do n't put any deodorant on at all			2
it took a bit of courage to try at first , but it really works			0
i noticed our obsession with feminine cleanliness in boots			0
gone are the days when a bar of @entity96 soap and bottle of @entity98 counted as a passable cleansing regime , as it did for my mother 's generation			2
i found myself assaulted by thousands of fragranced cleansers , gels and lotions designed to rid my body of the suggestion it was anything other than a perfumed , polished temple of loveliness			0
women spend millions of pounds trying to get rid of - or at best mask - our natural aromas , as if being human and female is somehow dirty			0
from foot deodorisers and mouthwashes to ' intimate wipes ' , there is no part of our body allowed to smell as nature intended			0
who knows the financial cost of all this preening			0
but the price to the planet is high , with the average person estimated to use 150 litres of water every day			0
i started cutting back on showers a year ago when i noticed my skin feeling dry after bathing			1
initially , i compensated by slapping on moisturiser , but the problem only got worse			0
soap dodgers : both @entity136 and @entity137 are said to prefer using dry , rather than liquid , shampoo i now know some dermatologists believe daily cleansing with hot water and chemical - rich soaps , rather than nourishing the skin , strips it of the essential oils that keep it soft			1
without daily showers , my skin began to feel more supple , and my hair - which i now washed no more than twice a week - looked better than it had done in years			1
i 'd been washing it every day since i was a teenager in the @entity153			0
i blame @entity154 , which hit the market as i hit adolescence			0
with its combined cleanser and conditioner , it was so quick and easy to use it encouraged a generation to wash their hair daily			1
little did i know that by doing this i 'd also been depleting my hair 's natural sebum - the oil our scalps secrete to fight bacteria - and it reacted by producing more of it			1
the result ? a frustrating cycle of greasy hair however often i washed it			2
it was n't until a camping trip last summer that my husband noticed my hair looked fresher and sexier now it was being washed less			1
' without daily showers , my skin began to feel more supple , and my hair - which i now washed no more than twice a week - looked better than it had done in years			1
' i decided to carry on with this approach once we got home and have saved a fortune on shampoo			1
it was then a natural progression to cut out some showers altogether			1
i spend the time i 've gained every morning doing something i enjoy , like wallowing in bed			2
according to @entity193 , professor of sociology at @entity195 , daily showering is a modern obsession			0
she points out that showers were only fitted into @entity199 bathrooms in significant numbers in the @entity201			2
prior to that , in most households bathtime came once a week			0
' it 's amazing how quickly daily showering became normal , even though it is n't about getting clean , because it takes more than 24 hours for dirt to accumulate , ' she says			1
' instead , the daily shower has shifted in meaning from cleanliness to freshness and invigoration , so that showering 's now a part of waking up rather than actually getting clean			2
' more worryingly , the water and products we slather ourselves with might be doing harm , she says			0
alternative health practitioner @entity221 says : ' water in cities is packed with chemicals , and hard water is harsh on the skin			2
' combine that with many of the chemical - heavy “ cleansing products ” on the market , and your daily shower could represent a toxic attack on the natural structure of your skin			2
' @entity221 believes excessive showering and exfoliation could be linked to the apparent rise in sensitive skin conditions such as psoriasis			2
in hot water : 41 % of men and 33 % of women have revealed they do n't shower daily , while 12 % have a proper scrub only twice a week ' the chemicals in water and cleansing products are relatively harmless used alone , but we do n't understand their effects on health and wellbeing when they react with one another , ' she says			2
it 's even more sinister to learn researchers at the @entity257 have raised concerns about a possible link between parabens , the chemicals used as preservatives in many shampoos and cleansers , and breast cancer			2
@entity266 , of @entity267 , which educates people on environmental issues affecting their daily life , says : ' parabens mimic human hormones , specifically oestrogen			0
considering some breast cancers are tied to oestrogen exposure , it 's advisable to avoid oestrogen - mimicking chemicals in cosmetics			2
' but my decision to ditch my daily shower is n't just about saving time , money and natural resources			1
i prefer being slightly unwashed			0
my skin looks tighter , and my thick and often unmanageable hair behaves better			1
i even skipped a wash on my wedding day last year , since squeaky clean hair is impossibly slippery to put up			1
i felt sexier and more myself			0
@entity288 also played a huge role in my initial attraction to my husband			0
i find the fresh scent of a real man far more attractive than the most expensive aftershave			0
i 'd far rather snuggle up to him when he smells of himself , rather than of chemical cleansers , and he says the same about me			0
and let 's not forget bed - head hair is considered sexy			1
@entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , and @entity302 - none of these sirens have super-groomed glossy hair			0
perhaps , like me , they are happy in their own skin			0
that 's why i wo n't be going back to washing every day			1
in an over-processed world , i believe it 's good to be a little bit human .			0

like prince @entity136 , @entity313 does n't wash her hair very often
she 's saved a fortune on shampoo , and decided to cut out some showers
she now has more free time and healthier skin and hair
