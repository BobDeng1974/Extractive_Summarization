she is at risk of a potentially deadly infection because of the sores
her body is covered in scabs and sores and she can not play with her friends at school for fear she will do more damage to her fragile skin
her toes are fusing together because they have blistered and then *re-healed* so many times - she will need surgery to separate them
her mouth also blisters so she has to stick to a soft food diet
her parents spend an hour and a half a day changing her bandages
