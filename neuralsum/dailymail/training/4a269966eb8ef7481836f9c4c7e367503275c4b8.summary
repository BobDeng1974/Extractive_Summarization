by @entity0 published : 08:51 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 13:36 est , 15 november 2013 with her wrinkle - free skin , glossy dark mane and mega-watt smile , @entity5 , 54 , certainly is n't your average grandmother			1
now the @entity9 former model and @entity11 lookalike has been crowned the @entity13 's most glamorous grandparent and credits her success to being celibate for more than 10 years			1
but although remaining single has kept her looking young , divorcee @entity5 , who claims she used to be an ' ugly duckling ' , revealed that she is searching for love			1
glamorous : @entity5 , pictured with her daughter and granddaughter , is the @entity13 's most glamorous granny beauty queens : @entity5 's 25 - year - old daughter @entity21 has also triumphed in beauty pageants ' i was married in 1984 but then divorced by 1988 and have been single for most of my adult life , ' she revealed			1
' men are not top of my list but it would be nice to have a man on my arm to take me to these events , i have got so many nice clothes to wear			1
' i think it has proved that looking good is not always good			2
i do n't know what it is , maybe men have never known how to approach me			2
' there was never much interest in me when i was at school either , i used to think i was the ugly duckling , but maybe the boys are scared of me			2
' i do n't know what it is about us , neither of my daughters are married either			2
i have found relationships really difficult , i had the occasional boyfriend when i was younger but it only lasted a couple of months at a time			2
' success : before marrying , she had a successful modelling career and was crowned miss @entity9 in 1982 similar : in the 1990s , she forged a career as a @entity11 lookalike , even wearing the @entity58 safety pin dress winner : @entity5 poses with her granddaughter @entity60 after being crowned the @entity13 's most glam gran ' i spent a lot of time of time on my own and i was quite isolated			1
i was engaged to another man before i was married but the whole relationship only lasted six months - i just could n't go through with it			2
' despite her relationship issues , @entity5 eventually met and married her husband - and the father of her two equally beautiful daughters			1
' i met my husband in 1983 and we had a rocky romance - he just used to get so jealous , he was a pain , ' she reveals			2
now @entity5 says she is happy with her decision to turn her back on men , and unless the perfect partner comes along , she plans to concentrate on modelling			1
' here i am having a second bite at the cherry and i am not going to let anyone stand in my way , ' she insists			2
' my husband , who was seven years older , used to stand in my way with beauty competitions and say they were n't suitable			0
i just wanted a proper family life , that is what i set out for			0
' the relationship put me off men forever and i have been celibate for 13 years now			1
i think not having that pressure has made me stay looking and feeling young			0
' i have a lot of barriers but i just do n't think i have ever found the right man , there is a problem with the physical side			0
i find being affection very difficult , i ca n't even hug my own mum			0
' but i do n't want to be a little old lady with a dog and a cat - i suppose i am looking for someone but they have got to be right			0
' i want to find someone who has something in common with me , someone who is outgoing , likes going to see films and the theatre			0
i think my ideal man would be a cross between @entity111 and @entity112			0
' i am looking for love but i do n't go on dating sites - who knows what the future might hold though			1
' until she unearths the perfect partner , @entity5 plans to continue with her modelling career , which was given a new lease of life when she won the @entity13 's most glamorous grandmother pageant			1
for the event , she wore a 1950s inspired dress and performed a nursery rhyme with her granddaughter four - year - old @entity127			0
new career : @entity5 now hopes to build on her success and forge a second successful modelling career @entity5 , who looks after @entity127 full time , added : ' my daughter noticed the ad for this competition in the summer and encouraged me to enter			1
' i always had the philosophy that if you do n't enter you do n't get			0
everybody tells me i look very good for my age			0
i try to go for the old glamour like @entity140 and i adore the @entity142 style			0
' i think the judges were impressed with my outlook more than anything			0
i hope i inspire other women my age so they realise they are not too old to be glamorous			1
i 'm lucky because i can still eat what i like and do very little exercise			0
' instead she has one green smoothie a day which includes spinach , celery , lettuce and lemon juice and enjoys having an number of regular beauty treatments			0
@entity5 said : ' i do have a gym membership but i do n't use it , i just look after myself with facials and massages every week			1
' i also have regular trips to the hairdressers but i go to the hair college so it does n't cost very much because my daughter is setting up a beauty salon so i get treatments from her as well			0
' now she thinks her success with the latest competition means she could make a career out of being a film extra and in television commercials			1
@entity5 has already appeared as an extra in @entity170 in 2009 with @entity21 .			1

@entity5 , 54 , has been crowned the @entity13 's most glamorous grandma
she says her success is *due* to remaining celibate for more than a decade
but @entity5 is now looking for love but wants to continue her career
