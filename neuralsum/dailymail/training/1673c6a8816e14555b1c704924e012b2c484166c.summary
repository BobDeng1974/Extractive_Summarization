by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 gymnast @entity2 believes the @entity4 has proved just how quickly gymnastics is improving in @entity6 and is quietly confident that can translate into medals in october 's @entity9			1
the 21 - year - old double @entity11 bronze medallist achieved his aim of claiming all - around gold in @entity14 by smashing through the much - vaunted 90 - point barrier - the blue riband event for any gymnast - and now hopes to replicate his form in @entity18 later this year alongside the powerhouses of the host nation , @entity21 and the @entity22			1
@entity2 helped @entity3 to team gold while also winning the individual floor title , pommel horse silver and parallel bars bronze , four years on from competing at his first senior major competition at the @entity29 in @entity30			1
talented : @entity2 believes the @entity29 has proved just how quickly gymnastics is improving in @entity6 ' i 'm over the moon			1
it 's been an amazing competition and is one of my favourites by far , ' @entity2 told said			1
' it 's just been an amazing experience and has put us in really good stead for the worlds coming up			0
we 're really looking forward to it			0
' going from @entity30 i feel like i 've made a massive improvement and i 've put in a lot of new skills and that 's something i 'm very pleased about and hopefully i can continue it			0
' for this competition it was to hit the 90 mark and over ( in the all - around ) and i 'm happy as i 've done that twice here			2
hopefully i just need to to get that as consistent as i can and if i go to worlds and get over 90 hopefully that will bring a good result but as i say it 's what happens on the day			0
' one of the men @entity2 is set to face at the world championships is @entity21 's superstar gymnast @entity58			1
the 25 - year - old has won an unprecedented four successive world all - around titles and is widely regarded as the best male gymnast of all time			1
he is also @entity2 's idol			2
' that guy is unbelieveable and he wo n't be beaten for a long time i think , ' @entity2 said			2
' i 'm not looking at trying to beat @entity58 now , i 'm looking to get the highest score i can and if i can come close to @entity58 i would be honoured			0
i would be absolutely honoured			0
' i 'd like to think i 'm on his radar			0
i 'd like to think he knows but that guy is one of a kind			0
' silverware : @entity2 helped @entity3 to gold while also winning the individual floor title , pommel horse silver and parallel bars bronze @entity11 silver medallist @entity78 's much - heralded return following a lengthy break from the sport slipped into the realm of sideshow as he could only claim bronze on the pommel horse behind @entity2 and gold medallist @entity85			1
the 25 - year - old is now returning to his media career to sit on the judging panel of new gymnastics entertainment show ' tumble ' but @entity2 thinks he could live up to his word of coming back for the 2015 @entity9 in @entity14 ahead of a possible @entity11 return in @entity92			1
' it all depends on the make - up of the team but if he 's posting massive scores - if anyone is scoring massive scores - then they deserve to be in the team , ' @entity2 said			1
' it 's very hard to have a long break , especially in gymnastics			2
the longer you have off , the longer it takes to get back into it			0
it will be a very hard job to do			0
' but he 's proved he can do it here			2
pommel horse is n't the most demanding on the body so pommel horse is a good piece to do it on			1
he 's proved he can bring it back , he 's done a good routine but it 's hard to say			0
we 'll just have to wait and see			0
' all - rounder : @entity2 poses during the medal ceremony after winning gold in the men 's all round final with @entity78 out of the limelight until at least next year , it could be 18 - year - old @entity125 who steps up alongside fit again @entity85 , with the @entity128 teenager proving he has what it takes to cut it at senior level after winning high bar gold alongside other impressive performances after only being crowned junior @entity136 champion in may			1
' it 's getting stronger really quick and hopefully we can keep it up , ' @entity2 said of @entity6 's strength			1
' @entity141 , that was our first team medal in 100 years and that was really unexpected			0
it 's a big target of ours at the @entity9 and it will be a really hard job to get a team medal but that 's what we 're pushing towards and it 's one of our targets , it has to be			0
' our gymnastics is improving and hopefully we will improve as a team but we will have to wait and see			2
