@entity0 is keeping an eye on @entity3 's contract situation at @entity4 ahead of showdown talks with @entity7 bosses over a new deal			1
@entity9 boss @entity0 is still in the market for a defender and a striker , despite an already busy summer transfer window , and rates @entity3 as @entity16 's finest young defender			0
the 21 - year - old 's representatives will meet senior staff in @entity4 next week as the @entity20 centre back looks to at least treble his £ 25,000 - per - week wages to a figure more in line with other members of @entity4 's squad			1
class act : @entity3 is exactly the sort of defender that @entity0 is in the market for watchful eye : @entity0 will consider a move for the @entity20 centre back is his contract talks falter @entity3 has three years left on the deal he signed upon joining the @entity36 champions , under @entity0 's tutelage , in 2011 and is hoping his rise through the ranks to become first choice centre back at the @entity7 will allow him to negotiate an impressive new deal			1
but if @entity4 bosses do not submit to the @entity20 international 's demands he would consider a move to @entity45 - and his close bond with @entity0 would allow him to encourage @entity9 's interest			2
@entity4 have tried in the past to tie down their star youngster but without success and will be wary of @entity9 and @entity0 's interest which could see one of @entity16 's hottest prospects quitting the @entity55 capital for a move to @entity57			0
although a fee is yet to be considered with @entity3 's position uncertain , the bidding for any potential deal would likely start at around £ 25million			0
old pals : @entity0 celebrates a goal with @entity3 in a @entity65 semi final during his time in @entity4 pedigree : @entity3 would be a perfect replacement for @entity69 in the heart of the @entity72 defence			0

@entity20 centre back has asked his representatives to open contract talks
he is paid just £ 25,000 - per - week *compared* to @entity4 's other *top* stars
@entity80 earns more than *10x* @entity3 's basic wage
youngster will look for *clarity* with other squad members
@entity0 is looking for a defender and likes @entity3 from his time at @entity4
@entity9 are watching and could *swoop* but are some way off bidding
