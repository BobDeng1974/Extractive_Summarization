by @entity0 published : 08:36 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 16:03 est , 3 october 2013 a woman has told of how a failure to recognize her own overweight body in a photo motivated her to shed 80lbs			2
@entity6 @entity5 , a 29 - year - old from @entity7 , @entity8 , told @entity9 that a rapid maturation during puberty combined with comfort eating to cope with bullying led to her weight - gain during high school			1
but one day , when she glimpsed her 214lb self wearing a backpack in a picture taken by a classmate , ' i was horrified			0
i had no idea that i was wider than my overstuffed red bag , ' she said			0
this was not me , ' said the five - foot - two aspiring writer			0
' i was a bubbly , energetic person			0
how could such an enthusiastic person be buried inside someone so large ? ' calling this moment her biggest breaking point , @entity6 describes how seeing her ' two chins ' and realizing ' my arms were thicker than the thighs of most girls my age ' motivated her lose weight			1
' and that 's really when it clicked that i needed to do something , ' she explains			0
after skipping meals , with no avail , the then - 16 - year - old was enrolled in @entity45 , which saw her running and doing calisthenics every morning			1
' when 20 students depend on you to keep doing your pushups to avoid punishment , it 's amazing how much willpower you can find buried inside you , ' she explains in a piece on @entity55			0
before : it was a hard reality to accept			0
how could such an enthusiastic person be buried inside someone so large ? ' she says of her bigger high school years thanks to the high - octane exercise class , @entity6 says she lost 44lbs by the end of high school , and a double shift as a waitress in college led her to shed even more weight			1
how could such an enthusiastic person be buried inside someone so large ? ' what 's more , not having enough money in college to afford ' luxury ' foods forced her to stick to bare basics like lean meats and frozen vegetables			0
though she ultimately dropped to a healthy 134lbs , @entity6 says it 's still a battle to maintain her weight , which she writes about on her blog , @entity81 of a @entity82			1
' i struggle to still maintain my healthy weight and fitness patterns , ' she told @entity9 , adding that she is currently trying to establish a career as a freelance fitness and nutrition journalist			2
after : now , @entity6 follows a mostly @entity89 diet - which sees her avoiding grains , beans and dairy - but says the key to her healthy lifestyle is the occasional indulgence ' fortunately , i have more good days than bad as i have established fitness habits and a regimen that help keep me on track			1
' the regimen involves a mostly @entity89 diet - also known as the caveman diet - which sees her avoiding grains , beans and dairy			1
but @entity6 says the real key to her healthy lifestyle is the occasional indulgence			1
' i 'm human , ' she says			0
' so i stick with my diet 90per cent of the time and will have the occasional cheat , such as a pumpkin spice latte at @entity110 or a few @entity112 's peanut butter cups			2
' we always want what we ca n't have , ' she explains , advising others : ' do n't restrict - improvise ! ' visit @entity6 's @entity117 channel .			2

@entity6 @entity5 began losing weight after she was enrolled in @entity45 in high school
today , she blogs about her healthy lifestyle , which *includes* following a mostly paleo diet , also known as the caveman diet
