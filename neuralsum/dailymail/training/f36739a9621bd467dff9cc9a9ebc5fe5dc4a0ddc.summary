by @entity0 published : 09:29 est , 3 june 2012 updated : 03:09 est , 4 june 2012 in a resounding demonstration of patriotic pride , royal fans drowned out attempts by a group of republicans to sabotage the jubilee celebrations			1
when the anti-monarchists chanted : ‘ @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 : out , out , out ’ , the pro-royals all around spontaneously broke into a chorus of : ‘ @entity12 , @entity12 , @entity12 : in , in , in ! ’ their riposte drowned out the carefully planned protest and was followed up by an impromptu and rousing rendition of @entity17			1
not in the jubilee spirit : dozens of supporters of campaign group @entity20 gathered on the banks of the @entity22 near @entity23 , ahead of the arrival of the 1,000 - strong flotilla led by the @entity26 the demonstrators gathered at @entity23 in a stunt organised by the campaign group @entity20			1
it bragged that hundreds of supporters from across the country would descend on the capital for the ‘ biggest and boldest anti-monarchy protest of modern times ’			1
in the end barely 60 showed up			2
have you taken any pictures of the @entity40 celebrations ? from the @entity22 to your town , we want to see them			1
send them for publication to the @entity46 on the email address : @entity47 holding placards and banners saying ‘ citizen not subject ’ , ‘ @entity52 ’ and ‘ democracy not monarchy ’ , they taunted hundreds of families nearby			2
tensions between the two groups threatened to spill over and at one point security officers had to step in			2
among the republicans was gay rights campaigner @entity59 , who said in a speech that he had ‘ nothing against the @entity26 ’ but that he hated the institution of monarchy			0
he said : ‘ this queen has not been a disaster			0
but you only have to look back to the 1930s and @entity68 , a man who sympathised with the @entity70 regime			0
’ mr @entity59 branded the monarchy ‘ racist ’ because there would never be a black or @entity73 on the throne while the @entity76 family held it , and he accused the @entity26 of not representing all @entity78 people as she had never visited a gay or lesbian organisation			0
anger : a man holds a placard showing his feelings at the anti-monarchy protest that took place ahead of the pageant loud and clear : the protesters waved placards and banners saying ' citizen not subject ' , ' @entity92 ' and ' democracy not monarchy ' as they called for the abolition of the monarchy international effort : @entity20 said the protest involved representatives of the group 's branches in @entity101 and @entity102 , as well as a delegation from the @entity105 republican movement overcapacity : @entity106 to their twitter page to state : ' the # @entity110 viewing areas are now full ; please avoid and find an alternative location from which to view the event disrupted : part of the @entity115 was suspended due to a signal failure which made travelling around in crowds even more difficult for revellers mass : frustrated passengers travelling into @entity121 , @entity122 , found stations flooded with people and the trains themselves were swamped packed : thousands of eager jubilee pageant spectators overwhelmed the train network which struggled to cope with the rise in demand as people piled into central @entity122 @entity20 ’s chief executive @entity130 added : ‘ people are sick and tired of being told they must celebrate 60 years of one very privileged , very remote and very uninspiring head of state			1
’ typical of those pouring scorn on the republicans was @entity135 , an architect from @entity136 , @entity137			0
he said : ‘ the monarchy is the most important institution this country has			0
it is the symbol of our nation			0

dozens of supporters of campaign group @entity20 gathered on the banks of the @entity22 near @entity23 , ahead of the arrival of the flotilla
