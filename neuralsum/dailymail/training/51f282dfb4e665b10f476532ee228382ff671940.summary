the cost of petrol is set to fall again after a leading figure in @entity3 contemplated the oil price dropping to as low as $ 20 a barrel			1
the @entity6 said unleaded petrol and diesel could fall by 7p a litre to 107p and 114p respectively over the festive period			1
unleaded is currently averaging 114.07p and diesel 120.59p a litre			0
but it warned that cuts at the pump will be limited , however low the oil price goes , by the fact that tax makes up so much of the cost of petrol			1
fuel duty and @entity23 comprise nearly 70p in every £ 1 spent at the pumps			1
oil has already slumped by nearly 50 per cent to under $ 60 a barrel since mid-june but could drop further following astonishing remarks by @entity27 oil minister @entity39			1
he is arguably the most powerful figure in the @entity41 - dominated oil cartel @entity3 – the @entity3			2
he has insisted that production will not be cut back to restrict demand and push the price back up			1
‘ it is not in the interest of @entity3 producers to cut their production , whatever the price , ’ he told the @entity46			2
‘ whether it goes down to $ 20 , $ 40 , $ 50 , $ 60 , it is irrelevant			1
’ he added that the world may never again see oil at $ 100 a barrel			1
the @entity27 want to keep their large market share of the oil market by keeping down the price			1
mr @entity39 said that if @entity27 cut production ‘ the price will go up and the @entity61 , the @entity62 , @entity64 shale oil producers , will take my share ’			1
oil analyst @entity67 , at @entity68 , said the remarks represent a ‘ fundamental change ’ in @entity3 policy			0
he said : ’ we have entered a scary time for the oil market and for the next several years we are going to be dealing with a lot of volatility			0
just about everything will be touched by this			0
the @entity6 said unleaded petrol and diesel could fall by 7p a litre to 107p and 114p respectively over the festive period			1
unleaded is currently averaging 114.07p and diesel 120.59p a litre ‘ we have entered a scary time for the oil market			2
’ the drop in the price of oil spells good news for economic growth by putting more cash into motorists ’ pockets			0
the @entity96 says a prolonged oil price drop could boost global growth by up to 0.7 per cent next year and 0.8per cent in 2016			0
but it is infuriating green groups which fear cheaper fuel will put more cars on the road			0
@entity6 fuel spokesman @entity104 said : ‘ the current reductions in the wholesale price of petrol mean we ’re looking at 107p in the next two weeks and diesel 114p			1
retailers should still be reducing their current prices over the festive period			0
‘ we think the oil price is likely to stabilise a little over @entity114 as traders consolidate their positions for the break			2
the fall is expected to resume in earnest in the @entity120			0
’ he added : ‘ even if @entity3 keeps pumping oil far exceeding global demand , and the price of a barrel falls to $ 20 , the tax paid to the @entity123 on every litre of fuel fundamentally limits how low pump prices can go			1
oil prices are continuing to plummet around the globe and dropped to less than $ 60 a barrel in mid-june ‘ this is , however , another strong indicator that we could be on the way to seeing petrol at £ 1 a litre if the oil price continues to drop towards the $ 40 a barrel mark in the new year			1
’ @entity141 petrol consumption is still falling despite plunging prices at the pumps , according to @entity145 figures highlighted by the @entity31			2
they show that in november 2014 @entity141 drivers used just under 1.5billion litres of petrol at a time when pump prices fell to an average of 122p a litre			2
yet in november 2013 , consumption was more than 1.52billion litres at a time when pump prices averaged 130.4p a litre			0
however , diesel sales in november 2014 reached a record 2.50billion litres , up 6.1per cent on the october 2014 figure and 64 million litres higher than the november 2013 total of just under 2.44billion litres			0
@entity31 president @entity159 said : ‘ once again , the official statistics illustrate the trauma of cripplingly - high pump prices over recent years			0
‘ in 2012 , you could see the petrol consumption rise and fall in line with prices			2
now consumption is struggling to get out of the rut created by drivers and families being forced long - term to adopt fuel - saving travel patterns to make ends meet			0
’ mr @entity159 added : ‘ it suggests that the savings from lower pump prices are being used to balance the books of family expenditure rather than increasing mileages			0
this points to the likelihood that much of the spare cash will find its way back to the high street			0

petrol and diesel could fall to 107p and 114p respectively over @entity114
but tax *collected* by *chancellor* - 70p per £ 1 - will limit how far prices fall
oil has already slumped nearly 50 *%* to under $ 60 a barrel since mid-june
