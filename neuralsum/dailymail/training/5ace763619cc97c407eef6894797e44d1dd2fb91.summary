by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:09 est , 28 april 2012 updated : 08:35 est , 29 april 2012 with her long serge habit , make - up - free face and closely cropped hair hidden by a traditional wimple , she appears indistinguishable from her fellow @entity8 nuns			1
sister @entity9 is devoted to a never - ending ritual of worship and work at her convent with the 36 sisters who follow the @entity15 on an isolated 400 - acre farm			1
it ’s a life she was called to but it is hardly one the 44 - year - old glamorous blonde seemed destined for when she worked in @entity20 at @entity21 - with her ambitious young boyfriend @entity22			1
the ex who found @entity24 : sister @entity9 features in new documentary @entity24 is the @entity26 sister @entity9 ’s real name is @entity28			1
she is a former pupil of £ 24,000 - a - year @entity29 , from where she went up to @entity31 - meeting mr @entity22 when they were young undergraduates			1
@entity28 dated him from the spring of 1990 until summer 1991 , and while he worked at @entity21 , she went on to become the then prime minister @entity35 ’s correspondence secretary			1
then their lives took different turns			1
mr @entity22 was selected for political stardom , while @entity28 left politics to study at the @entity42 business school in @entity43			1
she became an executive in @entity45 for @entity46 , the advertising agency that inspired the television drama @entity49 - but the stresses of success , and , perhaps , of personal rejection , finally proved too much for her			1
she descended into a world of drinking and addiction before finally finding salvation in @entity24 at the abbey in the @entity59 hills , three hours north of @entity60			1
new life : @entity28 at the abbey , in smart dress and pearls , before becoming sister @entity9 ‘ i did think my life would progress on the normal tracks of meeting someone , marrying , having children , but that ’s not the path that @entity24 has led me , ’ sister @entity9 says in a new documentary revealing her story			1
photographs are shown of her when she was a young woman , posing in a leopard - skin top , dragging on a cigarette and savouring a glass of wine			1
but she admits that her lifestyle then brought her little except loneliness			1
she says : ‘ i feel like i tried most things in life that are supposed to make you happy			1
that journey took me down into alcoholism and drug addiction			1
’ it has been suggested that her downward spiral may have started soon after her break - up from the future prime minister			1
in a 2007 biography of @entity22 , a former colleague of the pair at conservative headquarters recalled @entity28 being granted a ‘ period of compassionate leave ’ to recover from the heartbreak			1
past life : @entity96 before she found @entity24 the authors say mr @entity22 was also shaken by the split and its aftermath , and add : ‘ perhaps as a result of the fall - out from his affair with @entity28 , @entity22 thereafter dated women outside politics			1
’ @entity28 later went out with the historian @entity106 , one of mr @entity22 ’s friends			1
when she moved to @entity60 to work as a strategic planning director at @entity46 , she found herself part of a social whirl that included aristocratic @entity111 and @entity113 trust fund heirs			2
newspaper diaries chronicled her presence at society events - at one polo match she mingled with @entity118 of @entity119 , @entity121 ’s granddaughter , @entity122 , and a billionaire polo - playing friend of @entity125 , @entity126 , who is married to model @entity127			2
she spent freely , renting a £ 15,000 - a - month summer home with pool and tennis court in the exclusive enclave of @entity132 on @entity133 , regarded as the summer seaside playground of @entity113 ’s wealthy elite			2
but by 2008 she had apparently become overwhelmed by problems with substance abuse , and declared that she had decided to become a nun			1
she recalls : ‘ i remember having to tell my mother , “ i ’m going to join the abbey , ’ ’ and she said , “ yes , i can see this world has no real meaning for you any more			2
’ ’ i looked at this place and saw women who had what i wanted			2
‘ you make a decision here to surrender your life to @entity24			2
’ @entity28 seems to have embraced the lifestyle wholeheartedly			2
the film shows the formal ceremony that she went through in order to join the order of nuns			2
she is seen dressed in a smart fuchsia dress and knotted pearls - then happily allowing the sisters to untwist her long blonde hair from a bun and cut it back			2
a wimple is then placed around her head before she is introduced to the congregation by her new name			2
‘ this is the only place i could see myself being - because this is where it ’s at , ’ she says			0
she is seen at prayer , weeping with emotion			0
‘ she really is committed to the abbey , ’ said a source who met her at a service to which the public were admitted			0
‘ her mother and sister were at the service			0
the nuns chanted in @entity183			0
’ last week , answering a telephone call from @entity188 , the convent ’s porter , mother @entity185 , described how , as a novice , @entity28 must go through an apprenticeship known as ‘ formation ’			0
@entity28 took her vows four years ago , but formation lasts for as long as five - and - a - half years			0
only at the end of this apprenticeship will she be eligible to take holy orders and assume the title of ‘ mother ’			0
ex : @entity22 in 1987 , during his time at @entity31 asked whether sister @entity9 could speak , mother @entity185 said she was too busy to come to the phone , explaining : ‘ she ’s out of the house and on the land			1
she ’ll be busy until vespers			0
’ to outsiders , the regime at the @entity207 may seem harsh			0
the first bell of the day rings at 2am to announce @entity210			0
then it clangs at first light , again at 8am for @entity213 and then at regular intervals until vespers , at 5pm			0
chores for interns such as @entity28 include mopping the chapel floors , tending a herd of dairy cattle and scrubbing the pails that senior nuns use to churn butter			0
@entity28 is embracing the lifestyle , despite the apparent hardships			0
‘ a monastic life , this is where the struggle is , ’ @entity28 says in the film			0
‘ there ’s no way out			0
you do n’t get to leave and go to a movie			0
‘ you do n’t get distraction from all the human emotions			0
it ’s like this hothouse where things get worked out			0
’ the film featuring @entity28 is called @entity242 , the title referring to the convent ’s @entity244 and her former life , which was also glamorous			0
she is a one - time @entity247 starlet , @entity28 , who appeared with @entity248 in two of his films , @entity249 ’ you and @entity251 , before entering the order in 1963			0
happy couple : the prime minister married @entity255 in june 1996			0

she dated @entity22 in the 1990s while working at @entity21
it *'s* thought he was so shaken by their split that he never romanced someone in politics again
by 2008 she had apparently become overwhelmed by problems with substance abuse
