@entity10 , 24 , of @entity11 , @entity9 ordered an extra cake for her engagement party , but after a disagreement between her sister and the cake maker , the result left a bad taste			1
the baker , @entity18 , is said to have become annoyed at @entity20 ’s sister for not specifying what type of cake she wanted , and sent her a pile of ‘ chocolate poo ’ with a flag stuck in it , telling the party guests to ‘ eat s * * * ’			1
' congratulations on your engagement ! ' : @entity9 baker @entity18 sent this unfriendly message to her customer after a disagreement according to local media , ms @entity10 ’s sister had won a $ 50 voucher from @entity37			1
the voucher , reduced to $ 30 as @entity37 ’s owner claims $ 20 was owed from a ‘ separate business engagement ’ , was set to cover an engagement party cake for ms @entity10			1
ms @entity18 , who runs @entity37 , claims ms @entity10 ’s sister ‘ got what she deserved ’ for not specifying what she wanted other than ‘ chocolate ’			2
‘ i have no regrets at all about what i did			0
i feel she got what she deserved , ’ the @entity47 entrepreneur told the @entity48 on sunday			0
‘ i do n't make cakes as a business			0
it is just a hobby and i 'm taking it all with good humour			0
’ expectation vs reality : when ms @entity10 's sister ordered a ' chocolate cake ' she probably meant something looking more like this one after it was picked up , @entity18 posted on @entity62 : ‘ your ( sic ) left with a $ 30 voucher and you want a cake still ? ? ok cool - give me some ideas ? ? oh wait you have none apart from wanting chocolate			2
i have a brilliant idea for your cake ! ! ! - so here it is , your turd cake ! hope you learn your lesson			0
’ a text , claimed to be from ms @entity10 ’s sister , was also posted by ms @entity18 on her social network : ‘ we r ( sic ) just at my sister 's engagement and got your cake , we and every1 else is absolutely disgusted			2
’ the posts were later removed			0
‘ the cake was for an engagement party and this woman is not remorseful at all , which is disappointing , ’ the family member told the @entity9 newspaper ‘ it was wrapped up in a box , so it was done deliberately as a nasty surprise			1
it was a disgraceful thing to do			0

@entity9 cake maker had a disagreement before engagement party
sister of the bride - to - be was not specific enough when ordering dessert
so @entity18 of @entity47 sent a ' faeces cake ' to the party
although edible , it appears the cake *remained* *untouched* by guests
