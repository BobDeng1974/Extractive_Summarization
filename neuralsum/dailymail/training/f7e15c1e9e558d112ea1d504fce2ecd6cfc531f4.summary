by @entity0 last updated at 4:18 pm on 8th august 2011 @entity2 's @entity1 have launched an application which can track lost children - but they insist that they are not taking the vital information provided to spy on users			2
the controversial @entity7 - which is free - went on sale at the end of last week in @entity2 and is designed to help parents speed up the process of contacting the relevant authorities should their young on go missing			2
when the app , which needs a mobile device with a camera , is activated , the @entity1 , the police and the @entity15 can be contacted at the click of a button			0
helping hand : child id has been launched to help parents in @entity2 to quickly contact the authorities should their child go missing compatible with @entity28 's @entity27 , @entity29 2 and @entity30 , the new application allows those with young ones to fill in vital statistics about their children , so that they can save time when raising the flag if one goes missing			1
parents will be invited to input information about their child 's height , weight , name , nicknames , ethnicity , date of birth , home address and a variety of other important information that would assist police in finding the lost child			1
along with the statistics , parents should , in addition , take a photograph of their little one with the mobile device and send that along with the other information			1
the @entity1 have said that they are developing plans to add support for using pictures stored on the device - a move that will allow parents to use photos taken with another camera and sent to the mobile device via e-mail or a direct transfer			2
the new application , which is free , was released on friday further , the application has tips about the best steps that a parent can take after a child goes missing			2
however , the @entity1 underlined that data about children will not be held by the organisation or by @entity28			1
indeed , they insist that the only way information about the child can be viewed by the @entity1 is if the user of the application sends it and activates the application			0
aside from the @entity27 and @entity29 , the @entity1 intends to develop the application so that it can be used on other mobile devices including @entity78 and @entity79 phones			0
one other likely step with the application would be sending gps data when parents transfer data to help local police forces locate the user , and hopefully cut even more time			1
also the @entity1 noted that ' you can show the pictures and provide physical identifiers such as height and weight to security or police officers on the spot '			0
since the release of @entity97 id the main criticism has been the lack of password protection on the application - without it , the phone could find its way in to the wrong hands			0
either false reports could be filed - a waste of time and money for police - or the child 's vital statistics could be accessed and stolen			1
' the @entity1 ( and @entity111 for that matter ) is not collecting or storing any photos or information that you enter in the app , ' a statement from the @entity1 read			0
' all data resides solely on your mobile device unless you need to send it to authorities			0
