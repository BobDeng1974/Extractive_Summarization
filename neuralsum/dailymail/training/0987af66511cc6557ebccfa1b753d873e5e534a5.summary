by @entity0 published : 07:19 est , 9 march 2012 updated : 12:01 est , 19 march 2012 @entity2 's largest electricity supplier @entity1 will pay back a paltry £ 50 to households as penance for its doorstep selling practices			1
the @entity7 - owned energy giant admitted door - to - door staff were not trained to give customers all the information they needed			1
and call centre workers trying to sell the firm ’s energy tariffs would boast about possible savings without knowing whether the statements were accurate			2
£ 4.5m settlement : @entity1 staff failed to provide potential customers with complete information , ruled @entity20 an investigation by energy watchdog @entity20 exposed gaping holes in @entity1 ’s policies designed to prevent vulnerable customers being ripped off by cold - calling salesmen			1
while the firm did have measures in place , they did not go far enough , the regulator ruled			0
faced with a mammoth fine , the power group said it would pay out £ 3.5million to the poorest households it supplies			1
but the sum comes to only £ 50 for each of the 70,000 homes judged to be ‘ needy ’ by the firm			0
the company also agreed to pay £ 1million to an energy awareness campaign run by @entity40			1
the £ 4.5million total is , however , the largest penalty payout ever demanded from an energy firm in this country			2
the 70,000 homes receiving the one - off payment are already on the company ’s @entity47 scheme , where they receive a rebate of £ 120 a year			2
however , the average @entity1 dual fuel bill is still £ 1,129 each year , and even with the extra £ 50 saving , families will have to fork out almost £ 1,000 to heat their homes			2
@entity1 acknowledged ' limited shortcomings ' during 2010 last month @entity1 unveiled profits of £ 1.6billion – £ 427 for each of its 3.7million @entity2 customers			1
yesterday the company admitted ‘ limited shortcomings ’ in its sales in 2010 – the period investigated by @entity20			0
@entity61 , managing director of energy sourcing and customer supply , said : ‘ we ’re obviously disappointed that we failed to live up to the high standards that we expect of ourselves			0
‘ as soon as the issue was identified we immediately took action			0
’ @entity20 is also investigating @entity68 , @entity69 ( formerly @entity70 and @entity71 ) and npower			0
@entity73 , of @entity20 , said : ' in the energy market in general much more needs to be done to restore consumer confidence and all energy suppliers should now get behind @entity20 ’s reforms to introduce a simpler , clearer and more competitive energy market			0
' the @entity1 payout comes just 24 hours after it was named the worst of the major power suppliers for customer service			2
@entity82 , director of energy at @entity84 , said it was positive that an energy company has worked with the regulator to tackle the issue			1
she added : ' we 've called for @entity20 to have the power to make sure energy customers benefit from any fines - so it 's good news that this voluntary approach has led to customers being compensated rather than money returned to the @entity98			1
' @entity100 secretary @entity99 said tougher rules were now in place over the information suppliers have to provide to their customers			0
he added : ' we are now looking at beefing up @entity20 's powers further so it can make companies compensate consumers directly in cases like this , rather than having to rely on a voluntary approach			0

@entity7 - owned energy company will pay out £ 3.5m to vulnerable customers rather than face larger fine
@entity1 will also make £ 1m donation to citizens **advice** for energy **advice** campaign
