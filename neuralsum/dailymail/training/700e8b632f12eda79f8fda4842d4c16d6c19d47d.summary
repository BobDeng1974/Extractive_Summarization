rechargeable bulbs that use nothing but sunlight could help bring lighting to areas with little or no access to electricity			1
@entity9 's $ 15 ( £ 9 ) @entity8 solar bulb recharges even in poor weather and lasts for six hours on a full charge			1
it has been designed for areas where there is limited or no electricity , but can also be used for camping trips or during power cuts			1
the bulb lasts for more than six hours following a day ’s charge in low light , and this charging time drops to four - hours when used in bright sunlight the @entity8 is a follow - up to the @entity34 - based firm ’s @entity32 bulb , and the second - generation model won the 2013 @entity36			1
earlier this week , a @entity38 study claimed solar prices are falling at a rate at which they will undercut prices for conventional energy sources such as coal and oil by 2016			2
the study is based on the assumption that the @entity48 government will keep its 30 per cent tax credit for solar in place			0
however , it added prices are likely to reach the lower level , even if this credit was dropped to 10 per cent			0
the report added that because solar is a technology , not a fuel , its price will continue to fall as the technology is made more efficient			0
the awards are aimed at rewarding innovations that use patented technologies to address humanitarian needs			0
@entity65 , the bulbs are not designed to replace electric versions , but instead are on par with kerosene lamps and similar devices used in poor areas			2
on its highest setting , the @entity8 reaches 13.5 lumens , compared to 850 lumens for a 60 - watt bulb			1
it takes around a day to charge the @entity8 in low light , but this charging time drops to four hours in bright sunlight			1
the waterproof @entity8 is slightly larger than a traditional bulb , and it is fitted to a chrome - plated steel loop			1
this can be swivelled to face the sun using a single solar cell , and the power is distributed across four leds			1
solar power is stored in a 1,000 @entity85 , which the firm claims will last for two years , and can be replaced for $ 1 ( 63p )			0
each bulb costs $ 15 ( £ 9 )			0

this can be swivelled to face the sun using a single solar cell ( pictured right )			2
solar power is stored in a replaceable aa - sized , 1,000 @entity96 , which the firm claims will last for two years a power - saving mode also means the bulb will only shine when light falls below 200 lux - the equivalent to lighting on a cloudy , stormy day			1
