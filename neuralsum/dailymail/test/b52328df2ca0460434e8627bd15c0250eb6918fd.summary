could these be the boots of a disembodied samurai soldier , lingering mysteriously behind this little girl ? a spooky dark visage that appears behind the child in this photograph has sparked online rumours of a ghost			1
this photograph was captured in @entity8 , @entity9 - ' nearby some samurai tombs ' , apparently - late last year			1
the @entity12 user who posted it online - a friend of the photographer - insisted it was ' not photoshopped ' and that paranormal forces could be at work			1
' i 'm not saying it 's anything - just that it looks an awful lot like disembodied boots and legs ... ' ' @entity19 ' told users			1
' i know there are several very old samurai tombs nearby			1
' again , not saying that this is what is there , just that , based on preliminary research , this is my best guess ... ' photographs from the same set show the little girl with nothing behind her and the snapper ' swears ' there was nothing behind her at the time			1
in this picture from the same set , no one appears to be standing behind this little girl however , in this other picture , the black boots have returned another conspirator suggested they could be combat boots from the @entity72 era			1
' my grandfather was in the pacific theater ( @entity9 ) in @entity72 and i recognize what the man in the background is wearing			1
its a @entity78 from @entity72			2
' but not everyone was so convinced by the tricky picture			2
some users suggested it was likely an optical illusion - a trick of the light - or the presence of a real - life human being			0
' looks like a living person in boots and dark pants and a light blue , possibly denim colored shirt , ' said @entity92			1
sceptics have noted the presence of a blue piece of fabric lingering behind the little girl ' because of the perspective , the rest of the person is hidden behind the girl last month , a chilling image emerged on the ' @entity103 ' @entity102 past , with its owner claiming it showed the ghost on a young drowning victim			1
the photograph , which was taken in 2014 , was posted on @entity102 by @entity110 @entity109 , from @entity111			2
social media users are claiming that the white shape at the back of the image , circled , shows a ghostly face photo was taken at @entity118 which is the same location 13 - year - old @entity120 drowned in 1915 was it @entity120 ' ghost ? ms @entity109 claims her daughter 's leg was grabbed by something in the water the image appeared to show two women and four children swimming at @entity118 in the @entity130 , south - east @entity111			1
but ms @entity109 and @entity131 , the other adult in the photo , were adamant they were only accompanied by three children			0
it provoked fierce discussion online after it was revealed a little girl had died in the watering hole a century prior			1
a @entity141 newspaper clipping from november 22 1913 included a death notice for a little girl who died in that watering hole			2
' @entity148 , aged 13 years , eldest daughter of mr. @entity147 was accidentally drowned whilst bathing in the @entity149 on friday afternoon , ' the notice read			0
' nearly an hour elapsed , before the body was recovered			0
the spot , which has always been considered dangerous , is known as @entity152 , and is over 20 foot deep			0
ms @entity109 insisted : ' at the time of taking this photo there was nothing between us			0
' i 'm holding the little girl and that white head next to me with horns is not human , i can promise you that			2
' its fingers are on my shoulder and on my daughter 's arm			0
they are long skeletal type fingers			0
' an admin from the @entity170 posted a negative version of the image , saying : ' light flare will always show up as black shadowing when the photo is inverted			1
. and in this case the light flare is coming from full sunlight reflecting off the water onto the child ' tragic @entity120 was only 13 when she accidentally drowned in the swimming hole in 1915 disturbingly , ms @entity109 claims that there had been strange occurrences that day as they swam in the water , which only firms her belief that a spirit was present			2
' on this day my daughter had her leg grabbed two times by something in the water			0
' ' when i went back in for one last dip to cool off i did feel something behind me as i was walking out of water but tried to ignore it			0
ms @entity109 was convinced the shadowy visage in the photograph was @entity120 's photograph			2
a sceptic responded to ms @entity109 's claims , pointing out another possibility			0
' the eye sees what it wants to see			0
in my opinion , it 's nothing more than a splash of water , ' wrote @entity210			0
' notice the child facing away from the camera - their left arm has just surfaced , causing a splash			2
' @entity216 had another explanation : ' i think it is another kid just the sun is over exposed more on the face as they are facing the sun. ' the ' @entity103 ' @entity102 page administrators were not convinced by either explanation			0
' we used to swim there all the time growing up and all i can say is just to be safe i 'm never swimming there again ! ' they wrote			0
ms @entity109 posted the photo on the @entity102 page the administrators were shocked by the photo , writing ' we used to swim there all the time growing up and all i can say is just to be safe i 'm never swimming there again ! ' ms @entity109 claims that two paranormal experts looked at the photograph and after extensive investigation came to the conclusion that the shape in the image is a child who drowned in the river in 1915 ms @entity109 was also of the opinion that the figure in the photo was a demon who tried to take her daughter the spot , which has always been considered dangerous , is known as @entity152 , and is over 20 foot deep			1
