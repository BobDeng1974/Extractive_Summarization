@entity5 fan @entity63 said on @entity23 : ' @entity2 , [ i ] think it 's awful and disrespectful you cut to adverts as they were laying wreaths in the stands - poor , poor on your front			1
and season ticket holder @entity71 said : ' @entity2 - well done on cutting to adverts when flowers were getting placed , and managing to miss the majority of the minute ’s silence			2
’ @entity77 added : ‘ @entity2 - would have been nice to have shown the full silence for the two @entity5 fans rather than adverts			1
’ remembered before the match : @entity20 , 63 , and @entity21 , 28 , were killed in the crash in @entity83 flowers : the tribute from @entity33 and @entity34 came before @entity5 beat @entity86 4 - 0 in @entity27 but a @entity2 spokesman told @entity88 that the channel was sorry for what happened , saying : ‘ we apologise for any upset caused by a mistimed break during the @entity5 game			1
' @entity2 - well done on cutting to adverts when flowers were getting placed , and managing to miss the majority of the minute 's silence			1
disgrace ' @entity71 , @entity5 fan ‘ the timing was unintentional , and we will show the tributes and the minute ’s silence in full at the end of the game , as well as put all the footage online			1
’ this was later welcomed by @entity5 fans , with ' @entity106 ' saying on @entity23 : ' good that @entity2 replayed the minute 's silence at the end			1
they should never have cut to the adverts in the first place			0
' the channel also later posted on tweet linking a video of coverage of the tribute on its website			0
@entity117 , a £ 5million summer signing from @entity119 , marked his debut with a goal on 26 minutes as @entity5 cruised to a 4 - 0 victory over @entity15 in the friendly			2

the @entity138 scored three times in 14 first - half minutes as @entity140 took full advantage of goalkeeper @entity143 's 19th - minute error before @entity117 and then @entity144 struck			2
' the timing was unintentional , and we will show the tributes and the minute ’s silence in full at the end of the game , as well as put all the footage online ' @entity2 spokesman @entity5 keeper @entity153 had only one save to make to deny @entity154 after the break , and substitute @entity156 rounded off the scoring seven minutes from time			1
after the game , @entity33 said of the fact the men 's bodies have not yet been returned from @entity83 to their families : ' the after effects of the plane crash have n’t been great			0
' they are having to suffer that as families and we are as fans too			0
the site has not been secured and the publicity around it has n’t been great			0
' @entity33 had earlier insisted that the forthcoming season would be dedicated to the two fans who died on the @entity175 flight			0
he said : ‘ none of us would be sitting here without the fans			0
reaction : @entity2 faced an angry backlash from @entity23 after the ' mistimed break ' ‘ owners and managers come and go , as do players , but the fans are always there , and these two guys in particular , to go to the lengths that they did to get out here , has brought home just how important supporters are to us			1
‘ sometimes when you lose lives in that manner , it puts into context what we do			0
this season we want to give their families something to remember them by , by having a successful season			0
’ @entity33 also thanked the @entity205 fans who put their usual rivalry to one side and have now raised more than £ 23,000 in tribute to mr @entity21 and mr @entity20			2
‘ a lot is made of the rivalry between the two cities , and of course that is there , ’ he said			0
‘ but i would like to thank all the @entity205 fans who have paid tribute and helped raise a staggering amount already			0
i am very proud of @entity205 for the way they have conducted themselves and i want to thank them			0
