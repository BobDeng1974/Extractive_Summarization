have you ever panicked about whether you locked the front door , been woken by a @entity3 notification or desperately needed a phone charger ? to deal with these sorts of everyday emergencies , one company has designed a range of prototype products			1
you can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product , funded through a @entity15 campaign			1
they asked groups to design products to deal with common problems			1
these include forgetting to lock the door , which one company hopes to solve with their @entity27 prototype , shown the products were designed as part of the @entity32 design makeathon			1
they asked people to pick their top ten ‘ everyday emergencies ’ - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives			1
groups from @entity45 - based design company @entity44 were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist			1
not being able to sleep ( 46 per cent * ) 2			0
losing your keys ( 37 per cent ) 3			0
being stuck in traffic when already late ( 35 per cent ) 4			0

forgetting your bank card when paying for an item ( 25 per cent ) * how many people thought this was a problem in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep			1
so a group called @entity76 designed a product called ‘ snooze ’ , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night ’s sleep			2
to deal with not remembering if you had locked your door , @entity84 created the @entity87 - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door			1
it fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it ’s locked			2
this means that even when out or about , you can find out if your door is locked or not			2
another group designed @entity99 - the world ’s smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , @entity103			2
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost			2
direct line is running a competition on @entity114 where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about @entity120 , @entity111			1
the @entity27 is coloured green and red and fastens on a key			0
