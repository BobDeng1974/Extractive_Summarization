by @entity0 published : 10:34 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 10:34 est , 11 september 2013 between sleepless nights , nappy changing and post-natal blues , getting back to work is often the last thing on the minds of new mothers			1
fully immersing oneself in the world of new parenthood can be all - consuming			0
so it 's perhaps understandable that when mothers do eventually return to the office , it takes them at least four months to get back up to speed			1
according to a new study , six in 10 mothers find readjusting to the workplace challenging , with an average of 3.8 months required to get back into the swing of things			2
challenging : it takes the majority of new mothers at least four months to get back up to speed at work the study also revealed that many mothers share similar concerns about returning to work - chief among them the fear that they might bore childless colleagues with baby talk			1
other mothers panicked about accidentally arriving at work with fingerprints and food stains on their clothes , while 17 per cent said they were worried about missing their child			1
on a more positive note , just 10 per cent thought they might run into trouble with their boss by making regular calls to their childminder			0
of the new mothers who do choose to return to work , 40 per cent said they do so because of financial pressure			1
but three quarters admitted that they would n't be happy to go out to work if it meant their partner stayed at home instead			2
' returning to work can be a daunting shift and can lead to feelings of insecurity and lack of confidence , ' said psychologist dr @entity60			1
advice : dr @entity60 says mothers should n't feel guilty			1
right , @entity63 says a glamorous makeover with new haircut , clothes and a handbag helped boost her confidence before returning to work ' as well as worrying about getting back into the job you also have to juggle childcare needs			1
get into a routine so that the mornings run smoothly			0
' she continued : ' @entity76 clothes out the night before , fill the kettle up and put things by the front door that you need to remember			2
' when at work do n’t be afraid to ask questions , nobody is going to expect you to know everything on your first day back			2
' the survey , which was carried out by @entity86 , found that new mothers employed a variety of ways to boost their confidence , including splashing out on new clothes and a new hair cut			1
others said having an early night , wearing their favourite outfit and updating their hair colour also helped			0
among those to treat themselves ahead of a return to the office was homes guru and @entity99 ambassador , @entity63			2
' i had a new hairstyle , new clothes and bought a new handbag both times , ' she revealed			2
let go of any feelings of guilt about going back to work			0
i know from working with families that this is often an issue for parents but remember that you ’re setting a good example for your children and helping to provide for them			0
as with any big change , nerves are inevitable , but remember all the things that you enjoyed about your working life before parenthood and focus on the positive transferable skills that you ’ve learned from having your child			0
balancing work and home life is a challenge that we all face			0
discuss your options with your partner and family and friends , and have back up plans in case something crops up at work or at home			0
be honest with yourself and with your employer and colleagues			0
do n’t be afraid to be open about your concerns – often those around you will be able to support you in dealing with them			0
boost your confidence : new make - up , fresh hair colour and wearing your favourite outfit can all help you feel more confident on that first day back .			1
