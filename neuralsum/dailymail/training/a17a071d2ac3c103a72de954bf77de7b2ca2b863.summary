reports of cannibalism have previously emerged in @entity4 during some of the darkest periods of the country 's past			1
there were said to be instances of cannibalism in remote @entity94 - the @entity96 system of forced labour camps established under @entity98			0
in 1933 , 6,000 people were deported en masse from @entity100 and @entity101 to isolated @entity102 in @entity103			0
the plan was for settlers to bring virgin land into production and ultimately become self - sufficient			0
in reality , they were abandoned on a desolate island with nothing to eat but flour , a few tools , and insufficient clothing			0
already weak from the five day journey to the island , during which they received virtually no food , the settlers were given only flour to mix with river water upon arrival , and malnutrition and dysentery was widespread			0
reports of people resorting to cannibalism in near anarchical conditions on the island were rife			2
of 6,000 people deported to @entity128 , 4,000 died			0
the devastating famine caused by the two and a half year @entity130 , which lasted from september 8 1941 until january 27 1944 and saw around 800,000 people starve to death , led to rumours and reports of cannibalism emerging after supplies of birds , rats and pets had been exhausted			0
during the winter from 1941 to 1942 , there were reports of hungry gangs attacking and eating people			0
police in @entity101 were said to have established a special unit to combat cannibalism , and 260 people were reportedly jailed for the crime during this period			0
