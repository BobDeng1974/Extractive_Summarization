@entity0 and his @entity2 crew may have broken the law by switching number plates on his @entity5 during their controversial trip to @entity7			1
the tv show 's presenters ' convoy was attacked by locals armed with rocks , sticks and pickaxe handles amid claims the @entity17 number plates were a reference to the @entity19			1
@entity0 , 54 , has insisted the plates ' apparent reference to the conflict were an unfortunate coincidence and were changed as soon as it was noticed			1
but the scandal engulfing the show deepened today when it emerged that by attaching the vehicle 's previous number plates , @entity0 and his crew may have broken the law			1
they claimed it was a reference to the the 1982 @entity40 conflict pictures from after the car was attacked show the controversial number plate - h982 @entity17 - had been changed to one previously registered to the vehicle - @entity44 ( shown , left ) the @entity2 team ( pictured during their trip to @entity7 ) including @entity47 ( far left ) , @entity0 ( second left ) and @entity48 ( far right ) were forced to flee the country after being hounded by a mob @entity0 was spotted in @entity51 , west @entity52 , today after flying home after flying home from @entity55 records show the car - which last changed hands in august , weeks before the ill - fated trip - was registered as @entity17 to the @entity5 featured in the show in 1991			1
but it was later changed to @entity44 - the registration plate later attached to the car in @entity7 - by a previous owner in 2001 , before being changed back			1
records suggest that the @entity44 plate is now registered to another car in a @entity68 , a @entity69 , and has been since 2006			1
the @entity70 today confirmed that it is an offence to drive a car ' in this country or abroad ' under a plate assigned to a different vehicle			1
a spokesman said : ' the @entity68 rules are clear – a vehicle can only display a registration mark that is currently assigned to that vehicle			2
' failure to comply with these rules can result in a fine of up to £ 1,000 and enforcement of this offence would be a matter for the police			0
' we would always advise motorists planning on taking a vehicle abroad to check the vehicle registration rules of the individual registration authorities			0
' the @entity90 has said it is looking into the controversy but is unable to comment on the issue at present			0
it came as @entity0 claimed that @entity7 allegedly told @entity55 officials to stop the crew entering the country as they tried to flee from the angry mob			1
@entity0 said the number plate was a coincidence and was not meant as a reference to the @entity100 the presenters ' cars were left by the side of the road in @entity7 before they fled across the border to @entity55 the presenter said they faced difficulty crossing into @entity55 when the @entity7 ordered that they were stopped			1
he told @entity109 : ' their plan was to then arrest the crew for entering the country illegally			2
he added : ‘ ' luckily for us , we ’re really popular in @entity55 and they love the @entity68 so the official refused			2
in fact his direct quote was , “ i told them , f * * * you ! ”			0
’ @entity0 described the official as a ‘ real hero ’ and also praised the police officers who escorted the film crew safely into @entity55			1
he also accused the @entity7 of taking advantage of their visit for ' political capital ' and said the violent protest was ' state - organised '			2
‘ the more i think about this , the more i ’m convinced we were set up by the local government , ’ he added			0
the attack took place in @entity133 , on the southern tip of @entity7			2
the crew later fled over the border to @entity55 @entity0 ( pictured after landing at @entity137 ) said the number plate was a complete coincidence the drama unfolded when the @entity2 convoy was attacked with rocks , sticks and pickaxe handles as it made its way through the country during filming for a special edition of the @entity90 motoring show			1
@entity0 said he was forced to hide under a hotel room bed with his co-stars as an armed mob rampaged after them and shouted : ‘ this is a mafia state , best you do as you 're told '			1
they were eventually forced to flee @entity7 under police escort – three days earlier than planned - as the furious thugs tried to ' kill ' them			1
the controversial number plate is not likely to be a private one and was attached to the car when the @entity90 received it for filming , a spokesman for the show said			1
the h at the beginning of the plate represents the year in which it was produced - 1991			2
@entity17 , the last three letters , represent where the vehicle was first registered			2
the numbers in between these characters are chosen at random by the @entity70			0
@entity5 confirmed today the car was not bought from them by producers at @entity2 , but from a private owner			1
motorists can not transfer a registration plate if it will make the new car look younger			2
they faced a gruelling six - hour journey to the @entity55 border in a collection of hired 4x4s , trucks and the three ' star ' cars that the crew had planned to use in the ‘ car football match ’ for the show			1
they eventually made it to a remote border post where there was not even a road , but a river , and boarded a tractor to cross the water into the neighbouring country			2
earlier , @entity0 took to @entity197 to confirm that he , along with the rest of the @entity2 team , had not meant to cause offence with @entity17 plate			1
he wrote : ' the number plate was a coincidence when it was pointed out to us , we changed it			1
' and these war veterans we upset			0
mostly they were in their 20s			0
' they threw us out for the political capital			0
thousands chased crew to border			0
someone could have been killed			0
' this was not a jolly jape that went awry			0
for once , we did nothing wrong			0
' we had planned a good ending for the show			0
but thanks to the government 's foolishness , it 's now even better			0
' @entity2 executive producer @entity225 has told the @entity226 : ' @entity2 production purchased three cars for a forthcoming programme ,			2
' to suggest that this car was either chosen for its number plate , or that an alternative number plate was substituted for the original is completely untrue			1
' @entity0 took to @entity197 upon returning to the @entity68 to clarify that no offence was intended to be caused april 2007 - referring to a car made in @entity236 , he said it was built by ' jungle people who wear leaves as shoes '			1
october 2009 - claimed tv producers were obsessed with having ' black @entity243 lesbians ' on screen			0
january 2012 - he compared synchronised swimming to the deaths of 23 @entity248 cockle pickers in @entity249 in 2004			0
january 2012 - @entity0 mocked the clothing , trains and food in @entity253 , as he ridiculed the country 's sanitation by driving a @entity256 fitted with a toilet through slums			1
the @entity253 high commission in @entity52 formally complained to the @entity90 about the comments			0
march 2013 - the presenter joked that a bridge with an @entity264 walking across it had a ' slope on it '			0
the @entity90 later apologised but said it was not aware of the racist term at the time			0
in july , @entity271 ruled @entity0 had deliberately used racist language , but the @entity90 did not take action against him			0
april 2014 - he took to @entity197 to introduce his new dog - a black terrier he named @entity276 after the @entity278 and @entity51 footballer , @entity277			0
may 2014 - @entity0 was caught in a clip reciting the rhyme : ' @entity281 ' before mumbling what sounded like ' catch a n * * * * * by his toe '			2
@entity0 initially denied the incident but then backed down and said he was ' mortified ' and ' horrified ' when he realised it ' did appear that i 'd actually used the word i was trying to obscure ' .			0
