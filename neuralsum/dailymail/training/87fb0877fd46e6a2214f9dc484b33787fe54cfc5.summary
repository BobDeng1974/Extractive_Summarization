@entity2 special forces failed in an attempt to free the @entity5 hostage who @entity7 militants have threatened to kill , @entity0 confirmed this morning			1
the foreign secretary said the government was now considering a number of ways to protect the hostage , adding : ' we will look at every possible option			2
' mr @entity0 also said @entity5 would also ' certainly consider ' airstrikes against @entity7			2
mr @entity0 's remarks came after jihadist militants released a second sickening video yesterday which showed @entity2 journalist @entity20 being beheaded by a fighter with an @entity23 accent			1
at the end of the video , a @entity5 hostage is filmed on his knees in a similar orange jumpsuit to those worn by the two men already killed by the extremist group , sparking fears he could be their next victim			1
last month the @entity57 revealed it had launched the attempt to rescue a number of hostages held in @entity61 , including @entity62 , the journalist killed in the first video			1
but the mission failed to bring back any hostages because the jihadist gang had moved prior to @entity2 commandos ' arrival			2
mr @entity0 suggested this morning that @entity5 could launch a fresh rescue attempt to save the captured @entity70			1
he said the government had been aware of a @entity5 citizen being held by @entity7 for some time and confirmed that the @entity2 had launched a failed attempt to save him and @entity2 hostages after a meeting of the government ’s emergency cobra committee , mr @entity0 said the hostage situation would not alter the government ’s overall strategy on dealing with @entity7 militants			1
he said : ‘ it ca n’t allow us to change our overall strategy			0
we ’ve been aware of this hostage , of course , for some time , but we have to deal with is on the basis of the wider threat that they pose to the @entity5 public , as well as to this individual			2
’ he said the situation would not affect the likelihood of @entity5 airstrikes against the militants			2
‘ it does n’t make any difference at all to our strategic planning			0
as the prime minister said , we will look very carefully at the options available to us to support the legitimate government of @entity104 and @entity105 in defending themselves from the threat of @entity7			0
‘ and if we judge that airstrikes could be beneficial , could be the best way to do that then we will certainly consider them , but we ’ve made no decision to do so at the moment			0
’ he confirmed that @entity5 analysis of a video released yesterday appearing to show the @entity5 hostage , as well as the execution of @entity2 journalist @entity20 , had concluded it was genuine			1
‘ the @entity2 president will be making an announcement shortly on the basis of @entity2 analysis , but our preliminary analysis is that this video is genuine , that it is mr @entity20 , and that it appears to be the same person with an apparently @entity5 voice that appeared in the last video			2
‘ obviously our thoughts are with the family and friends of mr @entity20 and we ’re doing everything we can to reassure the family of the @entity5 hostage who was shown in the video			1
’ it is believed the @entity5 hostage , who is not being named by @entity5 media , and @entity62 ( pictured ) , who was the first man killed in the videos , were the subject of a failed rescue mission earlier this summer journalists mr @entity20 ( left ) and mr @entity62 ( right ) had been covering the war in @entity61 when they were kidnapped @entity46 has chaired a number of secret @entity146 meetings in recent months focused on the @entity5 hostage and options to secure a safe release			1
last night , the prime minister was briefed by his senior security officials on the developing situation , ahead of today 's meeting of @entity146			0
mr @entity46 has hit out at the ‘ absolutely disgusting , despicable ’ murder of mr @entity20			0
he said : ' if verified , this is a despicable and barbaric murder			0
my thoughts and prayers are with mr @entity20 ’s family and friends tonight as they deal with this appalling and tragic situation			0
' as i have said consistently over the last few weeks , @entity7 terrorists speak for no religion			0
they threaten @entity61 , @entity104 , @entity2 and @entity5 people alike and make no distinction between @entity166 , @entity167 or any other faith			1
' he is not thought to have spoken to president @entity170 , who is travelling to @entity171 ahead of the @entity45 summit in @entity173 later this week			0
the @entity5 hostage is believed to be an aid worker who was based on the @entity177 border of @entity61 , working with victims of war			1
government sources have stressed that @entity5 has a long - standing principle not to publicise kidnappers or terrorists			0
but @entity5 authorities are in touch with the man 's family and are continuing to provide support for them , it is understood .			0
