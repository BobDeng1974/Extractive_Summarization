by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:39 est , 4 april 2012 updated : 20:03 est , 4 april 2012 overweight or obese ? @entity2 underestimates how fat a person is in nearly half of cases the obesity epidemic could be far worse than previously realised because of serious flaws in the way body fat is measured , according to a study			1
researchers said the @entity2 – the formula usually used to determine fat – drastically underestimated how many people should regard themselves as unhealthily overweight or obese			1
more than a third of adults in the @entity17 are considered obese			0
but the @entity19 study concluded that 39 per cent of @entity17 were being classified as overweight on the basis of their @entity2 when they were actually obese			1
the study ’s authors , dr @entity24 , of @entity25 , and dr @entity26 , the @entity27 health commissioner , calculated the @entity2 – weight in kg divided by height in metres squared – of nearly 1,400 adult patients at a private health clinic			1
they then compared the results with those of a more sophisticated measurement , a blood test combined with a @entity39 ( @entity39 ) scan , which measures a person ’s body fat , muscle mass and bone density			1
the comparison found @entity2 wrongly classified half of the women , and one in four men			1
while only 26 per cent of the patients were classed as obese according to @entity2 , 65 per cent of them fell into that category when measured with the @entity39 scan			1
dr @entity24 said @entity2 should be called the ‘ baloney mass index ’ because it was so inaccurate			1
the most widely used way to measure an adult 's weight is to calculate body mass index ( @entity2 )			1
this is your weight in kilograms divided by your height in metres squared			0
if your @entity2 is between 25 and 29.9 , you are over the ideal weight for your height ( overweight )			1
if your @entity2 is between 30 and 39.9 , you are obese			1
if your @entity2 is over 40 , you are very obese ( known as ‘ morbidly obese ’ )			2
however , this method ca n't take into account if you are muscular			0
‘ @entity67 is an insensitive measure of obesity , prone to under - diagnosis , ’ he said			0
the study found @entity2 was especially prone to underestimating obesity in women			2
in addition , the likelihood of error increased as they got older			0
fifty - nine per cent more women aged 70 or over were classified as obese when measured with a @entity39 scan than their @entity2 suggested			2
researchers said this was because women lost more muscle to fat than men as they age			0
as @entity2 does not distinguish between muscle and fat , it does n’t pick up on the change			2
‘ @entity2 does not tell you how much fat you have , ’ dr @entity24 added			2
n deaths from womb cancer have increased by 20 per cent over the past decade , driven by rising obesity , experts warn			0
the death rate in the @entity96 from womb cancer has risen from 3.1 to 3.7 per 100,000 since the mid- 1990s			0
this means more than 1,900 women are dying from the disease each year , compared with fewer than 1,500 at the turn of the millennium , the charity @entity98 said			0
reporting in the open access journal @entity105 researchers recognised that @entity2 was a convenient , low cost and safe way of calculating a person 's weight			2
it is the most widely used way to measure weight in the @entity17 and @entity96			0
however , the authors said the outdated mathematical equation needed to evolve to correctly evaluate body fat			0
' these estimates are fundamental to @entity17 policy addressing the epidemic of obesity and are central to designing interventions aimed at curbing its growth , ' the authors said , ' yet the [ current policies ] may be flawed because they are based on the @entity2			0
' the authors said levels of leptin , a hormone protein , are strongly correlated to body fat			0
they suggested that if @entity39 was deemed to expensive that leptin levels could be used alongside @entity2 to create a more accurate picture of obesity .			1

combining @entity2 with blood test to measure levels of key protein would be ' more accurate '
