by @entity0 published : 09:19 est , 18 december 2012 updated : 13:18 est , 18 december 2012 this is the horrifying moment gangsters chased and killed an innocent 17 - year - old student after mistaking him for a rival gang member			1
@entity6 footage shows victim @entity7 who was ' in the wrong place at the wrong time ' running away from @entity12 , then 17 , and @entity13 , then 18			1
moments after the teenagers were captured running after him and a friend , @entity14 was stabbed 14 times in the back in a ' cowardly and merciless ' murder			1
the 17 - year - old was mistaken for a rival in a ' poisonous and senseless ' gang war , a court heard today as @entity12 and @entity13 were jailed for life			1
the pair were members of the @entity30 gang - @entity28 - out to avenge one of their numbers who was stabbed by a rival gang member from the @entity34 gang - guns and @entity35 - just hours earlier			1
his killers had toured housing estates in @entity38 to find rival gang members and came upon the 17 - year - old son of a sports broadcast journalist and his friend , who had nothing to do with any gangs			1
when they caught up with him , they stabbed him 14 times in the back @entity14 , a business student , promising footballer , a budding actor and rapper , was walking back with a friend from a session at a recording studio when they were confronted by @entity13 and @entity12 in the @entity69 in @entity38			1
@entity14 and his friend with a ' sixth sense ' ran away into a cul de sac where his friend ’s aunt lived in a desperate attempt to get to safety - but she was not at home			2
his friend managed to jump over a wall but @entity14 was trapped and then killed on march 2 of this year			2
he shouted out he was from @entity79 and pleaded ' i ’m not from round here , i ’m not from round here ' but he was murdered by the pair who had persuaded a shopper to buy them at least one substantial kitchen knife just hours before the attack			1
after an @entity90 jury found the pair guilty @entity12 , now 18 was jailed for a minimum of 19 years while @entity13 , 19 , was jailed for 20 years			1
sentencing judge @entity93 said : ' i am entirely satisfied having heard the evidence the background to this terrible offence is to be found in revenge between two gangs			0
' around 1.15pm @entity101 a member of @entity30 gang was stabbed 28 times while sat in a bus while it was stationary at @entity105			1
@entity12 , left , and @entity13 , right , of the @entity28 gang , were today jailed for 19 and 20 years respectively for the murder			1
neither have shown an iota of remorse , said the judge @entity14 , a budding rapper , had been walking back from a recording studio when his assailants struck - he sought shelter at the home of his friend 's aunt in a nearby cul - de - sac but tragically she was not home ' it ’s clear from the evidence a very short time from that stabbing you found out about it and decided this stabbing needed to be avenged			1
' your purpose was to carry out an attack on a @entity34 gang member and anyone you believed to be so			1
' you encountered two boys @entity14 and his friend by reason of they only being on the @entity133			0
' you believed them to be gas gang members , they were not and have no connection whatsoever with this gang			2
' he said @entity14 ’s friend managed to escape but @entity14 ' was not so fortunate '			0
' he was heard to shout " i ’m from @entity79 " saying to you he was in effect not from around there and had no reason to be chased			0
it was to no avail			0
' he was violently attacked suffering 14 stab wounds , three of which penetrated his lungs and one his liver			0
' it would have been abundantly obvious to you he was gravely injured but you ran off thinking only of your escape			0
' he added : ' it was @entity14 's misfortune to be in the wrong place at the wrong time			2
' but judge @entity155 added @entity12 , who was on bail at the time for robbery , and @entity13 ' have shown no an iota of remorse			1
' @entity160 , prosecuting , told jurors : ' @entity14 's death was but a part of a poisonous and senseless feud between two rival gangs of youths in south @entity167			1
' judge @entity155 said @entity14 ’s father , a sports presenter in @entity169 , described his son as ' vibrant , energetic , enthusiastic and promising boy			0
' the father , in a statement read to the court , added : ' hours before his horrendous death he had gone to the studio to record a track which he dedicated to his mother			2
‘ the sudden and tragic death of @entity14 has deprived us of a brother , son and friend			0
' he is ever present in our minds			0
the damage @entity14 ’s death has caused the family is irreparable			0
our lives have been ruined and will never be the same again			0
’ he was in the sixth - form of @entity190 , had moved from @entity169 to @entity167 in 2002 , and excelled in sport , music and acting and had great ambitions to make something of his life			2
@entity12 , who was living at a bail hostel in @entity198 , had been in youth court on the morning @entity14 was stabbed for breaching his bail conditions for robbery but the prosecution could not find his file so the case was adjourned for a week			1
that day their friend @entity101 was stabbed on the top deck of a bus in @entity105			1
@entity13 , seen here fleeing the scene , told police ' stabbings happened everywhere ... it 's how life is now			1
everyone gets stabbed , everyone gets shot			2
everyone dies , everyone goes to jail , that 's how life is ' @entity6 cameras recorded them travelling to see him at @entity224 before heading to a shopping centre in @entity198 to buy a knife from a @entity227			1
when the shopkeeper refused to sell them the weapon without seeing a passport or driving licence they asked a stranger to help , claiming one of their mothers needed it for cooking			0
the pair then got a taxi driver to take them to @entity38 and drop them off at the edge of the @entity69 at 5.30pm			0
at that time @entity14 , who lived in @entity79 , happened to be walking through the estate with one of his friends after leaving the recording studio			0
@entity101 whose knifing prompted the murder had been wearing a t - shirt which bore the slogan ‘ @entity255 ’ - a reference to @entity254 murdered eight months earlier in july 2011			0
@entity13 had worn a similar t - shirt in a @entity258 video posted online which was entitled “ @entity262 ” and paid homage to @entity261			1
jurors heard @entity13 was close friends with @entity254 and starred in ‘ @entity262			1
’ when police searched his home they found photos of three other murder victims - @entity269 , who was shot dead aged 16 in 2007 ; @entity270 , 25 , who was shot dead in may 2011 ; and @entity271 , 16 , who was shot dead in june 2011			2
@entity13 told police they were all his friends and added : ‘ stabbings happen everywhere ... it ’s how life is now			1
everyone gets stabbed , everyone gets shot			2
everyone dies , everyone goes to jail , that ’s how life is			1
in a typical black area , people get stabbed , people get shot , people die			2
’ @entity7 's uncle said today that the killers should serve the rest of their lives behind bars to set an example to other gang members intent on violence			1
@entity297 said no - body was safe until the message got across			0
speaking outside the @entity90 he called for a tougher crack down on gangs and their members as his nephew and his friend were innocently in the area to use a recording studio and were attacked for no other reason			0
he said : ' something has to be done			0
as my brother said you do n't need a visa to go to that area			0
they just went there for a purpose			0
it may happen to other people			0
' all we say is life should be life for them			2
if not they will come out and do it again			0
life should be life so it sets and example for all the other people			2
' detective chief inspector @entity328 said : ' @entity14 was an entirely innocent young man with a bright future in front of him			0
' he was selected at random , just because he was walking through an estate deemed to be enemy territory by these two violent gang members			2
' video : @entity336 led to conviction in @entity338			0

@entity7 was mistaken for a rival gang member
two teenagers ' who showed no remorse ' stabbed him fourteen times
@entity12 jailed for 19 years and @entity13 for 20 years today
@entity12 was in youth court on day of attack for breaching bail conditions
@entity13 told police : ' everyone gets stabbed , everyone goes to jail , that 's how life is '
