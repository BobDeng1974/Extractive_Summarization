@entity15 have hailed @entity1 a hero since he slew the 25ft - long monster , which snatched his wife @entity18 as she collected water from the lake with friends			1
the 50 - year - old spent an hour and a half in mortal combat with the beast , and puts his victory down to a special weapon he had specially made for the battle			1
' i had so much fear in me but what helped me to succeed was the spear , ' he told the @entity32			2
mr @entity1 , a fisherman , was left feeling devastated and powerless after the death of his wife four months ago			1
she was eight months pregnant when she was snatched , leaving nothing behind for him to remember her			1
local media reports say the crocodile was suspected of eating six women and children who had gone to fetch water at the same spot , on the shores of @entity44 's @entity5 , but locals had been able to do nothing			1
then last month mr @entity1 , still aching with grief , heard the beast had returned			1
he decided the time had come for revenge			0
but first , he needed a weapon			0
' i really wanted my revenge , and asked the blacksmith to make me a spear that could kill the crocodile dead , ' he said			1
this spear was no normal weapon			2
the blacksmith designed it with a barb along one side , so that when plunged into the crocodile 's belly it would rip the beast 's flesh when pulled back out			2
vengeful mr @entity1 tied a rope to the shaft of the spear then , with a few friends from the village , he went to meet the monster that killed his wife and child			1
when the group arrived at the water 's edge , they found the immense crocodile still there			1
but when mr @entity1 's friends saw the size of it they took fright and begged him not to provoke it			2
remembering his wife , mr @entity1 would not stop			1
he told them : ' i 'm not bothered if i die killing this beast			0
i 'm going to take it on with this spear , and i will make sure that it dies			2
' after instructing his friends to throw stones to distract the crocodile , the widower charged and drove his spear deep into the crocodile 's side			2
enraged , it tried to bite back , but mr @entity1 was able to dodge its deadly jaws			2
' it turned violent , and then there was so much fear in the place , ' he told the @entity32			0
' but i was so determined , and i was n't afraid of dying			0
' i just wanted it dead , so i put the spear in its side and i pulled the rope			0
that got the crocodile into trouble			0
' but even with its belly ripped open , the monster was not ready to lie down and die			0
mr @entity1 and his friends spent an hour and a half battling the beast , attacking and retreating , striking and dodging			2
finally , it was dead and mr @entity1 and his victorious crew dragged the crocodile back to their village			1
@entity126 were shocked at its immense size , he said			0
' we believe this was the same animal that killed the woman , ' a @entity141 official told the @entity152 press agency , @entity151			0
@entity153 , chairman of @entity155 district , which encompasses mr @entity1 's village of @entity158 , called on the @entity141 and the government to compensate mr @entity1 for the loss of his wife			1
speaking to @entity44 's @entity163 daily paper , he blamed the @entity141 for not responding to locals ' calls for the area 's crocodiles to be relocated			0
but @entity168 , a @entity141 official , said the organisation does not compensate for people killed by crocodiles			0
he said the @entity141 was in the process of relocating the crocodiles in the area to the @entity175 or @entity176 , @entity177			0
but those moves , and the accolades from his neighbours , have come too late for mr @entity1 , who has never even had a chance to mourn at his wife 's grave			1
' within myself i 'm a very depressed man , ' he said			0
' i lost a wife and an unborn child			0
