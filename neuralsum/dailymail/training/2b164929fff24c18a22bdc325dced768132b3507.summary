@entity1 's police chief said monday that it 's important not to rush the case against the man accused in the disappearance of a @entity7 student , despite criticism of some of his decisions			1
about a week after @entity13 disappeared september 13 , @entity12 came to the police station to ask for a lawyer			1
@entity17 's apartment had just been searched and while not a suspect at the time , he was considered a ' person of interest			1
' he left the police without being charged and sped away , prompting police to issue an arrest warrant for reckless driving , authorities said			1
' we caught some criticism when mr. @entity17 walked out that door on that saturday afternoon			2
people could n't understand : " how do you just let the guy walk out the door ? '' ' @entity1 police chief @entity29 said			1
' we made a commitment to honor certain constitutional protections that people have in our criminal justice system , and as frustrating as it is , we want to be very careful to get it right , not to rush to judgment			0
' at a briefing earlier monday , investigators asked people who knew @entity17 , a former college football lineman and sometime cab driver , to come forward with information so that they can develop a better profile of him			1
as they did , about 35 people scoured an area of hundreds of square miles surrounding downtown			0
@entity17 was arrested last month after fleeing the state of @entity40			2
he was found camping on a beach in @entity71 , @entity46			2
pictured above on september 26 , being escorted by federal authorities off a plane back in @entity40 @entity29 said in the interview that the goal of asking for more information about @entity17 was to try to figure out areas he may have been familiar with as they assess where to focus their search			1
' what are the places where he 's most comfortable ? ... if you were to take someone against their will , you 're going to take them to someplace likely where you 're comfortable			0
you 're not going to go out in the dark and hope for the best , ' he said			0
police say forensic evidence also connects the 32 - year - old @entity1 man to the 2009 slaying of @entity94 , a 20 - year - old @entity95 student			2
@entity29 says hope is fading that they will be able to find @entity35 alive			0
pictured above at a september 24 briefing @entity29 declined to discuss the evidence against @entity17 or whether he might be charged in the @entity94 case			1
asked whether he expects to find @entity35 alive , @entity29 said : ' every day that passes is not a good sign			2
every day that passes translates more to recovery than rescue			0
but at the end of the day , we still have to find @entity13			0
' he said he thinks about the case constantly			0
' i lay in bed at night going over , what have we done differently , what could we do differently ? ' he said .			0
