by @entity0 published : 18:50 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 19:32 est , 12 march 2013 surprise intervention : the new archbishop of @entity4 @entity3 with his wife @entity5 the archbishop of @entity4 yesterday signalled a softening of his opposition to gay marriage – and suggested the @entity10 could even back civil partnerships for straight couples			1
in a surprise intervention , the most reverend @entity3 suggested his main concern about the government ’s gay marriage proposals is that ‘ they do n’t actually include people equally ’			1
speaking to @entity19 he said it would be ‘ completely absurd ’ to suggest that gay relationships were less loving than heterosexual ones			2
he said the @entity10 was ‘ open to discussions ’ on the issue			2
he added : ‘ i think that the problem with the gay marriage proposals is that they do n’t actually include people equally , it ’s called equal marriage , but the proposals in the @entity32 do n’t do that			1
‘ i know plenty of gay couples whose relationships are an example to plenty of other people and that ’s something that ’s very important			2
‘ i ’m not saying that gay relationships are in some way … you know , that the love that there is is less than the love there is between straight couples – that would be a completely absurd thing to say			2
‘ and civil partnership is a pretty … i understand why people want that to be strengthened and made more dignified , somehow more honourable in a good way			0
it ’s not the same as marriage			2
’ dr @entity3 , who highlighted the difficulty of keeping the worldwide @entity10 community on board , confirmed his opposition to gay marriage as recently as last month			1
his comments will be seen as a significant softening of the @entity10 ’s stance			1
they seem to suggest that if straight couples were allowed to have civil partnerships he would be prepared to accept gay marriage			1
the @entity65 , a complex set of proposals that would allow gay marriages to be conducted by registrars and those religious organisations that wish to , is going through @entity71			0
civil partnerships for same - sex couples , which were introduced in 2005 , carry the legal rights of marriage but lack the full symbolic commitment			0
the new archbishop , who will be enthroned next week , has already caused controversy this week after he signed a strongly - worded letter from 43 bishops that claimed the @entity83 ’s welfare reforms would ‘ disproportionately ’ affect children and were ‘ unacceptable ’			0
but he later appeared to soften his stance , saying that the current benefits system is ‘ shot full of holes , wrong incentives and incredible complexity ’			0
his latest remarks came as it emerged that the @entity10 had indicated support for heterosexual couples to be allowed to form civil partnerships – despite warnings that the move would undermine marriage			1
@entity3 confirmed his opposition to gay marriage as recently as last month the @entity100 , the right reverend @entity101 , told mps considering the @entity32 that extending civil partnerships to straight couples would ‘ fulfil a need ’ for couples who wanted to make a commitment that falls short of marriage			1
but a @entity108 source said it was ‘ utterly illogical ’ for the @entity10 – which is traditionally a key defender of marriage – to be promoting civil partnerships			1
@entity113 mp @entity112 has tabled an amendment calling for civil partnerships to be extended to straight couples			0
this is a key demand of gay rights campaigner @entity117 , who argues that the new gay marriage laws will otherwise discriminate against heterosexuals			1
ministers are resisting the move , arguing that it would undermine marriage			0
the archbishop of @entity126 's comments are being viewed as a softening of the church 's stance on gay marriage the @entity100 , who was representing the @entity10 in discussions on the @entity32 , told mps : ‘ it seems a strange anomaly that heterosexual couples can not register a civil partnership			1
‘ you have only got to look at the figures for marriage			0
there are now 100,000 fewer marriages in this country each year than there were 20 years ago			0
the figures are quite striking , and that has given much greater acceptance of remarriage after divorce			0
‘ a great many heterosexual couples decide not to get married , and they do so conscientiously – it is not an accident			0
it may well be that heterosexual civil partnerships might fulfil a need for them			0
’ a government source said ministers were astonished by the bishop ’s comments , given that the @entity10 had previously argued strongly in favour of marriage as ‘ part of the glue that has bound countless successive societies together ’			1
the source said : ‘ our @entity32 is about opening up marriage to more people			0
‘ it ’s a bedrock of our society binding families together and promoting stability – we see it as a gold standard			0
‘ it seems utterly illogical that the @entity10 would advocate opening up civil partnerships at the expense of marriage , especially when they have previously been arguing it ’s fundamental importance to our way of life			1
’ the support for extending civil partnerships also came under fire from the @entity181 , dr @entity182 , who hit the headlines a decade ago when he became the first openly gay priest to be nominated as a @entity10 bishop			2
he declined the post in the face of protests from traditionalists			0
mr @entity182 said civil partnerships should be abolished altogether once gay marriage has been legalised			1
he told @entity132 : ‘ my worry is that civil partnership may bring about the very thing the @entity10 says it fears , which is that somehow the idea of faithfulness and monogamy will be diluted			2
