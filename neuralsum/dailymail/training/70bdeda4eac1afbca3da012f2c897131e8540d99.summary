@entity0 made it five wins from five in november with a dominant display at @entity4 , exacting a spot of revenge on the team that pipped them to the @entity10 title last season			1
four well - worked goals , scored by @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity17 - born @entity16 , saw off @entity18 , as @entity20 's side continued their remarkable rise up the @entity22			1
the @entity23 sit in third with 19 games played , and are just a single point behind @entity27 at the top of the table			1
@entity13 of @entity0 opens the scoring during the @entity22 rout of @entity18 on saturday @entity16 ( number 19 ) celebrates with team - mates after scoring his side 's third game @entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity36 6 ; @entity37 6.5 , @entity38 6 , @entity39 6.5 , @entity40 6.5 ; @entity41 7 , @entity42 6.5 ; @entity43 7 ( @entity44 66min , 7 ) , @entity45 7 ( @entity15 89 ) , @entity13 7 ; @entity16 7.5 ( @entity46 84 ) subs not used : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 scorers : judge 29 , @entity44 74 , @entity16 82 , @entity15 90 +2			1
booked : @entity53 manager : @entity20 8 @entity18 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity55 6 ; @entity56 5 , @entity57 5.5 , @entity58 5 , @entity59 5 ( @entity60 45min , 5 ) ; @entity61 4.5 , @entity62 5 ( @entity63 57 , 5 ) ; @entity64 6.5 , @entity65 6 , @entity66 6.5 ; @entity67 6 ( @entity68 90 ) subs not used : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity68 , @entity73 booked : @entity61 , @entity65 , @entity62 , @entity58 manager : @entity75 5 man of the match : @entity16 referee : @entity79 ( @entity80 ) 6 attendance : 10,923 @entity82 was one of four changes made by @entity18 boss @entity75 , as they looked to arrest a slump in form that had seen them lose their last three games			1
@entity82 started in central midfield against his former side and was on the receiving end of some full - blooded challenges in the early stages			0
not that he was afraid to give it back , mind			0
the former @entity97 man landed a reducer on close friend @entity41 before picking up the first yellow of the game for a cynical foul on @entity43			0
the visitors , despite not seeing as much of the ball as @entity0 in the early stages , posed the bigger threat , particularly @entity66 , the @entity105 winger celebrating his 100th appearance for the club			2
some diamond - encrusted commemorative boots to mark his century were confined to the warm - up due to @entity112 regulations , but his replacement white pair nearly produced the goods when he whipped a free - kick on to the roof of the net from 35 yards early on			0
and then , in the 16th minute , @entity67 glanced a header on to the underside of the crossbar following decent play by @entity64 down the left			0
@entity37 of @entity0 holds off the challenge of @entity66 during the match at @entity4 @entity43 ( right ) is tackled by @entity58 as @entity0 moved to within a point of leaders - leaders @entity27 @entity0 broke the deadlock against the run of play , @entity13 timing his run brilliantly to meet @entity43 's cut - back from the left side of the box , drift past the two @entity18 centre backs , and prod a finish past @entity55 and into the far corner			1
wolves were immediately on the hunt for an equaliser , and so nearly got it when @entity66 's rasping strike was parried away by the alert @entity36 at his near post			0
@entity20 's team , doing what they could to use @entity16 's pace to stretch @entity18 , nearly doubled their lead in the 34th minute			2
the striker , released by his home - town club wolves at 13 , raced past @entity56 and dinked an inviting ball to the back post , but no @entity0 player could touch it beyond @entity55			2
after a tepid start to the second half , @entity14 ' introduction for @entity0 sparked the hosts into life			2
one of his first involvements was to set judge clear , only for the midfielder 's delicate lob to be clawed away by @entity55			0
@entity66 wore some custom made boots during the warm - up to commemorate his 100th @entity18 game play is halted after a distress flare is thrown onto the pitch during the match between @entity0 and @entity18 @entity170 the @entity18 goalkeeper clears the ball under pressure from @entity16 five minutes later @entity44 made it 2 - 0 , with a crisp strike after some eyecatching footwork from @entity45 on the edge of the @entity18 box			1
the attacker , on loan from @entity179 , jinked away from @entity60 and @entity57 and fired a pass to the sub at the back post , and he slid the ball calmly into the back of the net			0
on 82 minutes , @entity16 , who looked so dangerous when given time and space to run in to by @entity18 , added a third with thumping effort into the roof of the net , before @entity15 completed the scoring in added time with a neat finish under @entity55			2
before the game , talk of where @entity0 would play if they secured promotion to @entity198 's top tier was brushed aside by @entity20			1
after another maximum return , their fans , at least , will be beginning to dream .			0

@entity0 beat @entity18 4 - 0 at @entity4 to *consolidate* play - off position
the @entity23 are just one point behind league - leader @entity27 after easy win
it was @entity18 's fourth straight *defeat* in the championship
