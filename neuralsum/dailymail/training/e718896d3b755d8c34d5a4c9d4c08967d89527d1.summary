when cartoonist @entity1 proudly posed before cameras with his mbe he revealed his rock star brother @entity4 had stepped in to join him because his son could n’t make it			1
@entity1 ’s son – also called @entity4 – was sailing the @entity8 on a ‘ once in a lifetime ’ voyage to the @entity10 and beyond			1
@entity1 junior blogged from the island of @entity14 that he was ‘ so , so proud ’ of his father and told him and his multi-millionaire uncle @entity4 to have an ‘ amazing day at @entity16 ’			1
but they were in handcuffs after being arrested for allegedly trying to smuggle £ 3million of cocaine out of @entity21 and on to the streets of @entity25			1
they face up to 15 years in a rat infested jail after 30kilos of the @entity47 drug was allegedly hidden in the fuel tanks and fire extinguishers of their yacht , the @entity51			2
the trio are among 27 suspects , including three @entity54 and a @entity21 woman called @entity56 , arrested in police operations in @entity21 in the last month that have seen more than a ton of drugs seized			2
the @entity54 men were arrested in possession of cocaine and ecstasy and are believed to belong to a gang called the @entity66			2
raid : the moment @entity21 police boarded the @entity51 boat to search for drugs allegations : officers swooped on the 37 - year - old former pub owner , whose father @entity1 is musician @entity4 's brother , while he was onboard his 39ft boat the @entity51 claims : the cocaine was reportedly hidden in fire extinguishers and gas cylinders in the cabin @entity1 ’ father @entity1 , 71 , who was honoured for his services to art in january , must now endure an agonising wait to learn the fate of his son because of @entity21 ’s notoriously slow legal system			1
speaking from their £ 500,000 home in @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity1 ’ stepmother @entity92 , 58 , said : ‘ this is a very , very distressing time			1
’ it is a far cry from the excitement of six months ago when @entity1 and his crewmates set off from @entity97 in @entity98 in their 28 - year - old @entity100 cruiser			1
the former pub manager and his friend @entity35 , a pharmacist , had bought the yacht for £ 65,000 in 2010 telling the broker they were planning on taking a gap year to the @entity107			2
the pair had been friends since attending the elite @entity110 , a well - respected grammar school in @entity91			2
proud : @entity1 ( right ) with brother @entity4 ( left ) as he received his mbe for services to art earlier this year			1
@entity1 's son @entity4 called to say he would not be able to attend @entity115 , the previous owner of the @entity116 , said : ‘ they said they had taken an intensive zero to hero course teaching them to sail and they were planning a trip to the @entity107			1
it is the perfect yacht for that			2
’ they made an attempt to sail to the @entity10 soon after buying the yacht but had to be rescued by the @entity129 just south of @entity98 , after one of its masts broke			0
undeterred they waited a year before setting off again in september , even pressing on after their engine failed hours into the voyage			2
@entity1 kept a blog detailing their journey which included stop offs in @entity141 in @entity142 , where they got their engine fixed , the @entity144 and @entity145 off the coast of @entity147			1
they then sailed to @entity149 where they spent @entity151 with their girlfriends who had flown out to meet them			0
after leaving the island the three friends island hopped to @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 before arriving at @entity14 off the coast of @entity162 on january 23 , 2012			0
it is from there on january 26 that @entity1 writes of his regret at missing his father being awarded the mbe			1
he blogs : ‘ originally i thought i was going to be able to attend			0
the reality with this unpredictable sailing lark is that it was unfeasible which upset me greatly			0
’ discovery : this police video shows the cocaine was allegedly hidden in fire extinguishers from this point the blog takes a darker tone as @entity1 writes about his friends falling out after a night in a casino			1
then , after paying $ 1,000 to get through the @entity183 , he writes about befriending a ‘ crazy @entity184 ’ who claims his nephew is the vice president of @entity184			0
this man apparently directs them to @entity189 in @entity184 telling them to mention his name to a man called @entity193 and ‘ he will sort everything out for you ’			0
when they arrived in @entity189 on february 20 and eventually find mr @entity193 it appears he owns the yacht club ‘ and about 20 of the huge fishing boats out in the harbour ’ and arranges for his engineers to make repairs to the @entity51			0
@entity1 and the crew eventually left @entity189 on march 1 , heading south down the coast of @entity184 to test their new engine before heading out into the @entity208 to the @entity107			1
by now @entity1 appears tired of his travels and reveals he is planning to fly home when the yacht returns to the @entity183 after the @entity107			1
seized : @entity1 was later humiliatingly paraded in front of @entity214 television cameras			1
next to him were bags full of cocaine found in several recent raids in his last blog entry on march 4 he says : ‘ we have been away for nearly five months but only recently has it started to take its toll			0
’ but eight days later the three were arrested after their boat was intercepted leaving the @entity224 in @entity37 , more than 1,000 miles away from the @entity107			2
national police director @entity225 said the arrests showed his officers were effectively disrupting the ‘ international tentacles ’ involved in the country ’s illegal drug trade			0
the three @entity25 were paraded in front of cameras with their hands cuffed behind their back next to bags full of cocaine from recent raids			1
last night @entity36 ’s mother @entity238 , looked distressed as she answered the door at her home near @entity241			0
she said : ‘ i have n’t spoken to him			0
i ca n’t say anything at the moment			0
’ a friend of @entity1 said : ‘ everyone is putting their faith in the @entity248 that they can sort the situation out			2
’ @entity21 police allegedly found 30kilos of cocaine on the @entity116			0
cocaine has a street value of around £ 50 a gram meaning the haul could be worth £ 1.5million			0
however the drug is likely to be pure because it has come direct from @entity257 meaning it could be cut doubling its street value to £ 3million			0
the @entity248 said it was providing consular assistance .			0

@entity19 detained *alongside* two other @entity25 over 30kg bust
37 - year - old 's father @entity1 is musician @entity4 's brother
