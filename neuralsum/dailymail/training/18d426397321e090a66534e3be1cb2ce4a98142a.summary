the big freeze will turn into a deep freeze tomorrow as temperatures hurtle down to @entity3 in parts of rural @entity6			2
it came as forecasters put out weather warnings for ice and snow across the country , predicting the arrival of snow in @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 by thursday			2
residents affected by last week ’s floods were also warned to expect around an inch of @entity22 flood alerts were issued for the @entity23 and @entity24 alone			0
‘ we could also see some snow flurries and wintry showers over northern parts of @entity53 and @entity54			1
' temperatures will only get up to about @entity56 ( @entity57 ) and we also have a big ice warning for @entity54 and the @entity23			2
‘ we also have a band of rain moving in from the @entity24 bringing up to 25mm ( nearly an inch ) in a short , sharp burst			0
‘ after the recent heavy rain there is a chance we could see some localised flooding and potentially hazardous driving conditions			0
‘ there will be widespread frosts and in the @entity70 we could see temperatures dip to possibly @entity3 ( 18f ) in rural locations overnight			0
’ many believe @entity6 could be heading towards one of the coldest winters on record			0
the conditions are being put down to high pressure over @entity38 , which has seen cold air tearing over @entity6 from the north - east and raising hopes for a white @entity81			1
shovelling snow : @entity83 clears the street outside his house @entity86 , @entity32 take care : @entity88 and rain has turned to slush , adding to the perilous conditions on the roads the @entity93 that heralded the start of december is set to continue , with sleet , snow and hail covering much of the country all week			1
the cold snap will persist , with temperatures dropping to a lower - than - average -8c in @entity30 and four inches of snow expected tomorrow , and another four inches likely later in the week			1
high pressure in @entity38 can indicate one of the most well - known snow setups , in which the pressure front moves from @entity37 into @entity38 , and then ridges westwards , giving the @entity39 a chilly easterly airflow			1
continental air from @entity109 is very cold and dry , but as this air passes over the @entity111 , it warms up and picks up moisture			1
this gives rise to layers of grey cloud and mostly dull dry weather , with a little drizzle or fine powdery snow for eastern areas			0
when the high pressure to our north is not particularly strong , or the airmass has a long track over the @entity111 , or there is a strong contrast between surface and upper - air temperatures , there may be enough instability in the atmosphere to produce cumulonimbus clouds			1
these can give rise to heavy prolonged snow showers for eastern @entity6 , and snow flurries for western @entity6			1
