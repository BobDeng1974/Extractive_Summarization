the group were given varying jail terms for their part in the scam but this week @entity16 was the subject of a hearing at @entity49 to recover some of the £ 1.5million cash he raked in			1
he was jailed for four years and eight months in 2011 for masterminding the con but was ordered to pay back £ 1,280,000 within six months or face an additional six years			1
the court heard the gang ran the bank accounts as if they were owned by real people , making transactions and paying in what looked like high salaries in order to build up good credit ratings			2
but they would then apply for an overdraft or loan and bleed the accounts dry , before moving on to other victims			0

he made around £ 2million from the fraud			2
different faces : @entity37 styled his hair differently and wore different glasses in a bid to fool the banks at @entity16 ’s office , police found a number of mobile phones all adorned with sticky notes giving the bogus names that the number belonged to			1
he also kept one cheque from each bank account so he had a template of the bogus signature he had used			0
@entity112 , 41 , who was a lieutenant in the con , stuffed folders in the oven so officers would not discover the bogus identity documents in his possession			0
