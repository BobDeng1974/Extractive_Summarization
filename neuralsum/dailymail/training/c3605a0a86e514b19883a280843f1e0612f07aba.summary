by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 will not be re-signing @entity3 this summer			2
the @entity5 striker spent last season on loan at @entity8 , where he top scored with 14 goals			0
manager @entity10 and the club ’s hierarchy made it clear to @entity3 and his representatives they wanted to sign him on a permanent deal , but the player had @entity19 aspirations			2
that triggered talk of a return to @entity38 but @entity10 has confirmed that @entity2 have moved on from their pursuit of the @entity41 international , and will instead bring in @entity43 ’s 23 - year - old forward @entity42 on a season - long loan deal			1
on the subject of @entity3 , the @entity2 boss told @entity2 : ‘ i think he ’s had plenty of chances to come to us			0
‘ we made it very clear that we would like to have him and it has n’t really happened and therefore sometimes you have to say where ’s the line drawn for us as a club as we have our own respect and our own professionalism			0
new man : @entity42 ( right ) will join @entity2 on a season - long loan deal from @entity43 moving on : @entity10 will sign @entity42 from @entity62 instead of @entity3 ‘ so maybe that one has gone away but like all transfers they ’re never , ever over so we ’ll keep our finger on the pulse			1
’ @entity2 , meanwhile , face @entity68 in the @entity69 on saturday afternoon where they will be without summer signing @entity70 who has a calf injury			1
@entity74 internationals @entity72 and @entity75 have travelled with the squad to @entity77 but will not feature .			0
