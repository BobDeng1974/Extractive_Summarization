by @entity0 published : 09:30 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 03:21 est , 12 december 2012 a judge took pity on a 74 - year - old man who grew cannabis to pay for a drugs rehabilitation course for his addict son			1
desperate @entity6 grew seven plants worth £ 12,000 in a small bedroom at his home in @entity10			1
the former oil - rig worker planned to sell the plants to raise cash to pay for his son to undergo rehabilitation			1
@entity6 , left , grew cannabis at his home near @entity19 , right , to send his son to rehab @entity6 was facing from six months to three years in prison as a ' significant ' producer of the class b drug under current sentencing guidelines			1
but judge @entity24 , sitting at @entity25 , said he was suspending the jail term because @entity6 ' son was having difficulties and he ' just wanted to put him on the straight and narrow			1
' police officers were called to @entity6 ' address after a strong smell of cannabis was reported coming from the property			2
gardener and former allotment holder @entity6 took the officers upstairs to the bedroom and they found a sophisticated growing set - up with seven plants			1
the estimated yield of 398 grammes would have been worth £ 12,000 on the streets			1
@entity42 , prosecuting , said after his arrest @entity6 was ' brutally frank ' with the police			2
illegal crop : @entity6 said growing the drugs was ' as easy as growing tomatoes ' but guaranteed the judge it would never happen again mr @entity42 said : ' he denied taking cannabis and said he was growing it commercially so he could pay for his son , rather ironically , to receive private access to a rehab clinic			1
' it was a commercial enterprise and he was a " significant " grower towards the lower end of the sentencing guidelines			0
the former oil rig worker said he believed the plants were only worth between £ 2,000 and £ 3,000 and he got the idea to grow cannabis from a fellow gardener			1
he had not even worked out how he would sell the plants or find someone to buy them			0
@entity66 @entity25 : judge @entity24 said @entity6 just wanted to put his son ' on the straight and narrow ' @entity6 , of @entity68 , @entity67 admitted producing a class b controlled drug on august 7			1
judge @entity71 told the court : ' it clearly crosses the custody threshold			0
can i suspend it ? the answer is " yes "			0
' he said @entity6 was growing cannabis to sell but he fully accepted it was for the benefit of his drug - ravaged son			1
' growing cannabis albeit on a relatively small scale always attracts a prison sentence , ' the judge told him			0
' what i have had to decide is whether to suspend it in your case			0
i have decided the right thing is to do so			0
' he gave @entity6 a six - month jail term suspended for a year and told him : ' as long as you do n't commit any further offences you wo n't hear any more of it			1
' the judge ordered the confiscation and destruction of the drug - growing equipment and plants			2
@entity6 , who was wearing a suit and tie replied : ' it 's all gone , @entity106 , thank you very much			2
' after the hearing all he would say was : ' they told me it was a funny idea but it was the right idea if you know my son			0
i am highly satisfied with the verdict and i can guarantee it will never happen again			0
' no details were given in court about his son or his drug problems			2
but @entity6 explained after an earlier court hearing : ' you tell me any parent who sees their son suffering who would not do just about anything to help them			2
' i used to work in @entity130 and was offered cannabis to smoke and said " no "			0
now i 'm being branded as some sort of drug dealer			0
' they said the plants i grew had a value of almost £ 12,000 just from a packet of seeds ? all i wanted was to make £ 2,500 to get my son into rehab because he has a serious drugs problem			1
' are they telling me those plants are worth all that money ? to be honest it was as easy growing them as tomatoes			0
i 'm no drug dealer and when the police came to the house and took them away i did n't think i had anything to worry about			0
' when the letter arrived saying i had to go to court and i learned what i was charged with i was gobsmacked			0

@entity6 grew plants worth £ 12,000 from seed in @entity10 home
he hoped to raise £ 2,500 to pay for rehab for his drug addict son
judge @entity24 said letting him off jail was ' the right thing to do '
