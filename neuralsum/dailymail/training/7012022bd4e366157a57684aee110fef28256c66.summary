hot stuff : the @entity1 packs 250,000 @entity2 vodka fans with an adventurous side can add a bit of spice to their lives as master of malt launches the world ’s hottest chilli vodka			2
at 250,000 on the @entity12 scale , the new @entity1 is so hot it comes with a special health warning			1
its launch comes just months after the company released the 100,000 @entity16			2
the new version is 2.5 times hotter			2
the chilli used in the vodka is the @entity20 , which is known to be one of the hottest chillis it is possible to grow , and rates higher on the @entity12 scale than most law - enforcement grade pepper sprays			1
each @entity12 unit denotes how many times the chilli must be diluted by its own mass of water until the heat is only just detectable			1
a jalapeno has an estimated 5,000 scovilles			2
the @entity20 can exceed 1,000,000 @entity2			1
the drink is made by fermenting litres of vodka with 18kg of the fiery peppers			1
the potent chillis are infused in large vodka - filled carboys for many weeks before bottling , and the bottlers must wear gas masks and rubber gloves when handling the chillis and final vodka to protect their skin , eyes , noses , and lungs			1
the resulting concoction is left for several weeks to infuse , and once the vodka has turned a dark caramel colour , the infusion is complete and the vodka can be bottled			0
the drink is recommended as a mixer , with expert mixologists suggesting it can be used in a classic @entity57 for a drink with extra kick			0
dangerous : the @entity20 chilli is fiercely hot and can be hazardous if ingested raw or unprocessed the 250,000 @entity2 - @entity1 will be available from 2 october at www.masterofmalt.com and costs £ 31.95 for 50cl			1
' i was blasé when the small , sinister - looking bottle of @entity1 vodka landed on my desk			0
sure , it was made of the formidable @entity20 chilli - known to be one of the world ’s hottest – and it promised to pack a palate - scorching 250,000 @entity2 - but i did n’t believe it could pose too much of a problem			1
' i love hot stuff – i lived in @entity76 , the @entity77 birthplace of the @entity79 chilli , in my twenties and thought i ’d battle - hardened my palate against scorching hot peppers with 14 months of regular chilli - chomping			2
' i am as addicted to a regular hit of capsaicin as others are to nicotine , and i have eaten enough limp chilli sauces claiming to be straight out of @entity96 ’s you - know - what that have not raised as much as a tingle that i take marketing spin with a very large pinch of salt			0
' this time though , the product met up to its promise			0
one capful of the stuff had my eyes bulging out of my head			0
my gums were on fire , my tongue felt like it had been stung by a thousand ants and my lips felt like they ’d doubled in size ... i loved it			0
' rest assured , this initial pain does n’t last long			0
five minutes later the fierce sting subsided and i was left with nothing more than that pleasant warm tingle that had me reaching for a second hit			0
