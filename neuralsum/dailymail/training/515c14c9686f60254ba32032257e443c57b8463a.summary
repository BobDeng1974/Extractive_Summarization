a plane flying from @entity1 to @entity2 had to make an emergency landing on a @entity5 island when a woman gave birth in business class			1
@entity9 , who turned 31 today , went into labour at 36,000 feet while flying from her home town of @entity14 , @entity1 's capital , to @entity15 , despite only being 26 weeks pregnant			1
the pilot of the @entity18 flight was forced to make an emergency landing in @entity20 , in the @entity21 , where the mother and baby , who has been called @entity24 , were rushed to the island 's @entity26 hospital			1
mrs @entity29 said : ' i do n't have any other option than to stay here on the island			1
my baby needs me to just hang in there for him until it is safe for him to come home with me			0
' the mother - of - two was travelling with her one - year - old daughter @entity54 and was planning to catch a connecting flight from @entity2 to @entity56 , @entity57 , where she was taking the little girl for vacation			1
@entity54 was born in the @entity57 but mrs @entity29 is insistent she was not retuning the country to have @entity61			2
she said : ' i was going for the summer , @entity24 was not due until august , there is no way i would be able to stay in the @entity57 until august			0
i had a return ticket to @entity1 booked for may 28 , so i intended to stay for a few weeks and then go home			1
' when her water broke , fellow passengers alerted the cabin crew who put out a call for doctors over the intercom			0
a female doctor , currently unidentified , was onboard and able to oversee the birth with the help of flight crew , who are trained in birthing procedures			2
at first , the housewife at first refused to believe she had gone into labour so early			0
it used to be the case that a baby born on board a @entity84 ship or aircraft would automatically get @entity84 citizenship			0
this was based on a @entity91 directive aimed at minimising the number of people in the world without a registered state			0
however , the @entity96 1981 , stated that any such baby , born after january 1 , 1983 , would not be granted @entity84 citizenship unless at least one parent already held it			0
mrs @entity29 said : ' i just was n't thinking that i could be in labour , i could n't imagine it			1
when the doctor told me that the baby was coming i went into total shock , i ca n't really remember , i was n't able to think clearly			0
' once the plane had touched down , mother and baby were raced to hospital where they are stable			1
mrs @entity29 said : ' i am fine and healthy and the doctor said that @entity24 is doing pretty well , that it 's looking good and he is trying to survive			2
' her husband , @entity113 , a local businessman in @entity1 , is now scurrying to get a visa so he can travel to be with his wife and children			2
mrs @entity29 said she had never thought the baby would come so early , or would not have attempted travelling			2
@entity29 and baby @entity24 was rushed to hospital after the plane landed on the island of @entity34 , pictured			1
@entity24 is currently in the @entity122 and will be kept in hospital until august she said : ' right now , [ mr @entity124 ] does n't have a @entity5 visa but i need him to come here			0
i do n't know what i 'm going to do when i get out of the hospital , i 'm completely in the dark			0
i need my husband because i do n't know the next step to take			0
' under @entity18 regulations , pregnant woman can fly on their planes until the end of their 36th week , or 32nd week if carrying more than one baby			1
once the emergency was dealt with , the plane continued on to the @entity84 , arriving only thirty minutes late			1
a spokesman for @entity18 said : ' our cabin crew , who are trained in birthing procedures , assisted with the delivery of a baby on board our flight from @entity14			1
' the captain diverted the aircraft to @entity34 so that mum and baby could be taken to hospital			2
' we are in touch and will continue to provide any support and help we can			0
' we wish the mother and her little one all the very best			0

@entity29 , 31 , went into labour at only 26 weeks pregnant while on a @entity18 flight from @entity1 to @entity2
the plane made an emergency landing on the island of @entity34 so the woman and *newborn* could receive medical attention
they both remain in hospital but are stable
