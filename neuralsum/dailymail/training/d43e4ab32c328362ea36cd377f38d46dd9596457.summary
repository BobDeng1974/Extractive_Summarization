by @entity0 published : 05:11 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 05:33 est , 29 august 2013 @entity1 is describing the ' hell ' she endured before she had her controversial £ 5,000 tummy tuck on the @entity4 when her mobile phone rings			1
no regrets : @entity1 says her @entity4 tummy tuck , which took her down a dress size , has made her confident it ’s a radio station wanting to interview the 27 - year - old single mum - of - three about the operation			1
would she be free for a chat on air tonight ? ' you ’ll have to speak to my agent , ' says the part - time beauty consultant , reeling off the contact details before hanging up and rolling her eyes in mock indignation			1
' it ’s all gone a bit mad , ' she giggles			1
the thousands on waiting lists for life - saving @entity4 treatment will certainly agree			1
the taxpayer , too , may wonder who in their right mind would sanction a wannabe actress having a state - funded operation because a saggy stomach was affecting her chances of stardom			1
@entity1 , of @entity34 , @entity35 , is unrepentant			1
the slim brunette , who wants to be the next @entity37 , says she needed the operation because it was affecting her confidence			1
what ’s more , she believes it saved the @entity4 money because she will not now need treatment for depression			1
yes , you heard that right			1
' as a long - term patient because i was so depressed , the @entity4 would have probably ended up spending more money on my medication , ' she says			1
perhaps the truly depressing aspect of this tale is its familiarity			1
@entity1 ’s story closely resembles that of @entity56 , a 23 - year - old wannabe model , who had breast enlargement surgery that cost the @entity4 £ 4,800			1
five months later , she decided she did n’t like her new breasts and wanted them reducing — also at the taxpayers ’ expense			1
with an astonishing lack of self - awareness , @entity56 has hit out at @entity1 for wasting taxpayers ’ money , while insisting her own operation was justified			1
' i ’m not going to apologise , ' @entity1 says at the three - bedroom home she shares with her children , @entity70 , six , @entity71 , four , and two - year - old @entity72			1
she separated from their father , who she will only name as @entity76 , 12 months ago after seven years together			1
he is helping to look after the children today			2
' i do n’t make the decisions about who does and does not get surgery — that ’s up to the doctors and surgeons			2
it ’s not my fault if people with other conditions are n’t treated properly , ' she says			2
‘ it has been really hard for me			2
i felt so self - conscious			2
friends would ask me to go out and i ’d say no because i could n’t find clothes to fit			2
i could only get into a size ten [ she ’s now a size eight ]			2
' i had no confidence			2
i did n’t feel comfortable getting undressed in front of @entity76 , and i felt too self - conscious to have sex with him			2
uncomfortable : @entity1 ( right ) was left embarrassed and unhappy by her size 10 post-baby figure controversial : @entity1 's decision caused a media furore but she remains unrepentant ' other people said my stomach did n’t look too bad , but i thought it looked awful			1
people asked me how far on i was with my pregnancy when i was n’t even pregnant			2
' feeling embarrassed by a post-pregnancy muffin top is something thousands of mothers will relate to , but few will resort to anything as drastic as a tummy tuck			1
even then , most would expect to pay for it privately			2
@entity1 says this was never an option			1
on her £ 7,000 salary plus child benefits and working tax credits , it would , she says , have ' taken years ' to save up			2
instead , the @entity4 stepped in			1
' i did n’t even know an op would help me until the doctor referred me to a surgeon , ' she says			2
@entity1 ’s mother passed away at the age of 52			1
she claims her council worker father and three brothers and two sisters support her decision to have surgery			2
' my family know how badly it affected my confidence , ' she says			2
@entity1 left school at 16 with ten gcses , but dropped out of college and became a waitress			1
she gave that up when she got pregnant with her daughter , aged 21			2
now , like so many of @entity143 generation who think a large cleavage and flat stomach are the route to success regardless of talent , @entity1 has big plans			1
' my ambition is to write and perform my own songs , ' she says			2
' i ’d like to be the next @entity153			0
i did drama and singing at school and won competitions			0
i auditioned for @entity143 in 2008 , but i did n’t get through			0
' after i had my children i gave up my dream			0
now ? i ’d like to take acting and singing lessons — i really may be the next @entity37 ! ' @entity1 first noticed the changes in her body after the birth of her first child			1
' i knew when i had @entity70 my body would change , but i did n’t realise how much			0
' i remember lying in the bath after i ’d had her and my tummy looked lumpy			1
i thought it would get better with time , but it did n’t			0
i tried to get rid of it by going to the gym three times a week , but it made no difference			0
' she says : ' it was only after i ’d had @entity72 that my midwife said my stomach muscles had separated and i might need to see the gp			0
i had backache because my stomach muscles were n’t supporting me			0
i visited my gp several times and told him i felt very low			0
it was affecting my social life , too			0
' outrage : aspiring model @entity56 caused controversy when she had a boob job on the @entity4 looking at pictures of @entity1 ’s stomach before surgery , it is difficult to see what she is complaining about			1
having given birth to twins a year ago , i would be very happy to swap figures			0
@entity1 ’s @entity179 referred her to a physiotherapist , who gave her exercises to improve her posture			1
' for a while they helped my backache , but when i asked her if they would help pull my muscles back into shape , she said no. i would need surgery for that			0
' when i looked in the mirror i just saw a fat belly and loose skin			0
i wore looser clothing to cover it , but underneath i felt ugly			0
the doctors referred me to a surgeon , but i did n’t think i ’d get it free			0
' @entity1 was sent to the @entity212 , where it was agreed she would have a tummy tuck on the @entity4			1
a spokesperson for @entity216 said they would not comment on individual cases , adding : ' decisions to fund treatments are made after extensive inquiries with the patient ’s gp and through careful and sympathetic discussion of all the available facts			0
' ' i was terrified in the weeks leading up to the operation , ' says @entity1			1
' i wondered what would happen if i did n’t wake up			0
i did n’t want to leave my children without their mum			0
' but then i thought that in the long term the children would benefit because they ’d have a much happier mum			0
' the three - hour operation to remove excess skin from @entity1 ’s stomach went ahead on july 23 , and she says the boost to her confidence was immediate			1
' as soon as i got undressed for the first time , i felt so much better about my body , ' she says			0
' the surgeon , who had made a vertical cut around four inches long up to my belly button , said the operation had gone well			0
people might wonder why i ’m not self - conscious about having a big scar since i was self - conscious about a big tummy , but at least underwear can cover a scar			1
' @entity1 says the operation has ' transformed ' her life , and believes nothing stands between her and her new career			1
she has already made her tv debut			0
' i was on the @entity254 show a few years ago , but i do n’t really want to talk about why , ' she says			0
' i ’m going on @entity255 , too — i ’d like to do more tv			0
i ’ve not been offered any modelling and i ’ve got quite a few tattoos , so i do n’t know if that would be possible			0
but if the chance came along to do something classy — not topless — i ’d think about it			0
' celebrities have such glamorous lives			0
they can buy whatever they want			0
it ca n’t be all it ’s cracked up to be , though			0
i ’ve only been famous for five minutes and am already getting loads of calls			0
it ’s been a bit of a nightmare			0
' and the radio interview ? ' do n’t know if i can be bothered , ' she says			0
' i ’ve got a party to go to			0
' and a flat tummy to show off — paid for , dear reader , by you .			1
