by @entity1 reporter published : 12:31 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 14:21 est , 8 january 2014 @entity3 and @entity4 are the latest countries to legislate against so - called ' revenge porn '			1
both nations have passed laws that specifically make the sharing of intimate imagery , texts or videos of an ex-partner with the intent to cause harm or distress illegal			0
they are the latest governments to address the worryingly common phenomenon , which sees previous partners or lovers maliciously post private intimate content online to shame or embarrass their ex. revenge porn : some may live to regret posing for pictures with their partner as they could be posted on the internet if the relationship turns sour ( posed by models ) in @entity4 the law was introduced to the @entity31 by member @entity32 who said : ' we are witnessing more and more cases of sexual assaults that were filmed and distributed in public without restraint and without limits ; this legislative intervention is necessary and will help fight the shocking phenomenon of ' virtual rape , ' @entity42 reports			1
meanwhile the @entity3 state of @entity44 has made it an offence to distribute , or even threaten to distribute such images			0
revenge porn often sees the victim named , with personal information such as place of work , parents phone number or boss 's email , being shared alongside the photo and vile hateful messages from their ex. victims are often horrified to learn that , as well as the humiliation of highly personal information , meant for their partner 's eyes only , being splashed online , that they will likely struggle to bring the perpetrator to justice , or even to get the images taken down			1
violation : revenge porn often sees the victim named , with personal information such as place of work , parents phone number or boss 's email , being shared alongside the photo and vile hateful messages from their ex there are also reports of a victim 's photo being obtained through their own , or their ex 's computer being hacked rather than being submitted , or even of a victim 's face being photoshopped onto pornographic images , when they have never been photographed nude			2
@entity82 currently has no law to explicitly make posting revenge porn illegal , though a charge may still be brought under existing harassment laws or other communications laws			1
in part , the worldwide lack of proper guidelines and laws is due to the difficultly faced in drawing legal boundaries			1
if the partner took the footage or image then the copyright is theirs , and a website is not responsible for content given by others unless it is child pornography			0
many revenge porn sites appallingly cash in on the lack of policing and will charge victims to take their photos down			1
difficulty drawing legal boundaries : whoever takes the picture owns the copyright ( posed by models ) in @entity112 , where some anti-revenge porn legislation has been passed ( the law does not cover any material taken by the subject themselves such as ' selfies ' ) a website owner has just been arrested after extorting his victims out of thousands of dollars			1
@entity120 has been charged with 31 offences pertaining to the publishing of 10,000 explicit photos that were sent in to a revenge porn website he ran			1
and while it may be easy to dismiss revenge porn as a side - line issue , research from the @entity130 recently showed that more than half ( 52.3 per cent ) of young adults have engaged in ' unwanted but consensual sexting with a committed partner			2
' arrested : @entity120 , seen here with an unidentified woman , faces 31 charges relating to his operation of a revenge porn site and sister extortion campaign by this they mean that while the person was not forced to send the text or image , they felt pressurised into it , perhaps by peer pressure or anxieties over the relationship , with women being more susceptible than men			2
a few victims have raised the profile of the issue such as dr. @entity156 whose ex 's campaign resulted in her having to change her name before becoming an activist against revenge porn			2
revenge porn sites have come under legal scrutiny as more and more disgruntled exes decide to publicly share intimate photos of former lovers in an effort to shame them			1
law enforcement officials have been stumped on how to respond to revenge porn			2
website operators are n't liable for content provided by others , unless the images are child pornography			0
anti-harassment and cyberstalking laws do n't apply unless the ex-partner threatens the victim or attempts repeated contact			0
copyright protections would n't help because often the victim was n't the one who took the photos			0
suing for civil damages is another option , but that , means hefty legal bills and the risk of provoking an unstable ex-partner			0
@entity112 and @entity190 passed specific laws criminalizing revenge porn - while others including @entity194 are considering a change in legislation			0
in @entity112 spurned lovers who post graphic images of ex face prison sentence while those convicted of malicious intent could also be fined $ 1,000			0
@entity3 and @entity4 are the latest countries to pass laws .			0

@entity44 and @entity4 first to legislate against ' revenge porn '

@entity82 currently has no law to explicitly make it illegal
