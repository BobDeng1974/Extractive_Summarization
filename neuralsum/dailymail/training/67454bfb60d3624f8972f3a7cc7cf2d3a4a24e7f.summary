@entity7 , 37 , had a severe allergic reaction to the tattoo on her ankle			1
it became bumpy before breaking out into a large , excruciatingly painful growth			1
@entity7 , 37 , suffered a severe allergic reaction to the red dye in a love heart tattoo she had in honour of her daughter , @entity16			1
she has been left with a permanent scar on her ankle her allergy to the tattoo ’s red ink was confirmed by doctors after the growth , which had become so large that it prevented her from wearing boots , was surgically removed			1
she said : ‘ i kept using antiseptic cream like i was told , and prayed the swelling would go down , but it did n’t			0
‘ i thought it was a mysterious reaction which would go away eventually , but it got to the point where i could n’t bear it any more			0
even just to touch it was really painful			2
’ miss @entity7 and her partner of 17 years @entity35 chose to get tattoos as permanent expressions of love for their seven - year - old daughter , @entity16			1
mr @entity35 , 37 , a heating engineer , elected to have @entity16 ’s name tattooed on his back , while @entity43 , an accountant , chose a small heart - shaped design on her right ankle – it was her first tattoo			1
she said : ‘ i ’d always wanted a tattoo and i like the heart image			2
i wanted it done for my daughter because i knew she would like it			2
shortly after the tattoo was completed , ms @entity7 noticed it was turning ' bumpy ' ( pictured ) ms @entity7 's tattoo turned into a protruding and extremely painful growth which was so big she could not wear boots			1
she was forced to turn to her doctor for help and was referred to @entity58 ‘ getting the tattoo done was n’t particularly painful			1
i managed to keep chatting while the tattoo artist worked			2
‘ at first it was fine			0
but then , six weeks later , i noticed that the tattoo was bumpy and the red colour was fading			1
‘ i went back to the tattooist to ask his opinion , and he said he would be happy to top up the colour when the bumps went down			0
he advised using antiseptic cream			0
‘ but the weeks went on and it got worse			0
i tried to ignore it , but it got to the point where i could n’t think of anything else			0
i could n’t wear proper footwear and i could n’t sleep on it			0
’ ms @entity7 had surgery to remove the growth ( left ) but was left with an open wound ( right ) which became infected			1
she had to spend two days in hospital while she fought the infection eventually miss @entity7 , of @entity82 , @entity83 , went to see a doctor			1
in june 2013 , 11 months after she had the tattoo done , she was referred to @entity58 in central @entity83 where specialists were able to remove the flaky growth , which was by now protruding from her ankle			1
she said : ‘ the dermatologists took one look at it and were shocked			0
they ’d never seen an allergic reaction like it before			0
they took pictures which they wanted to use for a report in a medical journal			0
‘ the surgeon who removed the growth tried to make it so the scar was heart - shaped			1
she said , “ @entity7 wanted a heart , so let ’s try and give her a heart ”			2
they looked after me really well			0
’ ms @entity7 has been left with a permanent scar on her ankle ( pictured ) but , despite her ordeal , decided to have another tattoo - this time she had one which did not require red ink unfortunately , the wound took longer than anticipated to heal and a month after the operation @entity43 spent two days in hospital fighting an infection			1
she said : ‘ when i had the operation they had to leave me with an open wound			0
they could n’t do skin grafts because of the position of nerves and a nearby artery			0
i needed to change the dressings constantly			0
’ she is now left with a four centimetre scar on her ankle			1
she said : ‘ i ’ve had another tattoo done of my daughter ’s name in black ink on my neck and i ’ve never had any problems with it			2
‘ they ’re still not sure what it was in the red ink which caused the allergic reaction			2
it might have been a metallic chemical			0
my ankle ’s still not perfectly healed , but i ’m glad the growth has gone			2

@entity7 got tattoo on her ankle as a sign of her love for her daughter
it became ' bumpy ' and then turned into a large , excruciatingly painful growth
doctors believe she was allergic to the red dye used for the tattoo
she had to have the growth surgically removed and developed an infection after the operation - she has been left with a *4cm* scar on her ankle
