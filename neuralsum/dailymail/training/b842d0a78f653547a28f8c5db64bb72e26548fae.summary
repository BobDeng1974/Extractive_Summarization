when @entity2 arrives in @entity3 next wednesday , diehard republicans will no doubt ­ protest that he is just ­ another over-privileged royal with no more right to reign over them in the future than a kangaroo			1
but , as i have discovered , the little ­ fellow has rather more in common with the ­ average @entity10 than any of them could suspect			2
for i can reveal that through a horny - handed , sheep - ­ stealing ancestor , he is related to hundreds , ­ possibly ­ thousands , of modern @entity10			1
thanks to his grandmother , @entity16 , the eight - month - old @entity2 can trace his roots to a 19th - century farm labourer from @entity20 , who was found guilty of stealing three lambs and handed the obligatory sentence — transportation to @entity25			1
will @entity27 's blood link to @entity29 help in the @entity31 ¿ s continuing ­ battle against the republican ­ movement there ? surely this new - found blood link will help in the @entity31 ’s continuing ­ battle against the republican ­ movement , which maintains a powerful voice in the country and wants a head of state who is @entity10 and who lives in the country			1
it will also , perhaps , strengthen the arguments of those who support the idea of prince @entity45 becoming ­ governor - general of australia when the incumbent sir @entity47 retires in five years			2
@entity2 ’s ties to some of those who will flock to see him next week are the result of a human drama which , in microcosm , tells the story of the ­ forging of @entity25 itself			1
after transportation from @entity20 , farm labourer @entity56 started his new life in the young nation , breaking rocks as a member of a chain - gang			1
it would take ten years to win his freedom			2
@entity56 had a son , @entity65 , who ­ married @entity66 , ­ @entity67 ’s great - great - great aunt			2
that name has survived the many decades in between to be borne by the @entity70 ’s uncle , @entity71			2
( though he has never been accused of stealing sheep , he attracted a certain infamy when he was exposed as ­ having offered cocaine and prostitutes to a reporter at his @entity79 villa , @entity80			1
) over subsequent years , the @entity83 family ’s descendants spread through every state of @entity25			1
it had been in december 1839 that @entity56 and his brother , @entity86 , were arrested on the @entity88 ­ railway and accused of stealing the three lambs			1
the brothers were no better and no worse than many ­ members of the 19th century underclass , ­ suffering a combination of insufficient work , poor health , undernourishment and the withering effects of the @entity98			2
both had been to jail and the workhouse			2
@entity102 , is @entity27 's ancestor			1
she married @entity103 , son of @entity56 of course , they were breaking the law , but , for them , it was the only way of feeding their starving families			2
@entity56 had four children by two wives , but both women had died			2
with farm work hard to find , he had twice placed the children in the @entity116 poor house			1
he and his brother @entity117 served short jail terms for vagrancy , but , in their defence , the pair were the last to be chosen for any work because they were not able to read or write			2
when the @entity126 were arrested , they were at the end of their tether			2
they appeared at @entity129 on january 2 , 1840 , and an open - and - shut case was put to the judge			2
the brothers had stolen the lambs and the remains of the meat had been found in their houses			1
the ­ prosecution , determined to get a conviction , @entity137 produced the lambskins and the ­ evidence of two local butchers			2
@entity86 , of ‘ a notoriously bad ­ character ’ , was sentenced to be ­ transported for life			0
his younger brother @entity56 was sentenced to ten years ’ transportation			0
but , ­ effectively , that meant a life ­ sentence — because convicts were not given a return ticket at the end of their sentence and rarely raised enough money to buy one			1
so , for the theft of three lambs , the @entity56 brothers were shipped to the other side of the world — @entity162 ’s land , now @entity163 — with no hope of return			1
the 101 - day journey across the high seas on the prison ship @entity169 was a ­ living hell , and the brothers stepped ashore with great relief			0
but @entity56 would spend the next ten years working on a chain - gang , breaking rocks and helping prepare roads on the island , 150 miles from the @entity10 mainland			0
there was never any hope of escape			0
while little is known of @entity86 ’s fate , the gruelling punishment did not break @entity56 — far from it			0
just over eight years after his ­ conviction , he received a conditional pardon and was subsequently released			0
in a ­ bullish mood , he sailed to @entity25 , where he met up with one of his four sons , @entity65			1
he had been just 15 years old when he had last seen his father			0
he ’d pledged to meet up with him again and start a new life in the ­ emerging country , and so took his young bride , @entity193 , whom he ’d met in @entity20 where her family were the @entity196 ’ neighbours			0
even in the fetid steerage cabins , the journey aboard the migrant ship @entity200 , accompanied by its sister - ship named — appropriately , you might say — @entity27 , was more luxurious by far for the newlyweds than it had been for @entity205			1
the couple arrived in @entity207 on september 9 , 1850 , and prepared themselves for an exhausting trip across the vast continent to @entity211			1
the family tree , which @entity27 can trace back her @entity10 roots			1
@entity214 visits @entity3 next week @entity66 was tall , dark and willowy			1
however , the marriage was not to last beyond its fifth year for , after producing three children , the youngest of whom was to rise to become a member of parliament , @entity66 died			0
the @entity196 — @entity56 ; his son @entity65 ; and @entity65 ’s son , @entity221 — steeled themselves for rough times ahead			0
on his release , @entity56 worked as a labourer , while his son @entity65 sweated it out in the local brickworks at @entity229 , near @entity230			1
the men were hard and they were ambitious			0
when the @entity232 began , all three travelled 300 miles south - west overland from @entity229 to @entity234 , near @entity235 , in the ­ @entity237 goldfields where father and son set to work all hours as ­ miners , labourers and brickmakers			0
at the age of 72 , after years of being toughened on the chain - gang , it is recorded that @entity56 was still hard at work , helping build the ­ family fortune — but his had been a supremely tough life and he died soon after			0
his son @entity65 and grandson @entity221 moved to @entity251 , in ­ @entity237 , where the rewards of their hard labour allowed them to buy a farm and set up a brick - making business			1
eventually , @entity221 became a successful building and roads ­ contractor — and the @entity56 family was on its way			0
forty years after his grandfather had left ­ @entity264 in chains , @entity221 was poised to become the mp for @entity267			0
his mother , @entity66 , had died soon after he was born , but her name lived on in his first child , whom he named @entity66			0
@entity27 's links to @entity25 can be traced through her mother @entity67 a portrait survives of this @entity274 , pleasingly for ­ @entity10 , is ­ strikingly similar to her kinswoman , the @entity275 of @entity276			1
so , what of the @entity279 who remained in @entity264 ? the carpenter father of the @entity66 who had sailed to @entity25 hated the shame brought upon the family by his daughter ­ marrying the son of a sheep - stealer			1
@entity66 ’s brother , @entity286 , meanwhile , was little more than a labourer and brickmaker for most of his life			1
his son , also @entity286 , did the same — as did the next generation ’s male ­ progeny , @entity293			0
for a century , while the @entity196 slaved away to improve their fortunes in @entity25 , the @entity279 trod water socially and professionally			1
only when @entity293 ’s son , @entity297 , broke the mould by becoming an engineer and builder did things begin to look up			0
@entity297 ’s ­ marriage to @entity302 , the decidedly upwardly mobile daughter of a miner from @entity304 , sparked a further move up the social ladder			0
it was an upward trajectory that ’s ended with the extraordinary achievements of their daughter , ­ @entity67 , in producing a daughter who has become mother to the future king of @entity313 and @entity25			1
while the @entity279 were ­ making their way in the world , down under the @entity56 clan had grown fast			0
@entity317 — ­ grandson of the convict @entity56 — and his wife @entity320 had 12 ­ children , and it ’s the numerous descendants of this couple — and those of his sisters , @entity327 and @entity328 , who make up the nucleus of what may wryly be dubbed ‘ the @entity331 ’			0
these three siblings — @entity221 , @entity327 and @entity328 — were @entity2 ’s first cousins , five times removed			0
though with each generation the cousinage becomes watered down , ­ descendants of these three @entity196 have a right to claim kinship with the future king			0
today , they range from blue - ­ collar workers through middle - class ­ professionals to such well - known @entity10 figures as @entity345 , an mp for @entity347 , and it multi-millionaire @entity348			0
so , next week — though he wo n’t know it — @entity2 will be among his people , his relatives			2
support for the monarchy @entity355 is at a 25 - year high , and his presence will surely help the ­ royals ’ efforts to nurture the link between themselves and those we can now quite rightly call their @entity10 cousins			0
who knows , one day @entity2 might get to meet all those rellies round the barbie .			0

@entity214 can trace roots to farm labourer who was sent to @entity25
he was found guilty of stealing three lambs and handed the sentence
@entity27 is *due* in @entity3 next week as part of trip to @entity25 and @entity377
