three large solar flares over the last two days have released a huge cloud of particles from the sun which could knock out satellites and communication systems on @entity6			1
a ' coronal mass ejection ' ( @entity8 ) , a huge cloud of irradiated particles and a magnetic shockwave , could strike the planet on friday , damaging satellites and knocking out communications			1
the three solar flares already caused brief disruptions to high frequency communications , such as radio broadcasts and aircraft communications , when they struck yesterday and twice on tuesday			1
two on tuesday ( left and centre ) and one on wednesday ( right ) , disrupting military radio and aircraft communications the sun emitted two @entity29 solar flares on tuesday morning at 7.42am and 8.52am - @entity30 being the most powerful kind of solar flare - and a third @entity34 flare early yesterday			1
solar flares are largely harmless , as @entity6 's atmosphere absorbs most of the harmful particles they emit			2
however they can cause satellites to malfunction , and disrupt the layer of atmosphere some communications pass through , causing interruptions			0
but if the @entity8 strikes , then the damage could be far more severe			0
@entity8 's can cause huge electrical surges , knocking out power grids and causing pylon cables to overload and snap			0
events on this scale are unlikely , as the @entity52 says the @entity8 due on friday will only strike a ' glancing blow ' , but satellites could be affected , leading to a drop in mobile phone signal			2
the last major @entity8 to hit @entity6 came in 1859 when compasses were knocked out as @entity6 's magnetic field was disrupted			2
but the flares also released a ' coronal mass ejection ' , a huge cloud of irradiated particles and a magnetic shockwave which could hit @entity6 on friday , potentially knocking out mobile phone satellites and gps the @entity66 was also visible as far south as @entity67 as particles from the sun bounced off of @entity6 's atmosphere			1
because the last major @entity8 happened before the planet was dependent on electronics for our day - to - day lives , little is known about what the real impact would be			0
but it is likely that large electronics would be badly affected , causing weeks or months of disruptions to power supplies , phone networks and the internet which could cost billions to repair			0
small electronics , such as mobile phones and computers , would likely be unaffected , but would be rendered almost useless with large networks knocked out			0
this image provided by @entity89 's @entity88 shows a significant solar flare erupting on 10 june 2014			0
the sun has emitted 3 x-class solar flares in two days , the most intense type of solar flares			1

three of the most intense class of solar flares released from sun in two days
caused disruption in aircraft communications and military radio in @entity104
also released huge magnetic shockwave which could hit @entity6 on friday
that could knock out mobile phone satellites and gps communications
