she refuses to cut it by the recommended amount because of the birds that nest in it miss @entity4 said : ' i would rather be given an asbo than kill the birds and the bats			1
' i will not cut them down because i do not want to destroy the pigeons which are nesting there and the bats which i see roosting in the branches			1
' the whole thing has been ridiculous , there needs to be some kind of inquiry into how these councils are acting			0
' i had someone come round last september , he had got most of the way through when he found a nest with some fledgling pigeons in it and we could n't do it legally			2
