by @entity0 a @entity2 employee says his company hires the absolute smartest people in the world and that it 's a pretty big problem			1
@entity7 , an engineer for @entity2 's broadband arm fiber based in @entity9 , blew the whistle on what he calls the staff 's overconfidence problem in a june 30 blog post he titled @entity15			1
' smart people have a problem , ' @entity7 writes , ' especially when you put them in large groups			1
that problem is an ability to convincingly rationalize nearly anything			0
' stop me if you 've heard this : @entity2 employees are over-confident computer geeks with poor social skills , says @entity2 employee @entity7 ( pictured ) @entity7 reasons that @entity2 snags its smart programmers straight out of college much of the time , giving the brilliant ' computer geek types ' to see how the real world works			1
' working at a large , successful company lets you keep your isolation , ' writes @entity7			2
' if you choose , you can just ignore all the inconvenient facts about the world			0
' @entity2 's problem is the opposite of other less elite companies where lack of confidence plagues workers , says @entity7			1
' the curse is confidence			0
it 's confidence that comes from a lifetime of success after real success , ' he writes			0
too confident ? @entity7 says that @entity48 could use a dose of self - doubt in order to foster the next great innovation so what 's the solution to confidence ? a blow to the ego , of course			2
@entity7 believes the genius masses at @entity2 need a dose of @entity62 lack of confidence			1

in the place of confidence , he says that @entity2 , it 's employees and its users would all benefit from some self doubt to help usher in that next great @entity2 product			2
