by @entity0 homophobic abuse is rampant in our schools with new research revealing that 80 percent of students experienced distressing comments in @entity8 classes			1
the beyondblue study found that casual comments such as ' you 're so gay ' , which may not have been intended to upset someone , were causing mental health problems in students with higher levels of depression and anxiety reported			2
the research led by @entity19 was based on 399 @entity21 secondary school students between the age of 14 and 22 and focused on young people who are gay , lesbian , bisexual and gender diverse			1
‘ it ’s part of this negative mirror about them being gay			0
it does n’t help them very much with their self - acceptance			0
’ apart from verbal homophobic abuse , the research also found that a quarter of young people in school pe lessons reported physical abuse and pushing			1
the survey also looked at the effect homophobic bullying has on students mental health , by comparing the levels of stress , anxiety and depression in the participants to a sample of 187 straight students			1
‘ the results showed severe ratings of depression among gay and lesbians were almost double of that of their counterparts , ’ says dr @entity34			2

’ chief executive officer of beyondblue , @entity105 , says their organisation is committed to finding out reasons for depression and preventing it			0
