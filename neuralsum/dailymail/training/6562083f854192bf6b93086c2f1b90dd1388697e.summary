however , the panel heard that , about an hour later , health care assistant @entity50 informed the nurse that she could not rouse the patient			2
mrs @entity0 said : ' i always felt that @entity50 was very timid and shy , so i assumed she was not shouting loudly enough to wake her			1
' i went to her room , but , because of our banter , i was half expecting her to open her eyes and say " fooled you ! " ' the nurse said she checked the patient 's eyes to see if her pupils were dilated and noticed her leg twitch			2
she said she believed the resident had suffered an epileptic fit and decided to put her to bed so she could ' sleep it off '			1
she told the panel she visited her again at 2am and 5am when she checked her pulse and reflexes			0
it was when she made another visit at 7am that she realised there was a problem			2
she said : ' i raised her arm and it flopped			0
it was then that i knew my diagnosis was wrong			0
i realised it was not just a fit and i needed to call the emergency services			1
' when asked why she had not called an ambulance immediately , she said : ' i just felt that i had experience of epileptic seizures			2
i felt i could cope because it was something i had done in the past			0
' i felt it was something i was capable of looking after , but i was wrong			0
' an inquest heard last year that the patient was taken to @entity92 in the morning , and died there on july 26			1

' mrs @entity0 failed to seek medical help after the woman was found unresponsive in a wheelchair at @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 ( pictured ) , and instead decided to put her to bed to ' sleep it off ' ms @entity50 said she became concerned for the patient 's welfare after she found her apparently asleep in her wheelchair			1
she said : ' i had never seen her fall asleep in her wheelchair before			0
i tried to wake her by calling her name and patting her hands and arms but she did not respond			0

she was a heavy sleeper but i was concerned on this occasion as she was not responding in any way			0
' i told mrs @entity0 that i was going to call paramedics and that she needed to stay in the home to tell them what had happened the night before			1

@entity165 , operations manager at @entity15 which currently houses more than 60 residents aged 65 and over , said : ' it is generally accepted that if a patient does not respond to neurological observation an ambulance should be called immediately			1
' at yesterday 's hearing , case presenter @entity171 said : ' these charges , in my submission , amount to a significant failure to provide basic nursing care			0
' they are serious charges that represent a significant departure from the standard that the public expect from the nursing profession			0
' representing mrs @entity0 , @entity184 said she had displayed ' insight ' and ' remorse '			1
he added : ' she has demonstrated quite clearly to us the remorse that she continues to feel			0
