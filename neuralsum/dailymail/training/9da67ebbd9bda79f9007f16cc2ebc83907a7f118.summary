by @entity1 reporter published : 12:40 est , 9 december 2013 @entity3 : 13:44 est , 9 december 2013 controversy : president @entity5 dissolved @entity7 's main news agency president @entity5 today tightened his control over @entity7 's media by dissolving the main state news agency and replacing it with an organisation that is to promote @entity13 's image abroad			1
with the stroke of a pen , @entity5 abolished @entity16 and created a news agency to be known as @entity18 , or @entity19			1
it is the second in two weeks strengthening @entity5 's hold on the media as he tries to reassert his authority after protests against his rule			1
most @entity7 media outlets are already loyal to @entity5 , and opponents get little air time , but the shake - up underlined their importance to @entity5 keeping power and the @entity33 's concern about the president 's ratings and image			1
conservative news anchor , @entity37 has been appointed as the new organisation 's chief			1
the controversial journalist - described as a ' powerful propagandist ' - provoked outraged after once saying the organs of homosexuals should not be used in transplants			0
' the main focus of ... @entity18 ( @entity19 ) is to highlight abroad the state policy and public life of the @entity7 , ' said a decree signed by @entity5			1
@entity49 , the head of the presidential administration , told reporters that the changes were intended to save money and improve the state media			0
but the new organisation has strong similarities to @entity16 , a @entity57 - era news agency whose role included writing articles about ' the social - economic and cultural life of the @entity57 people and items reflecting @entity57 society 's point of view on important internal and international events '			2
@entity16 said in an @entity70 - language article about @entity5 's step : ' the move is the latest in a series of shifts in @entity7 's news landscape which appear to point towards a tightening of state control in the already heavily regulated media sector			1
' @entity79 : @entity5 's regime has faced growing popular resistance , such as this authorized opposition protest against the alleging mass fraud in parliamentary polls in central @entity85 in 2011 crackdown : @entity7 police detain a protester demonstrating against the 2012 election of @entity5 which was mired in accusations of widespread fraud @entity18 's focus on building up @entity7 abroad could solidify @entity5 's grip on information by further limiting sources of news for @entity7 whose tv screens are dominated by state - controlled channels			1
@entity5 's decree appeared to have little effect on the two other major @entity7 news agencies , state - run @entity99 and private @entity100 , but it could benefit both by making @entity16 's replacement less of a competitor domestically			1
@entity99 is the successor of the @entity57 official @entity99 agency , while @entity100 has more leeway as a private agency but is restricted by the @entity33 's dominance			2
loyal : president @entity5 named @entity37 , pictured , as the head of @entity19 the new head of @entity18 has been described as a ' powerful propagandist ' by a prominent member of parliament , @entity117			2
but said this was a good thing and that he was suitable for the job			0
in his third term , after weathering protests led by urban liberals , the 61 - year - old @entity5 has often appealed to conservatives and championed the @entity125 as a moral guide for society			2
@entity37 has proved a loyal @entity5 supporter as a television presenter , at times making provocative remarks			2
in 2010 he said homosexuals should be banned from donating blood or sperm and last year said they should also be banned from donating organs			0
@entity5 has been @entity7 's dominant leader since he was first elected president in 2000			1
he began his third term in the @entity33 in may 2012 after stepping aside to serve for four years as prime minister because of constitutional limits			0
the opposition staged big street protests against him for several months from december 2011 , following a parliamentary election they said was rigged			0
the demonstrations have faded but @entity5 's popularity ratings have declined from their peak during his first two terms - from 2000 until 2008			2
the @entity33 extended its grip over radio and television broadcasting on nov. 26 when the media arm of state - controlled @entity151 bought mining tycoon @entity153 's @entity152			0
through the deal , the @entity155 gas ministry - now @entity7 's largest firm by revenue - will add tv and radio stations , cinemas and film production and distribution assets to a sprawling portfolio built up around commercial channel @entity165			1
the @entity33 already funds an @entity70 - language tv channel called rt which was initially known as @entity19			0
it is not clear whether the two will operate separately and @entity19 's head , @entity169 , said she had been unaware of the move			0
the new organisation will be created in @entity16 's headquarters in central @entity13			0
the fate of its journalists and other employees was not immediately clear			0
@entity16 was created as the @entity177 in 1941 , after @entity178 invaded the @entity57 , and issues reports in @entity7 and foreign languages .			0

new agency 's *mission* is to project @entity7 's image abroad
@entity5 names controversial conservative news anchor as chief
second shift in @entity7 media *industry* in two weeks
