to most eyes she was just a little girl doing no harm to anyone as she made her way to school with her father			1
but to the local police , @entity6 was a law - breaking menace ... because she was riding her bicycle on the pavement			1
an officer stopped the four - year - old and threatened to confiscate the purple bike , which is fitted with stabilisers , if she did not get off and walk			1
they had paused to feed the ducks when the policeman warned her it was against the law to ride on the pavement			1
former soldier mr @entity24 , 34 , said : ‘ at first i thought he was joking but he looked deadly serious			0
‘ i said , “ you must be kidding			0
what do you want me to do , make her ride on the busy road ? it ’s rush hour			0
” ‘ he just shrugged and said , “ she must get off the bike and walk and i ’m going to sit here and make sure you do n’t put her back on it			0
if you do , i ’ll confiscate the bike			0
’ the officer kept watch as they began the one - mile walk uphill to @entity60			1
when @entity6 arrived at school she was in floods of tears , mr @entity24 said			1
traumatic experience : by the time @entity6 was in school , ' she was so upset a teacher had to calm her down ' ‘ the poor thing thought she was going to be put in jail			1
i ’m absolutely outraged that a policeman can act in this way			0
surely the police have better things to do than pick on parents taking their kids to school ? ’ @entity6 ’s mother @entity75 , 33 , said : ‘ when @entity30 came home and told me what had happened i could n’t believe it			1
‘ how on earth is my daughter riding her little bike with stabilisers to school a criminal offence ? surely there needs to be some common sense applied			2
‘ you ca n’t expect a four - year - old to ride in the road – it ’s not exactly safe			0
‘ i am trying to teach her that they [ the police ] are friendly			2
now that has all gone out the window			0
’ @entity95 have now apologised to the family , admitting that common sense should have prevailed , but @entity6 ’s parents are considering making a formal complaint so no other child is treated in the same way			1
' absolutely outraged ' : mr @entity24 ( left ) said his daughter @entity6 ' thought she was going to be put in jail ' ' unbelievable ' : @entity6 's mother @entity75 ( above ) accepted it was illegal to ride on the pavement , but added that it was ' ridiculous to think a four - year - old is not allowed cycling groups criticised the officer ’s actions			1
@entity111 of @entity112 , the national cycling charity , said : ‘ everyone lets their children ride on the pavement			2
it is perfectly normal and not criminal			0
’ a @entity112 spokesman said : ‘ a four - year - old child should be encouraged to cycle and not be deterred			0
it is good exercise and gives them a sense of independence			0
police officers should use their discretion – this child was n’t causing any danger or distress			2
’ cyclists are told in section 64 of the @entity133 that ' you must not cycle on a pavement ' - which is backed up in law by section 72 of the @entity139			1
the penalty for cycling on the pavement is a fixed penalty notice of £ 30 under section 51 and schedule 3 of the @entity145 1988			2
however , children under 10 can not be charged with committing a crime , although they can be given a local child curfew - an overnight ban from being in public without an adult			0
last year cycling minister @entity152 told police that cyclists should not be fined for mounting the pavement to avoid dangerous stretches of road			1
he urged police to remember official guidelines from 1999 which state that fines are not aimed at those using pavements out of ‘ fear of traffic ’ , provided they show consideration for pedestrians .			2

@entity6 was cycling with stabilisers in @entity21 with her father
but officer ' pulled over and told them her actions were against the law '
@entity6 was left in tears and police have since apologised to her family
