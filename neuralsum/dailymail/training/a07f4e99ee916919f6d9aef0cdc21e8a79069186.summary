pupils at one secondary school in @entity2 will undergo fitness training every day in an effort to tackle childhood obesity			1
students will be taught to squat when picking up a football and lunge when tying up shoelaces so that a positive relationship with exercise is fostered - even in children who do n't like sport			1
@entity13 , in @entity14 , @entity15 , will become the first to introduce a specially - designed anti-obesity programme into its curriculum			1
pupils at one @entity2 secondary school will undergo fitness training every day as part of a new independent programme which aims to tackle childhood obesity from january next year , students will spend a total of three and a half hours per week doing some form of physical exercise - 75 per cent more than the national average			1
the frequency of @entity30 lessons will increase from one per week to daily activities with pupils performing exercises such as squats , press - ups , lunges and burpees			1
pupils who buy school dinners will also be encouraged to plump for a healthier option that contains less fat , salt and additives in an attempt to tackle @entity2 's Â£ 5.1 billion epidemic			2
the news comes after doctors recently called for an emergency taskforce to be set up to tackle childhood obesity			1
they warned that an entire generation will be ' destroyed ' by a diet of junk food and sugary drinks unless urgent action is taken			0
in an open letter to the chief medical officer for @entity57 , professor dame @entity58 , the @entity59 ( @entity59 ) and 11 partner organisations said a national @entity61 ( @entity61 ) should be formed as ' a matter of urgency '			0
it has been devised with a view of helping teachers to incorporate simple but more structured fitness training into and around traditional , curriculum - based @entity30 lessons			1
pupils are taught to squat , for example , and encouraged to do so when picking - up a football			1
this is more beneficial to the leg and back muscles than simply bending - over from the hip			0
they are also taught to twist correctly when playing netball , and to lunge when tying their shoelaces			1
the exercises are said to be particularly effective because they are also used everyday school life - when picking up a pen , for instance			2
this means that youngsters who do not have an active interest in sport or @entity30 still benefit from basic fitness			2
latest figures show many children are already obese by the time they reach secondary school			2
almost a third of 10 to 11 - year - olds and more than a fifth of four to five - year - olds were overweight or obese			0
today 's independent initiative to introduce daily exercise in schools , called the @entity101 and @entity102 ( @entity103 ) , will be incorporated into the @entity13 's curriculum on january 6 , 2015 , and will run for a trial period of six weeks			1
if this is a success then the program will continue until 2018			0
its aim - to fight childhood obesity and support pupils ' wellbeing by giving them a ' positive and purposeful experience ' with exercise - is nothing new			1
but unlike existing schemes , @entity103 is designed to be integrated into the curriculum , rather than run in conjunction with it			0
if the trial at @entity13 is successful , @entity103 looks set to roll out in schools across the @entity2 next year			1
other schools , including @entity120 , an exclusive girl 's school in @entity123 , and @entity124 in @entity14 , @entity125 , have already expressed an interest			1
@entity127 , headteacher at @entity13 , said : ' we are keen to introduce a better standard of physical education into our curriculum while being aware that our students ' health and wellbeing generally should also remain a priority			1
' we have already introduced healthier lunch options to tackle obesity , but it is n't enough by itself			2
' children need to be more active as inactivity results in obesity and other health issues that can continue into adulthood			2
' as a school we feel that we have a duty of care to do all we can to safeguard our pupils against the growing problem of childhood obesity and believe that @entity103 will align perfectly with our aims			1
' according to the @entity152 ( @entity152 ) , childhood obesity is one of the most ' serious public health challenges of the @entity155 '			1
pupils who buy school dinners will be encouraged to go for healthier options with less fat , salt and additives in the @entity2 , almost a third of 10 to 11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4 to 5 year olds are either obese or overweight , according to figures from the @entity167			0
but despite obesity being largely preventable , @entity103 's creator , @entity170 says schools have been ' generally unaware ' of the ' straightforward ' measures that can be put in place to curb it at a grassroots level			2
mr @entity170 , a recently retired navy petty officer , drew on his 13 years as a fitness instructor and clinical exercise specialist to create a program specifically designed for schools			1
it has been devised with a view of helping teachers to incorporate simple but more structured fitness training into and around traditional , curriculum - based @entity30 lessons			1
the news comes after doctors recently called for an emergency taskforce to be set up to tackle childhood obesity			1

in an open letter to the chief medical officer for @entity57 sent in september , professor dame @entity58 , the @entity59 ( @entity59 ) and 11 partner organisations said a national @entity61 ( @entity197 ) should be formed as ' a matter of urgency '			0
latest figures show many children are already obese by the time they reach secondary school			0
18.9 per cent of children in year 6 aged 10 to 11 were obese and a further 14.4 per cent were overweight			0
of the children in reception aged four to five , latest figures suggest 9.3 per cent were obese and another 13.0 per cent were overweight			0
in total almost a third of 10 to 11 - year - olds and more than a fifth of four to five - year - olds were overweight or obese			0

this means that youngsters who do not have an active interest in sport or @entity30 still benefit from basic fitness			2
@entity103 - described as a world first - is sold on licence , and affiliate schools receive training workshops for teachers and teaching assistants , instructional handbooks , illustrated text books for students , and video support			1
schools are then free to integrate @entity103 's recommendations as they see fit			0
@entity14 's @entity13 , which specialises in behavioural difficulties , is the first school to sign up to carry out @entity103			1
according to @entity250 figures , 19 per cent of children in @entity15 and @entity248 are obese or ' dangerously overweight '			0
headteacher @entity127 added : ' @entity103 offers a stimulating and fun way to increase the frequency - and , by a small margin , the length - of physical education classes and engage with young people regardless of whether they are into sports or not			0
' we look forward to trialling the programme in january 2015 and based on the pupil feedback and results , incorporating it into our curriculum on a long - term basis			2
' mr @entity170 , @entity103 's creator , completed three tours of duty in the @entity267 , @entity268 and @entity269 before retiring from the @entity270 last month			0
he said : ' it is a widely reported fact that there is concern about the state of @entity30 in schools , however there has not been a credible and cost - effective alternative to existing curriculum guidelines			0
' @entity103 is n't about transforming schools into boot camps , but rather a method of introducing simple and straightforward exercises into school 's current @entity30 lessons			2
' latest figures show many children are already obese by the time they reach secondary school			0
in total , almost a third of 10 to 11 - year - olds and more than a fifth of four to five - year - olds were overweight or obese			0

pupils at @entity13 in @entity14 will undergo fitness training every day
it is hoped this will cut childhood obesity and help children enjoy sport
students will be taught moves they can use in their *normal* day
these include squatting when picking up a football and a lunge to tie laces
designed this way so that pupils who ' do n't like sport ' can use the move
from january , students will spent *3.5* hours a week doing exercise
may be rolled out to other schools across the country if feedback is good
