by @entity0 school milk must be offered to all pupils from the @entity4 , it emerged last night			1
officials believe it forms a key part of a healthy diet			2

however , it will not be free for all			0
reinstating the place of milk in daily school life is a remarkable turnaround for the conservatives			1
it has been an emotive issue for the party since the then education secretary @entity39 was nicknamed the ‘ milk snatcher ’ in 1971 for scrapping the free drink for the over-sevens			1
four years ago @entity43 had to stop his higher education minister ’s plans to axe it for under - fives to cut costs			1
the food standards to be unveiled by education secretary @entity50 today aim to clamp down on sugary and fried products			1
the milk will also help address concerns about low calcium levels in children			1
currently , schools are only encouraged to offer ‘ healthy drinks ’ to pupils and many do not offer milk at all			1
milk must be offered to all schoolchildren under the new food standards obesity campaigners welcomed the measure but said they would have gone further in trying to cut juice consumption			1
the under - fives will continue to get their milk for nothing but older pupils will be charged , except for those on free school meals – but it is hoped making small cartons available will encourage more pupils to make a habit of drinking it			1
a @entity80 source said : ‘ this is new			0
we hope making low fat milk regularly available at least once a day will help encourage children to have healthier diets ’			1
the return of milk follows a review of school dinners by restaurateurs @entity90 and @entity92			1

they concede meals have improved dramatically over the years since the celebrity chef ’s crusade against fast food horrors such as @entity103 – which were later banned			0
but officials say the guidelines brought in by @entity106 – which forced schools to submit meal plans and samples to a laboratory to check their nutritional content were too complex and bureaucratic			0
under the guidelines , fruit juice will be restricted to one 150ml glass per day from january amid growing evidence of the damaging effect of its rich natural sugars on children ’s developing teeth			2
many nutritionists now recommend that children are only allowed one small glass of fruit juice per week as a treat			0
the new guidelines will specify portions from particular food groups as opposed to dictating precise menus			0
children must be offered three different types of fruit a week and only two portions of food cooked in oil such as chips , battered fish or chicken nuggets			2
@entity139 carbohydrates such as brown rice are approved , while refined foods such as white bread are out			0
the new rules are intended to make meals more ‘ creative ’ than under the current system which calls for them to contain specific levels of nutrients such as zinc , vitamin a and folic acid			1
the food standards to be unveiled by education secretary @entity50 aim to clamp down on sugary and fried products offered to children newly created academies and free schools will also have to follow the food guidelines			1
until now , academies – free from council control and set up post- 2010 – had been free to make their own rules			2
this caused controversy last year when research showed nine out of ten academies were selling pupils chocolates and crisps which are banned in other state schools			0
existing academies will be encouraged to follow the new guidelines			0
the @entity80 said the new standards would be easier to enforce and allow schools to be more ‘ creative ’ in what they serve and make food preparation a ‘ joyful ’ experience			0
@entity90 said : ‘ this is about encouraging healthier habits and we are trying to encourage milk and water as drinks of choice			2
fruit juice is as sugary in many cases as canned soft drinks			2
’ mr @entity50 will say today : ‘ these new food standards will ensure all children are able to eat healthy , nutritious meals at school			1
‘ we now have a clear and concise set of food standards which are easier for cooks to follow and less expensive to enforce			0
crucially we have achieved this without any compromise on quality or nutrition			0
’ @entity199 of the @entity200 welcomed the crackdown on sugary juices , but said he would have gone further in restricting it to one small glass per week			2
mr @entity199 said : ‘ fruit juice is known to be really laden with sugar , and it needs to be a treat not an everyday occurrence			0
the preference in schools should be water which is hugely beneficial			0
