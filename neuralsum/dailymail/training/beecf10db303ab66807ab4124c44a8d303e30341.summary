@entity0 have been a revelation this season but there is one player who has been at the heart of it all			1
@entity7 is now the club ’s main man and he has the rest of the team dancing to his tune			1
signing song on loan was one of the most astute transfers of the summer			2
plenty of @entity18 fans will be looking at him and asking : ‘ why is n’t he doing that job in our midfield ? ’ they have a point			1
@entity26 saw a good opportunity and grabbed it			2
@entity0 midfielder @entity7 is now stronger and more disciplined after my final season at @entity18 i was invited back by the club to act as a mentor and was there when @entity7 arrived			1
he was only 17 but he went straight into training with the first - team group			2
along with @entity35 , he was earmarked as a potential successor to @entity37			2
@entity7 ’s talent was obvious but he still needed a lot of work and @entity41 is one of the best at developing young players			1
the focus with @entity7 was always passing			1
@entity41 likes midfielders to open up their body and receive the ball on the half - turn , giving them the chance to glance over their shoulder before receiving the ball to feet			2
@entity7 ’s talent was obvious but he still needed a lot of work at @entity18 along with @entity35 , @entity7 was earmarked as a potential successor to @entity37 ( right ) i watched @entity7 work to improve for hours with @entity60 , @entity41 ’s right - hand man and a real technician			1
he ’d do extra drills between two backboards , passing the ball to himself and learning to open up his body			2
if you can keep a good body shape in midfield you can open up the whole game			0
now @entity0 are reaping the benefits			1
he can receive the ball with one foot and pass with the other , which helps him see the bigger picture very early			0
he rarely takes more than two touches and that gets @entity0 moving quickly			2
he is an excellent passer , too , a real side - foot specialist , so it ’s no surprise @entity0 average around 50 passes more per game this season compared to last			1
he is stronger and more disciplined and it ’s interesting to see the @entity0 staff on the touchline asking him to sit deeper			1
at @entity18 he was like a wind - up toy			1
he charged around and quickly ran out of energy			0
now he is more effective at managing that energy and realises the importance of staying back			0
song was easily distracted when he first arrived at @entity18 in 2005 when he first arrived in @entity90 i wondered if he was more interested in the trappings of @entity93 football			1
he was easily distracted by the things that were on offer — as soon as he realised he could get free boots he would have them delivered from all over and his locker was stuffed with freebies			1
it was partly immaturity but also suggested he was n’t always focused			0
when @entity100 came calling he was quick to give in to temptation			0
the allure of @entity100 was like @entity104 ’s cave — prestige , titles , financial rewards			0
that ’s hard to turn down , but with the players @entity100 have it was always going to be difficult			0
@entity111 tried and failed so the warning signs were there — the grass is not always greener			0
when @entity111 and @entity115 left , @entity41 let them go to further their careers			0
with @entity7 , it was more of a disappointment			2
@entity18 invested a lot of time in him and hoped he would want to stay and repay them			2
song was unable to resist joining @entity123 giants @entity100 in 2012 but he is loving life at @entity0			1
my sources tell me he ’s been a breath of fresh air at the training ground			0
he arrives flamboyantly dressed and trains with a big grin on his face			0
the fans love what he brings to the team and he is more appreciated at @entity135 than he was at the @entity136 or the @entity137			1
he has matured , too			0
where he used to try to catch the eye with his dyed hair , now he ’s doing so with performances on the pitch			0
if @entity0 can afford him , @entity7 faces a dilemma			1
will another glittery move prise him away or will he stay put ? he ’s loved at @entity135 and could do far worse than to stay on song at @entity0			1
@entity7 returned to @entity146 on loan and he has been a breath of fresh of air at @entity0 @entity151 what a great story for @entity153 to be drawn against @entity154 in the @entity155			1
i played against the @entity157 many times , though often it was like playing a bunch of louts ! they would turn up at your ground with the ghetto blaster music blaring			0
they tried to make as much noise as they could to disrupt opponents			0
it was like their battle cry to get into match mode but it never affected me			0
in away games in their tunnel , you would line up and look across to see @entity177 head - butting the toilet door and @entity179 going through his martial arts routine			2
if anything , that wound you up even more and you just thought , ‘ right			0
let ’s get it on ! ’ every thursday i ’ll be answering your questions live on @entity185			0
