by @entity0 published : 20:00 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 06:09 est , 14 may 2013 they were the bread and butter cars of @entity3 family motoring during the 1970s and ‘ 80s and still remembered nostalgically by millions – yet today they are an endangered species			1
but a generation of popular cars that once dominated the nation ’s highways and kerbsides – with evocative names like @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 - are now on the brink of extinction			2
others like the @entity24 - successor to the @entity25 and named by its workforce - were driven by one			0
the @entity29 is fading into obscurity , with just 906 in existence today , the report found despite its sleek - looking front , the @entity32 has just 310 lucky owners now @entity35 1.3 @entity36			2
introduced in 1980 , the @entity35 was available with the 1275cc @entity38 engine or the 1700cc o - series engine yet , for example , only 174 @entity40 are left of the 175,247 that were built			0
and some models fare even worse			0
for unlike their sportier siblings of the same era all but a few die - hard fans are maintaining them fit for the road			0
the fascinating details of a dying breed that will rekindle memories for millions of mums and dads who remember them from their own childhoods are revealed today in a new analysis by car industry expert @entity55 and his website @entity57 the analysis of cars built before 1995 reveals that when measured and ranked as as a proportion of the total of each model built , 1980s cars have disappeared from roads faster than any others			1
but while some may mourn that so few are left , others with less rose - tinted spectacles and memories of the era of poor car quality and motor industry strikes epitomised by union militants like @entity74 , may wonder instead that any of them have survived at all			0
the @entity76 's classic design was a eye - catching in its day , and it now turns heads because it 's such a rare sight sight for sore eyes : the @entity80 is one of the most endangered cars on @entity3 roads today dying breed : @entity24 was the successor to the @entity25 and named by its workforce the @entity13 is highest on the list of endangered cars with just 0.0453 per cent of those even built still being driven today			1
famed for its square or ‘ quartic ’ steering wheel , of the 642,340 @entity93 built between 1973 and 1982 , just 291 remain today			2
though by its fans and owners ’ group , the report says it marks the point at which ‘ @entity99 lost the will to live			0
’ the @entity13 is followed by such evocative names as the @entity14 ( just 296 remain ) , the wedge - shaped @entity102 ( 121 ) , @entity103 ( 369 ) , and the classic @entity104 ( 1,057 ) , @entity16 ( 674 ) , @entity17 ( 401 ) , @entity35 ( 174 ) , the ground - breaking and futuristic looking @entity32 ( 310 ) , and the @entity107 series including the @entity108 and @entity109			2
fewer than 1,000 ( 995 ) are still around			0
next in the endangered list comes the popular @entity24 which enjoyed celebrity status as princess @entity113 's car when she married @entity114 in july 1981 - just 1,930 of the 1.5 million built between 1980 and 1981 survive today			1
a classic : of the 642,340 @entity93 built between 1973 and 1982 , just 291 remain today the wedge - shaped @entity102 has just 121 left in existence after owners switched to more modern models the report warned that 1980s cars are particularly vulnerable because their passage into popular classic status is yet to happen and their disappearance has been hastened by needless scrappage there are a mere 401 @entity17 's left on @entity3 's roads today - and signal the end of the era of 1980s cars then there ’s the legendary @entity132 which most recently had its moment of fame as a star of retro @entity139 - style police drama ‘ @entity138 ’ set in the 1970s and which has fared slightly better with 5,411 still around – but still only 1.13 per cent of the 4.15million built tin the 20 years to 1982			1
next is the @entity142 and 1300 ( 206 survive ) , the @entity15 ( 1,012 ) , the polular @entity143 ( 768 ) , @entity76 ( just 84 ) , the cute @entity29 with an engine that used to blow ( 906 ) , rover 200 ( 1,371 ) , and the @entity146 ( 488 )			0
propping up 20th place is the infamous ‘ jelly - mould ’ @entity149 of 1982 - 93 of which some 15,282 remain out of a total run of 3.47million or 0.44 per cent			0
the @entity152 report notes : ‘ the 1980s may have enjoyed a fashion and pop revival but cars from that decade are some of the most endangered cars on @entity3 roads today			1
many of @entity3 's once - popular family cars are on the verge of disappearing completely			1
’ it notes : ‘ the @entity24 is typical			0
it was once a common sight on @entity3 roads and enjoyed celebrity status as princess @entity113 's car when she married @entity114 in july 1981			1
the @entity16 is under - appreciated , with only 674 left in the care of owner today			2
many of @entity3 's once - popular family cars are on the verge of disappearing completely a 1983 @entity143 may have been popular at the time , but the amount on the roads has dwindled to 768 nippy run around : the @entity169 has fared a little better , with 1,012 in existence the legendary @entity132 most recently had its moment of fame as a star of retro @entity139 - style police drama ' life on @entity179 ' set ‘ it was also the driving school car of choice for @entity182 , and everyone knew someone who had one – and now , there 's a mere 823 @entity187 , from an original production run of 1.5 million between 1981 - 1991			1
’ the report adds : ‘ the once - derided @entity13 has suffered the largest decline of all , with just 291 remaining in the @entity3 at the end of 2011 , from a total production run of 640,000 between 1973 and 1982			1
‘ the @entity132 is another model on the list that may raise a few eyebrows			0
after all it was @entity3 's best - selling car between 1973 and 1980			1
‘ @entity199 , it was the darling of a million sales reps – but it most recently had its moment of fame as the star of the tv drama @entity138			0
just 5,411 remain registered in the @entity3 , from more than four million built			2
’ but while all top 20 cars on the ‘ @entity205 ’ have a survival rate of less than 1 per cent , some classic cars at the other end of the scale had impressive survival rates			2
the @entity211 emerges as the @entity3 ’s most popular classic car with 38 per cent of its pre- 1995 models ( 3,361 ) still surviving today			1
it is followed by the @entity215 with a quarter ( 25 % ) of those built between 1970 and 1977 ( 6,466 ) still around			0
the sporty @entity217 is in third place with more than one in 5 ( 21.2 per cent ) of ther total satill around ( 3,240 ) @entity221 , editor of @entity222 said : ' this list of endangered cars is fascinating – pretty much all of them littered the @entity3 roads as recently as 10 years ago and now you ’ll be lucky to spot them at a classic car meeting			1
‘ the low survival rate for these models is shocking			0
1980s cars are particularly vulnerable – because their passage into popular classic status is yet to happen and their disappearance has been hastened by needless scrappage and artificially low market values in recent years			1
' mr @entity221 added : ‘ if you 're a fan of unloved 1990s family cars , the read ' em and weep - for they are going fast			0
if you want one , be quick before they 're all gone ! ’ the ‘ @entity245 ’ research by @entity244 was created by examining @entity247 records of classic cars registered between 1950 and 1995 to find out how many were still registered today – both legally on the road or having been registered as being off the road compared to the amount originally built			1
the results are published at the newly launched website @entity57			0

1980s cars are some of the most endangered cars on @entity3 roads today
yet to *achieve* classic status and disappearance hastened by scrappage
