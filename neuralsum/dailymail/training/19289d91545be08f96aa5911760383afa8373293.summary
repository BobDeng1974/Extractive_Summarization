by @entity0 most fisherman would consider themselves lucky to catch one elusive opah fish in their lives , but one recreational fishing boat landed three in one day this on recreational fishing boat landed three in one day last week while searching for @entity8 tuna off the coast of southern @entity10			1
@entity12 - based @entity11 , which takes groups out on multi-day fishing trips , posted at picture on @entity16 of their surprise haul on friday and the photo has now been shared more than 2,000 times			2
anglers @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity24 grin as they pose with their three orange disc - shaped fish , each weighing between 124 and 180 pounds			1
@entity33 , also known as @entity33 , are a rare catch and three at once is even more of a surprise since they do n't often travel in packs @entity33 , also known as @entity33 , are a rare catch for recreational fisherman since they do n't travel in schools and therefore are n't commercially fished either			1
instead , most are caught accidentally by fisherman looking for other fish , such as tuna			1
that 's what the group was looking for last week when they came across the three opah in one day			2
@entity33 also are n't known to stray often into southern @entity10 waters , preferring warmer waters in tropical and sub-tropical seas			1
however , opah catches have been on the rise in the last few years according to a 2012 article by @entity56			1
' it ’s the fish of a lifetime , ' @entity57 said			2
' it ’s like winning the lottery			0
nobody is expecting one of these			0
they are just doing something different to try to get a bite and they hook an opah			0
' @entity69 and @entity70 researcher @entity57 said more opah are getting caught by federal marine research trawls in the area			0
at the time of the article , @entity57 had tags on four opah in the region , to observe their swimming and diving patterns			0
one of those ventured all the way back to more common waters in @entity84 .			0

recreational fisherman rarely catch opah , since the moon - shaped fish does n't travel in a school
they also tend to swim in more warmer tropical and sub-tropical waters
however , opah *sightings* have been on the rise in southern @entity10 over the past few years
