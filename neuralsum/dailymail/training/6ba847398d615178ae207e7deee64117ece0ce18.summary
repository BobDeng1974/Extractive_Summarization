former @entity11 boss and @entity12 international @entity3 takes the reins with the club in 21st place in the league after five games			1
the move also makes @entity3 the only black manager in the @entity20			1
done deal : former @entity11 boss @entity3 has been appointed the new @entity5 manager @entity3 said on his return to management : ' i 'm honoured to be the man chosen to lead @entity5 forward			1
' it was right to bring it to this point - an international break where players can recharge and the chosen applicant would have enough time with the team leading up to the next championship game			0
' there 's a good squad here already with lots of experience , potential and some good young players			0
' the loan window opens soon so hopefully there will be a chance to move a few players - some hopefully coming in and maybe some who need to go and play some football and get some experience			0
' i 'm sure we 'll have a really competitive squad , then come january if we 're able to enquire about players and bring players in permanently then we 'll do that			0

we believe we have in @entity3			2
‘ as i said when the process began , i felt it was important that we found a manager who had ‘ done it ’ and @entity3 certainly fits that bill			1
he has ‘ done it ’ by guiding @entity11 to promotion to the @entity6 and then finishing ninth in the 2012/13 championship season – all achieved on a limited budget by getting the best out of his players			0
tough task : @entity3 takes the reins with the club in 21st place in league after five games ‘ @entity3 also has an excellent pedigree of developing young players , with the likes of @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 emerging in @entity11 ’s @entity88 under his guidance			2
that is an important factor in our vision for the @entity92			0
‘ as a player , a coach and a manager , @entity3 knows what it takes to succeed at @entity98			1
alongside his experience with @entity11 , he was also promoted out of this division three times during his playing career and has become accustomed to winning			0

gone : @entity7 left the @entity54 after an opening day defeat against @entity110 ' he is personally highly motivated and we feel he will get the best from the players			2
his record demands respect and we think he is the ideal man to take this @entity92 forward			0
