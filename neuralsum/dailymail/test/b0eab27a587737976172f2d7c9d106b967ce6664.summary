@entity0 is undoubtedly the queen of self - promotion , posting ' selfie ' snaps to her millions of followers on a daily basis and even releasing a book filled with her self - taken pictures			1
and now , @entity0 's secret weapon to achieving the perfect photo has seemingly been revealed			1
@entity9 is convinced that the social media superstar has been using @entity11 to edit her selfies - a £ 2.99 photo editing app designed to help you edit your portrait photographs into ' perfection '			1
the £ 2.99 photo editing app is designed to help you edit your portrait photographs into ' perfection ' - but the results were rather scary ... and obvious not only can you remove spots , improve skin texture and enhance eyes , but you can also fix grey hair , reshape your face and even fill in bald patches			1
you can also whiten teeth , remove wrinkles and elongate or shorten a face entirely before instantly sharing the retouched photos to @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 or @entity42 , or via email			1
most of the tools are easy to use and you simply have to zoom and pan , then use your finger to paint on the effect			0
@entity50 's @entity49 , @entity51 and @entity20 tested it out to trim down their figures - with quite startling results			2
@entity51 , left , before , and , right , after , tested out the tools , which are easy to use - you simply have to zoom and pan and use your fingers to alter your waistline the founders of the app - which @entity50 tested : before , left , and , after , right - say they have a strong background in the academia , which they used to take the most exciting , state of the art technologies and integrated them into a product in the most user - friendly way the ' reshape ' and ' resize ' tools let you modify your figure by lengthening your legs , sucking in your waist or trimming down your arms			1
it is , however , slightly obvious what you 're up to			0
one look at the background of the image and you can see the wall has a curve and is slightly distorted			0
countless celebrities - including @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity0 - have been called out on mishaps like this by savvy social media users			2
not only can you remove spots , improve skin texture and enhance eyes with the app , but you can also fix grey hair and reshape your face			2
@entity20 , left , before , and , right , after using it the app , which @entity19 , left , before , and , right , after , tried out , claims to give any user the ability to achieve high - end , realistic looking results , comparable only to what a professional can achieve on the desktop with @entity99 the app 's founders do , however , think they 're onto something with their latest offering			2
' @entity11 is different , ' said @entity103 , @entity104 ceo			0
' unlike other apps , it gives any user the ability to achieve high - end , realistic looking results , comparable only to what a professional can achieve on the desktop with @entity99			0
' he then explained how this was achieved : ' we have a strong background in the academia , which we used to take the most exciting , state of the art technologies , that were never seen on mobile devices , and integrated them into a product in the most user - friendly way			0
' with the tiniest bit of effort , everyone can get great looking photos of themselves			0
' and it seems that our image conscious society are rushing to improve their cyber image because when it was released , it was the third most popular app on @entity131 just behind what 's @entity133 and the catchphrase game			0
photoshop master @entity135 told @entity136 that shots of @entity0 and her pal @entity138 on @entity39 may have been ' manipulated ' to enhance the @entity141 star 's shapely figure drawing the background of one of @entity0 's pics as an example , @entity142 explained the slight curvature of the door frame could be proof that @entity151 's wife has been digitally doctoring her snaps @entity0 often showcases her trim figure on her @entity39 page via a series of selfies but some experts say her waist appears smaller in her selfie ( left ) compared with pictures later taken by the paparazzi ( right ) while some of her @entity0 's @entity39 snaps , left , have no apparent signs of distortion , she does appear slightly different - perhaps due to a filter - to paparazzi shots from the same event , right			1
