by @entity0 published : 10:30 est , 26 march 2012 updated : 13:32 est , 26 march 2012 along the wide - open expanses and rolling prairie of western @entity5 surrounding the state 's booming oil patch , all sorts of bizarre litter can be found clogging the once picturesque roadside : derelict hardhats , single boots , buckets , pallets , pieces of machinery , shredded semi tires , oily clothing , cigarette butts			1
the worst ? plastic jugs of urine pitched out windows as scores of truckers pass through oil country			1
litter has become an escalating problem as the rush to tap vast caches of crude escalates in @entity5			1
growing problem : @entity5 has increasing numbers of trucks passing through thanks to an oil boom , but with that comes more trash			1
the most worrying is the bottles of discarded urine drivers throw out , as seen here as the number of trucks coming to the oil mecca increases , so does the trash			1
some of the industrial rubbish blows in from unsecured truckloads , but for many , the most frustrating trash is the gallons of discarded urine			1
the problem has local leaders and rural residents scratching their heads			0
there 's no money to build new rest stops , and once - eager community volunteers are less willing to pick up junk now because they do n't want to handle human waste			1
so little has been done to address the problem , save for upgrading mowing tractors with cabs to protect operators from getting sprayed with urine when the jugs are hit by a wheel or blade			1
' i do n't know if it can be solved other than by people having some respect because right now the countryside is being taken for granted , ' said @entity71 mayor @entity70			0
' it 's a growing problem and it 's sad			0
' the jugs are known around these parts as ' trucker bombs , ' and they freckle the countryside			2
they show up in a variety of containers : antifreeze jugs , beverage bottles or milk cartons , and are usually hurled by drivers too hurried or weak - bladdered to stop and relieve themselves politely			2
there are only three rest stops along one long patch of road , and drivers are relieving themselves in a variety of containers : antifreeze jugs , beverage bottles or milk cartons , and then hurling the ' trucker bombs ' out their windows of course , there 's a reason they 're thrown in the first place			1
there are only three rest stops along the hundreds of miles of highway in western @entity5 , and all are well outside the busiest areas of the state 's oil patch			1
until there are more truck stops or rest areas on the much - traveled route , the jugs will probably still be tossed by truckers , said @entity112 , executive vice president of the @entity113			1
' it is a huge issue , but one of the biggest problems is there is n't lot of places for these guys stop to properly dispose of the receptacles , ' @entity112 said			0
' i do n't know that it 's a case of being disrespectful but of the unbelievable growth out there			0
' the oil rush has brought the promise of prosperity to the state but it also has radically altered its landscape and culture			2
nodding donkey pumps now rise from the once barren prairie , and there 's been an influx of thousands of outsiders seeking their fortune in the oil patch			2
@entity5 has leapfrogged past a half - dozen states since 2006 to become the nation 's no. 3 oil producer , and state officials estimate @entity5 will surpass @entity143 and will trail only @entity144 within a year			1
that 's the reason truck traffic has surged			0
the number of trucking companies operating in @entity5 increased by 600 last year to about 6,000 , with most working in the oil patch , @entity112 said			1
nearly 100 new trucking companies were established in january alone , he said			2
catching urine - tossing truckers is difficult , according to authorities			2
troopers issued an average of a dozen littering tickets annually in western @entity5 over the past three years , up from about seven in the three years before that			1
trucking has boomed to keep up with the oil growth and 100 new trucking companies were formed in january alone			1
but the increasing numbers of urine jugs are being partially to blame for the decrease in @entity164 participants ' we have to be in the right place at the right time , ' @entity166 lt. @entity165 said			1
' when a squad car is behind a driver , they are not as inclined to chuck something out the window			0
' even if they do catch someone in the act , the penalties are n't high			0
the @entity178 unsuccessfully pushed legislation more than a decade ago that would have bumped fines from $ 20 to $ 500 on anyone caught dumping human waste on the roadside			0
the agency intended to post roadside signs saying it was illegal to throw human waste on the road or ditch , and advertise the $ 500 fine			0
but lawmakers decided the signs would be off - putting and killed the legislation			0
@entity71 citizens , fed up by littered roadways leading to their town , cleaned up part of the highway south of the city last spring			0
in less than one mile , volunteers picked up more than two heaping truckloads of rubbish			0
but such efforts are tough to sustain			0
membership in the state 's @entity164 program has dropped in the area , and the jugs of urine may be partly to blame , said @entity210 , a @entity178 district engineer in @entity211			1
even though state officials recommend that volunteers stay clear of the jugs and leave them to state maintenance crews to clean up , volunteering is a tough sell			2
for one , the jugs are repulsive			2
two , they can explode under pressure from heat			1
' the membership is down and they 're older , ' @entity210 said			0
' they do n't want to pick up that much stuff and there is too much dangerous stuff like needles and urine jugs			1
' @entity210 said his agency and local officials formed a group last month to address the litter issue in and around the city			0
part of the plan calls for companies working in the oil patch to pay student groups to pick up the trash			2
so far , no one has signed on			0
but at least two companies have volunteered to pick up garbage along stretches of highways in @entity246 and @entity247 , said @entity248 , president of the @entity249			2
@entity250 , treasurer of the local @entity251 in @entity252 , said his group has been picking up trash along roadsides for more than 20 years			2
he said the club has about 15 active trash pickers and all are retirement age			0
@entity250 said he has picked up his share of urine jugs over the years and the amount has increased			1
volunteers wear gloves and carefully handle the urine containers			0
@entity250 says he 's fortunate never to have been showered with an exploding jug of urine			0
' the ditches are full of them , ' he said			0

trucking has boomed in recent years thanks to oil production
only three rest stops over hundreds of miles of western @entity5 highways
urine jugs can explode in the heat
