@entity1 's cheese lovers are paying well over the odds for their favourite food after supermarkets failed to pass on cuts to wholesale prices			2
a report yesterday showed that the retail price of many popular cheeses has actually increased despite a slump in the wholesale dairy market			2
in the case of cheddar the average retail price of a kilo of cheese has risen 1.8 per cent over the past 12 months to £ 8.99			1
but if prices had moved in line with wholesale costs - down 18.6 per cent year on year - a kilo would cost only £ 7.19 , £ 1.80 less than the current price			1
a real luxury : the average price of a kilo of cheddar cheese has risen 1.8 per cent over the past 12 months to £ 8.99			2
but if prices had followed the 18.6 per cent fall in wholesale costs a kilo would cost only £ 7.19 trade magazine @entity29 says that retail price hikes have been even steeper in own - label cheddar , up 3 per cent to £ 7.45 , while promotional activity has kept a lid on the price of the major brands			1
across three of @entity1 's largest cheddar brands - @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 - the average price has risen 0.3 per cent year on year to £ 10.81			0
data from commodities analyst @entity43 showed turmoil in the global dairy markets - made worse by the @entity48 import ban - has contributed to wholesale price drops such as @entity50 skimmed milk powder falling 39 per cent year on year in the 12 months to the end of september			0
at the same time , dairy farmer protests are targeting processors and retailers over a spate of cuts to the price they are paid for their milk			0
yet @entity29 says that a snapshot of the retail price of lines sold in the big four supermarkets on 4 november 2014 , compared with the same products 12 months ago , shows many have actually increased			2
' industry insiders say this suggests retailers have been guarding their margins on @entity71 despite the price war raging in the aisles - though they expect retail prices to come down should wholesale prices continue to fall , ' @entity29 said			1
dairy farmer @entity76 , chairman of the @entity78 dairy board , told @entity79 : ' retailers make an awful lot of money on cheese and it seems they are trying to increase their margins further			0
' @entity86 hit : fans of blue cheese are paying on average 6.1 per cent more than a year ago , at £ 11.87 a kilo			1
even steeper retail price increases have been seen on territorial cheese - again driven by increases in own - label lines			1
across the category , prices have risen 4.5 per cent to £ 8.54 a kilo with branded products up 4.1 per cent to £ 8.62			0
fans of blue cheese have been hardest hit and are paying on average 6.1 per cent more than a year ago , at £ 11.87 a kilo			1
the report says there is better news for bargain - hunting shoppers in the @entity105 cheese category - if they stick to own - label lines			0
on average , own - label @entity105 cheese has fallen 1.6 per cent to £ 10.93 while branded lines have risen 2.7 per cent to £ 9.78			0
processed cheese , meanwhile , has risen 3.2 per cent .			0

@entity71 up 1.8 per cent in past year despite steep falls in wholesale costs
industry insiders say it 's a sign supermarkets are ' guarding their margins '
even steeper retail price increases have been seen on territorial cheese
but fans of blue cheese are hardest hit with a 6.1 per cent price increase
