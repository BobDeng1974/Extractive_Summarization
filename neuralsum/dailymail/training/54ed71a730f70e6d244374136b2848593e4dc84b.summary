by @entity0 a father desperate to prevent his children suffering has launched a clinical trial into a treatment he believes could stop their rare disease progressing			1
@entity7 , 40 , believes he has found a drug that could stop his sons , @entity10 , 10 , and @entity11 , 13 , developing any symptoms			1
both have @entity14 – also known as @entity15 ( @entity16 ) – which causes their urine and bones to turn black			1
if the drug trial is successful , the pill could be offered to all patients with the same genetic condition			1
@entity11 ( left ) and @entity10 ( right ) @entity7 both have a genetic condition called @entity24 which causes their bones and urine to turn black			1
it also causes early - onset osteoarthritis and , possibly , heart disease the boys ' father , @entity31 ( pictured with @entity10 ) , gave up his job in 2010 to help find a cure for the condition			1
he believes a treatment has now been identified and is about to launch a clinical trial dr @entity7 told @entity38 : ‘ we are really pleased			1
‘ we are really excited that the trial is about to start because there has been so much work to get to this point			2
we are also apprehensive even though we are pretty confident the results will be good			0
’ without treatment , as they get older they will develop severe early - onset osteoarthritis and are at risk of brittle bones and heart disease			1
the genetic disease also causes the bones , cartilage , urine and earwax to turn black			1
dr @entity7 , from @entity58 , was so desperate to help his children that he gave up his job as ceo of a charity called @entity63 in 2010 to work for the @entity64			1
currently @entity11 ( right ) and @entity10 ( left ) are healthy but they will start to develop symptoms in early adulthood unless a treatment is found he has now helped organise the clinical trial which he believes could offer a life - saving solution for his children , and for other @entity16 sufferers			1
the trial , which will start on april 14 , will see 42 patients attend a centre in @entity75 where half will be given the drug @entity77			1
the drug is already licenced to treat patients with another rare disease and could become widely available to @entity16 patients if the trial is successful in showing it can stop the disease progressing			1
in total , 70 patients will be given the drug during the four year trial which will be run from centres in @entity75 , @entity88 and @entity89			2
@entity14 causes bone and cartilage to become discoloured			2
image shows the elbow joint of an anonymous sufferer the medical side of the trial is being funded by the @entity97 but the organisers had to raise $ 98,000 to pay for patient transport , carers for the more disabled patients and to provide support for patients			0
they achieved this in the autumn meaning the trial can now start			2
if the trial is successful , the treatment could be made available on the @entity107 within the next five years			1
the trial organisers hope it could stop the disease progressing in older patients who already have symptoms and that it could prevent symptoms developing in younger patients			2
they say patients would just need to take a tablet each day for the rest of their lives			0
dr @entity7 said : ‘ personally , this means hope for my kids and for all of the patients			2
‘ we hear the most horrible stories of people having to stop work and becoming depressed because of the symptoms			0
‘ for me , it is important my kids do n’t suffer this pain			0
’ the boys are currently healthy but without treatment will eventually start to develop symptoms such as joint problems and back pain – the early symptoms of osteoarthritis			1
these symptoms could develop at any time from their mid-teens to their 40s			2
the osteoarthritis suffered by @entity14 patients is caused by a toxic acid called homogentisic acid ( @entity145 ) attacking their bones and cartilage , turning them black and brittle			1
in people with @entity16 , the acid accumulates at 2,000 times the normal rate			0
@entity11 was diagnosed as a baby when his parents noticed his nappies were black - until then they did not realise they carried the gene mutation			0
there was a 25 per cent chance @entity10 would also be affected this also causes discolouration of the ears and black spots in the eyes			2
there is also a growing link between aku and heart disease			1
this is because toxic acid called homogentisic acid @entity145 causes the blood vessels and valves in the heart to harden , turning them black , brittle and less effective at managing the flow of blood around the body			1
although this is still believed to be an uncommon symptom of @entity16 , it is a potentially fatal consequence of the disease			0
@entity16 can also cause several other symptoms , such as kidney , prostate and bladder stones , black or dark sweat or a blue speckled discolouration of the skin			2
however , the clinical trial gives hope that all sufferers of @entity14 will soon be able to live a normal life without developing any symptoms			1
dr @entity7 ( pictured with @entity11 ) believes the drug @entity77 could prevent acid building up in patients and , therefore , prevent symptoms developing			1
the drug is already used to treat another rare disease dr @entity7 believes @entity77 could prevent @entity145 building up in patients and , therefore , prevent symptoms developing			1
he told @entity38 : ‘ my hope is that my children never have to feel the pain of the symptoms – that they just wo n’t have to worry about it			0
’ just after @entity11 was born , dr @entity7 and his wife , @entity202 , noticed that his nappies were turning black			2
they called an emergency doctor who thought the problem was caused by his mother eating red cabbage and then breastfeeding him			0
if the drug trial is successful , the treatment could become available on the @entity107 within five years			1
image shows @entity213 however , his parents were not convinced so took him to a gp who sent a range of tests to @entity221			0
when the tests were analysed , they revealed that @entity11 has @entity14 which is a genetic disorder caused by a recessive gene			2
dr @entity7 said : ‘ it took a lot of time to sink in			2
doctors told us there was nothing we could do – that was very disempowering			0
‘ it took us a while to start realising that we could do something			0
’ dr @entity7 ( pictured with @entity10 ) said : ' personally , this means hope for my kids and for all of the patients			1
we hear the most horrible stories of people having to stop work and becoming depressed because of the symptoms			0
for me , it is important my kids do n't suffer this pain ' when the couple had their second child , @entity10 , they knew there was a 25 per cent chance that he would also have the condition			0
dr @entity7 explained that after he was born , they kept checking his nappies for fear they too would go black			0
he said : ‘ we were checking @entity10 ’s nappies again and again			0
it was so sad when it happened but we try to be positive			0
‘ we are given a chance to find a cure because the disease does n’t affect them as children			0
’ for more information , visit www.developakure.eu @entity14 , also known as @entity15 ( @entity16 ) , is a rare genetic disease which causes early - onset osteoarthritis			1
it is caused by the lack of an enzyme called homogentisic dioxygenase which means that patients can not fully breakdown a toxic acid called homogentisic acid			1
as a result , the acid builds up in the body at 2,000 times the normal rate			0
the first symptom is usually black urine			0
other symptoms do not usually develop until the patient is in their 20s			0
at this stage , the patients tend to develop joint problems and back pain which is the start of osteoarthritis			2
this eventually causes the bones to become brittle and can be very disabling			0
the condition can also cause the eyeballs , sweat and earwax to turn black			0
it is thought there is also a link between aku and potentially fatal heart disease			1
this is because @entity145 causes the blood vessels and valves in the heart to harden , turning them black , brittle and less effective at managing the flow of blood around the body			2
@entity16 is caused by a genetic mutation - it is a recessive disorder meaning the @entity16 gene must be carried by both of the patient 's parents			0
if both parents are carriers , there is a 25 per cent chance of their child developing the condition			0
the condition is thought to occur in about one in every 250,000 to 500,000 people			0

@entity10 and @entity319 , 10 and 13 , have @entity14
currently they are healthy but they will start to develop *debilitating* symptoms in early adulthood unless an effective treatment is found
the disease causes severe , early - onset osteoarthritis as well as bone , urine , earwax and eyeball discolouration - can also cause heart disease
the symptoms are caused by the rapid build up of toxic acid in the body
@entity7 , the boys ' father , has given up his job as ceo of a charity to help organise a clinical trial for a drug he believes will treat the disease
if the trial is successful , the drug could be licensed and available on the @entity107 within five years
