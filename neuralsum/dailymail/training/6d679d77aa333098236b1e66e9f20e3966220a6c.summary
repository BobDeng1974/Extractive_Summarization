by @entity1 reporter published : 04:13 est , 12 january 2013 updated : 04:13 est , 12 january 2013 passengers flying from @entity3 and @entity4 face being forced to pay a ' congestion charge ' which would double the amount they would pay in tax compared to at other @entity10 airports			1
in a bid to address @entity10 's air capacity crisis , the government is exploring whether increasing passenger duty could ease congestion at the country 's two busiest airports , which are both set to reach full capacity in six years			2
in a study by @entity22 , it was found the number of passengers flying from @entity3 would fall from 23.1million a year to 18.9million if a premium rate of tax was added to fares			1
full to bursting : @entity3 is set to reach full capacity in 2019 , prompting the government to explore ways of easing congestion			1
one solution suggested is to significantly increase passenger taxes if the plans went ahead , the tax on an economy flight to @entity33 would rise to Â£ 32.50			1
a similar charge at @entity4 would see passenger departures fall from 15.1million to 12.8million in 2014 , with the knock - on effect that more passengers would use @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			0
while @entity40 backs the idea , @entity3 warned it would damage @entity10 's trade , with carriers choosing to switch to other @entity46 hubs			1
a @entity48 spokesman told the @entity49 : ' long haul flights forced out of @entity3 by the higher taxes would not go to other @entity10 airports - they would go to our @entity46 competitors in @entity55 , @entity56 or @entity57			1
congested : @entity4 is the busiest single - runway airport in the world and is set to reach full capacity in six years ' the economic growth and trade deals that come with these flights would then benefit @entity46 , not the @entity10			1
' a spokesman for the @entity65 , the business lobbying organisation , said the answer was to increase capacity , rather than force airlines and passengers away			0
' we 're already losing business to other @entity46 destinations so we ca n't kick this into the long grass , ' he told the paper			0
' we need new connections with fast - growing markets like @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 - with space for airlines to put on new flights			0
@entity41 is thought of as the existing @entity85 airport most likely to be expanded to ease @entity10 's aviation capacity crisis the @entity87 said it asked @entity22 to examine the impact of the charge , but insisted it was simply a ' research project to inform policy - making in general '			0
according to latest government projections , @entity4 will reach bursting point in 2019 , while @entity94 in east @entity85 will be full in 2021			0
the only space for expansion in @entity85 appears to be at @entity41 , which will fill up in 2028 , a year ahead of @entity39			0
@entity97 : @entity39 , popular with low - cost carriers like @entity99 , is projected to be full by 2027 a ban - signed off in 1979 - on expansion at @entity4 expires in 2019 and the airport 's owners are considering applying for a second runway to be built after that , which would double capacity to 70million passengers a year			2
a commission will present its thoughts on how @entity85 can deal with its capacity issues later this year			0
it will explore the feasibility of the so - called @entity113 airport in the @entity114 , which is the preferred option of @entity85 mayor @entity116 , or whether the government should reverse its policy on expansion of @entity85 's existing airports .			2

tax could be double to that at other airports
@entity3 warns plans would *threaten* economic growth
