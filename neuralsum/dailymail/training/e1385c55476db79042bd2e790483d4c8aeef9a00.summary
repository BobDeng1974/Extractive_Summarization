an internet troll who harassed successful sellers on @entity3 in a bid to put them out of business has been exposed after years of abuse			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , is said to be the man behind the mask who calls himself @entity13 and harasses not only the ecommerce website and @entity15 but also those who use it			1
a television reporter in @entity18 , @entity9 , hired private investigators to track down the man who targeted individual customers , sending them a torrent of threatening abuse			1
@entity13 , who has his own @entity43 channel , dedicates his time to trying to ' expose ' the internet auction site , accusing it of various crimes and wrongdoings , and talking on camera - hidden by a ghoulish @entity28 mask - about how sellers should use alternative sites			1
using voice alteration software to help keep his identity hidden , he also uses his films to accuse sellers on @entity3 of malpractice			2
it is believed @entity58 began his abuse , much of which is found on his blog ebayblows.org , after he was shut down by the site for breaking their rules			0
tv reporter @entity31 , who tracked him down , told @entity65 the scale of @entity13 's trolling stretched back several years and had been targeted at victims right across @entity69 and as far as the @entity70			1
he said : ' he has allegedly been a suspect in many trolling cases in many different forums for the last few years			0
i think he has been doing this for years and years and years			0
' there was someone from @entity77 who posted online that he had been having some kind of a war with this guy			0
' one of the troll 's targets is the successful @entity3 seller @entity84 , who expanded his @entity18 hubcab shop @entity87 's into a thriving online business			1
mr @entity84 , of @entity89 , @entity90 , became so good at selling online , he even produced videos showing other people how to do it			2
according to my @entity96 's @entity95 , @entity13 decided to target mr @entity84 , claiming he abused @entity3 's @entity98 not as described buyer 's claim , which is said to let users get a free refund on anything they buy if it is not what they were expecting			2
in one online rant , @entity13 said : ' i 'm going to ruin you in every conceivable manner			0
first i 'm going to target your @entity3 account ... ' side view : in one rant , the troll turns away from the camera , revealing shaved grey hair rather like mr @entity7 the @entity115 reporter approached this man , naming him as @entity117 , as he left the cinema silent : the man , named as @entity121 , did not reply to claims that he was the troll @entity13 and drove away no @entity124 : the thick neck of the man behind the @entity128 mask looks rather like that of mr @entity7 in another , he says : ' you are going to lose your business and i 'm going to be sitting back , laughing about it			1
' mr @entity84 told my @entity96 : ' he is sick ; he is actually sick in the head			0
' @entity31 , who was the first reporter to unmask the serial troll , says @entity13 's method is to target small business owners , outbid everyone else and then refuse to pay , so that the seller 's sale fell through			1
he would also then give the seller a bad review , something sellers on @entity3 , where reputation is everything , fear above all			2
busy online presence : the troll issues video clips decrying @entity3 , @entity15 and those who sell on @entity3 from his home the man identified as the online bully got into this truck and drove away from reporters without comment investigators hired by @entity95 identified the troll as @entity7 ' @entity7 , and after days of watching him leave his apartment only to buy lunch at @entity164 or to hit @entity165 , the reporter confronted him after he went to the cinema by himself			1
@entity95 approached the man and put it to him that he was the man behind @entity13 , a claim @entity121 , who got into his truck and drove away , did not refute			0
according to @entity171 , @entity121 seemed more concerned with his online persona , writing afterwards : ' as far as @entity13 is concerned they did nâ€™t expose anything and everything he was doing online was in fact legal			0
' mr @entity84 is said to have reported the troll to the @entity179			0
video : watch the my @entity96 report into the @entity181			0

@entity187 calls himself ebayisajoke and harasses successful sellers on the site
