they simply do not draw games , and that ’s something which could see @entity4 over the line in this season ’s race to the @entity8			1
not since late october , 21 fixtures ago , have the @entity9 shared the points			2
it ’s very much boom or bust under @entity14 and the pendulum is swinging in their direction at the moment			2
against @entity21 @entity20 ’s 15th of the season secured their eighth win in the last ten			1
the signs are ominous for the rest and one of the first words out of the manager ’s mouth afterwards was ‘ champion ’			2
why not ? they are just one point behind @entity34			0
@entity20 ( centre ) fires home to give @entity4 the lead and send them third in the @entity39 the @entity9 captain celebrates as his side continued their quest for an automatic promotion place @entity4 starting @entity44 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity45 6.5 ; @entity46 7 , @entity47 7.5 , @entity48 6 ; @entity49 6 , @entity50 8 ( @entity51 - 86 ) , @entity52 7 , @entity53 7 , @entity54 6.5 ( @entity55 - 58 6 ) ; @entity20 7.5 , @entity56 7 ( @entity57 - 68 6 ) subs not used : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , goals : @entity20 9 booked : @entity53 @entity21 starting @entity44 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity64 6 ; @entity65 6 , @entity66 6 , @entity67 6 , @entity68 6.5 ; @entity69 6 , @entity70 7 , @entity71 6.5 ( @entity72 , - 76 6 ) ; @entity73 ( @entity74 - 76 7 ) , @entity75 6.5 ( @entity76 - 66 6 ) , @entity77 7 subs not used : @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 booked : @entity65 , @entity70 ‘ it ’s nice winning 5 - 0 or 3 - 2 but sometimes it is difficult , ’ @entity14 said			1
‘ if you have a champion ’s mentality you must suffer together and get through games like this			0
‘ they caused us problems			0
it ’s positive for us because we were working all together			0
it was n’t a brilliant game but you ’ve got to be optimistic if you win these			2
’ it ’s only six months since managerial turmoil looked to undermine the foundations previously laid when @entity99 left after a matter of days but @entity4 will take some stopping from here			1
when all is said and done in two months ’ time , they will make sure not to hold any regrets			0
the winner came on nine minutes after @entity21 goalkeeper @entity64 , rather bizarrely , opted to travel away from his goal to retrieve a ball for @entity50 to whip in a wicked corner ; from that @entity46 ’s header was partially saved but @entity20 was on the spot to smash in the rebound			1
‘ @entity113 ’ was @entity112 ’ summation			0
‘ it ’s the second phase of a corner			0
’ @entity14 ’s side are top scorers in the division - netting 16 in their last five at @entity120 before this - but are occasionally susceptible to pace and @entity77 might ’ve drawn the visitors level soon after , only for his half - volley to be thwarted by former @entity124 stopper @entity45			1
@entity69 ( centre ) tussles with @entity50 for the ball during his side 's defeat to @entity4 match winner @entity20 fights with @entity129 for possession during the first half at @entity120 despite @entity21 looking bright , it was the @entity9 who could ’ve sewn the points up before half - time			1
@entity50 is afforded the freedom to roam from his central berth and that gives @entity4 an added dimension			2
capped by @entity140 , he buzzes in possession and is n’t afraid of bypassing @entity20 and @entity56 in pursuit of goals			2
here the two strikers combined brilliantly to tee @entity50 up and he thumped just wide			0
make no mistake , this was not vintage @entity4 but you sense they do n’t need to be weekly , such is the quality stacked up in a well - stocked squad			1
@entity56 crashed an effort against the bar after sparkling @entity53 footwork before @entity65 only saw yellow for raising his hands to the striker off the ball			0
@entity52 ( centre ) climbs higher than @entity73 during his side 's crucial victory over @entity21 @entity112 saw @entity75 head over from a corner and @entity163 ’s vicious strike was deflected wide			1
@entity21 failed to build a real period of sustained pressure until introducing giant striker @entity74 ; his knockdown fell to @entity77 but @entity45 rushed out , spread himself and superbly blocked the @entity168 ’s certain equaliser			1
‘ @entity74 did well when he came on , ’ @entity112 said			0
‘ he ’s a physical presence up there and we can play a bit more direct			0
there was a chance at the end when @entity76 and @entity77 got in each other ’s way			0
’ @entity4 might usually be a pleasure to watch , but they ’ll be thankful for that mad @entity181 between the sticks - this ended up being as gritty as they come .			1

@entity4 move into third in the @entity39 following the win
@entity20 opened the scoring for high - flying @entity4 after nine minutes
@entity45 made crucial saves to prevent a @entity21 equaliser
