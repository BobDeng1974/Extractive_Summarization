@entity0 can be excused if he has @entity1 on his mind as he attempts to become the first @entity4 manager to win at @entity5 since @entity6 , nearly a quarter of a century ago			1
@entity0 had been in charge of @entity8 for only a few games in february 2009 when he took his struggling team to the @entity11 and ended his team ’s 27 - year winless run in the derby			1
‘ i do n’t know how we did it , ’ said the @entity4 boss			1
‘ @entity8 were bottom and @entity1 were top , and all the people were saying @entity8 were dead and had no chance			1
@entity0 brought his unfancied @entity8 side to the @entity11 in february 2009 that @entity1 team contained stars such as @entity23 ( left ) , @entity24 and @entity25 but two goals from @entity27 ( above ) secured a famous victory for @entity0 's men at @entity1 's home ‘ it was @entity32 ’s first year and they had @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity24 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			1
we had unbelievable players , too			0
i remember @entity27 scored two			0
‘ it was the third or fourth game i was in charge and i had started to set a different style on the team			2
the plan was to press high and surprise them			0
as always , you have to be a little bit lucky , too			0
‘ it was a special victory and an unbelievable memory			2
it was very satisfying for me because i had played at @entity8 for 11 years			2
’ @entity0 , the 15th @entity4 boss since @entity6 , has not found it so easy to impose his high - energy style on the squad he inherited at @entity55 and there has been an absence of shock wins			1
spurs have spluttered , especially at home , but have won their last three games with evidence during the 2 - 1 victory against @entity64 on sunday that his message is finally getting through to the players			1
@entity5 , however , will provide a different test			2
spurs have not won at @entity69 since february 1990 and @entity71 ’s team are unbeaten in 20 games in all competitions this season			1
@entity6 was the last manager to guide @entity4 to victory at @entity5 nearly a quarter of a century ago @entity76 ( left ) celebrates with @entity77 after scoring @entity4 ' first goal against the @entity79 in 1990 they have also kept 11 clean sheets in their last 14 @entity83 home games			1
how best to crack this defensive stability will dominate @entity0 ’s selection and his greatest puzzle is whether to recall @entity87 at the expense of @entity89 or @entity90			2
@entity89 has been in terrific form and clocked more than 13 kilometres during the @entity64 game , when @entity90 scored his first league goal since march			0
it would be harsh to axe either man for @entity87 , who was left out after a dismal display at @entity97 and then reported after international duty with a hamstring problem			0
when that cleared up , he was out with a virus , but he is fit for selection now			0
@entity103 nets the equaliser against @entity64 at @entity55 on sunday @entity90 slotted home @entity4 's second as @entity0 's men clinched victory over the @entity64 @entity0 's ( right ) @entity4 are now seventh in the @entity83 as they gear up for their clash with @entity5 @entity0 is cautious going into nine games in 30 days , though			1
‘ you have to analyse the fatigue as we are playing after three days , ’ he said			0
‘ sometimes you play with two strikers , as we did against @entity64 , and you say , “ let ’s do the same ” , but we need to understand a player may need a rest			2
’ he believes the @entity118 campaign has made it harder for @entity4 to adjust to his demands because the gruelling cycle of travel and games limits training time and has prevented him from operating with a settled team			1
‘ if you are not ready , not smart to manage the squad , maybe the @entity118 kills you , ’ said @entity0 , and he claimed the recovery process was simpler if the team were winning every week , like @entity5			1
‘ it is much easier to recover because you are happy , ’ he said			0
‘ when you laugh , you recover easily			0
when you lose four games at home , it is difficult to recover easily because you are sad and you do n’t sleep			0
’ @entity0 is weighing up whether to recall @entity87 to his startling line - up @entity87 's call - up would come at the expense of either @entity89 ( left ) or @entity90 by that token , @entity5 should be raring to go tonight , but @entity71 insists he will not let the dangling carrot of an unbeaten season disrupt @entity5 ’s trophy hunt			1
@entity140 went the entire 2003 - 04 @entity83 season without losing — but fell short in the @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144			2
and @entity71 explained : ‘ one thing is , i do n’t think it ’s possible ( to go unbeaten )			2
‘ the other thing is , we are not playing for that because , if you play for that , maybe you draw too many matches , you do n’t take risks to try to win matches			0
‘ you are happy just to be undefeated			0
if you get 10 draws , you get 10 points			0
if you win five and lose five , you make 15 points			0
i ’d prefer 15 points			0
if against @entity4 we have a 0 - 0 with 20 minutes to go , we are not going to play for the 0 - 0 to be undefeated			1
@entity71 ’s team are unbeaten in 20 games in all competitions this season @entity71 's side , lead superbly by striker @entity163 ( above ) , have conquered all before them thus far			1

@entity4 have not won at @entity5 since 1990
@entity6 was the last manager to taste victory away to the @entity79
@entity0 can take *inspiration* from his time at @entity8
@entity0 took his team to the @entity11 and beat @entity1 in 2009
the result ended @entity8 ’s 27 - year winless run in the @entity178 derby
@entity0 is @entity4 's 15th boss since @entity6
@entity5 are unbeaten in 20 games in all competitions this season
