by @entity1 reporter published : 05:31 est , 3 september 2012 updated : 12:48 est , 3 september 2012 @entity2 , 21 , shows the sign language symbol for the voice			1
she has not been able to speak since february a talkative 21 - year - old is facing the prospect of never speaking again after an extreme case of laryngitis seven months ago has left her speechless			1
@entity2 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , lost her voice back in february this year 2012 after her larynx became inflamed			1
more than seven months on and her voice has yet to return with doctors warning the self - confessed ' chatterbox ' that she must now face the realistic possibility her voice may never recover			1
in an email interview she wrote : ' i am finding this all very hard as most people do n’t understand that it has affected my life a great deal			0
' most people just seem to think i am joking and they laugh or make jokes , like asking me to repeat things			0
' when i go out with people i ca n’t talk to them because they wo n’t hear me			0
' @entity27 has had to put her life on hold due to her odd ailment			1
the bubbly youngster has been forced to take sick leave from her role as a lifeguard at @entity37 gym in @entity38 , @entity10 , due to the fact she can not make herself heard to swimmers in the pool			1
she has also been left frustrated after health bosses ruled she must be without her voice for more than a year before she can receive treatment on the @entity45 or disability benefits			1
laryngitis occurs when the larynx ( or voice box ) becomes inflamed			2
this stops the vocal chords from vibrating correctly her mother @entity52 , 47 , said : ' it ’s been a nightmare for her			0
' her vocal cords are okay but the muscle at the back is damaged which is restricting her voice box from functioning properly			2
' she ’s engaged to her boyfriend @entity60 and they ’re trying to save for their own place but everything is on hold			0
' we ’re quite a loud family and @entity27 is a chatterbox but we have had to learn to stop and let her talk			1
' if we do n’t she bangs the table to be heard			0
' laryngitis is the swelling and inflammation of the voice box which means the vocal chords can not vibrate correctly causing hoarseness			2
most cases of laryngitis are caused by viral infection , such as a cold , and will usually pass within three weeks			0
however , it can also be caused by gastric reflux , allergies or overuse causing lesions to form on the vocal chords			0
these cases are more likely to prove chronic			0
each year in @entity87 around 250 people are referred to hospital consultants for chronic laryngitis			2
common treatments include vocal rest , increasing fluid intake , humidity , and voice therapy .			2

@entity27 has had to give up her *job* as a lifeguard as she can not communicate with swimmers
she can not receive disability benefits until she has had no voice for a year
