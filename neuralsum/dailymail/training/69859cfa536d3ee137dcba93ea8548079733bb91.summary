a fire chief has caused outrage after striking a deal to quit his £ 200,000 - a - year post , receive an estimated £ 700,000 payoff and then walk straight back into his former job			0
@entity7 commissioner @entity6 has been allowed to ‘ retire ’ and gain access to his pension entitlements – giving him a maximum of £ 133,000 a year , two thirds of his salary			1
but the 52 - year - old has been instantly re-employed into his old position , albeit on lower pay			2
laughing all the way to the bank : @entity6 ( far left ) , shares a joke with metropolitan police commissioner sir @entity19 and mayor @entity20 his total earnings are now likely to be close to what they were before he retired			1
the deal has sparked fury from the @entity27 , which has branded it ‘ deeply unethical ’ at a time when many firefighters are facing job cuts and pay freezes			1
officials believe mr @entity6 has been allowed to dodge any future cuts to pensions and increases in tax to his lump sum by being allowed to leave early			1
they are also angry that he was allowed to walk back into his old post without other candidates being considered for the position			0
payout : london fire commissioner @entity6 retired with a generous payout only to walk back into his old job the press and the public were asked to leave a meeting of the fire authority before the retirement and re-employment of mr @entity6 were discussed under an item listed as ‘ continuity arrangements ’			1
@entity52 , regional official of the union , said : ‘ it appears deeply unethical for a deal like this to be hammered out in secret at a time when ordinary firefighters are suffering tough austerity measures			0
‘ when firefighters are subject to a pay freeze and 25 per cent cuts in spending , this is obscene			1
‘ it shows there ’s one rule for fat cats and another for the rest of us			0
‘ this kind of decision should be made in public so that it can be properly scrutinised instead of being made in a cloak and dagger way			0
’ @entity77 , of the @entity76 , said : ‘ this practice of double - dipping – claiming pay and a pension – has happened in other parts of the public sector and is costing taxpayers dearly			2
’ the firefighters ’ pension scheme allows for a two - thirds salary pension , which would give mr @entity6 £ 133,333 annually , based on his final salary of around £ 200,000 a year			1
workers may convert up to quarter of their pension into a lump sum called a ‘ commutation ’ – which would allow mr @entity6 to draw £ 716,000			1
if he takes this , his annual pension would be reduced to about £ 100,000			0
last night a @entity7 spokesman declined to discuss the figures , but insisted the move represented a ‘ cost saving ’ because of mr @entity6 ’s lower salary			1
it ensured a highly regarded commissioner was in office during the run - up to the @entity105 and beyond , he added			2
mr @entity6 is married with three children and oversees 7,000 staff in the world ’s third - largest fire and rescue service			2
he joined in 1979 and became commissioner in 2007			0

under a three - year contract , he was unable to touch his £ 75,000 annual pension			0
at the time , he said : ‘ people need to understand it ’s not taxpayers ’ money – it ’s my private pension			0
