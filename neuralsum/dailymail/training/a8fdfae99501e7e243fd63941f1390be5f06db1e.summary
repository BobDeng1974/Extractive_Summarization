by @entity0 and @entity1 created 10:15 am on 20th october 2011 she should be in the prime of her career , posing for magazine shoots instead of prison mugshots			0
but @entity7 has been subject to her fifth mugshot in just four years at the tender age of 25			2
today , a tearful @entity7 was led away from court in handcuffs and taken into custody after a judge blasted her for violating probation			1
booked : this photo was taken after @entity7 was taken into custody , making it the fifth mugshot of her life the troubled actress previously had the embarrassing photographs taken on july 24 and november 15 of 2007 and later again on july 20 and september 24 of 2010			2
the first mugshot was taken three weeks before filming was scheduled to resume on @entity24 , when @entity7 was arrested for a second @entity25 and ordered to return to rehab			2
the second was when she served a grand total of 84 minutes behind bars following her @entity25			0
her third photograph came after she violated the terms of her probation and was sentenced to 90 days in jail - she served just 14			0
the fourth came after her probation was revoked following a failed drug test , just before attending the @entity36 for three months until early january 2011			0
welling up : @entity7 appeared in a @entity38 courtroom today where a judge revoked her probation and ordered her into custody @entity7 has had her latest probation revoked pending a november 2 hearing after judge @entity43 slammed her for failing to complete time at the @entity45			1
the @entity47 star is now understood to have been released after posting $ 100,000 and will not spend time behind bars - for now , at least			1
the outcome is pending the november hearing , which was scheduled by the judge today , where the court will hear further testimonies before deciding on the course of action			2
becoming a habit : @entity7 is getting quite acquainted with the orange jumpsuit as she posed for police mugshots on september 24 and july 20 last year still pouting : despite the severity of the situation , the actress managed to look photogenic during her mugshots on november 15 and july 24 2007 @entity7 was formally arrested in court today and taken into custody after @entity43 revoked her probation			1
on her booking sheet , the @entity66 accidentally listed her sex as male , and detailed how she weighed 116lbs			1
@entity43 said @entity70 should serve 16 hours at the morgue on clean - up duty between now and her next court hearing in an attempt to mitigate the current situation			1
cuffed : @entity7 was led away in handcuffs and taken into custody after the hearing			2
it is likely she will post bail and be released by the end of the day the actress had been sentenced to 480 hours community service earlier this year as part of her punishment for stealing a gold necklace from a jewellery store			1
during the hearing , @entity43 asserted @entity7 had managed to wilfully get herself kicked off the programme by cancelling on the women 's centre nine times			2
faces of pain : @entity7 was her usually - animated self during today 's hearing making an impression : @entity7 arrived to court in an eggshell blue dress and gold peep - toe heels , teamed with a @entity101 handbag , but was sporting rather heavy - handed make - up @entity7 welled up as her lawyer @entity103 fought her corner , pointing to the ' glowing report ' by the @entity106			1
but despite @entity7 completing some volunteer work this week at the @entity109 , the judge ruled it as void because it was not part of the sentence she had specifically stipulated at an earlier hearing			1
she says @entity7 should have gone to the morgue for clean - up duty to complete some of the hours of community service instead - which was the second part of the probation @entity43 had originally stipulated			1
' nobody has the power to change my sentence , ' said an incredulous @entity43			0
frenzy : the actress was greeted by an army of photographers as she arrived at the @entity129 fighting her corner : she was represented by her lawyer @entity103 packing punch after punch , an unimpressed @entity43 told @entity7 : ' probation is a gift as i see it			2
there is something called looking a gift horse in the mouth			0
' @entity43 was also perplexed as to why the @entity106 had given @entity7 such a positive report			0
she said her work this week at the @entity109 would not count towards the 60 days of community service @entity7 has been ordered to complete			0
@entity43 also estimated that @entity7 has only managed to fulfil three days out of the 60 so far , also taking into account the time taken to complete a shoplifters course			2
she noted that @entity7 had been a no - show at the women 's centre nine times and had only managed to do around a day - and - a - half there			2
in the spotligh : teams of paparazzi and tv camera crews were on hand to capture the actress 's arrival and departure back home : @entity7 returns to her @entity159 home in @entity160 after a dramatic day @entity43 suggested it was @entity7 's inability to keep to schedule and disruption of the programme that eventually left women 's centre with no option but to cancel her role there			1
the star pulled up to the courthouse at 9.55am for the 10am hearing at the @entity171			0
dressed in an eggshell blue dress and white scarf , the actress was also sporting rather heavy handed make - up			0
she had her hair tied back in a ponytail and stepped out of her black @entity178 to a barrage of flashbulbs			0
the @entity47 actress has also served 35 days under house arrest this year as part of her sentence for the necklace theft			1
pulling no punches : judge @entity43 revoked @entity7 's probation pending a hearing arrest : @entity7 's sex is incorrectly listed as ' male ' on her booking sheet processed today following her court appearance the actress ' once promising movie career has been derailed by multiple trips to jail and rehab since 2007			1
the judge dismissed @entity7 's lawyer @entity200 's argument that the actress had to go abroad to work , where she has been seen partying over recent weeks in @entity203			1
' she is supposed to be an actress from what i hear , ' @entity43 said			0
@entity200 admitted that ' unfortunately ' @entity7 's career opportunity are not in @entity207 right now and that she has been to @entity203 to earn money to support herself and her family			1
but @entity43 was more concerned about the logistics of how @entity7 had attended weekly appointments with her @entity207 - based shrink , which was part of the terms of her probation			2
while the psychological report said she had attended every week , @entity43 was doubtful , pointing to the time frames of @entity7 's flights between various @entity203 destinations			1
judge @entity43 was sceptical about the glowing report written about @entity221			0
in the documents , the actress ' probation officer says her psychotherapist believes she is ' doing really well , she is making changes , and is trying to become more disciplined in her actions ' and that she is ' turning her life around '			0
the report also says she has been going to therapy every week , which the judge disputed because of @entity7 's travels overseas			1
the report details how @entity7 said the women 's shelter community service was not ' fulfilling ' - which was also slammed by the judge troubled : @entity7 and her bail bondsman will now have to deal with the paperwork to get her released from custody familiar scene : an outside view of the @entity129 in @entity38 where @entity7 attended today @entity7 was given a leave of absence from her shoplifting course to have emergency dental work done			1
it came just two days after her red carpet appearance in @entity38 where she displayed shockingly discoloured teeth			0
the actress 's probation report detailed various dates of her excused absences from probation , including october 14 for a trip to the dentist			0
' ms. @entity7 has not been absent to any regularly scheduled activities , except the session scheduled for her on friday , october 14 , 2011 due to her need to seek dental work , ' the report stated			0
' @entity262 presented evidence of attending her dentist office			0
as a result her absence was excused			0
' @entity7 now has her @entity268 smile back in place after having her teeth fixed			0
before and after : @entity7 's discoloured teeth , left , were transformed to pearly white just a week later			1
