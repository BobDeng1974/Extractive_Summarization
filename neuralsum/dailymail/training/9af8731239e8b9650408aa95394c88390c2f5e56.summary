finding a parking space close to your destination in a busy city centre can often be a challenge , but car manufacturer @entity5 has a solution - by bringing parts of your car together to make a collapsible bicycle			1
the car giant has revealed designs for a collapsible bike that can be built by scavenging components from their vehicles			1
the design incorporates the car jack as pedals of the bike , makes use of the car 's spare tyre as wheels and even turns a removable headrest into a bicycle seat			1
@entity5 's new design ( above ) shows how a collapsible bike can be put together using components from a car the company hopes the bike could help make it easier for commuters and for motorists in towns and cities where parking can be difficult			1
on top of its car business , @entity5 has recently been branching out into the bike market			1
in 2011 it unveiled designs for an electric bike that was capable of travelling 50 miles on just one charge			0
the e-bike used hi - tech magnetic sensors from its f1 vehicles to produce a motor that responds in just 1/100th of a second			0
it also stored batteries inside the aluminum frame of the bike			2
a concept of the bike weighed just 5.5lb ( 2.5kg )			0
in 2013 @entity5 teamed up with @entity51 to produce a new electric bike called the @entity53			2
the bike could also provide an emergency form of transport for if a car runs out of fuel - allowing the driver to ride to the closest petrol station to get more			2
@entity5 revealed its plans in a new patent application that has just been published			2
in it the company said : ' mobility in urban areas becomes increasingly difficult with population growth since increasing the infrastructure to accommodate a larger population can be difficult			0
' for example , adding roads or increasing the size of existing roads to accommodate more passenger vehicles in urban areas can be onerous			0
' even if more roads were added and existing roads expanded , commuters to urban areas may nevertheless encounter increased pollution and parking shortages			0
' the patent suggests that to combat this , future motor vehicles could contain components that have dual uses			0
@entity5 's patent envisages the bike will be incorporated into the body of its popular cars like the @entity89 above the patent says the bike will collapse ( as above ) to make it easy to store when commuters reach the office it suggests that a basic bike frame made from aluminum , titanium , carbon fibre or even bamboo could be incorporated into the body of a car			1
@entity5 proposes using a new type of spare wheel in the car that can be broken into two halves to provide the front and back wheels of the bike			1
the jack , stored in the boot of the vehicle , could also be switched to pedals			1
one of these will contain cogs that will convert the pedaling action into forward motion			0
removable headrests from inside the car could be made from gel or foam padding coated in nylon or carbon fibre to produce a comfortable bike seat			1
headrests in the car made from gel or foam can be removed and attached to the bike frame to form a seat the wheels of the bike ( above ) can be locked together to form a single spare car tyre according to the patent the patent said : ' the bicycle includes components that can also be used in a vehicles such as a car , truck or sports utility vehicle			1
' the rear wheel and the front wheel may be fixed to one another for use in a spare wheel in a vehicle or separated for use in the bicycle			1
' the seat may be used as a headrest in the vehicle			0
the drive mechanism may be used as a jack to at least partially lift the vehicle during maintenance			2
' moreover , the frame may be collapsible so that it may be easily stored in the vehicle when the bicycle is not in use			1
' additionally , a collapsible frame may allow the rider to conveniently store the bicycle in an ultimate destination such as an office			0
' the patent was lodged by @entity160 - a subsidiary of the @entity161 that handles its intellectual property			0
in 2013 @entity5 announced it had signed a deal with folding bicycle maker @entity164 , raising the prospect that the two firm may be working together to develop new types of bikes			2
@entity5 did not respond when contacted to comment on the patent .			0

car giant has designed a bicycle that can be stored in the body of a vehicle
it plans to make the spare wheel spit into two to make a front and back tyre
the car jack can both lift the vehicle but also can be turned into bike pedals
removable headrests in the car can be added to the bike frame as a seat
@entity5 says the design will make it easier for commuters to get around cities
