they came to see the great @entity1 deliver the @entity2 ending to his record - breaking career , but instead it was left to a jockey previously regarded as a popular journeyman to secure his place in @entity9 folklore by winning the @entity11 ’s @entity10			1
having won last year ’s race on @entity13 , 38 - year - old @entity14 , who once walked away from the sport for 18 months after becoming disillusioned , became the first rider since @entity18 , who won on @entity19 and @entity20 in 1953 and 1954 , to land the biggest jumps race of the year in successive years on different horses			1
how grateful he is now that that spell away recharged his batteries			0
many clouds was a third winner of the race for owner @entity29			0
the man who owns both @entity31 and @entity32 has also won the race with @entity34 in 2005 and @entity35 in 2011			2
many clouds , ridden by @entity14 , jumps a fence on the way to winning the @entity10 at @entity9 @entity1 on @entity39 ( left ) congratulates @entity14 after @entity41 ' victory on saturday while the gelding , whose participation in the race had been in doubt after his disappointing sixth in the @entity48 last month , also provided a massive change of national luck for his @entity52 trainer @entity51			1
none of his four previous runners in the race had managed to complete the course and two of them — 1988 favourite @entity60 and @entity62 in 2010 — had fallen at the first fence			0
many clouds passed the line one - and - three - quarter lengths in front of @entity68 - trained 33 - 1 shot @entity69 , with 40 - 1 chance @entity70 running a massive race in third for his trainer @entity73 and his trio of former international rugby - playing owners @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			1
in fourth for the second year running was @entity82 ’s @entity81 , whose finishing position meant jockey @entity84 has remarkably been placed seven times in the race			2
but he never had a chance to lay a glove on @entity14 and many clouds , who had struck for home well before the home straight			1
one of the first to congratulate the winning jockey was @entity1			1
@entity14 said : ‘ he is as good in defeat as he is when he is winning			1
i think the only people here happy he has been beaten are me and @entity96 [ the supremo at @entity97 where @entity1 will now end his career on april 25 ]			1
i ca n’t imagine what this place would have been like if he had won			2
‘ last year i had to work hard at certain points of the race and i was a very tired man at the end but this time it was very smooth			0
’ winning jockey @entity14 holds up the @entity10 trophy as the 38 - year - old celebrates a famous victory many clouds won the @entity10 for trainer @entity51 ( centre ) and last year 's winning jockey @entity14 if @entity14 was not fatigued , his mount certainly was and @entity41 had to be dismounted on the track on welfare grounds to aid a speedy recovery in the wash - down area			1
he was later paraded in front of the grandstands after the final race of the day			2
resurgent trainer @entity51 , whose wife @entity119 rode @entity120 and pulled up in the 1989 race , added : ‘ he was foot - perfect , i do n’t think that he made a mistake			2
‘ i thought that the race was a year too soon and @entity29 knows that			0
it was his decision to run			0
‘ it was n’t my decision , so he must get all the credit , not me			0
i am in cloud cuckoo land			2
’ “ to this day , i do n’t know what happened in the @entity48 - he did n’t run his race			0
‘ something was n’t right that day , maybe he got out of bed the wrong side			0
‘ i have done nothing with him since the @entity48 , just literally one school and he has n’t seen a national fence on purpose			0
all we have done just to freshen him up			0
’ nineteen of the 39 starters finished the race and all horses emerged unscathed , although @entity144 was still under veterinary observation last night after a heavy fall at the first @entity147 which caused the fence to be bypassed by the field on the second circuit			2
@entity14 , riding many clouds ( right ) , goes toe - to - toe with second placed @entity69 ( centre ) along the final straight last year 's winning jockey @entity14 celebrates his victory as @entity41 slows to a halt after the race early exits included @entity160 , one of three to get no further than the first fence , and @entity162 , who fell at the fifth			1
if there was an unlucky horse in the race it had to be the @entity169 , who was bowling along powerfully in the lead under @entity171 when falling at the 26th fence			0
by then the writing was on the wall for well - backed 8 - 1 shot @entity175 , who faded into 17th , and last year ’s winner @entity13 , this time ridden to 12th place by @entity180			1
but there still seemed a big chance of glory for @entity1 , who had positioned @entity184 close behind the leaders throughout			1
@entity1 said : ‘ he ran a blinder			1
i was delighted with him			0
he was just a little fresh and did n’t get home			0
’ the @entity9 course , packed to the rafters with 72,000 fans , has been the backdrop to some remarkable stories in its long history and many had arrived in this suburb of @entity199 with both hope and expectations of witnessing a piece of sporting folklore unfolding			2
winning horse @entity41 is doused with water shortly after winning the @entity10 in @entity199 many clouds ( far right ) leaps over the water jump during the @entity10 at @entity9 on saturday afternoon the mass plunge predicted by the bookmakers on @entity1 ’s mount did n’t quite materialise and his failure to secure the 4,348th victory of his career on the @entity215 - trained 6 - 1 favourite saved the bookmakers up to £ 50 @entity217 had predicted successful @entity1 and @entity218 , carrying the money of thousands of once - a - year punters would cost them in the region of £ 50million			1
there had even been speculation that some firms might have been so dented by the avalanche of bets on the retiring hero that they will have to issue profit warning come monday morning			0
instead of profit warnings being issued on monday morning , the sound of popping champagne corks will be echoing around boardrooms			0
@entity235 of @entity236 said : ‘ the victory of many clouds would certainly have been cheered by some punters , but we have absolutely no complaints about the result , and would place it in the “ very good ” category			2
’ a disappointed @entity1 after finishing fifth in his final @entity10 before retiring @entity1 opens the newly named @entity1 's bar before the race on saturday before racing , @entity1 , inducted into the @entity247 on thursday , had been honoured when the bar created out of the old weighing room was renamed in his honour			1
on saturday may not have gone to script but , for years to come in @entity1 ’s , they will toast the patron saint of punters and his never - say - die attitude			1
@entity257 would argue his achievements make him worthy of mention in the same breath as the great @entity262 batsman sir @entity261 , who , back in 1948 , needed to score only four runs in his final test innings to end with a batting average of 100			0
he was out for a second - ball duck — an example of just how hard it is to script the perfect denouement			0
driving away from @entity9 last night , the great @entity1 will have known exactly how @entity261 must have felt .			1

cloud nine ridden by @entity14 won the @entity10 at @entity9
@entity1 finished fifth on @entity39 in his final ever @entity10
@entity14 has won two years running after 2014 success on @entity13
@entity69 finished second while @entity70 made up the top three
@entity14 said @entity1 is as good in defeat as he is when he is winning
