by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson watching @entity3 slam home two more penalties on his way to eight goals in three games on tuesday night it occurred to me just how much of a certainty it is that he will score every time @entity13 are awarded a spot - kick			1
you could hang a couple of car tyres from the cross-bar , tell him the goal will only count if he puts the ball through one of them , then put two goalkeepers on the line … and he would still bury it			0
‘ it ’s not normal ’ is what so many rival coaches have said about him since he embarked on his one - man quest to become @entity13 ’s all - time top goal scorer five years ago			1
and no , it is n’t normal			0
@entity3 ( right ) is congratulated by @entity13 team - mate @entity32 after scoring against @entity33 ronaldo scores from the penalty spot to put @entity13 2 - 1 up against @entity33 on tuesday night @entity3 rises above the @entity33 defence to head the ball into the net for @entity13 's third goal @entity40 , long before he was @entity41 manager , once commented that what made @entity43 so incredible was not so much what he did , because all players are capable of a mazy dribble and a clever lobbed finish ; especially in training or when they are developing as youngsters playing against players who are far inferior and who will never make the grade			1
no , the incredible thing about @entity43 was that he did it against great players in big games and he did it all the time , every week			2
he made fellow professionals look like the ‘ not - very good ’ kids in the playground			2
that is exactly what @entity3 does			1
take a top - flight keeper who week - in , week - out makes great saves and against the @entity68 football becomes a game of fetch – fetch the ball from the back of the net			1
commanding central defenders are reduced to spectators in the penalty area as he leaps to head home another cross			0
full backs look slow as he powers past them			0
that ability to be the perfect winger and the perfect centre forward in one player is another thing that makes him stand out			0
ronaldo scores another goal from the penalty spot in @entity13 's 5 - 1 @entity92 victory over @entity33 @entity3 's four goals against @entity33 took his tally this season to 12 in eight games @entity3 points to the sky after scoring his fourth goal at the @entity99 on tuesday night here are just some of the records @entity3 currently holds : forget for one moment the debate about him being the greatest player , is there a better header of the ball in world football at the moment ? almost definitely not			1
some players have the spring , some have the direction in the header , the timing , the ability to hang in the air – @entity3 has the lot			2
then there is the desire to score as many goals as possible in every game			0
the fury when he misses a late chance to score a fifth			0
the wild celebration that greeted his insignificant fourth in the @entity128 final against @entity129 in @entity130 last year			0
but for @entity3 there is no such thing as an insignificant goal			2
each one counts , every strike is another chip chiselled out of the block of stone from which he is making a statue of himself that will stand outside the @entity141 long after he retires			0
only injury or a move away in the next couple of seasons will prevent him from becoming the club ’s all - time top scorer and if he wins another @entity128 someone who is every bit as important to them as @entity151 was			1
ronaldo waves to the @entity13 supporters at his unveiling in 2009 as @entity155 ( back ) watches on @entity3 walks out in front of a a @entity157 in 2009 as thousands turn out to welcome him @entity3 ( right ) celebrates after scoring against @entity129 in last season 's @entity128 final years @entity161 2002 - 2003 @entity162 31 5 2003 - 2009 @entity163 292 118 2009 - @entity13 254 264 2003 - @entity164 114 50 is he the club ’s greatest goalscorer of all time ? if he scores more than anyone else surely that argument will be settled ? there will always be those who argue it is easy to score in the current @entity176 league with its huge gulfs in budget between teams			1
but @entity176 football has dominated @entity182 competition in recent years with @entity129 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 all making their mark			0
in the last 10 years six @entity189 - winning clubs have hailed from @entity176			0
it ’s not a two - team affair and @entity3 has scored against everybody			1
@entity3 takes his shirt off in celebration after scoring to seal @entity13 's @entity128 victory in may @entity3 receives the 2013 @entity197 award at the @entity198 in @entity199 at the start of this year it ’s true there are a couple of featherweights at the bottom of the table , sides against which the last 10 minutes of matches can resemble monday morning shooting practice but , all the same , such opponents still need to be beaten into submission and invariably it ’s @entity3 who has gleefully performed that task			1
with stories of a possible return to @entity163 some commentators last week raised eyebrows at the idea of signing @entity3 aged 30 ( as he will be next year )			1
can anyone see the decline ? does he not look physically just the same as he did five years ago			0
there is no reason why he ca n’t remain at his peak for another five years			0
five more frightening years to add to the 25 hat - tricks and the 264 goals in 254 games			1
@entity227 is the club ’s current top scorer on 323 goals			1
it took him 15 seasons and 741 games			0
@entity227 was a great player			2
@entity3 makes the greatness of others look ordinary			2
@entity237 vindicated as @entity3 scores four			2

@entity3 scored four goals in @entity13 's 5 - 1 @entity92 victory against @entity33 on tuesday
it takes his tally at @entity13 to 264 goals in 254 *appearances* since *joining* the club in 2009
the 29 - year - old is on course to *overtake* @entity227 and become @entity13 's all - time top goalscorer
@entity3 has scored seven goals in two matches , with two hat - tricks
