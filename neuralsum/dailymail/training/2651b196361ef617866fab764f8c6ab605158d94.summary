a hapless team of @entity2 cyber terrorists whose aim is to hack websites belonging to the world 's biggest governments and businesses have mistakenly hijacked @entity9 's online bus timetable			1
a group calling themselves darkshadow - an ' @entity11 ' - took over the @entity13 website and replaced it with a sinister @entity15 - style homepage			2
it is believed the gang though it was an influential site used by millions to book travel around the western world - not a @entity22 journey planner			1
blunder : a gang of @entity2 hackers , believed to be based in @entity26 , hacked a @entity22 bus timetable site believing it was an influential journey planner used across the western world its users were shocked on @entity31 when they tried to find out the latest bus and rail times but were met with a black @entity35 banner with the message ' hacked by darkshadow ' , ' @entity38 ( sic ) hackers '			1
however , rather than bringing the @entity22 to the brink of meltdown , it briefly deprived users of travel and congestion information in the @entity9 area			1
arabic music often used on propaganda films used by groups like @entity49 also blasted out of their speakers			0
the small - scale attack was roundly mocked by bus and rail users via the group ’s facebook page			1
several people began contacting the hackers asking them for travel advice in and around @entity9 but are yet to get a response			2
the site is now back in the hands of @entity13 after bus and train travellers were unable to access the timetables throughout @entity31			1
the ' darkshadow ' group 's @entity67 page claims they have previously successfully infiltrated webpages belonging to @entity70 and the @entity72 government			2
but their latest botched attack has been mocked by people via their @entity67 page			0
spot the difference : @entity22 travel bosses have since managed to wrestle back control of the @entity13 site upset : people wanting to find out the best way around @entity9 on @entity31 were shocked to see an @entity35 black flag when they tried to log on warning : when users @entity13 they still get the message that it has been hacked @entity67 user @entity86 wrote : ‘ these idiots are the laughing stock of the world			1
are the buses running today ? ’ another called @entity91 commented : ‘ can you fix this little error on the @entity13 site ? @entity96 music by the way			0
’ one person asked : ' hi			0
can you tell me which bus to get from the station to travel to the city centre ? it seems as though you 're now giving travel information '			1
one person wrote : ' oh dear , ca n't tell the difference between a local bus company and travel site ! pathetic			0
' @entity109 added : ' it 's a bus timetable website			0
too hard to hack something big			0
' the @entity13 website usually provides locals with information about train and bus times in and around @entity9			1
the @entity67 page left on the jammed site says the hackers are based in the @entity26 capital of @entity121 in @entity122			0
they appear to target two or three global travel websites all over the world every day			2
as well as posting their triumphs , the group also upload a series of posts praising @entity130			0
one said : ' swear to god but @entity130 is the @entity132 and his prophets is @entity134			0

' @entity11 ' @entity137 's aim is to *disrupt* major websites
@entity140 ' in @entity13 for western world rather than @entity22
users trying to find @entity9 bus times were met with @entity35 black flag
cyber gang 's facebook page *inundated* with requests for travel information
*travelwest* down on @entity31 but now back in hands of business
