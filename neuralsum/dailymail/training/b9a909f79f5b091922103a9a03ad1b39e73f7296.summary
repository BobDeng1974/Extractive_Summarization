by @entity0 published : 14:26 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 03:22 est , 23 august 2013 they say you should never smile at a crocodile - and you certainly ca n't get friendly with one			2
but this leopard proved otherwise as he joined one of the huge reptiles for a chow - down on an impala			0
seemingly undaunted by the scaly creature 's massive , bone - crushing jaws , the big cat got stuck into the blood - stained carcass - and amazingly , the croc seemed happy to share its kill			2
after a few cautious sniffs , it apparently decided this was a dinner date for two , and took a big bite - inches from the croc 's jaws			1
crocodiles have been known to kill leopards , but this easy - going animal simply continued to gnaw on its prey with nothing but a brief - though disgruntled - glance at the big cat			1
but some meals are best left to one and after a few minutes , the crocodile gathered up its now considerably smaller impala and headed off down the road			0
the leopard - now joined by another of his species , who clearly wanted to see what the fuss was about - had apparently had his fill , and watched the croc lumber off into the distance			0
the amazing sight of the two animals devouring the slaughtered impala together was captured by photographers who were taking part in a @entity75 tour in @entity21 , @entity76 , @entity77			1
@entity78 : the leopard inches ever closer to the carcass to take his first bite ... while the crocodile turns its bloodstained head to face the big cat sharing platter : the daring leopard delves in for a bite of the grizzly flesh , undaunted by the razor - sharp crocodile jaws just inches away plat du jour : the two animals now seem content to share the carcass by the side of the road in the nature reserve in @entity76 , @entity77 cordon bleu : now both smeared with impala blood , the animals continue to enjoy their meal , seemingly oblivious to photographers park rangers have identified ten different leopards in and around the camps in the park , which boasts one of the greatest concentrations of animal life in @entity108			1
sightings of more than 200 crocodiles on hunts or basking in the sun have been reported			0
@entity113 are the most numerous animal in the park , which also boasts 14 different antelope species			0
the park is also home to 60 different species of animals including hippo , buffalo , giraffes , zebras and waterbuck , and close to 400 bird species			0
munch bunch : nile crocodiles are usually between 11 and 17ft long - although some 22ft specimens have been reported - but this does n't seem to bother a hungry leopard easy pickings : leopards are extremely agile , stealthy hunters , but scavenging often provides them with a ready - made meal three 's a crowd : a second leopard is too late for the feast as the crocodile finally makes off with the remnants of its kill lethal : the @entity142 boasts an extraordinary number of @entity24 crocodiles , with hundreds gathering at a time to hunt or bask in the sun			1
