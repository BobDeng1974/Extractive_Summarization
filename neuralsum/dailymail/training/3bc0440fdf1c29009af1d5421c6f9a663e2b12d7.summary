it was teeth poking through the mud that caught an amateur fossil hunter ’s attention			0
the sight led @entity6 to discover the remains of a prehistoric rhino on a @entity10 beach , after the cliffs were eroded by stormy weather			1
he came across the two rows of teeth at the foot of the cliffs at @entity17 beach , which are thought to belong to a species of rhino that roamed the area around 700,000 years ago			1
mr @entity33 spent a day carefully removing the fossil by covering the exposed area with plaster of @entity39 before cutting around it			0
the remains , which were uncovered last week , date from the @entity42 interglacial period - some 700,000 years ago			1
the period is named after @entity44 , in @entity10			2
@entity6 ( pictured left ) discovered the remains of a prehistoric rhino on a @entity10 beach , after the cliffs were eroded by stormy weather			1
local geologist @entity33 stepped in to carefully remove the remains ( pictured right ) which were at risk of being washed away experts are working to determine which species of rhino the bones come from , but mr @entity33 thinks they are likely from to the @entity55			1
a mounted skeleton of the ancient species is shown @entity55 is an extinct genus of rhinoceros native to northern @entity60 that lived during the @entity61 to @entity63 epoch			2
an expert estimates the remains found in @entity10 are around 700,000 years old			1
the prehistoric rhino had two horns and weighed over 6,613lbs ( 3,000kg )			0
it measured around seven ft ( two metres ) tall and 13 ft ( four metres ) long - a similar size to a white rhino			0
there were two species of @entity55 living in @entity60 at the time , but the remains are thought to belong to the species with a narrower nose			1
@entity55 was an unspecialised animal evolved for browsing rather than grazing , while @entity77 , with its wider nose , preferred forest and woodland habitats			2
they include two rows of teeth , some eroded parts of the skull or jaws , and bone that could be from the ribs			0
experts are working to determine exactly which species of ancient rhino the bones come from , but mr @entity33 thinks they are likely from to the @entity55 hundsheimensis species			1
he said : ‘ they ranged across @entity94 and were adapted more for browsing rather than for grazing			0
’ one of the most complete skeletons of a mammoth ever found was uncovered on the same area of beach in 1990			2
‘ anything found in the @entity102 is significant , ’ said mr @entity33 , former curator of @entity100			0
‘ it is another piece in the jigsaw of what @entity106 was like 700,000 years ago			1
‘ it was in danger of being washed away			0
i had to ensure i rescued it before the tide washed it away			0
’ mr @entity33 , 63 , who now runs a microbrewery , added : ‘ mr @entity6 is quite experienced in collecting fossils - i would like to see him involved in the process of analysing and preserving it			0
‘ the ideal outcome would be for the findings to be donated to a public collection			0
’ mr @entity6 found a rhino bone in the same area in 2012 and mr @entity33 discovered tooth rows from another rhino and an even older rhino femur in the 1980s and early 1990s			2

thought to belong to rhino species @entity55
creature roamed the area 700,000 years ago , browsing for food
