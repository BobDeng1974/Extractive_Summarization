often , even in premium brands , it is only the protectors that are certified , not the rest of the garment			0
' it is great to see that with @entity0 's motorcycling jacket and trousers , safety does not have to come with a high price tag			2
' the motorcycling range comes after a whole host of specialist ranges launched by the supermarket - from @entity94 and fishing gear , to yoga and even ski clothing and accessories			2
