judge @entity0 said viewing online porn gave the boy , now 16 , a ' skewed ' view of women and helped turn him into a predator a schoolboy turned into a vicious sexual predator after getting hooked on hardcore online pornography when he was just 12 years old , a court has heard			1
the boy , now 16 , sexually abused one girl aged 11 , another aged 13 , and went on to bully a 12 - year - old into sending him explicit pictures of herself via @entity15			1
judge @entity0 , at @entity16 , was told the boy 's attacks started after he began watching porn on the family computer at his @entity22 home			1
mr @entity0 said the disturbing images , which were viewed before the boy hit puberty , had warped his understanding of women and sex , and turned him into a predator			1
mr @entity30 , prosecuting , said the boy committed his first offence aged 12 after viewing pornography during a troubled period for his family			1
he assaulted an 11 - year - old after forcing his hands down her trousers and touching her			1
despite the girl 's protests the boy convinced himself she wanted him to do it , and told friends afterwards that she was ' begging for it ' , mr @entity30 said			1
aged 14 he attacked a 13 - year - old girl after getting her drunk on a camping trip , and used @entity15 to pressure another 12 - year - old into sending him explicit pictures of herself			1
she initially refused , but after he accused her of being frigid she agreed to pose in her underwear			0
however he kept pressuring her into sending more and more explicit images of herself with a deodorant can			2
the court heard that all of the girls had been left emotionally devastated after the attacks , with one woman describing her daughter as ' an emotional wreck '			0
another of his victims began self harming after she was teased at school and called a ' slag '			2
mr @entity0 sentenced the boy to a two - year long series of classes to adjust his sexist attitude to women , and banned him from accessing pornography under a @entity73			1
@entity74 @entity16 heard the boy sexually assaulted an 11 - year - old girl when he was 12 by putting his hand down her trousers , and attacked a 13 - year - old after getting her drunk on a camping trip when he was 14 the order means he is banned from visiting explicit sites , and is also banned from deleting his internet history			1
officers are allowed to examine his computer at any time , and if they find information is missing he can be taken back to court			0
the maximum penalty for a breach is five years in jail			2
mr @entity0 said : ' what shines through in this case is that at the age of 12 you gained access to pornography , before you committed these offences , and it was at that time your difficulties began			2
' when one thinks of the impact of that on a 12 - year - old mind and on someone in a vulnerable position , it really makes one uncomfortably aware just how easy it is to access pornography , even for somebody very young			1
the boy is now banned from explicit websites , can not delete his internet history , and must consent to police searches of his computer ' unless anybody has knowledge of what is happening , it is very difficult to do something about it			1
i take note of the fact the government is engaging with internet service providers and this case highlights the need for that			0
' every day people are accessing mainstream pornography which can have a detrimental effect on children and young people			0
' the @entity133 â€™s report concludes this offending started very shortly after you started watching this material at a time before puberty			0
' it is very likely to have led to a skewed attitude towards women when you went through puberty and it is difficult to avoid the conclusion it formed the background to this offending			0
' having said that , it was serious sexual offending which has been very damaging for the victims who have not only suffered directly but through online bullying by people who know you			0
' none of the victims did anything to encourage you and you imposed your will on them			0
they are completely innocent victims			0
' he told the boy he expects him to work with probation ' to deal with the background of this offending and ensure your relationships with women in the future are healthy and responsible			2
' @entity167 , defending , said the offences happened at a troubled time and when he was aged 12 to 14			2
