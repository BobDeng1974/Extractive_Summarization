by @entity0 last updated at 5:13 pm on 19th december 2011 it does n't take a food expert to say that @entity4 and @entity5 foods taste different			1
but it does take an expert to explain why			0
the idea of ' food pairing ' is n't new - chemically analysing foods to see which flavour compounds they share has led restaurants to pair unlikely foods such as white chocolate and caviar			0
but new research - analysing 381 ingredients , 1021 flavour compounds and 56,498 recipes - has found that east @entity5 food takes an entirely different approach			1
it actually avoids foods that match			0
pork chops with apple wedges and raisins : thirteen ingredients - including pork - appear in 74.4 per cent of western cooking beef and vegetable stir fry : while east @entity5 cuisine does have ' defining ' flavours such as garlic and soy sauce , its approach to pairing foods is different ' @entity38 ' has led to some of the most exciting cooking of the past few years			1
but it seems that ' pairing ' foods is n't a hard and fast rule - and @entity4 and @entity5 foods ' pair ' flavours in completely different ways			2
' @entity4 cuisines tend to use ' pairs ' that share many flavours , ' say the researchers in a paper published in @entity54			0
' but east @entity5 cuisines tend to avoid ingredients that share them			0
this investigation opens new avenues towards understanding culinary practices			0
' the thickness of the ' cords ' connecting the flavours here shows how many flavours they share - @entity4 cuisine is more likely to pair foods that share lots of flavours , whereas east @entity5 cuisine avoids obvious ' pairs ' this crucial difference in approach explains why food from different sides of the globe tastes so radically different			1
researchers including @entity79 from the @entity80 analysed 381 ingredients used around the world , and 1021 flavour compounds found in those ingredients - networking them to show how many ' flavours ' each ingredient shared			1
they then compared the information with 56,498 recipes from @entity89 and @entity90 , plus a @entity92 recipe site @entity93 to see which of five cultures - @entity95 , western @entity96 , southern @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity5 - paired flavour compounds that ' matched ' each other most frequently			2
two recipes analysed : @entity102 ' western ' pairings - such as tomato and parmesan cheese - tend to ' pair ' foods that have a lot of matching flavour compounds			2
@entity108 matches - such as garlic and sesame oil , do n't share as many flavour compounds the results were surprising			0
@entity95 and western @entity96 recipes tend to pair flavours that ' match '			0
both southern @entity96 and east @entity5 recipes tend to avoid recipes where the ingredients share flavours.the contrast with east @entity5 recipes was particularly marked , the researchers found			1
the more flavours two ingredients share , the less likely they are to be used together in east @entity5 cuisine - whereas 13 key ingredients , including butter , milk and egg , appear in 74.4 per cent of dishes in @entity95			2
there are flavours that ' define ' a cuisine - for instance basil in south @entity96 food , or soy sauce in east @entity5 - but the classic pairings of each cuisine , such as parmesan cheese and tomato ( which share lots of flavours ) , and garlic and sesame oil ( which share very few ) show that ' food pairing ' is a distinctly western idea			2
the ' flavour pairs ' that define western and east @entity5 food take a totally different approach - while @entity4 food is built on similar pairs such as butter and milk , @entity5 food seeks ' clashing ' pairings such as sesame oil and garlic the idea that the difference in approach is so different is all new			1
it also turns the whole idea of ' food pairing ' cuisine on its head			0
if east @entity5 food tastes good by avoiding food pairs - rather than simply identifying , then pairing them - then perhaps this research paves the way for new avenues of experimental cooking .			1

researchers analysed 381 ingredients , 1021 ' tastes ' and 56,498 recipes
western food seeks out ' food pairs ' with matching taste chemicals
@entity5 foods take opposite approach and avoid ' pairing ' ingredients that share flavours
' could lead to new avenues of understanding food ' - researchers
