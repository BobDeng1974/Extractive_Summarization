the worried mother then had her worst fears realised , discovering her only child ’s lifeless body			2
she told mr @entity90 : ‘ she ’s cold			0
’ the little girl still had the cord around her neck			0

@entity204 , defending , said his client did not consider himself worthy of sympathy			0
he said the killing had resulted from @entity20 ’s ‘ abnormal thinking ’ , adding : ‘ within the warped reasoning going on on that day , this was seen as an act of mercy			1
’ sentencing : @entity11 @entity10 ( pictured ) was told @entity20 did not consider himself worthy of sympathy the defendant ’s situation would only become worse as he received treatment for his condition , he said			1

’ judge @entity228 told @entity20 : ‘ this was a deliberate and considered act by you which involved the taking of a life of another human being			1
‘ @entity14 was your own daughter			1
she was entitled to expect that you would protect and care for her and not take her life while she was asleep			0
' @entity14 had her whole life ahead of her and her chance for a future has been taken away by someone who was supposed to keep her safe ' detective inspector @entity243 , @entity244 ‘ she was tucked up in bed in a place regarded by her as her home , in her mind a very safe place indeed			1
a breach of trust could not have been more gross			0

@entity244 ’s detective inspector @entity243 , who led the investigation , said : ‘ @entity9 has been professionally identified as a man who had psychiatric issues at the time			0
