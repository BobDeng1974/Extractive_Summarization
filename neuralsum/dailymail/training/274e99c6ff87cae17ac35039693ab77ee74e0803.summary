by @entity0 it 's a remote - controlled machine which drives like a normal truck - but takes off and lands like a helicopter			1
now the @entity4 , a ' multicopter ' designed for the @entity6 military , has been seen in action for the first time			1
@entity9 , the company behind the machine , has released a video showing the unmanned transformer flying through the desert			1
scroll down to video the @entity4 , which is capable of both flying and driving , has been show in action for the first time @entity9 , which were commissioned by the @entity18 to design the machine , released the video showing the transformer on its first flight the ' multicopter ' is seen driving through the desert before the rotors are sprung out for take off the machine is designed to fly up to 150mph in the air and can be flown using a remote control in the clip , the eight rotor blades are sprung out for take off , allowing the machine to cruise at up to 150mph in the air			1
the blades then fold back in while the truck is used for off - road driving			1
the transformer was built as part of a @entity6 military desire for a ' multi-mission medical and casualty evacuation unmanned air vehicle / unmanned ground vehicle ' , according to @entity42			1
essentially it meets the need of an automobile that can adapt to a variety of situations			0
an @entity6 government study on medical evacuation concluded that the use of robots in military missions would allow for casualty evacuations in areas and times that manned platforms should not operate in , such as ' zero - zero ' weather and contaminated environments			1
once the @entity4 reaches its target , its also possible for the controls to be switched and for it to be driven by a human			0
overall , it reduces the risks involved with many missions			0
@entity65 is also designed for cargo delivery			0
the video shows the view from inside the remote - controlled vehicle it also shows how the machine is driven like a normal off - road vehicle the transformer was tested by the company in february and the video clip showing it in action has now been released the transformer was built to create ' a multi-mission medical and casualty evacuation unmanned air vehicle / unmanned ground vehicle ' @entity9 , based in @entity80 , tested the remotely - operated , transforming , flying , driving evacuation vehicle earlier thsi year			1
' the @entity83 is interested in using the @entity4 vehicle for unmanned cargo resupply missions , ' @entity9 chief engineer @entity82 tells @entity42			0
' they 've done work on this in the past with other platforms , such as the @entity91 - @entity92 , but our platform will be much less expensive			2
' the driving components were tested in late 2013 , while the flying aspects were tested in february			1
the video has only just been released			1
the @entity6 military commissioned the creation of a vehicle that can drive and fly remotely so it can be sent on missions unmanned ' @entity102 ' takes flight on a test run it utilizes the vertical take off and landing of a helicopter and couples it with the off road driving capabilities of a truck this artist 's impression by the developer @entity9 showed what they intended the @entity119 to look like the @entity4 would allow the military to enter and exit dangerous areas without having to send in soldiers in november , it was reported that @entity6 soldiers in combat had made a request for drones that could be launched by hand			1
it prompted the @entity128 to commission three dozen micro-drones that resemble birds			0
@entity131 of @entity132 announced at the time the @entity18 @entity133 , or @entity133 , awarded them $ 4.5 million in federal contracts to deliver to the @entity128 36 models of the company ’s @entity137 unmanned aerial vehicle by december			2
the @entity139 - reportedly the world 's largest ' multicopter ' - has been designed for autonomous casualty evacuation and manned or unmanned cargo resupply missions @entity143 tested the transformer 's flight earlier this year each @entity137 can soar through the sky at speeds up to 55 knots and has the ability to offer soldiers an array of advantageous features			1
each aircraft weighs roughly two - and - a - half pounds , and according to the @entity154 , the @entity137 's flexible wings help enable the @entity156 to blend into its surroundings			2
then in december , the army successfully tested a futuristic laser weapon capable of shooting football - sized mortar rounds			2
in november , the @entity128 ordered 36 drones known as ' @entity163 ' that could be hand launched and were fitted with cameras for reconnaissance missions during tests , a ' quarter - sized ' invisible laser beam successfully targeted and destroyed more than 90 incoming mortar rounds and six to seven unmanned drones			2
the truck - mounted weapon , known as the @entity172 ( @entity173 ) , gives a hint at what a weapon of the future could look like			2
using an invisible laser beam to exact targets , the rounds are capable of taking down drones from the sky and even missiles			0
in november , the @entity128 ordered 36 drones known as ' @entity163 ' that could be hand launched and were fitted with cameras for reconnaissance missions @entity186 , the project manager for the laser program , told @entity188 the test results were ' above and beyond ' what they had expected going into the testing			0
' we had no thoughts that this 10 - kilowatt would be as successful in doing that as it has been , ' he said			0
mortars are common battlefield weapons that are hard to protect against because they can be fired from short distances			0
the mortars used in the test were standard 60 millimeter rounds – the length of a football — fired from a distance of less than two kilometers in salvos of two to three mortar rounds each			0
the laser ’s success rate against incoming mortar shells indicates that battlefield protection from the small explosive rounds could be possible in a few years .			0
