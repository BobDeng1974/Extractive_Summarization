the row began after @entity7 and husband @entity16 ( right ) built an extension on their house in @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 , but an inspector ruled the neighbour 's drainpipe passed too close to it @entity7 used her job at @entity9 to conduct an illegal investigation into @entity12 ( pictured ) after hearing he had a second job as a taxi driver and convincing herself that he was not declaring the income the @entity39 asked mr @entity12 and ms @entity13 to remove the pipe , and eventually sent them a lawyer 's letter falsely claiming they had permission to move it themselves			1
when mr @entity12 and ms @entity13 went away on holiday for a weekend they returned to find that the @entity39 had paid a building firm to relocate the pipe			1
soon afterwards mr @entity12 said he became concerned that @entity7 seemed to know a lot about his tax affairs , and informed the authorities			1
@entity52 heard that she began looking into his finances after hearing that he drove a taxi in addition to claiming benefits , and was trying to prove he had n't declared the extra income			0
she said she wanted to investigate personally because the arrival of the @entity59 had changed the culture at the tax office and they were not handing out money as freely as before			2
she added : ' i accessed the computer files			0
i was looking to see whether mr @entity12 had declared a second job			1
' you would have to declare any change in circumstances to the tax credits office , to @entity9			1
my question was whether he had a second job he was not declaring			2

i reported he had a second job			2
' if i think someone is committing tax fraud and i report them i do n’t think i ’m committing a crime			2
he made so many false complaints that people said why do n’t you do something			0
' i even had people saying they would sort him out for me			0
i know what i did was wrong			0
' @entity7 kept the details of what she was doing a secret from her bosses at @entity9 , and when police initially questioned her she denied the offences			1
but she later changed her plea , saying : ' i attempted to get out of it in a blind panic			0
' i could n’t say to them the real reason i did , so i probably just made up a whole load of nonsense			0
' i did n’t access it for tittle tattle or gossip			0
i accessed it because someone told me he was committing fraud			0
i did n’t do it for a wee nosey			0
i discussed it with no - one			0

outside court , dayshift manager mr @entity12 , 48 , said : ' for years and years i had said to @entity13 that i was suspicious that she had been looking at our tax records			1
' we got a folder full of letters from the @entity136 , about weeds , cutting a hedge			0
i always suspected she checked our records to see if we could afford to defend a civil case			0
' after they took the pipe down she drove past and made a rude gesture			2
we had had hell from her and i decided that was the day i was going to call @entity9			2
' basically , they were neighbours from hell			0
we never went on holiday for five years because of them			0
we have moved away now			0
' the thing is , we never even put the downpipe up - it was there when we bought the property			2
