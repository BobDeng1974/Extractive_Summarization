no offence is intended to the loyal assistant stepping into the breach			2
but you get the impression that , without @entity6 in the opposing technical area on saturday , something will be missing for @entity9 boss @entity8			1
there was more than just professional respect between two former @entity13 warriors who , despite some of the absolute lunacy that goes on around the fringes of both clubs , found plenty of time to be the friendliest of foes during their playing days at the big two			1
so , as warmly as he ’ll welcome caretaker boss @entity26 , there ’s a feeling that the former @entity29 defender will be sparing at least a thought or two for the man who finally decided to walk away from a much - changed , majorly - diminished , barely - recognisable @entity32			1
during his days at @entity29 @entity8 formed a respectful rivalry with former @entity32 player @entity6 @entity6 has been placed on gardening leave following his decision to step down as manager of @entity32 @entity26 ( right ) replaced @entity6 in the @entity32 hotseat after he left the @entity40 club ‘ i had the utmost respect for @entity48 as a player - and we were known to socialise once or twice in @entity51 , ’ said @entity8 with a grin and , unless there was something wrong with the lighting , a very definite reddening of the cheeks			1
‘ the rivalry between @entity32 and @entity29 was so intense , of course , but we got on great			1
there were are a group of players who , if we saw each other in town , would stop and have a couple of drinks before going our separate ways			2
‘ when we played against each other , there was still that respect , but we wanted to ... actually i ca n’t say what we wanted to do to each other ! we wanted to win , that ’s all i will say			2
‘ playing against him , he was a good player , a real pain			2
we used to have words and a bit of banter , naturally , but there was always respect			2
his record speaks for itself			0
he was a fantastic goal scorer and , no matter what anyone says , he did what he had to do as a manager by getting @entity32 promoted twice			1
@entity26 will take charge of the @entity32 first team as they head into the top three clash with @entity9 caretaker manager @entity26 ( right ) will be assisted by coach @entity83 ( left ) and @entity84 ‘ it ’s not ideal how it panned out and i really feel for @entity48			1
i wish him all the best and hope he ’s back in football soon			0
i will look to make contact with him soon and speak to him , that ’s just the decent thing to do			0
’ any manager in the land watching @entity6 in the months and years since @entity32 plunged into insolvency must have felt a range of emotions			1
sympathy , naturally , for a fellow pro who had to act as leader , spokesman , figurehead * and * overall boss of an entire football department while a variety of men in suits made bold promises about what they ’d do next			0
virtually every other head coach in @entity107 would also confess , though , to feeling more than a bit of envy as they watched @entity32 continue to spend as if tomorrow was just a rumour			1
even this ‘ slimmed - down ’ organisation is losing around £ 1million a month , yet still they allowed the manager to make signings			2
addressing the two sides of the rebuilding job that fell upon @entity6 from a great height , @entity8 said : ‘ the one thing i would say is : @entity48 knew exactly what he was going into			1
‘ people will look at us managers and say we are stupid , we ’re thick			0
they are probably right - but it ’s the buzz you get from the job			0
when things are going well , it ’s fantastic , when things are not going well you need to find a way to turn things around quickly			0
@entity32 chief @entity131 has opened up the possibility of @entity26 taking a permanent role in charge ‘ when you are at a really top club , where the demands are so high and the pressure is always on , if you do n’t deliver you run the risk of this happening			1
it ’s the same at any club			0
it is a results business and unfortunately @entity48 has paid the price , rightly or wrongly			0
‘ @entity32 obviously have resources , because they have the biggest budget , but it ’s about how you spend it			1
i have a budget here and i need to get the best out of it			0
the biggest budget will not always win you the league and , at the moment , the league bears that out with @entity156 having such a big lead			0
’ asked if he thought a club continuing to spend when they ’re heading for another financial meltdown was akin to cheating , a laughing @entity8 said : ‘ no comment ! listen , they started the season with a budget			2
whether it ’s fair or not , they have the players			0
the club is losing money , but it ’s not my problem or @entity9 ’ problem			0

@entity8 sent his regards to former @entity32 manager @entity6
@entity6 stepped down from his role after more than three years in charge
