by @entity0 published : 02:45 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 20:08 est , 7 july 2013 she 's famous for being incredibly nice to everyone she meets and now singer @entity3 has gone one step further by revealing that she would give up her career to end animal testing			1
although the @entity9 has outlawed testing beauty products on animals , the rest of the world is yet to follow suit - much to animal lover @entity13 ' dismay			1
asked to choose between a global ban on vivisection and her singing career by an interviewer , @entity13 said that she would plump for the former , adding : ' i could still do my music in any capacity if i wanted to , but i think it ’s just so important for humans to show compassion			1
animal lover : vegetarian singer @entity3 says she would give up her music career for a ban on vivisection ' they say you can judge a society on how it treats its animals , and i think that ’s very true – it all filters down			2
' she added : ' the @entity9 ban will put pressure on the rest of the world : they wo n’t be able to sell their animal - tested products in @entity42 any longer , so it makes financial sense that they replace their animal tests with alternative methods if they want to trade in this lucrative market			1
' this is n't the first time @entity13 has made clear her feelings on the issue of animal cruelty			1
in 2008 , the singer reportedly turned down a seven - figure offer to appear at a @entity57 sale launch from former boss @entity58 on the grounds that the retailer stocks fur			2
she also supports several animal rights charities and has attempted to raise the profile of animal rights by collaborating with @entity64 on an ethical accessories line and @entity66 - which has long campaigned against vivisection - on a beauty range			1
along with a cruelty free make - up collection , vegetarian @entity13 also fronts the beauty retailer 's @entity70 perfume collection			1
although real musk , which is taken from the @entity74 , is banned under the @entity76 act on endangered species , synthetic musk , as used in @entity66 's product , does no harm to animals - or the people who use it			1
cruelty free : @entity13 poses with a bottle of her @entity70 perfume created for @entity66 interview : @entity13 made her comments in the august issue of @entity92 which is out now that the chemical , which predates @entity66 , was declared safe for use after extensive testing - some of which could have been done on animals - cuts no ice with @entity13 , who points out that vivisection is far less effective than modern tests			1
' i tell [ cynical people ] there are so many tests that are so superior to animal testing that the practice is actually laughable and needless , ' she revealed in an interview with @entity92			1
' i ’m really hopeful but people need to know there ’s still a long way to go - i do n’t want them to get complacent and not sign the @entity114 pledge			0
' i ’m not about bashing people over the head and telling them what they should do , but i have a point to make and i will make it subtly , showing people they can choose to do the right thing			0
' @entity13 also revealed that she refuses to use any product that could have something of animal origin and insists that her make - up artist and hair stylist do n't use products that have been tested on living creatures			1
' i definitely am quite strict about it			0
my makeup and hair people know i do n’t use any brushes that use real animal hair , and we stay away from products from parts of the world where they ’re animal - tested and not humane at all			0
and i ’ve found there are websites with good information on what products are cruelty - free			2
' compassion : @entity13 supports several animal charities and is the patron of @entity147 pet : when she 's not singing , @entity13 loves nothing more than spending time with her beloved pet dog , @entity153 ' i really love @entity157 haircare , @entity154 and @entity155 , ' she added			2
' also @entity66 ’s dry oils , which i put on in the shower , and its @entity160 and @entity161 are the best things ever			2
' i ’m quite obsessed with coconut – i put it on my skin and on my hair			0
i learnt that from my grandma			0
i even put it on my horse			0
that sounds pretty weird , but i put it in his hair and he really loves it ! ' but it has n't all been smooth sailing for @entity13 thanks to confusing labels and baffling chemical names , which meant that she had to give up some products after discovering they contain cochineal ( made from beetle blood ) and fish scales			2
' i ’ve only just learnt that a lot of the red pigment in cosmetics is actually from beetles , and i think some of the shimmers in bronzers can be made from fish scales			0
' so i like body shop products ; i do n’t have to worry about such ingredients in its red lipsticks and shimmer palettes			0
i could n’t even kill a spider or a fly or anything			0
i ’m very @entity201 in that sense			0

the magazine is also available in digital format on the @entity208			0
