by @entity0 published : 12:20 est , 13 december 2012 updated : 15:37 est , 13 december 2012 these eerie ' ghost train ' images are part of a project to bring back to life one of @entity7 's long lost railways			1
when it operated , the @entity8 and @entity9 ( @entity10 ) was disparagingly referred to as the muddle and go nowhere line - but after it was axed it earned the nicknamed missed and greatly needed			2
photographer @entity13 , who lives in @entity14 near its former route , has attempted to bring it back to life with these incredible images of a time gone by merged with the present day			1
how it used to be : artist @entity13 's @entity23 series combines the golden age of @entity7 railway with modern images times change : here mr @entity13 captures the site of the former @entity30 station in @entity31 the line served a mostly rural region across from @entity34 across the middle of the @entity7 to @entity31 from 1893 to 1959			2
for the @entity38 series photographer , mr @entity36 has skilfully woven pictures from its bygone days together with how the route looks now			0
he said : ' the feeling i â€™m trying to convey with these images is that in the space of about 100 years the railways came along changed the world in an instant			0
' they opened up entire countries to relatively fast and easy transportation overnight and they sparked the modern way of life that we now take for granted			0
' they then disappeared just as quickly			0
' disused line : this former busy route is now abandoned but the image shows what was at the the old @entity60 scenes from the past : rail lines through the eastern county of @entity31 including ( pictured ) @entity65 scenes from 1983 to 1959 : pictured is the site of the former @entity70 and @entity71 station quite a turnaround : pictured here is the former @entity10 turntable which was demolished in the 1970s overgrown : may of the sites along the old railway are now popular with dog walkers rural stations : many disused stations such as at @entity80 ( pictured ) connected villages to wider conurbations lives along the route : mr @entity13 's pictures combine people past and present water under the bridge : this image captures the scene near the former @entity91 ' nature got straight back to work reclaiming the remains '			1
