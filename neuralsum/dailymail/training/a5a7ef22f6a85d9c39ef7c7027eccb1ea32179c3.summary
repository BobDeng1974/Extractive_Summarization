police were accused last night of behaving like ‘ thugs with weapons ’ after firing a 50,000 - volt @entity3 into the back of a blind man			1
an officer mistook stroke victim @entity8 ’s white stick for a samurai sword and discharged the stun gun – leaving the retired architect writhing in agony on the ground			1
no disciplinary action is being taken against the officer			2
the extraordinary blunder is the latest illustration of the soaring number of controversial incidents with the weapons , which can be fatal			2
' terrified ' : blind pensioner @entity8 , 61 , was set upon in @entity21 , @entity22 after a police officer mistook his cane for a samurai sword mr @entity8 , 61 , said yesterday he ‘ thought he was being killed ’ by the stun gun before being handcuffed as he lay face down on the ground			1
he added that the officer who discharged the device should be ‘ sacked , charged and locked up ’			1
former home secretary @entity32 , who is himself blind , said last night : ‘ i am as stunned as @entity8 must have been by the taser itself			1
after the @entity35 i genuinely hoped we ’d made some progress			0
’ ' trapped in a nightmare ' : mr @entity8 said he feared he would suffer another stroke when he was hit with the taser in @entity21 , @entity22 ( file photo ) @entity41 , of the @entity43 charity , said : ‘ i know @entity8 personally and he would n’t hurt a fly			1
how could you mistake a white walking stick for a samurai sword ? i am shocked and disappointed at the police			0
’ last year in the @entity50 , tasers were fired by police into suspects at least 1,081 times , compared with 744 in 2010 – a 45 per cent rise			0
in june the @entity54 , which represents rank - and - file officers , wrote to the prime minister to demand that every front - line officer have access to a @entity3			2
there are currently 12,000 tasers on our streets but under the @entity54 plans that number would be increased to 36,000			0
mr @entity8 ’s ordeal began at 5.45pm last friday when he was walking down an alleyway to meet friends at a pub in @entity21 , @entity22			1
officers had received reports of a man roaming around a town centre armed with a large sword			0
minutes later , they swooped on mr @entity8 , wrongly assuming he was the swordsman			1
the unnamed officer claimed he shouted for mr @entity75 to stop but when he carried on walking , opened fire only to realise his mistake			1
innocent : blind mr @entity8 was walking along @entity80 to meet his friends in a pub when the officer swooped the real thing : a samurai sword of the type that mr @entity8 's stick was mistaken for by a police officer mr @entity8 , who is now pursuing legal action against @entity90 , was taken to hospital before being released			1
police later arrested a 27 - year old man believed to be the real offender but he was released without charge after no weapon was found			2
mr @entity8 , who has five sons and two grandchildren , said : ‘ i was slowly making my way down the street when i heard this man shouting			1
i had no idea it was directed at me and i just kept thinking , “ i ’ve got to get out of here ” because i thought they were hooligans trying to mug me			0
worried : mr @entity8 , a retired company director , thought he was being attacked by hooligans when he was hit with the weapon by the officer ‘ but suddenly i felt a huge force on my back and this electric shock went right through my body			1
i thought i was being killed			0
my muscles just went and i dropped my walking stick and collapsed on to the floor			0
i thought i was having another stroke			2
‘ it was like being hit by lightning			0
i dropped to the floor with my cane and i was shouting all the time , “ i ’m blind ! i ’m blind ! ” after mr @entity8 fell to the floor face down , the police officer knelt on his back before handcuffing him			1
mr @entity8 said : ‘ i told him he was hurting me but he was n’t listening			1
he used such force when he put the handcuffs on that he broke a small bracelet which was a family heirloom belonging to my grandfather			0
‘ he was not an officer of the law ; he was an absolute thug with a licence to carry a dangerous weapon			0
’ mr @entity8 was left blind following a stroke in 2008 which left him partially paralysed down one side			1
he suffered a second stroke following a brain haemorrhage in march this year			0
he said a second officer admitted there had been a case of mistaken identity and apologised			0
but he added : ‘ it was obvious that i was blind and did not pose a threat to anyone			0
i walk at a snail ’s pace and they could have asked me to stop but this officer was on a mission to use that gun no matter what			2
’ a police officer holding a taser stun gun during a training exercise ( file photo ) chief superintendent @entity155 , of @entity90 , said the incident had been referred to the @entity157 and the officer who fired the @entity3 had not been suspended			1
tasers were introduced to give officers an option between firearms and other weapons such as batons and @entity165 gas they have been discharged in more than 6,200 confrontations across @entity168 and @entity169 since they were introduced in 2004 police use a @entity172 manufactured £ 500 x26 model which fires a 50,000 - volt charge into the victim via two barbs attached to thin metal wires it has a range of 21ft and causes muscles to twitch uncontrollably he added : ‘ we deeply regret what has happened			2
we have clearly put this man through a traumatic experience and we are extremely sorry			0
‘ we have launched an urgent investigation to understand what lessons can be learned			1
’ the use of @entity3 by the @entity22 force has risen by 80 per cent in a year			2
last year they were fired 73 times			0
in the past , critics including @entity193 have said tasers , which were introduced in the @entity50 in 2004 , should be used only by highly trained officers where there is a threat to life or of serious injury			0
tasers , which are described as a ‘ less - lethal ’ alternative to firearms , cause temporary paralysis by firing a 50,000 - volt charge into the victim via two barbs attached to thin metal wires which have a 21ft range			2
solicitor @entity209 , who has represented several people injured by stun guns , said : ‘ this officer was obviously trigger - happy as he shot a blind man in the back			1
this highlights once again that we have too many officers who are not properly trained to use these weapons and are harming innocent individuals with them			0
something needs to change urgently .			0

retired company director @entity8 , 61 , was shot as he walked to meet friends in @entity21 , @entity22
the unnamed officer then handcuffed mr @entity8 - a two - time stroke victim - as he fell to the ground after being hit with the stun - gun
the frightened grandfather , who is blind and partially paralysed down one side of his body , feared he was being attacked by a mugger
mr @entity8 has called for the officer *responsible* to be ' sacked , charged and locked - up ' following the incident
@entity90 has said it ' deeply regrets ' the blunder , and has launched an urgent investigation
