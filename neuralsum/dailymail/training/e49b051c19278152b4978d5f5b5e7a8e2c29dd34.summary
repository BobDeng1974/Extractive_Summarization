today 's international friendlies may often be humdrum affairs , with nothing resting on them other than club fans and managers desperate for their star players to avoid injury			0
yet at @entity11 , 80 years ago on friday , an encounter between @entity9 and @entity10 not only decided who could call themselves world champions but was so violent that it stretched the meaning of the word ‘ friendly ’ beyond its limit			1
by the end , at least three players had suffered broken bones and moral outrage screamed off the pages of the @entity26 press			0
the @entity27 even questioned whether international friendlies should be played at all			0
@entity29 scored the first goal in the @entity31 as @entity9 raced into a 3 - 0 lead @entity33 was @entity34 prime minister how did one match come to spark such fierce debate ? in 1934 , @entity9 were not members of @entity38 and had n’t taken part in the first two @entity41 tournaments			1
@entity10 had won the second of those , five months earlier in @entity44 , much to the delight of @entity33 , who saw the triumph as a vindication of his fascist ideology			1
to @entity51 minds , though , @entity10 ’s victory did not make them the world ’s leading team			1
after all , @entity9 had yet to be defeated on home soil ( that would not happen until 1949 , when @entity56 triumphed 2 - 0 at @entity57 )			1
and , as this was the @entity34 ’ first match since defeating @entity61 to win the @entity63 trophy , the stage was set for a mouth - watering encounter billed as the ‘ real world cup final ’			1
@entity10 , coached by the meticulous @entity67 , knew the stakes were high , with one of their journalists prophetically describing @entity11 as a ‘ theatre of international war ’			1
it would later be claimed that their players had been offered huge inducements to defeat @entity9			1
win bonuses of £ 150 a man , an @entity79 each and exemption from military service were some of the carrots dangled before the @entity34 players as @entity33 eyed a victory of sporting and political significance			0
@entity9 ’s team did not feature a single player with more than 10 caps			1
the starting line - up was dominated by @entity92 , the undisputed leading @entity51 team of the day			2
seven @entity93 ( @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 ) started for @entity9 — a record that still stands			1
@entity96 , who had belted a clearance into the lap of a visibly irate @entity33 during a friendly against @entity10 in @entity44 18 months earlier , was captain			1
completing the xi were a young @entity106 , winning his second cap , @entity109 ’s @entity108 , @entity111 ’s @entity110 and @entity29 of @entity112			0
a crowd of 56,044 crammed into @entity11			0
@entity33 was in @entity114 and demanded regular updates from @entity116			0
@entity10 ’s start was catastrophic			1
@entity9 raced into a 3 - 0 lead after 12 minutes , thanks to two goals from @entity121 — who had missed a penalty in the opening minute — and one from @entity99			1
worse still for @entity10 , their midfield general @entity126 suffered a broken foot in the second minute in a challenge by @entity99			1
he stayed on until the 15th minute after which the @entity34 played with 10 men , as substitutes were not allowed at the time			1
@entity96 has his wounds tended after the game , which @entity33 was desperate to win @entity92 trainer @entity135 gives treatment to @entity97 in the @entity11 treatment room how the @entity27 reported the match 80 years ago the loss of @entity126 lit the fuse , with the visitors believing @entity99 had deliberately injured the defender			2
incensed , the @entity34 sought retribution and the challenges flew in — but later , @entity10 coach @entity67 admitted that @entity126 , in trying to turn quickly , had stubbed the toe of his boot in the ground			1
‘ the @entity34 had gone berserk and were kicking everybody and everything in sight , ’ noted @entity96 in his autobiography			0
the numbers were temporarily evened up when @entity96 suffered a broken nose following an elbow to the face			0
when he returned to the field , after a few quick stitches , an @entity9 victory seemed a certainty			2
but the @entity34 mounted a comeback , albeit accompanied by violence			0
shoulder - charging and two - footed challenges from both sides were rife but two classy goals from @entity166 in four second - half minutes punctuated the chaos			2
@entity9 were suddenly clinging on and injuries were mounting			2
@entity29 had a broken arm , suffered in the first half , and @entity99 was nursing a swollen jaw , having been struck in the face			0
@entity98 had an injured ankle			0
one @entity9 player was able to rise above the carnage : @entity97			2
known as ‘ @entity176 ’ , @entity97 was a former miner whose match - day motto was ‘ first man into a tackle never gets hurt ’			2
the @entity180 formed a crucial part of the rearguard action , hurling himself into challenges in midfield			0
@entity9 captain @entity96 introduces his team - mates to prince @entity187 and the @entity34 ambassador @entity188 before the game at @entity11 the @entity190 meets the @entity34 players ‘ @entity97 enjoyed himself that afternoon , ’ joked @entity96 later			1
‘ for the first time in their lives the @entity34 were given a sample of real , honest shoulder - charging			2
’ yet even a man down , the @entity34 were subjecting @entity9 to a relentless onslaught			2
@entity166 , on a hat - trick , struck the bar and was also denied by @entity94			2
then , at the death , the @entity34 fashioned a great opening but a team - mate chose not to square the ball to @entity166 , who was unmarked			0
the @entity205 legend , a winner of three @entity34 titles and two @entity207 , would later cite the missed opportunity as the greatest regret of his life			0
@entity10 ’s chance had gone and @entity9 had their famous 3 - 2 victory			1
incredibly , despite the violence , the teams went ahead with a banquet in the evening , attended by both sets of players with the walking wounded observing the pleasantries			0
@entity96 , sporting his broken nose and feeling groggy , recalled locking eyes with his assailant , who smiled back at him before letting out a raucous laugh			0
‘ i ’m glad i am a pretty even - tempered fellow or i would have gone across the table at him , ’ said the @entity92 man			0
‘ but he was n’t worth it			0
’ the @entity27 match report the next day , by @entity230 , was headlined ‘ @entity9 beat @entity10 — but should these games be played ? ’ far from wanting to hail a famous victory , he wrote : ‘ from the point of view of football as i understand it , i hope to forget it			1
’ @entity230 , like many of his @entity239 counterparts , claimed the differences between the styles of @entity26 and @entity243 teams meant international friendlies should be put on hold ‘ until there is a better understanding of the methods which may and may not be employed			0
’ as for the @entity34 ’ tackling , @entity230 lamented : ‘ they are not greatly concerned with the ball			0
’ in @entity10 , the defeat was claimed as a moral victory and their players were hailed as ‘ @entity255 of @entity11			2
’ @entity10 would have to wait until 1973 for their first win over @entity9 .			1

@entity9 beat @entity10 3 - 2 in ' @entity31 ' in 1934
showdown was billed as the ' real world cup final '
home side raced into a 3 - 0 lead and @entity10 were down to 10 men
visitors fought back but were still beaten
