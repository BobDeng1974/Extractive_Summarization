by @entity0 published : 00:44 est , 12 october 2012 updated : 09:56 est , 12 october 2012 @entity1 is under pressure after insisting that the @entity4 consulate in @entity5 did not ask for additional security before it was attacked on september 11 - despite what diplomats and @entity9 officials have said			1
@entity11 spent much of last night 's vice-presidential debate hitting out at the administration 's handling of the @entity16 assault which killed ambassador @entity17 and four other @entity4			1
the vice president defended the government 's handling of the crisis and denied that the @entity9 had turned down a request for security reinforcements in the months before the raid			2
the lively debate exchange came just hours after presidential candidate @entity26 launched his own denunciation of @entity29 's response to the attack , saying the administration ' failed to grasp the seriousness of the challenges that we face '			1
also , the head of a special operations team helping out with security asked for ' more , not less ' reinforcements before the government pulled dozens from @entity16 earlier this year			2
but @entity1 , when asked about it by debate moderator @entity56 , said : ' we were n't told they wanted more security there			1
' @entity11 kept up his attack , saying : ' there were requests for extra security - those requests were not honoured			2
' he compared the situation in @entity16 with the heavily guarded @entity4 embassy in @entity68 as he insisted : ' our ambassador in @entity71 has a @entity73 detachment guarding him , should n't we have a @entity73 detachment guarding our ambassador in @entity5 ? ' clash : the pair disagreed over many aspects of how the administration handled the crisis the vice president attempted to deflect the blame for the security failures onto @entity37 in @entity84 , saying that @entity11 's fiscal plan ' cut embassy security in his budget by $ 300million below what we asked for			1
' the pair also sparred over another controversial issue connected to the @entity5 assault , as @entity1 again insisted that the administration initially believed the deadly raid was the result of protests over an anti-muslim @entity98 video which were sweeping the @entity101 world at the time			1
' the intelligence community told us that , ' he said			0
' as they learned more facts about exactly what happened , they changed their assessment			0
' but @entity11 replied : ' it took the president two weeks to acknowledge this was a terrorist attack			0
he went to the @entity113 and in his speech at the @entity113 six times talked about the @entity98 video			1
' look , if we are hit by terrorists , we are going to call it for what it is : a terrorist attack			0
' criticism : @entity26 also launched an attack on the president 's handling of the deadly raid former presidential candidate @entity127 predicted on friday that @entity1 's uncompromising statements would ' haunt ' the @entity29 campaign ahead of next month 's election			1
' @entity1 on @entity5 was so wrong last night , it â€™s going to haunt them from now until the next debate , ' the former @entity132 speaker told @entity136			2
@entity26 also launched a blistering assault on the @entity29 administration 's treatment of the crisis as he spoke at a campaign rally in @entity142			1
after an @entity29 official suggested that the tragedy had been politicised by @entity37 , the @entity37 candidate responded : ' i think today we got another indication of how president @entity29 and his campaign fail to grasp the seriousness of the challenges that we face here in @entity4			1
' he continued : ' mr president , this is an issue because we were attacked successfully by terrorists on the anniversary of 9/11			0
' president @entity29 , this is an issue because @entity4 wonder why it was it took so long for you and your administration to admit that this was a terrorist attack			1
' rage : a protester holding his rifle during the assault on the @entity4 @entity168 in @entity5 on september 11th hours before the debate , two top security officials who had been to the consulate testified on @entity172 that they had made requests for more troops			1
former regional security forces officer @entity175 and lt col @entity176 , who was head of a @entity178 ' @entity177 ' in the country , placed blame on deputy assistant secretary of state @entity181 for rejecting their requests			0
' the takeaway ... for me and my staff , was abundantly clear - we were not going to get resources until the aftermath of an incident , ' @entity175 said			0
' and the question that we would ask is : how thin does the ice have to get before someone falls through ? ' ' we were fighting a losing battle , ' @entity176 added			0
' we could n't even keep what we had			0
' @entity196 and @entity197 , the undersecretary for management , testified that they believed the security measures in place were enough			0
attack : four @entity4 citizens died in the raid on the consulate in @entity5 , including mr @entity17 on september 11 , the day he died , @entity17 wrote to @entity207 officials detailing a dispute involving the leaders of two prominent @entity5 militias who were responsible for security in the city , according to the @entity214			1
the two men , @entity216 and @entity217 , claimed that the @entity4 was lobbying for centrist politician @entity218 to become @entity16 's prime minister			0
they said that if he won the vote , they ' would not continue to guarantee security in @entity5 , a critical function they asserted they were currently providing , ' according to @entity17			2
despite that warning , @entity17 did not ask for more @entity4 troops , and commented that @entity5 officials believed the city was becoming safer			1
the cable made no mention of a @entity4 - made @entity98 video mocking the @entity233 which was originally thought to have been the motivation for the deadly assault on the consulate later that night			1
pleas : lt. col. @entity176 said he asked for reinforcements in @entity16 but faced troop withdrawals instead the @entity4 compound was being guarded by members of the ' february 17 @entity243 ' , a militia which shared members with the groups run by mr @entity216 and mr @entity217			2
it was not only @entity17 who saw potential security issues cropping up in @entity16 before the september 11 raid			2
@entity176 said officials felt ' like we were being asked to play the piano with two fingers ' after a number of troops were withdrawn from @entity16 in august			0
he told @entity136 that worried embassy staff had approached him to ask if they would still be safe when his team had left			0
' i could only answer that what we were being told is that they 're working on it , ' he said			0
he added : ' shooting instances occurred , many instances involved the local security guard force that we were training			0
aftermath : the @entity4 consulate in @entity5 the day after last month 's deadly assault ' constantly , there were battles going on between militias , criminal activity and that became an increasing danger as time went on as well			1
' @entity176 claimed that other senior officials , including @entity17 , had requested a boost in the @entity4 security presence , saying : ' we felt we needed more , not less			1
' although his team was based in the city 's capital @entity286 , @entity176 said he would have accompanied the ambassador to @entity5 had he still been in the country			0
@entity9 officials said that as the @entity177 was intended to help re-open the embassy in @entity286 , their departure from @entity16 was irrelevant to the subsequent security situation			0
they also claimed that @entity176 did not know the details of the situation in @entity5 , which is 400 miles from the capital			0
video : @entity11 and @entity1 talk about @entity16 during the debate ...			2

@entity1 said ' we were n't told ' that the consulate had asked for more security
insists intelligence *reports* linked raid to protests against @entity98 video
ambassador @entity17 , who was killed in attack , wrote cable warning militias could turn against @entity4 on day he died
@entity26 argues failings show @entity29 administration is *incompetent*
