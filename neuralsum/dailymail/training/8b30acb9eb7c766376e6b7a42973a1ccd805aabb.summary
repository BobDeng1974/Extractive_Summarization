the @entity0 yesterday came under fire for treating the christening of @entity3 as a ‘ tail end afterthought ’ on its flagship news programmes			2
while the historic occasion was featured on front pages around the world , @entity7 ’s half - hour news at six and ten gave it bottom billing			1
both programmes devoted just two minutes and 20 seconds to the ceremony on wednesday			1
@entity18 ’s current affairs show @entity19 failed to mention it at all			1
he added : ‘ the @entity0 is the national broadcaster			2
an event such as that should have been given greater prominence			2
‘ people will be very surprised to see that it was an “ and finally ” item bearing in mind that it is a slot usually reserved for non-serious items			2
’ the @entity0 ’s @entity46 found time only for a short pre-recorded clip about the christening which was narrated by royal correspondent @entity49			1
instead of exploring the historical significance of the event or seeking comment from royal experts , he restricted his report to a brief rundown of the guests as they left the @entity58 at @entity59			2
the short clip was placed last in the news agenda , just before the weather at 6.30pm			0
the @entity0 has received four complaints about its coverage of the christening on wednesday it was deemed even less important than the story of a venomous spider outbreak in a school in @entity69 and a segment on proposals to give motorists a five - minute grace period after parking tickets run out			1
the @entity75 recycled the same @entity77 clip , and also gave it bottom billing			0
on @entity19 at 10.30pm , the christening was omitted altogether			1
instead , presenter @entity80 interviewed controversial comic @entity81 , giving him a platform to espouse his desire for a political revolution			0
@entity33 mp @entity85 said : ‘ i ’m disappointed with the @entity0 ’s coverage on the royal christening , which is an important occasion in the life of the nation			1
the monarchy is a cherished institution in this country			0
it attracts more support than almost any other aspect of our national political life			0
‘ this is the first , formal occasion on which three heirs to the throne are in one place for well over 100 years			0
the public want to see and hear as much of this as possible			0
‘ it ’s disappointing that the @entity0 have chosen to relegate this to a tail end afterthought			0
’ @entity32 ( left ) said he was appalled by the coverage and @entity85 ( right ) was ' disappointed ' the royal christening was featured on the front pages of seven of the @entity111 ’s national newspapers , and on the front pages of newspapers around the world			1
@entity115 at 6.30pm and 10pm both devoted three minutes to the christening story , giving it top billing in the second half of each programme			1
the slot is typically reserved for major stories as the channel needs to regain the attention of its viewers after the advert break			0
@entity33 mp @entity126 said : ‘ the royal christening was an important national event which newspapers have given huge coverage to in response to their readers ’ desire to properly commemorate the event			1
‘ after a very difficult year , it ’s probably fair to suggest that the @entity0 is struggling to stay in touch with what its audience wants			0
’ @entity115 devoted three minutes to the christening , giving it top billing in the second half of the programme the @entity0 said it had received four complaints that its news coverage of the royal christening was insufficient			1
a spokesman added : ‘ the @entity0 provided extensive coverage of the royal christening across all platforms yesterday , including live coverage on the @entity150 , as well as a range of reports across our television bulletins and radio and online			2
‘ the christening was in the @entity7 bulletin headlines at both 6pm and 10pm , with a full report by our royal correspondent @entity49			1
' there were several major news stories yesterday , including the loss of many jobs following the shutdown of @entity167 ’s biggest industrial site , and @entity169 ’s announcement that day that the government will review green taxes in response to rising energy prices			0
all our reports are there because we judge them important and of audience interest			0

@entity7 's @entity46 and ten devoted two minutes and 20 seconds to event
@entity18 's current affairs show @entity19 failed to mention christening
mp @entity32 said he was ' appalled ' at the coverage
