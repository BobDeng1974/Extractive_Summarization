by @entity0 a hot new fashion label dressing everyone from @entity3 to @entity4 in the @entity5 has struck a chord on @entity8 shores			1
@entity8 fashion icons such as @entity10 , @entity11 and even @entity12 have been spotted wearing styles from the cool new reformation brand this summer			2
their cutting - edge co-ords , floral maxis and spaghetti strap slips have earned them a place in the most a-list of wardrobes			0
and the best bit : this celebrity label is actually affordable			0
with prices starting at £ 40 for a top and going up to about £ 150 for a dress , the profile of @entity5 's newest cult clothing label is about to soar			1
@entity10 out with @entity30 this month in @entity31 wearing a black floral print maxi halter dress by the reformation , @entity36 boots and a @entity38 purse celebrities like the label because everything is produced in limited amounts , meaning that it 's unlikely anyone will show up to an an event wearing the same thing as them			0
reformation dressmakers either up - cycle vintage threads or create something new out of leftover fabrics @entity52 , 25 , recently chose a pretty £ 150 cutaway maxi dress for the marriage of @entity55 and @entity56 in @entity57			1
designer and owner @entity58 , from @entity60 , hailed the style of prince @entity63 's former girlfriend during a recent interview with @entity65			0
' first of all i think @entity52 looked absolutely lovely , and second i ca n't tell you how rewarding these moments are for me			0
i know it 's a challenge to get dressed for a wedding , ' @entity58 said			0
@entity10 wears @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity73 , earlier this month ' so much of what i design is for a modern woman who does n't want to adjust her style or buy a dress she will never wear again - especially when it comes to getting dressed for a wedding			2
' @entity52 looked totally appropriate by accessorizing our @entity82 dress with heels and a clutch , and she would look equally appropriate throwing on a pair of sandals and wearing it to lunch with friends			0
' the brand has been flying under the radar since @entity93 started it as a sustainably conscious side project five years ago			1
but with two flagship stores in @entity60 and @entity96 and a growing list of celebrity clients , @entity58 can safely say it 's now a full - time job			2
@entity11 seen wearing a stunning @entity71 dress a few weeks ago while in @entity96 , with @entity102 & @entity103 sunglasses , @entity105 sweater and @entity107 sandals @entity4 , @entity108 and @entity3 - who has been seen in their cute polka - dot two piece - are all fans			1
the brand has had a celebrity following since the start thanks to their eco ethos , and figure - flattering designs and for those @entity120 after some of those festival - inspired , boho fashion vibes there 's even free shipping to the @entity8			2
@entity52 ( right ) chose a pretty cutaway maxi which cost a reasonable £ 150 ( left ) for a wedding @entity3 wearing a bralet and split skirt from @entity71 showing off a toned midriff in @entity96 @entity3 , joined by pal @entity127 , went shopping at the @entity71 flagship nyc store on monday @entity129 in @entity130 , £ 151 @entity131 in @entity132 , £ 87 @entity133 in ivory , £ 128 @entity135 in @entity136 , £ 116 @entity137 , @entity138 , £ 128 @entity139 in @entity140 , £ 151			1
