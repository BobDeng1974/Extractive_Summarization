@entity3 mortgage banker and avid golfer @entity2 was with three friends at the @entity5 near @entity6 , @entity17 , when he suddenly disappeared into the turf on the fairway of the 14th hole			1
the 43 - year - old fell into a bell - shaped enclosure below the green that measured 15 feet deep and 10 feet wide , surprising his golf pals and the course management who said this was the first time anything like this had happened in @entity28 's 20 - year history			2
' i noticed this anomaly in the fairway and went to have a look but , by the time i took one step , i was gone , i was underground , ' @entity2 told @entity35			1
' when i went through ( the opening ) i could n't see anything , i did n't know how far i was going or what i was going to hit			2
' he said , after plummeting through the earth , he landed on a pile of mud in a cavernous space that could have fit up to 10 people			1
' i was just lying on the side of the mound , ' he said			2
' there was some room in there , it was sort of like a room or a cave			2
it was very dark , though after a while my eyes got used to it			2
but i could n't look up because there was stuff still falling			2
' the rescue was precarious as no one knew whether the hole would expand , swallowing more people			1
the fact he dislocated his shoulder in the fall did n't help either			1
' i knew the only way to get out was straight up and i did n't have the use of my left arm , ' he said			2
sinkhole : the 43 - year - old fell into a bell - shaped enclosure below the green that measured 15 feet deep and 10 feet wide , pictured friends : @entity2 's friends , pictured , managed to hoist him out of the hole by tying a rope around his waist his friends - @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 - called the golf course 's pro shop and , armed with a rope and a ladder , general manager @entity79 rushed to help out			1
@entity82 , a local real estate agent with whom @entity2 had been playing golf for years , bravely volunteered to climbed down into the enclosure where he tied the rope around his friend 's waist so the team could pull him to safety			1
' @entity82 came down to get me			2
he made a sling out of his jacket and tied a rope around me , which the others used to pull me from the top and he pushed me from underneath , ' @entity2 said			1
the whole rescue took just 20 minutes , but the father said , during the terrifying ordeal , he could n't help but think of the sinkhole that two weeks ago swallowed 36 - year - old @entity105 man @entity104 , who remains missing			2
' that crossed my mind when i was actually falling			2
is this how i 'm going to go out ? in a sinkhole , ' @entity2 told @entity35			1
14th : the sinkhole opened up as @entity2 was standing on the fairway , pictured , of the 14th hole he said he was pretty eager to get out as soon as possible , fearing the ground beneath him would continue to sink			1
' i felt quite stable on the mud , but when i looked around me there were some cracks where there was just blackness so i think ( the hole ) was just going to keep going , ' he said			1
@entity2 pushed the thoughts of february 's deadly sinkhole out of his mind and focused on how he was going to get out with his left arm out of order			1
he also thought about how fortunate he was not to have been golfing alone that day			0
' if you 're playing by yourself and waiting for someone to find you you 'd be waiting a long time , ' he said			0
' fortunately , it was n't an elderly person or someone on their own			0
or an entire golf cart			0
we were told to park the carts off the ground that day			0
' @entity2 added : ' maybe i 'm lucky and unlucky , ' referring to having his friends on hand to help			1
while he never would have suspected a 15ft sinkhole on the course , @entity2 , who had played at @entity28 more than 10 times in the past , said he did notice something odd on the 14th hole fairway before he dropped through the earth			1
@entity146 golfer : @entity2 , pictured on another course , is an avid golfer but says he will probably not play at @entity28 again scene : the sinkhole opened up on the fairway of the 14th hole , circled , on @entity153 he said @entity81 was sizing up a shot and @entity83 and @entity82 were having a break in a wooded area nearby when he saw a dip on the green and went to take a look			1
' i noticed this anomaly in the fairway , it was a bathtub size depression , and i thought to myself " that is unfair to have that there , " he said			2
' it did n't look unstable , i was just thinking how would you play a shot from there			0
' recovering : @entity2 , pictured , is undergoing medical tests to make sure the dislocated shoulder is the only injury he came out of the hole with @entity2 is undergoing medical tests to make sure the dislocated shoulder is the only injury he came out of the hole with			1
he had an mri today to determine whether the arm requires surgery			0
the health scare is quite enough for 43 - year - old 's family , who have been supporting his wife , @entity183 , through chemotherapy for breast cancer			0
@entity183 wrote an account of her husband 's sinkhole survival on a golfing website @entity2 co-owns , golfmanna.com			1
' he was having a great round and lots of laughs with his buddies , ' she wrote			0
' @entity2 had already hit his second shot when he went to check out the distance for his playing partner , @entity81 , who was getting ready to hit			1
@entity81 had his back to @entity2 and when he turned to say something to him , @entity2 was gone			1
' @entity183 said @entity2 is claustrophobic and began to panic when he realized his predicament and his injury meant he was in excruciating pain			1
' the clubhouse respondents brought a 12 - foot ladder , which they put down the side of the hole and propped on a mound of mud within it , ' she wrote			1
' however , @entity2 was another six feet below that level and had dislocated his shoulder during the fall ; he only had the use of one arm and could n’t pull himself up to the ladder			1
' @entity183 said @entity81 called her once @entity2 was out of the hole and in an ambulance on his way to hospital			1
unbelievable : @entity2 's wife , @entity183 , pictured right , said the whole story was ' unbelievable ' ' as soon as i answered , i asked " what is wrong ? " she recalled			1
' he said , " @entity2 is fine , but he has had an accident and is in an ambulance			1
" i do n't think he knew how to tell me that my husband had just been swallowed by the earth			0
it just sounds too unbelievable ! ' she said when her husband told the story of what had happened she was ' dumbfounded			0
' ' i immediately thanked @entity234 that they were able to get him out ; i , too , could n't help but think of the recent news buzz about sinkholes and people being lost forever			2
' she said the bizarre incident reminds her of the movie @entity242 in which @entity243 disappears into the ground while playing golf			0
' we 're very fortunate that @entity2 was n't injured worse than he was – or even killed , ' she said			1
' it 's just another reminder to hold your loved ones close and thank @entity234 for all the blessings we 've been given			0
' geologist @entity252 said sinkholes are common around @entity254 because the limestone bedrock often dissolves in rainwater creating a cave below the surface			2
but he told the @entity259 the openings are generally visible			0
' this guy just really was in the wrong place at the wrong time , ' @entity252 said			0
@entity2 said the @entity28 course had been one of his favorites and he and his golf pals - the @entity268 - have enjoyed playing it for years			1
' it 's one of the better , if not the best public course in the area , ' he said			0
but while he 's sure to continue his golfing hobby after his shoulder recovers , @entity2 will be giving that particular green a wide berth			1
' i think its just a little too weird , ' he said			0
' i do n't think i 'd be very comfortable playing that hole again			2
' sinkhole graphic a sinkhole is a hole that opens up suddenly in the ground			1
they mostly occur because of erosion or underground water that gathers naturally or due to man - made activities			0
when this water dissolves the foundation beneath the surface layer , spaces and caverns develop underground			0
@entity293 , carbonate rock , and salt beds are particular vulnerable to this erosion			0
meanwhile , the top layer of @entity296 usually stays intact			0
when the dissolving area beneath the surface becomes too large , the surface suddenly gives way			2
while they often occur from natural causes , sinkholes can be man - made and caused by human activity			0
groundwater pumping and construction are the most likely culprits			0
they can also occur when water drainage systems are changed			0
according to the @entity309 , @entity105 , @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity11 , @entity312 , @entity313 , and @entity314 are the states most affected by sinkholes			0
but sinkholes are also common in the @entity254 region where the bedrock here is limestone			0
geologist @entity252 told the @entity259 that limestone can dissolve in rainwater to make an opening known as a ' conduit			0
' new openings usually reveal themselves during or immediately after a heavy downpour			0
' it 's a gradual process that creates a void in the soil , ' @entity252 told the newspaper			0
' over time , ( the void ) migrates upward through the soil to where the soil arch gets too thin to support the weight of what 's over it , and it collapses			0

@entity2 was with friends at the @entity5 near @entity6 when he suddenly disappeared into the turf on the fairway of the 14th hole
he landed on a pile of mud in the cavernous space that could have fit up to 10 people and looked like it was about to sink further
mortgage banker was hoisted out of the cave by his friends who climbed down a ladder to tie a rope around his waist
suffered a dislocated shoulder and has vowed not to return to the course
