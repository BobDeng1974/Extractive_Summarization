by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 's @entity2 produced a nerveless final round to win his first @entity6 title for seven years at the inaugural made in @entity9 event on sunday			1
@entity2 began the day tied for the lead with @entity12 ' @entity11 , but carded a closing 68 in front of massive crowds at @entity16 to finish nine under par. the 33 - year - old from @entity19 finished two shots clear of @entity11 , with @entity22 's @entity21 three shots further back in third and home favourite @entity25 joint fourth with @entity22 pair @entity27 and @entity29			1
title : @entity31 is closing in on his third @entity6 title at the made in @entity34 event @entity2 , who had suffered a number of near misses since the second of his @entity6 wins in 2007 , made the ideal start with birdies on the third and fourth and then hit his approach to within inches of the hole on the eighth			1
that seemed certain to give him a five - shot lead , only for playing partner @entity11 to hole from 18 feet after three bogeys and one birdie in the previous seven holes			0
@entity2 then dropped his first shot of the day after a wayward approach to the ninth and the gap was down to two when @entity11 , whose last tour win came in @entity57 in 2006 , birdied the 11th			2
@entity2 responded immediately with a birdie from six feet on the 12th , aided by seeing @entity11 narrowly miss on the same line from further away , but @entity11 was refusing to throw in towel			0
premier : made in @entity9 is in its inaugural year on the @entity6 victory : the 33 - year - old @entity3 golfer had not won a @entity6 title since 2007 the 41 - year - old reduced the gap again with a birdie from four feet on the 13th and looked in prime position to get closer still on the next			1
however , @entity2 holed from 50 feet across the green for an unlikely birdie - and looked somewhat embarrassed as the ball just toppled in the left side of the hole - and @entity11 did well to hole from 10 feet to remain two behind			0
@entity2 missed from just six feet for birdie on the par - three 16th , but then saw @entity11 miss his par putt from even closer after recovering from a greenside bunker			0
@entity11 hit back with a birdie on the 17th to get within two shots once again , but found an awkward lie on the edge of a fairway bunker and was unable to apply any more pressure as @entity2 held on for the win .			2

@entity2 produced *composed* final round to win first @entity6 title in seven years at inaugural made in @entity9 event
@entity92 finishes two shots clear of @entity94 @entity11 at @entity16
@entity22 's @entity21 was three shots further back in third
