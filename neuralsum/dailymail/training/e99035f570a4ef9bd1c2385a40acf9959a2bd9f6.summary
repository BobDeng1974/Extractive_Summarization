the @entity10 said it was ‘ viscerally opposed ’ to the plans , which were announced by exams watchdog @entity12 following evidence that teachers were inflating marks for pupils in laboratory work , which is internally assessed			1
sixth formers ’ practical skills will still be assessed , although marks will appear separately from the final @entity21 fears this will lead to laboratory skills being neglected by schools			2
crucial : the @entity10 says axing coursework for science students will harm skills practical work is vital to help teenagers progress into higher education or employment , it added , and the proposed change would lead to lab skills becoming ‘ neglected or de-prioritised ’			1
‘ while there are obvious challenges in the design and assessment of these skills , their importance means that the removal of marks from the final grade would be a significant step backwards and could undermine employer confidence in the qualification , ’ it said			0
‘ rather than remove these contributory marks , the focus should be on addressing the challenges outlined in the consultation document such as the issue of potential marking inconsistencies			1
’ @entity55 , the @entity10 's head of employment and skills , said the proposal could undermine employer confidence in the qualification and @entity12 should instead by focusing on tackling ‘ marking inconsistencies ’			1
‘ we want practical assessment in science because , frankly , science is a practical subject , ’ he said at an education conference in @entity62			0

we also want practical assessment in science because , frankly , science is a practical subject by its very nature			0
' @entity12 announced its intention to cut back on coursework in a range of a-levels three months ago in an attempt to clamp down on cheating			2
at the time it pointed out in some units marked by teachers , pupils ’ performance often ‘ greatly exceeds ’ their results in written exams			2
in future , it will only feature in qualifications where practical skills can not be assessed by an exam - such as in geography fieldwork or art. the exam board insisted yesterday that it had to tackle ‘ some intractable issues ’ including ‘ malpractice ’ and teachers focusing on ‘ the limited range of skills typically required for the assessments ’ .			0

exams watchdog @entity12 said teachers were inflating marks for lab work
but @entity10 said *scrapping* it would be harmful
@entity10 says @entity12 should instead focus on the ' inconsistencies ' themselves
