when @entity2 ’s beloved pet cat went missing , she was prepared to go to any lengths to find her			2
which was just as well ... because the mission to rescue @entity7 involved a transcontinental social media campaign , a 2,000 - mile return journey over land and sea and an emotional reunion in a @entity14 bar			2
the saga began when miss @entity2 , 27 , decided to return to the @entity16 in the @entity17 after four years of living in @entity18 , @entity19			1
@entity2 , 27 , decided to return to the @entity16 in the @entity17 after four years of living in @entity18 , @entity19 - but the primary school teacher wanted to bring her pet with her – but feared the journey by ferry , plane and coach would be too much for @entity7 , who she had nursed back to health after adopting her as a nervous and neglected stray			1
then a friend recommended a @entity17 - based company , @entity29 , which matches people with transport providers for shipments of all kinds and could bring @entity7 home more comfortably			2
miss @entity2 found positive reviews on the site for driver @entity37 , and accepted his quote of £ 700 to transport @entity7 from @entity39 to the @entity17 in an air - conditioned @entity41 van			1
she said : ‘ at the time i thought it would cause the least hassle , ironically			0
’ after launching a @entity47 campaign @entity45 received this photo ( left ) from a man named @entity50 who found @entity51 in a @entity52 - she then travelled back from @entity16 to @entity14 to pick up her pet the driver paid to transport @entity7 the cat ( pictured ) claimed he lost her after she bit him and escaped however , things began to go wrong when @entity56 - born @entity37 did not arrive on the agreed morning			1
he eventually turned up at 2am ‘ with excuse after excuse , including that he ’d had a flat tyre along the way ’			0
miss @entity2 added : ‘ his “ @entity69 ” van was a car that he was clearly living in , there was rubbish all over the back seat and @entity7 in her basket had to go in the boot			1
' but what was i supposed to do ? i had no other options			0
’ reluctantly , miss @entity2 waved off her pet and continued to the @entity17			1
but when @entity37 failed to answer her increasingly frantic calls and emails , she rang @entity29 , which sent the driver an email threatening to terminate his account			0
his response horrified her : ‘ there is a problem with the cat delivery from @entity39 … when i was cleaning the cage , the cat bit me and escaped … i been three days surching [ sic ] in @entity52 and could not find it again … i give up , as nobody there saw it			0
’ after finding out her beloved pet was missing , miss @entity2 wasted no time in spreading the word on social media – including posting pleas for help on the @entity47 pages of every bar and restaurant in @entity52 ( pictured ) miss @entity2 , who had already handed over £ 250 to @entity37 , said : ‘ i could n’t process that he ’d actually lost my cat three days ago and i was only finding out now			1
' i was so angry at myself for trusting him			0
’ she wasted no time in registering @entity7 ’s disappearance on @entity103 , @entity19 and @entity14 microchip databases and spreading the word on social media – including posting pleas for help on the @entity47 pages of every bar and restaurant in @entity52			1
and then , ten long days after she had last set eyes on her pet , miss @entity2 received a @entity47 message saying a cat fitting @entity7 ’s description was being looked after in a bar in @entity52			1
convinced by the grainy photograph , she leapt into action , getting a ferry from @entity121 to @entity122 and then hiring a car for the 12 - hour drive to @entity52 – and paying the bar £ 40 to stay open for an extra hour until she got there			0
she said : ‘ when i saw @entity7 i was so happy i did n’t know what to do with myself			0
' as soon as she heard my voice she started miaowing – which the manager said she had n’t done the whole time			0
’ @entity29 has refunded miss @entity2 ’s £ 100 handling fee , and she will now undertake legal proceedings against @entity37 to try to recover the money she paid him			2
a relieved miss @entity2 added : ‘ next time i go travelling with @entity7 it will have to be for a very good reason			2
’ when she received the photo of @entity140 caught a ferry from @entity121 to @entity122 and then hired a car for the 12 - hour drive to @entity52 – and even paid the bar £ 40 to stay open for an extra hour until she got there			0

@entity2 , 27 , decided to return to the @entity17 from @entity19 with her cat @entity7
journey by ferry , plane and coach would be too much for nervous pet
so she agreed to pay delivery driver £ 700 to transport cat from @entity18
but the driver lost the cat in @entity52 , claiming she escaped after biting him
miss @entity2 launched @entity47 campaign and tracked down @entity7
