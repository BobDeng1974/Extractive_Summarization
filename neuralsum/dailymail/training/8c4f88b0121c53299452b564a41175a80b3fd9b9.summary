by @entity0 published : 09:33 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 09:36 est , 6 august 2013 petrol and diesel cars would be banned entirely from @entity4 ’s roads by 2040 under @entity5 plans to force everyone to go green @entity8 ’s party has unveiled proposals to only allow ultra-low carbon vehicles , such as electric cars and hybrids , by that year			1
however , although ordinary petrol and diesel cars would be banned , such vehicles would still be allowed for freight purposes			2
thing of the past : @entity5 want only ultra-green low emissions cars on the roads within 30 years the move would pile further pressure on hard - pressed motorists , who are also having to cope with sky - high fuel bills			1
and – to attract the anger of drivers even more – the @entity5 would also like to see councils given the power to impose road tolls to ease congestion in city centres			0
the plans , which have the support of the party leadership , will be voted on by delegates at next month ’s @entity5 conference in @entity36			1
the controversial motion will be moved by @entity38 , co-chair of the party ’s official committee on environment and climate change , and a former manager of international freight company @entity45			0
if members vote yes , the policy will have to be included in the @entity5 manifesto for the next election			2
the idea of banning ordinary cars is contained in a policy paper entitled ‘ transition to a @entity4 ’ which will be debated in @entity36			0
it states : ‘ by 2040 , only ultra-low carbon vehicles will be permitted on @entity58 roads for non-freight purposes			0
’ in the years until the ban comes into force , the policy paper reveals that @entity5 want to charge higher taxes on petrol and diesel cars to persuade motorists to move towards greener alternative			1
going green : the cars clampdown is part of a raft of environmental policies being pushed by @entity8 's party at its annual conference next month cleaner vehicles would attract a subsidy , paid for by a higher ‘ vehicle emissions duty ’ on less environmentally friendly cars			1
the @entity5 also want to introduce a system of road pricing – that is , tolls – in congested areas			0
while the @entity84 ruled out imposing tolls on the existing road network during this side of the election , no promises have been given for the second half of the decade			0
the document said that party would prepare for the ‘ introduction of a revenue - neutral system of road pricing and support local authorities introducing road pricing in congested areas '			0
the @entity5 also want to replace air passenger duty with a ‘ per - plane duty , charged in proportion to the carbon emissions created by that journey ’			2
as part of the party ’s plans to create a ‘ zero - carbon ’ @entity4 , the @entity5 could also embrace nuclear power and shale gas exploration			1
the policy document says that gas fracking should be allowed as long as ‘ regulations controlling pollution and protecting local environmental quality are strictly enforced , planning decisions remain with local authorities and local communities are fully consulted over extraction and fully compensated for all damage to the local landscape ’ .			2

@entity8 's party wants everyone to drive low carbon cars within 30 years
only freight *lorries* would be allowed to create high levels of pollution
plan will become @entity5 policy at annual conference next month
