by @entity0 published : 14:29 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 14:40 est , 11 february 2013 @entity1 , 49 , pictured coming out of her house in @entity3 , @entity4 , in august a few days before her arrest the confidante of @entity8 murderer @entity9 is to avoid charges over claims that she failed to tell police about a letter which may have revealed the whereabouts of his only undiscovered victim			1
@entity1 , @entity18 's mental health advocate for 13 years , had been arrested on suspicion of preventing the lawful burial of @entity20 after she told a television documentary that the killer had given her a sealed envelope to pass on to @entity20 's mother @entity9 when he died			1
the letter was never found and @entity9 died last august with her heartbreaking search for the body of her 12 - year - old son still unresolved			1
@entity29 , head of the @entity30 , said : ' after careful consideration , we have decided that ms @entity1 should not be charged , as it can not be established that she knew the contents of the letter referred to , that the letter in question existed or what information it might have contained			1
' the only evidence of the letter ’s existence was in comments given by ms @entity1 to an interviewer and she stated only that she believed it may contain information about @entity20			1
' mr @entity29 added : ' the only offence that might have been committed by ms @entity1 was preventing a lawful and decent burial			1
' it is possible to prosecute a person for preventing a lawful burial through a failure to act , but there must be sufficient evidence to prove that the suspect either prevented the burial or intended to do so when they chose not to act			0
' he said : ' even if it could be proved that this letter existed , there is no evidence to suggest that ms @entity1 ever knew the nature of its contents and there is insufficient evidence to prove that she genuinely believed it contained the information in question			1
' as such , it could not be established in court that ms @entity1 either prevented @entity20 ’s burial or intended to do so			1
' we understand that this is still a very sensitive matter for the relatives of @entity20			2
' we have written to @entity20 ’s brother to explain our decision and have offered a meeting to discuss this matter			0
' allegations : miss @entity1 had said in a television documentary that killer @entity9 , left , had written a letter to @entity9 , mother of one of @entity18 's victims @entity20 , right , whose body has never been found @entity20 is the only one of the five victims of child killers @entity9 and @entity87 whose body was never found			1
he was snatched by the pair as he walked to his grandmother 's house in @entity91 , @entity92 on june 16 1964			0
his mother @entity93 dedicated the rest of her life to trying to find her son 's remains , but died of cancer aged 78 last summer			0
she had visited @entity99 , which overlooks @entity100 , @entity92 , thousands of times and had written numerous letters to @entity18 pleading for information as to @entity20 's whereabouts			1
@entity1 had become in embroiled in controversy when she spoke about the existence of a letter that @entity18 had said might help mrs @entity109 ' find peace ' when she took part in @entity112 documentary @entity111 last year			1
tragic : @entity20 's mother @entity9 , pictured , never gave up the search for her son 's missing body , but died last august without knowing his whereabouts police raided her @entity119 home but were unable to find the letter			1
she was arrested last august			0
@entity122 , head of investigative review in @entity118 ’s major and cold case crime unit , said : ' as soon as we were made aware of the existence of this alleged letter , we made exhaustive attempts to obtain it to establish whether or not its contents would assist us in finding @entity20 ’s body			2
' that resulted in the warrants we carried out in the @entity119 area and at @entity136 in august 2012			0
' however , despite seizing numerous documents and a search of @entity18 ’s cell , no such letter has been recovered			2
' that in itself does not prove or disprove the letter ’s existence			0
it might have been destroyed , it might be hidden elsewhere , it may be in someone else ’s possession , or it may simply never have existed in the first place and this has been yet more mind games by @entity18			0
no clues : police dogs digging during the search for victims ' bodies on @entity99 in 1985 continued hunt : forensics officers from @entity118 searching for the body of @entity20 , whose body was never found after he was killed by @entity9 and @entity87 ' what i can say for certain is that we have not recovered the letter itself nor any credible information that would help us find @entity20			1
' mr @entity122 added : ' as a result , we have liaised with the @entity168 who have concluded there is no realistic prospect of any criminal conviction and therefore no further action will be taken against the woman we arrested			0
' i do want to make this point however : this whole episode about the letter came at a time when @entity93 was sadly in her final days			0
' @entity93 and the rest of her family have suffered unimaginable torment			0
jailed : @entity18 's accomplice @entity87 died while still in prison in 2002 aged 60			1
she confessed that the pair had killed @entity20 in 1987 ' @entity20 still has surviving relatives who deserve to know the truth and @entity118 will continue to act on any credible evidence to bring this torment to an end			0
' the other victims of @entity18 and @entity87 were @entity191 , 16 , who disappeared on her way to a disco on july 12 1963 ; @entity194 , 12 , who was snatched in november the same year ; @entity195 , 10 , who was lured away from a funfair on @entity197 1964 , and @entity9 , 17 , who was axed to death in october 1965			1
@entity18 was jailed for life at @entity200 in 1966 for the murders of @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity9			2
@entity87 was convicted of killing @entity195 and @entity9 and shielding @entity18 after @entity29 ’s murder , and jailed for life			2
in 1987 the pair finally admitted killing @entity20 and @entity204			0
both were taken back to @entity99 to help police find the remains of their victims but only @entity210 ’s body was found			2
@entity18 claimed he could not remember where he had buried the boy			2
in 2009 , police said a covert search operation on the moor which used a wealth of scientific experts had also failed to discover any trace of @entity20			2
@entity18 was due to go before a mental health tribunal last year , but it was delayed after he suffered a seizure			1
the tribunal was to consider his application to be transferred to a prison and be allowed to die			0
he has been tube - fed since refusing food 12 years ago			0
the re-listed hearing is due to take place in @entity92 in june .			0
