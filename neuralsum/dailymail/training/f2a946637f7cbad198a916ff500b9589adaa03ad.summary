by @entity0 published : 10:27 est , 27 june 2012 updated : 13:36 est , 27 june 2012 a man who was convicted for tweeting a joke about blowing up an airport received celebrity backing as he challenged his fine today			2
@entity6 was flanked by @entity7 and @entity8 as three judges , headed by the lord chief justice , lord judge , started a review of his case at the @entity12			1
the post in question read : ' c * * p ! @entity16 is closed			2
you 've got a week and a bit to get your s * * * together , otherwise i 'm blowing the airport sky high ! ' the accountant said he sent the tweet to his 600 followers in a moment of frustration after the airport in @entity29 was closed by snow in january 2010			1
he claimed it was sent in jest and he never thought anyone would take his ' silly joke ' seriously			0
@entity36 martyr : @entity6 ( centre ) arrives at the @entity12 in @entity38 with celebrity supporters @entity7 and @entity8 but he was fined £ 385 and ordered to pay £ 600 costs at @entity41 in may 2010 after being convicted of sending ' a message of a menacing character ' , contrary to provisions of the @entity45			1
in november 2010 , @entity47 judge @entity46 , sitting with two magistrates , dismissed his appeal , saying that the electronic communication was ' clearly menacing ' and that airport staff were sufficiently concerned to report it			2
but opening a new bid to overturn his conviction and sentence today , @entity54 @entity53 told @entity57 , mr @entity58 and mr justice @entity59 that the wrong legal tests had been applied			1
he said that the message was sent on a timeline on the @entity36 facility to mr @entity6 ' followers and not as a randomly searched - for communication , and the relevant section of the @entity45 was never intended by @entity67 to deal with messages to the ' world at large '			1
@entity6 speaking on @entity36 today about his court case and the support he has received not all threats were menaces , counsel said			1
to constitute a menace , he added , the threat must be of such a nature that the mind of an ' ordinary person of normal stability and courage ' might be influenced			0
also , the person sending the message must intend to threaten the person to whom the message was sent - in other words , it was a crime of specific intent			0
mr @entity6 ' right to freedom of speech under the @entity91 was engaged , he told the court			1
tv star @entity8 , pictured here on his compete for the meat with @entity8 show , is a supporter of mr @entity6 turning from the law to technology , he said that the @entity99 did not ' bite ' as the social media platform involved was ' a content service ' and therefore outside the definition of both public electronic communication service and public electronic network			1
comedian @entity8 was one of mr @entity6 ' supporters who was at the @entity12 today			1
he said he was there because he found the conviction ' monstrously unjust '			2
he said : ' he ( mr @entity6 ) made a passing remark to his followers , to his friends , to people who joined in with his way of looking at the world			1
' it was found randomly by someone else and the law has , like one of those @entity120 10 - tonne weights , dropped on top of him			0
' ' the funniest thing is hearing it [ the tweet ] read out in court by a qc in his wig			2
even when it 's said deadpan by a qc it 's funny , it 's obviously a joke , ' he added			0
mr @entity6 , 28 , listened as mr @entity54 said it was obvious the tweet was a joke - not intended to be taken seriously by anyone and sent by someone who did not hide his identity			1
it was certainly not sent in the context of terrorism and it was wrong for the @entity47 to make such an association			0
he said : ' if that be the case , and i do n't mean to be flippant , @entity142 would be concerned when he said ‘ come , friendly bombs , and fall on @entity146 ' , or @entity147 when he said ‘ let 's kill all the lawyers '			0
' lord judge commented : ' that was a good joke in 1600 and it is still a good joke now			0
' mr @entity54 : ' and it was a joke , my lord			0
' turning back to the case , he added : ' this was no ultimatum of a serious kind to the airport			0
the last thing this particular tweeter wanted was for the airport to be closed			0
' he told the judges that @entity36 was invented in 2006 so was not known to @entity67 at the time of the @entity99			0
@entity53 , for the @entity165 , said that , on any view , mr @entity6 , a man of previous good character , was ' very foolish ' to do what he did			1
the question was , by whose standards and by what members of society would such a message be viewed as a joke , given that those who had access to it would probably not have any knowledge of the circumstances which led to it being sent			0
he said the @entity47 was right to refer to terrorism , not because it perceived the message as indicating a possible threat , but because it was concerned that after the tweet was sent , mr @entity6 sent messages to his girlfriend referring to terrorism			1
' these were not posted on the timeline and the court relied on them to demonstrate the accuracy of their finding that mr @entity6 was aware , and must have been aware , of the possible impact of his message on any member of the public of reasonable fortitude who might have seen it			2
' judgement was reserved until a later date .			0

@entity6 sent the tweet to his 600 followers in a moment of frustration
he was then fined £ 385 and ordered to pay £ 600 costs in may 2010
