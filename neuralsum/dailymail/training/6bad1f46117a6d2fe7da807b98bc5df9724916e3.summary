by @entity0 the @entity1 is ‘ grotesquely over managed ’ and has always had a ‘ broadly liberal ’ bias , one of its leading journalists has admitted			1
@entity6 said the corporation ’s reporting on issues such as immigration and the @entity11 has not been sufficiently sceptical			1
but while the today presenter ’s comments merely confirm what many of the @entity1 ’s critics have known for years , his analysis of the reasons for its left - wing bias is more contentious			1
the 70 - year - old said that @entity1 staff are more likely to be liberal rather than conservative because they are the ‘ best and the brightest ’ and tend to be university educated			1
critic : @entity6 saif the @entity1 was not sceptical enough on some issues ‘ the @entity1 has tended over the years to be broadly liberal as opposed to broadly conservative for all sorts of perfectly understandable reasons , ’ he told the @entity25			1
‘ the sort of people we ’ve recruited – the best and the brightest – tended to come from universities and backgrounds where they ’re more likely to hold broadly liberal views than conservative			1
’ on the @entity1 ’s reporting , he said : ‘ we were n’t sufficiently sceptical – that ’s the most accurate phrase – of the @entity39 case			1
we bought into the @entity41 ideal			2
‘ we were n’t sufficiently sceptical about the pro-immigration argument			1
we did n’t look at the potential negatives with sufficient rigour			2
’ @entity47 's @entity46 colleague @entity45 also criticised the broadcaster in the @entity25 @entity6 claimed the @entity1 is no longer so biased towards the @entity11 , saying : ‘ i think we ’re out of that now			1
i think we have changed			2
’ but he broadened his criticisms of his employer by saying it has too many managers and needs to be slimmed down			2
he said : ‘ there are too many of them			2
i think they think that			2
i think [ director general ] @entity57 thinks that – i do n’t know , i have n’t asked him , but i think he thinks that			0
‘ over the years we ’ve been grotesquely over-managed , there ’s no question			0
they ’re now getting a grip on it			0
i think more need to go			0
’ this is not the first time @entity6 has publicly attacked the @entity1			1
in january , he said the corporation is too big and is obsessed by ‘ box - ticking ’			0
in the @entity25 interview @entity6 also dismissed reports that he and his fellow today programme presenter @entity72 do not get on			0
in 2009 , it was reported that she felt humiliated by him on an episode of @entity76 , which he hosts , when he asked her whether she had her job only because she is good looking			0
but @entity6 said there is no ill - feeling and the remarks were taken out of context			0
he said : ‘ i was making the point that it helps in the newsreading business – and this is n’t controversial , you only have to switch on the telly – to be young and beautiful and highly trained			0
she ’s a proper journalist			0
’ writing in the same edition of @entity25 , @entity6 ’ radio 4 colleague @entity45 , who presents @entity89 , also criticised the @entity1 ’s management culture			1
he wrote : ‘ at @entity89 , we tried to start a new project , and to get approval we had to spend three weeks in meetings with different bits of the @entity1			1
we dutifully dealt with all their queries and eventually got the go - ahead			0
hooray ! ‘ two days after starting the project , another part of the corporation showed up and told us to stop			0
’ he added : ‘ there is always time for dissing other parts of the corporation and whining about how things used to be better			0
‘ but i ’ve been told to stop all that , it ’s unprofessional			0
’ last year @entity57 said the @entity1 could have responded to accusations of left - wing bias sooner and needed to include a greater range of opinions on @entity41 .			1

broadcaster says @entity1 is not ' sceptical ' enough about some issues
but he says bias is down to broadcaster *attracting* ' best and brightest '
he also says the @entity1 needs to be *trimmed* down in size
