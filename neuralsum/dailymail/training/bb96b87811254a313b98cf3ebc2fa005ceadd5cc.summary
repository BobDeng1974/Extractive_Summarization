by @entity0 published : 18:21 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 18:22 est , 7 october 2013 access denied : @entity2 could benefit 1,000 patients a year but is deemed to lack evidence of benefits patients in @entity7 and @entity8 are being denied a lung cancer drug that will be available to hospitals in @entity11			1
@entity2 can halt the advance of the disease for almost eight months on average			1
but the treatment , which costs £ 4,000 a month , has been deemed too expensive by the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) for use south of the border			2
however in the latest example of health apartheid , the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) is to give the green light for the drug to be used within @entity24			1
taxpayers in @entity7 and @entity8 will contribute to the general funding , but will not benefit from it			1
the drug , which was fast - tracked for use in the @entity30 last year , is designed for patients with a specific genetic mutation – called @entity33 positive – in non-small cell lung cancer			1
it is estimated that 1,000 patients a year could benefit from the drug			2
trials suggest a doubling of time on average before the cancer progressed , up from three months to 7.7 months			0
critics of @entity16 said the case for a fundamental overhaul was now overwhelming			0
this year alone , the body has failed to recommend any new cancer medicines from the 11 appraisals on which it has made decisions			0
at last week ’s @entity53 party conference , @entity51 was forced to announce a two - year extension to the £ 200million - a - year @entity55 – which pays for treatments denied by @entity16			0
following the crizotinib announcement , @entity53 mp @entity57 said : ‘ while this is tremendous news for cancer patients in @entity11 , we once again have to question why @entity16 has rejected another cancer drug for use in @entity7			1
‘ improving the lives of cancer patients should be their key priority			0
@entity7 runs the risk of lagging behind @entity68 when it comes to research and development in life sciences and the use of pioneering , lifesaving drugs			2
‘ reform of @entity16 so they put the improved access to treatments for patients first is vital so that we end what increasingly looks like a lottery when it comes to access for drugs			0
’ rapid help : the new drug halts the advance for non-small cell lung cancer for eight months , more than double the time for chemotherapy professor @entity89 , chairman of thoracic medical oncology at the @entity91 , said : ‘ given the high incidence of lung cancer in @entity11 and the fact that many of these patients do not respond to chemotherapy , this is welcome news for @entity11 patients			1
‘ however , this decision also shines the spotlight on a major issue facing @entity104 cancer patients – that their treatment choices and potential outcomes are seemingly dependent on where they live			0
’ @entity109 , of drug - maker @entity110 , said : ‘ this raises important questions about @entity16 and how , armed with the same information , it can reach an entirely different conclusion on the value of this medicine			2
’ sir @entity118 , @entity16 chief executive , said : ‘ we were disappointed not to be able to add crizotinib as a treatment option for patients in @entity7 and @entity8			1
health services have to be confident that the extra benefit to patients justifies the price			0
‘ if we are not sure , we have to say so , in the interests of all those of us who expect the @entity24 to apply its resources equitably across all of the demands we make of it			0
‘ these judgments are frequently finely balanced and although @entity16 and the @entity19 usually reach similar conclusions , it is inevitable that we will differ from time to time			2

@entity2 is a powerful new drug that can halt the advance of lung cancer
but the medicine *regulator* for @entity7 and @entity8 say it is too expensive
meanwhile the @entity19 have waved it through
critics have described the difference in *availability* as ' a lottery '
