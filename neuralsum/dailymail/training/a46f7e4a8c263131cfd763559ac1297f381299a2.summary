he often gets mistaken for @entity2 dj @entity1 so when @entity3 heard the festival headliner was coming to @entity5 he decided to spend three hours impersonating him - with hilarious results			1
it 's a case of mistaken identity for the 26 - year - old , who has spent the last five years being compared to his doppelgänger at music festivals , bars , on @entity13 and even on the streets of @entity15			2
since the photographer from @entity5 already shares @entity1 ’s trademark scraggly long black hair – he thought it would be a brilliant idea to get his friends together to give him the complete @entity1 makeover			1
' people already yell out ' it 's @entity1 ' on the streets when i 'm not even trying to look like him so the idea clicked in my head after i saw the @entity35 catcall video the other week			1
' i thought if i deliberately dress like @entity1 and get a fake beard - i would have a pretty high chance that people would think it 's him			1
the video shows @entity40 strolling around @entity41 in @entity5 on sunday - the second day of @entity42 - before being approached by festival goers for a ‘ selfie ’ or group photo			1
' the funniest moment was when the real @entity1 started his set on stage and just the look on people 's faces - they were confused when i walked past them and one guy had to double check and he even asked me why i was n't on stage			2
' i even did a crowd surf when @entity1 was playing and he pointed at me a few times			2
' can the real @entity1 ( right ) please stand up ? @entity40 impersonated the dj at @entity42 for three hours confused festival goers start questioning @entity40 when they realise the @entity59 @entity1 is playing on stage donning a baseball jacket , an @entity63 feather headdress , a pair of sunnies and finishing the look with a fake beard , @entity40 kept excited fans fooled at the music festival			1
' i could n't decide which outfit to wear - @entity1 's a crazy character so i set my friends up to bring along some crazy outfits to wear , ' he told @entity28			2
' i had to line up for a while so i could get change in the portaloo - and i had to keep my head down because i was getting a lot of comments			0
' i knew that i would do this for a while so i wanted to make the most of it and i had to buy the stereo ticket to make this happen - it was the first ticket i bought in a really long time - so i had to go all out			0
' when @entity1 hit the stage , more festivalgoers were fooled and confused as to why the @entity1 was part of the crowd the photographer from @entity5 was inspired by the @entity35 catcall video so he wanted to do something similar others are heard screaming out : ‘ @entity1 ! ’ ‘ @entity95 … ’ ‘ @entity96 ! it ’s @entity1 ! ’ while they appear to touch his arm , stroke his hair and give him hugs in the video			1
but when the real @entity1 hit the stage , confused festivalgoers are heard questioning @entity40 , ‘ but … you ’re way up there ? ’ or ‘ you should be on da stage ' and ‘ what are you doing @entity1 ? ’ as the crowd cheered on the electro - house @entity1 , @entity40 is seen on top of a man ’s shoulder singing before running through the crowd			2
' this one guy was so happy to see me when the real @entity1 was playing on stage - he knew that i was n't the real @entity1 but he wanted to be involved in the idea , ' @entity3 said			1
' so he carried me on top of his shoulders - and he was n't a big guy - but he carried me to the front			0
' i would do it again if the opportunity comes back but i do feel bad for all the people i tricked			0
some people were quite nice and sweet and asked for photos but i felt bad			0
' @entity40 was approached by ' hundreds ' of festivalgoers and excited fans who wanted a ' selfie ' one of @entity3 ’s friends , who works in radio , interviewed @entity1 and mentioned that his friend ‘ pretended to be like you ’			1
@entity1 laughs and responds : ‘ yeah , i saw a dude up there that looked like me			0
i think i pointed at him a few times			0
’ ' my friend dropped by when i was editing the video and coincidently , he told me that he was going to interview @entity141 on the show so i told him it would be funny to bring it up , ' @entity3 said			2
@entity3 's video , ' three hours of silent walking through @entity42 in @entity5 … as @entity1 ’ while he is seen in different styles of outfits - matching the same style of fashion as @entity1 ' has received almost half a million hits since it was posted on tuesday night			1
the real @entity1 : the @entity1 told a radio station that he actually saw someone who looked like him at @entity154 the video was posted onto @entity156 on tuesday night and has received almost half a million hit a caption alongside the video said : ‘ yeah so i get mistaken for @entity1 a lot			1
it 's been a weekly thing for the past five years ... at music festivals , bars , on @entity13 ... it even happened on the streets of @entity15 once			0
' i wondered what would happen if i did the same thing ... but dressed as @entity1			0
‘ this is the dumbest thing i 've done in a long time ...			0
i do feel a little bit bad about the hundreds of selfies i was asked to be in ...			0
i owe you guys a beer or two )			0
