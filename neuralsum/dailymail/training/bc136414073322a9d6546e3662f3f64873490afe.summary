transformation : @entity1 was born in the @entity2 but married a @entity4 physician who owned a plantation a @entity7 - era abolitionist woman went from supporting the end of slavery to calling the race ‘ ungrateful ’ and people who ‘ drive me to be tight and stingy with them			1
’ this is the stunning story of @entity1 , who was originally from @entity15 , @entity16 , and eventually married @entity17 , a physician who owned a plantation in @entity19			1
the woman from the @entity2 wrote a series of letters from the time of her marriage in 1853 until 1867 , two years after the end of the @entity7			2
mrs @entity1 ’ letters will be put on display in @entity28 , @entity29 , in honour of @entity29 ’s @entity31 , and show her gradual shift of opinions on slavery and of those oppressed			1
in 1853 , a 26 - year - old @entity1 married @entity36 and entered into a new life in the @entity4			1
the plantation owner had courted her for some eight years , as she was extremely reluctant to marry him and move to the @entity4 , according to the book @entity40 : documents of the @entity42			1
once she was settled at @entity43 , a working plantation , she wrote her parents to describe that the 37 slaves on the property were ‘ treated with more familiarity than many @entity47 servants			2
’ she confided to her parents : ‘ i feel confused			2
everything is so different that i do not know which way to stir for fear of making a blunder			2
settling in : in a series of letters written over several years , mrs @entity1 detailed her new life on a @entity4 plantation @entity58 ? though she began as an abolitionist , mrs @entity1 ' views on blacks gradually shifted ' i have seen enough to convince me that the ill - treatment of the slaves is exaggerated at the @entity2 but i have not seen enough to make me like the institution			1
’ according to the @entity67 , ms @entity66 had wrestled with only two things about mr @entity17 before marrying him			0
‘ one is his owning slaves , ’ she wrote			0
‘ i can not make it seem right and yet perhaps there may be my sphere of usefulness			0
‘ the other is not being a professing @entity77			0
’ however , neither stopped her from marrying mr @entity17 , and indeed , she wrote in several letters that his love of her was great			2
‘ my husband is all kindness and loves me more than i am worthy , ’ she wrote			0
they went on to have five children together			0
oppressed : a group of slaves outside their log cabin between 1860 and 1864 ( file photo ) ; when she married , mrs @entity1 became the mistress of 37 slaves when tensions were rising and the nation was on the threshold of the @entity7 , mrs @entity1 said she ’d rather go barefoot or wear homemade stockings than buy them from slaves			1
but living in the @entity4 seemed to gradually alter her perceptions			0
in 1862 , she commented : ‘ the little folks and “ contrabands ” are oppressing themselves with sugarcane			0
’ in august of 1867 , mrs @entity1 wrote of her experiences with newly - freed hired help			1
‘ three have run away during the last few months , ’ she told her parents			0
‘ they came to us naked ( all but ) they are an ungrateful race , they drive me to be tight and stingy with them			1
’ author @entity109 of the @entity111 ’s @entity110 will publish a book about her dramatic change of heart , entitled @entity114 : from @entity47 woman to @entity116			0
as any historian would say , @entity118 's @entity117 did free the slaves , though the societal and cultural norms were much more difficult to overcome			0
and as these letters reveal , geography and influence can speak in volumes to one 's paradigms .			1

@entity1 was raised in @entity16 but married *southern* plantation owner
letters reveal gradual paradigm shift from abolitionist to one who said that blacks were ' ungrateful ' and made her want to be ' tight and stingy with them '
