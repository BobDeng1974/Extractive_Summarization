the poster produced by @entity3 to advertise their big @entity13 tie with @entity10 non-league @entity3 will come up against the likes of @entity26 when they take on @entity10 in the fourth round of the @entity13 on wednesday evening in the biggest game of the club 's history the @entity3 badge based : @entity31 , @entity8 nickname : the @entity15 colours : @entity34 ground : @entity22 capacity : 4,000 ( 150 seated ) founded : 1875 but that is roughly the number expected to make the 35 - mile journey to @entity40 in @entity41 to cheer on their youth team against the mighty @entity44			1
the only non-league outfit left in this season 's @entity13 , @entity31 started their run back on september 10 and have seen off @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 to set up this attractive fixture with the seven - time @entity13 winners			1
they will come up against such highly - rated youngsters @entity26 , @entity58 and @entity59 , all youth internationals			0
the last two have been involved with @entity63 's first team			0
for @entity66 president @entity67 , entering his 40th year of involvement at the club , it 's a moment to savour			2
he told the @entity68 : ' as far as the history of the club goes , it 's a stand - out moment for us			2
' we 're the only non-league team left in the competition and it 's a great achievement by the boys to reach this stage			2
' it 's the furthest we 've ever been			0
we 've had a few small rund in the @entity78 with the first team , but we 've often been knocked out in the earlier round of the competition			2
' it 's got everyone at the club talking			0
' this @entity13 run is certainly up there - the furthest @entity31 have reached in the @entity78 , the competition for non-league sides , is the fifth round and they have never been beyond the third qualifying round in the @entity91			1
the first team finished seventh in @entity17 last season but they were 10 points shy of the play - offs			0
@entity10 winger @entity58 , 17 , has experience of playing for @entity63 's first team the talented @entity59 could also feature in the fourth round @entity13 tie at @entity41 @entity99 vs @entity100 ( 7pm , live on @entity101 ) @entity102 vs @entity103 ( 7pm ) @entity10 vs @entity3 ( 7pm ) @entity104 vs @entity105 ( 7pm ) the youth team , led by @entity107 , are still unbeaten in the @entity108 , @entity109 and perhaps that explains why @entity10 are taking nothing for granted			1
@entity112 playmaker @entity26 , who has drawn comparisons to @entity114 , told the club 's official website : ' if course we 're going to take it seriously			1
you have to win your game			0
if you do n't , you 're out			0
there is a lot more pressure on you to win			0
' the winners of wednesday night 's tie will host @entity127 in the fifth round .			1
