@entity1 support for @entity3 ’s @entity2 has soared to an all - time high 25 per cent – enough for the party to take @entity5 by storm with well over 100 mps and a possible @entity9 victory			1
that is the shock result of a @entity13 poll for @entity14 , carried out after @entity2 rocked the @entity15 and @entity9 in two by - elections last week			1
if the poll result was repeated in next year ’s general election , it would see the @entity15 lose 100 seats , the certain resignation of @entity22 – and the possibility of @entity24 in @entity25			1
the sensational @entity13 poll shows the @entity15 and @entity9 level pegging on 31 per cent , six ahead of @entity2 , with the @entity44 on a paltry eight			1
pollsters were quick to point out last night that the surge in support for @entity2 , buoyed by its success in last week ’s @entity51 by - election , could fall away in the run - up to the general election , as has happened in the past with other so - called minor parties , such as the @entity57			1
but it is the strongest evidence yet that @entity2 is on the brink of a major breakthrough which could change the political landscape forever			0
it means @entity3 could be closer than ever to his dream of holding a ministerial post			2
@entity2 have risen dramatically in the polls since april 2012 when they languished on 9 % with little hope of an mp @entity22 and @entity3 are the most popular duo to run the country according to the poll according to the poll , one in four voters now support his self - styled ‘ @entity73 ’			1
according to @entity75 , professor of politics at @entity77 , the poll would give @entity9 253 mps , conservatives 187 , @entity2 128 , @entity44 11 , and others , including @entity40 @entity81 and @entity83 mps , 71			2
prof @entity75 said : ‘ if @entity2 are to turn votes into @entity87 seats in @entity89 ’s first - past - the - post system , they need to build up bastions of local strength			0
today ’s poll suggests they may have begun to do that			0
‘ the 25 per cent level represents a 22 - point increase on the three per cent the party won in 2010			0
if that increase were to occur evenly in every constituency , they could still fail to pick up a single seat			0
‘ but today ’s poll suggests @entity2 ’s support has increased much more in the @entity103 outside @entity104 than it has elsewhere in the @entity89 – by a staggering 34 points			0
‘ if that level was recorded throughout the @entity103 , @entity2 could win as many as 128 seats , with no less than 102 of them coming from the conservatives , whose vote in the region is down 14 points			1
in that event , @entity22 would be left with just 187 seats , almost as weak a position as the @entity109 were in after their calamitous defeat in 1997			1
almost 60 per cent of people agree with @entity3 that @entity120 positive immigrants should not be allowed into the @entity89 @entity22 is the most trusted leader in all things apart from fixing a shelf , where @entity3 excels ‘ mr @entity3 would achieve his ambition of holding the balance of power at @entity125			1
any poll estimate of what is going on in an individual region is inevitably not as robust as that for the country as a whole			2
however , if @entity2 are advancing more strongly in some parts of the @entity103 , its chances of establishing itself as a significant force at @entity125 may well be higher than has so far been appreciated			0
’ the survey dramatically bears out @entity22 ’s warnings that a vote for @entity3 will give the no 10 keys to @entity24			1
but it also demonstrates his problems in neutralising the @entity2 threat			0
@entity109 voters are opposed to any kind of @entity9 pact with @entity3 , whereby @entity2 candidates would stand aside for conservatives – and vice versa – in key seats			1
paradoxically , while the survey shows the rise in @entity2 could make @entity24 prime minister , other aspects suggest @entity24 is in danger of becoming a joke figure			1
when respondents are asked if they can imagine him as prime minister , he comes behind @entity158 – and @entity3			2
he is seen as @entity9 ’s second worst leader in a third of a century , behind @entity161 and only slightly ahead of @entity162			0
by contrast , @entity22 is seen as the second best @entity109 leader since @entity165			2
the survey underlines the growing status of @entity3 and his party			2
his controversial call for immigrants who are @entity120 positive to be banned from entering @entity89 is supported by an overwhelming 58 per cent to 22			0
and voters appear to be warming to the idea of him having a government role after the next election			0
when respondents were asked which combination of the four main party leaders they would like to run @entity89 , a @entity180 ‘ coalition ’ comes top , followed by @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183			0
@entity3 is also the leader people would ask to fix a shelf , but least trusted to babysit , feed a pet or bake a cake			1
and , although a minority , one in three , believe @entity3 is fit to be a cabinet minister , his fans are in no doubt as to which job he should get			2
immigration minister is the clear favourite , followed by deputy prime minister and @entity198 minister			0
@entity13 interviewed 1,003 people online on friday			0
voters consider @entity24 the fifth - best @entity9 leader ever , while @entity22 is only second to @entity165			1

@entity22 *remains* the most trusted political leader in the poll
but @entity3 is on track to win 128 seats at the general election
the @entity15 could lose more than 100 seats allowing in @entity24
polls suggest the *public* want @entity22 and @entity3 to run the country
