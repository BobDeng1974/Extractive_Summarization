shortly before making the tackle , @entity2 joked , ' i do n't want to hurt you ' while he watched @entity6 flick the ball right and left			0
the @entity42 international took the applause as he ended up with the ball , but he may be relieved at getting back to his day job and facing up to more conventional opponents when he next lines up for @entity3			0
