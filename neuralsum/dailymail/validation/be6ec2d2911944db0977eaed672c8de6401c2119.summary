the frontrunner to replace @entity1 as @entity2 leader has savaged the way his party has conducted itself in coalition with the @entity6 – saying it deserves just ‘ two out of 10 ’			1
in a thinly - veiled attack on the deputy prime minister , @entity9 said the party should have been much braver and blocked the @entity13 ’ controversial health reforms			1
the mp for @entity16 and @entity17 acknowledged that the party will lose many of his seats at the election – saying he was looking forward to the ‘ thrill of rebuilding ’			1
attack : @entity9 , right , the front - runner to replace @entity1 , left , as @entity2 leader has savaged the way his party conducts itself in the @entity25 – saying it deserves a score of ‘ two out of ten ’ but he said that , despite this fall in parliamentary strength , he would demand the same number of cabinet ministers in any new coalition agreement			1
the arch comments will be seen as the latest stage in mr @entity9 ’s undeclared bid for leadership of the party should it suffer a catastrophe on 7 may			2
the @entity2 won 57 seats at the 2010 election , meaning that when they went into @entity25 with the @entity13 , they were able to argue for five @entity42 places			1
but the polls are so bad now – one even put the @entity2 on 5 per cent – that the party is projected to lose half his seats in may			1
some even expect mr @entity1 to lose his @entity47 seat			0
in an interview with the @entity49 , mr @entity9 said the @entity2 should ‘ actively consider ’ something short of a full coalition if the general election results in a hung parliament			1
he told the paper that he believed the party would hang on to well over half of the 57 seats they won in 2010			2
but he said he was already preparing to pick up the pieces			0
‘ what i ’m absolutely ready for — you may as well be excited by it — is the thrill of rebuilding , ’ he said			0
if mr @entity1 goes after the election , mr @entity9 is seen as the front - runner to succeed him			1
potential rivals such as @entity67 , the business secretary , care minister @entity68 , and @entity69 , the energy secretary , are seen as less likely to win			0
mr @entity9 told the ft that while another coalition is possible , the @entity2 should consider letting @entity72 or @entity73 form a minority government			1
he said the @entity2 believe that while ‘ stable government is absolutely essential ’ , coalition is not the only answer			2
‘ you really have got to be ready to walk away , ’ he said			0
mr @entity9 said the price for any formal deal should be for the @entity2 to take ownership of one particular part of government policy			1
‘ for me it would be infrastructure renewal , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s about the hard development of a kind of @entity90 - style infrastructure revolution ,			0
‘ we ’re talking about @entity93 levels of broadband , 3million new homes — almost all of them affordable — over a 10 - year period			0
’ defence : mr @entity9 insisted that forming the @entity25 had been the ‘ grown - up ’ thing to do and said his party should not be ‘ punished ’			1
above , @entity72 and @entity1 outside no 10 after the 2010 election the former @entity103 president said that if the @entity2 did agree to a coalition , he would expect the party to hold as many ministerial posts as now — even if the party has far fewer mps			1
‘ i ’m not going to give away any ministerial seats without a massive fight , ’ he said			0
while he said the party deserves ‘ eight out of 10 ’ for the way it handled the coalition negotiations in 2010 , he suggested that mr @entity1 should have been more robust with the @entity6 in government			2
‘ you ’re not going to bring the government down on something like the @entity118 reforms if you say no , it ’s not happening , ’ he said			0
mr @entity9 gave the party a score of just ‘ two out of 10 ’ for how it had handled its time in coalition			2
and he said mr @entity1 should have understood the damage the party ’s u-turn on tuition fees would inflict			0
but he insisted the party was right to go into coalition at a time of national economic emergency in 2010 and says it would be regrettable if the party was now ‘ punished for it ’			2
he said the @entity128 @entity105 , the @entity129 and the @entity130 might draw the conclusion that voters did not reward parties that ‘ behaved like a grown up ’			0
he adds : ‘ if that is the message that ’s communicated — that parties that behave in a decent way get hammered for it — that is a great worry			0

@entity9 said @entity2 should have blocked the @entity6 ' health reforms
the mp also acknowledged the party could lose seats at the election
but he insisted that forming the @entity25 had been ' grown - up ' thing to do
