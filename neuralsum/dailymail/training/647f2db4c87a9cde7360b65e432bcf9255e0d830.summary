by @entity0 one of the biggest @entity2 pyramids in @entity3 has been all but destroyed by ' ignorant ' builders who ravaged the ancient structure for crushed rock to fill in a new road			1
the construction workers used bulldozers and diggers to claw at the sloping sides of the 100ft tall pyramid , which is part of the @entity14 complex - the most important @entity2 site in northern @entity3 and one which dates back at least 2,300 years			1
horrified archaeologists claim there is no way the builders could have mistaken the @entity2 ruins for a hill , as the landscape is naturally flat and the @entity14 complex is well known			1
' obscene ' : a construction company used bulldozers and diggers to claw into an ancient @entity2 pyramid in @entity3 and extract crushed rock to use as roadfill ' disbelief ' : archaeologists in @entity3 said learning of the destruction of the ruin was ' like being punched in the stomach ' @entity34 , head of the @entity35 , said the destruction at the @entity14 complex in northern @entity3 was detected late last week			1
' it 's a feeling of @entity41 disbelief because of the ignorance and the insensitivity ... they were using this for road fill , ' mr @entity34 said			1
' it 's like being punched in the stomach , it 's just so horrendous			2
' @entity14 sat in the middle of a privately owned sugar cane field , and lacked the even stone sides frequently seen in reconstructed or better - preserved pyramids			2
nonetheless mr @entity34 is certain the builders could not have mistaken the pyramid mound for anything other than @entity2 ruins			1
' ignorance and insensitivity ' : horrified archaelogists say there is no way the construction workers could have mistaken the 100ft tall ruins for a natural hill historic : the ancient structure was part of the @entity14 complex in northern @entity3 ' these guys knew that this was an ancient structure			1
it 's just bloody laziness , ' he said			0
the builders used backhoes to claw at the sides of the pyramid , leaving an isolated core of limestone cobbles at the centre , with what appears to be a narrow @entity2 chamber dangling above one hollowed - out section			1
fragments : police in @entity3 are investigating and criminal charges may be brought against the construction firm ' just to realize that the ancient @entity87 acquired all this building material to erect these buildings , using nothing more than stone tools and quarried the stone , and carried this material on their heads , using tump lines , ' said the archaeologist			1
' to think that today we have modern equipment , that you can go and excavate in a quarry anywhere , but that this company would completely disregard that and completely destroyed this building			0
why ca n't these people just go and quarry somewhere that has no cultural significance ? it 's mind - boggling			0
' @entity3 police said they are conducting an investigation and that criminal charges may be brought against the construction company			1
the @entity14 complex sits on private land , but @entity3 law says that any @entity119 ruins are under government protection			1
the @entity3 community - action group @entity121 called the destruction of the archaeological site ' an obscene example of disrespect for the environment and history '			2
it is not the first time it 's happened in @entity3 , a country of about 350,000 people that is largely covered in jungle and dotted with hundreds of @entity2 ruin sites - though few as large as @entity14			1
@entity134 , an emeritus professor of archaeology at @entity136 who worked in @entity3 research projects in the 1980s , said it was far from the first time @entity2 mounds had been targeted by construction workers seeking materials			1
he wrote in an email that ' bulldozing @entity139 for road fill is an endemic problem in @entity3 ( the whole of the @entity147 center has gone , both of the major pyramids at @entity150 , other structures at @entity14 , many smaller sites ) , but this sounds like the biggest yet '			1
heritage : @entity3 is dotted with hundreds of ruin sites dating back to the time of the ancient @entity155 @entity156 , chairman of the @entity157 at the @entity158 , said : ' archaeologists are disturbed when such things occur , but there is only a very limited infrastructure in @entity3 that can be applied to cultural heritage management			1
' unfortunately , they ( destruction of sites ) are all too common , but not usually in the center of a large @entity87 site , ' he said			0
he said there had probably still been much to learn from the site			0
' a great deal of archaeology was undertaken at @entity14 in the ` 70s and ` 80s , but this only sampled a small part of this large center			1
' @entity3 is n't the only place where the handiwork of the far - flung and enormously prolific @entity87 builders is being destroyed			2
dominance : the @entity155 covered all of the @entity182 and modern day @entity184 and @entity3 , along with parts of @entity186 ( pictured ) , @entity187 and @entity188 the ancient @entity155 spread across southeastern @entity186 and through @entity184 , @entity187 and @entity3			2
' i do n't think i am exaggerating if i say that every day a @entity87 mound is being destroyed for construction in one of the countries where the @entity87 lived , ' wrote @entity194 , a professor at @entity196 's @entity195			2
' unfortunately , this destruction of our heritage is irreversible but many do n't take it seriously , ' he added			0
' the only way to stop it is by showing that it is a major crime and people can and will go to jail for it			0
' @entity207 , an archaeologist at the @entity208 at @entity209 , described the difficult and heartbreaking work of trying to salvage information at the nearby site of @entity147 following similar destruction around 2005			2
' bulldozing damage at @entity147 is extensive and the site is littered with classic period potsherds , ' he wrote in an academic paper describing the scene			2
' we spent a number of days at the beginning of the 2005 season trying to figure out the extent of the damage ...			0
after scratching our heads for many days , a bulldozer showed up and we realized that what appear to be mounds , when overgrown with chest - high vegetation , are actually recently bulldozed garbage piles			0
' however small the compensation , bulldozing pyramids is one very brutal way of revealing the inner cores of the structures , which were often built up in periodic stages of construction			2
" the one advantage of this massive destruction , to the core site , is that the remains of early domestic activity are now visible on the surface , ' mr @entity207 wrote			0
@entity3 , which shares its rich @entity2 heritage with neighbouring @entity184 , @entity186 and @entity187 , is regarded as the heart of the civilisation during the classic period of 250ad to 900ad			1
it was during this period - the golden age of the empire - that the @entity87 built the great stone cities and monuments that have captured the imagination of explorers and scholars for centuries			0
@entity255 grew to some 40 cities , and it is thought that the population may have grown to reach two million people at its peak			0
archaeologists excavating @entity87 sites have uncovered plazas and temples , palaces and pyramids			0
the heart of @entity267 : a @entity2 temple in @entity269 , in the @entity270 of western @entity3 many @entity267 temples and palaces were constructed in a stepped pyramid shape , and engraved with elaborate artworks and inscriptions			1
the @entity87 placed temple - pyramids at the heart of their great stone cities			0
one of the best known - the @entity280 at @entity281 in @entity186 - was a monument to the 7th century king @entity283			0
another famous @entity87 structure is the @entity285 at @entity286 , @entity186			0
according to @entity87 legend , the pyramid was built by @entity289 , god of magic , as a training centre for shamans and healers			0
maya structures give clues to the importance the civilisation placed on its complex astronomical and cosmological system , with many pyramids deliberately angled to face sunrise or sunset at particular times of the year .			0
