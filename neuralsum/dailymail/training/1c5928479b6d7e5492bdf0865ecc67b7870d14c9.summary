@entity0 relished his reputation as ' @entity3 's answer to @entity4 ' and would happily regale anyone in ear shot with stories of murder , mutilation , rape and cannibalism			1
his tales of how he strangled , stabbed , defiled and mutilated more than 30 victims over three decades , captivated and horrified his homeland in equal measure , cementing his standing as the country 's most prolific and deranged serial killer			1
but then , 23 years after he was locked up in a remote psychiatric hospital , he made his most staggering confession of all : that he had made it all up			2
and yesterday all charges against the 63 - year - old were dropped , in a legal first that has cast a dark shadow over @entity3 's judicial system			1
how was he convicted ? yesterday , 23 years after he was locked up in @entity3 's most secure psychiatric hospital , all charges against the 63 - year - old were dropped , in a legal first that has cast a shadow over @entity3 's judicial process unexplained : @entity0 claimed he killed 17 - year - old @entity34 @entity33 , left , in 1981 , and strangled female prostitute @entity35 , right , in 1985 ' i 've killed ' : it was during a series of therapy sessions in the psychiatric hospital that he realised for the first time how to make people sit up and take an interest in him psychiatric officials will now evaluate whether @entity0 can be released from the secure mental health unit where he 's been held since 1991			1
of the 30 murders @entity0 confessed to , he was convicted of eight			1
but he later said he had lied to investigators because he craved attention and was heavily medicated			1
his claimed victims were all of different ages , different sexes and from different backgrounds			1
some he claimed he stabbed , others he strangled and one he beat to death with a rock			2
some he said he raped , others he chopped up and one he even claimed to have eaten			2
but what was constant throughout all his gruesome confessions was the detail with which he described the murders : how he killed them , where he killed them , even their last words			1
faces of a serial killer ? @entity0 relished telling the world how he strangled , stabbed , defiled and mutilated more than 30 victims over three decades , thus cementing his reputation as the country 's most prolific and deranged serial killer 1976 , @entity75 , 15 he claimed to have picked the teenager up in his car by the side of a road			1
after persuading him to engage in a sexual act he said he strangled him , abused the body and cut it up with a saw in nearby woods			2
he said he took a leg as a souvenir			2
1980 , @entity88 , 11 he spotted @entity89 by the side of a road and asked to check if he had run over a cat			2
when the boy bent over he smashed his head against the door and dragged him into his car			2
he drove the boy into the countryside , where he sexually assaulted then strangled him			2
he buried some of the organs , put the hands on the car 's front seat , the head , legs and torso in plastic bags			2
he said what he did n't throw out of the window he took home and ate			1
1981 , @entity33 , 17 after beating and raping her he said he strangled her with the strap of her handbag 1984 , @entity111 and @entity112 the @entity114 couple were on a camping holiday			2
he said he stabbed the husband through the tent canvas and clambered inside			2
he described the attack in extraordinary detail , accurately numbering hoa many times each victim was stabbed			0
1985 , @entity123 , 23 he made the @entity34 female prostitute strip before he tortured her , and he described how she vomited as he strangled her			0
1988 , @entity126 student , @entity125 , 24 he said he and an accomplice took the tourists , who was seeing relatives , to a holiday home in the woods and killed him when he tried to escape			0
1988 , @entity133 , nine the @entity34 girl was waiting at a bus shelter for a downpour to end when he pulled her down a slope and bashed her head against a rock			0
he later told how disappointed he was that she was not a boy			0
he said her last words were : mummy , mummy			0
' he then dismembered and buried her , returning a year later to burn the remains			0
police later found a bone fragment that matched that of a young girl that appeared to have been cut by a sharp instrument in the spot he identified			0
he managed to hoodwink judges , psychiatrists , journalists and the @entity3 public			0
until in 1998 he decided enough was enough			0
' i had burned so many bridges [ in my life ] , and i was plunged into this profound loneliness , ' he told @entity164			0
' i wanted to be this interesting person			0
i did nâ€™t want to be this gray bad person			0
i wanted to be something else			0
' his near forensic knowledge of many of the murders convinced detectives and prosecutors that he must have committed the crimes			1
nobody bothered to find out that he had studied the killings during regular trips to a local library on day trips from the asylum			0
@entity0 , a convicted sex offender and bank robber who at the time had changed his name to @entity0 , had already been locked up in the @entity186 hospital for a botched bank robbery			1
it was there , during a series of therapy sessions which he says were so uninteresting that he felt a failure even at that , that he realised for the first time how to make people sit up and take notice of him			0
he told @entity164 how his heavily - pregnant mother had walked in on his father sexually abusing him at the age of ten , the therapist 's interest seemed to spark up			0
such was the shock at what his mother had seen , he claimed , that she miscarried the baby onto the bedroom floor			0
he told how the next day his father took him to bury the dead foetus in nearby woodland			0
as the therapist listened intently to his tale , for the first time he felt important			0
and within weeks he was telling staff he was behind one of @entity3 's most famous unsolved murders - that of 11 - year - old @entity88 whose torso alone was found in 1980			1
as the months drew on he confessed to a host of other murders including that of a 15 - year - old boy in 1976 ; a 17 - year - old girl in 1981 ; @entity114 husband and wife in 1984 ; a 23 - year - old female prostitute in 1985 ; and an @entity126 student and a 9 - year - old @entity34 girl in 1988			1
of those eight murders he was convicted , despite claims of a lack of real evidence			1
retrials were ordered in each case , but prosecutors said that without the confessions they did n't have enough evidence to go back to court			0
on wednesday they dropped the final case , which involved the death of 15 - year - old boy who disappeared in northern @entity3 in 1976			2
@entity0 was convicted in 1994 of murdering the boy , even though there was no technical evidence linking him to the crime and the cause of death could not be established			1
the lack of evidence to support the confessions led to some doubts over @entity0 's guilt , but a 2006 review by @entity3 's chancellor of justice found no problems with the convictions			1
two years later @entity0 recanted in a @entity3 tv documentary , saying he had fabricated the story of @entity0 the serial killer			1
he now claims it was a cry for attention , fueled by heavy medication			1
in hospital : @entity0 , a convicted sex offender and bank robber who at the time had changed his name to @entity0 , had already been locked up in the @entity186 hospital for a botched bank robbery ' if i had n't accepted therapy and benzodiazepines , no @entity0 would have been created , ' @entity0 told @entity268 ' in that lies the guilt that i must carry to my grave with respect to the relatives of the victims , their suffering during the @entity0 years			1
' ' that a person has been convicted of eight murders and later been declared innocent , that is unique in @entity3 legal history , ' attorney general @entity275 told reporters in @entity281			1
' it has to be considered as a big failure for the justice system			0
' by telephone from the @entity186 psychiatric unit , @entity0 called the decision to drop the final charges ' overwhelming and emotional , ' and called for an investigation into how the justice system has handled his case			1
' the next step is that i , with my lawyers , take actions for my release , ' he told @entity268			0
@entity297 , a @entity3 legal expert who was not involved with the case , called it @entity3 's ' greatest miscarriage of justice in modern times			0
' he said it was particularly painful for the families of the victims , who are unlikely to ever find out the truth of what happened to their loved ones			2
with @entity0 's confessions withdrawn , there are no longer any strong links between the eight deaths , and it 's not even clear that all were homicides			1
in two cases no bodies were found			0
