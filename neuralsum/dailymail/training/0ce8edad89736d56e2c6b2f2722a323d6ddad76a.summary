by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:51 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 01:43 est , 14 june 2013 @entity3 outgoing chief @entity2 was removed in a ' coup ' staged by @entity5 @entity7 ’s new boss will be ordered to lend billions more to struggling businesses after @entity5 staged a ‘ coup ’ to remove its chief executive @entity2			1
a day after mr @entity2 ’s departure was announced , the troubled banking giant was the biggest faller on the @entity15 , initially losing more than 6 per cent of its value in early trading			1
shares rallied later but £ 650million was wiped off the value of the bank , which is 81 per cent owned by the taxpayer , following @entity5 ’s political gamble			1
city concern was intensified by speculation the bank ’s chairman , sir @entity25 , could follow mr @entity2 through the exit door next year			1
the @entity28 denied @entity29 claims that mr @entity2 had been removed to pave the way for a pre-election ‘ fire sale ’ of @entity3 , which received a £ 45billion taxpayer bailout			1
but ministers did make it clear the new regime at @entity3 would be expected to increase lending to @entity38 ’s small businesses			1
treasury minister @entity39 told @entity40 that small business lending would become ‘ even more prominent in @entity3 ’s strategy ’			1
last night @entity43 told the financial website @entity45 that voters were more interested in getting their money back than a quick return to the private sector			0
‘ it will take time , because this is a bank that is still healing , ’ the prime minister said			0
‘ as for when we get it back into the private sector , i just have two very simple concerns – one is we must make sure this bank contributes to the recovery of the @entity38 economy			0
' secondly , people put their money in			0
i want them to get their money out			0
’ a total of £ 650million was wiped off the value of @entity3 after @entity5 's political gamble @entity67 ( pictured with @entity5 ) launched an attack on @entity3 's lending record what happens now to @entity3 ? @entity5 believes it is time for @entity3 to move from the ‘ rescue phase ’ to the ‘ next stage ’			1
this means preparing the bank for a return to the private sector and making it lend more to business to boost the economy			2
the future for both @entity3 and @entity81 will be made clear next week when the chancellor gives his annual speech at @entity84 in @entity85 on the state of the economy			2
what are the privatisation options ? one is to test the market in the near future by selling off a tranche of @entity3 shares to taxpayers – similar to the ‘ @entity96 ’ privatisation of @entity95 in the 1980s			2
another option is to divide @entity3 before privatisation			2
it would be split into a ‘ good bank ’ , which would lend to businesses and households and a ‘ bad bank ’ which would contain all the toxic assets , and dispose of them separately			1
this proposal is supported by several members of the @entity107 , including archbishop of canterbury @entity108 and former chancellor @entity110			0
what does the chancellor think ? mr @entity5 has made it clear in the past that he is opposed to splitting the bank in two , as it would be expensive , time - consuming and complex			1
but some believe he may warm to the idea if its forces @entity3 to lend more			1
will taxpayers get their money back ? this is the big question			0
taxpayers are currently sitting on a £ 17billion loss on their 81 per cent stake in @entity3			2
they may yet get the bulk of their money back but there is growing speculation the @entity128 is softening up the public to sell shares at a loss , pinning the blame on the last @entity29 government for paying too much for its stake in @entity3 and @entity81 when they were bailed out during the financial crisis			2
@entity3 has indicated it wants to start selling off shares by the end of next year			2
but @entity28 insiders are now insisting there is ‘ no rush ’			0
earlier this week business secretary @entity67 launched an attack on the bank ’s lending record , saying entrepreneurs were becoming even ‘ angrier ’ at the lack of available credit			0
@entity3 remains @entity38 ’s biggest business lender			0
but despite pressure from ministers , the bank ’s net lending has fallen by £ 4billion in the last 12 months			2
mr @entity67 said the economy was being held back by ‘ this highly centralised , dysfunctional banking structure ’			0
mr @entity2 yesterday defended @entity3 ’s lending record , saying the bank had done a ‘ terrific job ’ and was ‘ pulling its weight ’ on lending			1
the major banks insist they are willing to lend and warn that using credit to prop up unviable firms will end in trouble			0
but the chancellor is understood to have come round to the viewpoint of mr cable , who has long seen the refusal of the banks to lend as a major barrier to economic growth			0
the @entity171 is also expected to call for @entity3 and other major banks to increase their small business lending when it publishes its long - awaited report on the future of the industry next week			1
speaking in the @entity179 , the @entity107 ’s @entity178 chairman @entity177 said : ‘ they need an @entity3 that is fully functioning for the first time in many years			0
’ mr @entity39 said mr @entity5 had not been ‘ directly involved ’ in meeting mr @entity2 to discuss his removal			1
but mr @entity2 did not deny speculation the two men did not get on , revealing they had not spoken for three months			0
@entity185 , the former @entity186 minister , told the @entity187 mr @entity5 had made mr @entity2 ’s position ‘ close to impossible ’ and that the board – dominated by @entity192 , which manages the government ’s shareholding – was ‘ doing the bidding ’ of the chancellor			1
mr @entity2 , who will leave at the end of this year with a pay - off worth up to £ 5.6million , was widely praised for bringing @entity3 back from the brink of collapse			1
@entity3 yesterday confirmed it was shedding 2,000 jobs from its investment banking arm .			0
