@entity1 customers threatened to boycott the store last night for allowing @entity4 checkout staff to refuse to serve customers who want to pay for alcohol or pork			1
managers at a @entity11 store told the workers they could ask any shoppers trying to buy the items to wait until a different till was available , it emerged yesterday			1
one shopper said : ' i had one bottle of champagne , and the lady , who was wearing a headscarf , was very apologetic but said she could not serve me			0
she told me to wait until another member of staff was available			2
policy : @entity25 has told @entity4 staff they can refuse to serve shoppers buying alcohol or pork wait : instead , shoppers are being asked to wait to pay for goods like alcohol at a different till ( file picture ) ' i was taken aback			1
i 've never come across that before			0
' last night , @entity25 said the advice had been given in error and was not consistent with its national policy			1
but customers bombarded the store 's @entity40 page to complain , while another site was set up calling on shoppers to boycott @entity1			2
more than 1,500 others put posts on @entity46			0
customer @entity47 wrote : ' if you have @entity50 workers who wish to refuse the sale of ladies ' garments to male homosexuals or men 's trousers to lesbians , i do hope you will stand by those workers ' religious or personal beliefs			1
' my family and i shall no longer purchase any goods from your company due to the implementation of this “ one rule system ” that creates further division and hatred within our communities			0
' decision : the chain said the policy of tolerance acknowledges the beliefs of other religious workers @entity76 posted : ' if @entity1 go ahead with this they are going to lose so many loyal customers			1
' if they do not want to serve people with pork or alcohol they should n't work in the food hall			2
simple ! ' @entity85 posted on the store 's @entity40 page : ' i sha n't be shopping in @entity1 any more			0
the quintessentially @entity90 retailer bows down to @entity4 beliefs			2
and in turn alienates the majority of @entity50 and non-religious customers			0
' contrast : however , @entity96 's has issued guidelines stating that all staff members must be treated ' fairly ' ' no sense ' : meanwhile , @entity100 said it ' would make no sense ' to employ staff who refused to touch specific items @entity96 's guidelines state there is no reason why staff who do not drink alcohol or eat pork for religious reasons can not handle them			1
@entity100 said it made no sense to put staff on a till if they refused to touch certain items for religious reasons			1
@entity116 said it would not deploy any @entity117 on tills who objected to handling alcohol , while @entity120 , which is based in @entity121 where there is a large @entity4 community , said it would ' respect anyone 's wishes not to handle products for religious or cultural reasons '			1
dr @entity128 , the former @entity129 , said : ' if supermarkets do not put up a notice saying “ this desk does not handle alcoholic beverages ” , shoppers could be humiliated when they get to the checkout			0
' an @entity1 spokesman said : ' customer service is our priority			0
where we have an employee whose religious beliefs restrict food or drink they can handle , we work closely with our member of staff to place them in a suitable role , such as in our clothing department or bakery			1
' we regret that in the case highlighted today we were not following our own policy			0
' as a secular business we have an inclusive policy that welcomes all religious beliefs			2
' this policy has been in place for many years , and when followed correctly , we do not believe that it should compromise our ability to offer the highest level of customer service			0
we apologise that this policy was not followed in the case reported			0

@entity25 's policy applies to @entity4 staff in more than *700* stores
shoppers are being asked to wait to pay for certain items at different till
highlights divide among *mainstream* food retailers over religious workers
