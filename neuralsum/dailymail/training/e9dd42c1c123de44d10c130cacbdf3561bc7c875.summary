by @entity0 and @entity1 glitz , glamour and the popemobile have been shunned by the notoriously frugal @entity5 , who has revealed he will now drive a 1984 @entity6 4			1
the clunky five - seater is a throwback to the pontiff 's old car in his native @entity11			1

@entity5 ( right ) speaks with car owner rev. @entity19 ( second from right ) , his assistant @entity21 , and two assistants after he was given the @entity23 on wednesday rev @entity19 calls the 29 - year - old banger a ' @entity28 farmers ' car			1
it is like the one pope @entity5 had in @entity11 pope @entity30 - and @entity35 security - preferred the bullet - proof @entity32 popemobile to this rusty ride the second - hand @entity6 was a present from @entity39 , a priest from @entity40 , who used it to drive children to play groups			1
he handed it to @entity5 at an informal event yesterday			1
@entity46 refers to the old banger , which has 190,000 miles on the clock , as ' the car of @entity28 farmers '			2
and news has emerged that the @entity35 is not impressed by the gift			2
rev. @entity19 told @entity54 magazine @entity53 : ' the security guard standing next to me was really worried because he knew that from now on he ’ll be going around the @entity35 in my car			1
' it is not the first stir @entity5 has caused since he was chosen to serve in february			1
atheists wo n’t face eternal damnation after all , he declared yesterday , as long as they are morally upstanding			0
in an extraordinary open letter , @entity5 indicated that well - behaved non believers are not in fact committing a sin			1
pope @entity5 recently stunned journalists when he said homosexuals should not be judged he wrote : ‘ what matters for those who do n’t believe is to follow their conscience			1
‘ @entity73 only happens when those who do n’t have faith go against their conscience			0
’ the letter , published in the @entity54 newspaper @entity77 , was responding to a question posed in an editorial by the paper in july			2
' will @entity82 forgive those who do not believe in him ? ' it asked			0
the pontiff ’s seemingly softened line on atheists is at odds with catholic doctrine stating that only believers will be saved			0
earlier this year @entity35 spokesman @entity90 insisted ‘ all salvation comes from @entity92 , the @entity93 , through the church which is his body			0
quoting from doctrine in the @entity97 , he said : ‘ hence they can not be saved who , knowing the @entity94 as founded by @entity92 and necessary for salvation , would refuse to enter her or remain in her			0
since his appointment in april @entity5 has repeatedly reached out to non-believers			2
on @entity103 he washed the feet of a @entity106 woman in a juvenile detention centre			0

the u-turn comes as the @entity5 ’s new deputy signalled that the @entity35 could also be softening its stance towards married priests			2
professor @entity115 has regularly spoken out against religion and is a prominent atheist incoming secretary of state @entity118 told @entity120 newspaper @entity119 that the tradition of priestly ' celibacy is not dogma ' , or a law of divine origin , and is therefore open to discussion			0
