@entity0 says that @entity1 was sold to @entity2 because he was not good enough for @entity3 but denies that the club have ditched their vaunted youth policy			1
@entity3 ’s £ 150million summer spend on six new players , including @entity7 and @entity8 , has led to concerns that they are turning their back on homegrown talent – especially after @entity12 striker @entity1 was sold to @entity2 for £ 16m			1
but at a press conference to unveil @entity8 and @entity15 on thursday , @entity13 claimed that @entity3 remain as committed as ever to promoting young players			1
‘ i have given all the players a chance to convince me of their qualities , ’ said @entity13			1
‘ when you ask about @entity1 , he was here since the age of nine and after @entity47 ( on loan ) he played three seasons at @entity3 but he does n’t have the record of @entity50 or @entity38 and that ’s the standard			1
that ’s why we let him go			0
‘ @entity8 , okay , but also the youngsters who will fit in			1
that ’s the policy and that ’s why i ’m here			0
the transformation is in this new process			0
‘ we spoke with @entity1 and also @entity60 [ @entity60 ] before we got the chance to sign @entity8			1
we have to be fair about that			0
in that part ( area of the team ) we had a lot of youth who can fit in			0
they have to take their chance to play football			0
i have to put them in the squad			0
’ @entity0 says @entity1 's record is n't as good as that of @entity38 and @entity39 @entity39 and @entity38 are the standard for @entity3 , says @entity13 former @entity3 favourites @entity76 and @entity78 have questioned @entity3 ’s transfer policy , while sir @entity82 ’s former no 2 @entity80 has claimed that the club are losing their ‘ identity ’ by selling @entity1			1
i ca n’t work it out and i know i worked with @entity1 last week [ with @entity12 ] , but it ’s odd , ' @entity76 said			1
' i have to admit i thought the @entity1 sale was a strange one , but that ’s just me			1
‘ of all the prices paid this summer , there are right backs and left - backs galore who have been bought for £ 14m , £ 15m , £ 16m ? ‘ how have @entity2 got him [ @entity1 ] for £ 16m ? i ca n’t work it out			1
it has helped out a competitor because @entity2 are the team they are fighting for fourth possibly			2
‘ i am struggling to work out the logic , i ca n’t understand it			0
it ’s odd in two or three ways			0
but @entity13 was quick to point out that having let 14 players go this summer and signed six , @entity3 have created the possibility of eight vacancies for young players at the club			1
@entity107 will be in contention for @entity1 ’s place and @entity110 and @entity111 have made the first - team debuts already this season			1
@entity1 scores the second goal for @entity12 in his @entity116 qualifier brace against @entity117 now at @entity118 , @entity60 was surplus to requirements in @entity0 's @entity3 @entity60 is put through his paces at @entity118 's training ground at @entity122 @entity3 boss @entity0 ( centre ) with @entity8 ( left ) and @entity15 ( right ) he added : ‘ we let go 14 players so how to fit them all is n’t so difficult when you let go 14 and only six come in			1
we need the youth education , that is the policy of @entity3 also			2
‘ i am always willing to give players chances but they have to take them			2
i ca n’t do that for them			0
the possibility is there and all the youngsters have to know that			0
@entity3 have come to me because of that			2
‘ there is a new hierarchy in the dressing - room so there is a new process			2
it ’s not so easy , and that ’s why i have asked for time because i knew in advance that this would happen			0
‘ when you do n’t let go of players to other clubs then you never allow to give youth players a chance			2
because of this policy , we will give youth players a chance			2
‘ the question is if they take the chance			0
it ’s of course more risky but it ’s the only way to do it , and @entity3 have always grown players in the squad			1
@entity107 could be in contention for @entity1 's place , but has some superstars to contend with @entity110 ( left ) and @entity111 ( right ) have made first - team debuts for @entity3 this campaign new signing @entity8 trains ahead of a likely @entity3 debut against @entity168 @entity169 wants long - term @entity3 stay ‘ i hope so because they have to perform our philosophy , and that is not so easy to perform			1
you have seen that already			0
‘ i think the players we have selected will do that better , otherwise we would n’t have to buy these players			2
’ @entity13 paid tribute to @entity8 and described how the @entity183 striker – who could cost @entity3 a total of £ 52m if they make his £ 6m loan from @entity186 permanent next summer – had demonstrated his class in his very first training session at @entity189			1
‘ when you can hire or buy a player like @entity8 then i do n’t have doubts because he is for me one of the best strikers in the world			2
when you see his record it ’s unbelievable			0
‘ today at training he got one ball and it was in the goal			0
he confirmed it in his first training session with me			0
when i say that i put too much pressure on him and that ’s not good			0
