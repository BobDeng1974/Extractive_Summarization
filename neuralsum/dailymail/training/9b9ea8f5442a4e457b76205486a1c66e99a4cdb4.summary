a group of businessmen and retired mandarins are waging a behind - the - scenes propaganda war aimed at derailing moves to take @entity6 out of the @entity7			1
appalled by the prospect of a vote to withdraw , they have formed ‘ @entity13 ’ to fight a public and private campaign to keep @entity6 in the union			1
they are raising a multi-million - pound war chest to secure support from international leaders in the run - up to the vote which they now suspect is inevitable			1
campaign : a group of businessmen and retired mandarins are waging a propaganda war aimed at derailing moves to take @entity6 out of the @entity7			1
@entity25 , right , pictured with lord @entity26 , is the driving force behind the group they are lobbying world leaders to go public with warnings that @entity6 will become isolated economically and politically if it votes to quit the @entity7			2
they hope if enough of them speak out @entity6 voters will take fright and vote to stay shackled to @entity35			1
@entity36 has promised a renegotiation of @entity6 membership of the @entity7 if the @entity39 win the 2015 general election , followed by a referendum two years later			2
it will be the first national vote on @entity6 ’s membership of the @entity7 since 1975 , with the latest @entity45 poll suggesting the number who want to leave comfortably outnumber those who want to stay by 43 per cent to 35 per cent			1
@entity25 , an arch networker and lobbyist who runs the successful @entity52 pr company @entity52 , is the driving force behind the group			2
he is a confidante of @entity54 , @entity26 , the former cabinet minister and @entity56 , and @entity57 , @entity58 ’s last foreign secretary			0
pledge : @entity36 has promised a renegotiation of @entity6 membership of the @entity7 if the @entity39 win the 2015 general election , followed by a referendum two years later they are intensifying their pr drive after heavyweight @entity39 eurosceptics including education secretary @entity64 indicated they would vote to quit the @entity7			1
in the past week the diplomatic offensive has intensified			0
the @entity67 foreign minister @entity66 , in a letter to the foreign secretary @entity69 , said : ‘ @entity67 recognises the @entity6 ’s strength and resilience and looks forward to seeing it continue as a leading economy and effective power			1
strong active membership of the @entity7 contributes to this			0
’ two days earlier a leaked memo from the @entity78 government submitted to mr @entity69 warned that up to 1,300 @entity78 firms with @entity6 outlets could review their position if @entity6 does not continue to play a ‘ major role ’ in the @entity7			1
@entity13 does not claim to have prompted the @entity67 or @entity78 comments , but its supporters are talking openly of similar interventions in the coming weeks from @entity86 and @entity87 , fuelling the suspicion that it is co-ordinating international and domestic opposition to the @entity36 plan			1
one of prince @entity69 ’s key advisers also warned this week that leaving the @entity7 would make @entity6 ‘ an irrelevance ’ on the world stage			1
sir @entity94 , a former @entity6 ambassador to @entity95 who was complicit in the secret deal between @entity54 and @entity97 to go to war in @entity99 , is not a member of the group , but is known to be sympathetic with its aims			1

as part of the ongoing behind - the - scenes efforts mr @entity25 led delegations to meet the @entity117 foreign and economic minsters in @entity118 and their counterparts in the @entity121 government in @entity122 at the end of last year			1
similar trips are scheduled for @entity125 and the @entity126 after @entity128 ’s elections in september			0
the pro-eu lobbyists ’ offensive coincides with a raft of economic figures which show that @entity6 could actually prosper outside the failing eurozone			1
only this week statistics showed that @entity6 attracted more investment from overseas than any other @entity7 country last year			0
the number of foreign investment projects rose by 11 per cent to 1,559 , according to a report by @entity140			0
want out : a poll suggests the number of @entity6 who want to leave the @entity7 comfortably outnumber those who want to stay by 43 per cent to 35 per cent the funding created or safeguarded 170,000 @entity6 jobs , a further sign that @entity6 is extending its lead over rivals in the eurozone			0
a report by the @entity151 showed that every land mass in the world is now expanding economically except @entity154			0
the @entity155 is growing at 7.2 per cent , while the eurozone is shrinking			0
a report by the @entity157 showed that exports to the @entity7 are now at their lowest proportion of @entity6 ’s overall trade since the present measure was introduced in 1988			0
despite the plethora of positive figures there has been evidence in the past two months that the covert campaign by mr @entity25 is paying rich dividends			2
in may president @entity170 , speaking at a @entity169 press conference , infuriated @entity39 mps by saying : ‘ i think that the @entity6 ’s participation in the @entity7 is an expression of its influence and its role in the world			2
’ it is no coincidence that one of the most senior backers of the @entity25 group is sir @entity182 , a director of @entity183 , who is an ardent europhile			2
he was @entity6 ambassador to the @entity7 from 2000 to 2003 and ambassador to the @entity186 from 2007 until last year			0
he is a hugely respected figure in the @entity188			0
‘ the @entity190 were the first big coup for @entity25 and his group , ’ said one senior government source			1
mr @entity54 and @entity26 , while not members of @entity13 , travel extensively overseas using their contacts in foreign governments to urge them to speak against @entity6 pulling out			1

@entity205 , the leading eurosceptic @entity206 , said : ‘ why should we take their predictions seriously ? ' mr @entity25 and his supporters all warned us we would be doomed if we did not join the euro			2
