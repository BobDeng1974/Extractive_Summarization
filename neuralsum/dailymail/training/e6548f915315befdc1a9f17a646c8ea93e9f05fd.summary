culture secretary @entity1 unveiled plans for a @entity10 to approve a new system of watchdogs in response to the @entity14 into press standards			2
under the scheme , the newspaper and magazine industry will set up a regulator to give victims of press intrusion a quick and inexpensive system of seeking redress			0
publishers who sign up will face fines of up to £ 1million if they break the rules			1
but under the @entity29 proposals those who fail to sign up – including bloggers or those who publish news online – could face far larger exemplary damages			2
newspaper lawyers say this breaches @entity38 law			0
the @entity10 will create a ‘ recognition panel ’ to decide every three years if the regulator has fulfilled requirements set out by @entity42			1
all three main party leaders would have to agree the proposals to recommend them to the @entity45 who would pass them for approval by the @entity48			0
crucially , the plans mean there would not have to be new press laws , which critics say would undermine freedom of speech			2
culture secretary @entity1 said : ‘ the @entity10 would allow the principles of @entity42 to be implemented swiftly and in a practical fashion			1
it would see the toughest press regulation this country has ever seen , without compromising press freedom			0
’ the plans was welcomed by the industry and the @entity62 but both raised concerns on details			1
@entity66 complained the proposals did ‘ not comply ’ with standards laid down by @entity42 and said they would seek to change them when cross-party talks on the proposals begin again tomorrow			1

any changes must be approved by party leaders and a two - thirds majority in both houses of @entity78			0

she said : ‘ at the heart of @entity42 ’s proposals was that a new system should be independent of politicians and independent of the @entity87			1
there is nothing to stop the @entity45 from amending the @entity10 at any time , thereby changing the terms of the recognition and regulatory framework			0
’ industry representatives said the plans do not go far enough to safeguard @entity96 judge @entity95 , chairman of the appointments committee , would pick @entity87 representative on the recognition panel			1
the rules exclude serving editors and publishers			2
the plans also ban anyone who has ever been an editor from serving on the recognition panel			0
this has raised concerns that the panel will lack the necessary expertise			0
@entity110 , chair of the @entity111 and @entity112 , welcomed ‘ this very constructive announcement ’			2
he said the regulatory body should be set up ‘ without statute , which would raise dangerous constitutional questions ’			2
he added : ‘ we remain opposed to exemplary damages , which are unnecessary , unjust and against @entity38 law , and we have grave reservations about the proposed arrangements for appointments to the @entity123			0
‘ however these are issues which can be addressed over the coming days : the newspaper and magazine industry are determined to have a new , @entity42 - recommended regulatory system up and running as soon as possible			1
’ a @entity62 spokesman said : ‘ the onus is now clearly on those who oppose statute to demonstrate a @entity10 approach can be shown to meet the requirements set out by @entity42			1
