by @entity0 a mass grave has been uncovered underneath @entity4 ’s world famous @entity2			1
in a discovery worthy of a @entity8 novel , more than sixty skeletons have so far been unearthed , laid out head - to - toe , while archeologists believe that hundreds or thousands more may yet emerge			2
the grave , which is thought to date back to the fourth or fifth century , a dark period in @entity4 history when the city was in decline , was only discovered when construction workers began digging a new lift - shaft for the museum			1
a mass grave has been uncovered underneath @entity4 's world famous @entity2 the crypt of corpses sits below the library of the celebrated museum , home to masterpieces such as @entity29 's @entity29 's @entity28 and visited by millions of @entity30 every year			1
archeologists say the bodies bear no clear sign of malnutrition or violence , leading experts to believe they may have been victims of an early plague			2
soil samples indicate that they were buried simultaneously in groups of four or five with the bones of children placed between adults			2
the manner of burial indicates a hasty interment showing a need to bury rapidly , each day , a large number of corpses , and need to optimise space during a fatal epidemic or plague when many more deaths were imminent			0
the notorious @entity52 , which wiped out two thirds of the population of @entity4 , did not arrive until the 14th century			1
but the skeletons could reveal the existence of an earlier pandemic that was equally lethal , experts said			0
@entity59 for @entity60 said : ‘ the remains which have been unearthed over the past five months bear no sign of trauma			0
' we will conduct dna and carbon - 14 tests to determine the cause and time of death , as well as information on diet , pathologies , and work - related stresses at the time ’			2
a statement from the @entity74 read : ‘ the excavations in the area of the @entity77 have yielded an exceptional discovery : an instant picture of a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions which hit @entity4 in the early medieval period			1
’ the crypt of corpses sits below the library of the celebrated museum , home to masterpieces such as @entity29 's @entity29 's @entity28 and visited by millions of @entity30 every year ‘ this catastrophe certainly contributed to the long period of decline in the city about which little is known , but perhaps this find alone will be enough to explain it			1
’ the theory of a massacre by a group of invading barbarians has been excluded because of the absence of traumatic wounds , the ministry said			0
neither is there any sign of malnutrition			0
the most likely cause of death was a fatal and highly contagious epidemic such as plague , cholera , dysentery or flu			0
tests to be carried out on the bones and teeth should reveal such a pandemic			0
the gallery are working with researchers from a specialist paleogenetic lab at the university of @entity121			0
the bones will be carbon dated and photographed before being reburied in another area of @entity4 .			1
