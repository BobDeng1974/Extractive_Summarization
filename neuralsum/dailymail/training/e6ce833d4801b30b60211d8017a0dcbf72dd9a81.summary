' they have come here in order to concert their plans to deal with a particularly awkward stage in western capitalism and as such we , the public , are entitled to ask some questions and to hold them to account			0
' refusal : @entity16 and @entity17 both attended the meeting in @entity106 last week but will not say who they met or what aspects of government policy were discussed cunning plan : @entity113 protestor and radio dj @entity114 sailed a protest barge right through the security zone at the @entity6 meeting , which attracts controversy every year disruption : @entity114 protesting from his barge , challenging security measures surrounding the event famous for being shrouded in secrecy , the @entity6 conference took place in @entity126 for the first time since 1998 and conspiracy theorists believe this is where leaders plot world domination			1

confrontation : @entity113 radio host @entity114 ( right ) was on @entity166 ’s @entity165 with @entity133 ( left ) to discuss the secretive @entity6 , which has been taking place over the past week near @entity106 mr @entity133 told him : ' you ( mr @entity114 ) are the worst person i 've ever interviewed			1
@entity16 ( @entity177 ) , thank you for being with us			2
it 's gone half past 11			0
you 're watching the @entity165			2
' the presenter then added : ‘ we have an idiot on the programme today ’ , before using hand gestures to indicate that mr @entity114 had lost his mind , as the @entity113 continued to shout at him off camera			1
mr @entity114 had said : ‘ hey listen , i 'm here to warn people , you keep telling me to shut up			2
this is n't a game			0
our government , the @entity113 , is building @entity191 ( @entity191 ) camps			2

' @entity18 was forced to deny that mr @entity16 's decision to attend this evening ran counter to his pledge			2
the spokesman added : ' the prime minister has always been clear about the importance of transparency , which is why this government has taken a number of steps in terms of publishing more data , more information and making details of meetings available			1
' we publish far more information on meetings than previous governments			0
the prime minister regularly has meetings with key ministers from other countries and with business people and others as part of his job			1

' controversy : protesters gathered to at vehicles arriving at the conference in protest at its secretive nature ' outrageous ' : the huge police operation drafted in to monitor the four - day event , which has previously attracted mass demonstrations , could cost the @entity126 taxpayer as much as £ 2million or more , it has been claimed sweep : police are seen to be doing security checks in bushes outside the hotel grounds since its inception in 1954 , @entity6 has held annual gatherings of 120 - 150 invited political leaders and experts from industry , finance , academia and the media , designed to ' foster dialogue between @entity70 and @entity259 '			0
the group describes the conference as ' a forum for informal , off - the - record discussions about megatrends and the major issues facing the world ' and states that the private nature of the meeting allows participants to ' listen , reflect and gather insights ' without being bound by the conventions of office or by pre-agreed public positions			2
there is no detailed agenda , no resolutions are proposed , no votes are taken , and no policy statements are issued			0
several cars with blacked - out windows entered the gates of the @entity282 , near @entity106 , in @entity283 , were seen arriving the secretive meeting			1
