@entity1 scientists have created soft contact lenses fitted with @entity3 , bringing the possibility of transparent , flexible materials that can be programmed to take pictures or scan a step closer to reality			1
researchers at @entity10 combined graphene with silver nanowires to form a thin , transparent electrode capable of stretching , which overcome the weaknesses of each individual material			1
the newly invented electrodes have widespread possibilities , including taking pictures with soft contact lenses			1
last year , @entity1 scientists created soft contact lenses fitted with @entity3 , bringing the possibility of transparent , flexible materials that can be programmed to take pictures a step closer to reality fact or fiction : contacts capable of scanning data no longer exist only in movies such as @entity28 ' we believe the hybridization between two - dimensional and one - dimensional nano materials presents a promising strategy toward flexible , wearable electronics and implantable bio sensor device , ' @entity29 , professor of the @entity31 and @entity32 at @entity33 , told @entity40			1
high - tech eye wear such as @entity42 and augmented reality contact lenses are nothing new , but the @entity1 scientists are the first to be able to create a flexible , transparent material that can be used in soft contact lenses			1
@entity46 and the @entity47 have been working on similar projects , that seem more like a prop in movies such as @entity28			0
mastermind : nano bio-science professor @entity29 helped create the new contact lens in january last year , they created a prototype of a hard augmented reality contact lens capable of receiving radio signals and transmitting them to the brain through optical nerves , according to @entity60			0
transparent electrodes are more commonly used in touch screen computers , flat - screen tv and light - emitting devices			2
however , the material used to make them , indium tin oxide , is brittle and expensive because of its limited availability			2
the alternative was networks of randomly distributed @entity72 electrodes , which are cheap but not as stable			0
graphene and silver nanowires are also limited by their capabilities			0
the new hybrid material however , has a high electrical and optical performance with mechanical flexibility and can be stretched for flexible electronics			2
scientists discovered little change in its resistance when bent or folded			0
the hybrid transparent electrode has a low " sheet resistance " and high transmittance			1
it was also able to preserve its electrical and optical properties against thermal oxidation condition			0
to demonstrate its possibilities , researchers at @entity10 created a soft contact lens with leds			2
a rabbit made to wear the lens for five hours showed no irritation or health problems , such as having a blood shot eye or trying to rub the area .			0
