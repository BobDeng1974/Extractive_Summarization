by @entity0 an unknown man who captured his own image in a photobooth 445 times over 30 years is proving to be a mystery			2
starting in the 1930s , he took black and white selfies in a photobooth over three decades until the 1960s , charting his passage through time			0
most of the pictures show the mystery man grinning at the camera in the photobooth while others show him almost scowling as his mood changes			0
for three decades this unknown man took over 445 selfies in photobooths from the 1930s to the 1960s			1
they now form a new exhibition at @entity20 it is thought the man may have been a photobooth technician and took the pictures as a way of testing the equipment nobody knows for sure exactly who the man is , or indeed why he took the pictures of himself over the 30 years , especially as taking self portraits were a lot harder back then			2
in some of the pictures he is seen sporting a fedora and smoking a pipe , while other times he is dressed in a suit			0
the pictures are now being shared in an exhibition at @entity20 in @entity41 in an appropriately named show called ' 445 portraits of man '			1

the pictures are owned by historian @entity61 , who bought the images at an antiques show in @entity64 in 2012 he originally only came across a handful of the photographs but the dealer told him there were hundreds more images of the man and he decided to buy them all			1
mr @entity61 told @entity20 : ' as a historian , i knew this was very rare , but on a deeper level , i wondered , " why would somebody want to take almost 500 photos of himself in a photobooth ? " ' ' thereâ € ™ s quite an age difference in the photos : you see him as younger man and then with a white , receding hairline and wrinkles			2
' it is thought the mystery man in the pictures could be from the @entity91 and it is hoped the exhibition will shed new light on his identity mr @entity61 also added that based on conversations with another historian , it could be likely that the mystery man was a photobooth technician , who was taking the pictures to test out the equipment			0
it is also likely that he hailed from the @entity59 @entity91 , and it is hoped the exhibition will shed new light on who the man is			0
