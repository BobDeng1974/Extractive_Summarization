it was supposed to be a way of helping hard - pressed families with tired children cope as they stepped off their long holiday flight			0
but the idea of providing a fleet of 150 complimentary pushchairs at the arrivals hall at @entity9 has backfired – after the majority of them were stolen by passengers			1
instead of leaving the buggies at the designated drop - off point in the baggage reclaim area when their own pushchair arrives on the carousel , some holidaymakers have brazenly walked off with them before loading them into their car or boarding the @entity23 rail service with their newly acquired booty			0
according to border control staff , just three of the original 150 buggies remain the @entity31 were widely welcomed as part of a family - friendly initiative when they were introduced at the airport in @entity36 in april			1
@entity9 bosses said at the time that they wanted to encourage families ‘ to take advantage ’ of the 150 buggies as @entity9 became the @entity43 ’s first airport to offer parents the free service			1
the strollers feature a multi-position reclining seat with adjustable calf rest and normally cost £ 49.99 on the @entity49			0
the @entity9 buggies bear no stamp or label identifying them as airport property , although their canvas seats are decorated in the same shade of blue as @entity9 ’s own - brand logo			1
according to passport control officials based at the @entity63 , only five of the original fleet of buggies remain			2
an order for a further 200 has now been placed but airport workers expect many of these to disappear too unless a security device or alarm is fitted to prevent their removal			2
@entity9 handles up to 60,000 incoming passengers a day and airport managers say it is not surprising that some of the buggies have been misappropriated			2
the pushchairs have no security tag or alarm fitted to stop people walking away with them , or marking to indicate that they belong to the airport a spokesman said : ‘ i know there is some truth [ in the suggestion that scores have been taken ] but i do n’t have any figures			1
‘ it ’s obviously something we are keeping an eye on			0
the buggies are just so popular and we are having to continually replenish them			0
’ the @entity92 , which gave @entity9 its @entity94 @entity43 accreditation after the scheme was launched , said it was ‘ disappointed ’ by the way some parents had abused the idea but insisted the initiative still had its backing			1
‘ we ’ve had a handful taken since april and the reason for ordering 200 more is due to how popular they have been and to help us manage the flow between the aircraft and baggage halls			0
‘ they are stored in a branded wall - mounted shelving unit so are very clearly @entity9 property			0

@entity9 *bought* 150 buggies for parents to use but only three now remain
pushchairs have no security tag or marking to show they belong to airport
*charity* that backed scheme says it is disappointed by *actions* of parents
