by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity3 rugby bosses were criticised today after they unveiled a new £ 91 replica jersey – 10 months before they launch another			1
the shirt , which is made by @entity6 , will be used by the national team in the forthcoming @entity9 internationals and next year ’s @entity11 tournament			1
but @entity13 ( @entity13 ) sources today confirmed that another shirt would go on sale next july in time for the sport ’s world cup , which is being held in @entity3			1
every country taking part will therefore have to change their strips by september			0
it means the @entity3 rugby team will only wear the ‘ @entity36 ’ shirt for around 12 matches before switching again			1
the manufacturers brought out three other ‘ @entity42 ’ and ‘ @entity44 ’ official jerseys at £ 56 each that are also replicas , but not made to the same standards as the ‘ @entity36 ’ strips the players wear			2
critics argue the price and short shelf - life of the new shirts will put struggling parents under pressure with demands from children to keep up with the latest kit			0
it comes after @entity55 called for a ‘ re-think ’ when the @entity3 football team unveiled a £ 90 replica football shirt before this year ’s @entity27			1
the price was not changed despite the prime minister saying fans would ‘ welcome ’ the @entity62 and @entity63 reconsidering the hefty costs , which were branded by some as a ‘ rip - off ’			0
spot the difference : the new kit , worn by @entity69 ( left ) , sees the rose moved to the centre of the shirt former @entity3 rugby captain @entity73 , who part - owns the clothing company @entity75 , said : ‘ it ’s a lot of money for a short - term shirt			1
that ’s the bottom - line			0
‘ i do n’t think a lot of parents will buy this shirt and then another in 10 months ’ time			2
it ’s amazing the pressure parents are put under by their children to buy them			0
‘ it ’s a hell of a lot of money to pay for this new shirt and i do n’t think it will be very comfortable to wear while watching the games in the pub. ’ the new shirt ’s design has not changed much from the previous one launched last september , apart from moving the @entity96 badge from the left to the centre			1
suppliers @entity6 claim the ‘ test ’ jersey costs more because it is made from more flexible polyester and elastane fibres , has increased strength around the arms to prevent ripping and a small ‘ loop ’ collar			2
it also has a ‘ ball deadening ’ rubber grip chest panels that allegedly help players keep hold of the ball			0
the @entity13 also released a scarlet alternate kit , which @entity3 will wear against @entity115 on november 22 demand for the tickets for next year ’s @entity27 saw queues on the online ticket system when the sales window last week			1
over-subscribed games will be decided via a ballot after the sales window shuts on september 29			0
prices for adults range from £ 15 for low - profile group games up to £ 715 for the best seats at the final at @entity129			0
the cheapest adult ticket to watch an @entity3 group game at the same stadium will be £ 75 , and £ 50 for their match against a play - off winner in @entity136			1
@entity13 chief commercial & marketing officer @entity137 said : ‘ as rugby develops , especially at the elite end , there a requirement for a shirt that is technically advanced from a performance and strength perspective and so we develop new kits for the @entity3 team season by season			1
‘ many fans want to show their support for the team by wearing the latest kit so we make it available for them			2
' prices for this season ’s kit are the same as last			0
every penny made or saved at the @entity13 is put back into rugby			2
so all revenues from sales of our shirts will be ploughed back into the game as part of our £ 27m - plus investment in the grassroots every year			0

@entity13 release new @entity3 kit for the @entity174 and @entity11
the shirt costs £ 91 and will only be worn for around 12 matches
