by @entity0 published : 09:57 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 15:24 est , 24 january 2014 the @entity2 is set to begin testing controversial surveillance blimps over @entity4 that can spot a person 340 miles away			1
built by defence firm @entity7 , the blimps will fly in pairs at 10,000 feet			2
@entity7 boasts the project can offer ' 360 degree 24/7 surveillance for 30 days at a time ' - raising major privacy concerns over the project			2
the @entity18 is about to begin testing two of the craft over @entity4 , sparking privacy fears			1
how they work : the blimps can ' see ' for 340 miles			1
they are moored to base stations , and offer 360 degree surveillance capabilites			0
they are designed to look for cruise missiles			2
reports say the @entity18 will launch two white blimps over @entity4 that are tasked with detecting low - flying cruise missiles , but privacy advocates fear they will be outfitted with cameras that can monitor people			1
the program will run for three years starting in october , and can detect missiles from @entity37 to @entity38 on the coast and as far inland as @entity40 , according to the @entity41			1
@entity7 , which makes the craft , advertises them as useful for 24/7 surveillance			0
' what if there was an affordable way the @entity47 and its allies could always “ see ” the threat , instead of having to hope they had a ship or airplane in the vicinity to detect the threat ? , ' it says on its website			0
old - fashioned : blimps have been around for decades , but they only recently came back into usage by the @entity18 the two blimps work together to identify threats such as missiles entering the nearby area			1
' @entity15 , an affordable elevated , persistent over-the - horizon sensor system uses a powerful integrated radar system to detect , track and target a variety of threats , ' @entity7 says			1
@entity66 , as they are now called , are already used to protect @entity47 bases in @entity68 and @entity69			0
they are outfitted with cameras and used to track insurgent and @entity47 troop movements			1
the dirigibles famously snared @entity18 staff seargent @entity74 slaughtering 16 civilians in @entity76 in march 2012			2
@entity77 showed mr @entity74 returning to the base under what he thought was the cloak of early morning darkness			0
the footage showed him carrying the rifle used to carry out the mass murder			0
the blimps are also used at the @entity47 – @entity88 border to try to catch illegal immigrants , @entity86 noted			0
the army has commissioned defense contractor @entity7 to provide the airships , which will hover at an altitude of about 10,000 feet over the @entity18 's @entity93 , for the multi-year trial run			1
only missiles : the @entity2 insists the aerostats will only be used to search for missiles , but they are already used overseas to monitor insurgent movements will @entity99 be watching : the @entity100 is also concerned the airships will be used to watch people on the ground privacy advocates worry the blimps will also be equipped with high - resolution cameras and radar to track the movements of civilians			1
‘ right now there are no rules , ’ @entity110 , of the @entity100 , told @entity86			0
‘ there 's nothing that bars us from having high - powered cameras monitoring our every public movement			2
’ another @entity100 analyst echoed those thoughts to the @entity41			0
‘ that 's the kind of massive persistent surveillance we 've always been concerned about with drones , ’ said @entity120			0
‘ it 's part of this trend we ’ve seen since 9/11 , which is the turning inward of all these surveillance technologies			0
’ the blimps will fly in pairs at 10,000 feet			0
maker @entity7 boasts the project can offer ' 360 degree 24/7 surveillance for 30 days at a time ' - raising major privacy concerns over the project			0
highly visible : people as far away as @entity137 will be able to see the blimps high above them the @entity18 insisted in a letter to the paper that the aerostats , which can fly for as long as 30 consecutive days , will be the first line of defense against incoming missiles			1
‘ the primary mission ... is to track airborne objects			2
its secondary mission is to track surface moving objects such as vehicles or boats			2
the capability to track surface objects does not extend to individual people			1
’ the government also said that there are currently no plans to put cameras capable of tracking people on the blimps , but it could not rule out doing so in the future			1
as it is currently constructed , the program is expected to cost $ 2.7billion			1
civilians as far away as @entity137 will be able to see them from the ground			0
only time will tell if the aerostats are looking back .			0

the $ 2.7billion program is slated to start in october and run for three years
the blimps will hover over @entity18 *property* in @entity4
powerful radar allows them to spot objects 340 miles away
they will be able to track missiles from @entity37 to @entity38 as far inland as @entity40
privacy advocates worry they will be fitted with cameras to track individual people 's movements
