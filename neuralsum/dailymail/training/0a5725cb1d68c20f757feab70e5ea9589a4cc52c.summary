@entity0 says it will be impossible not to cast his mind back to the last @entity3 final when @entity5 face @entity6 on friday but he also warns that the holders have not just come to @entity8 to hand over their crown			1
' right now i ’m not thinking about the last final but when i ’m there out on the pitch and i have them in front of me , i ’m sure the memories will all come flooding back , ' he says			2
@entity0 was on the bench as @entity17 scored the most famous goal in @entity5 ’s history against the @entity20 in @entity21 four years ago			1
the team to beat ? @entity5 lift the @entity3 after defeating @entity6 in 2010 winner : @entity17 ( centre ) scored the historic winning goal for @entity5 after a tough battle in @entity21 he remembers : ' when he scored , the first thing i did was look across to the linesman to see if he had lifted his flag , to make sure there was no offside			1
then i looked up at the scoreboard and saw ‘ 115m , 1 - 0			1
’ ' the time spent waiting for the final whistle seemed so long			2
we were trying to pressure the fourth official to make sure that he did n’t add on too much time			1
those final five minutes were torture			2
' @entity6 can take a revenge of sorts tomorrow in @entity43 but @entity0 warns that despite winning the last three major tournaments @entity5 have not lost their hunger and that even their older players are ready to give everything again , one more time			1
he says : ' when you look at the ages of some of the key players , this is probably the last @entity3 for them			2
but they will want to play at this tournament , even if it is their last , and i am sure they will want to say to the world : ‘ we ’re still here ’			0
history : @entity17 scored the decisive goal four minutes before the end of extra-time @entity5 : @entity0 is hoping the @entity70 squad can defend their @entity3 crown ' and then the young players coming up behind them have a brilliant future			1
they more or less play the same style of football and they can give the national team continuity			1
' one of those young players will be @entity0 who says : ' people ask has the motivation gone with so many tournaments won but i ’m only 26			1
it does n’t take any motivation away from me			0
it makes me want to live it all again			0
' @entity0 ’s @entity3 chances were almost ruined by falling out of favour at @entity88			1
he found a new home at @entity90 but joined the club at a difficult moment and could easily have missed the final cut			0
' ' sometimes [ when playing for @entity90 ] i thought ‘ i have to prove a point to the national team here ’ but it ’s much better to go out onto the pitch and play as you always do for your club and let things happen naturally			2
it ’s no good thinking : " i ’ve got to play well to go to the @entity3 "			0
' new home : @entity0 ( right ) signed for @entity90 from @entity88 in january prepared : @entity0 challenges @entity104 ( left ) during a @entity5 training session on tuesday there was silence from @entity108 in those difficult months			1
it ’s not the @entity5 coach ’s style to be in contact with the country ’s foreign legion but when it came to picking his 23 he had no doubts about including the @entity90 midfielder just as he had done in the @entity118 final one year ago when @entity0 started the final against @entity8			1
can @entity5 put right what went wrong last time in the @entity121 ? ' lots of things went against us that day , ' he says			1
' the physical difference between the two sides and the atmosphere both worked for @entity8 and we had that bit of bad luck when @entity131 cleared one off the line from @entity133			0
' i think if we had scored then , it would have taken the edge off of the atmosphere and the game			2
the stadium was incredible , and there was so much noise			0
' then they scored two goals while we missed out on that @entity133 chance , and that ’s where the game got away from us			2
they will be among the favourites again but so will we			0
' @entity0 dismisses the idea that the @entity118 defeat showed that @entity5 had been ‘ found out ’ as a team with only one way of playing			1
' i think we do have variation within our game			0
we have players who can open up the pitch when the game is tight			0
we have strikers who are physically strong and we have full - backs who can overlap			2
' i think the coach has a very clear footballing identity , a way of playing that we all believe in , but i also think that we have other options			0
looking back on the @entity8 game , for example , they were better than us			0
it was n’t a lack of variety or an inability to play another way			0
' pedigree : @entity0 scored against @entity176 during @entity5 's @entity178 final win in @entity179 this time @entity5 have a ‘ @entity183 ’ of their own with @entity180 offering something different in attack			1
' in principle , he ’s different , ' says @entity0			1
' if you ask the strikers who have played for @entity5 over the last few years they will tell you that it ’s a very hard job			1
the way that @entity5 plays makes it difficult for them			1
that is why @entity194 [ @entity195 ] or [ @entity131 ] @entity196 have played in attack and it ’s been a good solution			2
but i think @entity180 can bring what he has brought to @entity202			1
that ’s the fundamental thing : goals , goals , goals			0
' he can battle with the central defenders			0
he can receive the ball with his back to goal and bring others in			0
he can get behind defences although that is harder when you play for @entity5 because teams sit so deep			1
strength : the @entity90 star hopes @entity180 can make an impact in @entity8 ' but he played fantastically this season			1
his team has played incredibly well and he was often their most important player			0
he ’s done enough to be called up , that ’s for sure			0
' back in @entity5 expectations will also be high and only heightened by the memories a game against the @entity20 will bring to the surface			1
' people get used to winning ; it becomes all or nothing , ' says @entity0 of the increased demands back home			1
could that same expectation count even more against @entity8 than it will against @entity5 ? ' i spoke to @entity235 about this some months ago and he said : ‘ everyone is expecting us to win ’			1
i think that ’s a double - edge sword			2
it can really carry you through out on the pitch and give you incredible energy but it things do n’t go well then it ’s an extra pressure			0
” favourites : @entity5 are likely to have to face their @entity118 conquerors @entity8 if they are to defend their crown @entity0 says recreation will again be important as @entity5 try to distance themselves from the pressure			1
' we had a games room four years ago with cards , pool , table tennis and it helped get us through			0
i would play table - tennis with @entity258 and @entity259 who ’s very good			2
' games time will once again help players switch off from the demands of being the team everyone wants to beat			0
no country has ever won four straight tournaments			2
atmosphere : @entity0 believes keeping up team spirit will be key to dealing with @entity3 pressure to do it , and do it in style would probably not only mean @entity5 kept their ‘ world ’s greatest ’ crown but also inherited the 1970 @entity8 team ’s ‘ all - time greatest ’ title			1
' in 2012 we realised that it was not enough to win or play well			0
we had to win and play well			0
that ’s great because it shows that people have high expectations of us and that comes from what we have achieved before			0
' but it also means that people sometimes forget that winning is not so easy			0
the demands are huge and what we want to achieve is huge too			0
' talent : the @entity70 midfielder will look to help his side keep their ' world 's greatest ' crown			2

@entity0 recalls being on the bench as @entity17 won the @entity297 for @entity5
@entity17 scored in the 115th minute against @entity6 to hand @entity5 the trophy
@entity0 is hoping the national side can emulate 2010 success
the 26 - year - old believes @entity180 can add a new *dimension* to the @entity5 attack
