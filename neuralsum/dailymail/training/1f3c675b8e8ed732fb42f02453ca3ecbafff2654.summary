when @entity1 was dissecting his @entity3 managerial debut on august 16 , he insinuated the 2 - 1 defeat against @entity5 was just a symptom of teething problems			1
' we have to remember that it is just one game of many games and you shall not be champion in this moment but in may , ' he added , having just been baptised a @entity14 manager			2
that opening day defeat reeked of same old , same old from the season before yet , with the reverse fixture at the @entity19 on saturday , @entity15 can no longer turn to the same excuse			1
a poll by the @entity22 found 81 per cent of @entity3 fans back @entity1 @entity24 ( left ) completes a sprint drill as @entity3 captain @entity26 watches on @entity15 's men are put through their paces ahead of the @entity14 match with @entity5 @entity31 ( left ) and @entity26 sprint together at the @entity32 in @entity33 @entity34 @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 ; @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 @entity42 @entity43 , @entity26 expectations have dwindled at @entity45			1
going into that game against @entity5 in mid-august , supporters wanted proof they were ready to challenge their noisy neighbours for the @entity14 title			1
instead they realised a slick public relations campaign and the appointment of an iconic manager do n't make for a quick fix			0
more than six months on , they 're third – 12 points behind @entity57 and five off @entity58 – and their lack of progress in a title challenge has made @entity63 qualification a must			2
most supporters are content with that , and why not ? the horror show of the year before under @entity68 saw @entity3 lose their place among @entity72 's elite and if @entity15 can right that wrong , then that 's a significant improvement			1
@entity3 manager @entity15 holds a press conference after his style of play was criticised @entity15 has been no stranger to press room drama at any of his previous clubs before @entity3 @entity24 has been partnered with @entity78 but the duo have not clicked at @entity3 @entity26 ( left ) controls the ball under pressure from @entity83 's @entity82 in their last @entity14 win this was backed by a poll in the @entity22 which found 81 per cent of supporters approved of @entity15 's first season in charge , 12 weeks ahead of the may finish			1
when put to the manager , he said , tongue in cheek : ' over 80 per cent ? unbelievable			0
in spite of your [ the media ’s ] criticism , fantastic			0
i can repeat it , more than 80 per cent			0
' fail to qualify for the @entity63 , however , and watch that number spiral			2
@entity3 have lost just four games in the @entity14 this season , and are on a run of one defeat in 19 games			1
yet their results , without a doubt , have been better than the performances			0
take , for example , their latest @entity14 win			2
a 3 - 1 victory against second - bottom @entity83 on february 11 was expected , but flattering to say the least			1
as was their 2 - 1 win over @entity116 on november 22 and their 2 - 1 win over @entity119 on december 8 , among others			1
offer supporters one defeat in 19 games , a place in the @entity126 quarter - finals and third in the @entity14 before that @entity5 opener , however , and most would snap your hands off			1
the ends are justifying the means , yet there has not been a game this year where rival supporters , namely those at the @entity137 , sit back and think : ' uh oh , they 're back			0
' even @entity139 reckons it 's been miserable			1
supporters pay good money to be entertained , to watch attacking , creative , free - flowing football , not to be on edge			2
as the reverse @entity5 fixture arrives , this has been in short supply			2
even with the £ 153million influx of @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity31 , @entity151 , @entity40 , and , for one season , @entity78			0
in trying to establish @entity3 as the monster they once were under sir @entity155 , questions have been thrown @entity15 's way , just as they were when he was manager of @entity158 between 1997 and 2000			1
his three - year reign in @entity160 was filled with skepticism about his tactics , decisions and philosophy			0
at the @entity165 he dropped @entity166 – a @entity167 genius and 1999 @entity169 winner – and was hounded about it by the @entity158 media			0
a friction that ultimately led him to the exit			0
former @entity3 midfielder @entity139 has branded @entity15 's style of play as ' miserable ' it has n't been all too different in @entity33			1
why , for example , waste @entity26 in midfield ? are you finished with the partnership of @entity24 and @entity78 ? what 's happened to @entity40 – your first purchase at £ 29m ? why persist with the 3 - 5 - 2 formation ? is your relentless side - to - side football limiting @entity31 's influence ? and so on			2
yet there appears method in @entity15 's madness			1
their extraordinary run of having only lost against @entity119 since november 3 is no fluke			0
luck does not carry a team that far , and it will worry @entity116 , @entity195 , @entity119 and @entity196 to see a side playing average but winning			0
on saturday , in @entity5 , @entity15 can exact revenge for that august 16 defeat			2
' we should n't forget a lot of my players in the first match were not there			0
@entity150 was n't there , @entity151 was not there , @entity31 was not there , @entity149 was not playing , ' he says in mitigation			0
' it 's another match			0
it may not be to keep them in the running for the @entity14 title with @entity57 and @entity58 , but @entity15 can ill afford to miss out on @entity63 qualification			1
progress under their new manager is being made but time waits for no man , not even him			0
@entity42 rues a missed chance for @entity3 as the @entity223 helps them qualify for the @entity63 the expectations at @entity3 have dwindled under @entity15 from title hopefuls to top four chasers			1

@entity1 's first @entity14 match was against @entity5
@entity3 lost 2 - 1 against @entity5 at @entity45 on his debut
@entity15 's team face @entity5 at the @entity19 in the reverse fixture
@entity139 criticised the new manager for his ' miserable ' style of play
@entity3 are expected to qualify for the @entity63 at the very least
there appears to be method in @entity15 's madness after a good run
