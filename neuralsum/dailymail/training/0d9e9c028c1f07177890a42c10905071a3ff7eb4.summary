a mother has rounded on @entity1 over ‘ mouldy ’ sandwiches delivered to pupils under his free school meals scheme			1
the deputy prime minister was challenged during his radio phone - in by a caller who complained that sandwiches sent to her daughter ’s school had ‘ turned up frozen ’ or with ‘ mouldy bread ’			1
she said the sandwiches were part of ‘ very unhealthy ’ lunches which contained items such as doughnuts			0
the revelations are embarrassing for mr @entity1 who has insisted his £ 1billion free meals scheme – which entitles all four to seven - year - olds to a free school lunch – will make pupils healthier and give them more energy to learn			1
but critics have argued that many schools are not equipped to implement the policy and that its benefits have been over-stated			0
mr @entity1 admitted it was ‘ totally unacceptable ’ that pupils were being served poor quality food			1
@entity30 told him during the show on @entity43 that a whole term into the free meals initiative , her daughter ’s school still lacked the kitchen facilities to prepare hot food for pupils			2
children were instead being offered cold packed lunches provided by a contractor			2
mr @entity1 , pictured leaving the @entity43 studios , has faced criticism of the policy to introduce free school meals for all under - 7s she said : ‘ the sandwiches are either cheese , ham , or tuna			1
there is no capacity for requests such as no butter , or whatever , if they do n’t particularly like it			0
’ on one occasion ‘ the sandwiches turned up frozen ’ and on another ‘ they turned up in mouldy bread ’ , @entity30 said , adding : ‘ most parents i know are now sending in their children with additional food because they ’re coming home hungry			0
’ the @entity74 leader told her : ‘ it sounds totally unacceptable and you are quite right as a mum to be immensely annoyed			2
’ he added : ‘ if what you said is absolutely right , it has n’t changed at all since the beginning of term , and that they are providing such poor value and poor quality cold meals , that ’s completely wrong			2
the deputy prime minister has championed the policy of free lunches for under - 7s mr @entity1 yesterday made mince pies with year 5 pupils from @entity92 in @entity93 during a visit to announce take up figures for free school meals ‘ it ’s not what is happening across the vast majority of the rest of the school system			1
’ he promised to look into the case and ‘ make sure something is done ’			0
a spokesman for @entity25 said : ‘ we have received no complaints about mouldy food			0
‘ on one occasion frozen sandwiches were delivered in error , but these were returned to the contractor and replaced with freshly made ones			0
’ they said the school is having a kitchen installed to provide hot meals , but that the current packed lunches ‘ meet national guidelines ’			1
mr @entity1 ’s on - air exchange with @entity30 on thursday came as he released figures showing that take - up of free meals is running at 85 per cent across the country			1
but in the @entity125 it dips to 81.5 per cent , with more children preferring to bring their own food			0
take - up was expected to be 87 per cent , but only three @entity130 regions reached this level – the @entity132 , the @entity133 and inner @entity93 .			0

all under - 7s now offered free school lunch in schools in @entity130
deputy prime minister faced criticism on his *weekly* radio phone - in
@entity30 , from @entity20 , complained packed lunches offered were unhealthy
@entity1 vows to investigate ' totally unacceptable ' poor quality meals
