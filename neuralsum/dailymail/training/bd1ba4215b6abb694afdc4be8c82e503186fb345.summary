by @entity0 published : 12:37 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 13:57 est , 22 march 2013 fresh - faced and strikingly pretty , the girl staring into the camera in the first clip from @entity4 looks happy and confident			1
by the last , she is a bruised , battered shell of her former self , holding a handwritten note that when translated reads : ' help me			2
i do n't know if i will get to see tomorrow			2
' the identity of the @entity14 woman featured in the film , shot over the course of 2012 , is unknown and many have questioned the authenticity of the injuries and suspect the video may actually be part of a public education campaign			1
regardless , it has shocked the country and brought the issue of @entity26 back on to the national agenda			1
harrowing : the unnamed victim holds up a sign that reads : ' help me			2
i do not know if i will see tomorrow ' @entity31 faced : at the beginning , the woman looks happy and radiant but gradually , bruises start to creep in the film , which went viral after being posted on the @entity37 site , has generated hundreds of mostly supportive messages , although a couple question the veracity of the video			1
@entity37 user , @entity42 wrote : this looks like film make up			2
i 'm not sure someone in this emotional state would be this dedicated to filming her face being beat			2
' another clue to it being make - up is the dramatized eyes and music flows with the edit			0
i 'm sure that they just wanted to make a point against violence towards women			1
' for others , however , whether the clip is real is irrelevant , with many saying that whatever the film 's origin , the message is too important to be ignored			0
@entity63 said : ' overall it is a good message			0
humans ( male or female ) who abuse others are some of the worse type of scum			0
' it 's sad that an emotional connection often leaves people clinging to those who hurt them			0
' horrific : as the year unfolds , the woman 's injuries get progressively more appalling despicable : by the last few scenes , the victim looks seriously injured , with a cut lip and badly damaged eye another , @entity81 , added : ' this life is far too short for anyone to put up with any kind of abuse			0
if you feel that your life is worse with a person around than it would be if you were alone , then it is time to leave			0
' go to family , friends , shelters , but go			0
no one deserves happiness more than you			0
if your sister or your mother was in this situation you would fight for them			0
you would tell them to exit			0
why not the same for yourself ? ' domestic violence is a serious problem in @entity14 , with an estimated 19,000 cases a year , according to local newspaper , @entity106			1
the @entity107 has also produced reports on the problem , which suggest that violence against women occurs on a scale unheard of in the @entity112			1
a @entity107 funded survey last year showed that 54.2 per cent of women in @entity14 , like the woman in the film , suffer from some form of domestic violence , with 90 per cent of the cases involving a male perpetrator			1
sadly , deaths from domestic violence are not uncommon			1
shockingly , domestic violence victims account for a horrifying 30 per cent of all murders in @entity14 - compared with just one per cent in the @entity125 - according to @entity14 government figures source : women 's aid ( womensaid.org.uk )			1

video is *believed* to have been made in 2012
it is not known if it is authentic or part of a public education campaign
more than 50 per cent of @entity14 women have suffered some form of domestic violence
domestic violence is behind 30 per cent of murders in the @entity144 country
in the @entity112 , it accounts for between *16* and 25 per cent of all violent crime
