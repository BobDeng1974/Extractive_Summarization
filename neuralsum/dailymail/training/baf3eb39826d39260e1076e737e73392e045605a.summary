it is a myth that @entity2 winners leave it late			1
not years in advance , maybe , but not as the last grain of sand drips from the hourglass either			0
@entity10 is running out for @entity11 and his men			1
this , a chance to defeat the world champions in their final meeting before the @entity16 , ended in defeat			0
@entity19 , the next opponents , have not been beaten since 2006			1
very soon @entity21 will have his last game against @entity24 before facing them at the @entity2 group stage			1
then it is the @entity28 and the final chance to leave a footprint on @entity31 , who are also @entity2 opponents			1
@entity11 looks on dejectedly after yet another @entity35 defeat to the @entity36 @entity37 can not hide his disappointment , but @entity35 need to pick themselves up , and soon @entity35 21 - 24 @entity36 highlights the calendar lies			1
@entity2 is not , as is frequently stated , a year away			1
prior to the big kick - off , @entity21 has 80 minutes to prove his point to @entity24 , the same for @entity31			1
zero for the @entity36 now			1
if @entity35 were to meet @entity46 ’s team at the @entity2 , their most recent memories would include conceding a try in the 22nd phase of play , and losing a 10 - minute spell 3 - 0 to 14 men			1
no outcome is guaranteed by historical precedent , but @entity36 would have the psychological advantage			2
dominating and winning against @entity35 would feel familiar to them			2
@entity2 winners often produce a calling card			2
the summer before @entity35 brought home the @entity60 in 2003 , they travelled to the @entity61 and played like it belonged in their hands			2
they beat @entity36 in @entity65 and @entity24 in @entity66 – the first time an @entity35 team had won on @entity70 soil			1
they arrived as @entity73 champions , too			0
@entity36 were similarly relentless going into the 2011 tournament			2
even @entity19 , winners from left field in 2007 , had served notice of their potential			2
in 2003 @entity35 went to the southern hemisphere and beat the best in their own back yard to send a message sir @entity84 's side went on to win the @entity2 having proved they could mix it with the best they were the only team to beat the @entity36 in 2006 , and won 24 - 15 at @entity86			1
their margin of victory over @entity90 in 2005 , 134 - 3 , was a world record			0
so @entity21 , despite another weekend of taking the positives , needs more than honour in defeat			0
the tightness of the score flattered the hosts			0
yes , there were opportunities squandered , not least by a @entity101 fumble , but only an inexplicably missed penalty by @entity103 stopped the @entity36 ’ 14 winning their passage of play 6 - 0 , and in the same period they were repelled no more than a yard from the posts			1
@entity35 could not escape from their 22 in that time , let alone capitalise on numerical superiority			2
the 2003 vintage went to @entity24 knowing that they were already considered the team to beat after saturday 's struggle , @entity35 will have to improve to set down a marker for @entity24 and @entity19 it was this segment that brought back memories of what a @entity2 winning team looks like			1
in 2003 , pre-ennoblement @entity84 went south , against the better judgment of many , to prepare for the @entity2 in @entity24			1
it was pessimistically presumed @entity35 would get sorted out , probably @entity120 too , and the entire episode would be a catastrophe			2
he thought @entity35 had the best team in the world and wanted to prove this prior to the competition			2
he did n’t want a @entity2 meeting with @entity24 to also have to double up as a first victory down there			1
@entity35 beat @entity36 , beat @entity24 and @entity120 remained intact			1
when they faced @entity24 in @entity130 in the final roughly four months later it was not as underdogs , but as recent winners over course and distance			2
they played as a team who had already shown world champion potential			0
and that is what @entity36 demonstrated on saturday			2
the three - point win with reduced numbers in horrid , wet conditions ? that contained an echo of @entity84 ’s team in @entity65			0
@entity35 had gone down to 13 players			2
it should have been the end of them but they held on and @entity120 kicked a penalty shortly before the cavalry arrived			0
@entity151 's side have shown , yet again , that they are the team to beat at next year 's @entity2 it was one of the moments when all but the most one - eyed @entity154 caught a glimpse of the future			1
it was champion form , @entity2 - winning form			0
@entity35 did not have to take the positives or hide behind management speak that night			0
their boldest statement was the scoreline ; its supporting logic etched on the field of play			0
that was the difference at @entity86 on saturday			0
@entity35 were still in game management mode in the post-match press conference , @entity36 ’s most eloquent sentences had long been delivered			1
@entity11 has considerable mitigation , not least that he was taking on the world champions with 11 players out injured			0
@entity175 crosses over as @entity35 , despite their early dominance , could n't maintain a lead @entity101 , whose fumble close to the line was a major turning point , is tackled by @entity181 yet only a minority of the missing would have started , and he might have rotten luck 11 months from now , too			0
@entity36 won the @entity2 without @entity185 , or his understudy , @entity187 at fly - half , and the third choice , @entity175 , came off through injury after 34 minutes in the final			1
the best teams find a way of overcoming adversity : world champions , certainly			0
we have been down this road before , and recently			0
it was only last summer that @entity199 sent the best prepared @entity35 football team in @entity2 history to @entity202 , and came home having had his hubris well and truly exposed			1
@entity35 ’s rugby camp is inclined to similar claims			0
upgraded training headquarters , a new performance centre and @entity210 pitch , altitude training booked for next summer and sports scientists imported at significant expense			0
naturally , somebody from the world of cycling is also involved – in this case @entity219 , who helped @entity221 become the first @entity223 winner of the @entity224			0
@entity226 's try was on of the positives to take from the game , but @entity35 now need to pick up some wins what does this prove ? that sport in @entity35 has money			1
it can throw giant investment at projects such as winning the @entity16 , it can splurge on the best preparation and like any other vast corporate entity it knows how to make precisely the right statements to cover any failings or inefficiencies			0
so in defeat , @entity35 ’s hierarchy spoke very well , of margins and positives and the many months between now and their date with destiny			1
yet at some time in the coming months , @entity35 have to start playing like @entity2 winners			1
they have to lay down markers , intimidate and disconcert , as future world champions do			0
what can be guaranteed ? nothing			0
those 10 minutes in @entity65 did not make woodward a certain @entity2 winner			0
but , from there , the rest of the world thought he might be : and that is half the battle won .			0

@entity35 will not play @entity36 again before @entity2
last memory of @entity36 will be this demoralising defeat at @entity86
@entity11 's side must improve against @entity24 and @entity19
