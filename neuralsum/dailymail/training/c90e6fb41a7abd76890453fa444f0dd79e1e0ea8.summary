more than one fifth of the @entity2 's workers will be having their office @entity3 at some point this week			2
but a new poll reveals that those getting drunk with colleagues would be wise to think ahead and pack a change of clothes ... just in case			2
almost one in six of us ( 15 per cent ) admit to not having made it home after their office party			0
it all started so innocently : almost one in six of us ( 15 per cent ) admit to not having made it home after their office party ( file photo ) the @entity21 research , commissioned for the @entity23 mobile app shows that more than a million people ( 1,070,518 ) have turned up to work the next day wearing the same clothes as the day before – doing the work ‘ walk of shame ’ after the staff @entity3			1
whilst easy to believe that younger team members will be the ones to party into the early hours , the study has revealed that @entity32 are in fact a nation of ‘ older - @entity35 ’ with 45 - 54 year old @entity3 goers almost twice as likely to have committed the office walk of shame compared to the national average ( 5 per cent compared to 3 per cent )			1
results also reveal that as many as 750,000 @entity32 have slept in the office on the night of their @entity3 , with 45 - 54 year old men over twice as likely to have done so compared to the overall national average ( 5 per cent vs. 2 per cent )			1
but grabbing a night ’s sleep in the office is very much a last resort			0
roughly a third said they would be likely to book a suitably priced hotel room if they could find one quickly and easily			0
do n't get caught out : more than one in 10 of those surveyed have opted to stay in a hotel room after a staff @entity3 ( file photo ) more than one in 10 of those surveyed ( 11 per cent ) have opted to stay in a hotel room after a staff @entity3 as it is cheaper than travelling home late at night , and six per cent know a colleague who has booked a hotel room intending to spend the night with a co-worker			2
with a number of hotel rooms in cities like @entity65 and @entity66 available for as little as £ 40 , it comes as no surprise that many opt to get a good night ’s rest than take a taxi home			0
apps like @entity23 help you find a bed close to wherever you happen to be partying , and use of the app soars between seven and 10 p.m. when people start preparing for a heavy night			0
@entity79 from @entity23 said : ' in the current economic climate it ’s no surprise that so many of us intend to let our hair down at the work @entity3 , to sleep off the excitement of the night before and tackle the " morning after " in the office			1

one million have come into work day after @entity3 wearing the same clothes as night before
45 - 54 year olds almost twice as likely to have done so than the national average
