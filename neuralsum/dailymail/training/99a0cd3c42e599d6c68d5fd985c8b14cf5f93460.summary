by @entity1 reporter more than 90,000 are performed in the @entity2 each year and patients often require a second knee replacement or a ' revision ' a computer program could help cut costly or unnecessary surgery on patients with knee replacements			1
scientists have developed a diagnostic tool to counter the soaring rise of knee replacement operations			0
more than 90,000 are performed in the @entity2 each year but this is expected to rise by more than 600 per cent by 2030 due to an ageing population , obesity and younger people having the surgery			2
patients often require a second knee replacement or ‘ revision ’ , which can cost up to four times as much as the original surgery and bring increased risk of infection and failure			1
but researchers at the @entity28 have developed a semi-automated computer program to assess the condition of a replacement , a task usually performed ‘ by eye ’ by surgeons			1
it gives a score for radiolucency – the region surrounding a hip or knee replacement which is dark on an x-ray and can progressively worsen with loosening – provides a more accurate , independent method to assess the need for extra surgery			2
@entity49 , professor of @entity50 at the university , said : ‘ until we did the work that we did , all radiolucency lines were looked at by eye by the surgeons			0
' what was interesting to us was the lack of agreement between different surgeons looking at the x-rays			0
‘ using a digital computerised tool that accurately identifies patients with progressive pathological radiolucency , showing severely loosening knee replacements , would ensure correct surgical procedures are applied			2
' this will improve outcomes and save money spent on operations which may not ultimately be successful			0
’ knee replacements are a highly successful method of relieving the pain and disability of knee osteoarthitis , which usually affects those aged over 40			0
researchers at the @entity28 have developed a semi-automated computer program to assess the condition of a replacement , a task usually performed ' by eye ' by surgeons studies suggest almost one in two people will suffer from symptomatic osteoarthritis – the degeneration of joint cartilage and underlying bone – of the knee during their lifetime			1
the study , published in the @entity90 , compared surgeons ’ assessments of radiolucency in 38 knee replacement radiographs with those made by the computer program			1
there was large variation between the surgeons ’ results , with total agreement in less than 10 per cent of zones examined , compared with 81.6 per cent in those of the program ’s .			0

more than 90,000 knee replacements are performed in the @entity2 each year
patients often require a second knee replacement or ' revision '
these can cost up to four times as much as the original surgery
semi-automated computer program will assess condition of a replacement
this task is usually performed ' by eye ' by surgeons - costing more money
