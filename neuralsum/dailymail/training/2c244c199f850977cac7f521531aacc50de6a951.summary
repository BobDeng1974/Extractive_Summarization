@entity1 fans will only be able to buy tickets for their forthcoming trip to @entity4 direct from the @entity6 club — amid fears the stricken @entity9 giants could soon slide into insolvency again			1
in normal circumstances , @entity4 would hand the @entity13 outfit a substantial allocation of briefs which @entity1 would then sell on to their own fans before reimbursing the @entity17 at a later date			1
however , it ’s understood the @entity20 club have been concerned by suggestions of another financial collapse at @entity13 and that @entity1 may not be in a position to fulfil their obligations			1
@entity26 's plans to increase lending from £ 10m to £ 13m have been met with opposition by @entity13 support rangers are currently in discussions with @entity4 over ticket sales for the upcoming league match rangers are said to need £ 6.5 million just to see them through until the summer and , as things stand , are in no position to meet next thursday ’s payroll obligations			1
the club required an emergency loan of £ 500,000 from director @entity40 to avoid being wound - up by @entity42 ( @entity42 ) earlier this month , although this has since been paid back from the funds raised by selling @entity45 to @entity46			0
plans by @entity26 to increase his lending by £ 10m to £ 13m have been strongly resisted by the @entity13 support , with the @entity50 owner seeking security over @entity13 and @entity52			1
and , with no obvious solution to the growing financial crisis at @entity13 , @entity4 have moved to insulate themselves ahead of the clash on february 20 by ensuring the proceeds from ticket sales goes straight into their hands			1
briefs will go on sale at @entity20 on tuesday , january 27			0
@entity26 wants to use the @entity13 and club 's training ground as security against his loan a @entity1 spokesperson said on wednesday : ‘ the club are currently in discussions with @entity4 on this matter			1
’ meanwhile , the @entity71 will back the @entity72 with hard cash if need be in their bid to keep @entity13 out of @entity26 ’s clutches			1
a spokesman for the group said : ‘ the @entity71 was launched by @entity13 legends @entity78 and @entity80 in 2012 to help safeguard and protect the club ’s future and assets			1
‘ in recent days it has become crystal clear that the club ’s current board is considering the use of @entity13 and @entity52 in order to secure a further loan from @entity26			1
‘ mr @entity26 already has security over @entity93 and the @entity94 and the @entity71 , like almost all @entity1 supporters , feels securitising our historic stadium and training ground is a step too far			1
‘ @entity13 , in our view , is sacrosanct			2
it is a memorial to the 66 who lost their lives ( in the @entity104 )			0
@entity106 protest in the hope of saving the future of their club ‘ some of the greatest names in @entity114 football history have graced the hallowed turf down the years and it should never be used as collateral in order to secure a loan that is not in the best interests of the club			0
‘ for that reason , the @entity71 confirms it is willing to provide support and assistance to any fan group determined to protect the club ’s assets			0
‘ we enjoyed a positive meeting with representatives from the @entity72 yesterday and we have agreed to back their initiative to prevent the securitisation of @entity13 and @entity52			2
’ a statement on the @entity72 website expressed its delight and gratitude to the @entity71 ’s backing and vowed : ‘ we will work closely with the @entity71 going forward to ensure every avenue is explored			0
the @entity72 is not taking this action for the benefit of only its own members but for every @entity1 fan and fan group			2
former @entity1 director @entity143 is another person to have put his support behind the scheme ‘ @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 should be under no illusions that we will examine every available legal remedy to stop them passing our club ’s assets to mr @entity26			2
’ on wednesday , @entity80 and @entity149 responded to oldco director @entity143 ’s assertion that their days are numbered as he , too , pledged his support to the @entity72 and @entity1 first groups			2
a statement released on behalf of the @entity1 football board chairman and director said : ‘ so , like an episode of @entity164 , @entity143 emerges from his borders lair having vowed never to return			0
he says he expects a smear campaign against himself and @entity167 and in the same breath compares the @entity1 board to @entity170			0
‘ if mr @entity143 and mr @entity167 ever do get anywhere near the club they are welcome to carry out a robust financial investigation			0
the @entity149 brothers have never taken a penny from the club and nor have they claimed any expenses			0
‘ one begins to wonder if we are not dealing with @entity179 as opposed to @entity143 who appears to have hypnotised himself and his cohorts into obliterating the memory fact that they sold their beloved club for one @entity185			0
@entity1 men ? you decide			0

rangers travel to @entity4 in the @entity190 february 20
instead of @entity1 selling tickets to their fans for the game , they will only be *purchasable* from @entity4
the @entity17 would usually be reimbursed by @entity1 for the tickets sold
but are concerned about another financial collapse at @entity13
