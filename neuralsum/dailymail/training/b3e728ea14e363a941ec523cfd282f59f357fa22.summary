by @entity0 published : 06:47 est , 1 february 2013 updated : 09:01 est , 1 february 2013 a father who had three fingers ripped off in a road accident is keen to get back on his motorbike after having his digits replaced by his toes			1
bike racer @entity7 , 31 , underwent a 12 - hour operation where two of his toes were removed to compensate for the fingers he lost on his right hand			1
the father - of - three from @entity14 will soon undergo another operation to remove scar tissue but said he was delighted to get his grip back			1
you 've got to hand it to him : @entity7 lost three fingers on his right hand			1
he had his middle and ring finger replaced using the toe next to his big toe from each foot best foot forward : mr @entity7 still has good foot function despite having the digit from next to each big toe removed he said : ' i was willing to do anything to get back on the bike			1
but it has also meant i can do all kinds of day - to - day things like hold a laptop or grab a pint			1
' they are n't the prettiest of things but i do n't really care			1
all that matters is that i have some function back			0
' the auto - electrics expert , who runs his own business , was injured during a race in @entity46 in july 2011			1
he was clipped by another rider travelling around 80mph and his fingers got caught in the brake disc of his bike			2
the hardy racer said he calmly picked up his fingers off the track and waited for help			2
' the marshal came and nearly fainted looking at my hand , ' he said			2
' there was n't much pain			2
i was more in discomfort from a dislocated shoulder			0
' doctors attempted to reattach his index finger in hospital , but had to remove it again after it refused to take even with treatment with leeches			0
then that november he was told about a possible toe transplant and he went under the knife at the @entity73 in march 2012			2
mr @entity7 pictured on the day of the accident with his daughter @entity75			1
he told her his fingers would grow back mr @entity7 lost three fingers ( left ) in the smash			1
he now has two toes acting as replacements ( right ) mr @entity7 said : ' to start with their was n't much pain but as the recovery goes on the more the nerves knit and the more pain you get because you are getting more sensation			1
' when the bandages come off you still recognise them as your toes and they are never really going to look like your fingers , although a lot of people do comment how well it looks			2
' i 'm still self - conscious with it but we have done it for function , that 's the main objective			2
' a toe transplant is a potential treatment for someone who has a number of fingers missing			1
the most commonly transplanted toe is the second toe as it is the longest and has joints , a nail , sensitive pulp tissue and a reliable blood supply			2
the foot is repaired by closing the gap between the third and the big toe , leaving a scar			1
one second toe can be taken from each foot with very little effect on the function and appearance of it			1
when each toe is transferred its blood vessels must be successfully joined to similar vessels in the hand for it to survive			1
this part of the operation is performed under an operating microscope			2
tendons ( to allow movement where required ) and nerves ( to allow feeling ) and the bone must also be rejoined to their counterparts in the hand			2
the bone is usually held together with fine pins while it heals			0
these are usually withdrawn 3 - 6 weeks after the op. after the transplant the arm is immobilised with a plaster splint			2
this is left for three weeks before the dressing is changed			0
feeling gradually returns to the nerves over around 12 weeks , often creating a pins - and - needles sensation			1
after this the splint can be worn less and less			0
stretches help the joints to recover			0
source : @entity151 he added that his wife @entity153 and three daughters @entity155 , eight , @entity156 , six and @entity75 , four , were all happy with his new hand			0
' now with the new fingers i can hold a pint glass properly , which is great			0
little things like that are taken for granted but i can enjoy a drink , hold a laptop without dropping it , hold a bottle , ' he said			0
' my feet were fine as well			0
it was n't just the toe but they cut into the foot they needed skin for my hand			1
the feet been narrowed in effect			0
' @entity177 is a real passion for me and now with the transplant that is the goal			0
i would like to be track daying by the start of next year			0
' he was treated by prof @entity183 , who carried out the @entity185 's first hand transplant on @entity186 in december			0
prof @entity187 , seen as a pioneer in his field , used the toe next to the big toe from each of @entity7 ' feet , providing him with large enough digit substitutes without causing him problems with balance			1
the professor usually carries out the procedure on babies and very young children and says adult patients are very rare			0
he said : ' people think that if you 're operating on youngsters it 's more tricky because they 're small			0
but it 's not , if anything it 's more difficult working with the size of an adult 's body			0
' in the case of @entity7 he was a great patient because he has the right personality - he does n't want to be dramatic or make a big fuss , he just wants to sort himself out and get on with his life.the procedure involves re-attaching the bone , nerves , arteries , tendons , ligaments and skin of the toe to the hand			1
however , prof @entity187 said : ' it was n't really complicated surgery			0
for me and my amazing team , it was relatively straight - forward			0
' the operation gives you some feeling , some movement , some power			0
we are n't trying to create something beautiful , we 're trying to create something functional			0
' mr @entity7 said his children were particularly relieved by the outcome			2
' when i first had the accident we initially told my youngest daughter my fingers would grow back , ' he said			0
' since i 've had the toes sewn onto my hand she thinks that 's exactly what happened - and we are n't about to tell her any different			1
' mr @entity7 ( right ) racing his motorbike on the day of the accident			1
he said he did n't care that his new hand was n't the ' prettiest of things ' as it worked mr @entity7 is determined to start riding again			1

@entity7 lost three fingers during a motorbike race in @entity46
the toe next to big toe on each foot was removed and attached to his right hand in 12 - hour operation last year
' they are n't the prettiest of things but i do n't really care , ' says 31 - year - old
