@entity0 knocked out bitter rival @entity1 with a lethal right hand in the eighth round , then set his sights on a title defence in @entity6 next			1
there was talk of @entity0 hanging up his gloves after this hugely anticipated rematch with @entity1 , but straight after victory – which put to bed any of the question marks from the controversial stoppage of @entity1 in their last bout – he was already talking of fighting on			1
' i 'd love to box in @entity6 , ' @entity0 , 36 , declared			1
' it ticks a special box for me			1
i 've fought in @entity19 a few times but @entity6 is the fight capital and it 's something i 've never done			1
my kids will look back on this , they 'll say that was my daddy and he defended world title			2
this evening will never be topped			0
' but i 'd like to fight in vegas			2
the opponent ? who knows ? i 'll leave that up to @entity43			0
' i have defended my world title 13 times on the spin			0
i am amongst the elite			0
and i showed that against @entity1			1
' the finish showed why i mix it with the elite and how hard it is to get to that level			0
' the finish was incredible			0
@entity1 was arguably ahead on points in the fight until the eighth round when @entity0 landed one of the punches of his career			1
he first padded @entity1 's right cheek with a left jab then hurled his right fist with unstoppable fury to take the @entity64 out			2
painful : @entity0 fought @entity65 in @entity66 back in 2011 @entity1 buckled and his left leg bent awkwardly underneath			1
the referee did not even need to count him out			0
' i had been working on that right hand for three months , ' @entity0 added			2
we had a game plan and it was executed perfectly			0
' @entity74 is now the mandatory challenger after defeating @entity75 , but @entity0 will take a break before deciding who to face next			2
@entity1 , who suffered the second defeat of his young career , vowed to come back and keep fighting			2
' i 'd love to come again , ' the 26 - year - old said			1
' i think i was ahead on the score card until that point			0
' i 'll be pushing hard to get my world title fight and maybe if @entity0 is still boxing it 'll be @entity0 again			1
' i 'm young enough and i will come again , i will learn and improve			0
' i made a mistake , a silly mistake , left my chin open			0
we want to be perfect , all the imperfections need to be perfected			0
' fairytale stuff : 36 - year - old @entity0 may be targetting a last hurrah in @entity6			1
