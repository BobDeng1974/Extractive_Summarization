a father who tried to get a restraining order after he discovered footage of his son 's mother screaming at their young boy - has had his case thrown out of court			1
@entity9 was horrified when he discovered the shocking video on his son 's @entity11			1
it shows a woman in her mid-twenties - said to be the boy 's mother - recording herself singing along to a track while her sons play in the background			1
her shouts are punctuated by several ' smacking ' sounds , which mr @entity9 claims was the mother hitting the children			1
the concerned father posted the video on @entity37 and wrote : ' i found this video on my son 's i pad that was obviously recorded by his mother			1
i apologize for the horrible singing , but watch and listen after the 1 minute mark			2
' you will hear her smacking my son and her other son , and the @entity50 awful things she screams at my poor son , ' he added in the @entity37 post			0
' my son watched this with me and he was terrified his mother would find out i watched this and that he would be hit again			1
he said she hits him when she is mad			0
nobody 's kid deserves this			0
' mr @entity9 , believed to be from @entity61 , @entity62 , had taken the footage to @entity64 , in @entity65 in an attempt to get a restraining order			1
but he says judges refused and the young boy was sent back to his mother because they agreed that her household was more ' stable ' as she was married			2
suddenly the woman is distracted from her singing after one of her two children , heard playing in the background , spills milk ' she argued in trial that her house is the more stable household because she would be at home all the time and they would be around her husband because it was highly unlikely he 'd get sent away from @entity85 , ' he wrote on @entity37			2
' i knew she was like this , i just could n't convince a judge			0
' in the video , the mother , seems to become angry after her one of her children spilled some milk			2
she stops singing blown away , by @entity94 , takes the headphones out of her ear , and walks off camera			0
she is then heard shouting : ' get over here			1
' go clean it up			0
' i am a single parent , i do n't have a daddy to help me , it 's just you two			0
clean it up , with that			0
go clean up the milk and you go help him			0
' you spoiled brats , go clean up the milk			0
' mr @entity9 added that the reason the woman , based in @entity111 , shouts she is a single parent was because her husband was often away			1
the video was originally posted to @entity116 on january 5 , and it was later uploaded to @entity117 and has since received over 2 million views			0
mr @entity9 has also made a report to @entity120 but he says they were unwilling to act as there were no bruises visible on the children or other supporting evidence			1
looking annoyed she walks off camera and is then heard screaming at the youngsters			2
