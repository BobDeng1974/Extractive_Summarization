@entity0 will of course be powered by the sun but their transformation from a family company 's environmentalist dream to mainstream reality is being made possible with people power			2
the technology is a long - term brainchild of @entity9 and @entity10 , who have almost doubled their original goal of us $ 1million through crowdfunding site @entity13 to take their project to the next level and build a prototype car park			1
with social media support from celebrities such as @entity21 , @entity0 ' technology replaces standard asphalt roads and parking spaces with high - tech solar panels that generate power , form versatile lighting patterns and even melt snow			2
there 's still 14 days of the fundraising campaign to go but the last count was $ 1,975,577 ( Â£ 1,175,589 ) , way over their original target - and the support is n't just financial with their @entity13 site and related videos going viral and attracting about 15 million views			1
they say the glass in the modular pavers that shield the solar panels can withstand the weight of the mightiest of trucks ( think 250,000 pounds ) but would n't just be suitable for roads - their dream is to see them on any surface we drive or walk on , from footpaths and driveways to playgrounds			0
the heating elements in the panels can keep roads free of ice and snow while they 've been equipped with lighting systems that can form road markings or define parking spaces			0
not stopping there , they 've included a cable corridor that treats storm water and space to run cables that may otherwise have needed to be buried underground or propped up overhead			0
@entity0 estimates there is about 31,000 square miles ( 80,000 square kilometres ) of usable road surfaces in the @entity59 that could be converted into solar - powered roads			0
smart cells : @entity9 and @entity10 aim to have their recycled glass and solar panel cells covering any surface we can walk or drive on ( artist 's illustration ) light it up : leds within the panels can change colour and pattern to be adaptable for a range of uses - from marking parking spaces to warning drivers of an accident ahead hot idea : a heating element within the panels makes them resistant to ice and snow			1

@entity0 is the brainchild of @entity58 couple @entity9 and @entity10
it uses layered *hexagons* *embedded* with solar cells and other *circuitry*
they 've raised $ 1,975,577 through public donations via @entity13
their target for the *production* of a prototype car park was us $ 1m
the cells can *provide* power to *neighbourhoods* and *electric* cars
leds within the panels can also be lit to make the surface into smart roads
these could give drivers *instructions* such as warning them of *hazards*
