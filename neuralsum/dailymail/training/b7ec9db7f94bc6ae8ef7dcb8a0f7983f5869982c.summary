@entity0 has sparked outrage among consumers following its announcement that two racially diverse dolls from its historical range will be ' retired ' - forcing the company to defend their decision			1
' @entity8 ' , of @entity10 descent and ' @entity11 ' , who is @entity12 , will join two @entity14 dolls in being discontinued - a blow to the hoard of consumers who feel there now wo n't be enough racial diversity in the range			1
the company was forced to defend its decision in a statement , claiming that it was a business decision and it is simply doing away with dolls that come in pairs			1
the chop ! four dolls from @entity0 's ' @entity31 ' range have been discontinued , including one african - american and one @entity12 ( pictured right ) , much to the disappointment of many customers @entity0 pr @entity35 told @entity37 : ' we ’ve decided to move away from the friend - character strategy '			1
both african - american @entity8 and @entity40 happen to be in pairs , as do @entity43 @entity42 and @entity44 , which is allegedly why they are being discontinued			1
@entity0 first announced their plans on @entity48 last week			2
' soon , we ’ll say farewell to @entity42 , @entity50 , @entity44 , and @entity11			0
complete your collection while supplies last - quantities are extremely limited ' the statement reads			0
more than 1,100 @entity48 comments flooded in following the news			0
the current cast : @entity0 is doing away with the friendship pairs ( pictured ) which happen to include two racially diverse dolls , insisting this is the only reason they are being retired , not because of their ethnicity ' i guess @entity66 are no longer an important demographic to the @entity0 company ' , complained one user			1
' that would suck if you retire @entity72 next			0
she is the only @entity10 doll left ' , mused another			2
a closer inspection of the new changes however , reveals that some could be jumping to conclusions too quickly			0
the company 's historical range , which celebrates various periods of @entity10 history , currently features 11 dolls , all priced at $ 110 each			1
five of the dolls are from ethnic minorities , and six are @entity14 - a reasonably equal spread			2
blondes : @entity0 has also been criticized for favoring the blonde dolls in its collection , none of which ( pictured , @entity93 , @entity94 and kit ) were retired in the company 's latest shake - up to the range @entity0 's new shake - up will leave seven dolls in the collection , four @entity43 and three dolls of ethnic minority ; @entity106 , who is @entity107 ( @entity108 ) , @entity109 , who is @entity111 , and @entity72 , who is @entity10			1
' @entity11 and @entity8 are the first two racially diverse characters to be archived out of nine in total since 2008 ' the company has n't yet announced details of the new dolls which will be added to replace the four retired ones , except for the news that it will be re-introducing @entity120 , one of the original , @entity14 characters			2
ms @entity35 , further explains that the company 's decision to stop manufacturing four of the dolls has nothing to do with their appearances or ethnicity			2
' @entity0 has been archiving dolls from the historical collection since 2008 , and the first seven dolls that we archived were @entity14 , ' she says			1
' @entity11 and @entity8 are the first two racially diverse characters to be archived out of nine in total since 2008			0
' three remain : @entity106 ( left ) is @entity108 , @entity133 ( center ) is @entity111 and @entity106 ( right ) is @entity10 , and they will all remain in the collection , alongside four @entity14 characters history : @entity72 ( pictured ) became the first @entity10 - @entity10 doll to join the collection , in 1993 , and will remain in the range one of @entity48 's many commentators took issue with this branding decision , referring to the soon - to - be extinct bff 's @entity42 and @entity8			1
' this was a beautiful inter racial friendship ...			0
i loved it for that very reason			0
it is great for breaking down racism , ' the comment reads			0
' i 'm tired of the " diversity of blondes " and pepto - puke - pink clothes			0
if i wanted that for girls in my life , i 'd just buy a @entity159 ' upon studying the collection , we can see that if @entity0 is guilty of favoring any specific characteristics over others , it appears to be its hair color preferences			2
all three blonde dolls from the historical range avoided an early retirement , while the two @entity43 to be discontinued are both brunette			1
' [ i 'm ] tired of the " diversity of blondes " and pepto - puke - pink clothes			0
if i wanted that for girls in my life , i 'd just buy a @entity159 , ' rants one commenter			0
' i 'm just sick of blonde doll after blonde doll when human hair comes in so many amazing colors ... toys should reflect that , ' writes another			0
choices , choices : @entity0 is most popular for its ' create your own doll ' service , which allows customers to purchase dolls with whichever features they want it 's not the first time @entity0 , which has sold more than 23 million dolls since its launch in 1986 , has faced angry complaints			2
when @entity72 , the company 's first @entity10 historical character , was initially portrayed as a slave , there was resounding disapproval			1
and in 2005 , @entity198 and pro-life groups criticized the company for donating funds to an organization which promotes abortion rights and acceptance of homosexuality			0
still , let 's not forget that @entity0 's main attraction remains its ' create your own doll ' service , which allows customers to build a doll with whatever features they desire .			1

four dolls will be ' retired ' from @entity0 's historical range , two @entity43 , one african - american and one @entity12 - @entity10
