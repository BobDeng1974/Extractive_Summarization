when @entity1 was announced as the face of the new issue of fashion bible love magazine , complete with edgy bleached brows , it signaled the end of her transformation from super eek to super chic			1
the metamorphosis has been no mean feat , for while she might now be a firm favourite with designers , @entity1 's initial foray into the fashion world was much more humble - as a stylist for none other than @entity17 and @entity18			1
in fact , a pre-fame @entity1 also worked as a personal shopper and she would regularly be dispatched to pick out new outfits for the the heiress and troubled film star			0
it signals the end of her transition from lowly stylist to fashion favourite , that included a @entity34 cover and the announcement of an ad campaign for @entity37 battle of the brows : @entity1 posed with @entity39 last year shortly after the shoot had taken place it was n't just her lack of a-list quality that forced @entity1 into the fashion doldrums though , despite her day job , back in the mid-noughties , her personal style left a lot to be desired			1
from bright gold dresses to garish satin , she rarely made a ' best - dressed ' list in the early part of her career			2
but fast forward nearly ten years and it 's a completely different story			2
to say @entity1 has become a darling in the fashion world would be somewhat of an understatement - in recent @entity57 she has been front row in @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			1
not only that , she and her husband @entity63 were recently revealed as the new faces of @entity37 and she counts @entity66 's creative director @entity65 as a close personal friend			1
it has n't been an easy transition though , for a long time @entity1 was shunned by the designers who now adore her			2
just over two years ago , during a photoshoot for @entity73 at the end of 2012 , many designers refused to lend their clothes to the reality star			0
pals with @entity59 : before she found global fame , @entity1 worked as @entity17 's stylist and personal shopper			1
she also worked with @entity18 not her best : @entity1 was never known for her fashion choices and her previous wardrobe contained a number of garish outfits what @entity63 says goes : in 2012 @entity63 cleared out @entity1 's wardrobe and gave a complete image overhaul @entity88 , artistic director at @entity89 , styled the shoot and revealed at the time that calling in high - end samples was a ' challenge			1
' he said : ' people would n’t lend me the clothes			0
but that ’s fashion snobbery			2
' @entity88 , who is now good friends with @entity1 , revealed that the top designers did n't want their designs featured on a woman who had , ' less - than - model - like - proportions			2
' however , he rightfully predicted at the time , ' she 's not the it girl yet , but she will be			0
' stylish couple : @entity1 and @entity63 are regulars at @entity110 of course , her new husband @entity63 has played a large part in her style transformation			0
@entity1 has spoken on many an occasion about the rapper - come - designer 's influence over her wardrobe choices			1
in one episode of @entity119 , @entity63 is even seen clearing out her closet to make way for a sleeker look			0
and it seemed his help worked - just under a year after the @entity73 shoot and @entity1 , who was heavily pregnant with @entity127 at the time , showed the first signs of being ingratiated into the fashion world			1
she was asked by @entity131 , the former editor of @entity34 , to cover her @entity133 book			1
@entity1 was photographed for the cover picture by @entity136 's @entity135 and the shoot was art directed by @entity65			2
pretty and pregnant : @entity1 looking stunning in a shoot for @entity131 blooming lovely : @entity1 posed pregnant for @entity135 , with @entity131 describing her as the best model friends : @entity1 and @entity131 share a laugh on the set of @entity1 's big shoot it was a controversial choice at the time , but that worked in @entity1 's favour , as @entity131 later explained to @entity148			0
she said : ' she ’s controversial , but so was @entity149 and i always like controversial people			0
' she went on to praise the reality star , saying : ' she was brave			0
' she had one guy for hair , one guy for make - up – no extensions or lashes – and for her it must have been like being naked , and she accepted everything			0
' i do n’t think normally she would wear those sort of clothes – i ’ve never seen her in a @entity164 jumpsuit or a basketball jacket , but she said yes to everything			0
' she was the easiest model we ’ve had			0
and when we put a mask on her face , she did n’t say anything			0
' oh baby : when @entity127 was born @entity1 took to @entity173 to show the clothes she had been gifted for @entity127 including items from @entity176 and @entity177 wonderful in white : @entity179 gifted @entity127 this white outfit it was following @entity127 's birth in 2013 that it became clear just how popular @entity1 was becoming with the world 's biggest fashion houses though , from the flood of designers sent clothes for her new arrival , all duly documented on @entity1 's instagram page			2
from @entity66 to @entity191 and @entity179 to @entity177 , @entity1 shared photographs of @entity127 's adorable new wardrobe , signaling to the world that the fashion supremos were finally beginning to accept her			2
the biggest coup came in april 2014 though , when she and @entity63 landed a joint @entity34 cover ahead of their may wedding			1
their first big cover : @entity1 and @entity63 covered the april 2014 issue of @entity34 having won the approval of editor @entity204 fashionable family : @entity1 and @entity63 took @entity127 to the @entity206 in september 2014 with @entity1 choosing to dress their daughter in an outfit matching hers the news caused outrage among some of the magazine 's subscribers , but the edition went on to be one of the biggest sellers of the year			1
that magazine sold 500,000 copies , beating both @entity221 and @entity223 's @entity34 covers			1
@entity204 said of the cover : ' part of the pleasure of editing @entity34 , one that lies in a long tradition of this magazine , is being able to feature those who define the culture at any given moment , who stir things up , whose presence in the world shapes the way it looks and influences the way we see it			1
' i think we can all agree on the fact that that role is currently being played by @entity1 and @entity63 to a @entity244 ' as for the cover , my opinion is that it is both charming and touching , and it was , i should add , entirely our idea to do it ; you may have read that @entity63 begged me to put his fiancée on @entity34 's cover			1
' he did nothing of the sort			0
the gossip might make better reading , but the simple fact of the matter is that it is n't true			0
' since then , @entity1 has sat from row ( with @entity127 in tow ) at some of the biggest shows at fashion week			0
she also became part of @entity266 's @entity37 army , later posing as a model for him			1
@entity1 now counts designers like @entity135 and @entity270 as friends and is regularly pictured on nights out with supermodels like @entity274 and @entity39			0
it truly seems that @entity88 's prediction has come true ... @entity1 has become the ultimate fashion it girl .			2

the 34 - year - old is on the new cover of @entity27 's @entity284 magazine
the move marks her transition from lowly stylist to fashion favourite
