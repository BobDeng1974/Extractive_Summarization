comedian @entity0 has blamed his troubled relationship with his late mother for his years of therapy and four marriages			1
the @entity6 star , who married his fourth wife @entity7 in 2012 , said his mother @entity8 had ' utterly egotistical impulses ' and that he lacked any affection for her during his childhood			1

they had one child together , but had divorced by the time the second series aired			2
@entity0 's second marriage , to @entity24 , lasted nine years , with the couple remaining friends after their split in 1990			1
he then wed @entity28 , a marriage he reportedly told close friend @entity30 he regretted , but nonetheless they stayed together for 16 years			1

' it is said you should n't speak ill of the dead but it seems to me an ideal opportunity , ' he said			0
' i do n't want to get too dark and depressing but she was emotionally difficult			0
' in an extract of his new autobiography , so , anyway , published in the magazine , he wrote : ' it can not be a coincidence that i spent such a large part of my life in some form of therapy and that the vast majority of the problems i was dealing with involved relationships with women			0
' my ingrained habit of walking on eggshells when dealing with my mother dominated my romantic liaisons for many years			2
' @entity0 had a child with each of his first two wives , @entity19 ( left ) and @entity24 ( right ) @entity0 was married to @entity28 ( left ) for 16 years , but has since married @entity7 , who is 31 years his junior , at a ceremony in the @entity68 @entity0 's divorces took their toll on the comedian 's finances too , with £ 12.5m reportedly paid out to ms @entity28 after their split			1

meanwhile , despite the success of a string of sell - out comeback shows at @entity91 's @entity90 in july , @entity0 admitted he felt ' no trace of excitement ' by the second show of their 10 - night run			0
' it was only our second night , ' he said			0
' i was waiting to start a sketch and a few seconds before the spotlight turned on me , i could see the huge packed arena and i felt no trace of excitement			0
' if you 're standing in front of 6,000 people and you 're thinking " this is perfectly pleasant but i 'm not in the slightest bit excited " , then @entity110 , or possibly @entity111 , is sending you a message that maybe you should be doing something else			0
