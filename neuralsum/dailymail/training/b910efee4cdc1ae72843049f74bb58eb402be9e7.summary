manufacturer @entity0 says they have been ' inundated ' with requests by @entity3 and @entity4 published : 05:38 est , 3 november 2013 updated : 05:34 est , 4 november 2013 councils are using cctv - style cameras to catch parents who park illegally when dropping off or picking up pupils from school			1
the cameras are timed to switch on during the school run and zoom in on the number plates of parents who stop in restricted zones			1
they then record footage of the registration number and parking sign and send it as a ‘ video and data package ’ to councils			1
@entity22 : parents on the school run will be hit with fines from @entity7 - style cameras that are currently being trailed by councils across the country ( library image ) this information can help local authorities issue fines of up to £ 120 to families who stop outside schools to let their children out			1
the surveillance system is being made available to councils across the country for £ 16,000 by the manufacturer @entity0 , which specialises in traffic management			1
bosses at the firm say five councils in @entity42 and at least two others outside the capital are testing the system , but refused to say which they were			1
surveillance : @entity7 - style cameras , similar to this one in @entity42 , are to be trialled by several councils across the country the firm says it developed the system after being approached by a council concerned about the safety of pupils in the chaos outside school gates			1
according to insurance industry figures , more than 1,000 children a month are injured on roads around @entity62 schools			2
@entity63 , a @entity0 director , said : ‘ head teachers had been complaining about the parking outside their schools and worrying about the safety of children			2
‘ since the first trials started over the summer we have been inundated with requests from other councils across the country asking about the system			1
’ yesterday , @entity75 confirmed that it had launched a pilot of the technology but said it was too early to decide whether to buy it			0
the system has angered motoring campaigners , who said it would give councils another chance to use parents as cash cows			2
@entity87 , the general secretary of the @entity88 , claimed the cameras were illegal because government guidance said they should not be used routinely			0
the @entity93 actor @entity92 , 71 , who drops his grandchild off at school in @entity42 , compared the camera system to surveillance by the @entity98			1
he said : ‘ the councils are doing this for revenue			0
to target parents is frankly disgusting			0
’ mr @entity63 said his system was three times cheaper than camera cars , which were often used to police school parking			2
alternative : director of manufacturer @entity108 insists the cameras will be cheaper than ' camera cars ' , pictured , which are often used to police school parking he told @entity114 : ‘ our system can be fixed to existing street furniture and programmed to look for specific school-gate offences such as parking on a zigzag line for more than three seconds			1
’ anger : @entity122 has hit out at councils who were using parking enforcement powers as a ' cash cow ' instead of a way to curb crime it comes after a number of ‘ lollipop rage ’ incidents outside schools , where parents have become involved in disputes about parking and other issues			2
according to the @entity139 , there were 7,000 such incidents in 2011 , up from 1,400 in 2008			0
but @entity142 guidance says @entity7 should only be used to enforce parking rules when it is impractical to use traffic wardens			0
when @entity7 is used , drivers only find out they have been caught when a fixed penalty ticket drops through their letter box some time later , making it harder to challenge the fine			0
@entity151 , local government minister said : ' the law is clear			0
parking is not a tax or cash cow for local councils			0
this government wants to rein in over-zealous parking enforcement , including stopping the use of @entity7 spy cameras for parking , so it focuses on supporting sensible drivers , not raising money			0
' public confidence is strengthened in @entity7 if it is used to tackle serious crime , not to raise money for council coffers by penalising parents dropping off kids on the school run			1
' councils are on track to make £ 635million profit from parking this year - with income from fines and penalties alone topping £ 340million			1
earlier this year , @entity122 hit out at councils who were using parking enforcement powers as a ‘ cash cow ’ instead of a way to curb crime			0
the @entity183 said that councils using parking to supplement their income were acting ‘ outside the law ’ and should be stopped			0
he said : ‘ we are worried that what is happening in local authorities is they are using parking fines as a kind of a cash cow from motorists			2
the legislation is very clear , you can not do so			0
