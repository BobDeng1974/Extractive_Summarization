the last surviving rescue dog who searched @entity2 for survivors and lifted the spirits of devastated first responders has returned to the site on the 13th anniversary of the tragedy			1
@entity9 , a 15 - year - old golden retriever , was just two when she and her owner , @entity11 , were sent from @entity12 to relieve search teams in @entity14 - on what was their first ever deployment			1
this week , @entity11 and @entity9 , which is pronounced ' @entity19 ' , returned to the @entity21 site for the first time since 2001			1
' seeing this kind of took my breath away a bit , similar to how the pile was the first time i saw it , ' @entity11 , 49 , told the @entity29			2
' it 's so calm and peaceful now , unlike the chaos of before			0
it is the first time she and her handler , who live in @entity12 , have been back team : owner and handler @entity11 is pictured with @entity9 at @entity2 in @entity14 in 2001 the duo , from @entity44 , @entity12 , were sent to the site to take over from the first wave of first responders a week after the terrorist attacks took nearly 3,000 lives			1
they knew it was unlikely they would find anyone alive , but @entity11 was still hopeful			0
' i really believed we could find somebody - anybody - if we could just get to the right void space , ' she told today			0
' but our reality was much different			0
we found all various kinds of remains , some recognizable , others not so much			0
' it was their job to search an area of debris for survivors and once they were confident no one was there , they gave crews permission to clear that area of debris			2
tired out : @entity11 and @entity9 were sent to @entity2 a week after the attacks and worked 12 - hour days taking a break : the team stop for a nap amid the rubble during their search in september 2001 but they quickly realized @entity9 also had other roles to fill as they worked 12 - hour shifts for two weeks			1
in one instance , @entity9 ran away from her owner and over to a firefighter sitting sadly on the ground - and even when @entity11 tried to get her to return , she refused			1
' i was surprised that she was n't listening to me , but she really was n't - it was like she was flipping me the paw , ' @entity11 said			2
' she went right to that firefighter and laid down next to him and put her head on his lap. ' often , as the duo sat waiting for their next task , first responders would approach @entity9 and pet her and share their stories			0
' it became an unexpected role of a therapy dog , ' @entity11 said on the today show			0
@entity11 agrees , too , that @entity9 - her best friend - has been there for her over the years			1
return : @entity11 spoke to the @entity29 's @entity98 after visiting the site ahead of the 13th anniversary she said her breath was taken away with how peaceful and quiet the site is now , unlike the chaos of 2001 by her side : @entity9 , who also sat in on the today interview , is older but no less energetic , @entity11 said emotional : they are seen visiting the pools at the memorial , where 13 years ago they searched for victims they first started working together after @entity11 , an electrical engineer , became interested in the work of disaster search dogs and looked into getting involved			1
she learned that civilians can train their own dogs and , as long as they pass tests , they can support federal emergency response teams when disasters strike in the @entity118 in 1999 , she took in eight - week - old @entity9 and got to work with her right away			2
she told the today show that it took between 20 and 30 hours of rigorous training every week - which she did when she was n't working - and in 2000 , they qualified to join @entity123 1			0
after helping in the aftermath of 9/11 , they were also deployed to sites , including @entity127			0
@entity9 retired from searches at age nine , but she still enjoys working as a service dog in a local elementary school , where she helps children with special needs read out loud			2
heroic : after 9/11 - which was their first assignment - @entity11 and @entity9 helped after @entity127 new job : @entity9 retired for searches when she turned nine but she now works as a service dog in schools giving them confidence : she works with children at elementary schools to help them learn how to read aloud ' she still has this attitude of putting her paw up and saying , " put me in , coach ! " ' @entity11 said			1
' she absolutely loves it			0
' @entity9 is now one of eight finalists for the @entity150 's annual @entity149 and will be traveling to @entity151 for the award ceremony in late september			1
there is believed to be one other surviving search dog from 9/11 , a 15 - year - old @entity156 springer spaniel named @entity157 , who worked on @entity159			1
