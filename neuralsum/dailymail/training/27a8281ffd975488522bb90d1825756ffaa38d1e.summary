@entity0 is investigating one of its executives over allegations that he tracked a reporter without her knowledge , according to a recent report			2
@entity8 claims that @entity9 , @entity0 's @entity10 general manager , tracked technology reporter @entity11 on two occasions using a feature known as ' @entity14 '			1
@entity14 is available to all employees at the car - sharing service and allows them to see customer activity , such as where a person wants to be picked up			1
pictured right is the @entity0 app the allegation , which @entity8 claims came from two former @entity0 employees , follows a meeting in november at @entity0 's @entity10 headquarters			1
according to the news site , when ms @entity11 arrived at the meeting , mr @entity9 said : ' there you are â€¦ i was tracking you			1
' however , ms @entity11 had never granted permission for mr @entity9 to follow her using the tool			1
two months earlier , ms @entity11 had asked about competitor @entity37 , and mr @entity9 had emailed her logs of some of her @entity0 trips			1
while @entity0 would not comment on the allegation , it is understood that the company is now investigating mr @entity9			1
shocking : @entity44 ( pictured ) , @entity0 's senior vice president , reportedly proposed looking into journalists ' ' personal lives ' and ' families ' while in the presence of a @entity8 editor at a private dinner in @entity10 ' our data privacy policy applies to all employees : access to and use of data is permitted only for legitimate business purposes , ' a spokesperson for @entity0 told @entity60			1
' data security specialists monitor and audit that access on an ongoing basis			0
violations of this policy do result in disciplinary action , including the possibility of termination and legal action			0
' the news follows another incident this week in which a senior executive at @entity0 made a grovelling apology after suggesting putting a team together to dig up dirt on journalists who criticise his company			1
@entity44 , who made the remarks at a private dinner in @entity81 , said he had dreamed up an eight - man team who would find out about writers ' personal lives and families so that @entity0 could discredit them			1
@entity88 : he was speaking with specific reference to @entity90 ( left ) , editor of @entity91 , who recently wrote about deleting her @entity0 app after the firm teamed up with an apparent escort service in @entity95 the scheme was targeted at a particular @entity98 female editor who has savaged the company for its alleged ' sexism and misogyny ' - but drew an outraged backlash when it became public			1
a chorus of disapproval aimed at @entity44 prompted a humiliating public apology to @entity90 , the editor of @entity91 , in which he disowned the idea entirely			1
mr @entity44 posted an apology to @entity90 's @entity110 account , saying : ' i would like to apologise to you directly			2
my comments were wrong and i deeply regret them			0
' neither me [ sic ] nor my company would ever engage in such activities			0
' the remarks will do little to improve @entity0 's fragile relationship with the media following the portrayal of its management team as insensitive and aggressive toward customer complaints			2
venue : during the dinner party at @entity81 's @entity125 ( pictured ) , @entity44 was reportedly asked about the firm 's depictions in the press			2
in response , the executive suggested that @entity0 should consider spending ' a million dollars ' of its reported $ 15billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists , it is claimed under - fire : @entity136 has entered the firestorm surrounding taxi - hiring app @entity0 @entity136 has entered the firestorm surrounding under - fire taxi - hiring app uber and defended controversial comments made by an executive who suggested spending $ 1 million to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize the company			1
@entity136 , an investor in the app , took to @entity110 on wednesday to show his support for beleaguered vp @entity44 and described @entity90 , a female journalist who has been highly critical of the company , as ' shady '			2
' what is so wrong about digging up dirt on shady journalist ? ' tweeted the celebrity tech entrepreneur who has invested in tech firms including @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 through his venture capital firm @entity161			0
so as long as journalist are interested and willing to print half truths as facts ... yes we should question the source ' he continued in a series of tweets before he sought to clarify that he was speaking for himself and not uber			0
' this should be fun ... here comes the part where journalist explain why they should be exempt from ridicule and judgement and probing ... ' he continued			0
and , indeed , the apology did not stop @entity90 from writing a scathing opinion piece on @entity91 , in which she said the plan was ' like a five - year - old pretending to be @entity180 ' - a reference to @entity183 's scheming politician character in @entity186 series @entity184			2
according to ms @entity90 , @entity44 also called her cell phone and ask to speak in private , but hung up after she refused to have an off - the - record conversation			1
mr @entity44 's plan came up when he was asked about the firm 's negative press coverage			0
in response , the executive suggested that @entity0 should consider spending ' a million dollars ' of its reported $ 15 billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists , according to @entity8			1
the eight - strong hit team would investigate ' your personal lives , your families ' with a view to discrediting journalists behind unfavorable reports on the taxi service , he said			2
mr @entity44 was especially focused on ms @entity90 , who also recently accused @entity0 of ' sexism and misogyny ' on her @entity98 website , writing : ' the company simply does n't respect us or prioritize our safety			1
' apology : @entity44 , who used to work at @entity213 and also sits on a board advising the @entity215 , later took to @entity110 to apologize for his comments to @entity90 herself , saying : ' i would like to apologize to you directly ' contradicting his remarks : he added : ' neither me nor my company would ever engage in such activities ' he reportedly expressed anger over her claims that , responding that women are far more likely to suffer assault at the hands of normal taxi drivers than @entity0 drivers			1
in a statement to @entity8 on monday evening , he said he believed he was speaking off the record and that his remarks did not reflect his nor @entity0 's views			2
' the remarks attributed to me at a private dinner - borne out of frustration during an informal debate over what i feel is sensationalistic media coverage of the company i am proud to work for - do not reflect my actual views and have no relation to the company 's views or approach , ' he said			0
' they were wrong no matter the circumstance and i regret them			0
' at no point during the dinner did @entity44 suggest the firm has already hired opposition researchers			2
an @entity0 spokesman confirmed that the company does not carry out such research and has never considered doing it because it would be a ' clear violation of our privacy and data access policies '			0
the event at @entity125 on friday evening was attended by a number of high - profile figures , including actor @entity264 and publisher @entity265			0
