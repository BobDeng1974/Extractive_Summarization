a @entity1 congressional delegation will meet for talks with @entity4 officials on monday in the highest - level contact between the two nations since plans for trade reforms were announced			1
the symbolic meeting between the @entity1 delegation and its old cold war foe will be led by senator @entity12 and could be attended by president @entity13			1
@entity1 delegates are set to tell @entity4 officials that their actions in the coming months will influence @entity17 openness to president @entity19 's plans			1
@entity12 and five other @entity38 senators and representatives are trying to ease the reestablishment of full relations with @entity4 as the two countries hold talks aimed at normalizing trade relations			1
they also want to gauge how @entity13 's government will respond to the @entity1 push to expand diplomatic relations and trade ties			1
however , it is not the first time that @entity12 , who played a key role in the release of @entity1 contractor @entity54 as part of a prisoner exchange , has dealt with the secretive regime			2
he met @entity13 on past trips to @entity4 and was expected to do so again on monday , two days before assistant secretary of state @entity60 arrives in @entity32 to negotiate the reopening of the @entity1 embassy			1
@entity4 has so far offered a guardedly positive reception to @entity19 's loosening of the trade embargo on @entity4 , saying it welcomes the full package of new economic ties on offer			2
@entity1 senator @entity12 is heading the first congressional delegation visit to @entity4 since president @entity19 announced in december plans for renewed economic ties with @entity4 the sweeping reforms could affect sales of telecommunications equipment and exports to the private business sector			1
but it comes after @entity19 defied hardline critics in @entity17 to begin loosening some @entity1 economic sanctions against the communist - ruled island			0
to date , @entity4 has released 53 prisoners on a list of dissidents the @entity1 wanted freed			2
but it has said nothing about whether it will allow @entity1 products to flow to @entity4 without the staggering taxes and regulations that keep many other foreign products from ordinary @entity4			0
it also insists it will maintain its one - party political system and centrally planned economy			0
@entity12 said : ' we are seeing a remarkable change in relations between our countries and we want to talk to some of the @entity4 to see what they think about it , to see what 's going to happen next			1
' ' obviously we hope to have a lot more freedom of expression among @entity4 , but also the ability for our own two countries to talk with each other , something long overdue			0
' with formal diplomatic relations highly restricted , some of the most significant @entity1 - @entity4 contacts in recent years have been carried out by @entity17 delegations			0
@entity19 's actions fall under executive authority and do n't require @entity17 approval			0
but legislators could still hinder key measures including the removal of @entity4 from the list of state sponsors of terror			0
on saturday , the delegation met with officials from @entity4 's @entity122 about possible @entity4 participation in the @entity125 's @entity124 on @entity127 's @entity126			2
the senators met sunday with more than a dozen dissidents including critics of the 18 - month - old secret negotiations that led to last month 's announcement			0
@entity133 who has criticized the @entity19 administration for failing to win enough guarantees of reform from @entity13 said : ' it was a friendly meeting			0
' @entity138 , head of the @entity139 , a @entity4 non-governmental organization tracking political detentions said that meeting participants had delivered a list of 24 long - term prisoners whom they wanted to see released in addition to the 53 on the @entity19 administration 's list			0
on monday , along with the possible meeting with @entity13 , the delegation will hold talks with lower - ranking @entity4 officials in fields like agriculture , the environment and telecommunications .			1
