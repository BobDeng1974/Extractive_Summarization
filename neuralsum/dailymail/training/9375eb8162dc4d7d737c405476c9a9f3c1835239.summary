by @entity0 a businessman has become the first man to have his prostate removed after discovering he was carrying a faulty gene that raises the risk of cancer			1
the 53 - year - old was told he had the rogue @entity9 gene after taking part in a clinical trial at the @entity12 in @entity13			1
last week @entity14 revealed that she had had a double mastectomy after discovering that the @entity17 gene gave her an 87 per cent risk of developing breast cancer			1
scientists believe that other men who know they are carriers will choose to go down the same route ( stock image ) both the @entity9 and @entity17 genes have long been known to increase the risk of breast and ovarian forms of the disease but recent research has also linked them to the prostate			1
the businessman , who has not been identified but is married with children and lives in @entity13 , has other family members who have suffered breast or prostate cancers			1
although his prostate appeared to be perfectly healthy , he was anxious to have it removed to avoid the same fate			0
however , doctors were reluctant to operate because the procedure leaves men infertile and can cause permanent incontinence and sexual dysfunction			0
an mri scan and a prostate - specific antigen test – which detects raised levels of a protein linked to cancer – also showed no sign of defects			1
prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the @entity55 , with over 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year			2
prostate cancer usually develops slowly , so there may be no signs you have prostate cancer for many years			2
symptoms often only become apparent when your prostate is large enough to affect the urethra ( the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis )			0
when this happens , you may notice things like an increased need to urinate , straining while urinating and a feeling your bladder has not fully emptied			2
however , these signs do not mean you have prostate cancer			2
it is more likely they are caused by something else , such as benign prostatic hyperplasia ( also known as @entity77 or prostate enlargement )			0
@entity79 the doctors only agreed when a tissue sample taken from the gland showed microscopic malignant changes which could be the first indication of cancer			2
professor @entity86 , the surgeon who carried out the procedure , said he would still have refused to do it had the patient not also had the faulty @entity9 gene			1
the professor , one of the world ’s leading prostate surgeons , said he is expecting more healthy men to come forward if they discover they are carrying one of the faulty genes			0
‘ the relatively low level of cancerous cells we found in this man ’s prostate before the operation would these days not normally prompt immediate surgery to remove the gland , but given what we now know about the nature of @entity9 , it was definitely the right thing to do for this patient , ’ he said			1
‘ this patient is now absolutely fine			0
a number of these @entity9 families have now been identified , and knowing you are a carrier is like having the sword of @entity113 hanging over you			1
‘ you are living in a state of constant fear			0
i am sure more male brca carriers will now follow suit			0
’ about one in eight men will develop prostate cancer in their lifetime and there are about 41,000 new cases in @entity55 each year			0
the disease causes just under 10,500 deaths annually , but often it is so slow - growing that patients die from another cause first			0
@entity14 chose to have a double mastectomy as her chance of developing breast cancer was very high last month a study of more than 2,000 men by the @entity12 found that men with defective @entity17 or brca2 genes were a third more likely to be diagnosed with late - stage prostate cancer			1
they were twice as likely to have an earlier form of the disease that had spread and tended to live half as long as men without the inherited faulty gene			1
other studies claim affected men are up to four times at risk of cancer			2
hollywood star @entity145 , 37 , wrote an article in the @entity147 last week explaining how she ’d had both breasts removed to reassure her six children the illness would n’t claim her life			0
the @entity153 - winning actress described the heartache of losing her mother @entity155 at the age of 56 after fighting ovarian cancer for almost a decade .			0

businessman had an increased risk of cancer through the @entity9 gene
he entered a trial at @entity12 as it ran in his family
@entity169 and @entity170 genes are linked to an *aggressive* form of cancer
@entity14 had a double mastectomy after testing *positive* for @entity169
