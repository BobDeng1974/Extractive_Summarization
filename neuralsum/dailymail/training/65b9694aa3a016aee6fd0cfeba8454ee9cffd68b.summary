first there was the @entity2 song , then the @entity4 rap and now the @entity5			0
a science teacher from the @entity7 has developed a rather unorthodox way of teaching his students about biology - through the medium of dance			1
dr @entity13 , a science teacher at @entity14 , in @entity15 , choreographed his lessons to music in an attempt to help his pupils remember how a cell works			1
scroll down for more video of dr @entity13 dancing among the dances he has created is the dna boogie - in which he uses dance moves to represent the molecules chemical structure - and the @entity31 , about how chromosomes are shared between cells as tissue grow			1
musicians who want to write a chart - topping song need to move in a different musical direction than the pack , research has revealed			0
more than 25,000 songs on the @entity41 100 from 1958 to 2013 were analysed as part of the study of audio attributes			2
it found the key to a hit song was that it should sound different from anything else in the charts , but not so distant that it puts music fans off			2
@entity55 's number one song @entity53 , @entity56 and @entity58 's @entity57 , and @entity60 's @entity59 , all hit the top spot because they were distinct from other songs around at the time			2
researchers discovered that songs that faltered in the middle of the @entity41 were most likely to sound the same , whilst weird singles failed to make the charts at all			2
dr @entity13 's efforts have earned him a place among ten finalists in line for a $ 1 million ( £ 650,000 ) award , the @entity73			1
the award is designed to highlight the role teachers play in society			0
mr @entity13 said he developed the dances along with songs and role - play as a way to help his pupils understand difficult concepts			1
he said : ' i 'm inspired by music , i 'm inspired by art. if i can find a biology link , i will bring it into the teaching			1
' what i love about teaching is the privilege of working with young people , to fire their passion and reciprocate their energy			0
' the opportunity to be creative and think of different ways of communicating science and the buzz of seeing those " light bulb " moments when challenging topics start to make sense for students and you realise that hours of planning innovative learning experiences were worthwhile			0
' finally , seeing my students develop in confidence and knowing that i have helped to prepare them for future success , way beyond their time with me in the classroom			0
' dr @entity13 has also produced detailed step by step guides to his dances to help other teachers use them in their lessons			1
the @entity120 , for example , aims to convey the biological process of cell division , where cells in growing tissue divide into daughter cells with the same genetic material			0
@entity13 has choreographed a dance all about the structure of dna and the chemicals that make it dr @entity13 has shared his teaching experiences at an education conference with @entity134 at the @entity135 in the dance he gives the pupils different coloured bibs to represent chromosomes while they hold curtain ties to represent the centromeres that bind matching pairs of chromosomes together			1
he also uses different coloured bibs to represent the different chemical building blocks that make up @entity129 , while also designating different moves to the different parts of each of these nucleotides			1
for example a fist pump represents the phosphate that sits at the top of each nucleotide , a body wiggle is the sugar and a point towards the floor is the base			0
it is all performed to the music of @entity161			0
dr @entity13 takes his pupils through the steps for the @entity5 ( above ) to help them learn about biology dr @entity13 's teaching ( above ) has earned him a place among the ten finalists for the @entity168 dr @entity13 will fly to @entity169 for the final award ceremony for the @entity168 on sunday			1
the winner will be judged by a panel including @entity173 , baroness @entity174 , social activist @entity175 , @entity176 , the deputy director of the @entity178 and @entity179 , and @entity180 , chief executive of @entity181			0
@entity182 , principal at @entity14 , said : ' he has fantastic results at a level and as level			2
' but he is not just a good teacher of students but he is a great teacher of teachers			0
it 's that buzz , vibrancy and enthusiasm he has created here that makes him really special			0
' the diagram above show some of the steps dr @entity13 has created to represent @entity120 as a square dance			1

dr @entity13 choreographs his *college* biology lessons to music
the teacher at @entity14 in @entity15 says it ' inspires ' pupils
he uses coloured bibs to represent chromosomes and dna *neucleotides*
he also writes science *lyrics* to *famous* songs like blame it on the boogie
he has now been nominated for the $ *1m* ( £ 650,000 ) @entity73
