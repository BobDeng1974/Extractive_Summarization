as @entity13 revealed , @entity12 chiefs were looking for a male pal for the long - time anchor in a desperate bid to increase ratings			1
and the ailing morning program introduced the budding love affair today , with a bizarre four - minute segment dedicated to @entity21 swatting @entity5 's bottom backstage			1
on the tape , the 9am hour co-host is seen tapping @entity5 on the derriere with a wad of papers			1
the pair then shake hands before @entity5 reciprocates the butt - slap using his hand			1

' since it happened , he has n't called , he has n't written			0
nothing , ' @entity5 said in the tongue - in - cheek report			2
the footage was shown several more times before the segment ended and both @entity10 and @entity5 discussed the incident on the couch with @entity24 and co-anchor @entity66			1
@entity5 has been left without a buddy beyond @entity68 since the departure of his best friend @entity70 from the today show , which has prompted @entity12 chiefs to scout for a new buddy in a bid to boost ratings			1

they also were keen to rival the ' bromance ' between @entity84 and @entity85 on @entity87 's @entity86 , which continues to outdo today in the ratings stakes			1
ahead of the arrival of @entity38 's new executives @entity91 and @entity92 , a source told @entity13 : ' if you look at @entity95 and @entity85 on @entity86 , they are really great friends and that shines through on air - not since @entity5 and @entity70 have we seen chemistry like this on morning tv			1

' another source added : ' there is no chance in hell that @entity5 's getting fired			2
' of course , there are huge issues at today and the big problem will be when the affiliates who pay all the money to air today start complaining about ratings - they 're never afraid to call a spade a spade			0
' every ratings point is worth millions in advertising revenue and today knows it 's not going to win its spot back overnight			0
' we 're waiting to see if @entity92 can do something bold			0

' on @entity86 , people know that @entity85 's getting married , @entity84 talks all the time about his daughter , they 're going through @entity173 ' illness with her and @entity174 just does n't stop talking ! ' in effect , today needs to find its ' secret sauce '			2
