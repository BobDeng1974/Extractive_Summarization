@entity0 have made an enquiry for @entity3 defensive midfielder @entity2			1
the @entity5 man , who missed the @entity6 through injury , is @entity9 's primary midfield target this summer having failed to sign him last summer			1
leverkusen are reluctant to sell @entity2 , 25 , having only recently tied him down to a new long term contract			0
@entity25 's @entity24 and @entity27 midfielder @entity26 are on @entity9 's back - up list if @entity2 can not be signed			1
@entity26 , 27 remains part of @entity31 's plans in @entity32 and the @entity33 will find it hugely difficult to lure him away from the @entity36 champions			0
the 24 - year - old @entity24 , however , is likely to be easier to land and seems a far more realistic signing should their move for @entity2 fail			2
in addition , @entity0 will hope to wrap up moves for @entity44 forward @entity43 and @entity46 defender @entity45 this week , although they may face competition from @entity48 for @entity49 star @entity43			2
fall back : @entity9 may move for @entity26 ( left ) if he ca n't sign @entity2 closer to home : @entity0 are also interested in @entity25 and @entity51 midfielder @entity24 ( left ) @entity52 confirms @entity33 move @entity54 agreed : @entity0 have reached a deal with @entity44 to sign @entity43 for £ 34m moving on : @entity45 arrived back in @entity56 with his @entity58 team - mates after their @entity6 exit @entity0 have agreed a £ 34million deal in principle with @entity44 for @entity49 international forward @entity43 but @entity44 are waiting to see if @entity48 can match the offer			1
@entity43 has indicated he does not want to join @entity63 despite their efforts to persuade him and @entity65 being keen to speak to the player			0
that will mean a straight cash deal for @entity69 from @entity44 .			0

@entity5 midfielder is @entity9 's top midfield target
@entity0 failed in bid to sign @entity2 last summer
@entity24 and @entity26 are fall back *options*
*wenger* hoping to sign @entity43 and @entity45 this week
