@entity34 , a historian specialising in gold and silver decorative arts , recently wrote in his book : ‘ only five sets of silver cards are known today and of these only one — the @entity41 set ( referring to the current owner ) — is complete			1
‘ they were not made for playing with but as works of art for the collector 's cabinet , or @entity48			0
’ creating the silver cards was a hazardous job as each of the 52 cards was gilded using mercury , a deadly chemical , a process which is illegal today			1
even in @entity58 times , people knew the process was dangerous			0
risky process : @entity60 was used to gild the gold to the silver - a process which is illegal today and even in @entity58 times , people knew the process was dangerous mr @entity34 was quoted in @entity65 saying : ‘ i do n't think they quite understood why it was dangerous , but they did appreciate the dangers of it			2
‘ you ground up gold into kind of a dust , and you mix it with mercury , and you painted that onto the surface where you wished the gilding to appear			2
’ he explained that the mercury disperses in the kiln in a process ‘ that would leave the gold chemically bonded to the silver ’			2
in her hands : legend has it that @entity26 princess @entity25 took the set of silver cards with her when she fled to @entity28 as @entity30 's armies marched into @entity31 in 1807 prince @entity90 is thought to have given the silver cards to the wife of @entity94 , a man who helped her try to take the @entity96 crown after @entity30 forced her brother , @entity97 , to abdicate			1
