by @entity0 this is the heart - stopping moment a daredevil loses his balance on a sky - high building – and nearly falls to his death			1
the man , a 24 - year - old called @entity8 , is filmed doing a backflip but instead of landing squarely on his feet , his left foot misses the platform and he almost falls 150 metres to the ground below			1
but rather than crying over the close shave @entity8 - who performed the stunt in @entity15 , @entity16 - laughs it off			1
and this is n’t his first brush with death			2
the man suffered concussion after flipping off a wall and landing on his head , and another time he broke his leg performing a stunt			2
and a well - known member of the parkour community , the @entity29 @entity28 , died last year after performing the very same backflip on a 16 - storey building			1
@entity34 is a sport which developed from military obstacle training and involves getting from a to b in the most efficient way possible – without the use of safety equipment			0
daredevil : @entity8 , 24 , stands atop a building in @entity15 , @entity16			1
he is practicing parkour , a sport which involves climbing buildings with no safety equipment admiring the view : @entity8 stands on a crane and takes in the sights over @entity15 , @entity16 @entity8 , who works in surveying , said : ‘ i was scared , but fears keeps you from death			1
but with that , i feel great and ready to make the next flip			0
’ ‘ @entity34 is dangerous but life is dangerous			0
‘ there is a @entity58 saying – we do not know what will come before – tomorrow or new life			0
‘ in parkour you overcome the obstacles – both physically and mentally			0
’ hanging in there : @entity8 risks his life climbing buildings with no safety equipment			2
in the past he has broken his leg and suffered concussion after landing on his head in pole position : @entity8 walks across a pole between highrise buildings monkey bars : @entity8 makes his way to the end of a crane overlooking the city			2
he does n't wear a harness , meaning one slip and he falls to his death			0
but he 's philosophical about it , saying life is dangerous too			0
