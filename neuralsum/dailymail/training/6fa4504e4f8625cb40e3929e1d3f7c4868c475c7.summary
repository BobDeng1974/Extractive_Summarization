most people have a favourite list of songs they use to motivate themselves before a sports game or during a workout , but is there any science behind this idea ? according to new research it turns out there is - music truly does make us feel powerful , but not all songs have the same effect			1
researchers found some music empowers you to do great things , and levels of bass are a key factor in its effectiveness			1
@entity25 based researchers have found music makes us feel powerful			1
they found certain songs could make people work and exercise harder ( stock image shown ) ' when watching major sports events , my coauthors and i frequently noticed athletes with their earphones on while entering the stadium and in the locker room , ' says dr @entity37 of the @entity38 at @entity39 in @entity25			1
in previous research by the @entity42 at @entity43 in @entity44 and @entity45 scientists analysed 6.7 million @entity45 playlists containing the word ‘ workout ’ in the title to compare the different beats per minute ( bpm ) and compile the ultimate playlist			0
a person ’s typical stride rate while jogging or running is 150 to 190 strides per minute			0
if these figures are halved it gives a range of 75 to 95 bpm - the beat range most commonly used in urban music , particularly rap			2
whereas pop is perfect for slower , more repetitive - type tasks , including aerobic warm up and cool down because many pop songs ' have regular rhythmic patterns			0
' dance music is best suited to strength and weight training because of its ‘ fast , rhythmical , bass ’			0
whereas rock music should be avoid during cardio and high - intensity workouts because the different changes in tempo can affect a person ’s rhythm			1
' the ways these athletes immerse themselves in the music - some with their eyes steely shut and some gently nodded along the beats - seem as if the music is mentally preparing and toughening them up for the competition about to occur			0
' these observations got dr @entity37 and his colleagues curious as to whether music can truly transform the psychological state of the listener			0
previous research has established that music can have positive effects on people , ranging from enhancing learning and motivation to reducing physical pain			0
however , no study until now has linked music to a sense of power , identifying not only the consequences but also a potential cause of this link			2
the research , published in @entity105 , first pre-tested 31 pieces of music from several genres , such as sports music , hip - hop , and reggae , to see how powerful participants felt listening to 30 - second clips			2
from this pre-test , they identified the highest power and lowest power songs			0
songs rated as powerful included @entity119 's ' @entity121 's ' @entity120 , ' while songs rated lower in power included songs such as @entity125 ' and @entity126			1
' the researchers found that the high - power music evoked a sense of power subconsciously and also generated three consequences of power - the ability to see the ' bigger picture ' , perceived control in social events and the desire to move first in competitive interactions			1
importantly , the researchers also ruled out lyrics as the cause of the effects , separately asking people to rate how powerful the lyrics made them feel			1
' because participants did not report increased powerful feelings after reading the lyrics , we can rule out the semantic priming effect of lyrics in the selected songs , ' dr @entity37 explains			2
songs evoking a sense of power included @entity119 's ' we will rock you ' ( queen shown at @entity158 in @entity44 , 1986 )			1
high - power music was found to evoke a sense of power subconsciously dr @entity37 's team also conducted separate experiments to look at one structural component of music that might explain the music - power effect : bass levels			1
' we chose to manipulate bass levels in music because existing literature suggests that bass sound and voice are associated with dominance , ' dr @entity37 says			2
they also observed that bass sound and voice are frequently utilised in popular culture to project perceptions of dominance and confidence			0
in the bass experiments , the researchers asked participants to listen to novel instrumental music pieces in which bass levels were digitally varied			1
in one experiment , they surveyed participants about their self - reported feelings of power , and in another , they asked them to perform a word - completion task designed to test implicit , or unconscious , feelings of power			0
they found that those who listened to the heavy - bass music reported more feelings of power and generated more power - related words in the implicit task than those listening to the low - bass music			1
the effects of the bass levels support one possible explanation for why music makes people feel more powerful : the ' contagion hypothesis			1
' the idea is that when people hear specific music components that express a sense of power , they mimic these feelings internally			1
' when watching major sports events , my coauthors and i frequently noticed athletes with their earphones on while entering the stadium and in the locker room , ' says dr @entity37 of the @entity38 at @entity39 in @entity25 ( stock image shown ) however , the researchers also say a ' conditioning hypothesis ' could account for some of the results			2
this suggests that certain pieces of music might trigger powerful experiences because these experiences are often paired with that particular music			0
for example , music used frequently at sports events may elicit powerful feelings because of the association with power , rewards , and winning - for example , @entity119 's ' @entity231 ' is often played to celebrate victory			2
dr @entity37 and colleagues plan to further study other potential mechanisms through which music can induce power			0
they are also interested in exploring whether empowering music can lead to more desirable outcomes in contexts such as negotiations , employee performance , job interviews , marketing campaigns and social perceptions			0
' people might want to explore whether pumping up their favorite tunes can quickly ease them into an empowered mental state before going into a first date , an important client meeting or a job interview , ' says dr @entity37 .			0

@entity25 based researchers have found music makes us feel powerful
they found certain songs could make people work and exercise harder
these songs included ' we will rock you ' and ' get ready for this '
high - power music was found to evoke a sense of power subconsciously
and they also found increased levels of bass also raised the sense of power
