by @entity0 @entity2 captain @entity1 declared his furious team - mates ready to ram taunts from @entity6 players down their throats to secure a @entity9 lifeline			1
the @entity11 skipper missed last week ’s first - leg defeat in the @entity14 capital through long - term injury but was left incensed by the antics of the @entity14 as they goaded their @entity19 opponents at the end of the shock 4 - 1 win			1
for @entity1 , the incident reminded him of the antics of @entity25 after @entity2 ’s 2 - 0 @entity9 qualifying defeat in @entity27 last season			1
spurred on by such ‘ disrespect ’ in the first leg , @entity2 duly won the return in @entity32 3 - 0 to progress on aggregate , with @entity1 booked for celebrating in the face of @entity27 keeper @entity36 at full - time			1
turnaround : @entity39 ( third left ) celebrates his second goal which gave @entity6 a 2 - 1 lead over @entity2 off : @entity42 leaves @entity2 with only 10 men after making a challenge on @entity46 's @entity45 now the 29 - year - old @entity48 skipper expects his side to ease the pressure on under - fire boss @entity51 by ensuring the @entity14 face a similar backlash at @entity53 tomorrow night			1
‘ the @entity6 players got a bit over-confident and celebrated in our boys ’ faces — our lads will remember every single thing , ’ vowed @entity1			1
‘ the lads will be thinking about that as soon as they go into the game			1
they will want to be the ones doing the celebrating at full - time			1
‘ last year , it was similar against @entity66 , and it was such a great night when we went through			0
it was one of those nights people think only happen in fairytales			0
‘ but we turned it around that night after getting battered over there — and it ’s pretty much the same squad of players we have just now			2
‘ yes , we have a lot to do in the second leg and it will be hard , but they are not the best team in the world — and everyone is due a bad result			2
glum : injured @entity2 captain @entity1 ( centre ) looks on from pitchside back on track : @entity39 ( left ) celebrates scoring @entity6 's equaliser ‘ we had ours last week			1
i have faith in the lads that they can turn it around			2
’ yet pressure is mounting on @entity51 even this early in his reign and @entity11 legend @entity96 fears the new boss was chosen to succeed @entity98 solely because he is willing to be manipulated by the club ’s directors			1
@entity96 , part of the @entity102 ’ double - winning centenary side in 1988 , also criticised the board for playing tomorrow night ’s crucial qualifier at the home of @entity19 rugby , claiming that their chances of overturning the 4 - 1 first leg deficit would have been greater at @entity110			1
‘ i hope he is not the puppet some people say he is but i fear he might be , ’ said @entity96			2
‘ what manager comes into a club and is told who his right - hand man will be ? it does n’t work that way			2
‘ i played with ( assistant manager ) @entity121 and we get on well — but he is a strong character			0
‘ if @entity51 is n’t strong , @entity121 will take over			0
early smiles : @entity124 celebrates his strike with @entity2 team - mates ‘ no one had ever heard of this guy but maybe ( chief executive ) @entity130 did n’t expect to go through and he has got someone to point the blame at			2
‘ @entity133 knocked the job back because of the budget but also because he would n’t be allowed to bring his own team in			0
‘ @entity133 would have attracted more players on a reduced budget than @entity51 will			0
‘ he will be shopping in the bargain basement because he does n’t know anything else			0
@entity139 tried to get a few players and never got them			0
‘ you ca n’t keep selling top players and not replace them			0
eventually , you will come a cropper			0
‘ hopefully , i am wrong — but they could get beaten again on wednesday			0
’ @entity96 was speaking as the @entity147 announced a deal with the @entity149 for weekly live commentary on numerous games across @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 2 , @entity155 , @entity156 2 and @entity157 .			0
