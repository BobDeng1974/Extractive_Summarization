@entity0 are ready to challenge @entity1 for @entity3 centre - half @entity2			1
so far @entity1 have failed to agree a fee with @entity5 for the @entity7 winner , with the @entity3 club wanting a sum in excess of £ 25million			1
@entity0 , though , could come up with the cash after the sale of @entity13 to @entity14 on saturday			1
click here to start picking your fantasy football team now ! there ’s £ 60,000 in prizes including £ 1,000 up for grabs every week … battling it out : @entity1 could have a rival for @entity2 ' signature in @entity0 champion : the centre half , middle with @entity26 ( right ) and @entity27 , won the @entity7 with @entity28 @entity29 for it : @entity13 is leaving @entity0 's @entity31 for @entity14 should @entity1 withdraw their interest in @entity2 they are likely to turn to @entity34 defender @entity33 with @entity35 set to sell for around £ 17m			1
and @entity1 are hoping to seal the £ 25m signing of @entity37 forward @entity38 from @entity39 by the end of the weekend			1
@entity1 - bound : @entity41 hopes to compete the signing of @entity38 ( left ) , battling @entity43 @entity44 could make a move for @entity1 striker @entity46 this week			1
@entity46 looks surplus to requirements at @entity49 and has attracted several @entity51 clubs , including @entity52			2
but ideally the @entity54 striker would want to move to a bigger club and @entity44 could fit the bill			1
@entity44 could help finance the deal by offloading misfit centre forward @entity58 , who is wanted by @entity59 to replace @entity60 following the latter 's move to @entity63			1
earning his @entity44 : @entity46 could escape the @entity1 sidlines for a new start with @entity44 @entity67 ’s position as @entity69 manager remains extremely precarious			1
indeed , an insider at the club recently told someone that @entity67 was a ' dead man walking			1
' in the hot seat : @entity67 's days at @entity69 are numbered with the season not having even started @entity76 is the continental arm of the players union			1
they are there to protect the interests of players			0
so why do they seek the defend @entity84 for a deserved and arguably lenient ban for committing an assault on a fellow professional player at a @entity7 ? i am hearing such are vagaries of the doping rules that one @entity51 club is being frustrated in their attempt to help treat one of their players			2
the prominent player is said to have some psychological issues … broadly speaking in the bi-polar spectrum			0
it has been recommended he would benefit from a medication that is commonly prescribed by doctors			0
but the problem is that one of the constituents of the medication comes up on the list of the banned substances			0
i am also hearing although @entity111 have another chance of making the @entity113 proper , @entity110 's move to @entity52 has gone through			2
safe hands : @entity111 keeper @entity110 is on his way to @entity117 's @entity52 side @entity118 are slight favourites to win the @entity119			2
i fancy a draw - click here to get on 2 - 2 at 12 - 1 with @entity122			0
@entity123 is set to make another bid to lure @entity125 from @entity44			1
@entity126 boss @entity123 rated @entity125 when he was coming through the ranks at @entity44 and sent him out on loan to better his development			1
@entity125 lost his way after @entity123 left @entity44 but forced his way into the first team last season with some dazzling displays and only missed out on the @entity7 finals because of injury , although he had suffered a dip in form			1
@entity123 is willing to offer £ 10million to his former club , who may take the cash as they reshape their team			1
@entity144 wonder : @entity123 wants a reunion with @entity44 star @entity125 at @entity146 monday : @entity147 comes out and says that @entity148 should not be proud of his @entity150 career , which is a bit rich from @entity147 given how he underperformed at big tournaments for his country			1
tuesday : @entity154 says @entity150 should boycott the @entity155 in @entity156 because of corruption			0
far better for the @entity158 to lead the fight to force @entity160 to oust @entity161 and his cronies , reform the set - up , then offer to stage the 2018 finals instead of @entity165 and promote the @entity166 to host @entity7 2022			1
wednesday : @entity41 says @entity1 are not ready for the new season			2
for a manager who claims he wo n’t play mind games , a clever way of easing the pressure ahead of the club 's @entity172			0
thursday : @entity69 ’s new £ 12million singing @entity174 claims the club can challenge for a @entity113 slot … then it is revealed the @entity178 player wo n’t be fit for the start of the season			1
what a joke all round			0
friday : after being whipped over two legs by @entity183 , @entity111 get a @entity113 reprieve after @entity186 rule against the @entity188 club for fielding an ' ineligible ' player who came on for the last few minutes of the second leg			0
talk about the rub of the green			0
@entity193 the @entity158 made a big play this week of actually releasing figures to show that at least some of the money made from staging the @entity119 is pumped back into charity			0
after all , it used to be called the @entity119 because when it was first set up in its current format of champions versus @entity203 way back in 1930 , the majority of proceeds were meant to go straight to , well , charity			0
but in 2002 the @entity205 found that the @entity206 had failed to meet its obligations under charity law			0
the commercialisation of the what was once hailed as the ' curtain raiser to the season ' ( that now happens on pre-season tours to the @entity166 and @entity214 ) began in 1974 when the game was first staged at @entity216 , having previously been played at one of the competing club ’s grounds			0
the match between @entity221 and @entity222 remains etched in the history of football for three things it was the last game @entity227 led @entity222 out before retiring			0
it was first proper game of @entity231 ’s ill - fated 44 day reign at @entity221			0
and it saw both @entity233 and @entity234 sent off after a full scale scrap			0
off you go : @entity221 hard man @entity234 ( left ) and @entity233 are dismissed in the 1974 charity shield brawl : @entity221 @entity240 ( centre ) restrains @entity222 's @entity233 in the ill - tempered affair after @entity233 had gone over the top on @entity234 , @entity243 hit @entity233 in the face with a right hander			1
even back then , that attack ranked as sending off but for some reason @entity243 only got booked			0
but after played resumed , @entity233 and @entity234 's tempers spilled over and they slugged it out - literally - stirring the crowd to cry out a familiar chant of the day : ' you 're gon na get your f * * * * * * heads kicked in			2
' tempers frayed : the scrap continues as referee @entity256 loses control of the tie both were sent off and both left the pitch having taken off their shirts and thrown them to the grounds			0
even if football was rougher back then the moral standards so were much higher			0
because it was seen that both players had brought shame onto the @entity270 game on @entity216 ’s ' hallowed turf ' @entity233 and @entity234 were suspended by the @entity158 for eleven games and fined the huge sum for the day of £ 500			0
for the record , the match ended with @entity222 winning on penalties			0
highlights the infamous ill - tempered 1974 @entity119 between @entity222 and @entity221 @entity278 @entity69 are set to battle @entity279 for @entity280 if they do n't land @entity281			1
with @entity283 out for the first months of the season the @entity69 need to bolster their strike force			2
@entity69 have offered @entity285 £ 1million for 33 - year - old @entity281			1
if a compromise ca n't be reached then the @entity69 will consider making a move for @entity280			1
up and at ' em : @entity69 will go after @entity289 striker @entity280 if @entity281 does not sign veteran : the @entity69 are hoping to snap @entity281 up at a cut - price £ 1million from @entity285 the player has yet to agree a new contract with club and has been issued a ' sign or go ' ultimatum by manager @entity295			1
@entity280 is available at a cut price £ 6 million given that his contract is running down			0
@entity69 would probably need to offload one of their squad players to finance a move given their budget for transfers			1
ironically @entity295 could also be a target for the @entity69 if the club eventually part company with @entity67 @entity306 one of the arguments the @entity158 offer to defend the ridiculous £ 100m - plus cost of the @entity310 training facility is that at least it ’s a great hq to teach coaches			1
yet more and more ex-pros and wannabe coaches are now opting to take their badges in @entity317 , under the @entity158 , because the courses are far cheaper			0
two of the most recent high profile @entity323 players to graduate there were former @entity28 midfielder @entity324 and @entity326 @entity7 winner @entity325			2
that is a great example of how cosmopolitan the @entity270 game now is - but clearly the @entity158 are doing something wrong and as it stands the misguided @entity310 project is not fit for purpose			0
btw it is now over two weeks since @entity1 chief executive @entity334 left the club ’s @entity166 tour to go and get some business done			2
as in secure the signings that manager @entity41 wants to rebuild @entity1 ’s ' broken squad '			2
buying players is far from a perfect science , which is why @entity1 have an extensive wish list			2
all smiles : but @entity41 has n't been able to recruit all the new stars he wants for @entity1 but progress has been slow			2
@entity334 did a great bargaining job securing a world record kit deal with but he is not such an expert in the jungle that is the transfer market , as was proved last summer			0
one wonders how long it will be before there is friction between @entity355 and @entity356 if @entity1 do n't get the players the @entity359 coach wants - and soon .			2

@entity3 @entity7 - winning centre half is valued at £ 25million
@entity0 will enter the race now that @entity13 has gone to @entity14
@entity1 hope to complete the signing of @entity38 this weekend
@entity44 are set to make a move for @entity1 's @entity46
@entity67 is a ' dead man walking ' at @entity69
@entity123 wants to lure @entity125 to @entity146
