he claimed his target was to pick 1,100 items a day , about 1.8 per minute			2
mr @entity5 , who left university after his first year and has worked for @entity36 , an insurance broker and an it firm , said : ‘ they gave us no health and safety training after i started work and we just had an induction by @entity8 at the warehouse , where they checked my literacy and numeracy			1
' many of my co-workers did not speak @entity50 , but we were shown a video which demonstrated the picking process , how to use the scanners correctly and handle orders			2
it was four hours worth of training with them talking for most of it			2
' when he experienced stabbing pains in his back and took a few days off , he was moved onto slightly lighter duties but was told by his temp agency that his contract would be terminated if he did not return to work , he said			2
' at the end of my second week i got a bad back and went up to one of the managers to tell him it was really hurting as i went to reach for things , ' he said			0
' everyone is rushing round and rushing harder just to reach their targets			0
there were people there with blisters on their feet and there was a woman of 45 i was working with and her feet were bleeding			0
' as far as i could see loads of people were being pushed too hard			0
i 've done a few jobs , but never a job like this			0
' you get 15 minute breaks and the canteen is a five minute walk from the warehouse , so that 's no real break at all			0
pain : mr @entity5 said the shifts at the warehouse in @entity96 left him feeling middle - aged before his time stress : @entity8 chief executive @entity99 said : ' our culture is friendly and intense , but if push comes to shove , we ¿ ll settle for intense			1

' the conditions that our client has described to us are a great cause for concern ' , he said			1
' as well as affecting an individual 's immediate well - being , if such conditions are proven to exist at @entity8 's fulfilment centres , they could lead to longer term physical problems and greater injuries			1
' it appears from what we have been told that the working conditions @entity176 faced during his brief time at @entity8 's fulfilment centre have caused him the sort of repetitive strain - related back injury we 'd expect to see in someone approaching middle age , which does send the signal that something is n't right with the working environment			2
' a spokesman for @entity8 said : ' we would n't wish to comment on individual members of our workforce			0

@entity5 , 21 , from @entity18 , was one of 15,000 @entity7 temps this year

@entity195 said his *symptoms* were a ' great cause for concern ' for others
