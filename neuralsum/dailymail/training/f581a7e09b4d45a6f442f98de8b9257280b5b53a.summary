here , @entity7 's @entity6 winning coach sir @entity5 rates the two teams and gives his verdict on which @entity0 players deserve to start next week 's second test			1
@entity0 @entity12 - 7not his stellar best , often double tackled , but strong and feisty			1

verdict : did enough to stay in @entity23 - 8 looks fit , fresh and hungry			1
big threat to @entity1 defence			1
verdict : i want him on left wing @entity29 - 7 some really nice touches , laid down a marker for the future			2
verdict : @entity33 if fit too strong : @entity23 ( centre ) is stopped by the @entity1 defence during the test match @entity37 - 6 @entity39 ’s egg			1
some good moments , must adapt to @entity41			2
verdict : move @entity23 to the wing @entity43 - 7 composed , kicked his goals and justified @entity46 ’s confidence			1
verdict : @entity47 to start if fit in the mix : both @entity29 and @entity43 were in impressive form at @entity2 @entity50 - 6 busy against top opponent			2
second fumble nearly cost @entity0 dear			1
verdict : @entity54 returns if fit substitutes - 7 not a massive factor but @entity57 got on the front foot and kicked his penalty with aplomb			2
@entity61 - 7 solid evening ’s work and that short fuse seemed well under control			2
verdict : good to go again battle : @entity61 ( centre ) is tackled by @entity68 ( left ) and @entity69 during @entity0 's defeat @entity71 - 7 a standout effort			1
good in the tight and line - out , extra option in loose			0

verdict : one of the first names on the team sheet safe hands : @entity80 was strong in the line - out on saturday @entity88 - 7 fine return after long time out of @entity90			0
ran line - out intelligently			0
verdict : @entity92 to come back @entity93 - 7 finished strongly for @entity94 and maintained that form here			0
verdict : @entity97 is first choice @entity99 ( capt ) - 8 one of his best performances - and against @entity69 as well			1
verdict : will lead from front again @entity103 - 7 very fine effort , carried very well and gave @entity0 go - forward			1
verdict : ... but @entity107 returns leader : @entity0 skipper @entity99 ( centre ) put in one of his best performances @entity1 @entity112 - 6 one slashing run in attack but unusually error - prone for such a quality player			1
@entity116 - 7 made up for earlier handling errors with that brilliant try - scoring pass at the death			0
@entity120 - 8 the old head knew exactly what was required in the 79th minute to score his try			0
experienced : @entity120 scored the crucial 79th minute try for @entity1 @entity125 - 6 not at his best by any means			1
should have been yellow - carded for shirt - tugging early on			0
@entity129 - 6 quiet night , few chances to shine , which is a testament to @entity0 ’s pressure game			1
@entity132 - 7 not without error but a very accomplished stand - in for the resting @entity135			0
@entity136 - 8 livewire , clever kicker , speedy delivery			0
@entity1 ’s best player on the night			2
@entity140 man : @entity136 of the @entity1 was one of the best players on the pitch at @entity2 @entity143 - 6 veteran @entity6 - winning prop but @entity0 had the better of the front - row exchanges			1
@entity147 - 6 has bulked up but still struggling at scrum time			0
@entity1 scrum improved when he departed			2
@entity151 - 6 had his hands full in the tight and not seen in the loose as much as usual			0
missing : @entity147 ( centre ) struggled to impose himself when it came to scrum time @entity156 - 7 made that long second - half break and considerable line - out force			0
@entity160 - 7 unsung workhorse as ever but tough going against an aggressive @entity0 pack			2
stopped : @entity0 managed @entity69 well and kept the @entity1 captain relatively quiet @entity68 - 6 came second - best to @entity0 at the tackle area			1
could drop out if @entity166 returns			0
@entity69 ( capt ) - 7 quiet by his immense standards			0
@entity0 power at breakdown helped negate him			2
@entity172 - 7 not a natural no 8			0
great athlete and driving force - but at blindside flanker .			0

@entity0 captain @entity99 was at his very best against @entity1
