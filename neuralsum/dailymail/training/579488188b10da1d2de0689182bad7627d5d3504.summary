by @entity0 for @entity1 a whole host of personal safety apps have been launched , but most of them rely on a user being able to operate their smartphone when they feel threatened , which may not always be possible			0
now one man has launched an inconspicuous bracelet that at the press an @entity14 button , alerts relatives to the whereabouts of the wearer			2
the @entity20 bracelet connects to a smartphone via @entity22 and works alongside a free app for @entity25 handsets - with one for @entity26 coming soon			1
he told @entity1 : ‘ many times , when faced with personal threat , it becomes almost impossible to take the smartphone out from your pocket or handbag , unlock it , and send out an emergency message			2
‘ in such situations , the @entity20 wristband could make all the difference in broadcasting that crucial sms with your location data to loved ones			0
’ when users first set up the bracelet , they use the app ( pictured ) to select their five emergency contacts			1
the bracelet works alongside a free @entity25 app and a version for @entity26 is launching soon the bracelet has an @entity14 button that when pressed twice sends a text message to up to five ‘ guardian angel ’ contacts			1
these contacts can be selected via a free @entity25 app. the @entity14 text includes a link to the wearer ’s location , which is marked on @entity75 and updated every two minutes			1
guardian angels can see a wearer ’s location at any time they choose			0
the bracelet costs $ 45 ( £ 27 ) including shipping and a pendant version is also available			1
it is made from waterproof rubber and comes in three colours : black , brown and white - with bright colours planned			0
the bracelet is designed to appeal to women and senior citizens , particularly in economically less developed countries			0
to call for help , a user only needs to press the @entity14 button on the bracelet twice in quick succession			2
this action lets them send a text message to five emergency contacts or ‘ guardian angels ’			1
this message includes the wearer ’s location and also marks their coordinates on @entity75 every two minutes			1
mr @entity36 came up with the idea for his smart band after a close friend was abducted and tortured in a case of mistaken identity , he told @entity110			0
‘ that incident instilled ideas in my mind as to what we could do to save someone or how someone could send out their location in an emergency , ’ he said			0
when users first set up the bracelet , they use the app to select their five emergency contacts			2
and although a call for help can be sent simply by tapping the button on the band , an emergency message can also be sent by using a linked smartphone ’s power button or via the app itself - much like other rival safety apps			2
mr @entity36 told @entity1 that his target users are women , senior citizens and visually impaired people and he has found the bracelets are in demand by middle class people in developing countries			0
the bracelet costs $ 45 ( £ 27 ) including shipping and there is also a pendant version available for the same cost via the @entity20 website			1
mr @entity36 claims that he sold 880 of them in the first two months they were available .			0
