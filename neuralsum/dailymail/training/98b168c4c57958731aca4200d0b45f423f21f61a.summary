by @entity0 atmospheric co2 levels are expected to be significantly elevated by around 2050			1
and researchers have warned that crops that provide the global population with most of their dietary zinc and iron will be affected			1
that 's according to a new study led by the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) , who say plants will have significantly reduced concentrations of those nutrients			1
a new study from the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) says plants will be significantly less nutritious by 2050 if levels of carbon dioxide continue to elevate an estimated two billion people suffer from zinc and iron deficiencies			1
this results in a loss of 63 million life years annually from malnutrition			0
thus the reduction in these nutrients represents the most significant health threat ever shown to be associated with climate change , says the @entity9			1
' this study is the first to resolve the question of whether rising @entity32 concentrations - which have been increasing steadily since the @entity33 - threaten human nutrition , ' said @entity35 , research scientist in the @entity36 at the @entity9 and the study 's lead author			1
some previous studies of crops grown in greenhouses and chambers at elevated @entity32 had found nutrient reductions , but those studies were criticised for using artificial growing conditions			1
experiments using free air carbon dioxide enrichment ( face ) technology became the gold standard as @entity49 allowed plants to be grown in open fields at elevated levels of @entity32 , but those prior studies had small sample sizes and have been inconclusive			2
this study now , however , shows that the loss of iron and zinc from grains and legumes at elevated @entity32 is significant			1
in the study they found that grains and legumes lost significant amounts of iron and zinc at elevated levesl of @entity32			1
the researchers say two to three billion people around the world receive 70 % of their dietary zinc and / or iron from crops like these @entity35 and his colleagues estimate that two to three billion people around the world receive 70 % or more of their dietary zinc and / or iron from @entity77 crops , particularly in the developing world , where zinc and iron deficiency is already a major health concern			1
@entity83 plants are those that have long growing seasons and spend a lot of time in the sun. @entity77 plants , meanwhile , are found in a broader range of environments			0
in the study @entity83 crops appeared to be less affected by higher co2 , which is consistent with underlying plant physiology			2
this is because @entity83 plants concentrate co2 inside the cell for photosynthesis so they might be expected to be less sensitive to changes outside the cell in @entity32 concentration			2
but the researchers were surprised to find that zinc and iron varied substantially across cultivars ( plants chosen for their desirable characteristics ) of rice			2
that finding suggests that there could be an opportunity to breed reduced sensitivity to the effect of elevated co2 into crop cultivars in the future			0
in addition to efforts to reduce co2 emissions , genetically engineering crops to increase their nutritional value ( known as biofortification ) with regards to iron and zing could reduce the human health impacts of these changes , said @entity35			2
he also suggests we could breed cultivars with reduced sensitivity to @entity32 and provide nutritional supplementation for the populations most impacted if rising @entity32 levels can not be quelled			0
' @entity134 is conducting a global experiment by rapidly altering the environmental conditions on the only habitable planet we know , ' he said			0
' as this experiment unfolds , there will undoubtedly be many surprises			0
' finding out that rising @entity32 threatens human nutrition is one such surprise			0
' the researchers analysed data involving 41 cultivars ( plants chosen for their desirable characteristics ) of grains and legumes from the @entity77 and @entity83 functional groups from seven different face locations in @entity152 , @entity153 , and the @entity154			0
@entity83 plants are those that have long growing seasons and spend a lot of time in the sun. @entity77 plants , meanwhile , are found in a broader range of environments			0
the c denotes carbon and the different photosynthesis processes ; @entity77 plants convert atmospheric carbon into a chemical compound with four carbon atoms , while @entity77 plants convert one into three			0
the level of co2 across all seven sites was in the range of 546 - 586 parts per million ( ppm )			0
they tested the nutrient concentrations of the edible portions of wheat and rice ( @entity77 grains ) , maize and sorghum ( @entity83 grains ) and soybeans and field peas ( @entity77 legumes )			0
the results showed a significant decrease in the concentrations of zinc , iron , and protein in @entity77 grains			1
for example , zinc , iron and protein concentrations in wheat grains grown at the face sites were reduced by 9.3 per cent , 5.1 per cent and 6.3 per cent respectively , compared with wheat grown at ambient co2			2
zinc and iron were also significantly reduced in legumes , although protein was not			0
the finding that @entity77 grains and legumes lost iron and zinc at elevated @entity32 is significant , says the @entity9 .			1

@entity9 says food will lose *key* nutrients by 2050
this is if levels of @entity32 continue to rise , claim the researchers in their study
some crops were found to lose significant iron and zinc with more co2
this *included* grains and legumes , which 2 to 3 billion people around the world rely on for 70 % of their zinc and iron
@entity9 says it is the most significant threat associated with climate change
