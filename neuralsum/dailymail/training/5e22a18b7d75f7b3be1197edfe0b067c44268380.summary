suffering : girls were sold for £ 600 a time			2
this picture is posed by a model during her primary school years , @entity3 was considered academically gifted and dreamed of becoming a forensic scientist			1
at home , her loving parents read her bedtime stories and would at times remind her to feed her giant african land snail			2
but when she turned 12 her life changed forever			1
sitting on some steps with a friend in @entity13 , @entity3 was approached by two @entity15 brothers who befriended her with alcohol and cigarettes			1
she was flattered by the attention they paid her , completely unaware she was being groomed for sexual exploitation until it was too late			1
for almost three years she was violently and sexually abused by a gang and then sold for sex on hundreds of different occasions to a network of child abusers across @entity27			1
shockingly , during her ordeal she told police and social services she was being abused , but nothing was done to help her			2
as some of her abusers started long jail sentences yesterday , @entity3 spoke for the first time about her three - year nightmare			1
she told the @entity37 : ‘ by all accounts i was a bit of a geek at school , ’ she said			0
‘ then six months later i become somebody who went missing all the time , coming back days later , filthy and dirty			0
' the sudden change is scary to think about , even now			0
’ @entity3 still struggles to comprehend how a girl with upstanding parents – her father is a civil engineer – could fall prey to such abuse			1
‘ at the start they made out like they wanted to be your friend			0
then the intensity crept up			0
they would put you off everybody			0
they would say your family was your enemy , your friends were your enemies			0
pictured is a room at the guest house ‘ by this point i thought my teenage friends would n’t like me any more			0
they would say if you go back to school no one is going to like you because you ’re a slag			0
’ after several months , the @entity15 men began to ask her for sex , pretending to want a loving relationship with her			1
but soon they were threatening violence if @entity3 refused to do what she was told			1
@entity81 ( left ) and @entity82 ( right ) were each given a life sentence with a minimum of 17 years at the @entity85 @entity82 ( left ) , 38 , was given life with a minimum of 20 years for the ' dreadful offences ' he committed against the girls			2
his brother @entity82 ( right ) , 34 , was also handed a life sentence with a minimum of 15 years ‘ it ’s something i felt i had to do , ’ she said			1
‘ although i knew what sex was , there ’s a difference between having sex as an adult and as a child			1
this was people taking advantage of a child			2
’ as her ordeal intensified , @entity3 was taken to rooms in guest houses and flats in the backstreets of east @entity13			1
‘ i was taken to parties , ’ she recalled			0
‘ by party i mean everybody coming and having sex with me			2
if i said i did n’t want it , it would just happen anyway			0
’ @entity82 ( left ) , 27 , was jailed for life with a minimum term of 12 years while @entity82 ( right ) , 32 , was sentenced to seven years in prison @entity82 , 28 , was jailed for seven years for two counts of sexual activity with a child on some occasions there were up to ten men were in the room , waiting to have sex with her			1
@entity3 said : ‘ they just thought they could do what they wanted with me , no matter how disgusting			1
it got to the point where i just went along with things			0
' mentally i shut down and just did it			0
’ aged 14 , and by now in a care home , she alerted her carer to the abuse but was ignored			0
a month after her 15th birthday , she told police that one of her abusers , @entity81 , was forcing her to have sex with him and other men			1
but instead of following up these allegations , she said officers threatened to arrest her for wasting police time			0
‘ my behaviour and appearance should have been sending alarm bells , ’ she said			0
although @entity3 is now in a long - term relationship , memories of her past still haunt her			2
she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder at the age of 15 and suffers from severe bouts of depression and @entity156 .			2
