by @entity0 published : 20:55 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 05:47 est , 16 july 2013 an astronomer studying old images of @entity3 found a 14th moon orbiting the planet - by accident			1
the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) revealed the find yesterday and said the moon , estimated to be about 12 miles in diameter , is located approximately 65,400 miles from @entity3			1
astronomer @entity11 , from the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , was searching @entity16 images for moons inside faint ring fragments circling @entity3			1
accidental find : this composite @entity16 picture shows the location of a newly discovered moon , s / 2004 n 1 , orbiting @entity3			1
it 's 100million times fainter than the faintest star visible with the naked eye @entity3 's largest moon , @entity26 , was discovered in 1846 , just days after the planet itself was found			1
@entity28 , @entity3 's third largest moon , was found in 1949			1
images taken by @entity7 's @entity32 spacecraft unveiled the second largest moon , @entity34 , and five smaller moons , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			1
ground - based telescopes found @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 in 2002			0
@entity46 turned up a year later			0
the expert said : ‘ we had been processing the data for quite some time and it was on a whim that i said , ' ok , let 's just look out further '			2
’ ‘ i changed my program so that instead of stopping just outside the ring system it processed the data all the way out			0
' i walked away from my computer and waited an hour while it did all the processing			0
’ ‘ when i came back , i looked at the image			0
there was this extra dot that was n't supposed to be there			0
’ follow - up analysis of other archived @entity16 images of @entity3 verified the object was a moon			1
the tiny moon has previously escaped detection by @entity7 's @entity32 spacecraft , which flew past @entity3 in 1989 and surveyed the planet 's system of moons and rings			1
in space : this diagram released by @entity7 shows the orbits of several moons located close to the planet @entity3			1
@entity3 's largest moon , @entity26 , was discovered in 1846 , just days after the planet itself was found mr @entity11 said : ' the moons and arcs orbit very quickly , so we had to devise a way to follow their motion in order to bring out the details of the system			1
' ' it 's the same reason a sports photographer tracks a running athlete — the athlete stays in focus , but the background blurs			0
' @entity3 's moons and arcs ' smear out ' when captured by the @entity16 because of their rapid orbital motion			1
the astronomer re-processed the images to compensate for this smear and discovered the new moon as an extra white dot that has escaped attention before			2
interestingly , the moon is too faint to be seen in individual images but was noticeable when experts looked at sets of ten images together			2
the astronomer has tracked the moon 's movement in more than 150 pictures taken by @entity16 from 2004 to 2009			1
he then plotted a circular orbit for the moon , which completes one revolution around @entity3 every 23 hours			2
mr @entity11 made the discovery after he decided to focus his attention beyond @entity3 's faint ring that contains its known moons ( pictured )			1
' i looked at the image			0
there was this extra dot that was n't supposed to be there , ' he said mr @entity11 and colleagues are mulling over a name to propose to the @entity129 , which has final say in the matter			2
‘ we have n't really gotten far with that , ’ he said			0
‘ what i can say is that the name will be out of @entity136 and @entity138 mythology and it will have to do with characters who are related to @entity3 , the god of the oceans			0
’ the newly found moon , designated s / 2004 n 1 , is located between @entity40 and @entity34			0
it orbits @entity3 in 23 hours			0
the moon is so small and dim that it is 100million times fainter than the faintest star that can be seen with the naked eye			0
the considerably bigger gas giant @entity151 has four times as many moons , with 67			0
the astronomer is pondering names for the new moon but thinks that it may reference @entity136 or @entity138 mythology and be linked to characters related to the god of the ocean , @entity3			2
an image of the planet @entity3 is pictured			2

@entity7 says moon has 12 - mile diameter and is 65,400 miles from @entity3
astronomer looked for moons inside faint ring fragments circling planet
but @entity11 then analysed *broader* part of the *sky* ' on a whim '
he tracked movement of 's / 2004 @entity178 ' in 150 pictures from 2004 to 2009
