by @entity0 the d - day landings have been recreated as a virtual world to allow a new generation to experience the invasion of @entity5 using 3d displays and virtual reality headsets			1
@entity9 researchers painstakingly scanned and recreated the landing craft , gliders and even the artificial harbour , known as the @entity12 , for the virtual invasion recreation			1
the team today revealed their work as part of the seventieth anniversary of @entity18 and the @entity19			2
developed in part by @entity26 of the @entity27 , it was an artificial harbor built in @entity28 , transported across the @entity29 and assembled off the coast at @entity31 to unload the vast quantities of supplies and men that were needed for battle			2
@entity36 , son of major @entity26 , who designed the mile - long @entity12 bridge , stands on a virtual recreation of his father 's work , long lost under the waters of @entity43 , @entity9			1
in order to preserve the engineering innovations that were instrumental in the war , a team of experts led by @entity46 used @entity51 design software to accurately recreate the harbor , and have projected into onto giant screens and into @entity55 goggles			1
some of the innovations engineered for the invasion and now recreated are : @entity58 ( @entity59 ) was designed by @entity61 businessman @entity60 and carried a platoon - sized @entity63 complement of men and weapons to the beaches of @entity43			1
@entity69 gliders were relatively small , lightweight and maneuverable planes			2
most importantly , they were silent and could land troops in enemy territory during the early hours of the june 6 invasion			2
the glider could carry up to 13 men or a vehicle			0
@entity46 , the @entity79 firm behind the project , say it is designed to ' safeguard the memory of some of the remarkable engineering achievements of @entity18 and preserve it for future generations , ’ the 3d model is an accurate , scientific reconstruction of the @entity12 that will allow many to see and experience a site that was destroyed after @entity23			1
the @entity46 teams also identified , located and gathered all available data in order to create detailed 3d models of both the @entity93 glider and @entity59 landing craft , right down to the last nut and bolt , taking careful account of the specific materials used and how they would have behaved in actual conditions			1
' virtually reconstructing the @entity12 , the @entity59 landing craft and the @entity93 glider brings to life one of the most exciting episodes of 20th - century history for the broadest possible audience , safeguarding this valuable part of our engineering heritage – a heritage that is gradually being lost , ' said @entity111 , @entity112 for @entity46			1
' this project builds a bridge between the engineers of yesterday and today by preserving the memory of these remarkable technological innovations			0
the result is a fitting tribute to the engineers of then and now			0
' much of the hardware deployed on d - day was part of a huge effort among the @entity125 to develop the weapons , airplanes , landing crafts and other innovations that could turn the tide of the war			2
a beach assault required the engineering of wholly new ways to land an invading army , along with the necessary gear and supplies that the operation entailed			0
the @entity59 or @entity60 boat was a landing craft which allowed the @entity125 to disembark massive numbers of men on the beaches of @entity43 70 years ago			1
the @entity69 was accurately recreated in @entity144 by @entity46 , using what remained of the original blueprints and designs			2
the glider was one of many engineering innovations built specifically to enable the @entity125 victory in @entity23			0
the @entity46 ’ recreation of the @entity12 will be featured in an upcoming two - hour documentary , “ @entity18 ’s @entity154 , ” produced by the @entity156 science series , @entity157			1
the film follows the team as they carry out the most extensive survey ever done of the seabed bordering the legendary @entity18 beachheads of @entity43 , revealing the ingenious technology that helped the @entity125 overcome the @entity165 defenses and ultimately liberate @entity166 from the @entity167			0
one of the key parts of the project was the @entity12 the @entity12 was one of the most extraordinary technological feats of @entity23			1
developed in part by @entity174 of the @entity27 , it was an artificial harbor built in @entity28 , transported across the @entity29 and assembled off the coast at @entity31 to unload the vast quantities of supplies and men that were needed for battle			0
@entity23 , @entity9 7th june 1944 : aerial view of the concrete @entity12 in position at @entity43 during the @entity183 invasion an artificial harbor was assembled off the coast at @entity31 — the first temporary deepwater facility of its kind ever devised and attempted			1
it was be used to offload no less than 2.5 million men , 500,000 vehicles and 4 million tonnes of supplies			0
major @entity26 of the @entity27 developed a system of floating metal roadways mounted on pontoon units of concrete or steel , which connected the beaches to the floating pierheads , further out to sea where large vessels could berth			0
thanks to legs that rested on the seabed but allowed these floating platforms to move up and down with the tide , operations could continue round the clock , which was a world first			0
the system used to join the floating sections gave them great flexibility , absorbing movements caused by sea swell and the weight of vehicles moving over them			0
the ‘ kite ’ anchors , which moored the floating platforms to the seabed , were designed to dig in further when the cable is pulled , keeping the structure firmly in place throughout the landing operations			0
huge reinforced concrete caissons were laid in a semicircle around the artificial harbor to form a breakwater , protecting it from tide surges and storm damage			0
by the end of july 1944 , the @entity230 at @entity31 was the world ’s busiest port in terms of traffic volumes			0
the @entity12 was the first temporary deep water facility of its kind ever devised			1
today , nearly seventy years after d - day , only pieces of the @entity12 remain			2
to recreate the @entity12 , the @entity46 team compiled what remained of the original plans from the @entity242 in @entity243 , the construction and maintenance manuals , the aerial photographs taken at the time and additional information provided by @entity36 , the son of @entity12 designer @entity26 , himself a marine engineer			1
all of this valuable data was brought together and scrutinized over a period of almost eight months by the lab teams , to enable the son of its inventor to virtually stand on it in an immersive 3d experience			0
the virtual recreation allows people to stand onboard the @entity261 ( right ) , and even see the amphibious vehicles driving onto the beach ( left ) built in @entity51 , the same technology used by leading manufacturers to digitally design cars , airplanes and other advanced products , people can experience these 3d recreations through a number of different technologies , from typical computer screens , to @entity275 virtual reality headsets , to an immersive virtual reality experience as shown here			1
“ @entity157 : d - day ’s @entity278 ” premieres wednesday , may 28 , 2014 at 9pm edt on @entity156 ( check local listings ) .			0
