click here for updates on @entity3 ' condition after his injury reaction from across the cricket world to the incident the cricket world is in shock after the news that @entity3 is in a critical condition after being hit on the head by a bouncer playing for @entity13 against @entity14 in the @entity15			1
not only shock because of the extent of the @entity18 ’s injuries but because this is an incident of unprecedented seriousness , certainly since helmets were introduced more than 30 years ago to significantly reduce the risk of being hurt while batting in cricket			1
while what happened in the historic surroundings of the @entity27 can legitimately be called a freak incident perhaps the biggest surprise is that this sort of thing is , thankfully , so rare in the great game			2
warning some pictures and video in this story may be distressing @entity3 reacts after being hit on the head by a delivery from pace bowler @entity38 @entity3 turns away from @entity38 's bouncer and the ball hits him on the side of the head a cricket ball is a seriously hard , dangerous weapon when propelled at close to a 100 miles per hour by the best bowlers in the world and perhaps the most sobering thought after a truly horrible affair is that injury on this scale does n’t happen more regularly			1
batsmen have been hit on the head and been badly hurt over the years - of course they have , and incidents involving @entity18 @entity53 , @entity55 ’s @entity54 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity59 ’s @entity58 only last summer come to mind - but no - one that i can recall has been as badly hurt as the stricken @entity3			1
there is no point blaming the safety equipment because cricket , as with so much sport , comes with an inherent risk and the great strides that have been made ever since @entity69 first appeared in the @entity70 with a sort of skull cap and @entity73 wore a motorcycle helmet have been huge			0
@entity58 is hit by a ball that got through his grille against @entity77 last summer the @entity59 man tries to stop the bleeding from his nose ( left ) and lines up for a team photo some days later cricketers have always sought protection and there were tales of batsmen using towels , scarves and padded caps before @entity91 was one of the first to use a self designed protective hat in the 1930s			1
@entity96 saw the first helmets being worn regularly , most notably by @entity98 and @entity59 batsman @entity73 , while @entity13 ’s @entity99 was the first to wear a helmet in a @entity101 , against @entity102 in 1978			0
the design and level of safety has evolved ever since but even last summer more moves were made to protect batsmen after @entity58 had been struck in the gap between his safety grille and the peak of his airtek helmet , commonly regarded now as the safest design , at @entity113 against @entity77 and was lucky to escape serious injury			2
@entity57 is hit by a @entity116 delivery at @entity117 in 2005 ( left ) and his cut is clearly visible @entity56 holds his face and throws away his bat after being hit by a @entity122 bouncer in 1986 @entity123 returns to the pavilion at @entity125 , @entity126 , with blood pouring from his nose but they can not be foolproof and those batsmen who reach the very top will tell you that fear never enters their head			1
the last thing @entity3 would have been thinking of was getting hurt as he attempted to pull a short ball from @entity14 ' seamer @entity38 on tuesday morning			1
@entity138 players would have simply got out of the way			0
he and all other international batsmen would not be successful if they did worry about injury and fear is more likely to be found at a much lower level , where club players can be seen putting self - preservation ahead of the need to score runs , certainly lower order batsmen			0
there is a theory that helmets have actually increased the risk of injury in a weird sort of way , because they encourage the very best batsmen to go for more audacious shots than they would ever have attempted bare headed			0
@entity69 ( left ) wearing his prototype cap - style helmet against @entity13 in 1977 @entity18 @entity99 batting in a crash helmet , the first person to wear such headgear in a test match , and ducking a bouncer from @entity102 paceman @entity165 in @entity166 during the 1977 - 78 tour former @entity59 batsman @entity73 in the nets in 1978 wearing his helmet the art of ducking and weaving , for instance , as batsmen would have had to master against the great fast bowlers of a bygone age like @entity177 and @entity178 , has almost disappeared in an era when batsmen , highly protected and with huge heavy bats , are dominant and bowlers are rarely as quick as they once were			1
none of which is particularly relevant to the plight of the talented and highly popular @entity3 , a well regarded figure in the @entity188 county game as well as of an opponent of @entity59 ’s , as he fights for his life in a @entity27 hospital			2
his has been an up - and - down career at the highest level and he has not played a test for @entity13 since struggling against @entity59 in the 2013 ashes and scoring just one and one in the last of his 26 tests to date at @entity117			0
but he was on the way back as far as @entity13 were concerned and was expected to play in the first test against @entity77 because of injury to his friend and captain @entity201 , who was at his bedside on tuesday after the horrific incident			0
there is huge sympathy too for young fast bowler @entity38 , 22 , who was being comforted and offered psychological support after his unwitting part in this tragic affair			2
he will know that no - one blames him for beating @entity3 ' defences but that will not make him feel any the less distraught			0
for now , the cricket community has come together in their support of one of their own			0
the world ’s thoughts are with @entity3 and his family			1
@entity55 batsman @entity54 ( near right ) turns away after being hit by a @entity223 delivery			0

cricket world in shock after @entity3 in *intensive* care following @entity38 bouncer in @entity15 match
that type of incident very rare nowadays thanks to helmets
@entity58 , @entity57 and @entity56 have suffered head injuries while batting , despite wearing helmets
a cricket ball is a dangerous weapon when hurled down at nearly 100mph
