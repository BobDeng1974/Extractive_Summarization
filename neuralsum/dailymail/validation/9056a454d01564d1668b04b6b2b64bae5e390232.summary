@entity0 would ideally prefer to play @entity2 quarter - final opponents @entity3 on grass - but he recognises the need for a strong atmosphere after an emotional victory over the @entity8			1
@entity9 admitted playing in front of a capacity 7,500 crowd at the @entity12 in @entity13 was among his best experiences in tennis after his straight - sets win over @entity17 helped @entity18 into an unassailable 3 - 1 lead			1
the reward for the thrilling @entity22 first - round victory is a last - eight home tie with @entity3 on july 17 - 19 , at the end of the grass - court season			1
@entity0 would prefer @entity18 's @entity2 tie with @entity3 to be played on grass in july @entity18 received brilliant support at @entity13 's @entity12 as they beat the @entity8 all three days of @entity2 action at the @entity12 were sold out in a matter of minutes captain @entity31 will discuss possible venues with both his team and the @entity34 and @entity0 would prefer to play on grass			1
' it 's a surface i really like , it 's a good surface for @entity40 ( @entity41 ) as well with his serve , ' the 2013 @entity37 champion said			2
' i would n't say the @entity3 players love the grass outside of ( @entity44			1
he would be their best player on the grass			0
i do n't think ( @entity47 ) @entity47 is as comfortable on that surface , ( @entity49 ) @entity50 i do n't think is that comfortable on it			0
( @entity53 ) @entity52 i think can play well but i do n't think he has played amazing in @entity2 in the past			1
@entity31 embraces @entity0 after the @entity56 's straight sets win secured @entity58 's quarter - final berth @entity0 is the centre of attention after securing a tie against @entity3 ' @entity62 might be a good surface but we will have to see because playing in front of a crowd like this makes a difference and it helps			1
if we ca n't guarantee that at a grass venue then maybe it makes sense to play it at a venue where we can get that			2
' having the crowd with you makes a big difference			0
for some reason people think in tennis that playing in front of a home crowd is crippling in a way and makes people incredibly nervous			0
' it can make you nervous but if you look at the @entity86 , @entity85 was our best @entity86 ever and there was a reason for that			0
the crowd makes a big difference			0
' i do n't have an ideal venue			0
it 's not up to me			0
the atmosphere here was the best i have played in , and indoor venues have better noise , but at that time of the year we also have the option of playing outdoors			2

@entity18 beat the @entity8 3 - 2 in @entity2 in @entity13
they will now play @entity3 in the quarter - finals on july 17 - 19
the tie is likely to be played on grass but @entity37 is *ruled* out
@entity0 admitted he would prefer the tie on grass rather than indoor
