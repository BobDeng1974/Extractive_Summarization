' the conservatives were elected , albeit in insufficient numbers , to do a job			0
we hope to be elected in two years ' time in rather greater numbers to implement a @entity18 manifesto in full			0
' but we do n't look as if either of those things is our priority			0
we need to pull ourselves out of what threatens to become a spiral of irrelevance			0
' at least 100 @entity18 mps are expected to back an amendment allowing heterosexual couples to have civil partnerships too			1
but today @entity5 announced it would not back the rebels , and tabled their own amendment to allow for a public consultation on opposite - sex civil partnerships			1

' during early debate in the @entity4 today , @entity18 mp @entity90 said : ' it seems to many of us if you dare to disagree with the new orthodoxy that gay marriage is the best thing since sliced bread , you are somehow breaking a new social taboo , you are doing something in your workplace , particularly in the public sector , that you should not be doing			2

' @entity144 warned of a ‘ crisis of conservatism ’ , saying the prime minister was badly out of touch with the party membership over gay marriage			1
opening up civil partnerships to all would be a far bigger move than gay marriage itself , which affects only relatively small numbers			1
the amendment could delay implementation of the entire legislative package for two years – meaning the first gay weddings would be delayed until after the next election			0

today mrs @entity132 warned rebels against any action which would delay the introduction of gay marriage			2
' i think it would make a fundamental difference to the passage of the bill because what the amendment is trying to import in a very complicated concept which actually took more than 200 clauses to explain in the original civil partnership bill to a bill which is all about extending marriage , ' she told @entity82 's today programme			0
' it introduces complexity which would not only i believe delay the passage of the bill through @entity229 but it would also put forward a number of quite fundamental policy issues which need considerable thought and consultation , let alone any delays around implementation			0
