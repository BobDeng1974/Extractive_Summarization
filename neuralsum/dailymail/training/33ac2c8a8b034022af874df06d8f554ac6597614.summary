the grave of a woman who appears to have died in childbirth 7,700 years ago , has yielded a surprising new discovery , years after being found			2
archaeologists studying the @entity6 grave found evidence of twins who died during a traumatic birth , along with their mother			2
the bones are thought to be the oldest example of death by obstructed labour and the earliest known evidence of twins so far			1
scientists studying the bones of a woman who died in childbirth 7,700 years ago ( pictured ) , discovered tiny foetus bones in her pelvic area and between her thighs - the oldest known example of death by obstructed labour			1
tiny bones can be seen under the skeleton 's left rib cage , on her pelvis and between her thighs the grave was first discovered in 1997 in a @entity34 cemetery in @entity35 , which lies near the south of the oldest freshwater lake in the world , @entity31 , @entity30 reported			1
the ‘ @entity40 ’ cemetery was unearthed in 1897 when the @entity41 was under construction , but is partially unexcavated because some of it is covered by buildings			0
a total of 101 skeletons , thought to be members of a hunter - gatherer community , have so far been recovered from the site			0
in 2012 , @entity51 , an archaeologist at the @entity52 in @entity53 , took a fresh look at a skeleton in storage at @entity57			0
duplicate foetal bones ( pictured ) revealed that woman , who was between 20 and 25 years old , died while giving birth to twins - the earliest known evidence of twins so far in the archaeological record the grave was first discovered in 1997 in a @entity34 cemetery in @entity35 , which lies near the south of the oldest freshwater lake in the world , @entity31			1
the ‘ @entity40 ’ cemetery ( marked on the map ) was unearthed in 1897 when the @entity41 was under construction the occupant of the grave was initially thought to be a mother aged between 20 and 25 years , with a single child			2
but by studying the foetal remains , dr @entity51 , realised there were duplicate bones			0
by studying the position of foetal bones positioned in the mother 's pelvic area , @entity51 thinks the woman , who was aged between 20 and 25 , died in childbirth			1
she believes that one of the twins may have been in the breech position – with their feet pointing down – and was only partially delivered			1
the second twin appears to have died in the womb , trapped behind the other , leading to a fatally obstructed birth			2
‘ within five minutes , i said to my colleague , “ oh my gosh ; these are twins , ” ’ she told @entity30			0
the foetal bones were all situated in the mother ’s pelvic area and between her thighs			1
dr @entity51 came to the conclusion that the mother probably died during a particularly traumatic birth , after analysing the original placement of the tiny bones			1
she believes that one of the twins may have been in the breech position – with their feet pointing down – and was only partially delivered			1
the second twin appears to have got trapped behind the first and died in the womb , with the mother dying from the obstructed birth			2
dr @entity51 said of her theory : ‘ it might be a bit circumstantial , but i think it 's quite strong			0
’ the mother was buried lying on her back with a handful of marmot teeth positioned on her body , which is not unusual in ancient graves at the site			0
the bones are thought to be the oldest example of death by obstructed labour and the earliest known evidence of twins so far			1
the temporal bone ( part of the skull ) of ' foetus two ' is shown on the left and both temporal bones of ' foetus one ' are shown middle and right dr @entity51 thinks that the teeth indicate members of the community were either unaware that the woman was pregnant or that her type of death was not unusual			2
while death as a result of childbirth was likely common in ancient times , evidence of it and instances of twins are incredibly rare in the archaeological record			0
they are particularly rare in @entity150 , for example , because an ancient roman law called @entity153 decreed that babies had to be removed from their mother ’s womb before burial			0
furthermore , gases from a decomposing body sometimes push a foetus out of a mother ’s body after burial , resulting in what is known as a ' coffin birth ' and the bones of unborn babies are incredibly fragile and often decay			0
the discovery was reported in the journal @entity170 .			0

grave was uncovered in @entity35 , @entity173 , near @entity31 in 1997
it was thought to contain the bones of a young mother and her child
in 2012 , the foetal bones of twins were discovered in the pelvic area
*expert* claims woman died in labour , when one twin was partially delivered
position of the tiny bones indicates the other twin remained unborn
bones are the oldest example of death by obstructed labour and the earliest known evidence of twins so far
