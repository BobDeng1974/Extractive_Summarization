just when @entity0 thought it was safe to dip their toes back in the choppy @entity4 waters , up popped @entity5 to swamp hopes of registering any sort of victory against the old enemy before the @entity10			1
it was almost as if @entity0 had never been away as , in @entity5 ’s first game of the year , he took them back 12 months to their @entity15 misery with a sensational , match - winning display of extreme fast bowling			1
the man who did most to ensure @entity0 were thrashed 5 - 0 last winter now put their @entity10 hopes into perspective by bursting through the middle order to give @entity22 victory for the third time already on this tour			1
@entity22 's @entity5 ( centre ) celebrates with his team - mates after taking the wicket of @entity29 @entity30 was another victim of @entity5 ( right ) , who celebrates with his arms spread wide at the @entity32 @entity33 ( centre ) was impressive with bat and ball as @entity22 beat @entity0 in the @entity38 final it gave @entity22 the @entity38 title at the @entity32 and a huge psychological advantage ahead of their big date in @entity44 on @entity45 when they open this year ’s @entity10			1
it should be pointed out that @entity5 ’s devastating burst of three wickets in 10 balls on sunday — to virtually end @entity0 ’s hopes of chasing 278 for eight — all came against batsmen who did not play in the @entity15			1
yes , do n’t laugh , they really are			0
they do n’t need to be as good as @entity10 hot - favourites @entity22 to exceed expectations here and do n’t need to peak for at least a month yet			1
they know their best side , with @entity59 and @entity60 cementing their places			0
it would be a surprise if @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 are anything other than subs — but @entity71 could do with a score soon			0
@entity30 can now be considered a front - line spinner in one - day as well as test cricket			0
he may not have fully fired as opener but he can be relied on for 10 economical overs			1
where have we heard that before ? @entity29 ’s two golden ducks against @entity22 are worrying			1
if @entity0 are going to fire in the @entity10 he must be at his best			1
the defending champions wo n’t win it			0
@entity85 , who have been here for nearly three winless months , have been woeful and uninterested in this tournament			0
he was meant to be rusty , easing his way back after a month ’s absence			2
in fact , he was simply too quick and too good for @entity93 , @entity30 and , first ball , captain @entity29 , in a first spell of four highly significant overs			2
it must be said the first of those victims looked unlucky , with tv umpire @entity100 seemingly failing to spot that @entity5 had marginally overstepped , even though the on - field officials had asked him to check for a no - ball			1
@entity22 's players surround @entity5 as @entity29 ( right ) walks back to the clubhouse after being bowled @entity105 holds his bat aloft in celebration after scoring a half - century for @entity22 , against @entity0 @entity59 walks from the crease back towards the pavilion after being dismissed for just eight runs once @entity30 failed to get out of the way of a brutal snorter and @entity29 inexplicably left his first delivery , normal service from the worst tour in @entity0 ’s history had soberingly resumed			1
‘ i ’m finding it hard to put my finger on why we batted like that , ’ said @entity29			2
‘ at no time were we put under pressure			0
we made bad decisions which is disappointing			0
if we play near our capability we will beat them , i ’ve no doubt			0
’ but , surely the @entity5 factor was crucial ? not so , says @entity29			2
‘ he was n’t at the front of our thoughts			0
we talked about the opposition but i do n’t think we were threatened			0
i do n’t think he swung it			0
it could have been anybody bowling			2
we just had a really bad day			0
’ if @entity0 are really not concerned about @entity5 they should be , according to @entity33 , who , if anything , surpassed the fast bowler in scoring 95 and taking four wickets			1
‘ they should be worried about him , ’ said @entity33			2
‘ he tore through them			0
they can be not worried if they like but if they ’re getting skittled by him they probably should be			0
’ @entity71 ( left ) plays a shot during @entity0 's @entity38 final against @entity22 at the @entity32 in @entity147 @entity148 watches his ball race away towards the boundary on his way to 17 runs for @entity0 @entity4 batsman @entity153 shouts after playing a shot in the @entity38 final on february 1 this 112 - run defeat should not be seen as fatal for @entity0 ’s @entity10 hopes because the structure of one - day cricket ’s premier tournament is heavily weighted towards @entity161 teams			1
but the manner of it was poor			0
they reduced @entity22 to 60 for four but hopes were initially dashed by a stand of 141 between @entity33 and @entity105 and then another blast from the past from @entity169			1
@entity169 later walked off with a side injury that could rule him out of the @entity10 , after smashing 50 from 24 balls			2
even so , @entity22 barely reached par. @entity0 regained some hope after they ran out @entity105 who , with @entity33 , put on an impressive show @entity177 ( centre ) celebrates with @entity179 ( left ) and @entity59 ( right ) after dismissing @entity180 @entity33 ( right ) plays a shot past @entity148 on the way to 95 runs - @entity22 's top scoring batsman @entity177 took a big step towards returning to his best with three wickets and @entity30 was once again excellent — but this was a nightmare day for @entity188 , who went wicketless and conceded a thumping 89 runs to record the fourth - worst figures in @entity0 one - day international history			1
when @entity188 was dismissed first ball by the spin of @entity33 his progress had been considerably dented			2
@entity0 ’s hopes of registering what would have been a big victory did not look great when the form man @entity59 edged @entity199 to @entity200			2
then @entity5 showed there has been no lessening of his powers in the last year , at least on the home pitch that suits him perfectly			1
what was less excusable for @entity0 was conceding four wickets to @entity33 , who excelled with ball as well as bat as @entity22 wrapped things up with 65 balls to spare			1
@entity30 ( second left ) celebrates with his @entity0 team - mates after taking a wicket at the @entity32 in @entity147 @entity177 lifts his index finger in celebration after dismissing @entity180 to leave @entity22 on 46 - 3 against @entity0 @entity180 ( left ) was caught and bowled , but @entity22 went on to beat @entity0 in the @entity38 final @entity59 and @entity30 take to the field to open the batting for @entity0 on a warm day in @entity147 , @entity22 on sunday @entity0 have a week off before warm - up games against @entity219 and @entity220 ahead of their reunion with @entity22 at the @entity223			1
@entity5 will be waiting there even though @entity29 was bullish			2
‘ the pressure will build on them as the home team in a @entity10 playing against a dangerous side			0
we ’ll go out with all guns blazing			0
’ it remains to be seen whether that will be enough against what looks like a formidable @entity4 one - day side .			0
