astronomers have found the brightest ‘ dead star ’ ever recorded - but its very existence threatens to undermine our known laws of the universe			1
the pulsar - a dense and rapidly spinning remnant of a much larger star left over from a supernova explosion - has the energy of about 10 million suns and was previously thought to be a black hole			1
its discovery , however , breaks a theoretical limit for how bright such an object can get - and it may also mean many other black holes found to date are actually pulsars			1
scroll down for animations scientists at @entity23 ’s @entity22 have found the brightest pulsar ever recorded			1
high - energy x-rays streaming from a rare and mighty pulsar ( shown in magenta ) , the brightest found to date , can be seen in this image of the @entity29 , also known as @entity29 ( @entity29 ) the discovery , published in the journal nature , was made by scientists at @entity23 ’s @entity22 ( @entity22 ) using the @entity32 ( @entity32 )			1
this pulsar was spotted while astronomers were observing the remnants of a once - in - a - century supernova dubbed @entity37 in the @entity29 , also known as @entity29 ( @entity29 ) , 12 million light - years away			2
the rare event captured the attention of telescopes around the world including @entity32 , and when astronomers looked at the data they found a huge source of x-rays coming from the region			0
when a massive star collapses and explodes as a supernova , its crushed core may survive as a compact remnant called a neutron star or pulsar			1
this is an object squeezing more mass than the sun 's into a sphere the size of @entity59 young pulsars complete a revolution each second , while as they grow older they spin faster and faster , eventually completing thousands of revolutions a second			1
they generate beams of radio waves , visible light , x-rays and gamma rays that astronomers observe as pulses whenever the beams sweep past @entity76			0
pulsars also generate powerful outflows , or ' winds , ' of high - energy particles moving near the speed of light			0
the power for all this comes from the pulsar 's rapidly spinning magnetic field and over time , as the pulsars wind down , these emissions fade			1
more than 30 years ago , astronomers discovered another type of pulsar that completed revolutions in less than 10 milliseconds , reaching incredible rotational speeds of up to 43,000 revolutions per minute			2
this type of star is called a millsecond pulsar			2
while young pulsars usually appear in isolation , more than half of millisecond pulsars occur in binary systems with other stars , which suggests an explanation for their rapid spin			2
at first they thought it was a black hole but , examining the supernova , astronomers noticed pulses of bright x-rays occurring every 1.37 seconds			1
blindingly bright x-rays like this are called ultraluminous x-ray sources ( @entity113 ) and they are normally associated with black holes			1
however , the discovery that this @entity113 was pulsing suggested it was something other than a black hole			1
by cross-examining the source with data from another telescope , @entity123 , astronomers ruled out 25 other sources that it could have been			0
finally , they realised that a pulsar must be the source - and it was revealed to be the brightest pulsar ever discovered			1
‘ that was a big surprise , ’ said dr @entity131 , the principal investigator on @entity32			0
‘ for decades everybody has thought these ultraluminous x-ray sources had to be black holes			1
' but black holes do n't have a way to create this pulsing			1
’ she added : ‘ this compact little stellar remnant is a real powerhouse			0
we 've never seen anything quite like it			0
’ but the discovery has astronomers scratching their heads as , although fascinating , quite how something this bright can form is unknown			2
pulsars are typically between one and two times the mass of the sun. this new pulsar falls in that same mass range , but shines about 100 times brighter than theory suggests something of its mass should be able to			1
‘ we 've never seen a pulsar even close to being this bright , ’ said @entity160 , a postdoctoral scholar at @entity22 who works with @entity32 data			0
‘ honestly , we do n't know how this happens , and theorists will be chewing on it for a long time			0
’ a pulsar ( illustration shown ) is a rapidly spinning remnant of a larger star left after a supernova			1
they are as small as @entity59 but have the mass of the sun. but this pulsar is 100 times brighter than theory says should be possible			1
astronomers previously though the object was a black hole			1
credit : @entity23 / @entity181 - @entity22 the discovery was made using @entity23 's @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , illustration shown			2
the telescope launched on 13 june 2012 and orbits the @entity76 at a height of about 340 miles ( 550km )			0
it is used to focus high - energy x-rays from cosmic sources			0
its mission is expected to end in 2016 @entity32 is particularly well - suited to make discoveries like this one			0
not only does the space telescope see high - energy x-rays , but it sees them in a unique way			0
rather than snapping images the way that your cell - phone camera does - by integrating the light such that images blur if you move - @entity32 detects individual particles of x-ray light and marks when they are measured			0
that allows the team to do timing analyses and , in this case , to see that the light from the @entity113 was coming in pulses			0
the reason most astronomers had assumed black holes were powering these @entity212 is that these x-ray sources are so incredibly bright			1
black holes can be anywhere from 10 to billions of times the mass of the sun , making their gravitational pull much stronger than that of a pulsar			1
as matter falls onto the black hole the gravitational energy turns it to heat , which creates x-ray light			1
the bigger the black hole , the more energy there is to make the object shine			1
the discovery that this @entity113 is a pulsar is therefore baffling			2
it is many times brighter than the @entity232 limit - a basic physics guideline that sets an upper limit on the brightness that an object of a given mass should be able to achieve			1
the pulsar detected is shown in this animation that flips back and forth between images captured by @entity23 's @entity32			2
the animation was created by stacking images taken both while the pulsar was ' on ' and ' off , ' meaning its beams were either pointed toward @entity76 or away from us and not visible			0
credit : @entity23 / @entity181 - @entity22 ‘ this is the most extreme violation of that limit that we 've ever seen , ’ continued mr @entity160			2
‘ we have known that things can go above that by a small amount , but this blows that limit away			0
’ now that the @entity32 team has shown that this @entity113 is a pulsar , dr @entity254 points out that many other known @entity212 may in fact be pulsars as well			0
' everybody had assumed all of these sources were black holes , ' she said			2
' now i think people have to go back to the drawing board and decide whether that 's really true			0
' this could just be a very unique , strange object , or it could be that they 're not that uncommon			0
we just do n't know			0
we need more observations to see if other @entity212 are pulsing			0
' last month a scientist sensationally claimed it is impossible for black holes to exist , based on her mathematical calculations			2
the research was conducted by professor @entity278 from the @entity279 at @entity280 in the @entity281 and scientists			0
she claimed that as a star dies , it releases a type of radiation known as hawking radiation - predicted by professor @entity287			0
however in this process , professor @entity278 believes the star also sheds mass , so much so that it no longer has the density to become a black hole			1
before the black hole can form , she said , the dying star swells and explodes			1
the singularity as predicted never forms , and neither does the event horizon - the boundary of the black hole where not even light can escape			2
‘ i ’m still not over the shock , ’ said professor @entity278			0
‘ we ’ve been studying this problem for a more than 50 years and this solution gives us a lot to think about			0

scientists at @entity23 have discovered the brightest pulsar ever recorded
a pulsar is a rapidly spinning remnant of a larger star left after a supernova
they are the size of @entity59 but have the mass of the sun
but this pulsar is 100 times brighter than theory states should be possible
astronomers previously thought the object was a black hole
its discovery suggests other objects in the universe , thought to be black holes , may also be pulsars
