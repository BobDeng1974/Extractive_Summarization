in @entity2 's time , manners maketh the man and being able to hold a captive and witty conversation was a virtue			1
so just what would the literary legend have made of today 's society where the art of face - to - face communication is being lost to texting and tweeting ? no doubt she may have been as irked as @entity12 , 23 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , who has set up ' a @entity16 ' campaign group to shame people who snub friends and family they are with in favour of checking their mobile phone			1
how rude ! but many brits have admitted they will talk on their phone during dinner and whilst in company it 's a social faux pas that a third of @entity28 polled admitted to in a recent survey , with more than a quarter ( 27 per cent ) saying they would answer their phone in the middle of a face - to - face conversation			1
a third confessed that they would answer the phone in a restaurant and 19 per cent said they would while being served in a shop			0
now @entity38 magazine have imagined just how @entity2 would have satirised those in need of social etiquette when it comes to using their smartphone			2
or , to paraphrase the novelist , how it is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man ( or woman ) in possession of a good smart phone must be in want of manners			0
so here 's ' what @entity2 would do ' when it comes to using your mobile with good manners ... one does not approve : @entity2 was a stickler for social etiquette one must avoid reading emails at mealtimes / social occasions			1
it is phubbing of the highest degree or , as @entity2 might say : ' to sit in the shade on a fine day , and look upon verdure is the most perfect refreshment			1
but it is lost if one is more engrossed in that email @entity70 sent you of a cat falling into a bathtub			0
' one must not leave a missed call without an answerphone message or text or , as @entity2 might say : ' one half of the world can not understand the pleasures of the other			2
so how in @entity83 's name do you expect us to know what you were calling about if there is but no intimation of your purpose ? ' one must use @entity89 with great care - instead of sharing every waking thought or decision with a group or , as @entity2 might say : ' you have delighted us long enough			2
' one must not put non-verbal things on the phone - like a cat or newborn baby			0
especially when you are calling them long distance			0
( ' hi mr @entity100			0
our conversation is costing me 43p per minute ' ) or , as @entity2 might say : ' my idea of good company is the company of clever , well - informed people , who have a great deal of conversation ; that is what i call good company			1
' one must always say goodbye when hanging up or as @entity2 might say : ' you hung up on me ? badly done , @entity113 ! '			0

art of conversation being lost
