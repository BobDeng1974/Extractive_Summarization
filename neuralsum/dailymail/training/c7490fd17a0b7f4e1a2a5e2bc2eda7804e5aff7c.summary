welcome to the deserted @entity1 settlement of @entity2 , around 800 miles from the @entity3 and literally frozen in time			1
this ghost town is in fact in @entity6 - on @entity8 island in the @entity9 - where @entity10 retains rights to occupy the icy territory			1
no - one has lived permanently in @entity2 since 1998 and it is now a bizarre tourist attraction offering the world 's most northerly @entity17 monument			1
frozen in time : the @entity1 settlement of @entity2 is around 800 miles from the @entity3 and has been abandoned since 1998 isolated : @entity2 ( @entity21 ) was founded in 1910 by @entity22 and sold to the @entity1 in 1927			1
it is named after a nearby pyramid - shaped mountain			2
these pictures were taken this spring by @entity26 , a @entity10 guide cut - off : the guide regularly visits the one place in @entity2 where , on a good day , he might be lucky to catch a signal for his mobile from @entity6 settlements on @entity8 these remarkable pictures of the timewarp town are from @entity26 , 33 , a @entity10 guide who worked in this lonely outpost earlier this year			1
' welcome to the very end of the earth , ' said mr @entity26 , whose amazing images capture a lost @entity1 world			1
alone between trips from hardy tourists , he lives at abandoned @entity45 , and his only friend is an @entity9 fox who joins him for breakfast			1
two 's company : mr @entity26 feeds his pet arctic fox @entity52 who is only friend in the settlement			1
the creature regularly joins him for breakfast prepared : mr @entity26 's daily equipment which include an anti polar bear gun tour guide : @entity26 poses for a selfie in the gym mirror ( left ) and then makes use of some of the equipment that was left behind when everyone moved out clean : @entity26 's room at the tulip is still in good condition despite the last paying guests checking out many years before the pictures were taken this spring			1
' the sun has been shining since 4 - 30am			1
soon it will start shining 24/7 , ' said mr @entity26			1
he regularly visits the one place in @entity2 where , on a good day , he might be lucky to catch a signal for his mobile from @entity6 settlements on @entity8			1
' there are no radio , tv , internet in the village			0
however we can try to catch a signal from @entity6 in the so - called ' emotional spot ' or ' spot of hope ' , ' he said			1
' it is marked by a pole			0
' it 's a tricky business			0
' the battery runs down before the fingers get frozen , you can never know which one will give up first - your fingers or a battery of your mobile , ' he explained			2

it housed unmarried men when the community was a thriving settlement			0
blast from the past : a tourist poses with an unusual item in the music hall in the abandoned village			2
yellowing sheet music still lies on the piano left behind : this factory looks as if it could have been abandoned a few months ago and many items , including machinery , are still in place empty : a local canteen located between hostel for men and hostel for women shoe mountain : a stack of abandoned footwear litters the scuffed floor in the gym derelict : an abandoned gym in the village which has been left to rust ' the bigger house to the right was called ' @entity133 ' , it was inhabited by single women			0
there is a canteen between the two houses , probably to give a chance the unattached to meet			0
' the thermometer reads minus @entity141 in the sun but mr @entity26 calls this ' optimistic ' since it feels cooler with the wind chill			1
in a garage he finds a 22 year old @entity145 , called a ' limo ' by the @entity6 visitors			2
a sign commemorates @entity150 's trip to space in april 1961 , and while the town was abandoned seven years after the fall of the red flag , everything about it has the stamp of @entity158 about it			2
waiting for his tourists to arrive , he finds random traces of what was once a thriving @entity1 town			2
old film reel , snow boots , explosives devices , a 25 metre swimming pool the tourists like to visit the old works canteen , once open day and night , where the food was free to hardy workers willing to work in this icy climate			0
and also ' the most polar @entity17 in the world '			0
' the northernmost @entity17 looks a bit crazy , does n't he ? ' asks mr @entity26			2
this ghost town is in fact in @entity6 - on @entity8 island in the @entity9 - where @entity10 retains rights to occupy the icy territory			1
lonely : these remarkable pictures of the timewarp town are from @entity26 , 33 , a @entity10 guide who worked in this lonely outpost earlier this year the ghost town , which once boasted 1,000 people , is reputed to maintain the world 's most northern grand piano in the cultural centre			1
' it used to be a @entity1 paradise in the 1970s and 1980s with a nursery , a school , a sports and entertainment centre , a warm swimming pool covered with a roof made of @entity195 birch , ' said a report on @entity200 in @entity10			0

but all the people have left			0
' the last tone of coal was lifted on 31 march 1998			0
' this tv report accused early tourists of looting the town - ' they took away all they could carry ' , including library books and parquet flooring			2

a small number of residents do now live here in order to maintain facilities needed for tourists to visit a town literally frozen in time			0
experts say it is the cold temperatures that have helped to preserve buildings that would otherwise have deteriorated in the 15 years since the @entity274 pulled the plug on this relic of @entity278 's industrialisation of @entity10 .			0
