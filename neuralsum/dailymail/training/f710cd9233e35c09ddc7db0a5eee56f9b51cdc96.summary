@entity0 will cut the scenes featuring guns from the trailer of @entity4 following the horrific shooting spree at a midnight showing in @entity6 that left 12 cinema - goers dead			1
the studio 's bosses met on friday at its @entity10 , @entity11 offices to discuss whether to go ahead with the move in response to the massacre			1
a source told @entity16 that executives are hoping to replace the old trailers as quickly as possible			2
however , the studio risks losing millions in what is regarded as the biggest release of the year so far - and which has been predicted to be one of the highest earning movies of all time			1
speculation : a poster for @entity4 is displayed at @entity0 studios in @entity10 , @entity28 he studio is considering whether to pull screenings following shootings at the film in @entity34 representatives for the movie studio did not immediately respond to @entity37 for comment			1
a lack of sensitivity could enrage the families of victims and alienate future viewers			2
whether audiences members continue to flock to the movie or not , @entity4 will always be associated with the violent gun attack			1
and @entity0 , which has made billions from selling violent movies to families and their children , faces the prospect of seeing the blockbuster sink at box offices across the country			1
the studio has already cancelled the star - studded premiere in @entity57 on friday night , and now bosses are deciding whether to take further measures , an executive told @entity60			1
it has also cancelled two versions of adverts for the film , @entity61 reported			2
it seems a wise decision as one character , @entity66 , wears a face mask similar to the @entity34 shooter 's in the trailer			1
and as horrifying details of the massacre emerge , the studio has also pulled the trailer for its forthcoming film , @entity75 , due to a scene that shows gunmen opening fire in a cinema			1
losses : the company could lose millions if screenings do not go ahead for the biggest film of the year fate : @entity85 stars as @entity86 in the @entity0 film			1
the studio has already cancelled some ads ' we will continue to monitor the situation and adjust our security needs as necessary , ' a spokesman from @entity92 theatres added , among increased speculation that entire chains could pull the film			1
@entity101 cinema massacre may have been inspired by a @entity86 comic book strip , it emerged on friday			1
the bloodbath is a chilling copycat of a 25 - year - old @entity86 comic strip which features a deranged gunman opening fire in a cinema			2
in the second issue of @entity110 , written by @entity111 - the creative mind behind @entity113 and 300 - gunman @entity114 opens fire in a pornographic theatre , killing three people , after listening to @entity119 's classic track ' @entity120			0
' text from the page reads : ' @entity124 fingers the cold steel thing in his pocket and stares at the movie marquee and does not throw up			1
' he thinks about @entity119 and how they are trying to kill him			0
' he had not known about @entity119 until father @entity131 had explained it last night			0
' father @entity131 said that @entity119 hid a prayer to @entity135 in their song @entity120			0
' they hid it very well			0
' @entity114 took the album from the record store where he worked until they fired him this afternoon and transferred @entity120 to tape			0
' then he played the tape backwards			0
he played it forty - seven times until he was absolutely certain that father @entity131 was right			0
' @entity124 then walks into a cinema , which is screening a pornographic film called @entity135 , and opens fire			0
@entity149 motives behind the massacre are unknown , but if he was a fan of the @entity86 comics , then he may well have read the issue featuring @entity124 's killing - spree			1
around 3,825 cinemas held screenings on midnight on thursday - making a staggering $ 30.6 million - and the film was expected to reach 4,404 theaters across the country and 6,765 screens overseas			0
box office analysts predicted it would make as much as $ 198 million in its first weekend , making it the best @entity162 opening ever for a non- 3d movie , @entity60 reported			1
the studio will no doubt feel the heat as the film , directed by @entity167 , had a budget of $ 250 million and worldwide marketing expenses could drive the total cost up to $ 400 million			2
the studio has been @entity172 's @entity171 for years , generating worldwide ticket sales of $ 12 billion from its @entity174 , @entity86 and @entity176 films			1
@entity4 will be the last of the @entity86 franchise which began in 2005			0
franchise films are especially important to studios , which use big - budget movies to create theme park rides and sell toys and merchandise			0
but this recent tragedy could rattle their earnings			0
@entity0 released a statement earlier on friday , which said : ' @entity0 and the filmmakers are deeply saddened to learn about this shocking incident			1
' we extend our sincere sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims at this tragic time			0
' if screenings do go ahead , cinemas and police departments across the country have vowed to protect cinema goers from potential copy - cat attacks			0
in @entity204 , police commissioner @entity203 said his department would provide coverage at theaters where the film is playing			0
@entity209 said it would not accept face - masks , costumes or fake guns inside theatres to make all cinema - goers feel comfortable			2
major movie theatre chain @entity215 said it will use both uniformed security and plainclothes officers on top of its hidden security procedures ' not in the sight of our guests '			2
captain @entity223 of the @entity224 added to @entity225 : ' while the tragedy in @entity229 , @entity6 , appears to be an isolated incident , our vigilance has been raised			0
scene of terror : the cinema in @entity229 , @entity6 , where a gunman killed 12 people and injured 59 at a midnight showing of @entity4 ' the heightened alert includes increased patrols to create a more visible presence at movie theatres and other places where people congregate			1
' the @entity57 premier was originally scheduled to take place on friday night with @entity167 and the film 's stars @entity85 and @entity247 in attendance			0
but earlier in the day , workers took down a massive @entity86 mask mounted on the front of a cinema along the @entity253 , where the screening had been planned			0
@entity0 also pulled an interview with @entity257 actress @entity256 , who features in the film , on @entity259 , the country 's most popular channel			1
they have also cancelled the trailer for @entity75 due to footage showing characters firing in a cinema - an erie premonition of the shooting spree at the hands of @entity149 in @entity229			2
shooting spree : @entity149 , pictured left and right in 2006 , allegedly bought a ticket for the film before donning ballistic gear , throwing a smoke bomb into the audience and shooting at random he is reported to have opened fire at a cinema after buying a ticket to the midnight screening of the film and killing 12 people , including a 12 - year - old			1
the footage , which occurs at around the two minute mark , shows several gangsters shooting behind the big screen , before bursting through it , taking aim at moviegoers			0
the clip shows those inside the theatre panicking and screaming as machine guns are shot			2
the film stars @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 and @entity296 and tells the story of the @entity299 's fight with the @entity300 to keep them out of @entity301 in the 1940s and 1950s			0
although @entity75 had been due to be shown before @entity4 in cinemas across the @entity162 , it had not been shown before today 's shooting in @entity229 , the studio told @entity225 news			2
it is just one example of the violence prevalent in movies fronted by @entity172 's biggest names			2
tragic parallel : @entity0 has now pulled its trailer for @entity75 appearing before the @entity4 in cinemas across the country due to a scene where a gunman fires at an audience there have been fears in the past that such films or tv shows could spark copycat attacks , including horrors such as @entity327 ( 1996 ) and dramas such as @entity329 ( 1978 )			1
in 2004 , @entity330 , 25 , claimed @entity331 inspired him to go on a three day killing rampage in the south of @entity334 that left four people dead			1
he said he hoped to be like the film 's character @entity336			0
and in 2010 , @entity338 , 17 , from @entity339 told police he identified with the lead character in @entity342 , a tv series about a forensic expert who moonlights as a serial killer			0
he was charged with killing his 10 - year - old brother			0
the films in the @entity86 franchise are similarly gory ; in @entity101 , audiences watch as a man 's face is filleted by a knife and a bomb is sewn into another man 's stomach , before it explodes			1
despite numerous brutal and gruesome scenes , children were allowed to view the film if they attended with their parents .			2

@entity0 said to be cutting scenes with guns from @entity101 trailer
studio set to lose millions in biggest release as movie will always be associated with massacre that left 12 dead
