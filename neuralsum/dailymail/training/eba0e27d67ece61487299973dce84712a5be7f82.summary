it was just over a year ago this week that @entity1 and @entity2 finally decided they had perhaps had enough of @entity4			1
when the talented but unreliable young winger turned up 45 minutes late for a reserve game at @entity9 , the reigning @entity6 champions chose to move him on			0
it was not the first time @entity12 had erred in this way and it was not just at @entity15 where he could not be relied upon			2
he had been known to keep people waiting for hours to see him at his house , too			0
over time , things like this get you a reputation that is hard to shake			0
take this anecdote from one @entity6 manager from last january 's transfer window			2
linked with a loan move for @entity12 , i asked him what his intentions were			2
@entity12 completed a permanent move back to @entity33 on monday @entity12 celebrated with fellow loanee @entity34 as @entity33 made it through to the @entity37 fifth round @entity12 failed to make an impact following his £ 10m move to @entity2 in january 2013 former @entity2 boss @entity1 soon realised in training that @entity12 was not for him appearances @entity6 - 0 ( 2 as sub ) , 28 minutes @entity37 - 0 ( 0 ) @entity44 - 1 ( 0 ) , 78 minutes @entity45 - 0 ( 0 ) @entity46 - 1 ( 0 ) , 61 minutes ' yeah i was looking at it , ' he said candidly			1
' but i know one of the backroom staff at @entity2 and they have told me not to go near him			1
' they say he is good enough but he is n't doing things right			0
' that final sentence perhaps sums up @entity12 's short career at @entity15			1
he has played for @entity58 and will now continue his career as a @entity6 player with @entity33			2
but @entity12 's application and attitude – at least among last season 's management set - up at @entity2 – was never considered to be right			1
he played 22 minutes against @entity65 and six against @entity66 in the @entity6 before heading to @entity67			0
how relevant things like time keeping are to what happens on a football field depends on your point of view			0
however , the prevalent view among most at the top level these days is that if you ca n't get the small things right then what chance have you with the big things ? @entity12 poses with former @entity2 manager @entity1 after linking up with the squad in the summer of 2013 the 22 - year - old only made two @entity6 appearances for @entity2 @entity12 did impress during the 2013 pre-season tour of @entity83 and @entity84 but it did n't last @entity12 revealed his move to @entity2 by claiming he was ' on his way to the top of the @entity6 ' and when members of your own club are privately warning friends in the game not to touch you then it 's time to accept you have some issues to address			1
certainly when sir @entity99 signed him for £ 10million from @entity33 two years ago , eyebrows were raised throughout the game			1
then just 20 , the gifted forward had already earned something of a mixed reputation , depending on who you talked to			0
@entity99 , for sure , would have backed himself to fix him			0
but , then , @entity99 was n't sticking around beyond the season 's end so why sign him and leave him for somebody else to handle ? @entity12 was instrumental during @entity33 's play - off winning season in 2013 @entity12 returned to @entity33 on loan this season after @entity114 deemed him surplus to requirements @entity12 has made two appearances for @entity58 after making his debut against @entity120 in 2012 only four players from the team that started their 4 - 0 defeat by @entity124 are still at @entity15 that is one of the more peculiar – and unanswerable – parts of the whole affair			1
for @entity1 , it was a hospital pass and one that @entity99 's replacement soon realised he had little interest in taking			2
short of players because of injuries , @entity1 used @entity12 on a pre-season tour of @entity83 and @entity84 in 2013 and the new signing impressed			1
but the environs of a summer tour are far removed from the reality of daily life at a @entity6 club and – once he saw him on the training ground regularly – @entity1 began to realise he was n't for him			2
senior @entity2 players did n't disagree , either			0
players like @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 questioned much of what went on during @entity1 ' brief spell at the club but there were precious few dissenting voices when it came to the distance the @entity2 manager put between @entity156 and the first - team picture			1
there were other niggling issues , too			0
@entity12 and @entity1 fell out over the business of the player 's company car , for example , something that still had n't been resolved at the time @entity12 eventually moved to @entity67 on loan this time last year			1
from his point of view , @entity12 felt he was never given a chance at @entity15			0
speaking on last summer 's tour of @entity170 , he vowed to do all he could to impress current manager @entity114			1
he was reluctant to criticise @entity1 and deserves credit for that			0
@entity12 has been rejuvenated since @entity174 's appointment as @entity33 manager in december @entity12 was loaned out to @entity67 last january after failing to make an impact at @entity2 ultimately , though , @entity12 's chance of establishing himself as a @entity2 player has now gone			1
maybe it just came too soon for him			0
maybe @entity1 was just the wrong manager but now @entity183 has passed similar judgement			2
@entity12 's form and application has by all accounts been good while on loan at @entity33 this season			1
maybe a lesson has been learned			0
at @entity15 , though , he will forever be consigned to a list labelled ' mistake ' .			0

@entity4 signed for @entity2 in january 2013 for £ 10m
he was instantly loaned back to @entity33 as part of the deal
after joining @entity2 in the summer of 2013 @entity12 impressed pre-season
@entity1 soon realised the *tricky* winger was not for him
@entity12 's application and attitude was criticised by backroom staff at @entity2
he was loaned to @entity67 in january 2014
@entity12 was again loaned out by new manager @entity114
the winger has now joined @entity33 on a permanent deal
