@entity7 said she asked the school for permission to ' prompose ' on campus and they gave it to her - until they found out who she was asking
the school district said it does not allow any one to prompose - where students ask a date to prom in a *lavish* way - on campus
but @entity7 said she has seen other students carry them out
she said she plans to go to the prom with her girlfriend anyway
