@entity1 and his beloved dog @entity0 who @entity3 was able to save from being put down rufus the rabbit should not be here			1
the three - month - old pet fell out of his hutch and shattered his leg , a fatal injury for most rabbits as the bones are too small to fix			0
they are usually put to sleep			1
but @entity14 is bouncing with health , and eager to explore			0
vet @entity16 holds him securely			1
' @entity14 thinks he 's fixed and he wants to hop around the room ... but @entity14 has n't seen the x-ray pictures			2
' those x-rays are extraordinary , proving why animal lovers know @entity3 as the @entity21			1
@entity14 has had two metal plates implanted in his leg , fixed with 12 screws in a bone thinner than a matchstick			0
' it was like drilling into cottage cheese , ' @entity3 says candidly			1
@entity3 , whose work is explored in a new @entity31 series , is on a mission to rescue animals like @entity14 , the ones that conventional veterinary science agrees can not be saved			1
his signature is the bionic op , where mechanical body parts are integrated with the animal 's living skeleton to replace a paw or a leg			1
this pushes medical technology to the limit			0
' the op i do is n't yet performed on humans , ' he says			2
' i hope the technology will one day help human amputees such as war veterans			0
' at the suggestion that people should get this revolutionary technology before animals , he becomes hyper - voluble			2
' for a long time humans have taken for granted that they can have surgery made possible by experiments on animals , but the animals do n't benefit			2
my purpose is to tell people about unconditional love for animals			0
this is the essence of life			0
' in the first episode of @entity21 , an eight - year - old @entity66 called @entity67 is referred to him			1
@entity67 has cancer , with a leg tumour that has left his bone looking moth - eaten			0
@entity16 with @entity73 the cat who he gave a pair of prosthetic paws the dog is in pain , but the family do n't want to lose him - their son @entity81 , 11 , is devoted to his pet and his dad @entity84 is in tears too			1
there is no false hope for this family , and some scenes make difficult viewing			0
by amputating the diseased leg , @entity3 can bring @entity67 a stay of execution - fitting an expensive prosthetic would bring unnecessary suffering			2
but on three legs , @entity67 is able to enjoy life again			0
' it 's a big responsibility , ' @entity3 admits			1
' you 're holding people 's emotions in the palm of your hand			0
' weekend 's gardening expert @entity104 has personal experience of @entity3 's miracle touch			1
his golden retriever @entity0 was paralysed when he burst a spinal disc and faced being put to sleep			2
in desperation , and on the recommendation of a friend , @entity1 contacted @entity3 - and received a return email within minutes : ' bring the dog to me			1
' six days later , after an intensive course of hydrotherapy and drugs , @entity0 was back on all four paws			0
' @entity3 is a brilliant technician but also a deeply emotional man , ' says @entity1 , with unfeigned admiration			1
whether it 's a cat with metal blades for back legs or a tortoise with a wheel on his shell , @entity3 wants to restore them to health - even if he has to invent a new solution			1
' people said this was impossible , ' he says , surveying his operating rooms			0
' but everything is impossible until we make it possible			0
' @entity21 starts on @entity31 in may .			2

@entity16 is known by animal lovers as the @entity21
his revolutionary operations are yet to be used on humans
@entity3 saved @entity1 's @entity147 from being put to sleep
