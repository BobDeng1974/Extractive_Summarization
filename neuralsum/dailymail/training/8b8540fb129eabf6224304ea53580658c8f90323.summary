@entity0 will be a keen observer when the shootout between @entity3 ’s guns starts in @entity4			1
@entity5 and @entity6 have thrived under @entity0 ’ guidance last season , scoring 51 goals in the @entity10 , but there will be no love lost this evening when @entity16 and @entity17 attempt to save their @entity14 dreams			1
when they come face - to - face , there will be nothing other than a cursory handshake			2
@entity0 has never described them as being a natural partnership , believing they are two forwards who have slotted into a system and he is intrigued to see which man will cope best with the high - pressure demands			1
‘ they ’re both different , ’ @entity0 explained			1
‘ they are two different players with two different sets of qualities			0
' @entity5 has got a lot more experience ( at international level )			2
i ’m just interested to see how @entity6 copes			2
‘ i think the key with him is playing in the right position			0
he can play out of position in certain situations and certain games			0
the problem you have at that level is you do n’t get a second chance			0
‘ he is best through the middle			0
@entity63 is also best through the middle , maybe dropping in , so it ’s looking at where his strengths are as a player			0
@entity5 can play in a number of positions so it ’ll be fascinating to see the two goalscorers			2
’ and is the rivalry between them healthy ? @entity0 replied : “ of course – all strikers want to be the number nine ; they want to finish as top scorer			1
they want to be the kings			0
’ anticipating : @entity3 boss @entity0 says ' all strikers want to be the number nine ' in a team			1
