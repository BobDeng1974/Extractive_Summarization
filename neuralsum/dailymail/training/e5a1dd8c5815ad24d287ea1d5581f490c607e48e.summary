@entity1 boss @entity0 says the club tried ' everything ' they could to keep hold of @entity5 before his £ 75million move to @entity7			1
and @entity0 does not see @entity5 's @entity8 bite on @entity9 as the reason behind his move			1
@entity7 announced on wednesday that the controversial @entity12 was ' 100 per cent ' a @entity7 player , although the striker was conspicuous by his absence at a press conference			2
pals : @entity0 congratulates @entity5 after he scored a hat - trick against @entity20 last season latest star : @entity5 's new no 9 shirt is already on sale at @entity7 's club shot at the @entity25 that was , of course , due to his four - month @entity29 ban from all football - related activity after biting @entity32 defender @entity9 's shoulder			1
the incident , the third time in @entity5 's career that he had been banned for biting , prompted many in the game to urge @entity0 to get rid of his star forward before the start of the season			1
but the @entity42 is adamant that the 27 - year - old 's exit was more down to his desire to move to @entity46 than his antics in @entity48			2
thumbs up : @entity5 pictured wearing the famous colours of the @entity51 giants back in the day : @entity5 at his @entity1 unveiling in 2011 - alongside @entity53 and @entity54 seeing is believing : @entity5 was voted @entity56 last season after a stunning campaign with @entity1 ' we did everything we could as a club to keep @entity5 , ' he told the @entity62			1
' he wanted to go and play in @entity63 , and unfortunately when a player no longer wants to play for you , we need as a club to look at it			0
' it was his decision for him to go , he 's gone to @entity7 , a club he wanted to play for and now we 'll move on			2
' i 'm not sure if he would have gone regardless of the @entity8			0
but i never felt that towards the end of the season , and likewise he never said he would give us another year either			0
he had obviously signed a new deal so we had that			0
painful blow : @entity5 's bite on @entity9 led to him getting his four - month ban from football - related activity new boy : @entity79 new boy : @entity80 new boy : @entity81 new boy : @entity82 ' but i think we have had great service out of @entity5 and it 's one that we ca n't worry too much about now , it 's done , it 's gone and our focus is here			1
' there is a lot of work going on with the recruitment team in terms of getting in the right player and i am sure we can identify that			0
' this club and many other clubs have shown over a period of time you move on , and believe me , it will be a really exciting season for us			0
' @entity5 will be ineligible to play for @entity7 , who reportedly paid £ 75million for his services - or even to train with his team - mates - unless any appeal lodged with the @entity105 ( @entity105 ) is successful			0
@entity107 grin : @entity5 was a key player in @entity0 ' side and he will be hard pushed to find a replacement			2

@entity1 boss believes bite on @entity9 did not influence move
@entity5 's move was announced on wednesday but he could not be unveiled
@entity0 says ' a lot of work ' is going towards finding a new striker
