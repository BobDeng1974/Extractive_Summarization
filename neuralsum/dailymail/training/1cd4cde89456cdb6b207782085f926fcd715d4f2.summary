deep within a @entity1 fell , my head torch flickers as i cling to a rock , heart in mouth			2
taking a deep breath , i launch myself into @entity9 ’s newly opened climbing experience , near @entity10			1
it is an underground version of their celebrated @entity12 , where willing victims are clamped to the cliff face			2
but this is an all - weather sport , as the mine maintains a constant temperature of @entity19 all year round			1
metal footholds and cables have been hammered into the walls of vast caverns - blasted open for their precious green slate throughout the centuries			2
first mined by the @entity41 , @entity40 is @entity43 ’s last working slate mine , with 11 miles of tunnels chipped into the 2,126 ft - high @entity45 , and more still being discovered			1
hold on tightly : visitors can clamber through an underground world that was mined by the @entity41 the section that forms the climb @entity49 experience was last worked in 1966 and everywhere you notice the rusting remnants of its past - from old pulleys to decayed pipes			0
the beam from my head torch picks up a spade , flung on the ground as though its owner had just popped out for a tea break			0
low tunnels link the three main climbing caverns , most with tracks running through them on the ground			1
‘ you ’d never be standing upright inside the tunnels , ’ @entity26 says , his words echoing as we duck down			0
‘ you ’d always be stooped from the effort of pushing a cart full of slate out of the mine on these tracks			1
’ on track : the defunct mine makes for one of @entity43 's more imaginative venues for a thrilling day out mining has a long tradition in @entity26 ’s family - his uncle and grandfather were rivers , splitting blocks of green slate into thin sheets that could then be shaped into everything from roof tiles to headstones			1
as mine manager , @entity26 now oversees the blasts - but he also finds peace inside the impossibly black caves , silent but for the occasional drip of water			2
‘ sometimes i go deep in the tunnels , turn my torch off and see if i can find my way out using the breeze from the entrance , ’ he says			0
on the outside : @entity9 is located within glorious @entity106 scenery i soon see what he means as the cold air stings my face the closer we get to one of the mine ’s exits , emerging to a dramatic mountain pass view with rugged grey cliffs unfurling beneath us			1
i ’m thankful to be back on terra firma at @entity119 , a former country house in nearby @entity120 and reward my efforts with a steak and cheese board served , fittingly , on @entity40 slate			0
