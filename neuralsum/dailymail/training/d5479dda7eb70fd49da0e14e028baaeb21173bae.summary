by @entity1 reporter published : 06:34 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 21:00 est , 23 january 2014 as politicians take sides in the great @entity7 jobs for @entity7 workers debate , this is one vacancy which was not so hotly contested			1
@entity10 @entity9 started out like thousands of her compatriots , coming to the @entity7 for work when border restrictions were lifted on january 1			1
but it is unlikely anyone would begrudge her the job she found … having flaming knives thrown at her			1
far from being concerned for her safety , miss @entity9 , whose hometown of @entity21 boasts @entity42 ’s grave , says it is her perfect job			1
she said : ‘ i ’ve always loved the circus , and as a child i hoped that one day i would be part of it			1
as soon as i read about the @entity25 on the internet , i knew it was perfect			2
it combines all of my passions : horror , travelling and the circus			1
‘ i never imagined i ’d actually be working with them			2
’ she initially answered an advertisement for an office job at the company			2
however , by the end of an interview , she had accepted a job as the knife thrower ’s assistant instead			2
@entity9 , who worked as a housekeeper and a babysitter in @entity10 , admits she is n't sure how future boyfriends will react to her job hold still ! one person who is still worried about her unusual career choice is her mother two days after arriving in the @entity7 on january 8 , miss @entity9 made her dramatic debut to a packed house in @entity71			1
she said : ‘ i was so excited on my first day that i did n’t think much about the dangers			0
of course i was a bit afraid , but i ’ve got used to it now			0
‘ only two people have been hit in the last 20 years , so i think my odds are good			0
i just relax and get on with it			0
i even keep my eyes open			0
i ’d much rather see the knives coming at me so i know where they ’re coming from			1
’ she added : ‘ if you value your life , you will naturally not move ! ’ one person who is still worried about her unusual career choice is her mother , who miss @entity9 said is more than a little apprehensive – and possibly a bit confused as to how it could have happened , as she used to have a far more prosaic job as a housekeeper and babysitter			1
her two brothers work as a driver and a lawyer , and her sister has started a family			0
she remains unfazed by the dangers			0
‘ i have complete trust in the team , as they are professionals and have been trained			0
’ however , she is n’t sure how any future boyfriends will react			0
‘ i think they will assume i am either very interesting or very crazy ! ’			0

@entity9 , 27 , came to @entity7 so she could join @entity32 circus
