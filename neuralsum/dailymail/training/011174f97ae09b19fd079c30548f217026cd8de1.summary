@entity0 , the chef behind @entity2 's indomitable pastry craze , @entity3 , is trying to crack down on scalpers and also warn customers about the dangers of accepting second hand food			1
with only 200 cronuts made per day , and a line 40 - people deep before the @entity13 bakery even opens its doors , the $ 5 croissant - donut hybrid has become a hot commodity for sweet - toothed @entity2			1
and now a new delivery service , @entity17 , which has no affiliation with the bakery , is charging $ 100 for delivering just one @entity3 , $ 200 for two , or $ 3,000 for ten			2
perfect pastry : the $ 5 @entity21 was quietly unveiled by @entity2 's @entity0 on may 10 , and now a new delivery service which has no affiliation with the bakery , is charging $ 100 for delivering just one @entity21 despite mr @entity0 enforcing a two - @entity3 per customer limit in an effort to ward off scalping schemes , the delivery company continues to make five deliveries every weekday			1
although the chef has previously personally thrown scalpers out of the long morning lines , his major concern about third - party delivery is actually food safety			1
' i do n’t know much about the delivery service , but i do hope they give people some sort of guarantee for hygiene , ' he told @entity45			0
' here at the bakery , we have to answer to the @entity48 , but once it ’s out of our doors , i ca n’t guarantee it has n’t been handled or ( even worse ) , left out for days			2
@entity3 should only be eaten on the day of			0
' to deter @entity21 opportunists , bakery staff members actively police the queue for scalpers			1
recipe to success : the cronut is made from thin layers of flaky croissant dough that are deep fried , rolled in rose sugar , and then filled with light @entity63 vanilla cream sweet and soft : rose - flavored glaze thinly coats the top layer , which peels apart like those in a mille crepe cake ; finally , crystallized rose petals add a garnish flourish ' i open the door for everyone every morning at 8am			1
and i say ‘ hello ’ to all my customers , ' explained mr @entity0			1
' it ’s only a matter a time before something seems kind of shady			0
' he recalled the first time he was confronted with a scalper , who he said was ' was obviously drunk , ' adding , ' it scared me to think someone bought second - hand food off of him			2
' last month , @entity3 were selling up to eight times their original retail price on @entity88 , available for delivery by scalpers in @entity13 ( $ 20 each ) , @entity91 ( $ 30 each ) , and @entity92 $ 40 each )			2
after the @entity21 was quietly unveiled on may 10 , with a small batch of 50 , by may 13 , 200 had sold out by 9.30am			1
one disappointed customer even ' flipped the finger ' at staff on his way out of the pâtisserie			0
in the making : it took around ten recipes , and multiple time and temperature adjustments before mr @entity0 found ' the trick ' to sheeting and frying the dough in grape - seed oil at one specific , and secret , temperature the bakery 's owner and chef , @entity0 , told @entity112 last month that while he 's flattered , the re-selling is illegal			1
' $ 20 for a @entity21			1
that 's a 400 % profit ! ' he exclaimed , adding , ' a lot of people ask me why we do n't just do more ? ' well , i 'm a big fan of quality over quantity			2
it takes a lot to ensure all our other pastries are up to par with standards as well			0
' the @entity21 , which is now trademarked to @entity0 after interest from curious pastry chefs in @entity129 , @entity130 , and @entity131 , is made from thin layers of flaky croissant dough that are deep fried , rolled in rose sugar , and then filled with light tahitian vanilla cream			1
culinary magician : chef @entity0 , pictured in his kitchen , was named @entity140 's best pastry chef by the @entity141 earlier this year hot spot : the @entity0 opened in @entity2 's @entity143 in 2011 rose - flavored glaze thinly coats the top layer , which peels apart like those in a mille crepe cake ; finally , crystallized rose petals add a garnish flourish			1
' a cronut is not as simple as frying up some croissant dough , ' said the chef			0
' we actually make a special laminated dough that is sheeted and folded different than a croissant '			0
the bakery , which opened in @entity2 's @entity143 in 2011 , makes the @entity21 dough fresh daily in house , as well as the flavored sugars and vanilla ganache			1
' @entity162 but chewy , a little heavier than a croissant but fluffier than a donut ' - @entity165 , @entity167 reporter ' @entity168 ' - @entity169 , @entity112 assistant photo editor ' the soft crunch was followed by an injection of cream and a whiff of a rose garden – thanks to the floral - infused icing			0
the perfect breakfast sandwich ! ' - @entity179 , @entity181 ’s an element of the éclair about it , with the vanilla cream inside , which is n’t too sweet , allowing the rose icing to provide the sugar hit alone			0
they 're insanely addictive – mine disappeared in microseconds			0
i could have devoured the box			0
' - @entity191 , @entity167 editor ' that 's why the batches are limited			2
hopefully people will bear with us as we try to ramp up production , ' the chef explained			0
with such a swift reaction to the new pastry , mr @entity0 has filed a trademark for the cronut , ' just for our protection , ' he said			2
it took around ten recipes , and multiple time and temperature adjustments before mr @entity0 found ' the trick ' to sheeting and frying the dough in grape - seed oil at one specific , and secret , temperature			1
for the month of may , @entity0 bakery is selling a @entity21			1
in june , the store will launch a new flavor : @entity216			0
and a new flavor every month after that			0
a quick quote from the chef : ' a few tips on how to eat the @entity21			1
please cut ( if you must ) with a serrated knife to avoid crushing the layers			0
' do not eat the next day , eat immediately ( they have a six hour shelf life ) and will get stale in the fridge			0
' finally , try peeling off the layers one by one like a mille crepe cake			0
' @entity0 , 189 @entity229 , @entity2 , @entity230 10012 .			2

@entity0 now has a two - @entity21 per person limit
the chef personally kicks scalpers out of the bakery 's long line each morning
