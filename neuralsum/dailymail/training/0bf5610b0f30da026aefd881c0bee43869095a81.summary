@entity0 claims @entity1 would never have mounted their unexpected title challenge last season without him			1
the @entity4 international scored 31 @entity7 goals as the @entity8 finished runners - up to @entity10 and insists he left @entity12 a happy man this summer , when a Â£ 75million deal took him to @entity15			1
that contrasted sharply with his feelings at the start of his final campaign in @entity22 , for which he was suspended as he was still serving some of his 10 - game ban for biting @entity25 's @entity24 , and he was made to train on his own after trying to manufacture a move away			0

' i appreciate all the work the team did but i missed six matches and scored all those goals in the @entity7 without being the penalty - taker , ' @entity0 told @entity15 's official website			1
' the truth is that i left very happy because if i had n't had the attitude and mentality to want to lead the team forward , i do n't think @entity1 would have done as well as they did either			0
' getting back into the @entity74 was another target i had in mind			0
' he continued : ' personal success is always welcome and makes you happy , because that 's recognition of the good work you have done , ' said @entity0 , who is due to receive the @entity81 for being @entity83 's joint - leading scorer from @entity1 icon @entity84 in @entity15 this week			2
' but i put the team ahead of that and last season @entity1 came so close to winning the @entity7 , which would have been spectacular			2
