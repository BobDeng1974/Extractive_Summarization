by @entity0 @entity2 's decision to play for @entity3 at the 2016 @entity4 has been backed by @entity6 ’s golf coach			1
@entity8 @entity7 believes it would have been ‘ the worst of all worlds ’ if @entity2 had felt unable to choose between @entity6 and @entity10 and had elected to sit on the sidelines when the sport returns to the @entity14 fold			1
