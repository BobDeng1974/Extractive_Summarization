by @entity0 @entity1 had the 5cm brain tumour removed through his nose in an eight - hour operation a grandfather diagnosed with a tumour in his brain had the 5cm growth removed through his nose			1
@entity1 first noticed something was wrong when his eyesight began to fail			1
the 69 - year - old visited his optician within a week of discovering the problem - but was told there was nothing wrong			1
it was only after he was referred to hospital that tests revealed he had a tumour on the pituitary gland in his brain			1
this was pressing on his optic nerves , causing him to slowly lose his sight			1
to his surprise , doctors said they would remove the growth by sucking it out through his nose			1
the grandfather - of - five has now made a full recovery after the operation at @entity31 in @entity32 last september			2
mr @entity1 , who lives with his wife @entity33 in @entity34 , in the @entity35 , said : ' my sight had got so bad that i lost my wife while shopping in @entity39			1
i just could n't see her at the end of the aisle			0
' it came on really suddenly - i was practically blind and could n't read a thing			2
' i had gone from being able to read a car number plate from 25 yards - as you need to for the driving test - to not even being able to see the end of my garden			0
' left untreated for much longer , he would have gone blind , he says			0
' my optician has always been very good but he could n't find anything wrong with my eyes			0
' but an @entity54 at @entity55 revealed he had a pituitary tumour			2
this was pressing on the optic nerves , causing him to slowly lose his sight			1
' looking back , there had probably been other minor symptoms , ' said mr @entity1			2
' but i thought " i 'm bound to get a little tired sometimes because i 'm 69 "			0
' the treatment , which uses an endoscope - a thin , flexible tube with a camera - meant he could return home within a week of the operation			0
the neurosurgeon who carried out the operation , @entity73 , said tumours on the skull base were difficult to remove using conventional procedures			0
he said : ' the operation is extremely invasive and requires a long stay in hospital with breathing and feeding tubes , and leaves visible scarring			0
' it also carries a greater risk of brain damage			0
' however , the endoscopic surgery allows the tumour to be removed via the nostrils without causing disfigurement or damage to the brain			1
' an mri scan at @entity55 revealed mr @entity1 ( with his neurosurgeon @entity73 ) had a pituitary tumour			1
this was pressing on the optic nerves , causing him to slowly lose his sight the tumour is reached by working through one nostril and making a hole in the back of the nasal cavity into the bottom of the skull			1
through this hole , the surgeon can see the bottom of the pituitary gland and the tumour			1
cutting instruments , also mounted on flexible or telescopic arms , are used to remove the growth in pieces - leaving no scarring			2
mr @entity1 said : ' although i initially felt groggy , i recovered quickly			2
by the end of the week i could read anything			0
' i had my operation on the saturday			0
it took eight hours , and i was pretty poorly for a couple of days			0
' but on the tuesday i woke up and looked out of the window , where i could see the clock tower at @entity122 a quarter of a mile away			2
' he is now fundraising to help the hospital 's appeal to raise Â£ 250,000 for three brand new pieces of equipment , which will allow more patients to receive the same treatment he benefited from .			0
