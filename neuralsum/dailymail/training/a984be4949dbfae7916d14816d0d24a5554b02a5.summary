by @entity0 a new @entity2 report says a rise in heroin use in the early 1990s could have been behind a huge spike in thefts and other crimes a fall in the number of drug addicts using heroin and crack cocaine could have led to a 60 per cent drop in crime in the last 20 years , according to a new report			1
@entity2 research claims an ' epidemic ' in class a drug use in the late 1980s and early 1990s - made famous in the book and film trainspotting - was a huge driver in the rise in acquisitive crime			1
but the new report suggests the current generation of young people have turned their backs on the drugs , leading to a large drop in crimes linked to the substances			2
experts have previously disagreed over what has caused the recent fall in levels of thefts and burglaries			2
some academics have suggested higher conviction rates are behind the drop , others say greater security technology could be the cause , while others even suggested reduced amounts of lead in petrol are making people less aggressive			0
the new government paper , written by researcher @entity49 , suggests levels of heroin and crack use are key to understanding the rise and fall			1
he states : ' the number of heroin users increased markedly through the 1980s and early 1990s and many also used crack as their drug - using career developed			1
' this " epidemic " spread from area to area but the national peak probably occurred between 1993 and 2000			2
@entity65 peaked between 1993 and 1995			0
' he added : ' evidence suggests that , for at least some users , heroin / crack was the catalyst for offending , and for others it probably accelerated and extended their criminal career			2
' statistics reveal that 13 police forces saw the number of burglaries peak in 1992/1993 , with a further 19 forces seeing the offence peak the following year			0
after rising by more than 70 per cent between 1989 and 1994 , the offence has generally fallen in the years since			0
the study highlighted @entity82 and @entity83 , where @entity86 's book @entity84 is set , as areas which appeared to show a correlation between the use of hard drugs and the rise in crime			1
trainspotting was made into a film in 1996 and followed a group of heroin addicts in the late 1980s in @entity83 and their life beyond			1
a scene from 1996 film @entity84 , whose heroin - addicted characters had numerous brushes with the law the report continues : ' the starkest example of regional variation was @entity82 , which had a recorded acquisitive crime peak five years before other police force areas			1
' evidence also suggests that @entity82 was one of the first areas to be hit by the heroin epidemic and the first to mount a concerted treatment response			1
' mr @entity49 suggests that tackling the use of the hard drugs could be seen as key to addressing crime problems in the future			0
he wrote : ' evidence also suggests that , for volume - crime reduction , it is crucial to maintain a focus on heroin / crack , despite the higher prevalence of other illicit drugs like cannabis , powder cocaine and ecstasy , and the emergence of new psychoactive substances			0
' specifically , it remains important to identify the minority of heroin / crack users who commit large volumes of crime during addiction periods			0
' if that can be done , and those periods of addiction and offending can be shortened or prevented , the potential for further reductions in crime remains significant			0

heroin epidemic *thought* to have contributed to rise in acquisitive crimes
but since mid- 1990s the offences have dropped by up to 60 per cent
*gradual* decline is said to have been caused by addicts dying or *quitting*
trainspotting is a 1996 film based on a novel by @entity86 which followed a group of heroin addicts in the late 1980s in @entity83
