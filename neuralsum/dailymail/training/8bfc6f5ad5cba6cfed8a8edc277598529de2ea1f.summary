by @entity0 published : 14:47 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 14:47 est , 19 december 2012 caring : @entity1 was a ' loving and absolutely fantastic daughter ' and her father said : ' the day @entity1 died we died ' a teenager died from undiagnosed deep vein thrombosis just hours after visiting an out - of - hours doctor ’s surgery			1
student @entity8 , 16 , limped into the surgery with ' knife - like ' pains after her left thigh became swollen and turned red			1
newly - qualified locum general practitioner dr @entity12 diagnosed an infection and gave her antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs at the @entity17 walk - in centre			1
@entity1 , of @entity18 in @entity19 , was told to see her own gp within 24 or 48 hours and have an ultrasound scan if she was not any better - but she collapsed and died at home about 12 hours later			1
after the @entity23 inquest her parents @entity24 , 59 , and @entity26 , 44 , said they were considering taking legal action against the @entity20 and care @entity17			1
mr @entity28 said of their only child : ' we do n’t think she was given a chance			2
' an expert emergency medical consultant dr @entity33 told the @entity23 hearing if @entity1 had been referred to hospital that day she would likely have shown a high score on tests for @entity38			0
she would have been given an ultrasound scan which would have led to treatment and her chances of survival would have been greatly improved			0
but he could not say @entity1 , who had 11 gcses and was training to be a midwife , would ' more likely than not have survived if she had reached this point in treatment			0
' the @entity20 should also have examined @entity1 ’s calves where swelling is a tell - tale sign of dvt but it was so rare in someone of her age a @entity20 would think it was the least likely option			1
dianette : women taking a contraceptive pill are more likely to develop blood clots delivering a narrative verdict , coroner @entity57 said he had considered whether there was ' culpable human failure ' in @entity1 ’s death or whether it had been ' contributed to by neglect ' but he found the appropriate legal criteria were not met			1
the inquest heard @entity1 had been prescribed the @entity53 pill by her gp which is known to increase the chances of developing blood clots			1
she had been taking the pill for a month after complaining of acne affecting her back , chest and face but came off it because of side effects just a month before she died on december 4 last year			1
the pill was rated as a ' low risk ' factor by experts who gave evidence			1
a post mortem showed @entity1 died from a pulmonary embolism caused by a blood clot moving from her leg through her heart towards her lungs which pathologist dr @entity86 said was ' extremely rare ' in one so young			2
dr @entity12 , who was on - call at the clinic based in @entity89 , said she came in complaining of a pain in the left side of her abdomen radiating to her groin			0
during a ten - minute consultation he noted a large , warm patch of redness on the front of her left thigh			0
because of her brief period on the pill and a lack of negative family history he did not ask any further questions and excluded @entity38 from his diagnosis			2
' i explained it was highly unlikely that it was a clot and my findings were more of an infection or muscular pain , ' he said			2
but @entity1 ’s mother @entity111 , 43 , who accompanied her daughter , told the inquest dr @entity12 failed to notice her daughter ’s swollen left foot and she left ' walking on the back of her pump '			0
the doctor told her : ' it ’s either a blood clot or an infection			2
' @entity1 even texted her cousin four hours after the consultation with the same message and a later text read ' moving a tiny amount kills '			2
just 12 hours later she collapsed on the settee at the family ’s home			1
risks : women are more at risk of a blood clot if they smoke , are overweight or have diabetes @entity53 , which has the medical name cyproterone acetate , works by suppressing the action of testosterone on the body 's @entity138 is also used as a hormone therapy in men undergoing sex change treatment , as well as in tackling early onset puberty			1
the @entity145 website said @entity53 is only used to treat acne when previous treatments have not been successful			1
women are more at risk of a blot clot if they smoke , have polycystic ovary syndrome , are seriously overweight , recently had a baby , have high blood pressure or diabetes or conditions such as @entity157 's disease			0
the @entity145 warns women taking the pill to be wary of signs including migraines for the first time , pain or swelling in legs , stabbing pain when they breathe , pain in the chest or sudden changes to eyesight or hearing			1
gp expert dr @entity172 said the locum ’s assessment was ' reasonable ' but it may have been prudent for him to arrange an ultrasound scan and he did not pick up on @entity1 ’s swollen foot which could have raised suspicions of a blood clot in the lower leg			0
he remained ' unconvinced ' the gp had looked into all the risk factors associated with @entity38			0
mr @entity57 ’ conclusion read : ' @entity8 died in consequence of an undiagnosed dvt			1
' @entity1 had sought medical assistance at lunchtime the previous day and whilst there are unresolved conflicts of evidence about that consultation it can not be said , even at its highest , that the examination and assessment amounted to gross failure			0
' furthermore , even if diagnosed at that time it can not be said that a referral to hospital would more likely than not have saved @entity1 ’s life			0
' after the hearing mrs @entity8 said : ' we took the @entity20 at his word			1
things could definitely have been done more differently and @entity1 might have stood a chance			0
' we have n’t a clue how she got @entity38			0
i kept asking her if she had suffered a fall or a bump but she said not			0
it is a complete mystery			0
' mr @entity28 said : ' she was perfectly fine three days earlier			0
it just came on so quickly			0
since her death it has been a total living nightmare			2
the day @entity1 died we died			2

@entity8 *stopped* taking the @entity53 pill four weeks before her death
@entity20 thought it was an infection and gave her antibiotics but she died 12 hours later
*devastated* parents say they are considering legal action
