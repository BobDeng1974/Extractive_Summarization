by @entity0 @entity2 's joint takeover of @entity3 along with @entity4 has been left in serious doubt due to funding issues			1
the duo had announced a deal to take control at the club last month following the exchange of contracts and a press conference held in @entity14 last month , and they had hoped to secure the finances required through a crowd funding initiative			1
but the pair have announced they have failed in their scheme , after releasing a joint statement			0
rain on the parade : @entity2 's joint takeover of @entity3 is in serious doubt fan : @entity2 is a lifelong supporter of @entity3 and even appeared for their reserves last season the @entity28 set up a funding scheme with the aim of raising £ 2million but the deadline for pledges passed on thursday with the total more than £ 1million short of the target , which means @entity4 will now not pass the @entity36 's ' fit and proper person 's test '			1
' the @entity39 project has failed to reach the target as set out under the terms of the funding arrangements , ' they said			0
' the result of this will be that all pledges will be cancelled and funds returned to the relevant parties			0
' as a result of the funding not being available from @entity39 for the @entity3 project , @entity4 is unable to meet the requirements of the @entity51 and @entity53 test			2
' the consequence of this is that the deal to takeover the club is now in serious doubt			2
' the @entity28 had previously stated the takeover of the club would go ahead irrespective of the success or failure of its crowdfunding project			0
it is understood @entity4 , who last november stepped down as @entity3 chairman thus ending a 15 - year association with @entity3 , met with @entity36 representatives this week in a bid to reassure them he and @entity2 had the finances to run the @entity73 club			1
however , @entity36 issued the following statement in response to comments @entity4 regarding the proposed takeover of @entity3			1
a spokesman said : ' in any club takeover it is a requirement for the prospective purchaser to provide a business plan and to demonstrate that the funding is in place to deliver on that plan			1
' this is part of the @entity36 's ongoing efforts to ensure the financial sustainability of our clubs			2
' in this case , this fundamental requirement has not yet been met			0
we are in close contact with the @entity95 and will continue our dialogue			0
' pop : @entity2 's ( second left ) image rights caused the takeover to be stalled on two occasions return : @entity4 was also part of the joint takeover bid the takeover had been set for completion on friday and will come as a huge blow to the @entity107 singer who is a lifelong @entity3 supporter			1
@entity2 played for their reserve side against @entity110 earlier this year and had been close to a takeover before , but a move was twice delayed because of negotiations over image rights			1
they had been resolved and @entity4 , the lesser known of the two men , would have been the more hands - on			2
the businessman has extensive football experience and oversaw @entity3 's rise from non-league to the championship as well as their move from @entity124 to the @entity125 before stepping aside in november to allow @entity126 and @entity127 to take over			0
the initial snag had related to @entity2 's image rights , which are owned by his management team and would entitle them to a share of any money generated from the use of his image or name			0
they believe that interest in the club will increase as a result of @entity2 's ownership and it is understood they battled for a share of any extra revenue made through merchandise and extra ticket sales			0
@entity2 signed on as a player at the start of last season in a move to make money for the @entity154 charity and turned out in front of nearly 10,000 fans for the reserve team in february			0
by a strange quirk , @entity4 has also played for @entity3 , with the then 52 - year - old having brought himself on as a substitute in a 4 - 2 win against @entity161 which came after his club had sealed promotion from the @entity164 in 2003 .			1
