@entity0 has stepped up his training as he prepares to return to the ring			2
the former heavyweight world champion confirmed last weekend that he would fight this autumn , more than two years after he stopped @entity4 at @entity5			1
and the 33 - year - old has also posted video clips of his training regime on @entity9			0
video : @entity0 trains in the gym ahead of comeback @entity0 can be seen performing pull - ups , dips and punching the speed bag in his @entity17 gym			2
on saturday he told @entity18 : ' i 'll have nights in the future to talk about			0
if i was a betting man , i 'd bet that i 'll fight in september or october			2
' the @entity22 was at @entity23 on saturday night to see his friend @entity24 knock out his former training partner @entity25 in front of 80,000 fans			1
@entity0 twice pulled out of a clash with fellow @entity30 heavyweight @entity29 last year , first with a cut suffered in sparring and then after rupturing tendons in his shoulder			2
a five - hour operation last november looked set to bring down the curtain on his illustrious career but @entity0 has gradually stepped up his training			0
old friends : @entity0 ( right ) speaks to @entity24 after his victory over @entity25 at @entity23 and last week , his trainer and manager @entity41 confirmed a comeback was imminent			1
speaking to the @entity44 , he said : ' it 's true , 100 per cent true , @entity0 is coming back			0
' we will not be making any big announcement but @entity0 has been given the all clear by his medical people and he wants to fight again			0
' we plan to get back in the ring before the end of the year and preferably by october			0
' @entity0 has started training and there is no need to keep this a secret any longer			0
he has been trying to recuperate for five and a half months and only now has he been given the all clear to fight again			0
' @entity0 will have one eye on the second of this year 's @entity30 grudge rematches when @entity29 takes on @entity4 at the @entity59 in july			1
last time out : @entity0 has not fought since he knocked out @entity4 at @entity5 two years ago down and out : @entity0 stopped @entity4 in the fifth round of their grudge match at @entity64 's ground the pair first met in 2011 with @entity29 winning a unanimous decision over an overweight and unfit @entity4 at @entity67			1
the winner in @entity59 will be installed as the mandatory challenger to world champion @entity70 and it is unlikely that either man would risk that position for a fight with @entity0			1
another option for the former unified cruiserweight world champion is @entity77 who won the vacant @entity79 title after @entity81 's decision to retire			1
@entity77 beat @entity82 last month but has his own mandatory due against knockout sensation @entity83 , a former sparring partner of @entity0			2

@entity0 will return to the ring in september or october
the former heavyweight world champion has not fought since july 2012
he could target winner of @entity4 vs @entity29 in july
@entity79 champion @entity77 is another option for @entity0
