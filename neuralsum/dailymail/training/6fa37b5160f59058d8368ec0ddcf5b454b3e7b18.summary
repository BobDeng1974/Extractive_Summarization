judge @entity50 said : ' you are here because of what happened with a 13 - year - old girl			1
' you made it clear that at a later stage you wished to have a sexual relationship , and you took advantage of her when you were in a car together			0
' this was the culmination of a long campaign			0
to characterise it as just a kiss in a car does not begin to cover what really happened			0
' this is every parent 's nightmare because you managed to use a degree of personal charm to obtain the trust of her family			1
' long campaign ' : a judge at @entity49 ( pictured ) said it was ' every parent 's nightmare ' ' when you were arrested you were found to have a small number of indecent images			1
this comes as no surprise , because no matter how much you claim this was personal to her , the fact remains you have a sexual interest in children			0
' the images themselves are serious			0
they are video footage showing real situations ; and the worst of them shows a girl of three being raped			2

' it is not a world he created to come into contact with young people			0
she stumbled into his world by accident			0
' the messages are completely unrealistic romantic fantasies			0
this man , after all that , built himself up to kissing a 13 - year - old girl on the lips once ; and when he was rebuffed , it fizzled and died			1
