patients given the metal bells at @entity9 in @entity10 include a frail dementia patient @entity19 , 84 , who was too weak to pick it up			1
she had been rushed to hospital after a fall and later died he criticised the ' antiquated ' system as being ' like something out of @entity5 '			2
' we were given a bell as an emergency call service , ' he said			0
' they said " sorry , just ring the bell if you need any help because there is no call system in this room "			2
' this is from a hospital that cost £ 430million to build			0
' in a state - of - the - art hospital that they use a little brass bell is incredible			0
it sounds like something out of @entity5			0
' it 's ridiculous really			0
the hospital is a beautiful building - you would think you are going into a shopping centre or a hotel , and they spent a quarter of a million on a clock			0
' my mum could n't even pick up a glass of water , let alone a bell			0
' state - of - the - art @entity9 opened last may and high tech alert systems were installed at 800 bedsides - but not in ' clinical rooms ' used in busy periods			1
hospital bosses said doorbells were tested , but the 23 hand bells - costing a total of £ 91.77 - were deemed to be the most audible and handed out in october			2
the state - of - the - art unit at the £ 430m flagship @entity9 in @entity10 opened in may			1
but 23 clinical rooms - used when there is a lack of other beds - are still without a proper electronic patient alert system a spokesperson said they were a ' short term ' solution , and would be replaced with the proper alert system in a month			1
but mr @entity84 , a signmaker , said the situation should have been remedied since his mother was admitted in december			0
she fell at home while cooking her dinner and after an hour and a half in a ' freezing ' corridor she was taken for an x-ray and given a cubicle in @entity94			0
but the next morning the pensioner was moved into a small procedure room - which he described as ' more like a storage room ' - where she was handed a bell			0
she had surgery on her hip , and was taken to a proper ward , but passed away earlier this month			2
' there were piles of medical boxes on the side and staff kept apologising and coming in to get things from the cupboards , ' he said			0
the 23 metal hand bells were purchased by the trust in late october as an ' interim measure ' ' that was quite some time ago			1
it needs something doing now			0
' @entity118 mp @entity117 also criticised the bells			2
she said : ' while it 's good they are making alternative arrangements , it 's yet another example of glitches in the system			0
' @entity125 , director of nursing and quality and @entity127 said : ' to help our winter capacity , improve patient flow through the hospital and reduce the amount of time patients are waiting in @entity94 , we use procedure rooms on a short - term basis until a regular room becomes available			1
' these 23 clinical rooms on the wards are entirely appropriate for safe and dignified patient care and are more suitable and comfortable for patients than waiting in @entity94			1
' in this environment we are able to deliver the best care to our patients			0
' these rooms are not currently connected to the electronic call bell system which has been in place for the other 800 patient beds since the new hospital opened in may			1
' in order to ensure that patients can call nurses 23 metal hand bells were purchased by the trust in late october as an interim measure			1
' prior to buying these bells other solutions were tested in the ward areas and the hand bell was found to be most appropriate as it could be heard throughout the ward			2
' we anticipate that the electronic call bell system will be extended to these rooms in a month			1
' i met with mrs @entity19 and her son back in december to discuss their concerns and offered my apologies			0

patients at @entity9 , @entity10 , were given the metal bells
23 clinical rooms are still without a proper electronic patient alert system
the handbells were bought as ' interim measure ' as they are clearly heard
but families argue that many frail , elderly patients are too weak to lift them
