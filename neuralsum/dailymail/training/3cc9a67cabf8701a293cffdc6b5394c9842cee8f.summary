six ambulances took 13 men to hospital with what they claimed were serious injuries after they had ‘ crashed ’ on their way to a stag party			1
but the ‘ accident ’ was a brazen scam designed to fool the authorities and get £ 134,000 from a false insurance claim for whiplash injuries			2
the men faked their injuries and made a ‘ dramatic recovery ’ after arriving in hospital			1
some had been put in neck braces for the journey to @entity31 where they were given ‘ unnecessary ’ neck and spine x-rays , a court heard			0
police were suspicious as the group had no overnight bags or clothes for the weekend away in @entity38 – more than two hours ’ drive from the crash scene in @entity41			1
and when paramedics initially approached the minibus , driver @entity42 , 45 , and his passengers seemed to be ‘ quite well ’			2
@entity46 , prosecuting , said : ‘ the defendants were laughing , smoking and chatting on mobile phones			0
what followed was a domino effect as they began to hold their necks and say they had suffered injury			0
’ despite being responsible for tying up @entity57 resources in a busy casualty unit , the gang walked free from @entity5 on friday with suspended jail sentences			1
judge @entity60 told them : ‘ if there had been a serious accident in this area on that night in which people were genuinely hurt or dying , the emergency services would have been unable to help them because they would be dealing with you			0
’ during a break in their sentencing hearing some of the gang went outside the court			2
one of them , @entity2 , 25 , pulled out a wad of notes and showed them off , knowing that he was being photographed			1
the ‘ accident ’ happened in august 2009			0
the ‘ crash for cash ’ gang were n’t arrested until december 2011 after @entity80 had compiled a dossier of evidence			1
cash : @entity2 's gang would have taken £ 134,000 between them from @entity80 if they had pulled off the scheme investigators working for the insurer discovered the minibus had been damaged elsewhere – probably by being driven into a post – and debris spread at the ‘ crash ’ scene on a slip road of the @entity96 near the @entity97			1
the minibus was supposed to have collided with a @entity100 car , but the car had never been at the crash scene			1
@entity102 , the @entity100 ’s owner , was a friend of the stag - do ‘ groom ’ , @entity103 , 28 , and came forward claiming to have been driving it			0
his ‘ passenger ’ , girlfriend @entity107 , 21 , also made a fake whiplash claim			0
community order : miss @entity107 had been under the pressure of her boyfriend , the court heard the court heard the gang had lied to paramedics , doctors and insurers in an attempt to ‘ line their own pockets ’ , but @entity80 did not pay out any money			2
mr @entity46 said insurance investigators discovered @entity102 was no stranger to the minibus group as he claimed but friends on @entity124 with many of them			1
@entity103 and @entity42 were given 12 month suspended jail terms and a £ 360 fine , and ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid work			0
