by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson the @entity1 ready to be crowned @entity2 is how @entity4 ’s appearance in wednesday night ’s @entity6 final has been billed			1
he is yet to score in the cup in four brief appearances but his 19 goals in all other competitions have left @entity12 fans convinced he will step up in the absence of @entity14			1
so far this season he has delivered without @entity14 – half of his 14 league goals have been scored when his @entity19 team - mate has not been in the side – but games in @entity22 do n’t come much bigger than @entity24 cup finals and @entity25 on wednesday morning referred to this match as ‘ the game of his life ’			1
settled in : @entity4 has lived up to the hype since his world record transfer from @entity43 his worst moment of form and fitness came at the end of last year and he benefited from the @entity12 obsession with @entity14 winning the @entity49			1
his blip would have made far more headlines had @entity14 not been on the brink of being crowned @entity53			2
@entity4 is the first galactico spared the intense first season spotlight because it has remained on @entity56 , but on wednesday night the lights will all be on him as @entity12 try to win the @entity59 for the first time since 2011			1
then , it was @entity14 who got the only goal in an extra-time 1 - 0 win			0
@entity4 has impressed his team - mates this season with some super-human goals			2
the run from the half - way line against @entity70 and the perfectly executed first time shot that he squeezed into the corner from 30 yards out against @entity73			0
but team - mates have also remarked on how detached he remains in the dressing room			0
it ’s a coldness born of not speaking the language ; of still adapting to the club that is like no other in the world ; but also of a steely determination to succeed			0
@entity4 has kept the blinkers on and his team - mates believe that will serve him well as the season heads into the home straight			2
line up : @entity12 defender @entity87 posted this picture of @entity89 , himself , chairman @entity90 , @entity14 and @entity91 sidelined : @entity53 @entity14 will miss the clash with a left hamstring problem when others have been affected by the ever - changing moods of the @entity35 , @entity4 has remained completely untouched by both the abuse and the adulation			1
he has gained the reputation of a man moved only by his own numbers – 15 assists and 19 goals is an incredible first season return			1
he needs to get his first goal against @entity105 and more importantly , bag his first trophy			0
big final : @entity4 will be looking to win his first trophy with @entity12 as they face @entity105 in the @entity6 @entity105 boss @entity110 believes be criticised even if his side beat @entity12 on wednesday night			1
' when i arrived in @entity105 , people were saying i would n’t be eating @entity115 pudding here , ' said the @entity117			0
' but now i ’m getting ready to eat a nice @entity118			0
' whatever happens , the analysis of my performance will not be positive			0
that ’s the price you pay for being here			0
' deadly duo : @entity105 pair @entity125 ( centre ) and @entity127 prepare for wednesday night 's showdown			2

@entity4 will lead @entity12 's *attack* in @entity6 final against @entity105

@entity138 has scored 19 goals in his first season at the @entity35
