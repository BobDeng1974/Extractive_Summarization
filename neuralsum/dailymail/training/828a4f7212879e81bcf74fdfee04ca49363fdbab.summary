@entity1 's tenure as president of @entity3 would appear to be drawing to a close , despite his statements to the contrary during the course of the @entity9 @entity8			1
rumours swirled ahead of the race at @entity12 that after 23 years at the helm , @entity1 was on his way out			1
but on saturday , standing on the steps of the @entity3 motorhome , the 67 - year - old made clear he would be seeing out a three - year contract he signed in march			1
defiant : @entity1 made it clear at @entity12 he wanted to see out his three - year contract with @entity3 results : despite a strong driving line - up , @entity3 under @entity1 have failed in recent years to win such comments , however , have earned a rebuke from @entity25 , the head of @entity3 's parent company , @entity27 / @entity26			1
@entity25 's comments followed a miserable home race for @entity3 as @entity30 retired whilst @entity31 was only ninth			2
whilst @entity1 has revitalised @entity3 as a car company , with the prestige manufacturer poised to announce record results soon , on track in @entity36 the @entity38 marque has floundered			2
if @entity1 is to leave , then @entity25 has suggested it will be on the basis @entity3 are without a title in @entity36 for six years			2
criticism : @entity27 and @entity26 ceo @entity25 has claimed that @entity1 is not bulletproof tough times : @entity30 ( above ) retired whilst @entity31 was only ninth at @entity12 not present at the grand prix , but speaking to reporters post-race at an event 25 miles from @entity12 , @entity25 said : ' the heart of @entity3 is winning in @entity36			2
' i do n't want to see our drivers in seventh and 12th place			0
to see the @entity51 in this state , with the best drivers , exceptional facilities , engineers who are really good , to see all that and then to consider we have not won since 2008 ... ' the important thing for @entity3 is not just the financial results , but also it is winning , and we have been struggling for six years			1
' @entity25 has also confirmed that whilst @entity1 may have put pen to paper on a new deal six months ago , he is not bulletproof			0
last time : @entity31 lifted the @entity62 in 2007 , the last time @entity3 won the title ' on volume and economic results , @entity1 has done an outstanding job , ' added @entity25			1
' we are good friends , but when i read his statements these are things i would not have said myself			0
' i consider myself essential , of course , but i also know very well i am at the service of this company			0
' so to create positions , illusions that one can operate outside the rules , is talking rubbish			0
' it 's the same for him as it is for me - we serve the company			0
' when the company has a change of plan , or if there is no longer a convergence of ideas , things change			0
