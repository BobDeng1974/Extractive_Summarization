@entity0 2015 has dawned glittering with the prospect of more brilliant fights than for many a @entity3			0
a seismic shift in boxing politics , one stretching from this side of the @entity7 to the other , has raised real hope that @entity9 versus @entity10 will be but one of several long - awaited fights which will make their way through the ropes in the coming 12 months			1
pressure from not only the public but some of the most respected figures in the game is compelling the rival tycoons of the ring to do business with each other for the benefit of the fans , the fighters and boxing itself			2
@entity9 ( left ) may finally face @entity10 in the ring in 2015 @entity9 ( left ) eyes up @entity29 during his fight with the @entity31 in @entity32 last september @entity10 ( right ) trades blows with @entity34 during the pair 's bout in @entity32 last april our own @entity37 , still the last undisputed heavyweight champion of the world , speaks for us all when he says : ' let 's stop all the nonsense and make this fight happen			1
' he was referring to the @entity9 - @entity10 saga in particular but that sentiment applies to any number of important bouts which have been blocked by the self - interest of rival promoters and television moguls often to the detriment of the game			1
at last , the barriers are coming down			0
the @entity53 himself , @entity55 , has led the way by reaching out to make the peace with his company 's fiercest rival , @entity60			1
@entity55 ( left ) has made peace with his company 's fiercest rival @entity60 ( right ) fights between members of these opposing stables began taking place before @entity67			1
for breaking down this barrier , as well as beating his addictions to drink and drugs , @entity55 was named ' promoter of 2014 ' by @entity72			2
now @entity55 and @entity60 's @entity73 are deep in talks for @entity75 and @entity76 to meet in a spring mega-fight			1
more immediately , @entity55 is co-promoting the first fight of major import in 2014 with old foe @entity80			2
former heavyweight champion of the world @entity37 has called for a @entity9 - @entity10 bout here is a mouth - watering list of just some of the spectaculars we can expect to see in 2015 scheduled already january 17 - @entity93 v @entity91 , @entity95 world heavyweight title ( @entity32 ) january 31 - @entity96 and @entity97 in world title eliminators ( 02 @entity99 ) february 21 - @entity102 v @entity100 , @entity104 world super-middleweight title rematch ( @entity105 ) ; @entity108 v @entity106 , @entity104 world middleweight title ( @entity110 ) february 28 - @entity113 v @entity111 , @entity115 world super-bantamweight title ( @entity116 ) ; @entity117 and @entity118 jnr in world title eliminators ( 02 @entity99 ) march 6 – @entity122 v @entity120 , @entity115 world super-featherweight title ( @entity124 ) april 4 – @entity127 v @entity125 or @entity91 ( @entity128 , @entity129 ) in the offing : world title fights @entity9 v @entity10			1
then the winner v @entity134 @entity135 v @entity134 @entity137 v @entity138 @entity76 v @entity75 @entity142 v @entity140 @entity145 v @entity143 @entity127 v @entity91 , then @entity117 @entity113 v @entity147 , @entity149 @entity152 v @entity150 @entity108 v @entity154 others @entity96 v @entity156 or @entity158 @entity161 v @entity159 ( rematch ) @entity91 , @entity55 's great hope to end @entity165 's world heavyweight champion drought , challenges @entity80 's man @entity93 for the @entity95 title in @entity32 in a fortnight			1
as the facilitating promoter for @entity9 's company in his recent fights , @entity55 is also doing what he can to finally bring the @entity172 and the @entity10 together for the richest fight in ring history			1
although he would have a stronger financial stake in @entity134 fighting @entity9 – which he proclaims as the best alternative , @entity55 says : ' as a boxing fan first and foremost i understand completely that @entity9 versus @entity10 is the fight all of us most want to see			1
it has to happen soon , for the good of boxing			0
' the major obstacle , @entity9 's prevarications notwithstanding , is the stand - off between the two major @entity165 cable television networks			2
@entity9 is contracted to @entity188 ; @entity10 to @entity189			2
@entity37 challenges them to collaborate : ' both of them put my fight with @entity194 on pay - per - view and shared more than two million buys between them			2
i see no reason why they should n't do the same for a fight as huge as @entity9 v @entity10 which would attract an even bigger audience			1
' nor does anyone else outside those board - rooms			0
meanwhile , a variation on the tv theme has exposed as a myth what appeared to be another of the monopolies which has handicapped @entity212 boxing down the decades			0
@entity134 's scintillating performances in @entity32 against @entity165 @entity214 and @entity215 were of importance beyond their impact on the @entity218			0
the first was screened in this country on @entity220 by @entity221 , who in the process of expanding his tv business is putting the quality of broadcast fights above the vested interest of his own promotions			0
when @entity229 negotiated for the second to be on @entity231 , they excluded the promoter who was widely believed to hold the exclusive rights to put on all that station 's boxing broadcasts			0
by proceeding without @entity236 , @entity231 opened the door to a world of alternative possibilities			0
although @entity236 put on a magnificent production by filling @entity241 with 80,000 fans for @entity142 's rematch with @entity159 and spreading the boxing gospel to a far wider cross-over audience which includes a younger generation , this has to be healthier			0
@entity134 ( right ) could potentially face the winner of the proposed @entity9 and @entity10 bout for example , equal co-operation between @entity236 's @entity252 company and @entity255 's @entity254 operation in @entity116 would increase the chances of @entity147 and @entity113 meeting in a much - wanted @entity259 for the unified world super-bantamweight championship			1
perhaps it could happen after one of them has put down the threat from @entity165 's rival belt - holder @entity149			0
@entity231 's willingness to work with @entity267 should simplify the making of a deal with @entity236 for a fall - back fight with @entity135 at @entity241 , should @entity134 fail to pin down @entity9 and / or @entity10			1
open competition is the essence of sport and that needs to apply not only to boxers but to their paymasters			0
as @entity37 says : ' boxing politricks must not prevent the fights the world wants to see			0
' @entity236 oversaw the thrilling spectacle of @entity142 ( left ) versus @entity159 at @entity241			0

@entity37 calls for end to @entity9 vs @entity10 saga
@entity55 has made peace with rival promoter @entity60
now @entity55 and @entity60 are deep in talks for @entity75 and @entity76 to meet in a spring mega-fight
@entity55 is hoping to bring @entity9 and @entity10 into the ring
the potential bout could be the richest fight in ring history
