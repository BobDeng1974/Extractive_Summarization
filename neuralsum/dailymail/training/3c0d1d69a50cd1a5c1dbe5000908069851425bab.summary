@entity1 prisoners have overtaken other nationalities to top the league table of foreign inmates jailed in @entity5 , shocking figures from the @entity7 reveal			1
the statistics , which cover the period when restrictions were lifted on @entity1 and @entity12 migrants in early 2014 , will reignite the debate on ‘ open - door ’ @entity15 immigration as the election approaches			1
overall , one prisoner in eight in @entity20 and @entity21 jails is a foreign national , the figures show			1
crackdown : a @entity23 beggar , who is not accused of theft , is arrested in @entity25 , @entity26			0
@entity1 prisoners have overtaken other nationalities to top the league table of foreign inmates jailed in @entity5 that proportion has doubled in the past ten years , corresponding with the mass influx of immigration from @entity31			1
but a more detailed breakdown by nationality of all inmates shows that @entity1 , @entity35 and @entity36 are all proportionately far more likely to be imprisoned than @entity5			1
the figures reveal that the @entity1 ’ speciality is shoplifting in organised gangs , leading to suspicions that the much - vaunted @entity15 principle of freedom of movement is being abused by criminals			1
@entity45 mp @entity44 , who obtained the figures , called them ‘ staggering and unacceptable ’			0
the tables , which cover prisoners jailed between october 2013 and march 2014 , represent the most comprehensive breakdown of inmates ’ countries of origin			1
crime by crime : who are the biggest culprits ? foreign prisoners in @entity5 jails ranked by offence they also reveal marked differences in the likelihood of different nationalities to be jailed , when adjusted for the number of those nationals living in @entity5			1
whereas @entity67 , which has the largest population of 617,000 in the @entity5 , ranks high in the table , with 573 prisoners imprisoned , it comes second to @entity1 , which saw 760 of its 126,000 population incarcerated			1
it means @entity1 are more than six times as likely as @entity67 to end up in jail , and eight times as likely as @entity5			1
the bulk of those jailed – 34,168 out of 39,773 – are @entity5 and only a tiny minority of foreign nationals fall foul of the law			1
overall , the most likely foreigners to be imprisoned were @entity83 and @entity35 – with more than one per cent of their respective populations in @entity5 ( 10,000 and 11,000 ) jailed in that time			1
pictured above : how we highlighted the pickpocketing issue in the @entity5 , and a police warning sign a previous @entity90 study , showing the top ten nationalities of foreign prisoners in 2013 - 14 , placed @entity1 fourth behind @entity67 , @entity93 and @entity94			1
the growing numbers of @entity1 criminals entering the @entity5 justice system is underlined by separate data obtained from police forces , showing about 11,000 @entity1 are arrested each year			1
that works out at about two per cent of total arrests – the vast majority of them for shoplifting – even though @entity1 only make up 0.2 per cent of the general population			2
our figures , obtained under the @entity107 , showed that in every force area , @entity1 committed more shoplifting offences than any other crime			1
mr @entity44 , mp for @entity112 , @entity113 , said : ‘ this lays bare that free movement of people in the @entity15 also means free movement of criminals within the @entity15			2
‘ we are unnecessarily opening our borders to lots of people to commit crimes , who create unnecessary victims of crime in the @entity5			2
that is one of the reasons why we would be better off out of the @entity15 – so we could control immigration and stop some of these criminals before they get into the country			1
nation by nation : eastern @entity134 take top three slots for most people jailed here who are from abroad ‘ it is absolutely staggering			2
it has created unnecessary victims of crime , is costing us a fortune in police time and prison places			0
’ lord @entity144 , @entity145 chairman , said : ‘ these statistics strengthen the case for tightening the arrangements within the @entity15 for the removal of convicted criminals to their countries of origin , as the government have proposed			2
’ the @entity7 figures also provide an insight into the types of crimes favoured by different foreign criminals			2
while @entity67 tops the league for violence , with 156 jailed for these offences , 18 @entity1 were imprisoned for sexual offences , ahead of @entity163 and @entity67			1
robbery offences saw @entity93 prisoners take the top spot , with 15 custodial sentences , and @entity1 and @entity168 came a close second with 14 each			2
@entity1 feature in the top five for most offence categories – in crimes involving burglary , theft and handling , and fraud and forgery , they are out in front			2
second in the fraud and forgery stakes were @entity181 prisoners , who came seventh in the table of all crimes committed			0
for drugs crimes , the @entity83 were ahead with 118 of their prisoners jailed for , predominantly , being in charge of cannabis farms			0
@entity187 ( pictured ) was duped by a prolific gang of eight @entity1 burglars and shoplifters highly organised gangs of @entity1 have targeted @entity5 stores on an almost industrial scale in recent years			1
one of those to have fallen victim to such groups was newsagent @entity197 , from @entity199 , @entity200 , who was duped by a particularly prolific gang of eight @entity1 burglars and shoplifters			2
mrs @entity197 was in charge of the shop when a large group of mostly women asked for her help			0
as she went around the newsagent helping them to find items , other members of the gang sneaked into the upstairs flat where they raided her daughter ’s bedroom			0
they stole jewellery that her daughter had been given from friends and family for her 18th and 21st birthdays			0
mrs @entity197 said : ‘ i was helping them and they distracted my attention			0
i thought they were a bit unruly ; i was a bit worried but i could see they had money in their hands			0
’ she revealed that one of the tactics the gang used was to bombard her with several different requests at once			0
‘ i was trying to please them all , ’ she said			0
‘ i was serving them and i suddenly turned around and saw somebody coming out of the private door to our home			0
they robbed me and then they were gone			0
’ mrs @entity197 , who has owned the newsagent with her husband for 28 years , added : ‘ afterwards , i was really frightened of foreigners coming into the shop			0
i get really sweaty and worried that it will be the same people coming in			0
‘ i think some of the @entity1 are interested in coming to this country just to rob people			0
’ the gang were jailed for more than 24 years after a nationwide crime spree netted them £ 170,000 of goods and cash .			0
