@entity1 officials announced thursday that three women have become the first to ever graduate from its tough - as - nails infantry course - but it could be two years before they ’re allowed to serve in an infantry unit			1
the three completed the 59 - day course at @entity11 ’s @entity10 and met the same grueling test standards as the men , but even as more jobs are opened to women across all military branches @entity16 leaders say they need more time to study whether females are fit to serve as grunts			1
now pvt. 1st @entity20 , pvt. 1st @entity22 , and @entity23 will go on to serve vital roles , but their historic accomplishment will remain largely symbolic			1
selfless selfies : the world was introduced to the women who would become the first to ever finish the @entity1 ' grueling course on @entity10 in this @entity31 photo taken by @entity32 ( center )			1
@entity34 was actually sidelined with an injury before she could finish the 59 - day course historic : @entity39 ( left ) and @entity40 ( right ) are two of the three women who the @entity1 said thursday have become the first to ever successfully complete the tough - as - nails , 59 - day infantry training course @entity43 : private first class @entity23 , 19 , of @entity45 , @entity46 also completed the grueling course , the @entity1 said thursday this despite having successfully endured a 12 - mile march with an 80 - pound pack and a variety of combat fitness tests such as timed combat shuttle runs , timed ammunition container lifts and tests that simulate running under combat fire			1
‘ any force - wide changes to be made will occur only after we have conducted our research , determined the way ahead and set the conditions to implement our recommendations , ’ @entity1 spokeswoman captain @entity57 told the @entity58			1
the step comes as the @entity1 continues to evaluate where women might serve in combat			1
earlier this year , the @entity70 lifted the ban on women serving in combat jobs , but each of the service branches is developing how this might be accomplished			0
the @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity1 are looking at the standards required for serving in battlefront jobs such as infantry , armor and elite commando positions			1
they have until jan. 1 , 2016 , to open as many jobs as possible to women , and to explain why if they decide to keep some closed			0
the common requirements for men and women for each job would be based on specific tasks			0
military officials have said the standards will not be lowered in order to bring women into any combat posts			2
@entity98 , 25 , of @entity99 , @entity100 admitted she found the process difficult			0
‘ our instructor , he told us all it takes is everything you got , and it ’s true , ’ she told the @entity103			0
‘ once you are committed to a goal , you can make it if you put everything into it			0
’ symbolic only : despite their historic accomplishment , the women will not be joining an infantry unit because the @entity1 has yet to okay that job for females 18 - year - old @entity40 of @entity119 , @entity118 does n’t think what she ’s done is much to write home about			1
‘ i do n’t really feel anything special just because , [ the male graduates ] did the same thing that we did , and a lot of them did it better than us , ’ she said			0
‘ i do n’t feel any different from them , i do n’t think			0
’ @entity23 , 19 , of @entity45 , @entity46 declined an interview with the @entity103			1
another woman , @entity34 will likely become the fourth female graduate once she recovers from a leg injury and if she can pass the final @entity133 and @entity134			1
on its website , the @entity1 said the @entity10 course is the follow - on training for @entity16 who graduate from basic training at @entity141 , @entity142 , and about 20,000 @entity16 train there every year			1
@entity16 who complete recruit training at the post near @entity145 move on to the infantry school at @entity148 in @entity149			2
rare honor : @entity98 smiles at a male recruit			0
she was one of 15 women who showed up on day one			2
only three completed @entity10 's grueling 59 - day course uphill battle : earlier this year , the @entity70 lifted the ban on women serving in combat jobs but even as the three women made history the @entity1 said the ban remains on women in infantry units @entity141 is the only site where female @entity1 go through basic training			1
@entity165 said 15 women began the enlisted course with 254 men in september			1
it was n't immediately clear exactly how many male @entity1 completed the course to graduation on thursday			2
she said the course is separate from one that trains @entity1 infantry officers for leadership positions at @entity176 , @entity177			2
several women lieutenants have attempted to complete that course , but so far none has passed			2
a new group of enlisted @entity16 enters the infantry course every two weeks , and each of the units currently in training has women in them , @entity165 said			2
under a 1994 @entity70 policy , women were prohibited from being assigned to ground combat units below the brigade level			0
a brigade is roughly 3,500 troops split into several battalions of about 800 soldiers each			0
historically , brigades were based farther from the front lines , and they often included top command and support staff			0
last year the military opened up about 14,500 combat positions to women , most of them in the @entity77 , by allowing them to serve in many jobs at the battalion level			0
the january order lifted the last barrier to women serving in combat , but allows the services to argue to keep some jobs closed			0
the bulk of the nearly 240,000 jobs currently closed to women are in the @entity77 , including those in infantry , armor , combat engineer and artillery units that are often close to the battlefront			0
similar jobs in the @entity1 are also closed			0
proud : privates @entity39 , left , 25 , and @entity40 , right , 18 , share a moment with @entity223 , president of the @entity224 , @entity11 - 1 , @entity225 , @entity226 following graduation ceremony held on @entity10 thursday			1

@entity229 , 18 ; @entity39 , 25 ; and @entity23 , 19 are the only women to ever successfully complete boot camp at @entity11 's @entity10
despite their historic accomplishment , they will not actually be allowed to serve in an infantry unit for as long as two years as @entity1 officials study the *implications* of female ' grunts '
there were 15 female recruits when the women began , but only the three have completed the 59 - day course
a fourth woman , @entity32 will likely become the fourth ever female to complete the course once she recovers from an injured leg and if she can pass the final @entity133 and @entity134
