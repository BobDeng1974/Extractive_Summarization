by @entity0 published : 19:33 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 06:07 est , 25 april 2013 at least a million children and teenagers are to be vaccinated against measles in an attempt to stop expected outbreaks in @entity6			1
some will never have had a jab , while others have only had the first of two doses of the measles , mumps and rubella ( @entity15 ) vaccine			2
the £ 20million campaign follows a big rise in cases in @entity19 , where public health officials have been running clinics to increase protection rates			1
many of those affected are teenagers who missed out on vaccination in the late 1990s and early 2000s when parents were concerned about a link between @entity15 and autism that has since been discredited			1
vaccinations : figures show there were 587 confirmed measles cases in @entity6 in the first three months of this year , more than three times the 168 cases in the same period of 2012 figures from @entity6 ( @entity6 ) show there were 587 confirmed measles cases in @entity6 in the first three months of this year , more than three times the 168 cases in the same period of 2012			1
the highest number of cases is among ten to 16 - year - olds			2
experts predict @entity6 ’s total this year will exceed the 1,920 cases confirmed in 2012 unless action is taken			1
professor @entity45 , director of immunisation at the @entity47 , said : ‘ the situation in @entity49 , i believe , is a wake - up call for parents – for parents who for whatever reason , quite a few years ago , chose not to vaccinate their children and for whom these days vaccines are n’t really things that they think about very much			0
’ he added : ‘ you have to prevent measles and that means we need to get ahead before we have got large numbers of cases and large outbreaks occurring in @entity6			1
’ he said the country faced a potential national health emergency without a catch - up campaign that will be carried out by @entity67 , schools and community programmes until september			2
around one third of a million ten to 16 - year - olds who are not already vaccinated will be the ‘ first priority ’			0
a further third of a million children in this age group need at least one more @entity15 jab to give them full protection , along with a similar number above and below this age range			0
protection : the £ 20million campaign follows a big rise in cases in south @entity84 , where public health officials have been running clinics to increase protection rates ( file picture ) dr @entity89 , @entity6 head of immunisation , said there was particular concern about potential measles outbreaks in @entity94 , the @entity19 and @entity95 where @entity15 vaccination rates were historically lower than in the @entity97			1
she said older children not vaccinated as toddlers could ‘ spread infection very effectively ’ , adding : ‘ @entity98 is not a mild illness			0
it is very unpleasant and can lead to serious complications … with more than 100 children in @entity6 being hospitalised so far this year			1
’ speaking this morning on @entity107 's today programme , she added that parents often think once their child is over the age of five they are not at risk from measles			1
‘ we are worried – this is not an epidemic in @entity6 yet as the cases we have had have been clustered , but there is the potential for outbreaks to happen in other areas as there are people who have not been vaccinated			1
we really want to get ahead of that and stop this happening across @entity6			1
deputy prime minister @entity124 today confirmed that his three sons @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 have all had the @entity15 jab ‘ we have already done several things over the years ( to get children vaccinated ) and we ran a similar campaign in 2008			1
but the problem is people forget that their children are still at risk of measles over the age of five			2
‘ although people are being reminded , they do n’t realise that the measles risk does n’t stop			2
’ she added that most children born today are vaccinated before they start school but the problem is a minority who were not immunised a decade ago at the height of the @entity15 scare			0
‘ we are trying to get at the very small proportion that are left who have n’t had the injection and they are quite difficult to find			0
we are going to be asking gps to go through their records and contact parents both through the general practice and also through schools			0
’ deputy prime minister @entity124 today confirmed that his three sons @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 have all had the @entity15 jab , and said that he did not feel the need to ' cross his fingers ' as he decided to have them vaccinated			2
speaking on his @entity162 phone - in show on @entity165 radio , the @entity160 leader said : ' the overwhelming advice is that this is the right thing to do to protect the health of your child			0
' i think you have to have trust in the people who look at this			0
they have no axe to grind , they just want to do the right thing and come up with the right science			0
' they have said very categorically that the concern about a link between @entity15 and other conditions is just not proven , and they say really explicitly that it is really bad for your children 's health if you do n't take this action			0
' i really would urge parents , whatever your misgivings , do what people who know about this most say is right for your children - get that course of jabs done			0
