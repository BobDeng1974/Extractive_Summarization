one shameful statistic , if that is the right word , lies behind the dawn queues outside the @entity3 in @entity4			1
it is this : the surgery was originally designed for 6,000 patients , but now serves nearly 19,000			1
had the building in which the practice is based been a block of flats , say – and not part of the beleaguered @entity13 – it would surely have been closed down by now on the grounds of overcrowding			1
hence the reason why nursery teaching assistant @entity31 , 34 , foster carer @entity32 , 58 , and retired @entity34 , 68 , were among those who , once again , were waiting in the cold and dark outside the centre from 6.18am yesterday ; a scene repeated at @entity38 surgeries up and down the country			1
‘ @entity41 ’ , mr @entity34 called it			1
nevertheless , the surgery passed a recent @entity45 ( @entity44 ) inspection with ‘ flying colours ’ , which perhaps tells us more about the @entity44 than the @entity3			2
so what has gone wrong , or rather who is to blame for the scandal ? not the doctors who run the centre , it seems , if a newsletter issued by the centre is taken at face value			1
the extra demand is a result of new housing developments springing up in the area , the doctors say , and the ‘ very old and tired ’ health centre simply can not cope with the influx			1
they applied to @entity63 for permission to redevelop the building , but ‘ we still have no news ’			2
they applied for a grant to improve the centre ‘ but , again , we have not heard anything more ! ’ they have had meetings with the local council but ‘ despite our concerns , the council continues to grant planning permission and allow “ new builds ’ ’ in the area with no consultation			1
’ the bottom line ? @entity3 is 84 per cent undersized ( the surgery ’s phrase			2
) all this is true and has undoubtedly contributed to the crisis			2
almost 2,000 readers have commented in less than 24 hours on the @entity85 ’s picture of dozens of patients queuing before dawn to see their gp			1
here ’s what some of them said : ‘ it shames the government and local authorities who did not plan for such an increase in population			2
it does not shame @entity96 , it shames those whose job it is to plan for this ! ’ @entity101 , from @entity102 ‘ i gave up going to my gp and hospitals in 2009 and my local is not as bad as this			2
our country has become over-crowded – we do not have the amenities to cope ... ’ @entity109 , from @entity110 , south @entity111 ‘ we ca n’t get an appointment so we go to our local chemist and ask for advice			2
we have had to go to @entity115 a few times			2
if my children need to be seen within 24 hours due to ill health we go to @entity115			2
’ patient at @entity3 , @entity4 ‘ this happens here where i live			1
my husband , who is healthy , has to queue , before they open , for me to be able to see a doctor			2
they wo n’t even open the doors and allow people to wait inside , no matter what the weather is			2
’ a reader from @entity130 , @entity131 ‘ i live in @entity132 and if you need to see a doctor that day you have to queue before 8am because you ca n’t get through on the phone			2
it ’s engaged all the time			0
‘ then , when you do get through , all the appointments have gone and you get told to come down the next day before 8am and you will get an appointment then			0
how @entity139 is that ? ’ @entity132 , @entity141 ‘ my surgery is exactly the same			0
people who ’ve just come out of hospital , first - time mums with two - week - old babies , all queuing up in the dark or redialling 100 - plus times to be told “ we ’re full			0
‘ really , if you ’re not quite fit and determined , you have no chance of getting an appointment			0
so why are they still advertising for new patients to join ? ’ @entity154 , south - east @entity111 ‘ this seems to happen on every new housing development			1
there are no increased local amenities to match the increased demand			1
‘ it is down to local councillors to see that the development does not cause the problems seen here and there does appear to have been a massive failure when planning permission was granted			0
the local council should have an inquiry into that before the press do because it looks like a pretty serious breakdown in democracy			0
’ @entity175 , @entity176 ‘ most of those [ patients ] probably do n’t really need to be there – they should be visiting their local pharmacy			1
‘ but no , they do n’t want to pay for a pack of @entity183 or a bottle of @entity185 when they can get it free in prescription			0
these are the people draining the @entity13 , not the elderly who would not want to waste the @entity38 ’s time			0
’ @entity111 * have you suffered early morning queues at your gp ? email your story to : @entity194 indeed , the surgery – now one of the biggest in @entity96 – occupies less than half the existing building ( the other half is occupied by @entity199 , a private health care provider , which is responsible for the district nursing team			0
) but is this the whole story ? the fact remains that more patients equals more money – for @entity206			1
as its patient roll has increased , so has the @entity13 money flowing in to the surgery , which , like other practices , is paid £ 73.56 per patient a year			0
or , to put it another way , 6,000 patients means £ 441,360 , for @entity3 , but 19,000 patients means £ 1,397,640			1
nor is this the full extent of the financial incentives for @entity206 under the latest gp contracts , they are also paid £ 7.64 for vaccinations such as flu and @entity223 jabs and £ 55 for every patient diagnosed with dementia ; @entity206 qualify for the payment if they diagnose the patients themselves ( with no checks as to whether their assessment is right ) , or if they update their records when their patients receive diagnosis in hospital			1
some gps have condemned the scheme as an ‘ ethical travesty ’ which amounts to ‘ cash for diagnosis ’			0
either way , it means that a practice such as @entity3 – where patients have to queue at dawn to see their doctor – is also extremely lucrative			1
this is the perverse irony at the heart of this scandal			0
once upon of time , of course , the @entity13 – and , in particular , the service provided by @entity206 – was the envy of the world			0
but under the new system , introduced by the last @entity256 government in 2004 , doctors were allowed to opt out of evening and weekend work – which nine out of ten practices , including @entity3 , did			1
this brought the average gp ’s basic salary down to £ 55,000 , but , at the same time , new rules on bonus pay contained in the deal pushed their average pre-tax pay above £ 100,000			0
the new rules stated that @entity206 would earn bonuses for meeting certain performance targets – from distributing anti-smoking information to diagnosing illnesses such as depression			0
no cap was placed on the amount they could earn from the new contracts			0
as for patients , well , the daily scene outside the @entity3 speaks for itself			1
behind those scenes are patients like pensioner mr @entity34 and other personal testimonies written , in black and white on the centre ’s own website			1
‘ i called every ten minutes from 7am until 8.45am ( when i finally spoke to someone to only be told that all the appointments had gone … looking to changing doctors			1
would n’t wish this practice on my worst enemy , ’ wrote one @entity288 added : ‘ tried for two hours to get past the engaged tone then waited in a queue of five to wait to be answered			0
’ a third revealed : ‘ i have been on hold for 45 minutes , told i am caller number one for 35 minutes and still have n’t spoken to receptionist			0
when i tried the automated system yesterday , soonest appointment was a week ’s time – even though the medical centre is next door to my house			0
’ the surgery was originally designed for 6,000 patients , but now serves nearly 19,000 ( file picture ) the surgery has 12 gps , four of them recruited in the past two years to cope with increased demand , and hopes to recruit more			1
but two new housing developments are also in the pipeline which are likely to place further strain on the oversubscribed health centre			1
the first of these , at the famous @entity310 race track , could see more than 1,000 homes being built			0
a second is an application to build 196 houses on the site of @entity318 rugby club ’s former training ground in @entity3 , which is currently going through the planning process at @entity320			0
‘ the council would be very keen to support new or improved health facilities in @entity326 , ’ said head of planning @entity322			0
‘ however , these need to be supported by the relevant health funding bodies			0
to date , they have not given us specific proposals and neither have they made specific funding requests			0
’ in fact , more gp practices than ever are reaching capacity and applying for permission to refuse new patients , with the number of requests to reject additional patients soaring by 160 per cent in three years , according to @entity341			1
has the @entity3 made such an application ? after all , the surgery has blamed the crisis on a dramatic increase in the number of patients ( 19,000 , remember ) now on its roll ? a spokesman for the centre said no such request had been made ‘ because closing the list would be detrimental to local people who may wish to register with us as patients			1
’ additional reporting by @entity357			0
