the federal government has approved air combat operations in @entity2 to fight @entity4 extremists			1
the decision to send in @entity6 as part of a @entity9 - led mission came after a meeting of the national security committee and cabinet in @entity13 on friday			1
' today cabinet has authorised @entity17 air strikes in @entity2 at the request of the @entity2 government in support of the @entity2 government , ' prime minister @entity14 said			1
' six @entity6 , a @entity40 surveillance aircraft , a @entity41 and a special forces contingent have been pre-deployed to the @entity43			2
@entity17 ended its military commitment to @entity2 in july 2009 , after six years of war involving more than 20,000 personnel			1
he warned the mission would be ' quite lengthy ' and would be months rather than weeks			1
' i want to assure the @entity17 people this will be as long as it needs to be , and as short as it possibly can be , ' he said			2
only @entity2 can defeat @entity54 , but @entity2 should n't and wo n't be alone , mr @entity14 said			1
mr @entity14 warned it would be a dangerous mission			1
but he 's confident the @entity56 has all possible measures to minimise risk in place			0
@entity61 aircraft set to participate in attacks on @entity4 jihadists have conducted their first training missions in the @entity32 region ' it is a combat deployment , but it is an essentially humanitarian mission to protect the people of @entity2 and ultimately the people of @entity17 from the murderous rage of the @entity71 death cult , ' mr @entity14 said			1
' it is absolutely in @entity17 's national interests that this mission go ahead			2
' mr @entity14 says opposition leader @entity75 has given his full support			2

' the air traffic group 's been flying supporting missions and some training missions over @entity2 for the last couple of days and we 're ready to get on with the job			0
' the prime minister again refused to rule out potential involvement in @entity100 and cautioned against trying to predict future missions			1
' let 's focus on what 's being done today rather than speculate on what might be done in months or years to come , ' he said			0
success would be evident when the @entity2 government was restoring control over its own cities and towns and when @entity54 was in retreat			0
' if we could degrade them to the point where they no longer existed that would be obviously the best possible result			0
' but mr @entity14 warned that @entity17 was not at war			1
' i know that you 'd love to have that headline , but it 's not strictly accurate , ' he told reporters			0
' yes , we are engaged in combat operations			0
