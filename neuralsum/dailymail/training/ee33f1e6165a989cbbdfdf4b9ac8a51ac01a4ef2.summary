more than a million selfies are taken every day , and a third of us admit to digitally retouching our self - portraits before uploading them online			1
but researchers from the @entity6 claim that many of these images could be improved simply taking note of some of their tips			1
for example , when using a smartphone , the closer the person can get to the lens the better when trying to capture the perfect selfie			1
but when using a smartphone , place the camera at arm 's length , and hold the phone in landscape when taking group shots ( @entity22 selfie is pictured ) a conventional digital camera 's wide - angle lens should be positioned further away from the subject and zoomed in , to achieve a more accurate perspective			1
on smartphone cameras , however , a person can be positioned much closer to the phone			2
this is because the lens and sensor are smaller , so can be used for close - up shots while maintaining the correct amount of separation			0
for portraits , the best photos have the shallowest depth of field , meaning the subject is in focus			1
to achieve this on a digital camera , choose a larger aperture , which will have a lower number on the settings menu			1
focus can be adjusted on smartphones by tapping the screen			2
in terms of lighting , dr @entity56 and dr @entity57 claim that photos should not be back - lit , meaning the light is in front of the subject , rather than behind it			1
there should also be less separation between the light and dark areas			0
this means using more lights , or bouncing the light off another surface			0
dr @entity57 and dr @entity56 , photography experts and research fellows from the @entity6 , revealed the tips during their ‘ a @entity80 - the science behind good photos ’ talk at the @entity79 this weekend			1
when using a digital camera , dr @entity56 and dr @entity57 said that a wide - angle lens needs to be positioned further away from the subject and zoomed in , to achieve a more accurate perspective			1
when a wide - angle lens is too close to a subject , the distance from the lens is approximately the same distance between the subject ’s features			0
this causes the image to be distorted			0
a selfie - stick can be used to get extra distance between the lens and face			0
however , these tips only typically work with wide - angle lenses			2

in terms of lighting , dr @entity56 and dr @entity57 claim that photos should not be back - lit , meaning the light is in front of the subject , rather than behind it			1
there should also be less separation between the light and dark areas			0
for example , a single bright light producers darker , more harsh shadows because there ’s a clear separation			0
by increasing the number of lights , or bouncing it off another surface , this separation is reduced and creates a softer light , which is better for portraits			0

by adjusting these settings , light hitting the sensor can be ‘ drowned out by noise ’ , from the camera			2
this can cause images to become grainy dr @entity56 advises against taking photos in the midday sun , for this reason , or underneath strip lights			1
umbrellas can also be placed over a bulb to soften the light when taking a selfie			0
in terms of exposure , smartphones typically have automatic settings , but on digital cameras , photographers can tweak the sensitivity , also known as @entity181 to improve the amount of light that hits the shutter			0
by adjusting these settings , however , in low lighting for example , the small amount of light hitting the sensor can be ‘ drowned out by noise ’ , from the camera			1
this can cause images to become grainy .			0

tips were given by dr @entity57 and dr @entity56 at @entity6
they *explained* how to get the best focus and lighting from a digital camera
this also included tips on managing perspective and depth of field
