@entity1 low - cost carrier , @entity2 , has just acquired its 69th plane and has found an interesting way to celebrate			1
not only has the airline slashed roundtrip fairs to Â£ 69 in april and may - including taxes and fees - but they also announced such a drastic price drop with some rather cheeky copy			1
the emails sent around announcing the sale reference a particular sexual act in very blatant terms , with some customers complaining that the new campaign is in poor taste			1
' it 's our favorite number -- ever since we were twelve and found that magazine under our brother 's bed ( the one with the fantastic articles )			0
' # 69 is perfect : just the right size , with a cockpit that 's in your face ( because it 's bright yellow )			2
' use your mouth to spread the word : spirit is in an even better position to get you where you 're going			0
' spirit has long taken a tongue - in - cheek approach to its promotions , calling itself the ' home of the bare fare ' the company has already used the provocative slogan , ' @entity50 , ' when discussing their competitive pricing in the past			0
in fact , the phrase is currently emblazoned on several of its aircraft			2
in much the same vein , @entity2 spokesman @entity57 said , in a statement , that the latest campaign was simply a reflection of the airline 's unconventional and quirky personality			1
' @entity2 is n't your typical airline and we do n't want to be			1
' we enjoy being different than other airlines			0
' spokesman , @entity57 , has said that the latest campaign is simply a reflection of @entity2 's quirky personality however , some customers have took to social media to question if the ad campaign has gone a bit too far ' when it comes to advertising , different means we do n't spend a lot of money on advertising -- because that just increases fares			1
' but we 're also different because our ads are fun , provocative , sometimes silly and often irreverent			0
' they get lots of attention			0
' the vast majority of our customers find these types of ads humorous and accept them for what they are			2
we understand there is a small group of people who feel differently			0

to celebrate their newest aircraft , @entity2 is *offering* *$* 69 roundtrip fares

some customers have complained that the campaign is in poor taste
