by @entity0 last updated at 10:10 am on 30th december 2011 @entity1 is the word that springs to mind when you see the picturesque @entity5 village of @entity6			1
traditional homes made of local stone blend into surrounding countryside and sit comfortably alongside the historic manor house , once the estate of the @entity13 drinks family			1
but the village ’s well - heeled residents fear all that will change – thanks to a dramatically designed new house described by some as an ‘ ugly cowshed ’			1
under construction : this contemporary home has labelled an eyesore by villagers in @entity6 , @entity26 picturesque : most of the buildings in @entity6 , which has a population of around 350 and was once home to the estate of the @entity33 drinks family , are made from local stone they fear the building , which in its current partially built state has light - coloured walls and a shiny metallic roof , will set a precedent that will permanently alter @entity6 ’s character			1
the owner of the modern property – who could not be contacted by the @entity44 yesterday – has been granted planning permission , but residents say they were not made aware of last - minute changes to the plans			1
@entity49 , 78 , a retired farm manager who has lived in @entity6 since 1971 , said : ‘ most of the houses around here are built of lovely @entity5 stone and all fit in			1
‘ it is so nice around here			2
but this one looks like an ugly cowshed			2
it has a massive tin roof and it is spoiling the view of many people around here			2
‘ it just does not look good at all			2
this is a traditional @entity5 village with a proud history			2
it used to be home to the @entity33 family			0
‘ the planners should not let a home like this be built in the first place			0
we ’ve contacted the local council about it and they said it ’s not finished and we should wait until it ’s done before we say it does n’t fit in with the village			0
‘ we just want the planning department to do its job properly			0
’ @entity6 , near @entity81 , has a population of around 350			1
planning permission for the controversial new property was sought in 2002 , originally for a studio and craft centre			0
in the dark : villagers are furious that the modern property is being built when they were unaware of last - minute changes to the plans neighbour @entity49 , 78 , is one of many residents whose property overlooks the new - build , which he describes as an ' ugly cowshed ' consent was finally granted last year after the designs were altered to include a bathroom and a bedroom , turning it into a contemporary home			1
@entity101 , who has lived in the village since 1996 , claimed residents had not been consulted about the development			1
he said : ‘ when the original application was made in 2002 it was for a studio and a craft centre , but it ’s just got bigger and bigger			0
‘ in 2010 the plans were changed so the roof is flat rather than curved and an additional bedroom and a bathroom were added and we were n’t notified			1
we ’ve been to the planning office and the files are a complete mess			0
‘ we are worried it could set a precedent and someone could come along and try to build another one			0
’ @entity122 defended the development – stressing that all the correct procedures had been followed in the planning process			0
a spokesman said : ‘ while we acknowledge that the contemporary design may not be to everyone ’s taste , we can confirm that all the appropriate processes have been followed in regard to this planning permission			0
‘ anyone who has queries is welcome to review the relevant reports sent to the planning committee and the delegated approvals			0

residents of @entity6 claim they were not shown changes to building plans
