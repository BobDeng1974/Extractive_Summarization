actor @entity8 is pictured @entity2 scientists have taken the first steps to reverse the effects of dwarfism and believe the treatment could be used on humans as early as in three years ' time			1
they think the dramatic effects of dwarfism , which can be caused by over 200 distinct medical conditions and can include painful complications , could be treated with injections of protein			0
the researchers made their ' breakthrough ' by injecting a protein molecule into mice with dwarfism for three months , which allowed them to grow fully			1
@entity27 , a researcher at the @entity28 in @entity29 , told @entity30 : ' the treatment is so simple – it ’s just the injection of a protein and the results show it really helped			1
' ' this is a first and although there are more steps we need to take before trials on humans , nothing so far has indicated it could n’t also work for people with dwarfism			0
' scientists injected the mice ( which had the condition achondroplasia , which is a genetic mutation that causes the vast majority of human cases of dwarfism ) with protein twice a week over a period of three weeks			2
dr @entity27 said that as three weeks is roughly equivalent to 15 human years for mice , a similar treatment could work on children with achondroplasia without needing daily injections			1
the researchers think the dramatic effects of dwarfism , which can be caused by over 200 distinct medical conditions and can include painful complications , could be treated with injections of protein however , the treatment would not suit people past puberty , according to the study , which was published in the journal @entity68			2
the researchers have more tests to conduct on mice to see if the treatment can be delayed , or whether it has to be started straight after birth , before testing it on a larger animal , which could be a primate			0
she said : ' we could be ready within three to five years to treat humans with this technique			0
' dr @entity27 also believes the molecule injection relieved conditions associated with dwarfism , which can include lumbar and cervical pain as well as respiratory problems and muscular weakness			0
@entity86 , vice-president of the @entity87 for people of @entity89 , told @entity30 cautiously welcomed the advance in the research , but that the goal should not be to eradicate dwarfism , which effects between 8,000 and 10,000 people in @entity2 alone			0
