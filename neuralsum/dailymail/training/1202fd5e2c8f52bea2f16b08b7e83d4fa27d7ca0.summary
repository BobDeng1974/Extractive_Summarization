exotic animals can make popular pets but a cat with a touch of the supernatural will stand out in among the neighbours ’ moggies			0
a new breed of cat that looks like a werewolf and behaves like a dog has been developed by @entity12 breeders the @entity13 gets its spooky looks because of a genetic mutation in a domestic shorthair cat , which prevents the curious creature from growing a full coat of fur , making it looks like a werewolf			1
the werewolf character from the 1981 film , @entity40 in @entity41 , is pictured the @entity13 gets its spooky looks because of a genetic mutation in a domestic shorthair cat , which prevents the curious creature from growing a full coat of fur			1
its name comes from the @entity49 for wolf and translates as ‘ wolf cat			0
the animal has no hair around its eyes , nose , ears and muzzle as well as a consistently patchy coat on the rest of its body			1
it behaves like a dog as it hunts for prey and toys and is also friendly and loyal to owners			1
due to incomplete hair follicles , the cat has a patchy coat , moults and can go completely bald some of the time			1
a total of 14 litters of kittens not from the original litter have been reported and there are just seven breeders registered in the world			0
its name comes from the @entity49 for ' wolf ' and translates as ‘ wolf cat ’ as the animal has no hair around its eyes , nose , ears and muzzle as well as a consistently patchy coat on the rest of its body			1
curiously @entity87 are said to have a ‘ hound dog personality ’			0
‘ they like to hunt around the house for whatever they can find			0
' they show caution to strangers , but warm up quickly and become very friendly , ’ according to the breed ’s website			2
perhaps in parallel to supernatural werewolf characters , the cats have a ‘ strong prey drive ’ that ‘ causes them to stalk and pounce on everything they consider to be prey			1
’ however , unlike a werewolf , whose personality chances at full moon , @entity87 are said to be friendly and playful as well as loyal to their owners			0
the @entity13 ( pictured left and right ) gets its spooky looks because of a genetic mutation in a domestic shorthair cat , which prevents the curious creature from growing a full coat of fur , making it looks like a werewolf the @entity13 's name comes from the @entity49 for wolf and translates as ' wolf cat ' as the animal has no hair around its eyes , nose , ears and muzzle as well as a patchy coat on the rest of its body ( pictured ) the first official @entity87 came about as the result of a natural mutation of the shorthair cat			1
‘ the gene is a natural mutation that appeared in the domestic cat population , ’ said @entity137			2
‘ there was no human intervention to create the cat			0
we are simply using the genetics of natural processes , ’ he added			0
there were three ‘ foundation breeders ’ – mr @entity137 , his wife @entity149 and @entity150 , who located the first two kittens , while it was mr @entity137 used cats from two groups of kittens to breed the first @entity13 kittens			1
they found that the cats were not a @entity159 ( a breed of hairless cat ) that had retained some of its fur and this was confirmed by dna testing that did not find the @entity159 gene			0
in fact , researchers found that a new breed had been created , but they wanted to make sure the kittens were completely healthy before breeding them			0
tests were run to rule out genetic illnesses and dermatologists at the @entity176 examined the animals for skin abnormalities researchers wanted to make sure the kittens were completely healthy before breeding them looking out for the full moon ? unlike a werewolf , whose personality chances suddenly , @entity87 are said to be friendly and playful as well as loyal to their owners tests were run to rule out genetic illnesses and dermatologists at the @entity176 examined the animals for skin abnormalities			2
while none were found , the scientists were stumped at first as to what had caused the strange coat			0
they then found that some of the animals ' hair follicles lacked all the components needed to create hair and that follicles that did have an undercoat were imbalanced so the hair could not be maintained			1
consequently the cats moult and can go completely bald some of the time – not just on a full moon			2
the first official @entity87 ( like the one pictured ) arose from a natural mutation in black domestic shorthair cats it is hoped that the felines will be categorised as a ' preliminary new breed ' by the @entity213 ( @entity213 ) this coming @entity214 when they will be able to be shown at cat shows			1
a total of 14 litters of kittens not from the original litter have been reported and there are just seven @entity13 breeders registered in the world , making the kittens hot property			2
mr @entity137 said that breeders get requests for the unusual kittens daily and he gets asked about the breed at least ten times a day			0
‘ we are doing our very best to monitor breeding cats to ensure that the @entity13 cat will be a new breed that has wonderful health , great personality , and the @entity13 ( werecat ) look , ’ he said			2
it is hoped the felines will be categorised as a ' preliminary new breed ' by the @entity213 this coming @entity214 bald beauty : the cats moult and can go completely bald some of the time because of incomplete hair follicles			1
