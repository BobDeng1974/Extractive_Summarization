by @entity0 published : 18:00 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 01:21 est , 22 august 2013 if those fine lines on your face appear to be multiplying , it may be that your mother is to blame			0
scientists have found a set of genes passed down only by mothers that appear to influence the ageing process			1
when the inherited dna is defective , the result is premature ageing – not only wrinkles but a shorter lifespan – a study says			0
the researchers discovered that damage to our mitochondria – the tiny powerhouses in our cells that turn the food we eat into energy – speeds up age - related conditions			0
normal and damaged dna is passed down from generation to generation			0
but while the dna that influences how we develop comes from both parents and is held within a cell nucleus , the genes in mitochondria are entirely separate and come only from our mother			1
following experiments on mice , the researchers found defective @entity41 can result in serious genetic diseases			0
but even mild inherited damage can accelerate the ageing process			1
writing in the journal nature , lead researcher professor @entity62 from the @entity63 in @entity36 , said : ‘ our mother ’s mitochondrial dna seems to influence our own ageing			1
if we inherit @entity41 with mutations from our mother , we age more quickly			2
with @entity70 as a mother @entity69 ( left ) has little to worry about as she gets older ‘ ageing is the accumulation of various types of cell damage			1
much of the damage will be a result of environmental and lifestyle factors , which means the inheriting @entity41 damage can never be the only explanation for ageing			2
but it is an important part of the ageing process			2
’ mitochondria , the power houses of every cell , may be responsible for how we age defective @entity41 is implicated in a host of age - related diseases such as heart problems , diabetes and neurodegenerative conditions including dementia			2
over the course of our lifetime @entity41 is more susceptible to damage than normal dna , the researchers said			2
when inherited mutations are added to those that occur naturally , it can cause us to age prematurely			0
ageing comes about as a result of damage to the body ’s cells , making it more likely for an individual to suffer from an age - related disease or condition such as cancer , heart problems – as well as wrinkles			0
professor @entity112 of @entity113 , an expert on mitochondria , said : ‘ this is very interesting			0
the genes you inherit can have some effect on the ageing process , but the most important factor still remains your lifestyle			1
’ although damaged @entity41 passed down from a mother to children could influence the ageing process , it is still unclear to what extent			1
but the research could help scientists find ways to slow the ageing process in humans using drug treatments , diets or supplements			1
a co-author of the study , dr @entity134 of @entity135 in @entity136 , @entity137 , said various foods and drugs can counter mitochondrial damage , including antioxidants .			0

scientists *suggest* that the ageing process depends on mitochondria
mutations in mitochondrial dna ( @entity41 ) causes the cell damage
these mutations can be passed down by our mothers in our genes
opens door to new treatments against ageing *targeting* @entity41
