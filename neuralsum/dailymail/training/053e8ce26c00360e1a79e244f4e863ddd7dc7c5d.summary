@entity6 , 31 , of @entity7 , was diagnosed with @entity8 - a type of vasculitis - after she was admitted to hospital with severe flu - like symptoms			1
as medics struggled to stabilise her , mrs @entity13 required steroids and medication to suppress her immune system as well as chemotherapy which she was warned could leave her unable to conceive children			1
welcome addition : @entity6 and @entity22 feel blessed to be raising their baby daughter after she was diagnosed with @entity25 's @entity8 support : @entity6 said she could n't have managed without @entity22 following her diagnosis at first she did n't realise how serious her condition was and did n't want to bother doctors because she thought she just had the flu			1
she said : ' at first they were classic flu - like symptoms - an achy neck , a persistent headache and a runny nose			1
' i was dedicated to work so the idea of taking time off was unthinkable			0
besides , i thought the symptoms would clear up on their own			2
i resisted going to see a doctor because i thought i 'd be laughed out of the waiting room			0
' but her partner @entity22 and colleagues at the radio station where she worked , seeing her struggle urged her to seek medical help when her symptoms worsened			1
treatment : holly during one of her hospital stays she said : ' my appetite completely disappeared , which is unusual because i like my food			2
i was sleeping more and more , and when i blew my nose there was quite a lot of blood			2
' i would go to bed telling @entity22 that i hoped i would feel better , but there was never any improvement			1
' when the advisor at @entity64 heard i had been coughing up blood , she explained that i should go to seek help immediately			2
' ordeal : her condition rapidly deteriorated and soon she was critically ill in hospital she was initially diagnosed with tracheitis - inflammation of the windpipe - but two days into a course of antibiotics her condition continued to deteriorate and @entity22 took her directly to @entity75			1
there , doctors ordered blood tests which returned abnormal results and gave her a chest x-ray which revealed lesions in her lungs			1
she said : ' i had some hearing loss and my gum tissue started falling away , so that i could see more and more of my teeth			2
red , gritty material was coming from my eyes and i struggled to stay conscious			0
' my mum arrived on the ward , took one look at me , and started demanding clear answers from the consultants			0
a lot of different ideas had been mentioned - that it was pneumonia or cancer - but nothing was clear			2
' she underwent a nasal biopsy which confirmed @entity103 € ™ s @entity8 - a rare incurable condition which causes inflammation of the blood vessels and turns the immune system against itself			1
she said : ' my vital signs dropped during the biopsy			0
i remember one of the doctors leaning over and telling me that the crash team were on standby - i thought , " oh my @entity113 , what 's going on ? " ' @entity8 is usually associated with elderly people - it was quite rare for a 26 - year - old to be diagnosed with it			1
' following the diagnosis , @entity6 was prescribed steroids and medication to suppress her immune system , and warned that she would need chemotherapy , which can leave patients infertile			1
the news was a devastating blow as she and @entity22 , 36 , an export manager , had planned to start a family after their wedding the following winter			1
she said : ' @entity22 and i really wanted children			1
after a lot of soul - searching i chose not to start chemotherapy straight away because i knew it could make me infertile , and just hoped the other medication would make me feel better			1
' despite the limited effects of the drugs , she was able to return home for @entity141 , on the condition she returned to hospital for twice - weekly checkups			1
by the time she was discharged , she had been in hospital for two and a half weeks			2
she recalled : ' @entity22 probably had it the hardest of all			1
he had to watch me as i was very ill. @entity149 were running high at the time , particularly when i heard i would n't be able to have children			0
i did n't know how much better i was going to get			0
' i suggested it might be best if we did n't get married			2
but @entity22 was adamant - he wanted to stay close to me as we got through the difficult times together			1
i couldnâ € ™ t have managed without him			0
' wedding bells : @entity6 , who underwent her last chemotherapy session just a week before her wedding to @entity22 , says the day was all the more poignant because of what they were going through @entity6 started chemotherapy in may and underwent her last session just a week before the couple 's wedding in september 2009			1
she said : ' i 'd experienced hair loss and my face had swelled due to the steroids			0
i was weak , but it was still the most fabulous day			0
it was all the more poignant because of what we were going through			0
' despite the odds stacked against them the couple began trying for a baby 18 months after their wedding			2
@entity6 said : ' i was taken off a course of medication which had prevented us from trying			0
we thought we had nothing to lose and , nearly two years to the day after we married , i fell pregnant			2
it was wonderful when we found out			0
' in may 2012 , the couple 's daughter , @entity182 , was born			1
@entity6 said : ' as i held @entity182 after she was born i felt as if i already knew her			0
i delivered her a little bit early on medical advice , because my symptoms had flared up , but everything i went through during the pregnancy was worth it			2
' she said : ' she 's very sociable and has a cracking personality			0
she looks like @entity22 and is quite decisive , like me			1
' miracle baby : @entity6 and her daughter @entity182 , now 20 months old since her diagnosis , @entity6 has become a trustee of @entity195 , a charity which supports research into the diagnosis and treatment of vasculitis , and has launched a support group for patients in @entity203			0
she said : ' this experience has made me change my life			0
if i think back to the 26 - year - old i was , my life is completely different now			0
i 've had to make some big adaptations , but that does n't mean i 'm unhappy with the life i have - i 'm very happy			1
' the disease is incurable			0
i know it 's something i 'll have to cope with for the rest of my life , but i feel like i can get through it with my family			0
the challenges we face wo n't break us			0
