@entity2 confesses to helping @entity3 drive his leading rivals out of the @entity5 by using the dark arts of media manipulation			1
in the disturbingly candid book , serialised in the @entity17 , the spin doctor says he routinely discredited opponents by tipping off newspapers about ‘ drug use , spousal abuse , alcoholism and extra-marital affairs ’			1
coming from a figure so central to mr @entity3 ’s political operation , the book will hugely embarrass @entity27 and @entity28 , the former prime minister ’s two closest allies			1
the pair were in constant contact with mr @entity2 , raising urgent questions over what they knew of his brutal tactics			0
the memoir will send shockwaves through the @entity39 ahead of next week ’s annual conference			0

the emails included fabricated slurs about the politicians ’ health and private lives			0
his book @entity54 , which will be published next week , tells the inside story of his own downfall , which plunged mr @entity3 ’s @entity57 into scandal and chaos from which it never recovered			2
it gives the inside track of the years of bitter infighting between mr @entity3 and @entity63 , the spinning and plotting that ended the careers of senior ministers and the banking collapse that came close to plunging @entity70 into anarchy			2
many of the key figures in his story are still leading lights in @entity76 , which he brands ‘ the binge drinking capital of @entity70 ’			0

spin : @entity3 attending the @entity88 in @entity89 in 2009 with @entity2 ( left ) ‘ some people will undoubtedly wonder why – if @entity3 knew i was guilty of misbehaviour – he never either formally reined me in or had me moved on , ’ he writes			2
‘ and my answer to that is simply that there was something unspoken between us ... the unspoken word was from me to him , and said : “ do n’t question my methods ”			0

newspapers were duped into thinking the pair were bitter rivals over home affairs policy – and the apparent feud contributed to mr @entity63 sacking mr @entity102 in 2006			2
mr @entity2 later told journalists mr @entity63 had been in tears as he dismissed him			0
he also confesses to helping to destroy @entity105 , who was the one remaining ‘ obstacle ’ when mr @entity3 finally had the chance to run for the leadership			1

lord @entity105 was alleged to have asked miss @entity139 to go to bed with him during a parliamentary trip to @entity144 in the late 1980s and later told her at a bar in the @entity132 : ‘ i want sex with you			0
’ married miss @entity139 was said to have been outraged and told him to stop pestering her			0

the book will hugely embarrass @entity27 and @entity28 , the former prime minister ’s two closest allies the book goes on to reveal that while he remained publicly neutral in the @entity12 leadership contest that followed his defeat in the 2010 election , mr @entity3 privately backed @entity27			1
he was determined to prevent @entity163 , an arch - @entity164 , winning the race and taking the party down routes he had resisted for a decade			0
