for a favourite toy , some dogs will do anything			2
diving head first into a swimming pool , these animals do n't let a bit of water keep them from their balls and chew figures			1
the steely determination of the petshave been captured by underwater portrait and dog photographer @entity13			1
photographer @entity13 has captured dogs diving into a swimming pool to catch their toys mr @entity19 said the determination and expression of the dogs shows their primeval hunting instinct the 42 - year - old , of @entity26 , @entity27 , decided to combine his love of dogs with his passion for underwater photography and place himself at the bottom of a hydrotherapy pool , alongside some treasured dog toys			1
' freezing the moment a dog breaks through the surface of the water in pursuit of a toy or treat often captures it 's primeval hunting instinct and is exaggerated by the way its body takes on fascinating forms within the water , ' said mr @entity19			0
mr @entity19 started photographing dogs when he launched a new business that was meant to capture babies swimming underwater			2
he said : ' i found it impossible to persuade anyone to allow me to put a dog in their pool for me to photograph until a chance meeting in a shop with a canine hydrotherapist allowed my dream to become a reality			0
' i suggested we gather some dogs who were keen swimmers and produce a calendar of underwater dogs , we only had a couple of weeks to organise the shoot , but it was a great success			2
' after the canine calendar the success continued and mr @entity19 joined forces with @entity69 , a hotel and training facility for dogs in @entity73 , @entity27			1
the hotel 's hydrotherapy pool provided the perfect location to photograph pets underwater			0
the animals have been photographed in stealthy pursuit of their favourite toys and balls under the water mr @entity19 said he enjoyed capturing the movement and expressions of the dogs as they dived the animals have been pictured jumping into a swimming pool - very different from lakes and the sea he added : ' it 's difficult to predict the exact spot a dog will enter the water so i target my camera on a toy floating on the surface whilst the owner or assistant keeps the dog from jumping in			1
' once i 'm ready and happy the dog is focused on its toy , i call for the dog to be released			0
' the process is repeated several times to allow for me to achieve a variety of perspectives			0
' one of the most rewarding aspects of my work is to observe the amazing reactions my pictures evoke , especially from a client seeing their own dog captured in this unusual perspective			0
dogs seemed excited and determined to capture their favourite toys , however far they sunk in the water some dogs surprise their owners by teetering on the edge of swimming pools while others go straight in ' although people find my pictures compelling , a handful of people have said they find some of my photos " scary			1
'' ' mr @entity19 said one of the key problems he faces is dogs that will not take part , looking gingerly over the edge of the water instead			0
he added : ' often an owner will come to me believing their dog will dive straight in as it loves swimming in the sea , rivers or ponds			0
' however , a swimming pool can be an alien environment for many dogs as the water is clear and smells very different			1
