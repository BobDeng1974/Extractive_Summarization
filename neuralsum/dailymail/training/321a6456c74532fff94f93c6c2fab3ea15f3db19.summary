the highest - ranking @entity1 official to visit @entity2 in more than three decades said friday that two days of talks on re-establishing full diplomatic relations had left her with no sense of whether the new @entity1 policy of engagement would achieve its goal of generating reforms that benefit the @entity2 people			1
the @entity13 administration says the goal of its @entity2 policy remains the same : creating more freedoms for ordinary @entity2			0
@entity2 diplomats said throughout the negotiations in @entity19 that the @entity1 needs to abandon hopes of using closer relations to foment change on the island			1
assistant secretary of state @entity24 told reporters friday that the talks had left her with no clearer idea of whether @entity13 's new policy has good prospects of success			1
' it 's very hard to say exactly how this will work , ' @entity24 said			0
' we think that we need to make decisions in our own interest and take decision that are to going to empower the @entity2 people but the verdict on whether that succeeds is still to be made			0
but it was n't immediately clear whether the human rights issue , which has previously blocked closer @entity1 - @entity2 relations , would pose a threat to the new diplomatic process			1
' @entity2 has never responded to pressure , ' @entity59 , the country 's top diplomat for @entity1 affairs , told reporters thursday night			2
the comments by @entity24 and @entity65 lay bare the pressures each side faces at home – the @entity1 , from @entity70 leaders in @entity71 and powerful @entity2 - @entity73 groups , and @entity2 , from hardliners deeply concerned that rapprochement could undermine the communist system founded by @entity77			1
earlier in the week , @entity24 hailed the talks as ' positive and productive , ' focusing on the mechanics of converting interest sections into full - fledged embassies headed by ambassadors			0
but she also spoke of ' profound differences ' separating the two governments and said embassies by themselves would not mean normalized ties			0
along with human rights , @entity2 outlined other obstacles in the relationship			2
@entity65 demanded that @entity2 be taken off the @entity1 list of state sponsors of terrorism			1
however , she praised @entity13 for easing the @entity1 trade embargo and urging the @entity71 to lift it entirely			2
' it was a first meeting			0
this is a process , ' @entity65 said			0
in the next weeks , she said , the @entity1 and @entity2 will schedule a second round of talks , which may or may not be the time to finalize an agreement			0
issues on thursday 's agenda included ending caps on staff , limits on diplomats ' movements and , in the case of the @entity1 building , removing guard posts and other @entity2 structures along the perimeter			2
earlier , the two countries disputed whether human rights had even been discussed at all			0
@entity24 said the @entity1 raised it in the morning meeting ; @entity65 said it had not come up			0
@entity118 , @entity2 's deputy chief of @entity73 affairs , later said the delegations spent time in an afternoon session discussing @entity1 human rights problems – a reference to recent police killings of black men in @entity126 and @entity127			1
not ordinary : a journalist records a video with a tablet of @entity118 , @entity2 's deputy chief of @entity73 affairs , during the history talks not easy : @entity73 negotiators including @entity24 , flanked by @entity133 , second left , chief of mission at the @entity136 in @entity19 , and deputy assistant secretary of the @entity139 @entity138 , second right , are butting heads with their @entity2 counterparts @entity2 state media said the @entity2 delegation also complained about the detention of prisoners at the @entity1 base in @entity148			1
a @entity1 official said the difference in @entity24 's statements was unintentional and that the @entity153 version – that the @entity1 ' pressed the @entity2 government for improved human rights conditions , including freedom of expression ' – reflected the delegation 's position			1
the @entity1 and @entity2 also talked about human trafficking , environmental protection , @entity73 rules to allow greater telecommunications exports to @entity2 and how to coordinate responses to oil spills or @entity167 outbreaks			1
the need for at least one future round of talks could set back @entity1 hopes of reopening the embassies before april 's @entity173 , which @entity13 and @entity77 are expected to attend			2
still , after so many years of mutual suspicion , each side stressed the importance of the collegial atmosphere in @entity19 that included long working lunches and a dinner together .			0

@entity2 diplomats said throughout negotiations that the @entity1 needs to abandon hopes of using closer relations to foment change on the island
one top @entity2 official said the delegations spent time talking about @entity1 's human rights problems – including recent police shootings
the @entity1 *president* wants to reopen an embassy in @entity19 and end the 50 - year - old @entity73 trade embargo
the @entity200 hopes to use that *carrot* to push the @entity77 regime to make advances toward democracy , but that might be a losing battle
@entity2 is demanding that the @entity200 remove it from the @entity1 list of state sponsors of terrorism
