families will enjoy the biggest boost to their finances for more than a decade as inflation is set to tumble to zero while wages rise			1
inflation has already plunged to 0.3 per cent – its lowest level since 1960 – after a big fall in the cost of essentials such as food and fuel			1
and @entity13 governor @entity12 told @entity14 yesterday that it would ‘ likely fall further to around zero in the coming months , and remain near there for much of the year ’			1
that means @entity29 households can expect their biggest boost in spending power since 2001 , experts say			2
chancellor @entity32 hopes that the easing pressure on family finances and the continuing economic recovery will help the @entity36 at may ’s general election			0
@entity39 strategists believe the party ’s move ahead of @entity42 in recent opinion polls shows more voters are starting to feel the benefits of the economic turnaround			0
@entity42 planned to make a ‘ cost of living crisis ’ a major election issue , but the news seems to support @entity39 claims that their economic plan is working			0
last night the @entity51 hailed mr @entity12 ’s inflation forecast as ‘ good news ’ for households			1
mr @entity12 , giving evidence to the @entity57 economic affairs committee , said : ‘ the combination of rising wages and weak headline inflation will strengthen household finances and boost real take - home pay growth this year to the fastest rate in a decade			1
in turn , this will support continued solid growth in consumer spending			0
’ inflation has already hit the lowest level on record - hitting just 0.3 per cent in january - but mr @entity12 said it would be ' extremely foolish ' to slash interest rates to try to get inflation back to its target rate of 2 per cent mr @entity12 warned that interest rates are likely to rise at some point – but said that when that happens the increases will be ‘ gradual ’ and ‘ limited ’			1
rates have been frozen at a record low of 0.5 per cent for more than six years			2
there has been speculation that the @entity13 could cut rates even further – towards zero – if inflation threatened to fall too far and turn into a dangerous bout of deflation			1
such a move would spell misery for savers – who have already missed out on around £ 130billion in interest payments because of ultra-low rates – but would be welcomed by borrowers			2
but mr @entity12 yesterday insisted that it would be ‘ extremely foolish ’ to cut rates to counter the uncontrollable fall in global oil prices			1
he said it would risk adding ‘ unnecessary volatility in inflation ’ and that he expects inflation to return to its 2 per cent target ‘ within two years ’			2
a report by the @entity102 , published today , predicts interest rates will rise to 0.75 per cent ‘ no earlier ’ than the first three months of next year			1
the @entity102 is also raising its @entity29 growth forecasts from 2.6 per cent to 2.7 per cent for this year and from 2.4 per cent to 2.6 per cent in 2016			0
that follows expansion of 2.6 per cent last year – when the @entity29 was the fastest growing economy in the @entity109 group of leading nations			0
growth is expected to pick up to 0.7 per cent in the first three months of this year following a 0.5 per cent rise in output in the final quarter of last year			1
@entity115 , director general of the @entity102 , said : ‘ businesses up and down the country are doing well despite international and domestic uncertainty			0
‘ while 2015 has got off to a good start , there is no room for complacency			0
the @entity29 is still a long way from achieving the great , sustainable , long - term growth we want to see			0
’ a @entity51 spokesman said : ‘ the latest economic forecasts from the @entity102 are yet further proof that our long - term economic plan is working , with the strongest growth of any major advanced economy last year and showing upgrades to @entity29 growth forecasts for 2015 and 2016			2
but the @entity102 are right to say the job is not yet done so we must keep working through the plan that is delivering economic security in an uncertain world economy			0
’ inflation as measured by the @entity140 was last at zero or below between december 1959 and march 1960 , according to the @entity141 .			0

inflation hit 0.3 *%* in january - already the lowest level on record
but in a boost for families the bank chief said inflation would fall to zero
mr @entity12 said prices were unlikely to rise for the the rest of the year
but he said it would be ' extremely foolish ' to slash interest in *response*
