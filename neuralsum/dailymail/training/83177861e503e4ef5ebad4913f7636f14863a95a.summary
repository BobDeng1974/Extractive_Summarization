by @entity0 published : 09:46 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 02:39 est , 10 october 2012 scientists have discovered a keen sense of taste boosts immunity - a breakthrough that could lead to nasal sprays to ward off illness			2
people who find some vegetables , such as sprouts and broccoli , unbearably bitter are better at fighting off bugs due to chemicals in their nose , a study shows			2
experiments found they have more receptors that pick up the flavour of these foods - and also work as an early warning system about bacterial invaders			2
hating sprouts could actually mean you get ill less often , researchers have found			2
they say a third of people have a ' supertaster ' gene that makes sprouts taste bitter - but mean they can fight infection			1
they were traditionally thought to be located only on the tongue but are now known to be in the linings of the nasal and sinus cavities as well			0
and these receptors are involved in activating the body ’s natural defences against common infections			1
however , almost a third of the population do not have the specific version of the bitter taste receptor gene called @entity45 that activates an immune response			1
dr @entity47 , of the @entity48 in the @entity49 , said : ' if you are a supertaster , it is going to be very rare you are going to get sinusitis			0
' but he added this bitter - tasting ability does not protect against all infections			1
the findings , published in the @entity57 , could lead to better treatments for chronic rinosinusitis , a condition of constantly inflamed and swollen sinuses which affects up to one in ten people			0
bitterness is the most sensitive of the tastes , and many find it unpleasant , sharp or disagreeable			0
common bitter foods also include marmalade , olives , citrus peel and wild chicory			1
in the study the researchers grew cells in lab dishes , forming structures that resembled the multilayered lining of the nose and sinus , to test out how bitter receptors affect the initial stages of the infection process			2
chemicals produced by common bacteria called @entity85 activated the @entity45 bitter receptor , and caused the hair - like cilia that line the sinuses to start sweeping away microbial intruders			1
the activation also resulted in the release into the sinuses of nitric oxide which kills bacteria			0
the researchers looked at just one of 25 bitter receptors and it remains to be seen if the others affect the immune system			1
in the past researchers have used phenylthiocarbamide ( @entity103 ) to identify people with functional bitter receptors			0
a bunch of purple sprouting broccoli			0
researchers have found that those who find it unbearably bitter may posses a gene that helps them fight off infection			1
those who can taste the chemical are classified as supertasters , the researchers said people who would say @entity118 sprouts taste bitter are likely to be supertasters , having responsive bitter receptors			1
the study also suggests supertasters may have a higher risk of chronic sinusitis , and that non-tasters have more upper respiratory infections			0
upon testing nasal tissue samples from patients who had undergone surgery related to sinus problems , the researchers found none of the eleven supertasters had @entity134 bacteria in their tissues , whereas seven out of twenty non-tasters had infections			1
dr @entity138 , an expert in taste and smell at the @entity140 , reviewed the research and said it could lead to an almost cost free test to distinguish supertasters from the more susceptible non-tasters			0
he said certain bitter compounds could also be used to activate the immune system			1
for example , a bitter nasal spray could be used to ward off an infection in the early stages			0
but such potential therapies are a long way off			0
dr @entity47 said his researchers will next look at whether genetics plays a role in people ’s responses to sinusitis treatments .			0

bitter taste receptor gene @entity45 found to activate an immune response
can boost the body ’s natural defences against common infections
