by @entity0 published : 17:47 est , 16 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:42 est , 16 february 2014 the @entity3 last night saw an impressive array of leading ladies squeezed into the slinkiest of designer dresses			1
many looked as though they ’d been dieting for months to iron out the creases			2
but , as i ’ve discovered , looks can be deceiving			0
a revolutionary treatment that looks like a cling film body wrap claims to trim or ‘ melt ’ up to six inches of fat from your bottom , hips and tummy within an hour			1
too good to be true ? most possibly			0
but as a busy mother , i ’m up for giving anything a go			0
since having my son @entity21 , six , i ’ve yo - yo ’d from a size 14 back to a ten — my pre-baby size			1
it 's a wrap : @entity0 lost an impressive five inches after her unusual treatment today , i ’m a large size 12 after an over-indulgent winter			1
it makes me unhappy — i have a dressing room full of beautiful dresses i ca n’t wear			0
so , with renewed motivation , i find myself in the hands of @entity33 , a beauty therapist who performs the @entity35 treatment			1
i wince when i hear the price — £ 55 just to be wrapped in cling film ? but it ’s far cheaper than liposuction and i ’m desperate to get into a nice frock for the weekend , plus the treatment is available nationwide in spa and beauty clinics			1
it involves applying an oil - based solution to exfoliated skin , then being wrapped tightly in a heat - inducing cling film - type material for an hour			1
as well as reducing fat , the makers claim it can also improve the look of cellulite and stretchmarks			0
how ? well , apparently the mix of essential oils used in the solution includes juniper , lavender and cypress			0
they aid phosphatidylcholine — a chemical substance that triggers lipolysis , the process of breaking down certain fats from cells so they can be processed by the liver			0
the treatment is popular with women who are looking to get into a tight frock for a special event			1
@entity33 says all her clients have lost at least some fat			1
indeed , one apparently lost an astonishing 14 in after just three treatments			1
it starts with a three - day liver cleanse , where alcohol , caffeine and fatty and processed foods are forbidden			1
one could be forgiven for wondering whether it ’s this diet , rather than the wrap , that gives the ‘ miraculous ’ results			0
@entity85 shocked and amazed everyone earlier this year after losing weight but keeping her curves through a specific exercise programme created by her personal trainer but the theory is that as the liver will need to process the fat released from cells during the treatment , it needs to be in as good a shape as possible			1
the more fat your liver can deal with , the more inches you ’ll lose , i ’m told			0
i also have to up my water intake — according to @entity33 , if i ’m dehydrated , cells could retain fluid , which make it unlikely that i ’ll see any results			0
i have to stick with this strict diet plan for three days after the treatment as the fat loss will continue			1
on the day of the treatment , @entity33 measures 13 points on my body including my upper arms , waist and calves			1
i then lie face - down on the bed while she massages in the oily solution , starting with my legs before moving up to the arms			1
oiled up , it ’s time to wrap			0
i feel a bit like a marinated chicken waiting to be cooked			0
i stand up so @entity33 can wrap me up using her giant roll of film			2
this is said to create a barrier around the treatment area			2
the heat from being wrapped in the film also helps open your pores so the oil is fully absorbed			1
while i look and feel as though i ’ve been wrapped in bog - standard supermarket cling film , the wrap is actually made from a plant - based material			1
it ’s tight , but not uncomfortably so			0
i itch a little , which is normal			0
i can see why this treatment might not be suitable for people who suffer with claustrophobia			2
transformed : @entity143 lost 6 stone in a year and has since released work out dvds and a book i ’m then covered with a light plastic sheet and fluffy duvet			2
it all begins to feel rather relaxing			0
surely sweating out water must be the secret , as with some other wraps ? ‘ no , you might be warm , but i make sure you do n’t sweat			0
in fact , we want you to keep drinking before , during and after the treatment to help your liver , ’ says @entity33			2
true to her word , she checks my temperature throughout and constantly offers me sips of water			0
at the end of the hour , the duvet is peeled back and i ’m cut free from the wrap			2
now it ’s time to be measured again			0
startlingly , i ’ve lost 0.2 in off each calf and my arms , 0.4 in off my waist and 1 in off my hips			1
my tummy and — bizarrely — my right knee have stayed the same , though my left knee has dropped 0.2 in			0
i ’ve lost 0.6 in from each upper thigh , and 0.4 in each for the lower thighs			2
that ’s almost 5 in in total , which is at the upper end of the average loss			0
i ’m elated ! and my skin looks and feels great			0
the trick is to see if the inch loss continues , so i measure myself again 24 , 36 and 60 hours later , trying to be as accurate as possible			2
cling film was invented as a waterproof coating for planes in @entity188 while i expect my measurements to go back to normal virtually immediately , i ’m delighted to find that after 60 hours there is still a difference compared to before the cling film wrap			1
i ’ve still lost 1.2 in off my hips , 0.6 in off my lower thighs and 0.2 in off my upper thighs — a total loss of 2 in			1
a few more days later and those inches still have n’t gone back on			0
i ca n’t help but think this is the perfect quick - fix weight - loss trick , ideal to get into that tight party dress for the weekend			2
not bad for an hour in bed ! for more information , go to @entity202 - eob.co.uk			1
