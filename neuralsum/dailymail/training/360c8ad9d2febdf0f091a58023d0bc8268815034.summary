by @entity0 published : 04:43 est , 30 august 2012 updated : 11:54 est , 30 august 2012 last week , @entity1 was beaten in the courts by @entity3 , and told to pay $ 1billion to its arch - rival after jurors agreed the tech giant had copied the @entity8 design			2
but @entity1 is now ready to fight back , unveiling a raft of new products for @entity11 and @entity12 yesterday that can not be charged with @entity3 's criticism that @entity1 is not innovating			0
first up is a brand new tablet that aims to give the @entity15 a run for its money , boasting a 10.1 - inch screen , the latest version of @entity11 , and a design style that keeps away from @entity3 's iconic look			1
@entity3 's complaint that @entity1 should innovate more seems to have worked - with @entity1 's tablet boasting a re-invention of the stylus			0
what was originally a bulky accessory for early @entity29 smartphones is now a slinky pen with a fine tip , that can be used to write naturally on the tablet 's surface , giving @entity1 a distinctive edge in the market			0
time to take on the @entity15 : @entity1 has unveiled the @entity37 tablet - an @entity11 - running tablet that has received warm reviews however the true innovating device at @entity1 's launch event at the @entity45 conference in @entity46 was the @entity47 , in many ways a traditional high - end point - and - shooter taking 16 - mexapixel images through a 21x optical zoom lens			1
but turn the @entity49 - enabled camera around , and the user is presented with a 4.8 " screen running @entity11 - allowing you to install apps , play games , watch movies , instantly upload images to @entity57 , or perhaps install the @entity59 app to convert your images into old - timey snapshots			1
as you have the full gamut of @entity11 apps to play with , you could edit your images on the fly , install programs like @entity66 to create time - lapse images , or use @entity1 's in - house apps like @entity69 to edit your videos			1
or - when there are no decent snaps to take - you could simply play games such as @entity74 , read e-books and magazine , watch films , or use @entity78 to find your next destination			1
the camera - phone , reborn : @entity1 fights back with innovative products , such as the @entity47 , which debuted in @entity46 yesterday the @entity47 looks like a true camera from the front , but is effectively a phone when you look at the back return of the camera - phone : the large screen helps provide a good preview of your images it 's not the first of the new breed of ' camera - phone ' - @entity93 announced a similar device two weeks ago , but @entity1 's pedigree in mobile is likely to establish this as a credible new type of device			1
games , maps , apps and web : flip it over and you have the full @entity11 experience @entity107 , @entity109 vice president of consumer electronics , said : ' in this new era of visual communication the @entity1 â€™s @entity47 marks a breakthrough in convergence technology , combining the leading edge design of our @entity116 mobile products with high performance photographic capability			1
' while the phone also has a sim card slot to allow you to upload images on the go , there are no signs yet that @entity1 is adding phone - functionality to this camera just yet			1
if the @entity47 is attempting to break the boundaries between phone and camera , the @entity128 is breaking similar ground between phone and tablet			1
the note 2 is effectively the big brother to this year 's flagship @entity139 phone , bringing with it a quad - core phone running the latest version of @entity11 , which for the first time brings @entity78 's software up to the same silky smoothness of @entity3 's @entity8			1
but that 's almost besides the point , for the first thing you will notice about the note is its screen - a pocket - stretching 5.5 " screen which , once held , makes every other phone feel miniature by comparison			2
it 's big , it 's bold and it can be both a phone and a tablet at the same time : the @entity128 has been launched the phone that thinks it 's a tablet : @entity1 vice president presents the new @entity128 in @entity46 bigger than your usual : the @entity128 is the big brother to the @entity139 , and the successor to last year 's note last year 's original note was a surprise success , selling 10 million units for a device which will not be to everyone 's taste			2
the high - definition 16:9 screen is complemented by the @entity173 - a digital stylus allowing you to scribble away on the phone - screen like it was a notepad			1
in the @entity29 days , many smartphones came with a stylus , but @entity1 has redeveloped the technology , replacing the old blocky stub of a tip with a pen - like thin tip which helps create a natural writing feeling			0
the extra-large screen also enables the luxury of running multiple apps at the same time on the @entity128 , similar to how you can have multiple windows open at the same time on a pc			1
for instance you can browse the web while having a pop - up video playing running a movie or tv program at the same time			0
the note 2 will be released in october and available in white and ' titanium blue '			0
@entity1 also launched a new range called ' @entity199 ' - devices which are based on the upcoming @entity12 and @entity202 platforms			0
@entity1 has dipped its toe before into @entity205 software , delivering the @entity207 phone last year , before concentrating on its @entity11 offering			2
this time , it unveiled the @entity209 , a @entity211 dual - core processor with a 4.8 - inch hd super amoled display , all ready to go when @entity202 is officially launched later this year			0
the @entity12 family : @entity1 also launched a new smartphone , a tablet pc and a ' smart pc ' the @entity209 smartphone was unveiled yesterday @entity202 has had a good reception from critics , but has had slow sales , not helped by a much - delayed launch which helped @entity11 and @entity3 take the lion 's share of the market			2
still , with the @entity12 desktop system launching this year , this will probably bring renewed attention to the mobile offering			0
co-existing with the phone are two breeds of laptop / tablet combinations , both running the new operating system , which has been optimised for touch operations			0
the 11.6 - inch @entity234 , and the higher - specced @entity235 , both run on @entity12 , powered by @entity236			0
each features a detachable keyboard - docking system that allows users to easily switch between a clamshell notebook pc and a tablet pc form factor			0
as well as keyboard , mouse and touch - controls , the devices also work with the @entity173 , allowing writing ans scribbling like on the @entity128 .			2
