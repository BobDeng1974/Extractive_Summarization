he added : ' our family has been utterly devastated at losing @entity3 , we have really struggled to come to terms with what has happened			2
' we feel that the treatment @entity3 received at hospital fell well below acceptable standards			1
' you beat yourself up			0
as parents you feel i should have been responsible for her but you trust the doctors			0
' on reflection now this is what we now beat ourselves up about , we think we should have insisted			0
' but at the time you do n’t think you can , we presumed she was on the right side of it and would get better and trusted the doctors			0
@entity41 , 48 is pictured with his wife @entity99 , 52 and their daughter @entity52 , 21 , at their home ' our outlook on life is totally different , that ’s what it does to you			2
they will just carry on and we are left to pick up the pieces			0
' we put our faith into the clinicians that were looking after her in hospital and now we have to live with the guilt of thinking we could have done more to save her life			0
' we have been fighting for justice for @entity3 ever since she died and the settlement from the @entity68 marks the end of a long legal battle			1

' our lives have been turned upside down since 2009 and as a family we no longer celebrate @entity139 as it marks the anniversary of us losing @entity3			1
' we hope that through @entity3 ’s case lessons are learnt by medical staff in recognising when patients need further treatment rather than being sent home in the hope no other family has to go through what we have			2
' medical experts at @entity151 lawyers who represented the family found that @entity3 should not have been discharged on december 21 , 2009			1
@entity41 , 48 is pictured with his wife @entity99 , 52 , have received a payout after their daughter died they discovered the bacterial condition she developed as a complication of a serious episode of glandular fever would have been spotted if she had remained in hospital			1
instead she was allowed home and an overwhelming amount of bacteria entered her bloodstream causing septicaemia which resulted in a rapid deterioration and @entity3 developing multi-organ failure			2
@entity68 maintains their decision to discharge the teenager was correct			0
but medical experts found hospital staff sent @entity3 home despite her parents raising concerns that she was unable to walk because she was so weak			2

' it was just disbelief			0
considering the condition she was in , we did not expect her to go home			0
' she could n’t eat or drink			0
' she had asked if she was going to die just the day before she was let home , that ’s how bad she felt ' mrs @entity3 , @entity195 's mother ' we were concerned she had n’t improved , she had got worse if anything			0
she was dismissed in the morning but we did n’t go home until the evening			0
' i was going to the nurses telling them that the rash was still vibrant and she was having difficulty breathing			0
' she had asked if she was going to die just the day before she was let home , that ’s how bad she felt			0
' ' @entity205 , a medical law and patient ’s rights lawyer at @entity151 , added : ' ever since @entity3 ’s death the family have been desperate for answers about whether more could have been done to save her			0
' they are disappointed that the @entity68 has made no formal admission of liability , despite accepting that if @entity3 had not been discharged , she would have survived			1
' nothing can turn back the clock , but the settlement at the very least , marks the conclusion of the family ’s long legal battle to secure justice for @entity3 ’s memory			2
' we hope that any shortcomings the @entity68 found in its own internal investigation into the treatment given to @entity3 are improved to prevent any future deaths in similar circumstances			1
