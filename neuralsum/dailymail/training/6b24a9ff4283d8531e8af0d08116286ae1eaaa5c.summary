two mothers became embroiled in a bitter @entity2 battle over an invoice handed to one of their sons for missing the other 's birthday party			1
@entity9 and her partner @entity10 were appalled when their son @entity11 , five , arrived home from school with a £ 15.95 bill for missing his classmate @entity15 ’s big day at a local ski centre			1
after refusing to pay , @entity11 's parents were threatened that they would be taken to court			1
since then miss @entity9 and @entity15 's mother @entity18 have become entangled in a war of words			1
the bill was given to the five - year - old via a teacher no show : the parents received this invoice from the mother of the birthday boy - and the ski slope involved said it was nothing to do with them			1
' we do n't have any such things as no - show fees ' , said the manager ' i messaged @entity18 on @entity2 to say sorry and let 's resolve this amicably			1
and she said : " the amicable way i believe is for you to pay me the money			2
and let that be a lesson learnt , ' miss @entity9 , 30 , said			0
' the next thing i heard she was taking us to small claims court			1
my partner went to see her and it ended in an argument			0
she shouted down the street : " do n't mess with me "			2
' every time i spoke to her previously she was always very polite , ' miss @entity9 added			0
' all of this is very shocking			0
' ‘ @entity18 could have tried to contact us before issuing the bill			0
if she had spoken to us we would have considered paying it			0
defence : the host 's mother @entity18 ( left with her family ) said ' all details were on the party invite ' ‘ i could totally understand her point			1
it is not about the money for us and we did not mean to let them down			0
it is the way she has gone about it			0
’ but mrs @entity18 said in a statement : ' all details were on the party invite			1
they had every detail needed to contact me			0
' @entity11 's father however said he had no means of contacting the woman , resorting to trying to find her at the children 's school gates to apologise			1
' my partner looked out for [ mrs @entity18 ] to apologise for @entity11 not showing up to the party , but did n’t see her			2
‘ but on january 15 she looked in @entity11 ’s school bag and found a brown envelope			1
it was an invoice for £ 15.95 for a child ’s party no - show fee			1
’ mr @entity10 said he visited mrs @entity18 ’s home and told her he was ‘ not happy ’			1
he added : ‘ i thought it was a joke to begin with			1
i am lost for words			0
’ he had confirmed @entity11 would attend the ' slide and ride ' party before @entity104 at the @entity105 and @entity106			1
costing £ 15.95 a head , it would have included half an hour on a snow tubing run , three toboggan rides , a hot meal , ice cream , jelly and balloons			0
but he then realised he had already arranged for their daughter to go on a day trip with her grandparents			2
the host 's mother could have little luck getting back the £ 15.95 in court - where the administration fee to make a claim is £ 25			1
the ski centre 's manager @entity125 said : ' it seems to be a dispute between two parents and the parent who wrote the invoice has put us on it , which is crazy because we have nothing to do with it			1
' we ask for a small deposit on booking and 48 hours before the party we ask hosts to confirm numbers and pay us the full amount			1
it 's £ 15.95 a head for a slide and ride party			1
' but there 's no such thing as a no - show fee			1
we do n't invoice private individuals , we just ask for payment 48 hours before			1
' if the child does n't show , to be honest we 're pretty flexible			2
we might give the hosts some extra toboggan rides or some credit at the bar			2
' i understand people being upset because people outlay a lot of money for these parties , so i understand their frustration			0
' whether invoicing another parent is a good idea or not is not for me to say , but it 's certainly not something i 'd do			2
' from @entity9 : hi @entity18			0
this is @entity11 ’s mum			0
i was very shocked to see the invoice in @entity11 ’s school bag			1
the only reason @entity11 did not attend the party was because his nan and grandad were going away for @entity104 and the only day the kids could go see them was on the same day as the party			2
i apologise for not letting you know , but i did not have a phone number or an email for you			0
if i had known that i would have to pay if @entity11 did not go , then i would have paid you the money , no problem			2
i do not like fighting with people , and would prefer to settle this amicably			0
from @entity18 : hi @entity9 , i confirmed with all parents on the thursday before the party that they were going as i had to pay that day , and @entity10 told me @entity11 was looking forward to it and would see us there , to me that is confirmation			1
my phone number was on the invitation that was sent out to @entity11			0
i do n’t like fighting with people either , and was not best impressed when @entity10 turned up on my doorstep , and said you wo n’t get any money out of me , rather rudely			2
the amicable way round this i believe would be to pay me the money and let a lesson be learnt			2
i hope this is agreeable			0
@entity18 tw : the only reason @entity10 was angry was because of the fact that the envelope was put into @entity11 ’s school bag , when it has nothing to do with the school			1
like i said before , no money was mentioned when we spoke , and i feel it would be inappropriate to pay you the money , when i do n’t know what it ’s actually paying for			2
like i said before i did n’t have your number to let you know			0
and exactly what lesson would i be learning			0
i am not a child , so please do not speak to me like i am one			0
so , to answer your question , unfortunately no. this is not agreeable			0
@entity219 : you are paying for 1 x child ’s party at the ski slope including snow tubing and tobogganing and lunch			1
tw : just so you know , small claims court cost £ 60 just to start a claim			1
also i ’m not paying for something we did n’t use			0
@entity219 : it does n’t cost that much tw : it does			0
i do n’t know why you are out for our blood			0
if you had come up to us the first day back and explained about the money , then i could have explained about @entity11 , then maybe we could have sorted something out			0
instead you send an invoice			0
row : mr @entity10 confronted the party host 's mother on the doorstep of her @entity245 home ( pictured ) @entity246 : the home where mr @entity10 lives with his partner @entity9 and their five - year - old son @entity11 bemused : the bill for the no show fee at the ski centre ( left ) and mr @entity10 with his son			1
' i thought it was a joke to begin with , ' he said			2
' i told her i would not be paying her the money			0
she should have spoken to me first ' family attraction : the ' slide and ride ' party at the ski centre in @entity263 would have included ' snow tubing ' , three toboggan rides per child and a hot meal with a pudding of jelly and ice cream			2

@entity271 missed ski slope party and went to see grandparents instead
weeks later his shocked father @entity10 found ' no show fee ' in school bag
it had been put there after being handed to a teacher by the boy 's mother
mr @entity10 , 45 , from @entity285 , @entity245 , said : ' i thought it was a joke '
he refused to pay - and ' has been threatened with small claims court '
@entity105 and @entity106 : we did n't write the invoice
manager said boy 's mother could have had credit on the bar instead
but *unrepentant* mother said : ' all details were on the party invite '
