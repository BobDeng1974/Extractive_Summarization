by @entity0 published : 09:57 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 12:33 est , 5 november 2013 on the 26th july 1937 , @entity1 was doing what she loved best			2
a noted photographer , she was busy documenting the progress of the bloody @entity5			2
but tragedy was about to catch up with her			0
as @entity11 forces retreated in the face of an aerial bombardment , the car in which she was travelling was rammed by an out - of - control tank			0
critically injured , @entity15 died the next day aged just 26 years old			2
after @entity15 's death , a legend grew up around her but her work was often overshadowed by that of her former lover : war photographer @entity21			1
now a new book looks set to change all that			0
tragic : @entity1 ( pictured with @entity21 ) was killed aged 26 during the @entity24 book : @entity27 's new book suggests that @entity15 was responsible for work published under @entity21 's name @entity1 : inventing @entity21 tells the story of their ill - fated love affair and also illuminates their working relationship			1
in 2007 , a suitcase was discovered in @entity36 that contained hundreds of negatives belonging to @entity15 , including many that had previously been attributed to @entity21			1
now author @entity40 aims to shed light on @entity15 's extraordinary life and reveal the extent to which @entity15 influenced @entity21 , who went on to become one of the most famous photojournalists of his generation			1
' her early death , the overshadowing of the @entity5 by the @entity49 , and her connection with communism all contributes to her obscurity , ' writes @entity27 in the book			2
' the rediscovery of @entity15 's photographs opens the door to more than just an insight into the brief career of a talented photojournalist			2
it allows us to re-examine the story of @entity1 herself and the partnership that so defined her			2
' behind the melodramatic newspaper tale of the heroic girl reporter tragically killed in action lies a highly complex reality , a fascinating story of image and identity , love and loss in which little is as it first appears			0
' portrait of a young photographer : @entity1 pictured in @entity78 in 1935 , the year she met @entity21 devastated : @entity21 was eaten up with guilt after @entity15 's death during the @entity24 hellish : half a million people were killed during the @entity5 which raged between 1936 and 1939 @entity21 was born @entity21 on the 22nd october 1913 in @entity83			1
after moving to @entity78 in 1933 and meeting @entity1 , he adopted the name @entity21 and made his name documenting the @entity5			1
following the death of @entity15 and the end of the war , he moved to @entity89 but was soon back in @entity90 , covering the battles of @entity49 , @entity92 among them			2
later , he would document the aftermath of the @entity95 campaign in @entity96 and the early years of @entity97 following independence in 1937 , all while finding time to romance actress @entity99 , although he never married			0
his death , when it came , was remarkably similar to @entity15 's			0
embedded with the @entity103 army during the @entity104 , in may 1954 , @entity21 was travelling through northern @entity105 when he left the convoy that he was accompanying to go ahead and photograph the advance			0
according to those with him , the explosion that killed him came just five minutes later			0
@entity21 had stepped on a landmine			0
he died hours later in hospital at just 40 years old			0
and what a tale it is			0
@entity15 was born in 1910 to a family of @entity95 - @entity116 jews in the city of @entity118			1
known then as @entity1 , her early life was uneventful			0
but after @entity122 and the @entity123 came to power , life became increasingly difficult for the @entity1 family and in 1933 , @entity15 was arrested for distributing anti-fascist pamphlets			1
forced out of @entity95 following her release in 1934 , @entity15 would never see her family again			1
in 1935 , a year after moving to @entity78 , @entity15 met @entity116 photojournalist @entity21 and fell in love			1
renaming themselves @entity1 and @entity21 , the pair worked together to document the rise of the @entity134 in @entity103 , selling their photos under @entity21 's name			1
but their @entity103 idyll was not to last			0
in 1936 , civil war broke out in @entity141 and @entity15 and @entity142 travelled to @entity143			1
together , they covered the war in @entity146 and @entity147 , still publishing all the images under @entity21 's name			0
by mid 1937 , @entity15 had left @entity21 and was producing work under her own name , including iconic images of the bombing in @entity154			1
sadly , @entity15 would n't have the chance to create many more			0
after her death while covering the @entity24 in july 1937 , @entity15 's work was largely forgotten and her reputation overshadowed by that of @entity21			1
iconic : @entity21 later became one of the world 's top war photographers and took this shot of the @entity92 landings but with the discovery of the ' @entity36 suitcase ' and the news that two films about her life are in the offing , @entity15 may not be overlooked for much longer			1
brave , beautiful and the inspiration for the hundreds of female war correspondents who have followed in her footsteps , as @entity27 's book makes clear , it 's time to reassess the legacy of the first female photographer to fall in battle			0
@entity1 : inventing @entity21 by @entity27 , £ 35 , is published by @entity183			2

@entity1 , a @entity95 - @entity116 jew , was born in @entity118 in 1910
