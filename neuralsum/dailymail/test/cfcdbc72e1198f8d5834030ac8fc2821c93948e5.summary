asked whether he had lost his temper , mr @entity0 told the @entity35 : ' i was very calm about it			2
i did n't lose my rag			0
' he said his protest had been sparked by the hostile audience reaction to his argument that high levels of immigration were increasing pressure on the housing market , something he said would be accepted by ' most rational people '			1
and he added : ' this is not the first time i 've seen this			0
the night of the by - election that @entity52 won in @entity54 with a landslide , there was a @entity8 representative - @entity57 - on @entity58 in @entity54 and the audience were deeply hostile to him			1
' asked if he blamed the @entity19 , mr @entity0 said : ' sometimes these things go wrong , sometimes you get groups who apply to be on programmes who perhaps are n't as truthful on their applications as they could be			1
' in this case , the @entity19 gave the job to a polling company called @entity17 who are famous for getting everything about @entity8 wrong and that i think was the mistake			1
' am i going to make a complaint ? i 've got an election to fight			0
what matters is n't the 200 people in the room , what really matters are the millions of people watching on television			0
' mr @entity0 's outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching independent pollsters @entity17 were hired by the @entity19 to select the audience of around 250 people			1
after facing stiff criticism from @entity8 , the firm today released a statement on how it chose the audience members			1
they were selected from a 20 - mile radius of the venue in @entity11			0
the region was broken up into 30 small areas , and at least 8 people were chosen from each area			0
each person was selected to reflect the ' composition of the @entity15 population by gender , age , ethnicity , and social grade , and political protocols that reflected the balance as agreed between the broadcasters and the political parties ' , @entity17 said			0
a fifth of the people declared themselves to be ' undecided voters '			0
a ' small number ' of @entity119 and @entity121 supporters were brought in from @entity122 and @entity123			0
@entity17 added : ' the recruitment approach replicated those used by @entity17 at all the 2010 leader debates , both the @entity127 vs @entity0 debates last year , and the recent @entity129 debate			1
' mr @entity0 was widely considered to have won the debates against @entity127 last year , after which the @entity8 leader made no complaint about the audience composition			1
last night saw five opposition party leaders go head - to - head in a 90 - minute live tv debate			2
mr @entity0 appeared alongside @entity139 's @entity138 , @entity119 leader @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity121 's @entity142			2
during the earlier exchanges , the leaders on mr @entity0 for his anti-immigration policies , attracting applause from the audience			2
mr @entity0 was taken aback , and attacked a ' total lack of comprehension ' from those watching and protested they were ' a remarkable audience even by the left - wing standards of the @entity19 '			1
his outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching			1
mr @entity0 warned that foreigners arriving in the @entity15 ' has directly contributed to the housing crisis '			2
but he came under fire for linking all of the countries problems to immigration			0
@entity168 leader @entity167 took a swipe at mr @entity0 : ' there is someone here on this platform who wants to totally demonise migrants and you know who i mean			2
' she hit back at claims migrants are causing a crisis in the health service : ' one in four doctors is foreign born , 40 per cent of @entity185 staff are foreign born			0
mr @entity138 said told mr @entity0 : ' you abuse immigrants and those with @entity189 and then you complain that @entity8 is being abused			1
' miss @entity140 won loud applause as she urged mr @entity0 to ' put the bogeyman to one side '			0
she told him : ' we have a housing crisis across this country			0
you know what , @entity0 ? it is n't caused by immigrants			0
in your world every problem is caused by immigrants			0
' but mr @entity0 claimed the audience was biased against him : ' there just seems to be a total lack of comprehension on this panel , and indeed amongst this audience , which is a remarkable audience even by the left - wing standards of the @entity19			1
' mr @entity0 was heckled by members of the audience before @entity214 , who was presenting the broadcast on @entity216 , intervened to say : ' @entity0 , let me just say one thing			1
' this is an audience that has been carefully chosen not by the @entity19 , but by an independent polling organisation to represent the balance between all parties			1
' labour leader @entity138 gave the @entity8 leader the advice : ' it 's never a great idea to attack the audience , @entity0 , in my opinion			1
' but mr @entity0 retorted : ' the real audience are sitting at home			2
' explanation : mr @entity0 was heckled before @entity214 ( pictured ) , who was presenting the broadcast on @entity216 , intervened to say how the audience had been chosen the @entity19 insists the audience was carefully selected by an independent pollster , but mr @entity0 said something had gone ' wrong ' with the process unimpressed : @entity8 voter @entity238 , 44 a @entity8 voter has insisted he is having second thoughts about backing the party after @entity0 attacked the studio audience			1
security worker @entity238 , 44 , of @entity243 , south - east @entity26 , believed the @entity8 leader had ' done a couple of stupid things '			1
the first was his comment on the audience and the second was raising his views on people with @entity189 visiting the @entity15 for @entity185 treatment , mr @entity238 said			0
asked if mr @entity0 's remarks had put him off supporting @entity8 , mr @entity238 said : ' it did a bit , yeah			1
i do n't think he put himself across right			0
' if we 're just talking about the debate tonight - it 's what we should be talking about , not what he 's done six years ago or two years ago or yesterday - for me , @entity140 was the best			0
' she was slick , she was well prepared , she had been well briefed , that 's my personal opinion			0
@entity138 - it was like he was reading off a script			0
' the @entity19 insisted the audience had been chosen by an independent polling organisation to reflect the supporters of all parties - not just those represented by their leaders last night			1
a spokesman for the corporation told @entity274 yesterday : ' @entity17 recruited an audience to give a cross section of political opinion			0
' @entity17 , a public opinion research company founded in 1989 , was unavailable for comment last night			0
@entity8 meanwhile was said to be pressing for an inquiry into how the audience was chosen			2
asked after the debate about mr @entity0 's criticism of the audience , @entity8 deputy leader @entity282 said : ' i am not sure whether we will complain			1
all i will say is i did n't think the audience was representative of the views of @entity15 people			0
' i think @entity0 would have done very well with people sitting at home			0
' mr @entity282 said he had spoken about things which had happened to him on @entity58 , telling reporters : ' who knows , may be some people are being disingenuous on their application forms			0
' asked if adopting an attack on the audience was an easy get out clause for dismissing opposition to @entity8 's views , he added : ' oh no. people at home agree with us and that 's what really matters - the millions of people at home watching this			1
' we know , for example , on immigration , on the @entity312 they agree with where @entity8 stands			2
what the audience in here really think is , i suppose , irrelevant			0
' tweeting during the debate , lord @entity320 said : ' a minority view once again			0
@entity0 having a go at the @entity19 audience may well appeal to the viewers whose vote he is targeting			1
' and @entity328 presenter @entity327 tweeted : ' @entity0 having a pop at balance of audience			2
broadcasters jump through hoops to make sure studio is fair			0
' as the end credits rolled following the @entity19 debate last night , four of the five party leaders shook hands with each other - but mr @entity0 just drank from a glass of water from behind his stand			1
as miss @entity167 and miss @entity142 walked away , miss @entity140 then went to shake mr @entity0 's hand - and mr @entity138 offered the @entity8 leader a pat on the back			1
then , all of the leaders went to the audience to shake their hands - with the exception , again , of mr @entity0			2
he shook hands with mr @entity214 before leaving without going up to the audience			2
