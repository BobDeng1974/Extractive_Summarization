by @entity0 published : 10:05 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 11:10 est , 25 june 2012 long - time @entity2 rivals @entity3 and @entity4 are working together to develop next - generation tv panels called oleds in a reversal of decades of rivalry as they try to catch up with @entity10 's @entity9			1
the companies said in a joint statement monday they will share core technologies to develop @entity6 , or organic light - emitting diode , panels			1
