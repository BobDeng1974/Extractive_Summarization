by @entity0 @entity1 know they have to be sharp mentally and physically if they are going to avoid becoming the second team to be upset by @entity5 at the @entity6			1
@entity7 fell victim to the @entity10 nation in their opening @entity12 game and now the @entity14 will play @entity5 on friday at the hottest time of the day in @entity16			1
' you have to face them prepared to play to the death because everyone would have predicted a victory for @entity7 , ' @entity1 midfielder @entity17 told the @entity14 media			1
@entity24 : @entity1 wary : @entity17 has described the @entity5 fixture as @entity1 's ' most dangerous game ' at the @entity6 threat : @entity29 's @entity28 scored for @entity5 as they shocked @entity7 in their first game ' i remember we played there ( in @entity16 ) last year in the @entity34 against @entity35 ( @entity1 won 4 - 3 in the quarter - finals ) , and we suffered from the heat as well as @entity35 's speed			1
' the game against @entity5 is seen as the most dangerous game , because we play at 1pm local time and it will be really difficult			2
' @entity1 are level with @entity5 on three points after opening their campaign with a 2 - 1 win over @entity47 on saturday			1
' can we beat @entity5 ? ' @entity17 said			2
' there is no longer a @entity6 as it once was , like in @entity49 when games ended 8 - 0			0
' we find teams are organised , with strong players and you can not afford to think that @entity1 will beat @entity5 just because we are called @entity1			1
' the heat and humidity are a major concern for the @entity1 , so much so that @entity1 's team doctor , @entity57 , wants @entity58 to allow time - outs for players so they can drink water in their next two encounters , which both kick off at 1pm local time			1
players were not allowed drinks breaks during saturday 's game			0
concerned : @entity1 team doctor @entity67 says @entity58 should allow water breaks during the game sweaty : not only are temperatures expected to be high but humidity could be a factor on friday in @entity16 @entity74 : @entity16 ' it would have been good to have had a three - minute time - out during that game , ' @entity57 said			1
' fortunately , we prepared well and none of our players had cramps			0
' i hope that in @entity16 and @entity83 ( the cities where @entity1 will play their next two games ) , where the conditions will be no better than in @entity87 because of the times the games are scheduled for , @entity58 will reconsider			0
' the criteria is that if the temperature is 32 degrees @entity93 or above then the time - out is almost automatic			0
' however , what they do n't consider is that with humidity above 70 to 80 per cent , it feels three or four degrees warmer			0
missing : veteran keeper @entity98 will be absent again when @entity1 face the @entity12 minnows ' with those conditions and in these type of games , one can lose two litres of sweat			2
' @entity1 trained on monday at their base camp in @entity106 without several players , including @entity17			2
@entity17 sat out the morning session with neck pain while defender @entity110 trained separately from the group with a minor muscular problem			0
@entity114 goalkeeper @entity98 and @entity115 defender @entity113 , who watched the game against @entity47 from the stands , were also absent with the former out with an ankle injury and the latter sidelined with a calf strain .			0

@entity17 warns against *complacency* as @entity1 take on minnows
@entity1 take on @entity5 on friday , in a lunch - time kick - off ( @entity127 time )
@entity5 stunned @entity7 on saturday to *top* @entity12
humidity likely to be a *big* factor in second group game
@entity1 team doctor wants water breaks for players
