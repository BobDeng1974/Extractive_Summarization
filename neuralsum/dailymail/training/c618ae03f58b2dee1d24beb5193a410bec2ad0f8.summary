by @entity0 published : 22:55 est , 1 december 2012 updated : 01:07 est , 2 december 2012 after weeks on the run from authorities in @entity4 , has multi millionaire software developer @entity1 , 67 , finally been captured ? a posting on the anti-computer - virus pioneer 's own blog suggests that indeed he has - which if it proves to be true will end an increasingly bizarre saga that has lasted almost a month			1
wanted by police in the @entity13 country for questioning regarding his neighbour 's murder , @entity10 was updated on saturday afternoon with an ' unconfirmed report that @entity1 has been captured at the border of @entity4 and @entity19			1
' scroll down for @entity20 multi-millionaire software developer @entity1 appeared on @entity21 for an interview on friday and his blog was updated claiming ' unconfirmed reports ' he had been arrest on saturday @entity1 has frequently used the blog to keep the world updated on his weird and wonderful attempts to evade captured in @entity4 , which have included dressing in outlandish disguises and swapping cell phones over to avoid satellite detection			1
he has in the past claimed that there exists enough material to keep the blog going for a year and has also stated that should anything happen to him a man named @entity39 would be put in charge of posting information - and it seems that day has come			2
in @entity4 , a source at the @entity44 embassy speaking anonymously to reporters said that friends of @entity1 denied he had been captured and that they and the police had no information on a possible arrest			1
if the outlaw software developer has been apprehended it comes directly after an interview with @entity21 , in which he claimed his life was in danger and that he had tired of life on the run , which he has been since his neighbour , @entity58 , was discovered with a bullet in his head on november 11th			1
anti-virus software pioneer @entity1 at the @entity62 in may of this year for an interview in the brief talk with a @entity21 reporter , @entity1 said , ' i will certainly not turn myself in , and i will certainly not quit fighting			1
i will not stop my blog			0
' claiming that he will either be arrested or get away , clarifying ' get away does n't mean leave the country			0
it means they will , @entity72 , find the murderer of mr. @entity58 and , @entity74 , the people of this country - who are by and large terrified to speak out - start speaking out			1
' @entity1 and @entity58 repeatedly had run - ins with each other the dogs that the multi-millionaire owned and in one interview with @entity82 claimed that the killers of mr. @entity58 were looking for him in fact and not his unfortunate neighbour			1
in fact , the last six months have proven to be one odd episode after another for @entity1 , which began in may when his home was raided and police said they found multiple firearms and the 67 - year - old living with a 17 - year - old girl			1
the @entity21 report also noted that police in @entity4 have said they do n't consider @entity1 a suspect in the killing ; they say they only want him for questioning			2
and yesterday , the ecentric fugitive millionaire software mogul , dropped the f - bomb on live television friday while explaining his dislike for local politicians			2

@entity1 was in the midst of recounting an incident earlier this month in which 42 armed @entity4 officers allegedly stormed his compound , arrested him and detained him for 14 hours with no food or water , and then let him go without charges			2
when @entity108 reporter , @entity125 , asked @entity1 why he thought the police had done that , he said it was because he ‘ does not play by the rules			2
’ @entity1 said that he has donated millions of dollars to the local economy , including police departments and homeless agencies , but not through the @entity4 government itself			2
‘ i do n’t do it by giving to the government and letting them dole it out because if i give $ 5 million to the government , $ 10,000 goes to the people and $ 4 million plus change goes into the pockets of the politicians , ’ he said			0
‘ i give directly to the people			0
and i have been doing this all along			0
’ @entity1 , founder of the anti-virus software company that bears his last name , said he has been hiding out in the jungles if @entity4 and wearing disguises in public when he needs to purchase supplies			1

two days before @entity58 's body was discovered , four of @entity1 's dogs were poisoned to death , making @entity1 a ' person of interest , ' @entity4 authorities have said			1
@entity1 says he is innocent and that he will not turn himself in			2
he has said on several occasions that he will be killed if he is taken into custody			0
he has also said the he was set up by the @entity4 government and that it all goes back to a bribe he did n't pay to a politician			0
but he is certainly not shying away from reporters while hiding out			0
over the past three weeks he has given multiple media appearances , including two interviews with @entity108 , an interview with @entity182 , an interview with @entity184 , and an interview with @entity82			0
he also set up a blog , where he details his jungle adventures , his ongoing claims of government corruption , his thoughts about the highly addictive drug bath salts , and his own personal investigation into @entity58 ’s murder			1
a few days after the news of his hiding made headlines , @entity1 logged onto the @entity198 to seek technical support on how phone tracking works , @entity194 reported			2
