truly , it is a terrifying development			0
the great religious fissure between @entity2 and @entity3 that dominates the @entity4 has erupted into open conflict in @entity6 , the region ’s poorest country , threatening to engulf the entire area in a wider war			1
in a dramatic escalation of the stakes , a @entity2 coalition of @entity12 states led by @entity13 launched airstrikes against @entity19 - backed @entity18 rebels who have swept south through the country			1
as @entity6 veered towards political disintegration , the conflict exploded into a region - wide crisis that could have far - reaching and unpredictable international consequences			2
but the far more pressing concern is whether we are now seeing a proxy war in @entity6 between its neighbour @entity13 , the leading @entity2 power , and @entity19 , the leading @entity18 power , explode into a regional conflict that could sweep us all up in its wake			1
@entity13 warplanes targeted @entity18 positions in the country ’s capital @entity51 killing 18 civilians and injuring many more			1
@entity53 and @entity54 supported the @entity13 - led military intervention in @entity6 as the coalition deployed 100 fighter jets and amassed 150,000 soldiers to fight in the region			1
another nine @entity2 states joined the offensive , including the @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , pledging to send aircraft to bomb targets , with @entity67 deploying ships			0
anticipating the worsening situation , @entity53 elite soldiers — in @entity6 to train government troops to fight @entity72 , which has established its most dangerous branch in the country — pulled out last friday			1
this followed a decision by the @entity77			0
@entity78 to evacuate their remaining military personnel as the country teetered on the brink of civil war between the internationally recognised government of president @entity84 and the @entity18 rebels			1
as @entity88 forces left , the rebels — trained , armed and funded by @entity19 — made further advances in the south of the country			2
the @entity6 president , who is backed by the @entity93 , was forced to flee his palace in the former @entity53 colonial port of @entity96 on the southern coast and there were reports last night that he had left by boat for the @entity13 capital , @entity102			1
this week , @entity96 — once one of the @entity105 ’s most important ports for ships heading to imperial @entity107 , and a haven of stability patrolled by officers in pith helmets and colonial shorts — was raked with the sound of gunfire			0
just 35 miles to the north , @entity18 rebels had seized @entity118 air base , which until recently had been used by @entity54 counter-terrorism forces to fight terrorists			1
@entity6 sits on the extreme end of the @entity122 , with @entity13 to the north — where the 150,000 @entity13 troops are now amassing on its border			2
an armed member of @entity18 militia stands over the rubble of houses which were allegedly destroyed by a @entity13 air strike in @entity29 , @entity6 a fierce , tribal society , @entity6 has long been torn apart by tribal conflicts			1
governing the country has been compared with dancing on the heads of snakes			0
the @entity135 — who belong to a relatively obscure branch of @entity3 — were largely confined to the north of the country and were contained by the country ’s longtime president , @entity140 , a wily @entity12 strongman , until he was overthrown in the course of the @entity143 in 2011			0
president @entity84 , his weaker successor , never managed to reassert central control , and in september the @entity135 took control of the capital @entity51			0
in the vacuum created by president @entity84 ’s weak leadership , @entity19 saw the opportunity to taunt its old rival by backing the @entity135 and establishing its influence in the @entity13 ’ backyard			2
but the recent @entity18 advances have proved too much for @entity13 , whose primary aim is to re-establish order in @entity6			1
it amassed a formidable coalition — @entity67 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity62 , @entity64 , @entity63 and @entity67 — of @entity2 - led states and sent in its fighter jets to send a powerful message to @entity19 : stop meddling in @entity12 affairs			1
the @entity13 also regard @entity19 ’s influence in @entity6 as evidence of a much larger drive by @entity19 for regional dominance			2
they claim that @entity19 is using armed proxies to take over other states			0
nothing happens in @entity176 , for instance , without the approval of the @entity179 - backed @entity18 militia @entity178 , which also provides @entity181 ’s beleaguered president @entity180 with his light infantry			1
@entity18 fighters manning a heavy machine gun fixed on the back of a pick - up guard a rally protesting @entity13 - led airstrikes for its part , @entity19 has condemned the air strikes			1
@entity193 spokeswoman @entity192 said the country ‘ considers this action a dangerous step ’ , adding that military action would complicate and worsen the crisis in @entity6			2
‘ this invasion will bear no result but expansion of terrorism and extremism throughout the whole region , ’ she said			0
and the truth is that she may well be right			0
@entity6 has a chronic terrorism problem , simply because such a failed state is an ideal operating ground for terrorists			0
@entity6 is not only home to the most tactically lethal branch of @entity72 but now @entity212 has a foothold there too			0
on march 20 four @entity212 suicide bombers killed 137 @entity18 outside their mosques in @entity51			2
before the @entity54 military moved out of the country , they were allowed to launch drone strikes on @entity72			0
but now , in their absence , terrorists are no longer being targeted so effectively , and will only flourish as a result			0
to make matters still more precarious for the @entity223 in its fight against terror , @entity19 and the @entity18 militias it backs are proving an increasingly vital component of the ground war against @entity212 in @entity230 , with @entity179 commanders directing them and supplying them too			2
this means the @entity223 is walking on diplomatic eggshells			0
what if @entity19 took over much of @entity230 , whose government and population is largely @entity18 as well ? would the @entity13 stand for that ? and if a @entity18 government succeeds in @entity6 , then would n’t @entity13 ’s own downtrodden @entity18 population , some 10 - 15 per cent of them in the kingdom ’s oil - rich @entity244 , want some independence ? the western response to this chaos is understandably hesitant			1
@entity250 is unsure whether @entity179 strategy is really to establish proxy @entity18 governments all over the region or simply to use the @entity18 in @entity6 to taunt @entity13 and pacify the country ’s own hardliners			1
we now have a bizarre — and potentially very dangerous — situation in which @entity54 warplanes are providing air cover for @entity179 - backed militias in @entity230 in a joint effort against @entity212 , while 1,200 miles to the south in @entity6 , the @entity54 are helping @entity13 pilots bomb @entity18 insurgents supported by @entity19			1
so the @entity54 is bombing @entity19 ’s enemies in one country , while helping to bomb its allies in another			2
on top of all this , @entity54 and @entity179 diplomats are resuming their talks about how to restrain @entity274 ’s nuclear programme			0
such is the chaotic and complex nature of affairs in the @entity4			0
and as the @entity13 pledge to resolve their own local difficulty , we can only hold our breath .			0
