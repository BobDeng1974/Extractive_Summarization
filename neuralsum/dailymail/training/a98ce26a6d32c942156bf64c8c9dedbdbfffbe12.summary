by @entity0 there ’s a lot of stress involved in a wedding – choosing a venue , preparing speeches , the politics of who ’s on which table … the list goes on			2
so the pressure and worry felt by one couple who tied the knot on saturday can only be imagined – because they had all the usual wedding worries , plus the fact that their big day was a musical , filmed for national television			1
the stars are grooms @entity20 and @entity22 , who became husband and husband for @entity27 ’s our gay wedding : the musical , on saturday , when gay marriage became legal in @entity30 and @entity31			1
and @entity32 was there on the big day			1
so they had just seven weeks to write all the music and lyrics , rehearse 15 musicians and 30 soloists and record cameos from the likes of @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			1
plus , they had the mindboggling pressure of having to declare their declarations without a single mistake , for legal reasons , while the cameras were running – and sing their vows to each other as - live in front of their friends , relatives and several celebrities			2
despite both being brilliant performers and composers , with mr @entity20 having penned musicals for national tv before , and mr @entity22 being a seasoned @entity85 performer – tempers inevitably frayed on the run - up to the big day			2
here come the grooms : @entity22 and @entity20 ( left ) after becoming mr and @entity22 , with celebrity guest @entity89 pictured right on song : our gay wedding : the musical features friends and family of the grooms - and many of them are established professional singers speedy : the musical was written by mr @entity20 and mr @entity22 in just seven weeks mr @entity20 , 39 , told @entity32 : ‘ it was mayhem			1
i slammed a door a day			2
i threw my headphones across the room on countless occasions			0
seven weeks all in to write , record , recruit , perform , film and organise a wedding			0
but also the luckiest men alive ! ’ in the end , the big day went incredibly smoothly – and @entity32 had a ringside seat , because the author of this article has known mr @entity20 for over two decades and was a guest at the ceremony in a @entity122 theatre inside @entity124 ’s @entity123			1
he also has a very small part to play in the video involving a sausage and an egg ... the experience was an emotional rollercoaster – and will make for a highly entertaining slice of tv			1
guest @entity89 described it as ' fantastic '			1
but we 've a feeling that thousands of others will think the same after it 's aired			1
mums are the word : @entity139 and mr @entity22 's mother , @entity42 , sing a very moving duet in the musical highlights include the grooms being walked up to the aisle while the feeling sing a beautiful arrangement of @entity148 ’ @entity149 only knows , a rendition of respect by @entity153 ’s @entity152 – who was in fine voice – and a touching duet featuring the grooms ’ mothers , about how they felt when their sons came out			1
when that was played back to the 200 guests at the ceremony , there was n’t a dry eye in the @entity164 bubbled up with equal force when the vows were sung , too			1
this is the part where the happy couple reach into their hearts and express their undying love for each other in their own words			0
@entity174 : @entity27 news anchor @entity62 gets in on the act hair we go : @entity179 and actor @entity178 is one of the performers mover and shaker : choreographer @entity183 gives the guests some instructions respect is due : @entity152 from 1980s band @entity153 , pictured here with his partner @entity188 , performed an arrangement of one of his hits happy days : mr till with smiling guests ( from left to right ) @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 at the reception @entity200 mr till on the figures involved : 120 hours in the recording studio three weeks of solid writing starting at 8am and finishing at 2am in the morning one day off in seven weeks ( for the stag do ) 200 guests all of whom need to learn two numbers 150 members of the @entity208 30 soloists 15 musicians it was an emotional high point that left the grooms struggling to keep their voices steady			1
mr @entity22 said afterwards : ‘ when we sung our vows to each other , i ’m not quite sure how either of us held it together			1
we just held on to each other ’s hands for dear life and looked into each other ’s eyes			0
it was the most intense thing			0
it was like the world was n’t there at that point , that we were the only two people there			0
’ mr @entity20 said : ‘ listening to @entity22 ’s vows for the first time , i was in such shock at how beautiful it sounded			0
also because it was orchestrated by @entity231 [ @entity232 ] , a very close friend , so i could hear her voice in the background as well			0
’ possibly the most intense moment for the grooms , however , was actually the part when they had to speak			2
by law , the declarations of intent , when the couple say their full names and solemnly swear to stand by their other half , have to be spoken			0
if either mr @entity20 or mr @entity22 had gone wrong – even if they were unclear - the registrar would have had to correct them and that would have formed part of the show			0
you ’ll have to tune in on monday to see how that scene went			0
some , however , wo n’t be tuning in to our gay wedding : the musical – because they appear to have written it off before it ’s even aired			2
what pressure ? @entity200 @entity22 looks composed and relaxed during his performance flamboyant : the musical is a colourful celebration of gay rights the feeling 's @entity264 sings the grooms up the aisle for an event he believes is very significant			1
he said : ' it ’s very significant for many reasons			0
being a gay man , it means that i ’m now on a level footing with other people in society who want to represent and show their love for another human being and for it to be recognised in the same way , by all kinds of different groups , by the tradition of marriage			0
‘ i think it ’s important for marriage , as well , because i think , to flip it on its head , i believe that marriage needs us gays as much as much as we need marriage			0
without this constant evolution of traditions , they kind of lose their footings and become pointless			0
so it ’s a great thing for marriage as well as being a great thing for gay rights ' one @entity301 reader said ‘ i ca n't believe @entity61 is hosting what is likely to be car crash tv ’ and another commented : ‘ i was hoping for some gravitas on this one off , ground - breaking , historic moment [ gay marriage being legalised ]			1
’ the show does in fact have its serious moments , with @entity152 singing to a backdrop of facts and figures about how laws that repressed homosexuals have gradually been rolled back over the years			0
@entity316 described that moment afterwards as ‘ almost overwhelming ’			0
mr @entity20 just hopes that people give it a chance			0
he said : ‘ this is a dignified , political piece			0
anyone who would attempt to judge it before seeing it , simply does n't understand the importance of music and that 's not a debate i can even enter into			2
' this is a musical about march 29 , which just happens to feature our wedding			2
it 's a political piece as much as it 's a piece about celebration			2
it 's also a piece about hope			2
if , in the @entity340 , we can go , in 50 years , from being second class citizens who were blackmailed and often sent to jail , to being people who are able to get married on tv , then there 's hope for teenagers in @entity347 , @entity348 , @entity349 ... ’ it ’s also a musical that features incredibly catchy songs			1
afterwards , @entity352 , the show ’s commissioning editor , told @entity32 that he ’s been waking up with the tunes in his head and walking down the street humming them			1
and director @entity358 added : ‘ @entity20 ? that boy can write a song			0
’ our gay wedding : the musical airs on monday march 31 at 10pm on @entity27			1
smiles better : chorus member @entity365 , left , and @entity366 , @entity20 's brother , who was the musical 's waistcoated ' mc ' frying game : this particular scene features the article 's author - expressing his desire not to be in a musical			1

we watched as two @entity340 grooms tied the knot at a musical ceremony
the event was filmed for @entity27 and is almost entirely sung
it 's hosted by @entity61 and features numerous celebrity cameos
