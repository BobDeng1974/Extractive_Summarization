by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 21:02 est , 28 october 2012 updated : 21:02 est , 28 october 2012 long overdue : the new review launched into prison privileges will be the first in 13 years outrageous prisoner perks look likely to be axed in a shake - up of cushy jail rules			1
a full review – the first for more than a decade – will examine the lax regimes which allow inmates to lounge in their cells all day , watching daytime tv or playing video games			1
prisons minister @entity15 told the @entity16 he was worried too many inmates were routinely handed ‘ privileges ’ they should have to earn through good behaviour and hard work			1
he said : ‘ i want to ensure that the public have confidence in the prison system			2
' it is crucial that they are assured that any privileges earned in prison are gained through hard work and appropriate behaviour			1
’ ‘ i am looking closely at the policy around the incentives scheme for prisoners , which has not been fully reviewed since 1999			2
‘ there may be clear and important operational reasons for this policy but i want to be clear that these incentives are pitched at the right level and that they have credibility with the public			0
’ currently , prisoners enter jail on a ‘ standard ’ regime , which automatically gives them certain entitlements , including in - cell television			0
they are only bumped down to the basic regime if they step out of @entity48 prison devises its own scheme for how privileges are handed out			2
inmates can ‘ earn ’ entitlements to in - cell television , more visits , higher pay when they work , the right to wear their own clothes and access to their own money			0
inmates are offered a string of digital channels , including @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 – a music channel – and @entity71			0
prisons that are run by private companies , of which there are 11 in @entity75 and @entity76 , may provide @entity77 in prisoners ’ cells			1
some 4,000 convicts are understood to enjoy the perk			2
privileged prisoners : inmates at @entity84 in @entity85 posted this shirtless picture on @entity87 in june , shamelessly defying a ban on phones in prison one option under consideration would be to start inmates on basic and force them to work for extra perks			1
place of punishment : @entity97 wants to make prisons tough again the move marks a break from mr @entity15 ’s disastrous predecessor @entity101 who was pilloried over his decision to allow taxpayer - funded prisoner parties and comedy workshops inside jails			1
there have been complaints that prisons have become too soft and young criminals treat them like a ‘ holiday camp ’			0
@entity97 , the government ’s knife - crime adviser whose 16 - year - old brother @entity112 was stabbed to death in @entity114 , said it was time jails were turned back into ‘ places of punishment ’			0
@entity121 , from the think - tank @entity119 , says that perks such as free gym use and televisions in cells should be made available only to those inmates who work			0
he called for all prisoners to be given access to work and for those who refused to have their privileges downgraded or removed			2
mr @entity121 said : ‘ prisons are in desperate need of reform			0
the cornerstone of reform must be hard work			0
‘ it will make prison not only a better deterrent for criminals but also a far more successful intervention to stop future criminal behaviour			0
’ recently a watchdog warned that too many prisoners were idling in their cells watching daytime tv , while prison workshops were left empty			1
chief inspector of prisons @entity149 said that on a visit to @entity156 ’s largest jail , @entity158 prison in south west @entity114 , workshop facilities ‘ stood almost empty and too many staff appeared indifferent about the prisoners in their care ’ .			1

first review on regimes since 1999 will examine standards of prison life
prisons minister @entity15 ' worried ' about inmates being given privileges without *effort*
many prisoners have ' tv privileges ' with 4,000 understood to have @entity77
