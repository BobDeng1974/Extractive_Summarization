by @entity0 and @entity1 the @entity2 was accused of ‘ appeasement ’ last night as @entity4 opted to join @entity5 – and the @entity2 failed to get tough with @entity6			1
@entity7 persuaded fellow leaders to agree a three stage regime of punishments for @entity11 – but it fell far short of the ‘ serious consequences ’ promised this week			1
the @entity2 will immediately suspend talks on a new visa regime with @entity5 , abandon plans for the @entity17 and ditch plans for a new partnership deal between @entity5 and the @entity2 – but none of them hurts president @entity6 now and all three had been floated in advance			1
appeasement : @entity2 leaders have been accused of being too soft on @entity5 as it ramps up war games over the @entity26 crisis			1
pictured : @entity28 riot police block @entity30 activists in @entity31 , @entity26 , yesterday scuffles : pro-russians tackle @entity28 police yesterday			0
@entity5 tv has claimed @entity4 is part of its country anger : topless activists demonstrate against @entity5 intervention in @entity26 yesterday in @entity41 action : the @entity43 , with secretary of state @entity44 , has sent fighter jets to protect the @entity47 states and last night the @entity43 sent fighter jets to protect the @entity47 republics after warnings from former @entity52 leader @entity51 - whose country was invaded in 2005 – that @entity6 would strike there next			1
he said : ‘ it will not stop here			0
if mr @entity6 succeeds he will go after the @entity47 countries next			2
the @entity2 and @entity58 need to act now			0
they should consider the full range of options , from economic sanctions to military deterrence			0
’ serious : @entity7 has held emergency talks with @entity64 , but this ' selfie ' was widely mocked the @entity43 government yesterday announced asset freezes and travel bans against @entity6 ’s henchmen who led the invasion			1
but @entity2 leaders said they would only move to those tactics if @entity5 refuses talks with @entity28 leaders – and then failed to impose a deadline , saying economic sanctions and a crackdown on @entity5 financiers would only happen if @entity6 seizes the rest of @entity26			1
@entity81 officials credited mr @entity7 and @entity83 premier @entity82 with persuading a reluctant @entity85 chancellor @entity84 to consider asset freezes and travel bans in the future			0
but even mr @entity7 admitted : ‘ it is not as much as some people would want but we have made some progress			0
’ his own officials were withering about the @entity2 ’s timidity			0
a senior official in @entity94 compared the @entity2 ’s failure to act to the appeasement of @entity97 at @entity98 in 1938 and the reluctance to upset @entity5 in the @entity101 summit at the end of the @entity103 which gave the @entity104 a free rein in @entity106			1
the source told the @entity108 : ‘ @entity109 – now twinned with @entity101 and @entity98			0
’ the @entity2 leaders appeared to have been caught on the hop as the @entity4 ’s puppet @entity111 voted unanimously for the province to leave @entity26 and join @entity5			1
president @entity6 is now backing a referendum in @entity4 on march 16 - tantamount to annexing the province			2
maps on at least one @entity5 tv station yesterday showed the peninsula as being part of @entity5 territory , not of @entity26			1
a senior official said that if the referendum goes ahead , all state property would be ‘ nationalised ’ , the @entity5 rouble could be adopted and @entity28 troops would be treated as occupiers and forced to surrender or leave			2
tensions : residents hold the @entity104 flag outside the parliament building in @entity130 , @entity26 , yesterday war games : @entity6 faces outside intervention , but many have warned it is not tough enough protest : one of the @entity136 women is carried off two @entity136 women staged topless demonstrations with slogans written across their bodies yesterday in @entity4 ’s capital @entity130			2
as hundreds of protesters celebrated the decision of the local parliament for the region to join @entity5 , the pair repeatedly yelled ‘ @entity153 ’s war ’ despite a volley of punches and abuse from the hostile crowd of @entity151			2
one of the women – with a red floral headdress on her blonde hair – was quickly seized			0
@entity159 paramilitaries dragged her away , one firing pepper spray in her face from close quarters			0
the second , with shorter black hair , ran around shouting before being grabbed by police and @entity30 vigilantes .			0
