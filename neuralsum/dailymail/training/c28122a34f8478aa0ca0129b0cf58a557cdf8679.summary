by @entity0 published : 07:36 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 09:35 est , 29 april 2013 when you think of a human , you probably think of somebody who is more or less like you			0
but when @entity6 volunteers faced the question of what image to use as their main picture on the site 's @entity10 , they could n't merely upload an image from their webcam			1
the page , which details facts about our own species in the most general terms , instead shows at the top an image of a rural couple from @entity24 's indigenous @entity23 people			1
this is us : the rural couple from northern @entity24 's @entity23 hill tribe who are the main picture on @entity6 's article on the ' human ' , which has been the subject of fierce debate as to its suitability but critics have questioned whether the picture is actually most representative of ' human ' , given the range of circumstances and attributes associated with our species			1
there have even been accusations that the choice has more to do concerns for political correctness than choosing an image which best fits the subject it is intended to illustrate			0
it appears though that there is good reasoning behind the choice , and the decision was taken following lengthy debate between the site 's volunteer editors			1
the main article image on the human article on @entity6 shows a couple from @entity24 's @entity23 people , a hill tribe indigenous to the country 's less - developed north			1
they are standing with their backs to a verdant valley , their faces are expressionless and they are wearing plain , functional farmers ' clothing			0
the man carries the stem from a banana tree that will be fed to his family 's pigs			0
main picture : where the image appears on the wikipedia page which details facts about our own species in the most general terms			1
critics have questioned whether the picture is actually most representative of ' human ' a @entity87 thread was started by one member of the question and answer community who recently asked why @entity6 would choose this specific picture to describe ' human '			1
the questioner asks : ' i mean , are there no images that would better symbolise or be more representative of the species and its characteristics ? ' the top - voted answer by @entity101 , a photographer from @entity102 , points out that @entity6 's editors had already had a long and at times heated debate regarding the suitability of the picture			2
at least one editor had suggested that the picture should show a ' modern ' couple , such as an image of an ' industrial @entity112 business man and woman ' who would represent ' the height of human progress '			2
another claimed that this pinnacle of human achievement would be best represented by photos of the moon landings			2
the suggestion was dismissed because the images show the space suits , but not really the humans within			0
others claimed that prior discussions had concluded that the engraving on the plaques on the @entity130 spacecraft should be used , which show figures of an apparently white and @entity133 man and a woman intended to be seen by any alien life they come across			0
' height of human progress ' : some of @entity6 's editors suggested that a @entity133 - style businessman would be more fitting for the page 's main image , while others said the lunar landings would show how far we 've come there even accusations that the use of the image of the @entity23 couple was a ' pathetic and bureaucratic attempt at portraying modern humanity ' since most humans now live in urban areas			1
' let 's face it : the only reason this picture is here is because nobody wants to be deal with the inevitable charge of racism for using a much more suitable photo of a white or @entity165 person , ' wrote @entity6 editor @entity166			2
and there were even claims , summarily dismissed , that the image was sexist since it places ' the male ahead of the female '			0
for et : the engraving on the plaques on the @entity130 spacecraft , which show figures of an apparently white and @entity133 man and a woman and are intended to be seen by any alien life they come across after all the debate , editors finally concluded that the picture of the @entity23 couple is ' just about perfect ' because it shows ' average ' humans			1
they decided this because most people are not white - skinned , nor black , but in fact are a varying shade of brown ; most people are from @entity193 which , with about 4.2billion inhabitants , is host to 60 per cent of the human population ; within @entity193 , the most numerous group are @entity198 , the region from which the portraits subjects hail			0
taking into account criticisms that most humans were now living in cities , @entity6 editor @entity202 pointed out that most people ' throughout history ' have been farmers , although an updated image could show a pair of factory workers			2
further , most people throughout history have been male or female , with very few exceptions , mr @entity202 explains , while most people have also been ' pretty poor , but not shockingly poor '			0
thus it was decided to leave the photo as it stands .			0

main picture on the online *encyclopaedia* 's ' human ' article shows a couple from @entity24 's indigenous @entity23 people
critics had questioned whether the image best represented humans in the 21st century
but the site 's volunteer editors concluded that the image shows an ' average ' human and should be left
