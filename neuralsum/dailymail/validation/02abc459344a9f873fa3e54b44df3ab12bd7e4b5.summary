an asteroid so large it has the potential to cause widespread devastation is on its way towards @entity4			1
but despite being called a ‘ @entity7 ’ ( @entity7 ) by @entity6 , experts are telling people not to be worried			1
the huge rock , called 2014 @entity10 , will sail past the planet tomorrow morning at a distance so large it it is 11.7 times further than the distance between @entity4 and the moon			1
it was discovered by the @entity20 at the @entity21			1
the asteroid is estimated to be 1,640ft - wider ( 500 metres ) which would be large enough to cause devastation - but it will not hit @entity4 and while this event will occur without incident , the experts added it is a reminder of how many dangerous space rocks there are in our planet ’s vicinity			1
the asteroid is estimated to be about 1,640ft ( 500 metres ) wide which , if it hit @entity4 , would be large enough to cause widespread devastation - although there is no chance of this happening			1
however , it is estimated that there are about 25,000 near - @entity4 objects ( @entity42 ) larger than 460ft ( 140 metres ) , bodies that come close to @entity4 but do n't necessarily hit our planet			1
and there are also an estimated 1,000 @entity42 larger than 3,280ft ( one kilometre ) , highlighting the need to keep track of these space rocks			2
on average , @entity4 is hit by a football pitch - sized rock every 5,000 years , and a civilisation - ending asteroid every one million years , according to @entity6 's @entity42			1
last year , the privately - funded @entity53 discovered that @entity4 is up to 10 times more likely to be hit than previously thought			1
while the majority of the impacts occur either high up in the atmosphere , or in unpopulated areas including the @entity61 and @entity60 , the danger was still ever - present			0
the findings were based on information released from the @entity64			0
this operates a network of sensors that monitor @entity4 around the clock listening for the infrasound signatures of nuclear detonations			0
but what these sensors found were not nuclear explosions , but rather asteroid impacts on a huge scale			0
between 2000 and 2013 the network detected 26 explosions on @entity4 ranging in energy from one to 600 kilotons - all caused by asteroid impacts			2
relative to @entity4 , asteroid 2014 @entity10 is travelling at 23,000 mph ( 37,000 km / h ) , and its closest approach tomorrow will be 2,779,956 miles ( 4,473,907km )			1
it was first discovered by the @entity20 at the @entity21 in december 2014 , and will make an even closer , but still safe , approach in 2033 - 2,069,166 miles ( 3,330,000km )			1
@entity6 lists 2014 @entity10 as a ‘ @entity7 ’ ( @entity7 ) but , as yet , there is no chance of an impact scheduled for any point in future			1
‘ this “ potential ” to make close @entity4 approaches does not mean a @entity7 will impact the @entity4 , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ it only means there is a possibility for such a threat			0
' by monitoring these @entity95 and updating their orbits as new observations become available , we can better predict the close - approach statistics and thus their @entity4 - impact threat			2
’ but speaking to the @entity103 , dr @entity100 , professor of astronomy at the @entity102 , warned there was a ‘ very real risk ’ of an object hitting @entity4 at some point in the future			0
‘ with something like @entity10 , we are looking at a scale of global destruction , something that would pose a risk to the continuation of the planet , ’ he said			0
‘ these events are however very rare , it is the smaller yet still very damaging impacts which are a very real threat			0
’ shown is the path of asteroid 2014 @entity10 tomorrow			2
a ; though it looks like it will come extremely close to @entity4 , it will actually pass very safely at a distance of 0.03 @entity126			2
a single @entity126 - @entity126 - is the distance from @entity4 to the sun credit : @entity6 last year experts warned that we must do more to track asteroids , as one could cause widespread damage to the planet			1
most notably , in february 2013 , hundreds of people were injured when a meteor exploded near the city of @entity137 in @entity138 - the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century in the past year , a host of famous science names have joined forces to warn the world of the threat posed to @entity4 by asteroids			2
in december , more than 100 leading scientists and astronauts from dr @entity147 to @entity148 signed a declaration asking for increased action to tackle objects that could end life on @entity4			0
the experts called for a 100-fold increase in the detection and monitoring of so - called near @entity4 objects ( @entity42 )			2
it is estimated that of the million or so asteroids that could cause major damage on @entity4 , we are aware of only about 10,000 - or one per cent			1
this means that at any moment an asteroid could enter the atmosphere and cause widespread destruction , without any prior knowledge			0
the possibility of this scenario has been repeatedly hinted at recently by meteorites and fireballs spotted in the sky			0
yesterday @entity6 released details of its @entity173 ( illustrated ) , which will see astronauts study an asteroid in space next decade			2
the mission is estimated to cost about £ 840 million ( $ 1.25 billion ) , not including launch costs , and is targeted for liftoff in december 2020 most notably , in february 2013 hundreds of people were injured when a meteor exploded near the city of @entity137 in @entity138 , the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century			0
and in 1908 , a comet exploded over the upper atmosphere in the sparse region of @entity187 , @entity188 , devastating an area about the size of a major metropolitan region – 800 square miles ( 2,000 square km )			0
‘ the more we learn about asteroid impacts , the clearer it becomes that the human race has been living on borrowed time , ’ dr @entity147 said in a statement in december			0
‘ we are currently aware of less than one per cent of objects comparable to the one that impacted at @entity187 , and nobody knows when the next big one will hit			0
‘ it takes just one			0

@entity10 will pass 2.8 million miles from @entity4 tomorrow
it was discovered by the @entity20 at the @entity21
@entity6 *classifies* it as a ' @entity7 ' ( @entity7 )
the asteroid is estimated to be 1,640 feet - wide ( 500 metres )
this would be large enough to cause devastation - but it will not hit @entity4
in fact it will sail past at distance that is 11.7 times further than the distance between the @entity4 and the moon
experts said , however , it highlights a need to do more to track asteroids
