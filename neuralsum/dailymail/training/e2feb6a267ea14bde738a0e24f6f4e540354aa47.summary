by @entity0 the chances of @entity2 and the rest of our boys winning the @entity6 this summer are , to be realistic , not particularly high			0
unlike the price of the new replica @entity9 shirt unveiled yesterday			0
fans reacted with fury when they learned they must fork out £ 90 to wear the latest @entity9 design			1
anger : @entity9 revealed its new kit with the short alone costing £ 90 for adults and £ 40 for children ' rip - off ' : there have been calls for a boycott of the shirt ten months after the last one came out a parent wanting to get the full @entity26 kit – shirt , shorts and socks – for a 12 - year - old would have to pay between £ 71 and £ 119			1
hundreds of supporters and some players took to @entity33 to lambast @entity26 and the @entity34 over the prices			1
@entity37 's @entity36 , who has played for @entity9 , tweeted : ' £ 90 for the new @entity9 shirt is taking the mickey out of the fans			1
when will it stop ? ' it 's literally a white sports top with an @entity9 badge on			0
costs about £ 2 to make in some sweatshop in the east			0
@entity34 again allows commercialism to eat away at its soul			2
something has got to give			0
' he suggested ordinary fans are being priced out of following the national game , adding : ' when will football / brands start to stop pricing them out			0
' fans on @entity33 called the high prices a rip - off and outrageous			1
the kit – in both a white and a red away version – has been launched just ten months after the shirts were last changed in may 2013			1
this appears to be at odds with a long - standing convention to protect the pockets of fans by changing the national team kit only every two years			2
red alert : the @entity9 away kit for this summer 's @entity6 features fabric makers @entity26 says will keep players cool @entity73 : there has been huge anger online with fans , including former striker @entity77 , passing on tips on how to make your own new shirt using older similar tops making a point : in lampooning the new shirt , accounts have shown people how to make something very similar @entity26 pointed out that as well as the £ 90 ' match ' shirt – designed for adults , but which many children will want – it is also offering a ' stadium ' version			1
it has some small differences in design and materials and costs £ 60 for adults and £ 42 for children , who also pay slightly less for shorts and socks			0
but @entity101 player @entity77 , now a pundit , tweeted : ' a joke , just make one please , £ 90 is a rip - off			1
' the row comes 11 years after the @entity34 , sports retailers and clubs were fined more than £ 16million for colluding to inflate the price of shirts			2
all white : rooney models the new home strip but there are grave concerns about the price by fans home : the white strip sports a v - neck collar is meant to be a nod to shirts of the past - worn here proudly by captain @entity122 for the 1954 @entity6 the new £ 90 shirt is exactly the same as that to be worn by @entity9 at the @entity6 in @entity126 this summer			1
@entity26 claims the price is justified because of the innovative cooling technology built into the kit to cope with high temperatures			2
@entity26 took over the lucrative @entity9 kit supply deal from @entity132 last year and is paying £ 25million a year to the @entity34 which said it has no control over the cost of shirts			1
an @entity34 spokesman said : ' the @entity34 is a not - for - profit organisation that puts £ 100million back into the game every year			2
it is through relationships with partners such as @entity26 that we are able to maintain that level of investment in football			0
' * pubs and bars will be able to stay open late on the evenings of @entity9 's matches in @entity126 – until 1am for 9pm and 11pm kick - offs , or midnight for an 8pm start			0
ministers gave the go - ahead despite fears among police , councils and residents ' groups that extended hours would lead to anti-social behaviour .			0

@entity34 *accused* of greed after *releasing* new kit ten months after the last one
fans call for boycott of ' rip - off ' shirt that will cost £ 40 for children
makers @entity26 say £ 90 top is made from cooling fabric and tailored
