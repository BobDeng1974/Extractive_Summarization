but while some resort to earplugs or double - glazing to shut out the din , some ingenious pupils close to @entity5 airport have found a novel way to fight the roar of jet engines - by building ' @entity14 ' shaped domes			1
@entity17 infants ' school has erected four igloo - like adobe domes in its grounds , of a type normally used in earthquakes and emergency zones , to muffle the noise			1
students from @entity17 infants school play around one of four adobe huts designed to help minimise the noise of aircraft landing at @entity5 the playground is directly under the flight path of @entity5 's southern runway and outside play for the children is interrupted every two minutes or so by landing aircraft passing over their heads the playground is directly under the flight path of @entity5 's southern runway and outside play for the children is interrupted every two minutes or so by landing aircraft passing over their heads			1
' when children were playing outside , they had nowhere to go - they were subjected to that noise , ' said the school 's principal @entity46			2
the domes , an invention of @entity51 architect @entity50 , were originally meant for lunar settlements and were first employed in a refugee crisis after the 1990 - 91 @entity54 , but they work just fine for the children in west @entity57 too			1
' for play time it 's fantastic that they have somewhere to withdraw - even the ones that are too young to articulate that they 're feeling concerned about the noise , ' ms @entity46 said			2
the domes have no doors so are an open space but with a ' strong psychological and physical barrier ' against the noise , she said			2
she estimates that when outside , teachers are inaudible to pupils for 25 seconds in every 90 because of the jets			0
the domes , an invention of @entity51 architect @entity50 , were originally meant for lunar settlements the domes have no doors so are an open space but have a ' strong psychological and physical barrier ' against the noise ' you can still hear the planes in the huts but you can also hear your own voice , ' she said			1
the school teaches 520 infants aged between three and seven and its experiment with the domes has prompted others in the area to consider following suit			2
planes pass just 180 metres ( 600 ft ) over the area and their engines emit a noise level of 87 decibels			1
sound tests inside the domes showed a noise reduction of over 17 decibels and a considerable reduction in the duration of the noise , according to the website of @entity101 which makes the structures			1
the domes , which have also been installed in the @entity105 foothills of @entity106 , are made out of bags of coiled earth tubes in an igloo - shape			0
the technology avoids using expensive construction materials and the cost of transporting them			0

' a couple of rolls of barbed wire and a roll of tubing and you 're there ! ' @entity131 dug from the construction site is compressed into tubular bags which are laid one on top of the other to form walls			0
barbed wire is placed between the layers to hold the bags together			0
the bags are laid in a circle with a decreasing diameter of the rows towards the top			0
aircraft noise is a thorny political issue for the government , as it tries to establish where and how to expand airport capacity			2
business leaders and airlines are pressing him to expand @entity5 , a move which would affect the 750,000 people living under the flight path			1
options for increasing capacity at @entity5 include a third runway and allowing planes to land and take - off on its two runways at the same time instead of the current alternating pattern			0
' having quiet time is absolutely critical			0
to lose runway alternation would be a disaster , ' said @entity46 .			0
