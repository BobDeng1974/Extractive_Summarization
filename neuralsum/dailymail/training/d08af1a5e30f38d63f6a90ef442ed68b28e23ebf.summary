the first culottes i ever saw were in @entity2			1
though i was a 15 - year - old from @entity3 and only just waking up to the idea of fashion , i remember thinking how ludicrous they looked			1
but @entity7 and @entity8 from @entity9 wore culottes , so i ventured to @entity11 to try on a billowing blue pair			1
i left empty - handed because they looked far too grown - up and dwarfed me			2
@entity14 , a strange skirt / shorts hybrid , are said to have the practicality and comfort of trousers , but the feminine look of a skirt			1
not seen much since the @entity26 , this season they ’ve staged a comeback and are everywhere on the @entity25 , spurred on by designers such as @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
i ’ve never owned a pair			2
working as a tv presenter for more than 20 years on @entity34 and @entity35 , i learned the importance of clean lines and shapes , and what suits me			2
at 5ft 6in , i ’m not tiny , but prefer to elongate my legs			2
and having lost a stone in the past year , i like well - fitting clothes that show off my shape			2
surely culottes will make me look shorter , pile on the pounds and give me thunder thighs ? i tried on six @entity25 pairs to see if i could finally be converted to culottes			1
slimming black is ideal for culottes			1
a fitted top and metallic belt define your waist			2
i ’d wear these to a smart event on a windy evening and be thrilled the hemline did n't fly up ! leg width : 38cm rating : 4/5 @entity70 but slimming comfy : culottes , £ 20 , @entity73 , £ 69 , @entity74 , £ 49.99 , zara.com these were the most comfortable and a real bargain			1
the paper - thin fabric ensured my legs looked slim			2
i like the pattern , but it needs a pop of colour on top			0
you could wear these during the day or even out for the evening , but they need killer heels to prevent them from looking old - fashioned			0
leg width : 39cm rating : 3/5 a denim disaster unflattering : culottes , £ 145 , @entity91 , £ 35 , hobbs.co.uk shoes , £ 50 , riverisland.co.uk help ! i look like @entity93 in keeping up appearances when she heads off to sea in stripes and acres of skirt			1
you ’d have to be minute to wear wide - bottomed culottes without looking as big as a house			1
my hips look gargantuan , my legs are shortened			0
these hang like curtains , drowning my figure			0
hideous ! leg width : 41cm rating : 0/5 they 're man @entity110 ridiculous : culottes , £ 40 , @entity112 , £ 45 , @entity113 , £ 69.99 , zara.com i can see why some people call culottes man repellers			1
these swamp my legs — i want to hoist them up , pin them back or make a parachute out of them			0
though cream is a lovely winter shade that lifts my complexion , these mask the natural shape of my legs , which i ’ve worked hard to keep			0
no one could get away with these			0
leg width : 38cm rating : 1/5 @entity130 not sexy : faux leather culottes , £ 45 , @entity132 , £ 29.99 , @entity133 , £ 29.50 , debenhams.com faux leather can look sexy , but these had too low a crotch and loose a leg			1
waist pleats tailored the fabric to sit tidily against my hips , but the bottom half sticks out stiffly like a panto costume			0
toughened up with a big sweater and biker boots these might look better , but not by much			0
leg width : 36cm rating : 2/5 satin soft and stylish top pick : culottes , £ 45 , @entity153 , £ 95 , @entity154 , £ 185 , lucychoilondon.com my clear favourite			1
the fabric was satin soft , lined and excellent quality			0
they looked and felt designer			0
the length is spot on for culottes — any shorter and they would look boyish			1
the dusty pale pink complements my complexion and blonde hair			0
my waist looked trim and the overall effect was neat and chic			0
leg width : 37cm rating : 5/5 styling : @entity172 : l + @entity173 & makeup : @entity175 using @entity177 assistant : @entity178			0
