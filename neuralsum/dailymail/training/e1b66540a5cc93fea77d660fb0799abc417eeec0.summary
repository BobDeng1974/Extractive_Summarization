an incredible video has shown the nail - biting moment a seaplane came within inches of landing on a humpback whale			2
the footage taken by witness @entity7 last week shows the near - collision in the remote @entity10 village of @entity11 , which is only accessible by boat or plane			1
on the video , a @entity15 seaplane from @entity16 can be seen trying to land and getting within inches of the surface before suddenly accelerating away from the water			1
i thought , " @entity32 something must be wrong " , ' @entity30 told @entity33			0
but if you watch the video closely you can see water being forced upwards through the whale 's blowhole as the plane attempts to land			0
after he decides to accelerate again , the pilot soars through a cloud of droplets from the blowhole before eventually landing safely			0
' damn near landed right on that f * * * ing whale ! ' one shocked witness can be heard yelling on the video , with another adding : ' he had to go right over it ! ' near miss : reacting to the commotion from people along the shore , the pilot decides against landing on the water - just as he flies through the droplets forced up by the whale relief : witnesses along the shore exhale with relief as the seaplane makes a safe landing moments later scene : the seaplane landed on the @entity10 island of @entity11 - which is only accessible by plane or boat @entity30 said he showed the video to the pilot , who had no idea he was flying above the humpback whale			1
instead , he had decided to put off his landing after seeing people on the shore pointing and yelling			2
after the pilot pulled away , the whale breached , @entity30 said - and they all agreed the pilot had had a lucky escape .			0

a @entity15 seaplane *narrowly* *avoided* *colliding* with a whale near @entity11 , @entity10 last week
but when the pilot saw the footage , he said he had n't even seen the whale and was instead reacting to the people yelling at him from the shore
