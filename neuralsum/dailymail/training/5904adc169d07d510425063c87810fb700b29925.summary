newcastle expect to complete the process of identifying potential replacements for @entity3 within the next 48 hours			2
managing director @entity4 and chief scout @entity5 are drawing up a list of around 10 potential candidates to provide the basis for discussions early next week			0
that list will then be whittled down to the men the pair believe can fulfil the role of head coach at @entity15 - and , perhaps more importantly , whether or not they are available , either immediately or at some point in the near future , and would work within the ‘ continental ’ model the club has adopted			2
@entity21 took charge of @entity0 as they were beaten 1 - 0 by @entity24 in the @entity25 on saturday sources on @entity27 insist that no - one has yet been approached and certainly no offers have been made			1
however , it is understood that among the names which will be considered at this early stage are @entity34 ’s @entity33 , former @entity36 boss @entity35 , @entity38 ’s @entity37 , @entity40 manager @entity39 and @entity42 chief @entity41			0
@entity33 has already indicated that he will not walk out on his current employers this season , while @entity35 is currently taking a sabbatical and @entity37 , who signed a new three - year deal last summer , has distanced himself from the vacancy			0
head coach of @entity49 @entity33 is reportedly under consideration for the @entity0 job @entity37 has been linked with leaving @entity38 to take the vacant job at @entity15 former manager @entity3 left @entity0 to take over at @entity53 after four years at the club @entity40 manager @entity39 salutes the @entity56 fans after the 5 - 1 win at @entity58 in the @entity25 however , those details and possible resolutions will form part of the early discussions , and what is clear is that @entity4 and @entity5 , who are being given free rein by owner @entity65 , will not appoint in haste			1
in the circumstances , @entity3 ’s assistant @entity21 - he was criticised by some fans for fielding a weakened side for saturday ’s 1 - 0 @entity25 third - round defeat by @entity24 , although later insisted it was as a result of injuries and fatigue - and first - team coach @entity76 are likely to remain in charge for next weekend ’s @entity79 trip to @entity80			1
the @entity81 currently sit in 10th place in the table , with 27 points from their opening 20 fixtures , and the top - 10 finish @entity65 set as the minimum requirement for the season is now their only remaining objective			0
@entity91 ( left ) scored the only goal of the game as @entity24 beat @entity0 in the @entity25 @entity95 goalkeeper @entity94 is hopeless to stop the only goal of the game at @entity24 on saturday			1

@entity24 beat @entity0 1 - 0 in the @entity98 on saturday
*caretaker* boss @entity21 wants the job after @entity3 *'s* departure
