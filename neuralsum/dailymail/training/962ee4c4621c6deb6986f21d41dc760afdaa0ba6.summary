too young : @entity0 in a @entity2 advert @entity2 handbags have long been a proud example of the best of @entity7 craftsmanship and are one of the most coveted designer brands			1
from the butter - soft leathers that give the @entity11 and the @entity12 their characteristic luxuriant slouch to the discreet functionality of their classic clipper holdalls , @entity2 is one of our most desired labels			1
but everything is not rosy in the company ’s @entity22 home			0
on the stock market , its share price fell by a quarter in recent days — from being worth £ 1.5 billion in its heyday , the value has dropped to around £ 400 million			0
those stark figures hint at trouble afoot			0
and it ’s no surprise : the classic @entity11 bag , beloved by middle - class mums everywhere , cost £ 495 five years ago			1
now it is at least £ 895 for the basic edition , with most @entity34 priced at more than £ 1,100			1
not surprisingly , this has driven away many of the brand ’s core fans			2
fashion experts pinpoint the change to the arrival of a new @entity42 ceo 18 months ago			0
@entity43 — hailing from the snootiest of @entity42 brands , @entity46 — has been accused of having little understanding of @entity2 ’s @entity7 character			1
he has determinedly driven the brand from upmarket , aspirational luxury to the stratospheric end of the price scale			1
@entity43 is said to be determined to take @entity2 from its cosy , country roots into the same category as brands such as @entity57 and @entity58			2
and it ’s not just the classic @entity11 handbag			0
today , @entity2 ’s small @entity62 evening bag is £ 750 — six months ago , it was £ 595			1
@entity43 - hailing from the snootiest of @entity42 brands , @entity46 - has been accused of having little understanding of @entity2 's @entity7 character an @entity12 tote in oak buffalo is £ 1,100 — a couple of years ago , it was £ 795			1
in ostrich , rather than leather ? that will be £ 4,500 , thank you			0
the cheapest bag is a tiny @entity11 clutch at £ 495			1
still want to buy into @entity2 ? you can always pick up a leather keyring for £ 60			2
top personal shopper @entity76 thinks @entity2 is out of the reach of the vast majority of shoppers , creating serious problems for the brand			2
today , @entity2 's small @entity62 evening bag is £ 750 - six months ago , it was £ 595 her clients are busy spending their money at @entity86 — the irony being that while @entity2 reaches a level where its core @entity7 market can no longer afford it , its manufacturing quality and breadth of design simply are not up to scratch in the international luxury market			1
‘ prices are off the scale , ’ she says			0
‘ they compete with @entity86 and @entity46 , but they ’re just not as innovative			0
’ @entity2 is clearly no longer the cottage industry that founder @entity99 began in @entity22 in 1971 with a £ 500 gift from his father			2
since a takeover in 2002 , growth — and serious profit — has been high on the agenda			0
@entity2 issued it - bag after it - bag — the @entity107 , the @entity11 , the @entity12 , the @entity108 — and courted the celebrities of the moment			1
prices crept up of course , and then the @entity113 hove into view : @entity115 , the great hope of every luxury brand with @entity119 dollar signs in its eyes			0
yet , while they price their products for rich @entity124 shoppers , @entity7 still represents the majority of @entity2 ’s customer base , as well as providing its design dna and international kudos			2
indeed , a newly opened second @entity22 factory is helping achieve the company ’s aim of making half of its goods in @entity7			0
but @entity2 ’s @entity7 fanbase has noticed the change — the new bag they save up for over a number of years has gone up by hundreds of pounds			1
and they ’re turning their back on the brand as a result			0
business experts , meanwhile , suggest @entity2 should reduce its bag prices to between £ 200 and £ 600 , to compete with the middle - market likes of @entity145 and @entity146			1
the @entity108 ( left ) and @entity147 ( right ) bags : could such young celebrities alienate grown - up customers not that there ’s anything wrong in seeking new customers , but constantly raising prices to generate exclusivity surely underestimates the intelligence and tolerance of its customers			1
@entity2 ’s obsession with celebrity may also be problematic : @entity76 believes that the young , hip likes of @entity0 , @entity147 and @entity108 , alienate its more ‘ grown - up ’ customers			1
it ’s a fair point : the young might be more reckless spenders , but they are less well - cushioned from hard times than their parents and grandparents , less equipped to recover , and have less cash to spend			0
so , where can mulberry fans go if they ca n’t face the prices ? i ’d point to @entity176 , another @entity7 brand that suffered mixed fortunes as it aimed for a cooler international crowd , is now back on track as it targets a homegrown , older , more affluent market			2
if you love the @entity11 , £ 895 , go for @entity176 ’s @entity185 instead , at £ 299			1
fans of the £ 1,100 @entity108 should take a look at the @entity188 , on sale in luscious tomato red at £ 149			2
and instead of a @entity192 clutch , £ 595 , go for the @entity191 at @entity176 , on sale for just £ 30			0
@entity176 understands that biting the hand that feeds you is an easy route to starvation			0
@entity2 might take note .			0
