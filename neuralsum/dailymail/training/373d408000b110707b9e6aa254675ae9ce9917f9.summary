by @entity0 published : 11:18 est , 24 february 2014 @entity2 : 12:33 est , 24 february 2014 one man from @entity4 wanted to cast his vote , but was cast out instead due to his t - shirt in support of 2nd amendment gun rights			1
@entity9 attempted to vote on the first day of early voting in the @entity12 primary but was nixed because he was wearing a t - shirt that read , ' 2nd amendment -- @entity15 € ™ s @entity16			1
' the t - shirt is donned with a skull and crossbones made of shotguns			2
it 's pro-gun and unbeknownst to him was against the @entity4 voting code			2
@entity9 wore a pro-gun shirt to the voting booth and was not allowed to cast his ballot the shirt read , ' 2nd amendment , @entity30 's original @entity29 ' and donned an image with a skill with cross bones made of guns @entity9 attended his local polling place at the @entity36 in @entity37 near @entity38 and overheard an employee discussing his controversial tee			1
' i heard a gentleman 's voice over my shoulder say â € ˜ he ca n't vote with that shirt on			1
you 'll have to either turn it inside out or you 'll have to leave , ' @entity9 told @entity48			1
@entity9 initially did n't understand why the polling staff were so focused on his shirt			1
he thought it was because they were either ' liberal ' or ' anti-gun			0
' ' i did n't quite understand it at first , ' he said			0
' i was thinking they just did n't like something about the @entity58			0
' the staff did n't stop @entity60 because they were liberal			0
they targeted him because he violated section 85.036 of the @entity64 pertaining to ' electioneering ' for or against any candidate			0
' during the time an early voting polling place is open for the conduct of early voting , a person may not electioneer for or against any candidate , measure , or political party in or within 100 feet of an outside door through which a voter may enter the building or structure in which the early voting polling place is located , ' states the code			0
the voting took place at the @entity36 in @entity37 the @entity12 primary ballot includes a question asking yes or no in support of the 2nd amendment in places where people are allowed to bear arms			1
since @entity9 's shirt advocated the 2nd amendment in gun - friendly @entity4 , his shirt is considered an attempt to express his political point of view			1
such electioneering is not allowed within 100 feet of the voting vicinity , as stated by the code			1
in addition to his wardrobe , @entity9 's @entity101 page is strongly pro-gun and his ' likes ' include groups like ' @entity106 , ' and ' @entity107			2
' even though he 's a fan of guns and of expressing his support for them , when going to the ballots in the future he should maintain a neutral appearance			2
officials explained that the code is not biased and that those wearing a shirt with an image of @entity119 on it also would be turned away from voting			2
@entity9 was finally allowed to vote when he borrowed a suit jacket from a fellow @entity12 candidate outside the courthouse			1
the gun - lover was n't angry with the polling staff and understood their point of view			0
he also said he had a message for his fellow @entity30			0
' if you have to turn around and go change shirts , you know , so be it , ' he said			0
' but get out and vote			0
' @entity60 's @entity101 likes strongly reflect someone who is pro gun			0

@entity9 was n't allowed to vote because of his shirt supporting ' the right to bear arms '
the @entity142 ballot includes a question asking yes or no on support of the 2nd amendment in places where people are allowed to keep guns
since his shirt was *relevant* to a question on the ballot it was considered ' electioneering ' and he was therefore prohibited from voting
