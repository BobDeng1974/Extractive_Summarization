in a nightclub on the @entity5 coast , a man wearing a hat to disguise his identity slips into the @entity7 stand and takes control of the decks , where he plays his records until sunrise			1
earlier that evening — in front of many of the same folk on the dance floor — that very same @entity7 had dictated a different kind of rhythm ... a football match in front of 55,000 fans at @entity22 ’s @entity21			1
only now has @entity23 revealed his secret in an interview which explores the football career he very nearly abandoned			1
@entity23 reflects on a playing career that has taken him from @entity28 to @entity29 and @entity30 the former @entity32 midfielder now works as a pundit for @entity35 's coverage of @entity28 's @entity36 @entity23 finished his playing career with a five - year spell with @entity32 but it is the subject of music which hits the right note with the former @entity22 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity32 star , who last month played the @entity46 in @entity47 made famous by @entity48			1
‘ it has always been my passion , ’ says the 40 - year - old			0
‘ my friend in @entity22 , who owned a record shop , used to @entity54 if i played on saturday i would then sneak into the club , but it was always off the record , i would wear a hat and go in disguise			1
i would then @entity7 and no - one would know it was me			1
’ @entity23 was a platinum - standard schemer who manipulated the mood of a match with his cunning			1
much like the @entity7 ‘ i do n’t have a setlist of what i ’m going to play			1
we take a box of vinyls and we only arrange the first few songs and then see how the mood is and what people want , ’ he says			0
‘ when you are on the pitch you have a split - second to decide a pass , it is the same as a @entity7 picking the next song			1
it is the same feeling of tension as playing football and i do get nervous before @entity54 ‘ but that is good , that ’s the way i enjoy things			1
it is the possibility of making people happy , seeing them having fun and going mad at your choice of song			0
‘ i play everything from @entity96 to @entity97 to @entity98			0
wherever i am in the world i always find the record shops			0
’ @entity23 revealed that his second love away from football was spinning tunes on his decks the former @entity22 midfielder used to sneak into clubs to @entity7 after playing matches at the @entity21 the @entity109 has likened playing a dj set to reacting to the the tempo on a football field while we had to wait until the turn of the millennium to see @entity23 in successive @entity117 finals with @entity22 and twice being named @entity118 , we could have witnessed his talents at the @entity120 had his life taken a different track			1
‘ my story is unusual , ’ he laughs , when asked about the journey which saw him become one of the world ’s most expensive footballers after @entity42 signed him from @entity22 for £ 30million in 2001			1
‘ at 14 i stopped playing football and dedicated my time to athletics			1
as a kid i used to go to athletics school where we would train three times a day and study			2
i loved it , it ’s what i wanted to do			0
i held the @entity139 record for 2,000 metres which stood for 15 years			0
‘ but when i was 16 i quit and went back to football and i signed for @entity142 ( in the @entity139 second division )			2
to be honest , i was n’t that good			2
i was a good athlete , so i would run and cover a lot of ground and then make a simple pass			2
‘ look at my early games with @entity142 and @entity22 , i could pass the ball , but i was nowhere near the player i became			1
my friends used to say : “ who is this kid ? he ca n’t keep the ball up three times ! ” ‘ they used to joke with me but then look what happened			0
i worked hard and my game became more about technique than running			0
’ @entity23 helped @entity139 side @entity22 reach successive @entity117 finals in 2000 and 2001 @entity23 became one of the world 's most expensive players when he signed for @entity42 in 2001 @entity23 lunges in on @entity163 's @entity162 during a loan spell with @entity43 in 2003 @entity23 was one of four brothers and their dad , @entity166 , was a professional with @entity163 , @entity167 and @entity168			1
his sons , however , were not born with natural talent			1
@entity172 goalkeeper and drummer @entity171 is good friends with @entity176 drummer @entity175 @entity178 boss @entity177 played guitar in @entity180 rock band @entity177 @entity181 was in a band in @entity183 with his brother called @entity185 trumpeter @entity186 formed the @entity188 salsa band at @entity189 ps it goes the other way too			2
@entity139 crooner @entity192 was @entity163 ’s reserve keeper before becoming a pop star			0
‘ my brothers were n’t very good and i was n’t great but i just wanted to improve so badly so i practised for days and days			2
i used to go to fields with my brothers and my dad to practise			0
i used to go in a squash court with a ball and just kick , kick , kick			0
my dad was really sad when i quit for athletics because he would have loved me to be a footballer			2
but he always supported me because both he and my mum wanted me to be happy			0
so they were very proud at what i went on to achieve			0
’ what did he achieve ? eight goals in 40 caps for @entity28 , the @entity117 runners - up medals , a @entity210 with @entity22 and a @entity211 at @entity32			1
so how did he end up on @entity212 ? ‘ the chance to come to @entity30 arose in a way i did n’t expect , ’ says @entity23 , whose first season at @entity42 had been an unhappy one			1
‘ @entity217 and @entity218 , the chief executive , turned up at the training ground in @entity220			0
‘ they told me about the new project they wanted to build			0
i told them i would think about it but , after a little time , i thought , “ why not ? ”			0
i wanted to be part of their plans and help them make history — which i did			0
’ former @entity30 manager @entity232 convinced @entity23 to come to @entity32 the @entity109 has no regrets in signing for @entity32 and has even moved back into the area @entity23 poses with teammates after winning the 2004 @entity211 with @entity32 indeed , @entity23 loved the @entity236 so much that he only swapped it for @entity238 last year , so he would be closer to his work with @entity35 , where he is a pundit for their @entity36 coverage			1
@entity23 , who has two daughters , is busy juggling his music , punditry and commitment to earning his coaching badges			2
it would , you feel , be a loss if he never returned to a training pitch , for he has learned from some of the game ’s greatest , including @entity251 at @entity43			1
‘ he was great , ’ says @entity23			2
‘ even if he comes across as quite distant and authoritative , he ’s not , you can talk to him any time			0
‘ i remember in pre-season two of the players ’ wives had given birth and we thought he would not let them go			0
but he told them “ go , see your family , come back when you are ready ”			0
the 40 - year - old revealed he almost chose a career in athletics over football as a youngster @entity23 backs his former manager @entity251 to be a success at @entity266 ‘ but he needs time			1
he likes to do things in his own way and what he believes to be the best way for the team			0
@entity272 has the hunger for that , otherwise he would not have come			0
he sees @entity266 as a challenge and wants to take them where they deserve to be			2
’ @entity23 , then , is backing his old boss to get @entity266 in tune			1
as for himself ? ‘ if you ’d asked me a few years back about management i would say no. but now , you never know , ’ he says			0
kind of like his next record , @entity23 will see where the mood takes him			2
@entity284 reveals desire to coach @entity266 this season @entity35 5 will show up to 600 live matches from @entity289 qualifiers , the @entity117 , @entity36 , @entity210 , @entity291 and @entity290 .			1
