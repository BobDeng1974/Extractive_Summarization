by @entity0 published : 14:25 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 16:21 est , 10 march 2014 looks help men get ahead in business - but attractive women face a battle to climb the ladder , according to new research			1
a study showed investors are more likely to put money into ventures if the man making the pitch is handsome			0
however , female entrepreneurs blessed with good looks are no more likely to be successful than their less physically endowed counterparts			0
blessing or curse ? good - looking businessmen like @entity22 's @entity21 will climb the ladder easily but their female equivalent such as @entity26 's @entity25 will not have found it so simple , the study says the findings , published in the journal @entity30 , also suggest there is a glass ceiling for women in the corporate world because backers prefer presentations from men			1
in @entity40 , just four @entity39 companies have female chief executives , and 90 per cent of growing venture capital firms in the @entity43 are founded or led by men			2
researchers at @entity45 recruited 60 experienced and affluent backers to view video recordings of 90 randomly - selected verbal business pitches made by entrepreneurs from various business sectors at three contests in the @entity43			1
the investors - who were unaware of each contest 's outcome - were asked to rate the looks of the entrepreneurs			0
though @entity58 achieved world fame as an entrepreneur , the study claims her looks wo n't have helped did @entity64 ceo @entity63 's youthful looks help him reach one of the top jobs in media ? among the women , those who were deemed attractive were not necessarily the most effective speakers			1
conversely , attractive men were thought to give the best presentations			1
the panel also found male voices were much better at securing deals than female ones			2
dr @entity77 , of @entity45 , said : ' we identifiy a profound and consistent sex gap in entrepreneurship - a central path to job creation , economic growth and prosperity			2
' across a field setting and two controlled experiments we find investors prefer entrepreneurial pitches presented by males compared with picthes presented by females - even when the content of the pitch is the same			0
@entity95 ceo @entity94 - who is soon moving to @entity96 - is very attractive but that will not have been a factor in her climb to success , @entity45 found , whereas it may have helped @entity101 ' attractive males are particularly persuasive whereas physical attractiveness does not matter among female entrepreneurs			1
' these findings fundamentally advance the science related to sex , physical attractiveness , psychological persuasion , bias , role expectations and entrepreneurship			0
' to the extent female entrepreneurs are disadvantaged in entrepreneurial pitching simply by virtue of their sex then women may remain under - represented in the entrepreneurial economy			0
' moreover the power of male attractiveness to persuade evaluators to select one pitch over another suggests entrepreneurial opportunities may also be unevenly distributed even within the male population			0

@entity45 found attractive men consistently secure deals
a panel of 60 business backers rated looks and effectiveness of speech
women who secured deals were not necessarily attractive , *unlike* the men
