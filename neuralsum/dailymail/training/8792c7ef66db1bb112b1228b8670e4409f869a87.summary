by @entity0 this is the moment a group of lemurs scrambled down a tree and burst into a fantastic dance display which would n't have looked out of place in @entity7			1
the primates had been eating berries from the top of the tall bark when they decided to cross a dirt road to a cluster of other trees			1
as they landed on the ground each one burst into an array of impressive dance moves , including twirls , jumps , spins and stretches staying alive : this lemur would give @entity23 a run for his money on the dance floor boogie nights : one lemur looked like he was pulling the same moves as @entity31 in @entity7 they boogied their way across the track without stopping and even performed a few acrobatic stunts			1
the elaborate routine only stopped when they reached another trunk and scrambled up to the top			0
the whole dance routine was captured on camera by @entity42 , who was watching the lemurs ' antics with her boyfriend , @entity45			1
the couple were enjoying a holiday on the island of @entity49 in the hope of photographing the dancing , made famous by the animated @entity53 film			2
throwing shapes : the lemurs boogied their way across the road and even performed a few acrobatic stunts the lemurs scrambled down a tree before bursting into a fantastic dance display @entity42 , 34 , from @entity61 in @entity62 , said : ' part of the reason i wanted to go to @entity49 is because they have lemurs there that look like they are dancing			1
' we went to a spot where there were a group of them up in the trees and waited for many hours for them to move			0
' normally they jump from tree to tree but they had to cross a dirt road , so we were waiting for them to do that			1
the animal kingdom 's @entity84 : as they landed on the ground each one burst into an array of dance moves moves like @entity91 : eventually the lemurs came down from the trees and started doing their little dance lemurs love to dance but they do not know how to crawl because they spend most of their day in the trees lemurs are an old group of primates which evolved after @entity49 split away from the @entity100 mainland smooth mover : @entity42 , 34 , from @entity61 in @entity62 , took the photos of the dancing lemurs ' eventually they came down from the trees and started doing their little dance			1
" they are adapted to the trees and they ca n't crawl so this is why they do it			0
" i had seen them doing it on documentaries before and i had always said i wanted to go and see them for myself and take photos			0
' it was very amusing and looked so funny , taking pictures was hard because i could n't help but stop and just look at them as they did it			0
as there was no competition from monkeys on @entity49 , lemurs soon came to dominate its rainforests @entity42 waited for hours for the lemurs to come down for trees so she could catch them dancing ' i was ecstatic to get the photos as that was one of the main things i wanted to do , i was really happy			2
' lemurs are an old group of primates which evolved in near isolation after @entity49 split away from the @entity100 mainland			2
they filled the ecological niches occupied by monkeys , the dominant primates , on mainland @entity100			0
as there was no competition from monkeys on @entity49 , lemurs soon came to dominate its rainforests , until boats started to arrive around 2,000 years ago and human hunters arrived			2
lemur size ranges from the world 's smallest primate to - until fairly recently - some of its largest , the sloth lemurs , which rivalled gorillas in size			0
ancient : lemurs are named after the lemures ( ghosts or spirits ) of @entity161 lemurs use their hands and feet to move nimbly through the trees , but can not grip with their tails			0
