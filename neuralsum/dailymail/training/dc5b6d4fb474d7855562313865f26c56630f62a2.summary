by @entity0 last updated at 2:23 pm on 30th november 2011 a six - month - old girl dices with death every nap time - because of a rare condition that means she stops breathing every time she falls asleep			1
@entity5 has to spend 21 hours a day on a special ventilator to keep her alive in case she nods off			1
she had a tracheotomy just two months after she was born in may in a bid to save her life - and now she has finally been allowed to go home for the first time			1
@entity15 will need to rely on a ventilator ( pictured ) when she sleeps for the rest of her life @entity15 was diagnosed with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome ( @entity19 ) - also known as @entity20 's curse - meaning her body does n't breathe automatically when she is asleep			1
her parents , @entity24 and @entity25 , both 26 , from @entity26 , have to make sure their daughter is never too far away from her ventilator - as a sudden snooze could prove fatal for her			1
the condition is named after the myth of a water nymph , @entity20 , who had an unfaithful mortal lover called @entity35 who swore to her that his ' every waking breath would be a testimony of his love '			0
upon witnessing his adultery , she cursed that if he should fall asleep , he would forget to breathe			0
the term is considered outdated for children with @entity19 , who actually lack an arousal response to low oxygen levels and high @entity48 levels in the blood when asleep			0
around 300 children worldwide and 30 people in the @entity52 have the life - long condition			1
the oldest @entity19 patients today are in their 30s and 40s - @entity19 young adults are in college , in the workplace , and some are having their own families			1
mr @entity62 , a sales executive , said : ' we were terrified when doctors eventually discovered what was wrong with our little girl			0
' she had been born a few weeks premature , and we thought she was just late in developing her breathing			1
' but it quickly became apparent there was something much more seriously wrong			0
' it 's difficult to play with her and act like a normal family , because we 're always terrified she 'll suddenly get sleepy and her breathing will go			1
' most parents probably love to see their little ones nod off in the middle of the day - but for us , it 's frightening			2
' her ventilator is her lifeline , and we ca n't go anywhere without it			0
' when she was eventually diagnosed , it almost felt like a relief to know what was actually wrong with her			0
' but then the full realisation of what that meant for our daughter - living on a ventilator for most of her life - really hit us , and it was heartbreaking			2
' doctors at @entity98 carried on months of tests on @entity100 when she was born - even believing at one point she may have meningitis			2
but it was only after one surgeon who had seen a similar case in another baby that @entity15 was tested for @entity19			1
six - month - old @entity15 was diagnosed with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome ( @entity19 ) - also known as @entity20 's curse - meaning her body does n't breathe automatically when she is asleep the condition is so rare that there are only about 300 cases diagnosed worldwide			1
she underwent a tracheotomy , and was kept on a ventilator 24 hours a day , as her parents watched her battle to breathe			2
eventually , she was allowed off the ventilator for short periods during the day - and is now considered well enough to be treated at home			2
however , she will still have to spend most of her life with access to some form of ventilation , possibly limited to a mask at bedtime when she is older and stronger			0
@entity15 's condition is so dangerous that she will still have to be monitored constantly - including by a healthcare professional who will stay with her at home throughout the night , to ensure her breathing stays stable			1
@entity24 and @entity25 with their daughter			0
she is not attached to the breathing apparatus for three hours a day mr @entity62 added : ' @entity25 and i have both had intensive training of how to monitor @entity100 , and what to do if the ventilator or her tracheotomy fails - we have to be prepared for something like that to happen			1
' her breathing equipment needs cleaning every day , and we are n't allowed to leave her to anyone 's care who has n't been medically trained to look after her - so we ca n't leave her with friends or relatives			1
' but it was an amazing feeling to finally bring her home			0
she smiled and laughed when we put her down to bed - it was wonderful			2
' we 're hopeful that as @entity100 grows bigger and stronger , she wo n't need to be on a ventilator all the time			0
' at the very least , she will always have to wear a ventilation mask when sleeping - but we 're hoping she should be able to grow up to live a normal life			2
@entity25 , a nursery nurse , added : ' we are so grateful for all the doctors and nurses at @entity98 - without them , @entity100 might not be here today			0
' we 're planning a big homecoming party for @entity100 , and we 'll also be running a charity auction for @entity161 , who helped us enormously over the last 10 months			0
' local businesses have been very generous and we hope we 'll be able to raise a lot of money for such a good cause			0

six - month - old @entity15 is *closely* monitored for the three hours she is taken off the breathing apparatus
