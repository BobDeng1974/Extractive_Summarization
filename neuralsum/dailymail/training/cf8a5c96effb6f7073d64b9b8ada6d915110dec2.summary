by @entity0 published : 06:07 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 17:49 est , 4 june 2013 two soldiers who abused @entity3 will have their identities protected to prevent them being targeted by terrorists			1
a 22 - year - old former private was fined £ 1,000 yesterday after admitting pulling a young boy 's hand towards his genitals and telling him , ' touch my special place '			1
his 23 - year - old comrade , a lance bombardier , was demoted in rank after pleading guilty to racially insulting a local man by photographing him holding a sign reading ' @entity16 '			1
but , controversially , the judge at the court martial ruled the soldiers ' names should be kept secret following the murder of drummer @entity22 – even though the military ' should not be seen to hide behind the law '			1
the soldiers admitted the offences at court and their names have not been released ( file picture ) two @entity31 extremists have been charged with murdering @entity22 , 25 , outside @entity33 barracks in south - east @entity34 two weeks ago			1
yesterday judge advocate @entity37 , sitting in @entity35 , @entity36 , said the guilty soldiers and their families could be at risk of attack if their anonymity was lifted			1
' in the light of recent events in @entity34 and the threat posed by “ lone wolves ” , it seems to me that it would be wrong to lift the restrictions , ' he said			0
' i accept that it would usually be wrong to make such an order and this should not be seen as an attempt by the military to hide behind the law			0
' it was made in response to very specific circumstances and on specific grounds			0
' the servicemen were attached to the @entity62 the @entity63 , which was fighting the @entity64 in the @entity67 - e @entity66 area of @entity68 when the offences took place in december 2011			2
the former private , known as @entity72 , who has now left the @entity74 , pleaded guilty to two charges of misconduct			0
in one incident , he was filmed near a checkpoint with a child aged about five sitting on his knee			0
footage showed him laughing , pulling the boy 's hand and telling him to touch his crotch			1
soldier x has now left the @entity74 and was fined £ 1,000 for the offence in 2011 ( file picture ) he also admitted using abusive language towards an @entity3 boy aged around ten who offered to shake his hand			1
he was cleared of disgraceful conduct of an indecent kind and of forcing an @entity3 girl to touch him intimately			1
judge @entity96 accepted there was no sexual motive behind @entity72 's behaviour towards the young boys but said it was ' gratuitously unpleasant ' and ' totally unacceptable '			2
the former lance bombardier , soldier y , pleaded guilty to committing a racially aggravated offence by posing in a photograph with an @entity3 man holding the ' @entity16 ' sign			1
judge @entity108 said his behaviour was ' highly offensive and particularly stupid '			0
military police arrested the pair after complaints from their comrades			0
sentencing both men , the judge accepted the offences had taken place during a ' demanding operational situation with risk of attack from insurgents and a persistent ied threat '			1
soldier x admitted pulling an @entity3 boy 's hand towards his crotch while on patrol in @entity68 ( file picture ) but he said : ' many soldiers develop their own strategies for dealing with the pressure of life on operations			1
one of those strategies is banter			0
the boundary between what is acceptable and what trespasses into unacceptable behaviour is sometimes unclear and difficult to distinguish			0
' having said that , all soldiers , particularly those serving in @entity3 , are fully trained and fully prepared for all aspects of your duties			1
murdered : drummer @entity22 ' you were briefed on the sensibilities of the country and aware of the need to respect local customs and cultures and to avoid any behaviour that could be interpreted as having sexual or racist connotations which could cause understandable offence to people in that country			0
' a third serviceman , soldier z , their patrol commander , was cleared of failing in his duty to deal with the offences			2
the @entity160 are especially sensitive to any allegation which could undermine the work they are doing to win the ' hearts and minds ' of people in @entity68			0
it is the first time that allegations of abuse against children by @entity172 troops have been investigated in either @entity173 or @entity3			2
however , claims that @entity172 troops abused , tortured and murdered @entity173 civilians during the second @entity176 have surfaced several times			0
one soldier , corporal @entity177 , was jailed for a year after admitting he was involved in assaulting @entity178 , a 26 - year - old hotel receptionist who was beaten to death in @entity181 , in 2003			2
he became the first @entity172 soldier to be convicted of a war crime			0
a report into mr @entity186 's death found that he suffered ' appalling gratuitous violence '			0
up to 14 serving soldiers and 12 retired colleagues face possible prosecution .			2
