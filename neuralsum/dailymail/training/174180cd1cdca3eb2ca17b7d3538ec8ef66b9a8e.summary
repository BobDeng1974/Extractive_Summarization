they 're supposed to be man 's best friends , but as these two prove , dogs have just as much love for each other as they do for us			0
here are the pictures which show the devotion of one male dog who spent 10 hours guarding a female who had fallen down a deep gutter in southern @entity14 's @entity13 province			1
the white male 's barking woke up @entity17 , 77 , who looked out of her window in @entity19 and saw the animal standing by a gutter while another black dog cowered at the bottom			2
the male dog 's barking was first heard by an elderly woman from her window at 12.30am instead of helping , the 77 - year old went back to sleep , but when she got up again at 6.15 the dog was still there she phoned the council office who sent a man out to help , but he was afraid to approach the dog in case the distressed animal bit him not wanting to disturb the ' furious ' looking canine , the elderly woman went back to bed , but when she got up at 6.15am , they were both still there			1
she said : ' the white one was walking back and forth , looking at passing people and vehicles in begging eyes , while the black dog groveled at the bottom of the gutter			0
' no doubt impressed by the male dog 's tenacity , @entity17 decided to phone the community office , who sent a worker , @entity55 , out to help			2
the job of rescuer eventually fell to local man @entity58 who managed to gin the male 's trust and fish the female out after his night - long vigil finally came to an end the white dog was clearly glad to be back with his female accomplice the pair were obviously happy to be reunited once again but when @entity55 got there , he was afraid to approach the animal in case the he was attacked			1
' we dared not to get close , as the white male dog looked hectic and quite alert , ' he said			0
eventually the job of rescuing the blighted black dog fell to local man @entity58 , who gained the white dog 's trust by slowly edging up to it			1
after the dog had calmed down @entity81 reached into the gutter and managed to fish the female dog out			2
obviously full of relief for his unlucky lady , the male dog calmed down and after a few moments the pair ran off down the street , playing as they went			0
after a lengthy rescue operation the couple began playing before running off down the road together			0
