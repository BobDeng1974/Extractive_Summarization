when the @entity3 manager might just be the most popular inhabitant of the @entity6 directors ’ box , it tells you everything about where @entity9 are right now			1
even in the annals of the bitter saga surrounding this crisis - riven club , these were extraordinary scenes			2
mounted police stood guard in front of the main entrance to the stadium before friday night ’s truncated game against @entity20 as tensions crackled amid angry protests			1

none of the ire vented on friday night was sent in his direction			2
when a farcical game on a snow - bound pitch was then abandoned after 25 minutes , it provided the cue for another outpouring of ill - feeling			0
no sooner had referee @entity64 ’s whistle stilled than chants of ‘ sack the board ’ rang out from all four stands			2
hundreds of fans answered the call for a mass protest at 7pm - despite sub-zero temperatures - thronging around the barriers erected in front of @entity6			1
it was a response to advance notices of security over the stadium and @entity78 being lodged on behalf of @entity81 ’s @entity80 firm			0
the move is seen as a precursor to the board accepting a £ 10million loan from @entity81 ahead of a rival funding offer from @entity88 ’s consortium known as the @entity89			2
@entity3 boss @entity44 and assistant @entity48 were at @entity6 ahead of the @entity46 semi-final the protest was a response to advance notices of security over @entity6 being lodged on behalf of @entity81 ’s @entity80 firm @entity9 fans display a ' @entity96 ' banner after continuing their pre-match protests during the game chants against @entity81 and the @entity100 filled the bitterly cold air			1
banners tied to the fence across the road spelled out the message further			0
‘ @entity6 belongs to fans ’ and ‘ hands off our club ’			1
much more colourful language was also being aired			0
the odd snowball was lobbed over the lines early on before a point was reached when part of the crowd seemed to surge and the police decided a greater presence was required to ensure control			0
more vans arrived , accompanied by a clutch of officers on horseback , who moved into position in front of the barriers			0
when the ground emptied ahead of schedule at around 8.10pm , a second protest formed in the same place , fans again voicing their feelings against the board in the strongest possible terms			1
this time , a group of supporters also flooded into the entrance to @entity137 at the opposite side of the stadium , filmed on a video camera holding a banner reading : ‘ @entity9 supported by fans , directed by parasites '			1
for a support that does n’t traditionally indulge in protests , the numbers were significant			0
as was the widespread chanting inside the ground			0
it seems the prospect of @entity81 gaining security over @entity6 has achieved the near impossible in effectively uniting a fractured @entity9 support			1
@entity9 fans protest before friday 's match with @entity20 over claims that @entity6 is to be mortgaged off @entity9 fans gesture towards @entity20 ' supporters as a board explains why the game had to be cancelled even the club ’s own in - house fan group has called on chief executive @entity160 and chairman @entity161 to come clean about what is being planned with the @entity164 owner			1
the @entity165 ( @entity165 ) is an official supporter liaison group , set up by former chief executive @entity166			0
the body is closest of all to the hierarchy but has told the board it will never back moves to mortgage off @entity6			1
‘ the @entity165 are today insisting on clarity from @entity9 chief executive @entity160 and chairman @entity161 following revelations that @entity6 and @entity78 could be used as security in return for additional funding , ’ read their statement			1
‘ @entity165 would like to state that we will never support any moves which could see @entity6 , or the training complex used in this manner			1
‘ we have already requested information from mr @entity160 as to the board ’s intentions in regard to the @entity81 loan offer and , so far , the ceo has said : ” at this moment in time , there has not been a deal done with anyone with regard to loaning the club funds			2
we are in talks with a number of parties and , hopefully , an announcement will be made shortly with this effect to the @entity199 ”			0
‘ an announcement was subsequently made but it did not come close to clarifying the situation and that is why we are pushing for a meeting with the ceo and chairman			0
@entity9 defender @entity205 ( right ) tackles @entity20 ' @entity206 on a snowy night at @entity6 @entity207 ( right ) tries to avoid a tackle from @entity20 ' @entity209 early on in the top - of - the - table clash hearts applaud their travelling supporters after having their clash with @entity9 called off in the first half ‘ we need a categoric assurance that our stadium , which is hugely symbolic , a monument to what this club means will never be used as security			1
‘ it is alarming that advance notices of security were lodged with the @entity224 of @entity225 on january 13			0
‘ we must stress again that we would strongly oppose the securitisation of @entity6			1
the very notion fills us with dread and since @entity165 was brought into being to bridge the gap between supporters and the board , we believe it is incumbent upon the directors to meet with us as a matter of urgency			2
’ the strength of those words was telling about the current mood			0
furthermore , @entity239 — a fan - ownership group — have made contact with the club ’s nominated advisor @entity241 to express their concerns about @entity81 ’s powerplay — which prevents anyone else taking security on either asset for 35 days			0
‘ the @entity239 board have written to @entity251 ’s @entity250 to express some of the concerns that have been voiced to us by members over the last 24 hours , ’ they said			2
police and stewards hold people back as @entity20 and @entity9 fans attempt to confront each other inside @entity6 ‘ we expressed our deep concern about a notice of intention to grant security being lodged over @entity6			1
‘ granting such a notice , at a time when shareholders have been assured that @entity251 are currently considering various proposals , seems to provide the party in whose favour the notice has been granted with an unfair advantage whilst , at the same time , prejudicing the ability to advance discussions with other potential providers of funding			0
‘ we advised that we could n’t see how that was in the best interests of shareholders and requested an urgent explanation			0
‘ we indicated that we had been inundated with requests from members to take every possible step to prevent security being granted over @entity6			2
‘ we would call on every shareholder to contact @entity251 ’s @entity250 in similar terms to ensure the nomad is aware of the weight of shareholder opinion on this issue			0
