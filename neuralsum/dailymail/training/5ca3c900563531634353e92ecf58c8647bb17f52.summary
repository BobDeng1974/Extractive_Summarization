by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 04:55 est , 2 september 2013 updated : 19:12 est , 2 september 2013 paternity leave rules which give fathers only two weeks off work are ‘ edwardian ’ , @entity6 said yesterday , as he said parents should share up to a year at home with their newborn			1
the deputy prime minister said he wanted more fathers to help with the ‘ heavy lifting ’ of childcare if mothers choose to return to work earlier			0
in a defence of working parents , he said both mothers and fathers would be able to ‘ chop and change ’ blocks of up to 12 months leave between them , under the government ’s plans to ‘ revolutionise ’ childcare by 2015			2
crazy : deputy prime minister @entity6 attacked paternity leave rules as he met two - year - old @entity28 at the @entity30 nursery at present , mothers have six months maternity leave at full pay , but can take up to 12 months off			1
mr @entity6 was speaking as he confirmed the number of two - year - olds receiving free childcare will double as a government scheme is extended to working families on low incomes			1
from today , 130,000 youngsters - 20 per cent of two - year - olds - will be eligible for funding because their families qualify for @entity43 or they are looked after by their local authority			1
mr @entity6 has revealed that next september , the number will rise to 260,000 , or 40 per cent of the cohort			1
but speaking on a visit to the @entity30 nursery in @entity49 today , he also took aim at ' crazy ' rules which meant new fathers could only take two weeks from work			0
he told reporters : ' we are revolutionising parental leave so it is not paternity leave anymore , it becomes parental leave			0
' you and your wife or partner will be able to chop and change , and exchange the block of leave that presently is afforded to the mother through maternity leave , as you wish			0
' child 's play : mr @entity6 did his best to win over the toddlers , including two - year - old @entity68 at the @entity30 nursery mr @entity6 went on : ' i know plenty of women who feel that they want to go back to work earlier than their partners or their husbands do , that ’s just the way families are , obviously that ’s great			1
' but we ’ve got these @entity81 rules - i ’ve experienced it myself three times			0
' it ’s crazy that when your child is born you ’ve got just a couple of weeks , when in a sense you ’re least relevant to the child , because they ’re barely aware that you ’re there			0
' he said it ' makes much more sense ' for new dads ' to be able to maybe do some of the heavy lifting in those early months '			0
mr @entity6 added : ' all the evidence is overwhelming that it has a very profound bonding effect not just but especially a powerful effect for boys as they grow up			2
' help : under the childcare plans , parents who qualify will be able to claim up to 15 hours a week of free early education for their child mr @entity6 was forced to defend the government 's childcare plans from charges it penalised stay - ay - home mothers			2
the scheme is being opened up to families that earn less than £ 16,910 a year and receive working tax credits			1
children who have been adopted , are in care or have a disability or special educational needs will also benefit from next year			0
the @entity119 is investing £ 534million in the scheme this year , rising to £ 760million in 2014/15			2
parents who qualify will be able to claim up to 15 hours a week of free early education for their child			0
but critics claim funding is not availble to parents who do not work			0
mr @entity6 said : ' of course if we had pots and pots of gold , it would be lovely go give everyone universal entitlement to everything			2
' but we ca n’t , we have a limited amount of money and we have to take decisions and our view is that when designing the tax - free childcare offer that will be made available from 2015 we need to start and focus in particular on those families where mothers – it ’s usually mothers but fathers sometimes as well – tell us that they would like to work , if only they were given extra support with childcare costs			2
' mr @entity6 outlined the overhaul in a speech today , stressing that the government is helping more children achieve a ‘ brighter start in life ’ he said : ‘ all the evidence shows that if you take two children - two five - year - olds hanging up their coats next to each other on the first day of school - the poorer child will already be behind their better off classmate before a single lesson has been taught			1
deputy prime minister @entity6 has revealed that next september , the number will rise to 260,000 ‘ without this help , children suffer and the whole class suffers as teachers have to focus more of their efforts on children who are frustrated and left behind through no fault of their own			2
‘ i believe that every @entity170 family , whatever its structure , background and circumstances , should be able to get on in life			0
’ the free childcare entitlement for two - year - olds was announced in the 2010 spending review			1
from last september , ten trial areas including @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 introduced the scheme , benefiting almost 1,000 two - year - olds			1
speaking at the time , mr @entity6 said that parents would be given the option to spread their free nursery place over two days , rather than three , and to use the free hours between 7am and 7pm rather than 8am to 6pm			2
this was intended to make it easier to fit the childcare around working lives			0
the @entity196 yesterday welcomed the expansion but warned that the scheme would not achieve its goal of giving two - year - olds a good start in life without proper funding			1
@entity203 , chief executive of the alliance , said : ‘ from taking part in the pilot scheme for two - year - olds , we are acutely aware that many of these young children from struggling families will have additional needs requiring specialist one - to - one help			1
‘ indeed , from our experience , we estimate that the true cost of providing such care could be double the amount per place the government has allocated			0
’ he said that the early years sector ‘ fully supported ’ the government plans but was wary of getting involved because many child carers have provided free places at a loss under a similar scheme for three and four - year - olds			1
he added : ‘ the free early years entitlement scheme for three and four - year - olds has been historically underfunded by successive governments			1
‘ we can not afford such underfunding to continue indefinitely and trust that now the government is extending the scheme to this younger age group that the higher costs of providing care to these children will be recognised and fully met			0
’ @entity237 , chief executive of the @entity238 and @entity239 , warned that nursery closures could impede the delivery of free childcare			0
he said : ‘ we are concerned that loss of nursery provision in children ’s centres is impacting on local authorities ’ ability to find sufficient places for the offer			0
’ new research by the @entity238 and @entity239 - to be published this month - indicates that a minimum of 108 nurseries across @entity254 have closed or were never commissioned as they were supposed to be mr @entity237 added : ‘ cost savings have driven nursery closures and this approach reduces capacity in the system which will damage government hopes of meeting its targets for provision of childcare for two - year - olds			1

from today 20 per cent of two - year - olds will be eligible for funding
@entity6 said the number will rise to 260,000 next september
the scheme is being opened up to families that earn less than £ 16,910 a year and receive working tax credits
