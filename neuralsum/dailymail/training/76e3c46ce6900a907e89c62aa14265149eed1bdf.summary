the family of a woman animal keeper mauled to death when a tiger walked through an open door say they still have questions unanswered following the conclusion of an inquest into her death			1
@entity11 , 24 , was pounced on in the keeper 's corridor of the tiger house at @entity15 in @entity16 before she was dragged by the back of the neck into a den and then to an outside enclosure			1
the animal was supposed to never have access to the corridor but male tiger @entity24 walked straight through a door to where @entity26 , from @entity27 , was as she carried out her cleaning and feeding duties in the house			2
@entity11 , left died after she was mauled by a tiger at the @entity15 in @entity16 an inquest jury in @entity33 ruled in a narrative verdict that @entity24 got to @entity26 by entering two open internal sliding gates within the house and then an open door that led on to the corridor			1
systems were in place at the park in @entity42 in to ensure that animals and keepers remained apart at all times through indoor and outdoor compartments connected by lockable self - closing doors			0
but when staff members rushed in after the attack on may 24 last year they found the door to one of the tigers ' dens ajar and not locked			0
two internal sliding gates were also open which allowed @entity24 and his female companion , @entity56 , to move in and out of a light den and a dark den to the outside enclosure			0
the court heard that a bolt on the top of the dark den door - which had been the one open immediately before the attack - was found to be defective in the hours following her death as the scene was examined but it could not be said if that damage had occurred before the fatality			2
an environmental health officer for the local authority told the jury that the top spring - loaded bolt could not be held back and it would bang against the frame when it tried to close , which left a gap of between 20mm and 25mm			2
@entity11 's mother @entity78 , left , asked to leave the inquest while park owner @entity80 , right gave his evidence the jury found that one or more of the bolts on that door extended so as to prevent it from closing into the frame			1
@entity85 told jurors though that their task was not to try and apportion any blame for miss @entity26 's death but to determine the facts			1
a criminal health and safety at work investigation is being held by @entity94 which licenses the park			0
following the hearing , miss @entity26 's boyfriend , @entity96 , 25 , told reporters he had a theory as to why the door to the corridor was open but he said he was not willing to share it at this stage			1
in a joint statement issued with ms @entity26 's mother @entity78 , left , her boyfriend , @entity96 , right , said the family still wanted answers to several questions about how the tiger was able to escape and attack @entity11 he said : ' we will see how things move forward			1
we are aware that the council in @entity27 is still conducting their investigation and it would be wrong of us to say anything before they have concluded that investigation			0
' there are always questions that we would like answered			0
we know full well that we will not be able to answer some of them ever but there is the chance that some answers may come out in the investigation in time			0
' in a joint statement with miss @entity26 's mother , @entity78 , mr @entity96 , a systems engineer for @entity129 , added : ' @entity11 's death has been difficult for us all and we hope that today 's conclusion will help us move forward in some way			1
' while this inquest has been a necessary step and has allowed us to understand some of the events on the day in greater detail , it can not bring @entity11 back to us			2
' our thanks go out to all of @entity11 's friends , colleagues and well - wishers who have stood by us and who have offered their emotional strength to us			1
your support has helped us through this traumatic time			0

the jury heard that she was airlifted from the scene to @entity186 where she was formally pronounced dead			0
park visitor @entity187 , from @entity188 was the only person to see the moment through a viewing window that the tiger entered the corridor a jury at @entity194 , pictured , returned a narrative verdict along with the known facts he said it ' tore through ' the door unhindered and dragged miss @entity26 into the den as she let out a scream			1
fellow zoo keeper @entity201 told the hearing that miss @entity26 had let her into the tiger house shortly before the attack in the mid-afternoon to grease the internal sliding gates			2
but during the routine she ran out of grease and was let out of the tiger 's dark den by @entity210 and then the keeper 's entrance			0
she said she could not recall whether her colleague shut the door on to the corridor after letting her out			0
mrs @entity201 said the @entity217 tigers were locked outside and in the outside enclosure at the time			0
she said it was around 3.45pm feeding time for the big cats but that the @entity217 tigers were on their once - a - week fasting that day			0

park visitor @entity187 , pictured , said he saw the attack through a viewing window			0
he told the inquest that the tiger ' tore through the door unhindered ' and dragged ms @entity26 into his den while she was screaming he said he struggled to get a clean shot on @entity24 and had targeted the top of the animal 's shoulder when he fired his rifle and the tiger darted back into the house			1
in a statement issued today , mr @entity80 said : ' @entity11 was a dedicated and valued member of the animal caring staff at the park			1
' her enthusiasm and friendly character were appreciated by everyone she met			0
@entity11 was committed to the aims of the park , to conservation and to preservation of rare species as seen for example in the red squirrel project she helped to develop and run			2
' her tragic and untimely death has affected all of us at the park and she is greatly missed			0
' on behalf of myself and everyone at the park i wish to convey our condolences to mr @entity96 , @entity273 and all of @entity11 's family and friends			1
' shortly after miss @entity26 's death , mr @entity80 reportedly suggested that it was because of ' keeper mistake ' and ' a sad error of judgment '			1
mrs @entity26 , right , said some of the park owners comments about her daughter 's death were ' ill - advised , premature and disrespectful '			1
she said the comments ' did not give anyone who read it a true picture of @entity11 ' her family criticised the comments as ' ill - advised , premature and disrepectful ' and said it had caused them hurt			2
before mr @entity80 was due to give evidence at the inquest , mrs @entity26 asked to leave the room			1
she explained today that up to that point that only positive comments had been made about her daughter and she was wary that the statement would be brought up and cause those comments to be ' spoilt '			0
asked about mr @entity80 's initial statement , she said : ' i thought it was absolutely negative and certainly did not give anyone who read it a true picture of @entity11 but i felt that everyone in court this week has done that			1
