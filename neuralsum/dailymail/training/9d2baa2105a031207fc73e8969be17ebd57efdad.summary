if i was refereeing @entity5 , i would look to have a few words with him before the game , in public , most likely on the pitch in the warm - up			1

@entity5 is a gifted player but feels hard done by			1
referee @entity13 talks to @entity14 striker @entity5 during tuesday night 's @entity16 tie @entity5 does n't trust referees and there needs to be a mutual respect established between him and officials he believes he has not had the rub of the green from referees when he has been fouled in the penalty area but booked for diving instead			1
because of this , he feels the need to protect himself — that is why he squares up to people			0
he will not back down in a stand - off and he reminds me of @entity32 — a player i refereed more than 50 times			2
while i cautioned @entity32 numerous times , i never sent him off			0
we established mutual respect and he trusted me to deal with him fairly			0
this is what @entity5 needs now			2
@entity5 showed his dark side with this stamp on @entity42 , for which he was somehow not sent off			1
