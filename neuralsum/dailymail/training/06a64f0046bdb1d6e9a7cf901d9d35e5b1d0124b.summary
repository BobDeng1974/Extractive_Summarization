by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:59 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 05:44 est , 30 october 2013 in a speech to leading members of the @entity6 community prince @entity2 claimed president @entity8 's war against his own people was in part caused by drought and mishandling of the rural economy prince @entity2 courted controversy last night by blaming the @entity16 conflict on mismanagement of the country ’s natural resources			1
in a speech to leading members of the @entity6 community , he claimed president @entity8 ’s bloody war against his own people was in part caused by drought and mishandling of the rural economy			1
the prince blamed the same problem for other recent global conflicts , and although he did not name any in particular , many will take them to include @entity27 ’s forays in @entity28 and @entity29			2
@entity2 , who recently sparked division after hitting out at @entity27 ’s ‘ failing ’ pensions industry , said : ’ we are now grappling with all sorts of social and economic challenges that have their roots in a problem not acknowledged , which has contributed to so many of the conflicts around the world in recent times			1
‘ and that is the way nature ’s capital reserves have been depleted ; things we take utterly for granted like water and soils			2
‘ if these deteriorate and are not managed on a sustainable basis , this can cause direct impacts on food and energy security			0
the tragic conflict in @entity16 provides a terrifyingly graphic example , where a severe drought for the last seven years has decimated @entity16 ’s rural economy , driving many farmers off their fields into the cities where , already , food was in short supply			1
‘ this depletion of natural capital , inexplicably little reported in the media , was a significant contributor to the social tension that exploded with such desperate results			0
’ @entity66 , a @entity68 mp and member of the @entity71 public administration committee , described the prince ’s comments about the civil war , which has seen @entity16 ’s despotic president kill tens of thousands of his own people , as ‘ bizarre ’			1
‘ again he is bordering on the eccentric with what is certainly a novel idea , ’ he said			0
‘ he has spoken a great deal about national political issues in the past and it is surprising that he has strayed into international politics which is a very dangerous minefield indeed			0
this goes further than his usual obsessions			0
his job as head of state will be to be above politics and he should use the time until that happens to practice keeping his mouth shut			0
’ @entity2 has long been known for his outspoken views , but by straying into international politics , his speech to the @entity94 in @entity95 may be among his most controversial yet @entity98 mp @entity97 said : ‘ prince @entity2 has always been known for his blue - sky thinking , but i do n’t go along with that analysis of the @entity16 conflict			1
i think it ’s quite clear from the @entity103 what caused it , and it is that these people wanted to be free of dictatorship			2
‘ i ’m not sure the environment is a contributory factor at all			0
’ an aide to the prince told the @entity112 last night : ‘ the prince was making a point within the wider context of his speech about finance and certainly not claiming that this [ the issue of rural mismanagement ] was the only contributing factor to the @entity16 conflict			1
’ @entity2 has long been known for his outspoken views , particularly over issues such as farming , the environment and architecture			2
@entity2 said that the conflict in @entity16 provided a ' terrifyingly graphic example ' of a severe drought having decimated the rural economy but by straying into international politics , his speech to the @entity94 in @entity95 may be among his most controversial yet			1
saying the forum was sign of @entity95 ’s ‘ growing importance as a hub for @entity133 ’ , he added : ‘ you are meeting at an opportune moment and your efforts to establish bridges between cultures and countries could not be more important			2
‘ we are currently confronting challenges that will define our civilization , not least the wise management of our planet in the face of climate change , the depletion of natural capital and a rising population			0
it is clear from the @entity151 and , indeed , from the @entity152 too , that humanity has a sacred responsibility for the stewardship of the @entity156			0
