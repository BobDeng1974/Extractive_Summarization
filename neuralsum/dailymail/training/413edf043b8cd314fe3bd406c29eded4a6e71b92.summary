if @entity1 need any encouragement ahead of what looks like a decisive @entity5 clash against @entity6 in @entity7 on thursday then they really need only look at saturday ’s match tape from the @entity9			1
for a team ranked seventh on the @entity13 list ahead of this @entity14 , @entity6 were feeble in losing against unfancied @entity15			1
even their rather grumpy coach @entity16 admitted he was concerned about the way they had played and , in particular , their defending			1
‘ we did n’t expect this to happen , conceding goals in situations where we had n’t before , ’ said @entity16			1
‘ we started leaving space and they benefited from the space ; they took over			0
@entity28 viewing : @entity16 watches @entity29 leaving the pitch after his late dismissal surprise : @entity15 's shock win 3 - 1 over @entity6 has totally opened up @entity5 @entity34 : @entity15 's @entity35 celebrates scoring their second against @entity6 ‘ the goals are the visible result of a whole series of things that came before			1
as the coach i am ultimately responsible , but there is a disappointment when you concede goals like that			2
‘ we have to improve against @entity1 , recover ground we have lost			2
’ despite scoring the game ’s first goal , @entity6 lost control of the midfield in the second half and never got it back			1
@entity15 were able to break on the @entity55 with ease and @entity6 ’s cause was not helped by some rather lamentable attempts to defend set - pieces			1
@entity60 and his staff will have noted this like the rest of us and it ’s inconceivable that @entity66 will not spend some time on his dead - ball deliveries this week			0
@entity6 have issues with discipline , too			2
they lost defender @entity29 to the @entity14 ’s first red card deep in stoppage - time when the game was lost			1
it was an ugly swipe at the ankles of young @entity74 forward @entity73 and was indicative of @entity6 ’s darkening mood			0
finish : despite their shock win @entity15 must stay grounded if they want to progress , says @entity79 nervy : @entity6 's @entity81 looks on from the bench as his side succumb to an opening match defeat the talking point ahead of the @entity1 game , of course , will be the fitness of @entity90 ’s @entity81			1
without him they really are half the team they can be			0
former @entity95 forward @entity94 remains a willing worker but limitations remain in his game			0
despite @entity16 ’s claims on saturday , @entity81 is still not fully fit			0
it would be an enormous surprise , though , if he does not replace @entity94 in @entity7 , a game his country really must win			0
as for @entity15 , they will move forward with real hope now			0
unlike saturday ’s opponents they benefit from a genuine sense of unity and in 21 - year - old @entity73 they have a striker with a real point to prove			0
loaned out to @entity113 and @entity114 by @entity115 , he will return to @entity74 after this tournament			0
@entity15 assistant coach @entity117 said : ‘ he really wants to go back to @entity74 and play and i told him that the only way to do that is on the pitch			2
he did well today and i think that he needs to perform even better against @entity121 and then @entity1 to have that chance to go back to @entity74			2

for a team ranked seventh on the @entity13 list ahead of this @entity14 @entity6 were feeble in their defeat to @entity15
‘ we did n’t expect this to happen , conceding goals in situations where we had n’t before , ’ said coach @entity16
@entity6 lost control of the midfield in the second half and never got it back
@entity1 meet @entity6 on thursday in a do - or - die game for both sides
