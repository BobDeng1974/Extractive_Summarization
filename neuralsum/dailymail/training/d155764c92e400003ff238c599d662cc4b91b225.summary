guilty : @entity1 's @entity0 once killed a @entity3 goose - but he says the new law has flaws there are no bad dogs — only bad owners			1
that was what i was brought up to believe			2
and i believe it still			2
and that is why i welcomed , with great enthusiasm , the government ’s decision to introduce a new @entity17 and replace the foolish attempt to identify bad dogs with a sensible policy of rooting out bad owners			1
the purpose of the new act — which we should all applaud — is to protect the public against dogs which are taught to fight and kill , dogs which are driven wild by neglect , dogs which are taught to intimidate and dogs which so lack training and discipline that they are completely out of control			1
but the bureaucrats of @entity38 possess a remarkable ability to make even the most sensible policy seem ridiculous			2
under the law , which came into force this week , dog owners who simply let their animals growl at strangers or bark in gardens could be ordered to control their pets or face fines of up to £ 2,500			1
what ’s more , @entity38 has issued a 31 - page ‘ manual ’ entitled anti-social behaviour : control and welfare of dogs , which describes how the new @entity17 works and includes an incomprehensible ‘ flow chart ’			1
the truth is that the document shows every sign of having been written by a civil servant who has never owned a dog and , in consequence , has not the slightest idea about how dogs think and behave			1
of course , it was right to change the law in a way that made it possible to prosecute the owner of a dangerous dog , whether the animal attacks its victim on private property or the open road			1
and the manual , naturally , makes much of the need to protect postal workers			1
but neither the @entity80 itself nor the postal workers ’ union has improved its popularity and reputation by behaving as if every dog is a threat and the delivery of every letter is an act of conspicuous gallantry			1
indeed , the postman i know best is embarrassed by what he calls ‘ all this dog fuss ’ and stopped me in the road to say so — stroking my dog at the same time			1
but the real complaint against the manual is its promotion of so - called @entity100 — a name which might have been taken straight out of @entity102 ’s 1984			1
police , council officers and social housing landlords can now issue these notices that force an owner to take action , such as attending dog behavioural classes , keeping an animal on a lead , muzzling it or having it neutered			1
for it seems that these orders were invented as part of a doomed attempt to stop dog behaving			1
i would certainly qualify for one			2
as readers with long memories will recall , 18 years ago , my then dog , @entity138 , when he was young and reckless , killed one of the @entity144 ’s geese in @entity146 ’s @entity145			1
natural born killer ? buster would have been slapped with a penalty for killing a @entity3 goose ( pictured ) as for my current dog , he spends many a sunny afternoon in what he thinks of as his garden , barking at the dog on the other side of the hedge			1
that normal behaviour — believe it or not — is now classified as anti-social conduct ! i never thought i would complain of becoming a victim of the ‘ nanny state ’			2
not only are my neighbours sensible and civilised people			2
their dog barks back at mine			1
if ever we were both to be prosecuted , one of us would give the other a lift to the courthouse door and the case would undoubtedly collapse			0
under the new law , @entity100 are also to be issued when a dog ’s behaviour is ‘ having a detrimental effect on the quality of life of those in the community ’			1
yet i fear that this law — which has so little relationship with the real word — is open to abuse by local busybodies			0
for , we are told , an order could simply be issued if a dog is ‘ showing signs of problematic behaviour , such as non-responsive to calls ’			1
we should disregard this nonsense about ‘ problematic behaviour ’ as nothing more than @entity191 gobbledegook			0
but the idea that a dog which is ‘ non-responsive to calls ’ imperils the stability of the community is simply crazy			1
most dogs come when they are called — but not always the first or second time			0
whenever i walk in the hills behind my house , the shouts and whistles of impatient owners will echo off the bracken			1
yet my village remains peaceful and secure			0
the next time i take a walk , i shall examine the condition of the village green			0
for the new dangerous dogs manual is particularly severe on anyone who allows their dog to ‘ damage flower - beds and benches ’ and i assume that publicly - owned grass , mowed at local residents ’ expense , qualifies for similar protection			1
if i see any signs of canine carnage , i shall not take the manual ’s advice and provide local officials with details of the destruction ‘ through photographic evidence and witness statements ’			0
you may think me lacking in public spirit			2
but i want to avoid the rest of the village seeing me collect the damning data and making the reasonable assumption that i have lost my senses			0
there are more examples of normal canine conduct which apparently must be stamped out			0
danger dogs : the law was meant to punish owners who force dogs such as @entity242 ( pictured ) to fight readers of the manual are invited to imagine that neighbours of a dog - owning family ‘ are concerned at the distress and safety of their cats ’			1
they may have noticed that they are chased by the dogs and ‘ fear that their chasing is not playful ’			0
no doubt , they are right			0
for it is in a dog ’s nature to chase cats , just as it is a cat ’s nature to chase birds and , in turn , a bird ’s nature to chase insects			2
in my experience , the cat almost always escapes			0
nor does it show any signs of distress			0
it sits in a tree or on a nearby wall — a car bonnet will do — and hisses defiance at its pursuer			0
and all the characters in the little dog - cat drama — up to now without the assistance of the @entity279 and the @entity280 — live happily ever after			1
but the example of the definition of ‘ bad behaviour ’ which riles me most — provoking anger rather than derision — is ‘ a dog running loose in the park ’ which approaches ‘ a group of young children ’ or ‘ other dogs being walked on leads ’ before it returns to its owner			2
to regard that as an offence is worse than ridiculous			0
dogs are pack animals and enjoy — indeed need — company			0
the other dogs almost certainly welcome their attention			0
and it is positively wicked — wicked — to encourage children to believe that a dog is something to fear			2
one of the blessings of my childhood was the lesson , gladly learned , that dogs are man ’s natural friend			0
the child who has not learned that lesson is missing one of the joys of life			0
dogs should be , and often are , a delight to young and old			0
for thousands of sick , elderly and lonely people they provide comfort , consolation and companionship			0
the last thing they need is the nagging fear that if their dog chases a cat or barks too loudly , some officious individual from the local council will knock on their door and warn them to change its ways or face prosecution			1
of course , the bureaucrats will tell us : ‘ it wo n’t work like that			0
’ but if that is so , why have the powers ‘ to work like that ’ been created ? and why not abandon them here and now ? in the meantime , i am worried that thousands — perhaps millions — of dog - owners will feel , at best , uneasy about this foolish new @entity17			1
what ’s more , the nation needs their support for the part of the legislation which really matters			0
it is imperative that we track down — and rescue — all those dogs which have been bred to fight			2
we must prosecute the men who strut around the streets with dogs which they treat as offensive weapons			0
bad owners — not bad dogs — are the proper target			2
but they have to be identified with common sense			0
otherwise the whole operation will be dismissed as nonsense .			0

aim of @entity17 is to protect public from pets taught to fight
but it reads as though none of the civil servants own a dog themselves
dog owners who let their pets growl at strangers could face £ 2,500 fines
and that 's by @entity384 - whose pet killed @entity144 's goose
