it is a stunning example of how beautiful space can be			0
@entity3 bosses have revealed this amazing image of the so - called ' butterfly nebula			1
it shows the death throes of a star , when great clouds of superheated gas are expelled into space			0
@entity11 , captured here in this image from the @entity15 / @entity3 @entity14 , is known as the bug or @entity11			2
known perhaps more appropriately as the bug or @entity11 , this complex nebula lies roughly 3800 light - years away from us within the @entity19			1
it was formed when a star around five times the mass of our @entity23 became a red giant , ejected its outer layers , and became intensely hot			0
its distinctive shape classifies it as a bipolar nebula , where fast - moving gas can escape more easily from the poles of the dying star than from around its equator			1
this creates a lobed structure reminiscent of an hourglass or , as in this case , a giant cosmic butterfly			0

while this image is beautiful in its own right , the mix of colours actually tells us a lot about physical conditions within the nebula			2
the red edges of the butterfly wings represent areas that emit light from the element nitrogen , due to the relatively low temperatures there			2
conversely the white splashes closer to the nebula 's centre pinpoint light emitted by the element sulphur , marking regions of higher temperature and colliding gases closer to the central star			1
this hot gas was expelled from the star and collided with slower - moving gas in its path , creating rippling shock waves through the nebula			2
another example of interstellar art : this image of the center of the @entity19 , an area known an @entity92 , was captured in 2011 an example of such a shock wave can be seen in the well - defined white blob towards the top right of the image			1
other colours identify emission from oxygen , helium and hydrogen gases			0
the observations making up this composite image were taken in optical and ultraviolet light on 27 july 2009 , using @entity14 's @entity107 .			0

@entity11 lies 3800 light - years away from us within the @entity19
classified as a bipolar nebula as gases escape at poles
