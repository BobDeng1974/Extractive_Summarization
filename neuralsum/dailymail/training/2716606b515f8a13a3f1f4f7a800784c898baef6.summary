by @entity0 published : 12:27 est , 10 november 2013 updated : 13:17 est , 10 november 2013 fourteen - month - old @entity1 suffered a nasty cut to her face when she and her older brother @entity4 , two , were playing with a @entity6 tea set a mother has urged @entity8 to rid their shelves of a ' dangerous ' toy after her 14 - month - old baby girl suffered a nasty cut from the rough plastic edges			1
horrified at the cut inflicted on tiny @entity1 by the @entity16 , mother @entity14 posted a warning on @entity18 to alert other unsuspecting parents			1
the 30 - year - old immediately returned the toy to the @entity23 branch of @entity8 urging managers to remove the product from sale			1
but when an @entity8 representative revealed miss @entity14 's was the first complaint he advised they could not take the toy - which carries a warning that it is not suitable for children under the age of three - off the shelves			1
miss @entity14 said the decision ' shocked and disgusted ' her			1
@entity8 has since said they have launched an urgent investigation with the toy 's suppliers			1
determined to do something to ensure other children were not injured she posted a picture of @entity1 's cut along with the toy and warning on the social networking site			1
since it was posted more than 80,000 people around the world have shared the warning , with dozens messaging miss @entity14 to express their thanks			1
the 30 - year - old from @entity53 in @entity54 said @entity1 was playing with her older brother @entity4 when she heard her crying ' all of a sudden '			2
she said while her youngest children were playing nicely together , pretending to have a tea party , @entity4 must have banged into this little sister , accidentally causing the cut			1
' i could not believe it , that a toy tea cup could cause such a nasty cut , ' she told @entity63			1
' @entity4 is two years old , he does n't have the strength to cause such a cut , they were playing so nicely together			2
' i picked up the cup and felt the edges - they were really sharp , like unfinished plastic , almost grainy			2
' miss @entity14 said when she returned the toy to her local branch the staff there were ' brilliant ' , fetching another model to check if the problem was replicated			1
she said : ' the manager said they would send the toy off for hazardous analysis and that someone would contact me back			2
miss @entity14 has called for @entity8 to remove the @entity16 from its shelves after her 14 - month - old daughter @entity83 suffered a nasty cut to her cheek when she was scratched by the rough plastic edge of one of the tea cups ' i am a regular customer of @entity8 and they are generally great			1
i really thought they would take the toy off the shelves			2
' but i did n't hear anything back for ages and so wrote a letter			0
then the managing director 's office contacted me to tell me they were looking into removing it from sale			2
' but when he called back the next day he said because ours was the only complaint they would not be removing the toy from the shelves but would monitor the situation			1
i could n't believe it			0
it could very easily have been @entity1 's eye , she could have been left with her vision impaired			2
' the mother - of - four said she was disappointed when the store firstly offered her a £ 15 gift card in compensation and then upped their offer to £ 50			1
' it is certainly not about getting any money from them , ' she told @entity63			0
@entity4 , two , and his little sister @entity83 were pretending to have a tea party when the accident happened			0
@entity1 - belle still has a faint scar underneath her right eye , where the tea cup cut her face @entity123 , mum to @entity124 ( left ) and auntie to @entity4 ( centre ) and @entity83 ( right ) bought a set each for her daughter and nieces and nephews			1
she has joined miss @entity14 's calls for @entity8 to take the toy off the shelves ' i am worried this could happen to another child and this time the child might not be so lucky			1
@entity1 could have really hurt her eye , she could have caused real damage to her sight			0
' there will be parents out there buying @entity144 presents for their children unaware of the sharp edges			2
' the scarring is still there , the next day we had to take her to the doctors because the cut got infected			0
' poor little thing , she only wanted to be a princess and play with the tea set			0
' @entity8 said they have launched an urgent investigation with the suppliers of the @entity16 , pictured @entity8 told @entity63 they have launched an urgent investigation with the toy 's manufacturers			1
a spokeswoman for the chain said : ' we are very sorry to learn of this child ’s injury and we have made contact with @entity166 directly to discuss her complaint			0
' we can confirm that we have no record of any other reported injuries with the @entity170			0
however , we have launched an urgent internal investigation with the supplier			1
' the toy was a present for mrs @entity14 's older daughter @entity175 , six , bought by her sister - in - law @entity123			1
the 27 - year - old who lives nearby in @entity178 , @entity54 , also bought one of the sets for her 10 - month - old daughter @entity124			2
she said : ' i felt absolutely terrible , ' she added			0
' @entity14 called me to see if i had bought one for @entity124			1
' and then she told me what had happened to @entity1			0
she just wanted to let me know , she told me it was n't my fault but i felt responsible			0
' she has still got a scar , it got infected			0
but it could have been so much worse , if it had been one centimeter higher it could have scratched her eye			0
' i felt awful , i know it is n't my fault but i felt responsible			0
' it could easily happen to another child and that is why we want to see the product taken off the shelves			0
' whether the toy is not suitable for children under the age of three , it should not have such sharp edges			1
children over the age of three have younger siblings			2
it is not acceptable to leave unfinished plastic on the edges			0
' the edges are really sharp , and because there are so many pieces in the set , they are on all the tea cups and plates			0
' the @entity63 contacted @entity6 's press office for a comment but has yet to receive a response			0
miss @entity14 discovered the sharp edges on a tea cup caused her daughter 's injury			1
she said the pieces appear as though the plastic is unfinished the 30 - year - old posted this warning on her @entity18 page : ' please do not buy this toy			1
please can you all share this			0
' my daughter was playing with this tea set with her brother when my son playfully hit her in the face with a tea cup that had extremely sharp edging ( small little sharp plastic bits sticking out of the cups )			0
' i took the toy back to @entity8 and the manager checked another one of the tea sets and found identical sharp edging			1
' after a month of @entity8 not responding , this week i have been in contact with the a rather un-sympathetic man from the managing directors office , they were thinking about removing the product but a day later decided not to			2
' money is obviously more important than safety			0
' to add insult to injury they even had the cheek to offer me a £ 15 good will gesture			0
' my little girl still has a scar and was treated for an infection because of all this and i do n't want another child to suffer so i 'm taking it further as i want this toy off the shelves			2
