a morbidly obese woman put her life in danger by refusing to walk after her gastric bypass surgery - even though she was warned that she could develop a blood clot from her lack of physical activity and die			1
when @entity6 , 51 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , joined @entity10 's obesity series my 600lb life , she weighed nearly 700lbs and was completely dependent on her 21 - year - old son @entity13			1
but after finally realizing the severe impact her weight was having on her health , she and @entity13 decided to make the move to @entity18 , @entity19 , so that @entity6 could receive treatment from obesity specialist dr @entity21			1
but despite claiming that she was committed to shedding her excess weight after undergoing a gastric bypass – saying that she determined to do so for the sake of her son – @entity6 quickly started making excuses to avoid getting out of bed following the procedure			1
at risk : @entity6 , 51 , started crying after she was told that she could develop a life - threatening blood clot if she did n't get out of bed and start walking doctor knows best : obesity specialist dr @entity21 grew frustrated with @entity6 's excuses			1
' i want to see you walk out of this room , ' he told her ' she still has to make the decision to be healthy on her own , ' dr @entity21 told the cameras			2
' if she does n't the surgery will be a waste			1
this is her last chance			0
i hope she takes it			0
' although dr @entity21 explained that she was putting herself in danger of developing a life - threatening blood clot , @entity6 tearfully refused to get up			1
' i pulled a muscle in my stomach , ' she told him			0
' i know you always think it 's an excuse , but if it 's hurting me , it is there			0
' she added : ' i am only on day five of a really big surgery			2
' dr @entity21 reminded her that patients are typically discharged just two days after having gastric bypass			1
' you are making excuses that are not acceptable , ' he said			0
' i want to see you walk out of this room			0
' but @entity6 continued to make excuses for her frustrating behavior , tearfully telling her doctor that he could n't – and should n’t – expect such fast results			1
no choice : before her surgery , @entity6 depended on her niece @entity66 to come to her house to wash her hair limited options : @entity6 also had to have @entity66 give her sponge baths because she could n't fit into the shower slow travels : because she had trouble fitting into cars , @entity6 would travel to the grocery store in her electric wheelchair because she would n't walk , she had no other choice but to undergo another high - risk surgery to put a blood clot filter into her leg			1
and after spending several months in the hospital , @entity6 was finally ready to be discharged – but still refused to get up at her doctor 's request			1
dr @entity21 , who was concerned that @entity6 would end up undoing the results her surgery , noted that she had been a difficult patient throughout her stay			1
' her attitude is her biggest problem right now , ' he said			0
when viewers first met @entity6 she was being cared for by her son and her niece @entity66			2
she was n't able to do anything on her own except ' feed and wipe ' herself			2
' i am absolutely trapped in this body , ' she explained			0
' i let myself get way out of control			0
i feel like i am dying every day			0
' while her niece washed her hair and gave her sponge baths , @entity13 had the full - time job of being her primary caregiver			2
final choice : @entity6 and her 21 - year - old son @entity13 moved from @entity7 , @entity8 to @entity18 , @entity19 , so they could meet with dr @entity21 fast food : @entity13 , who was @entity6 's primary caregiver , can be seen handing his mom the @entity112 order she had requested healthy eating : in order to prepare for her surgery , @entity6 was admitted into the hospital and put on a limited 800 calorie - per - day diet , which included lean meats and vegetables ' i do feel bad for @entity13 just because it does n't seem like he has had much of a life , ' @entity66 said , explaining to the cameras that his relationship with his mom is more like that of a client and their caregiver			1
although she felt like a burden , @entity6 said she could n't stop eating and called it the ' highlight ' of her day			1
@entity6 explained that she had been struggling with her weight since she was a child			1
when her parents had gotten divorce , she often went hungry because her mother was a homemaker and unable to buy them food			0
after her parents got back together and food was readily available , she started ' overdoing it '			0
@entity6 said she began to get ' chubby ' when she was eight - years - old , and by the time she was 17 , she weighed nearly 300lbs			1
she hit the 500lb mark at 29 - the same year she gave birth to @entity13			2
@entity142 changes : dr @entity21 performed gastric bypass surgery on @entity6 , pictured , after she lost 40lbs during her hospital stay help me : @entity6 only attempted to walk once after her surgery , despite being warned that she was at - risk of developing a fatal blood clot repercussions : @entity6 had to have another high - risk surgery , so dr @entity21 could put a blood clot filter into her leg ' i ’ll probably die in my bed one day and i do n’t want my son to find me , ' she told the cameras tearfully			1
' i feel like i ’ve done enough damage to him that that ’ll be the final straw			0
' but eight months after she started her journey , not much had changed for @entity6 or @entity13			2
although she had gotten down to 535lbs , she was n't losing weight like she was expected to			2
she also stubbornly refused to do anything but limited activities of her choosing			0
she skipped several physical therapy appointments and opted to go swimming instead			0
' the pool is safer than the physical therapist 's office , ' she said			0
' if i fall it would be a dangerous situation			0
' while @entity6 was thrilled that she lost nearly 150lbs , dr @entity21 reminded her that she should have dropped at least another 60lbs since leaving hospital			2
getting angry : dr @entity21 reprimanded @entity6 for not losing enough weight since her surgery stubborn woman : @entity6 continuously canceled her physical therapy appointments because she thought swimming was safer slow progress : a year after she had vowed to lose weight , @entity6 was still unable to walk on her own dr @entity21 said it was clear that she had not changed her dangerous eating habits , adding that she was nowhere near achieving the sort of weight loss expected of someone in her situation			1
he later learned that @entity6 was refusing to see the physical therapists who had contacted her multiple times and that still was n't walking			1
despite voicing his worries that she would n’t survive for another year , after putting her body under such strain for so long , dr @entity21 admitted that there was little left he could do for @entity6 if she was n’t willing to make any changes to her lifestyle			1
' she has no intention to change right now , ' he said			0
he added : ' you want every patient to be a success , but that 's not reality			0
hopefully , @entity13 wo n't end up burying his mother soon			2
' @entity6 noted : ' i feel like i am making the progress that i want			2
i do have to take it at my own pace			0
i know i will get there that way			0
