more cycles of @entity3 were undertaken in the @entity4 last year than ever before - but there has been no rise in the success rate , figures released today show			1
they reveal more than two - thirds of women undergoing treatment are aged 37 and under , while the average age for treatment remains static at 35			1
women over 40 represent the minority of all patients treated , with women aged over 45 accounting for just two per cent of treatment			2
the report , from the @entity4 's fertility watchdog , also shows that the majority of these older women are using donor eggs rather than their own when trying to conceive			1
nearly 50,000 women underwent a total of 64,600 cycles of @entity3 in the @entity4 last year , new figures show in 2013 , 49,636 women had a total of 64,600 cycles of @entity3 , more than ever before			1
and a further 2,379 women had a total of 4,611 cycles of donor insemination - also up from the previous year			1
however the overall success rate has remained constant at around 25 per cent , according to the @entity36 ( @entity36 )			0
the new figures also reflect changes in society			0
the number of @entity3 treatment cycles involving same - sex female couples has increased by nearly 20 per cent year - on - year , rising from 766 treatments in 2011 to 902 in 2012			1
meanwhile , donor insemination cycles involving same - sex couples rose by nearly 15 per cent , from 1,271 in 2011 to 1,458 in 2012			1
however these amount to a minority of all treatments undertaken , the @entity36 said			0
the report also shows that the number of @entity3 treatment cycles using both donor eggs and donor sperm has doubled over the last five years , while the use of frozen embryos is now involved in more than 20 per cent of all treatments			1
elsewhere , the campaign to reduce multiple births is shown to have had good impact , with numbers declining			2
having a multiple birth ( twins , triplets or more ) is the single greatest health risk associated with fertility treatment , so guidelines now state only a single embryo can be transferred at a time			0
multiple births carry risks to both the health of the mother and to the health of the unborn babies , with twins or triplets more likely to be premature and to have a below - normal birth weight			2
the report shows that multiple births occurred in 16.9 per cent of treatment cycles in 2012 , down from 18.8 per cent in 2011			1
@entity78 , chair of the @entity36 , said : ' this report offers unrivalled insight into one of the world 's most advanced @entity3 sectors , helping to inform the decisions of patients and clinicians alike			0
' we are very pleased to see that outcomes in most categories are improving each year , and are particularly heartened by the continuing downward trend in multiple births , something we 've worked hard with professionals to achieve			2
' but as well as providing data , over time these reports offer us a unique insight into the changing nature of social norms , whether that is same - sex parenting or older mums			0
' in that sense they have become a fascinating resource not just for patients and clinicians , but for everyone			0
' today 's report also revealed the campaign to reduce multiple births is having a good impact , with the numbers declining			2
multiple births carry risks to both the health of the mother and to the health of the unborn babies , with twins or triplets more likely to be premature and to have a below - normal birth weight commenting on the figures , professor @entity120 , chair of the @entity122 , and professor of reproductive medicine , @entity118 ( @entity118 ) , said : ' it is very disappointing that success rates have not improved , yet again			2
' in my opinion , one of the reasons for the low success rate is an unsatisfactory diagnosis of the male partner			0
' we should test the man 's sperm at a molecular level , looking at his sperm dna quality to help guide couples to the best treatment for them			0
' dr @entity141 , a fertility expert from the @entity142 , added : ' the data shows that treatments such as @entity3 are now very much in the mainstream of @entity4 medical practice			1
' ivf is now performed more frequently than other well - know procedures such as having tonsils removed ( there were 47,141 of those in the @entity150 in 2012 - 13 )			0
' therefore , it remains disappointing that in many parts of the @entity153 is still a @entity154 with the @entity156 funding guidance being ignored and many patients having to pay for their own treatment			0
' however he said the report also shows the continued coordinated efforts of professionals to reduce the number of multiple births			1
' while twins and triplets may seem like an instant family , health outcomes for children are better if they are born ' one at a time ' , ' he explained .			0
