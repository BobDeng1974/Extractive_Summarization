by @entity0 published : 13:54 est , 12 january 2014 updated : 04:54 est , 13 january 2014 savings : families can save up to £ 300 a year by switching to smaller suppliers such as @entity5 an estimated 150,000 families have left the ‘ big six ’ energy giants so far this winter in protest at spiralling prices , experts say			1
customers who switch to a smaller supplier , such as @entity5 or @entity13 , can save up to £ 300 a year			1
comparison websites had record levels of visitors looking for a better deal as the six dominant suppliers – @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , npower and @entity24 – imposed above - inflation price rises			1
at npower , the average bill soared by 10.4 per cent			2
some 150,000 people have made the move to smaller firms in the last two months , said @entity30 , of website energyhelpline.com			1
he added : ‘ we ’re seeing record levels of switching			1
the big six are under serious attack from new contenders			0
‘ the major suppliers still dominate in terms of customer numbers , but they do n’t in terms of switches any more			1
‘ smaller firms are offering credible alternatives that save people lots of money – hence they are switching in droves			1
’ but around half of homes , including many pensioners and people who are renting , have never switched suppliers , energy regulator @entity46 said			0
as a result , some 13million families , including some of the poorest in society , could be missing out on the best deals			0
smaller suppliers include @entity58 , @entity13 , @entity5 and @entity60 - backed firm @entity59			1
the findings come as the government wields market forces to try to keep energy prices in check a typical deal with a big six firm costs £ 1,320 a year , while @entity5 ’s best fixed deal is just £ 1,037 , meaning some people could save £ 300 a year			1
@entity70 has also seen a massive growth in demand to switch , with more than 15 times as many people searching for cheap tariffs since the big six began pushing up prices			0
spokesman @entity76 said : ‘ the vast majority of households have never switched energy provider and as a result are paying over the odds			2
‘ we ’ve still got a long way to go before switching becomes habitual , but it appears as though the latest round of price hikes could prove to be the tipping point			0
’ the government is keen to use the threat of customers switching as a tool to keep energy prices in check , rather than having to intervene directly in the market			2
however , the proportion of people prepared to switch for a deal is still low enough that it has not had much effect on the prices or customer service offered by the big six			2
