scientists in @entity1 are investigating whether seals are being killed by radiation from @entity6 's crippled @entity5 nuclear plant			1
scores of ring seals have washed up on @entity1 's arctic coastline since july either injured or killed by a mysterious disease which biologists first thought was a virus			0
but the bleeding lesions on the hind flippers , irritated skin around the nose and eyes and patchy hair loss on the seals ' fur coats may have been caused by radiation from the stricken nuclear plant			1
harmed : seals like this one in @entity23 , @entity1 , have been found with bleeding lesions , damaged fur and flippers thought to have been caused by radiation from @entity5 , @entity6			1
three reactors at the nuclear plant went into meltdown following the catastrophic tsunami caused by an 9.0 - magnitude earthquake off @entity6 's north - east coast in march			1
now animals several thousands miles away in @entity23 , @entity1 , are washing up with injuries thought to have been caused by the fallout from the nuclear meltdown			0
@entity38 , professor @entity39 at the @entity40 at the @entity41 , said : ' we recently received samples of seal tissue from diseased animals captured near @entity46 with a request to examine the material for radioactivity			0
chaos : three reactors at the @entity5 plant went into meltdown after the tsunami in march which battered @entity6 's north - east coast ' there is concern expressed by some members of the local communities that there may be some relationship to the @entity5 nuclear reactor 's damage			2
' the results of the tests would not be available for ' several weeks , ' @entity63 said			0
water tests have not picked up any evidence of elevated radiation in @entity71 @entity70 waters since the march earthquake and tsunami in @entity6 , which caused multiple fuel meltdowns at the @entity5 plant and forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate the surrounding area			2
scientists from the @entity78 and the @entity79 have been seeking the cause of the diseased seals for weeks , but have so far found no answers .			0
