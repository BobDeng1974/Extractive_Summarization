by @entity0 published : 08:14 est , 20 april 2012 updated : 11:55 est , 20 april 2012 this week ’s heavy rain has not put an end to the drought gripping swathes of the country , the @entity1 said today			2
while the april showers across @entity9 and @entity10 will have been welcomed by farmers and gardeners , who were hit with a hosepipe ban earlier this month , the rain has to make the soil fully wet before it can start to recharge supplies			2
the worst of the drought has been centred in the south of the country - but further north , residents in @entity19 faced a wet walk to work as the @entity21 burst its banks this morning			0
call this a drought ? a damp commute to work along @entity19 's @entity21 , which has bursts its banks in the centre of the city , after days of torrential rain and more heavy showers forecast over the weekend nice weather for ducks : @entity35 geese paddle along the swollen @entity21 , which burst its banks despite parts of @entity37 being in an official state of drought in the capital , meanwhile , stormy conditions last night caused chaos after a rush hour lightning strike saw many trains cancelled			1
services in and out of victoria station were the worst affected after the strike at south @entity48 , near the central @entity50 transport hub , caused a fire that badly damaged a substation , leading to a power failure and serious signalling problems			0
all @entity56 services were suspended last night and some services into @entity50 saw minor delays this morning			0
the wet weather in the past week means that the @entity60 and anglian regions have already had more than 90 per cent of the average annual rainfall for april , while the @entity63 has had 60 per cent of the rain it would normally expect for the month			2
the @entity66 predicts virtually the whole of the @entity68 will get rain this weekend , setting the scene for a soggy @entity71 on sunday			1
runners have been told the race will start amid sunny intervals , but they can expect to be drenched in the afternoon			1
drenched : murky waters overflow in @entity19 as the @entity68 looks ahead to a weekend of yet more wet weather downpour : a bus kicks up rainwater from an overflowing gutter in @entity50 's @entity81 yesterday welly weather : despite a torrential downpour in @entity84 , fashion came first for some even still , groundwater levels are similar to what they were last week , and many river levels remain below normal			1
there are reports the @entity91 in @entity92 and a brook at @entity94 , in @entity95 , are drying up			0
in its latest update on the drought , the @entity1 said rainfall was only likely to replenish groundwater supplies if there were large amounts of steady rain in the next month or two - the chances of which were ' very slim '			0
as the @entity68 moves into summer , most rainfall is taken up by growing plants			1
more areas slid into drought this week , with 17 counties in the @entity110 and @entity111 now officially in a state of drought , and the @entity1 warned the situation could last until @entity115 or beyond			0
rush hour : commuters are helped off a train by rail staff in @entity48 , @entity50 , after a lightning strike caused a power failure at 17.20pm last night while it lasts : sisters @entity124 and @entity125 , aged four and two , make the most of a rare break in the april showers as they pick tulips near @entity130 , @entity131 before the rain : the @entity134 sisters enjoy a few hours of sunshine in @entity68 's last remaining bulbfields , near the village of @entity138			1
sunny spells will be few and far between this weekend last rays : the sun shines over a rapeseed field near @entity143 on soar power station , @entity146 at long last : bluebells bloom late in @entity148 near @entity149 , @entity92 , after drought conditions hit across the country quenched : late - blooming bluebells crop up after dry conditions that have seen southern gardeners and farmers frustrated by hosepipe bans and heavy rain could lead to flash flooding , as dry soils do not absorb the water easily , so it runs off and causes floods , the agency has warned			2
@entity165 , national drought co-ordinator for the @entity1 , said : ' while we ’ve had some welcome rain this week , the environmental drought affecting large parts of @entity9 could last until @entity115			0
' the soil is so dry that only steady rain over the winter will restore rivers and groundwaters , so we would urge everyone - right across the country - to help by using less water			0
' she added : ' we are working with businesses , farmers and water companies to plan ahead to meet the challenges of a continued drought			0
' umbrellas out : anyone planning break in the @entity68 this weekend should take note as virtually the entire country will get rain			1
