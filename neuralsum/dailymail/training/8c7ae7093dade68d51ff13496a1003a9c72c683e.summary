@entity0 has warned @entity2 's rivals that their ' scary ' strikeforce is starting to fire on all cylinders			1
@entity5 and @entity6 were both on target in saturday 's 3 - 0 win over @entity10 , and @entity11 came off the bench to make his first appearance in almost six weeks following a calf injury			1
@entity5 is a doubt for tuesday 's clash with @entity17 at @entity18 after suffering a knock on his knee at the weekend , and @entity22 definitely misses out due to a hamstring strain			2
@entity6 smashes the ball into the top corner for @entity2 's third goal against @entity10 @entity5 celebrates putting @entity28 's men 2 - 0 ahead at @entity18 on saturday @entity11 made his return from injury against @entity32 's men after six weeks out with a calf problem but the signs are there that @entity2 's stars are starting to align , according to @entity0			1
' when you have got @entity6 and @entity5 scoring , and @entity11 coming off the bench and nearly scoring , we 'll be a threat to anyone , ' said the @entity44 midfielder			1
' you want those boys when they 're flying and it 's scary to play against			0
' what @entity6 and @entity5 did against @entity10 , we 've seen that happen so often in the past and hopefully we 'll see that in the coming weeks again			1
when you 've got those lads scoring goals and creating chances it gives the whole team huge confidence and belief			0
' @entity2 face @entity17 having won five of their seven home games this season , and @entity0 believes that @entity28 is gradually restoring the air of invincibility around @entity18 that disappeared under @entity65			1
midfielder @entity0 ( left ) believes @entity2 's attacking trio make them a threat against any side @entity5 celebrates with @entity69 after the @entity71 's stunning strike from outside @entity10 's area ' that 's the sort of standard we want to be at , dominating teams and winning , ' he added			1
' hopefully we can carry on like this and that fear factor will creep back			0
' meanwhile , @entity79 was back at @entity80 on monday despite reports that the @entity83 goalkeeper had stopped training with @entity2			2
@entity85 believes @entity2 have fallen too far behind @entity86 to stand a chance in the title race – but senses danger that @entity91 's team are building up a run of form			1
he will take his @entity17 players to @entity18 more confident of getting a result than in recent years however , and plans on using the same attacking style that beat @entity98			2
' retention of the ball is key for us , you need to show bravery on it , ' @entity85 said			0
' we have shown that at @entity10 and at the weekend against @entity106			0
a lot more teams are going to @entity18 and really testing themselves and see how far it takes them			0
@entity17 players @entity112 ( second from right ) and @entity114 look glum after @entity106 's late winner @entity17 boss @entity85 is keen to attack @entity2 at @entity18 on tuesday night ' @entity2 seem to be hitting a bit of form which is a bit unfortunate from our point of view			1
they suffered at the start of the season with injuries but you do feel once they have everyone back they are going to have a say in whoever wins the league this year			0
it 's beyond them i think but you never know			0
' @entity17 's preparations have been hampered by two injuries to @entity134 and @entity135 , picked up during the 1 - 0 defeat at @entity137 on saturday			2
@entity135 suffered a thigh problem , @entity134 tore his medial knee ligament and will be out for up to six weeks – but that is a shorter period than initially feared			0
' it 's still a blow but not as bad as first thought , ' said @entity85 .			0

@entity5 and @entity6 both scored against @entity10 on saturday
@entity11 returned from a calf injury and could start against @entity17
