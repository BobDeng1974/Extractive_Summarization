@entity0 is concerned about @entity2 ’s plan to install @entity3 as manager , because of the @entity6 ’s close relationship with @entity7			1
the @entity2 frontman is believed to be worried that the situation could revert to how it was during sir @entity11 ’s final season in charge , when @entity13 became @entity2 ’s first - choice striker			1
@entity0 was forced into a secondary role and nearly left the club , feeling he was being frozen out			1
he was set to be named captain for next season when @entity37 departs for @entity38 in the summer			0
but that is not guaranteed now @entity23 is set to be the new boss			2
the 62 - year - old named @entity13 as @entity42 skipper last summer and has even invited the @entity2 striker to join him on scouting trips to @entity46 games in recent weeks while he has been recuperating from a knee injury at home in the @entity6			2
@entity13 was missing for much of @entity32 ’s short tenure due to injury after being credited with tipping the balance in @entity2 ’s favour when they reclaimed the @entity54 title from @entity55			0
the @entity6 has not been the same force this season despite scoring 17 goals , including a hat - trick on his last appearance against @entity61 a month ago when he suffered the knee injury that was set to rule him out for the rest of the season			0
closer : @entity23 moved a step nearer to securing the @entity2 job after @entity69 reached the @entity71 final with @entity72 on tuesday night it has been noted that @entity13 ’s early return to training at @entity76 has coincided with @entity32 ’s departure			1
the striker is now in contention to play in @entity2 ’s final three games as @entity81 looks to promote his credentials for the job after celebrating his first match in charge with a 4 - 0 win over @entity86 last weekend			0
a groundswell of support is growing for @entity81 to be offered the job after the @entity2 veteran was appointed interim boss last week but @entity92 chiefs appear reluctant to consider @entity81 at this stage of his career			0
ruled out : @entity69 ( right , celebrating @entity72 's win over @entity96 ) does n't want to manage @entity2 @entity23 moved a step closer to becoming @entity2 ’s new manager when @entity69 ruled himself out of the running			1
@entity2 are understood to have delayed @entity23 ’s appointment to see if @entity69 would emerge as a genuine alternative or , at the very least , to use him as a bargaining chip in their negotiations with the @entity6			2
but @entity72 reaching the @entity71 final means the @entity106 will probably extend his stay beyond this season			0
alternative : but @entity110 ( centre ) might not be available until late may another candidate , @entity113 boss @entity110 , will also be out of reach until late may if the his side overcome @entity116 in wednesday night 's @entity71 semi-final second leg at @entity119			1
@entity2 will now come under pressure to appoint @entity42 coach @entity23 before his @entity122 commitments begin in earnest with a training camp on may 7 .			0

@entity0 concerned about @entity13 's close relationship with @entity23
@entity30 striker does not want to have a secondary role at @entity2
@entity0 was set to be made captain but that 's not guaranteed now
real in @entity71 final rules out @entity69 of @entity2 job
