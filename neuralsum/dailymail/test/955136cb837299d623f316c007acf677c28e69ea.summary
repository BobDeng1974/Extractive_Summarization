a five - year - old boy born with parts of his brain in the wrong place has stunned doctors by walking two miles every day			1
@entity5 suffers from rare brain abnormality @entity6 - which means many of his ' grey matter ' cells have not migrated to the correct position			1
it left the boy , from @entity12 , @entity13 , unable to walk and talk , and with a 90 per cent chance of developing @entity15			1
@entity5 , five , pictured with his dad @entity16 and mother @entity17 , suffers from a rare brain abnormality he is also highly likely to suffer heart , lung and bowel problems			1
but the five - year - old amazed mother @entity17 when he took his first steps last year and has continued to defy the odds by starting primary school - and he even makes the journey on foot			1
' it was around may last year when @entity5 just got up on his own and walked across the room - we were amazed , ' said the mother - of - two , 37			1
' it just seemed to click with him and ever since then he has been building up from 50 metres a day , now to two or three miles five days a week			1
' his programme says he has to do at least two miles a day and he can even get up curbs now on his own and walk up steps with a rail which is amazing			1
' when @entity5 was diagnosed with @entity39 we were told he would probably never walk or talk - but now he is in mainstream school and playing with the other kids and his little brother			1
' we just ca n't believe his progress			2
we never thought he would be able to lead an independent life , but now there is no reason why he should n't be able to			0
' @entity5 defied the odds to take his first steps last year and now enjoys walking the two miles to school @entity5 made huge progress after he started a programme designed specifically for him by the @entity52 , based in @entity53 , @entity54 , just two years ago in april 2013			1
the centre treats children with special needs and developmental delays and suggested special exercises and lifestyle changes intended to stimulate @entity5 's brain			1
@entity5 was diagnosed with @entity39 when he was two years old , which affects around just 50 children in the @entity63			1
but the determined schoolboy has made huge developments - with his brain function going from 54 per cent to 76 per cent and his mobility increasing from that of a seven - week - old baby to a two - year - old toddler			2
and he now attends @entity71 and @entity72 on the @entity73 , @entity13			0
@entity17 - who also has a three - year - old son @entity74 with husband @entity16 - said : ' @entity5 has made so much progress and that is why i am so passionate about getting this message out			2
' it is hard to think what he would be like had we not found the @entity52 and he still was n't able to walk or talk			2
and he was under a lot of emotional stress			0
' at three - and - a - half he was n't walking or crawling , he slept in a cot like a baby and could n't speak at all			0
' now he does n't stop talking			0
i nearly crashed the car one day because he said his first sentence and said ' mummy i do n't want to go there '			2
i thought there must have been someone else in the car			0
@entity5 's mother @entity94 , pictured with him left , said : ' we never thought he would be able to lead an independent life , but now there is no reason why he should n't be able to ' ' i think sometimes there is a misconception that disabled children do n't realise what they are missing , but it was shocking for us to find out just how much @entity5 actually does understand			2
it is a neurological disorder caused by clumps of grey that did not move to the correct location in the brain during early development			1
@entity39 can cause seizures , breathing problems , joint problems , intellectual delays and other concern			0
it affects just 50 children in the @entity63			0
@entity115 is known about the long term outcome of patients with periventricular nodular heterotopia ' he is very determined to do things now and he questions things when he cant do them			0
' his behaviour has changed so much and i did n't think that was possible			0
' he is so much more confident and independent , and just like a normal child now			0
it is amazing - he wo n't let me do anything for him now			0
' it has been hard work for us , but if it is working you do n't care how much effort or time it takes			0
i think he will have another year or two left on the programme then he should be finished			0
' @entity5 is due to have his fifth appointment with the @entity52 in @entity136 next week - and has visited the center in @entity53 three times .			2

@entity5 , five , suffers from @entity6
means many of his ' grey matter ' brain cells are not in the correct position
