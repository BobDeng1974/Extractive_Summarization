she died in hospital ' @entity7 has shown no remorse and has consistently lied throughout his police interviews and his trial in court - despite the compelling evidence against him			0

' i hope that today ’s result will help them as they try to rebuild their lives			0
' i know that this case will also have a lasting effect on the police officers who went to the scene that night			0
' i want to thank each and every one of them for the compassion and comfort they showed @entity9 , and the commitment they have shown since to help secure this conviction			2

' dreadful ' : the trial at @entity24 ( pictured ) heard that @entity18 suffered 95 per cent burns ' what we do know is that he carried out a premeditated murder by deliberately pouring white spirit over her and setting fire to her			1
' through piecing together all the strands of evidence gathered by the police we have been able to prove to the jury that this is the only explanation for what happened and that he is therefore guilty of murder			2
' it is difficult to imagine a more calculating and distressing crime and during the trial @entity9 ’s family have had to relive the harrowing circumstances of what happened			0
' despite all the overwhelming evidence against him @entity7 claimed the fire had nothing to do with him and protested his innocence throughout this trial			0
' he made no attempt to call the emergency services on that night and has shown no remorse since			0
' however , the jury have seen through his lies and brought him to justice today			0
' i hope his conviction for murder will bring @entity9 ’s family some measure of justice and i extend my sincerest sympathies to them			2
' the judge ruled @entity7 should serve at least 27 years in prison before being considered for parole - something the court heard was likely to be ‘ academic ’ in view of his age and poor state of health			1
