the crocodile 's fearsome death roll is a hunting technique the reptiles have been using since the age of the dinosaurs			0
new findings show that ancient ancestors of the saltwater crocodile were capable of using the rolling tactic to rip flesh from dinosaurs , including those similar to the @entity13			1
bite marks found on fossils suggest that species such as the deinosuchus - known as @entity18 's terrible crocodile - were able to lock on to large dinosaurs before killing them			2
ferocious : the deinosuchus , which roamed @entity23 80 million years ago , was capable of putting dinosaurs such as the albertosaurus in a death roll in a hunting style replicated today , the reptiles would clamp their powerful jaws around their prey , before tearing off flesh by using the weight of their spinning body			0
the hunting technique puts a lot of pressure on the predator 's skull , but a study to compare the skulls of 16 living species and three extinct ones found that it was possible in the ancient and huge crocodiles			1
two of the ancient species - the deinosuchus which roamed @entity18 80 million years ago , and the purussauraus , which lurked in the swaps of @entity52 - were able to use the death roll , researchers said			1
the deinosuchus , which grew to nearly 40ft and weighed up to 18,700lb , was able to even bring down medium - sized dinosaurs such as theropods , which is the same group the @entity13 belonged to , according to @entity59			1
the purussaurus , which was 42ft long and weighed 22,000lb , would have used the death roll as it hunted giant rodents and turtles more than 8 million years ago			2
killer move : scientists examined the skull of a deinosuchus to prove it was possible for the ' terrible crocodile ' to carry out a death roll fearsome : the deinosuchus and purussaurus , shown second and third from top , used the same hunting tactics as the modern saltwater crocodile , pictured at the bottom of this size chart however , the oldest species included in the study , which roamed @entity79 and @entity52 about 110 million years ago , was not able to use a death roll			1
scientists found that the bone structure of the sarcosuchus , which was 37ft long and weighed 17,600lb , could not withstand the pressure the hunting style put on the skull			2
although it was capable of bringing down large prey , the ancient reptile 's narrow snout restricted its abilities			0
to give an idea of how the ancient reptiles measured up to their modern cousin , the saltwater crocodile grows to about 23ft and weighs more than 2,200lb			0
known as the world 's largest and most aggressive reptile , the @entity97 species eats cattle , attacks sharks , and has even killed people ancient skills : the saltwater crocodile uses the same hunting style as its ancestors did in the age of dinosaurs while the ancient crocodiles grew to a fearsome size , researchers believe the death roll move was easier for a youngster to carry out			1
' it is possible that very large specimens use other approaches for taking chunks of meat from large vertebrates , ' @entity114 , lead author of the study that was published in @entity116 , said			0
the researcher from @entity124 added that it is possible the ancient crocodiles just swallowed their prey whole .			0

study proves ancient species ' skulls could withstand pressure *needed* to carry out the deadly move
giant predators were able to bring down *carnivores* similar to the @entity13
