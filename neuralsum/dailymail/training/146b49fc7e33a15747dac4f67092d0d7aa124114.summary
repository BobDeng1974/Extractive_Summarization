two minutes into her 60th speech for the @entity5 , she tripped up over the words ‘ infrastructure ’ and ‘ availability ’			0
perhaps unnerved by her earlier stumbles , she then appeared to stammer over the words ‘ take ’ and ‘ contribute ’ , before struggling with the word ‘ government ’ twice towards the end of the speech			0

a spokesman for @entity49 played down the significance of their attendance , saying : ‘ the @entity12 often supports the @entity3 on state occasions , and his and the duchess ’s diaries were clear on this occasion			1
’ the visit followed the surprise announcement by @entity79 on tuesday that , for the first time in 40 years , the @entity3 will not attend the @entity81			1
