' according to the legend , the protected daughter of a king escaped to the surrounding hills , where she met and fell in love with a young shepherd , ' said @entity54			2
' when the shepherd asked the king for his daughter in marriage , the king refused and forbade his daughter from seeing the boy again			2

the ancient story recounts the tale of a bad - tempered widower king and his daughter in a @entity81 in the @entity82			2
he was a @entity79 , lord of @entity85 and sorcerer , who lived exclusively for his daughter , @entity88 , and who would not let the princess speak to anyone			2
apart from the @entity79 , the @entity67 was raised by an old nurse , after the @entity93 had died			0
as the years progressed , the princess grew - up to be a beautiful young woman and able to attract the attentions of any boy in the kingdom			0
however , the @entity79 restricted her movements to the castle and garden , and few ever saw her			0
but , un-intimidated by her father , and with the help of the nurse , she escaped to the local hills and valleys , as her father slept after his lunch			0
during one of her escape adventures , she heard a song : the music was beautiful and enchanted her to follow it to its origins			0
hiding from view , the princess found a young shepard playing a flute , sitting on top of a hill			0
for weeks she returned , listening to the young shepard , until she was discovered behind some bushes			0
the shepard boy fell in love with the princess , and they continued to meet afterwards , talking , laughing and enjoying each other 's company , until the boy decided to ask the princess in marriage			0
early in the morning , the couple knocked on the door of the @entity131 , and asked the servants to speak to the @entity79			0
very nervous but determined , the shepard asked the @entity79 for his daughter in marriage			0
reacting angrily , the @entity79 refused and expelled him from the @entity131 , and forbade his daughter from seeing the young boy			0
not wishing more ill - feelings , she followed the orders of her father , but met secretly with the shepard that afternoon in order to tell him that he would never see him again			0
@entity88 and the shepard boy cried all afternoon , embracing , and their tears formed two beautiful lakes , one green , for the @entity67 's eyes were green , and the other blue , for the shepard 's eyes were likewise colored			1
