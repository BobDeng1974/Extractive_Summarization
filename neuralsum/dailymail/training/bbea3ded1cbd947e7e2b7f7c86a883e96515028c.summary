by @entity0 @entity2 's tourism board is seeking to soothe holidaymakers ' fears over the swarms of jellyfish being washed up on its beaches this summer			2
according to the @entity11 , by mid-july there were already been 500 sightings of the floating animals across the south west seaboard			1
experts have linked the spike to low wind levels and balmy sea temperatures , which have peaked at 21 degrees			1
familiar visitor : the barrel jellyfish is the most common jellyfish found in @entity23 waters however , local tourism bosses have sought to reassure visitors that the jellyfish invasion is no threat to their safety			2
@entity29 , @entity30 at @entity2 , told @entity31 : ' it 's no different really to rock pooling - you keep your eyes open for the crabs and everything else			0
' it 's part of the habitat , it 's part of the fun thing about having a @entity23 beach holiday			1
' hotspot : tens of thousands of tourists flock to @entity2 's beaches each summer the most common jellyfish found in @entity23 waters is the barrel jellyfish			2
one metre in diameter , it can also be found on the coastlines of @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			0
however , while the barrel jellyfish is considered to be harmless , the smaller , translucent @entity53 jellyfish , which constitutes 29 per cent of the species ' population , can have a very mild sting			0
there have also been sightings of the fearsome @entity61 man @entity60 , which carries a nasty sting , although they are far more rare			0
careful where you step : there have already been over 500 jellyfish sightings on @entity70 beaches this summer and moon jellyfish ( pictured ) have a mild sting with sightings set to increase in the coming months , conservationist @entity73 from @entity74 advised : ' the important thing to remember with jellyfish is that they can continue to sting even after they have been washed up on the beach and are dead			1
' do n't poke them , do n't pick them up - avoid them and allow the authorities to remove them , seek medical advice if you get stung by one , but we are very lucky in @entity2 to have these types of species in our waters			0

500 sightings already this summer , says @entity11
@entity94 *attributed* to warmer sea temperatures
part of @entity23 beach holiday experience , says @entity70 tourism head
