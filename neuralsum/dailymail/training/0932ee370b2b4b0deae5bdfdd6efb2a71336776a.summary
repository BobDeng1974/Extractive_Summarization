' @entity46 , head of dog re-homing at @entity10 said @entity8 has a ' heart of gold ' staff at @entity10 hope @entity8 will attract as much interest as the mournful kitten , who became an internet sensation this @entity68			1

last month , the @entity107 announced a rise in the number of black cats being abandoned by their owners , and attributed it to them not photographing well for selfies			0

' we really are puzzled as to why this still happens but we would urge people to never judge a cat by its colour and look at its personality instead			0
