by @entity1 reporter published : 04:25 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 04:27 est , 21 october 2013 with its fearsome array of weapons , radar evading silhouette and $ 7billion price tag , this is one of @entity10 's most deadly - and expensive - warships ever			1
@entity11 - the largest destroyer ever made - is just days away from leaving the specially constructed dry docks and entering the water			1
equipped with guns capable of firing warheads 100 miles , stealth features , and engine able to generate enough power to run 78,000 homes , @entity10 is hoping it with guarantee its naval supremacy for decades to come			1
fearsome : the $ 7billion first - in - class @entity24 rises from the dry docks in @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 hulking : first - in - class @entity11 is the largest @entity31 destroyer ever built after embarrassing troubles with its latest class of surface warships , the @entity31 is hoping for a winner from a new destroyer that 's ready to go into the water			1
so far , construction of the first - in - class @entity24 , is on time and on budget , something that 's a rarity in new defense programs , officials said			2
the christening of the ship bearing the name of the late adm. @entity24 was canceled a week ago because of the federal government shutdown			2
without fanfare , the big ship will be moved to dry dock and floated in the coming days			2
in action : an artist rendering of the @entity53 which will be one of the more heavily armed and expensive ships in the @entity31 meanwhile , the public christening ceremony featuring @entity24 's two daughters will be rescheduled for the spring			0
adm. @entity24 served in destroyers during @entity60 and was awarded a @entity61 for valor at the @entity63			0
as the nation 's youngest chief of naval operations , appointed at age 49 by president @entity68 , he fought to end racial discrimination and allowed women to serve on ships for the first time			0
like its namesake , the ship is innovative			0
it is so big that @entity26 , a @entity76 subsidiary , built a 106 - foot - tall , $ 40 million ' @entity77 ' to accommodate its large hull segments			1
the ship is 100 feet longer than the existing class of destroyers			1
deadly force : armed with up to 80 @entity84 cruise missiles and designed to back up @entity85 on amphibious missions the @entity11 is so expensive only three will be built resembling a 19th century ironclad warship the @entity11 uses a 21st century version of a ' tumblehome ' hull it features an unusual wave - piercing hull , electric drive propulsion , advanced sonar and guided missiles , and a new gun that fires rocket - propelled warheads as far as 100 miles			1
unlike warships with towering radar - and antenna - laden superstructures , the @entity24 will ride low to the water to minimize its radar signature , making it stealthier than others			1
displacement : 14,564 long tons ( 14,798 t ) length : 600 ft ( 180 m ) @entity109 : 80.7 ft ( 24.6 m ) draft : 27.6 ft ( 8.4 m ) propulsion : 2 @entity113 gas turbines driving @entity115 generators and emergency diesel generators , 78 mw ( 105,000 shp ) ; 2 propellers driven by electric motors speed : over 30 kn ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) @entity120 : 20 × @entity122 vls modules , with a total of 80 launch cells @entity125 ( @entity125 ) , 4 per cell @entity127 , 1 per @entity128 ( @entity129 ) , 1 per cell 2 × 155 mm / 62 caliber @entity132 × 155 mm rounds total ; 600 in automated store with auxiliary store room with up to 320 rounds ( non-automatic ) as of april 200570 – 100 @entity133 rounds planned as of 2005 of total 2 × mk 110 57 mm gun ( @entity139 ) originally envisioned for shore bombardment , the ship 's size and power plant that can produce 78 megawatts of electricity — enough to power 78,000 homes — make it a potential platform for futuristic weapons like the electromagnetic rail gun , which uses a magnetic field and electric current to fire a projectile at seven times the speed of sound			1
there are so many computers and so much automation that it 'll need fewer sailors , operating with a crew of 158 , nearly half the complement aboard the current generation of destroyers			0
' the concept of the @entity24 is sort of a bridge between the traditions of the past and the new world of networked warfare and precision guided munitions , ' said @entity173 , defense analyst at the @entity174			0
' it 's not so much a radical concept as it is an attempt to pull off a full range of missions with a ship that has one foot in the present and one foot in the future			0
' the @entity31 once envisioned building more than 20 of the ships			0
but the ship has so many sophisticated features and its cost grew so high that senior @entity31 officials tried to kill the program			1
instead , it was truncated to just three ships , the first being @entity24			0
the @entity24 will cost more than $ 3.5 billion — about three times that of current destroyers — but the program has not been beset by big cost overruns or delays , officials said			2
the fact that construction has gone smoothly is a relief for the @entity31 , which has dealt with embarrassing troubles on its new class of speedy warship , dubbed the ' littoral combat ship			2
' those smaller ships , designed to operate close to shore in littoral waters , have been plagued by escalating costs , production delays and mechanical problems			0
what you get for $ 7 billion dollars : a guide to the @entity11 's unique features a model of the @entity216 destroyer to be built by @entity26 and @entity217 is displayed during a contract signing ceremony at the @entity219 mission modules that give them the flexibility to perform roles including anti-submarine warfare and minesweeping are not ready , even though the first ships have been commissioned			1
' that ship is a total disaster , ' said @entity229 , a naval historian , analyst and author			2
against that backdrop , shipbuilders at @entity26 have been toiling away on the @entity11 , the first entirely new ship built on the banks of the @entity236 since the original @entity237 was christened more than 20 years ago			1
the keel plate for the @entity240 the destroyers will be a new class of multi-mission @entity31 surface combatant ship designed to operate as part of a joint maritime fleet @entity245 , president of @entity246 , which represents 3,200 shipbuilders , said it 's been a challenging project with a new hull design , composite materials and new technology			1
' it is a radical departure from what we 've known			0
whether the @entity31 is satisfied with the design of the ship is up to them			0
we can only build what they asked for , ' he said , adding , ' i hope they 'll be pleased with it			0
we 'd like to build as many of them as we can			0

@entity11 will have cost $ 7billion when *finally* completed
warship features deadly arsenal , radar and stealthy silhouette
fearsome ship can fire rocket - propelled warheads upto 100 miles
engine produces 78 megawatts - enough to power 78,000 homes
ship is designed to *maintain* @entity10 naval supremacy for decades
