for those trying to enroll through online health exchanges , help has long been advertised as just a phone call away			2
yet the challenge in some states has been trying to get a call through at all , never mind the multiple transfers once contact has been made			0
long wait times of an hour or more have been commonplace in some states , primarily those running their own health care exchanges			1
@entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 are among the states in which consumers and insurance agents have complained			1
@entity21 - pictured with husband @entity22 and two - year - old son @entity23 - has been trying to enroll in a @entity14 health plan since december one consequence is that people just give up because they are unable to wait indefinitely			1
' if i had to use one word , i 'd use '' frustrating '' , ' said @entity21 , a stay - at - home mom in the western @entity14 town of @entity30 , who has been trying since mid-december to enroll in a health plan through that state 's health exchange			1
with a child who is almost 3 and another who is 5 months , the 20 minutes she can spare on hold often have not been enough			0
she estimates she has reached someone at the @entity14 call center three out of about a dozen times she has called , but then she gets passed between different people and can not get definitive answers to her questions			1
' it just seems like all the right connections are n't being made , ' @entity43 said , adding that she believes she has successfully enrolled her children but is unsure whether she and her husband have been enrolled after more than two months of trying			0
@entity43 said she has given up calling			0
now , she uses @entity49 to try to get the help she needs			0
the telephone frustration is just one more obstacle consumers are facing as the march 31 deadline for open enrollment approaches			1
technical glitches and software meltdowns on the federal and some state - run exchanges deterred many people from signing up after enrollments under the federal @entity61 began in october			1
with many of those technical problems solved , enrollments across the country have been brisk since the start of the year			1
yet even with 4 million signed up for policies through the exchanges , the @entity68 administration will be challenged to meet its own projection of 7 million enrollees by the deadline			1
specialists help callers and potential customers find health insurance at a customer contact and call center for @entity80			0
there have been delays and technical difficulties at centers around the country long wait times for consumer wo n't help			1
in @entity13 , an operational review of the state - run exchange 's first three months showed consumers waiting 45 minutes to an hour for an employee to answer , and insurance agents have said they have waited hours to make human contact			1
the exchange 's goal was to answer 80 percent of the calls within 30 seconds			0
' we did not meet our standards , ' said @entity100 , covered @entity13 's chief deputy executive director			1
the most recent statistics , from the first week of february , show the average wait time for those dialing in to a @entity13 call center at about 47 minutes			1
@entity106 , a 49 - year - old truck driver in @entity107 , @entity108 , said the first time she called the exchange , she was told after waiting an hour and 27 minutes that the computer system was down , and she would have to call back			1
she called the state insurance commissioner 's office to complain , and said she did n't get a lot of help or understanding there			0
the next day , @entity118 called the exchange again , and was told the wait time would be about 29 minutes			0
after more than an hour on the phone , she finally got the help she was seeking , but no apology or explanation			2
' it 's very , very , very frustrating , ' @entity118 said			0
in @entity16 , @entity125 complained publicly about spending more than 100 hours on the phone to a call center , then waiting by her phone for hours more for return calls that never came			1
@entity125 and her husband first tried to apply in early october when the system went live , but she only received confirmation they had been insured on feb. 12			0
that was 129 days after she first applied			0
covered @entity13 executive director @entity134 greets more than 250 new employees at a call center in @entity137 , @entity13 , on monday , feb. 10 , 2014			1
the new employees began training to help uninsured @entity13 navigate the health care exchange ' i once waited three hours and 40 minutes to get through to a manager who cycled the problem back through to his subordinate , ' @entity125 testified about her experience with @entity145 , the state 's exchange			2
' the subordinate 's solution was to do another application			0
' wait times for call centers on the federal marketplace that is running in 36 states have been much shorter to reach a customer service representative			0
the average wait time in october was just more than one minute , dropping to 38 seconds in november			0
it rose to about eight - and - a - half minutes in december , when more people were trying to get coverage for jan. 1			2
the federal call centers have about 14,000 employees			0
@entity14 's problems have been particularly embarrassing because officials there were quick to support president @entity68 's health care overhaul			1
gov. @entity166 , a term - limited @entity167 who is weighing a @entity169 bid , and lt. gov. @entity170 , who is running to succeed him , had hoped to make @entity14 a national model for health care implementation			1
instead , the state has had one of the rockiest rollouts of the 14 states operating their own exchanges , with the call center problems coming on top of constant problems with the online enrollment portal			2
for example , some @entity14 residents early on were prompted erroneously on the exchange website to seek help by calling a telephone number that led callers to the owner of a pottery shop in @entity190			2
the disastrous rollout forced the previous director of the @entity14 exchange to resign			2
officials in some states , including @entity14 , @entity16 and @entity13 , have taken steps to address the long wait times			1
@entity16 has boosted its call center staff from 50 to nearly 250 , and wait times reportedly have been reduced significantly			2
@entity13 is adding 350 to 400 more call center employees by the end of march , while @entity14 has tripled the number of call center employees from 120 to about 360 at the state 's call center in @entity206 , said @entity207 , the interim director of @entity14 's health exchange			1
@entity207 said she is optimistic the boost in staff at @entity14 's call center , expected to cost about $ 6 million , will be enough to handle the expected increase in activity as the enrollment deadline nears			1
she said wait times and abandonment rates have gone down since the middle of january			0
covered @entity13 also created a dedicated phone line for insurance agents and counselors , increased the number of bilingual staffers and added an online chat feature to help take pressure off the phone lines			2
exchange officials there said they were somewhat surprised by consumer behavior that exacerbated the long wait times			2
they designed the exchange so people could shop , compare , select a plan and be done with the process in one stop			0
instead , they found that people often had questions after visiting the website and wanted to speak to someone by phone			0
they often called back two or three times before selecting an insurance plan , adding to the volume of calls coming into the service centers			0
still , covered @entity13 executive director @entity134 said the exchange is not making excuses and is working hard to reduce wait times			2
' we 've heard their concerns , ' @entity134 said			0
' we 've stepped up to say we 're going to make it right			0
