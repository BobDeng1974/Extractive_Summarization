@entity0 has admitted he is lucky not to have been sacked by @entity2 owner @entity1 – but will continue to fight for his future by axing senior players at @entity5			1
the under - fire boss has conceded that he is fortunate to still be in charge of the @entity8 , who are joint bottom of the @entity10 after six games			1
and @entity12 understands @entity0 will gamble on his position by making changes for saturday ’s trip to the @entity16 – including dropping @entity17 and handing forgotten man @entity18 his first @entity10 start in 18 months			1
@entity2 boss @entity0 will take some gambles with his team for their trip to @entity5 next up in a bid to improve their fortunes @entity8 owner @entity1 reportedly told a journalist @entity0 would be sacked if @entity2 lost at @entity27 @entity28 spent £ 30million on their first - team squad during the summer but @entity0 is prepared to rip up the tactics employed during the early part of the season in a bid to bring about an improvement			1
@entity35 – the £ 6m striker who was hooked at half - time during monday ’s 1 - 0 defeat at @entity27 – is set to be replaced by @entity38 , while £ 12m @entity39 is running out of chances to return on his sizeable investment			1
but it is the recall for @entity18 – who featured just three times in the league last season – which demonstrates how frustrated @entity0 has become with some players			1
the 25 - year - old was signed on @entity0 ’s recommendation in 2011 but has struggled for form and fitness and has made just 22 top - flight starts in three years			1
@entity0 , meanwhile , will talk with @entity1 this week , although his employment remains safe in the short term			1
sources close to the billionaire insist that even defeat at @entity5 would not trigger a change of manager , with @entity0 set for a £ 5m payout should he be sacked			1
@entity0 was met with a barrage of criticism after @entity2 's defeat to @entity27 on monday night @entity2 supporters held numerous banners calling for @entity0 to be sacked during the 1 - 0 defeat at @entity27 @entity1 does not want to go through the financial trauma of changing bosses and remains in support of the 53 - year - old , despite unrest among supporters who fear a repeat of the 2009 relegation			1
skipper @entity75 , however , insists there is a better mood around the camp compared to five years ago , when @entity28 went down after a season in which @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 all took charge of first - team affairs			2
‘ it feels very different , ’ said the @entity87 defender			2
‘ we have controlled games			0
last time we went down we could not control games			0
despite a poor start to the season @entity2 skipper @entity75 is confident they can turn it around ‘ we have a tight group all working for each other			2
we are staying positive as well			0
we just need three points to take the pressure off			0
‘ i have extra responsibility because i am captain and i take that			0
’ and @entity75 has called on fans to get behind the team this weekend			2
‘ the fans have been fantastic , ’ he said			2
‘ we just have to keep going			0
' we are training hard and giving everything			0
you can see on the pitch we want to win the games			0
the other teams have maybe two chances against us , and they score			0
