the ' broken windows ' law enforcement strategy of aggressively pursuing petty criminals is coming under attack , after a grand jury this week decided not to indict a @entity6 police officer in the chokehold death of an unarmed black man			1
@entity9 died in july after a confrontation with police			2
officers tried to arrest @entity9 based on complaints that he was illegally selling cigarettes on a @entity16 sidewalk			2
the clash between @entity9 and police , captured on video , has stoked a debate over the ' broken windows ' concept that says police should pursue small violations to create a larger atmosphere of obedience and prevent other , more destructive crimes			1
furious : protesters have staged a third night of rallies in @entity6 following a grand jury 's decision not to indict white police officer @entity32 over the chokehold that killed black father - of - six @entity9 the idea dates back to the early 1980s and was popularized by former mayor @entity35 , a @entity36 who governed the city from 1994 to 2001			1
@entity35 's first police commissioner was @entity39 from 1994 to 1996 and @entity39 is in the same position under current mayor @entity41 , a @entity42			0
some say the theory has evolved into a zero tolerance policy that has led to disproportionate responses by police			0
speaking out : @entity49 senator @entity48 of @entity6 struck out against what she called a disproportionate response to minor crimes @entity54 representative @entity53 , a @entity42 who represents a largely minority community in @entity6 , said on friday that he has asked the @entity56 to investigate @entity6 's policing for small crimes			2
' we should carefully evaluate how ' broken windows ' is being implemented in practice and how its enforcement may be infringing on people 's civil rights , ' @entity53 said			1
a @entity56 spokeswoman declined comment on @entity53 's request			0
republicans this week also questioned whether police are appropriately focusing their attention			0
senator @entity71 of @entity72 blamed laws such as @entity6 's cigarette taxes that give rise to illegal sales and other bad behavior			2
' i think , my goodness , do we not have enough violence going on in our community that really needs to be policed that we 're going to go harass people for selling cigarettes ? ' @entity71 said on @entity84 on thursday			0
@entity49 senator @entity48 of @entity6 struck out against what she called a disproportionate response to minor crimes			0
hands up : @entity54 @entity89 member @entity88 , a black congressman from @entity90 , @entity6 , said he views some ' bad apple ' police officers as a threat to his son			1
@entity88 called the @entity96 's decision a ' stunning miscarriage of justice ' broken policing : in the ’ 90s , @entity100 commissioner @entity39 presided over a surge in petty - crime law enforcement on the theory that vigorously enforcing the small laws in some way dissuades or prevents people from breaking the big ones			1
there ’s little evidence that theory is correct ' when you have a man who was committing an arguably low - level offense end up dead because of the use of lethal force , you have an issue , ' @entity48 said on @entity117 on friday			0
police backers say programs like @entity6 's ' stop and frisk ' sets the standard that bad behavior will not be tolerated and has reduced violent crime rates			1
@entity35 : the former mayor built his career on scaring white @entity6 with fears of black criminals last year , however , a federal judge found the city 's use of that strategy constituted a form of illegal racial profiling , and ordered major changes			1
the broken windows theory was introduced by two social scientists in a 1982 magazine article and gained traction in @entity6			1
it posits that poorly maintained urban environments with dirty streets , abandoned buildings and the like attract crime , while well - kept communities are more law - abiding			0
@entity35 , who is largely credited with popularizing the strategy , could not be reached for comment on friday			0
he said on @entity84 on thursday that the police response to @entity9 was justified because he did not cooperate with law enforcement			2
but critics say police have stretched the theory beyond its original intent into an indiscriminate zero - tolerance policy			0
' if the problem is a broken window they should fix the window , ' said @entity159 professor @entity158			0
' but somehow we do n't fix the window , we just arrest people who start hanging out by the broken window			0
' @entity162 , a retired @entity6 police officer , defended the doctrine , saying it has increased the responsiveness of law enforcement to a range of crimes			1
' there is nothing wrong with ' broken windows ' , ' he said .			1

death of @entity9 at hands of @entity100 shows old police strategy that does n't work
the ' broken windows ' approach is from the ' 80s and aimed at *tackling* ' *quality* of life ' crime
@entity100 need to look at how crime enforced in a much safer city in 2014
*daughter* of @entity9 says officers should go to prison
demonstrators *marching* in @entity6 hand out list of demands that starts with police firings
protests came after jury opted not to indict officer who put @entity9 in a chokehold
