as the new mayor of his local town , @entity0 was no doubt keen to make an instant impression			1
and as these pictures show , the 73 - year - old has certainly made a big impact - just not the kind he perhaps wanted			1
councillor @entity0 smashed straight through the front door of his local @entity10 store - just five days after becoming the new mayor of @entity12 in @entity13			1
but this is perhaps not the impact which he was looking to make the veteran councillor is thought to have hit his accelerator rather than his brake as he drove into a disabled bay in the store â€™s car park			1
councillor @entity0 , who lives nearby , was taken to @entity27 in @entity12 for a check - up before being released unhurt			1
mr @entity0 's wife @entity30 , who was not with him at the time of the accident , said : ' i had a phone call from the police , who were the first ones at the accident			1
' i went there and went with him to hospital in the ambulance			0
' she added : ' he 's home now			2
he 's fine and he had an x-ray on his neck and he 's just a bit sore			2
mistake : the veteran councillor is thought to have hit his accelerator rather than his brake as he drove into a disabled bay in the store 's car park shocked : councillor @entity0 , left , was taken to @entity27 for a check - up before being released with no injuries ' he 's gone to bed with some tablets			1
' the freak crash happened just after 4.30pm yesterday			0
mr @entity0 's silver @entity56 ploughed clean through the front door			1
he managed to miss a brick wall on the left - hand side and a plate - glass window on the right			1
amazingly both the shop and his car escaped almost totally intact from the accident			0
dramatic : no shoppers were hurt but the mayor was quickly secured in a neck brace before being rushed to hospital bizarre : the car completely blocked the entrance to the store shocked eye - witnesses said it looked as if @entity75 had pressed the accelerator instead of the brake as he pulled into a disabled bay			1
one woman , who asked not to be named , said she had come down after a neighbour told her about the dramatic incident			0
she said : ' it 's just so lucky no one was seriously hurt because the car has gone right inside			0
' i think they 've probably hit the wrong pedal			2
' another bystander said it was the second time a car had ended up inside the store			0
he said : ' someone has done it before , but that time it was in the middle of the night so there was n't any risk to anyone			0
' role : councillor @entity0 is pictured during the ceremony which made him town mayor last thursday crowds turned out to watch police and recovery services inch the silver @entity105 out - many posting footage to @entity108 and @entity109			1
store staff also took pictures but refused to comment on the bizarre crash			0
mr @entity0 's fellow @entity114 ward member , @entity113 , said he had spoken to the mayor 's daughter and been told he had only gone to hospital ' as a precaution '			1

' luckily enough he went through the doors and not the wall and only damaged the windows			0
