@entity15 searched each name straight away to check them out			1
while i was excited to meet gorgeous @entity18 , @entity20 ’s @entity19 , @entity23 ‘ s @entity22 and @entity21 , it was hunky canoeist @entity24 who caught my eye , as well as made in @entity28 new boy @entity27 , cute 400m athlete @entity29 and @entity31 ’s bit of rough @entity32			1
the dates would take the shape of three minute chats with each man , and i would date all eight across the evening			1
it was a hard job , but someone had to do it ... the eligible bachelors : the boys of @entity23 , made in @entity28 and @entity42 lined up with @entity7 and prepared for their speed dating here come the girls : @entity8 posed with @entity45 and her fellow speed daters first date : @entity29 confident and intense , as soon as i sat down he hit me with the line ‘ you were the first girl i noticed in this room ’			1
after that , @entity29 jumped from third to top place			1
at the end of our three minutes he asked me to be sure i was around after			1
wahey ! after dating though , he spent a lot of time chatting to other girls			1
