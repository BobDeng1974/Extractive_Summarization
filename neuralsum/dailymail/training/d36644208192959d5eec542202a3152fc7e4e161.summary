earlier this week , a charger that could power a device from 20ft away was revealed , and now visitors to the @entity4 have been treated to one that charges devices in just 30 seconds			1
in less than the time it takes to boil a kettle , @entity7 can take a phone ’s battery from zero to fully charged thanks to a breakthrough in nanotechnology			1
it was showcased at the @entity18 event , which has also displayed smart dartboards , a three - wheeled car and @entity23 's @entity22 - style dancing robot			1
but the latest model of the @entity7 phone and charging dock ( pictured ) being shown off at @entity4 , has been streamlined			1
the company plans to make it even thinner by 2016 @entity7 technology was first demonstrated last year , but the prototype at the time was too chunky to fit inside slim phones			1
but the latest model of the @entity7 phone , being shown off at @entity4 , has been streamlined and the company plans to make it even thinner by 2016			1
the technology was developed at @entity36			0
researchers discovered tiny naturally occurring crystals were able to store a charge or emit light			0
the crystals - dubbed @entity41 - are two nanometers in diameter and contain short chains of amino acids called peptides			2
they cover ' cavities ' over an electrode in a standard battery			2
this extends how much of the battery can be used to create a reaction , which leads to a charge			2
@entity7 claims @entity41 can boost battery capacity tenfold			1
at one end of the electrode , the crystals act as a capacitor to store energy			0
at the other end , the crystals pass this energy into the battery ’s lithium at much faster speeds and efficiency than current batteries			2
the technology was developed at @entity36			0
researchers discovered tiny naturally occurring crystals were able to store a charge , or emit light			0
the crystals - dubbed @entity41 - are two nanometers in diameter and contain short chains of amino acids called peptides			2
the experts said they are easy and cheap to make , and are non-toxic			0
the firm is working on using the crystals , which it calls @entity41 , for displays and semiconductors as well as batteries			0
for example , the @entity41 can replace toxic materials like cadmium used in displays , and can be created in a wide variety of colours			0
the technology ca n’t be fitted to existing phones because the current batteries would n’t be able to handle the surge and change in power			0
but the team behind the project told the @entity99 that a number of major manufacturers have approached the company to licence the technology			0
this could see it introduced on next - generation handsets as standard			2
@entity107 announced its @entity109 phone last year , and has been demonstrating the curved screen model all this week			2
an @entity112 - branded phone is on display that featured a similar curved screen , which bends around the sides , according to reports by @entity118 news site inews24			1
@entity7 ( original prototype pictured ) was developed at @entity36			2
researchers discovered tiny naturally occurring crystals were able to store a charge or emit light			0
the crystals - dubbed @entity41 - are two nanometers in diameter and contain short chains of amino acids called peptides however , the phone was only showcased to a select group of people and was built by @entity132			0
@entity132 create screen technology for other companies and @entity112 told @entity135 the handset was a prototype display , and not a prototype phone being developed for consumers			0
at this year 's show , @entity112 has also launched a range of innovative household products including a dual - washing machine , and a fridge within a fridge			1
@entity147 firm @entity146 revealed prototypes of its smart darts and boards ( pictured )			1
when used together , sensors on the dart track its speed , trajectory and location , while the board scores the game automatically @entity146 ' wristband is also on display			1
it tracks the users throw and gives feedback via an app ( pictured )			0
prices were n’t announced , and the firm said its smart products are ‘ coming soon ’ and during tests , it demonstrated that its power pack 80v battery is so powerful it can lift a 12lb ( 5kg ) bowling ball when the pack is fitted in a vacuum cleaner , for example			1
wearables have been a common theme across the event , and there are even fitness trackers for darts			0
developed by @entity146 , the wristband tracks the users throw and gives feedback via an app. the @entity147 - based firm also showcased prototypes of its smart darts and dart boards			1
when used together , sensors on the dart track its speed , trajectory and location on the board			0
elsewhere , @entity23 demonstrated its 4ft - tall ( 1.2 metre ) @entity195 robot ( pictured ) that can mirror a person ’s movements , remember audio , walk and dance			1
it can also be rebuilt into different shapes , and movements are controlled using either an app or by voice the bot ( pictured left ) , which resembles @entity207 from the 1986 film @entity22 ( pictured right ) , is expected to go on sale in the second half of 2015 and kits will start at $ 400 ( £ 265 ) @entity212 recently announced an external battery for a phone that can be charged to 100 per cent in 15 minutes			1
called @entity216 , it is currently seeking funding on @entity218			0
the board then automatically calculates the score the players			2
prices and release dates were n’t announced , and the firm ’s website says its smart products are ‘ coming soon			0
’ another wearable on display is the @entity228 , from @entity229			0
created in partnership with video streaming developer @entity231 , the @entity228 lets owners track the physical health of their pet , while a built - in camera allows them to see the world through their dog 's eyes			0
although a number of the products showcased at @entity4 have been @entity242 printed , the printers themselves have not featured as highly as at previous shows			1
however , @entity246 did use the event to unveil its next - level materials that expands the effects achievable			0

created in partnership with video streaming developer @entity231 , the @entity228 lets owners track the physical health of their pet , while a built - in camera allows them to see the world through their dog 's eyes @entity255 , @entity256 and @entity257 stole the show in terms of futuristic cars this year , but a lesser - known brand also used the event to demonstrate its bizarre - looking vehicle			1
@entity265 ’ three - wheeled @entity264 ( pictured ) seats two passengers and goes 0 to 60 mph in 9.6 seconds			1
the firm hopes to make 250,000 cars a year by 2016 typically , 3d printing uses plastics - although machines have been built that use chocolate and even pancake batter			2
@entity246 has taken this a step further and developed a range of plastic materials designed to mimic wood , metal and stone			0
it said the wood can be sanded , and the metals can be developed to be magnetic , similar to some real metals - but exactly how this plastic will become magnetised has not been revealed			2
it could contain tiny particles of metal or filaments , for example			0
the firm also said the weight of each material is similar to what the user would expect , and they will go on sale later this year			2
elsewhere , @entity23 demonstrated its 4ft - tall ( 1.2 metre ) @entity195 robot that can mirror a person ’s movements , remember audio , walk and dance			1
@entity265 is the same length as a @entity306 , but half the weight at 1,250lbs ( 570kg ) , allowing it to do 84 miles to the gallon			2
because it has three wheels - two in front and one in the rear - the @entity265 is classified as a motorcycle by the @entity316 government			1
the car costs $ 6,800 ( £ 4,075 ) and more than 27,000 people have reserved a model @entity107 announced its @entity109 phone ( pictured left ) last year , and has been demonstrating the curved screen model at the @entity18 event			1
@entity132 has also been showing off a phone with a flexible screen that bends around both sides ( pictured right ) , although the firm said it is not a prototype phone @entity112 also demonstrated that its power pack 80v battery is so powerful it can lift a 12lb ( 5kg ) bowling ball when it is fitted in a vacuum cleaner it can also be rebuilt into different shapes , and its movements are controlled using either an app or by voice			2

that 's close to the number @entity362 sells in the @entity316			0
but @entity265 founder @entity265 said the vehicle has all the safety features of a car , such as an anti-lock brakes , front and side air bags and a steel cage that surrounds the occupants .			1

@entity7 can take a battery from zero to fully charged in 30 seconds
it is on display at the @entity4 in @entity18
the show also featured smart dart boards that score automatically
@entity265 demonstrated its bright *orange* three - wheeled car
and @entity23 revealed its @entity22 - style dancing robot set to go on sale later this year
