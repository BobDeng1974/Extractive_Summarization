by @entity0 published : 21:04 est , 21 february 2014 @entity2 : 08:28 est , 22 february 2014 @entity5 speed skater @entity3 has been disqualified for the third time during the @entity7			1
she ended with a tangle of arms and legs with a fellow competitor on the floor of the @entity13			1
the heartbreaking end of her @entity15 came at the final bend of the 1,000m short - track semi-final when she collided with @entity18 of @entity19 while lying in second place			1
disqualified : @entity3 was disqualified from the 1000m short track after crashing for the third time in @entity23 not again : @entity3 , who failed to register a result in either the 500m or 1500m , hits the wall in the 1000m deliberations : @entity3 , along with her competitor , was judged to have impeded after lengthy deliberations the judges disqualified both @entity3 and @entity18			1
she was previously disqualified for colliding with an opponent in the 500m after crossing the line in silver - medal position , and then for going inside the finishing line in her 1500m heat			1
she was also abused on @entity37			1
standing with her team - mate and boyfriend @entity38 , the 23 - year - old @entity3 said : ‘ my psychologist promised me my luck was coming			1
’ tussle : @entity19 's @entity18 ( left ) and @entity3 make contact during their 1000m race wiped out : the @entity19 competitor went down and knocked the @entity47 off balance devastated : @entity3 had made a slick move into a strong position to make the final before being felled she added : ' the problem with short track is that the referees are always different and there is no kind of consistency because every referee has a different opinion			1
she laughed , aware of how much fortune , or misfortune , intervenes in a sport lived at 30mph on a blade no wider than a bread knife			1
after winning her 1,000m heat earlier in the week , she progressed through the quarter - final yesterday evening			1
measured : @entity3 says she respects and accepts the referees call , but did n't have to agree with it she picks up the story of those fateful last few minutes when , after waiting at the back of the field of four , she unleashed herself with about three laps of the 111m course to run			1
‘ when i saw the draw come out , i saw it was the harder of the two — more like a final — and i was in lane three so i decided to save my energy and smash it at the end , ’ she said			2
‘ i knew if i was patient , i had the speed			2
i was coming around the outside and i saw her go wide so i switched inside and pulled tight and thought , “ i have done it , i do n’t need to win because i have qualified ”			2
' that was all i needed			2
i would save my energy for the final			2
but i got knocked from behind and fell over			2
i thought the judge might advance me to the final — but i got a penalty			2
‘ i have n’t talked it through with him but he said i pushed her over			2
the problem with short track is the referees are all different and there is no consistency			1
‘ i always respect the referee ’s decision but i do n’t agree with it			0
‘ the reasons are confused			0
in the 500 i was penalised for diving up the inside			0
i thought that was what they were judging			0
' this time she tried to dive up the inside but i was pushed from behind off the back of my skate			0
i do n’t understand his point of view right now			0
’ @entity3 , who comes from the @entity113 new town of @entity114 , walked through the tunnel only moments before the final in which she should have been competing took place			1
the gold medallist was @entity119 , whom she had beaten in friday ’s quarter - final			1
not only that but it was @entity122 she had crashed into in the 1500m , triggering the bullying in cyberspace from irate @entity127 fans that almost persuaded her to withdraw from the @entity15 altogether			0
gobsmacked : @entity3 said did n't understand what she 'd done wrong to miss out on a chance at a medal statistics so far : the medal table as it stands @entity3 , who at 5ft 3in cuts a smaller figure than many of her rivals , looked so vulnerable in the minutes after her latest and final setback that it was impossible not to sympathise with her			1
thankfully , support from the psychologist , @entity140 , and the rest of the team had got her on to the start line			0
she did not cry on this occasion			0
she had probably run out of tears			0
‘ everyone here and back home in @entity5 was brilliant , ’ she said			0
‘ i got back on my feet			0
i came out and thought , “ i have got this ”			0
last year i could only win from lane one or two ; i could n’t do it from three or four			0
i did those overtakes , which i am really proud of			0
‘ i have n’t managed that before			0
i had so much belief in what i was doing and to have the chance taken off is devastating			0
‘ i have never beaten @entity119 , never mind skating around the outside of her so i ca n’t describe how gutted i am that i never even got to try			0
’ @entity3 said she would be returning to @entity37 and getting ready for the @entity160 in @entity161 in march			1
