a planet - wide conflict that claimed as many lives as the first two world wars combined would hardly make any difference to the world 's exploding population , according to a study			1
the researchers claim that population growth is so out of control that even stringent restrictions on childbirth , disastrous pandemics , or @entity14 would not make it manageable by the turn of the next century			2
they say the global population will likely exceed 10 billion by 2100 , and even in the worst case scenario the minimum it could reach would be 5.1 billion			1
another @entity21 would not significantly dent the global population ( stock image shown )			1
that 's according to a study by the @entity26 , @entity27			1
researchers say that the population has spiralled upwards			1
it is now more than likely to exceed 10 billion by 2100 professor @entity31 , who co-led the study at the @entity26 , @entity27 , said : ' we were surprised that a five - year @entity14 scenario , mimicking the same proportion of people killed in the first and second world wars combined , barely registered a blip on the human population trajectory this century			1
' rather than reducing the number of people on the planet , cutting the consumption of natural resources and enhanced recycling would have a better chance of achieving effective sustainability gains in the next 85 years , they said			0
there are about seven billion people living on our planet and this number is set to reach almost 10 billion by 2050 , according to @entity55 figures			1
this population explosion is largely attributed to better healthcare and farming practices , with some experts arguing that industrialisation in the 18th and 19th centuries was the tipping point that allowed more humans to thrive			0
however , one social scientist claims the human population explosion has its roots as far back as 2,000 years ago			0
@entity67 , an associate professor of anthropology at @entity70 â€™s @entity69 in @entity71 created a new model of demographic and archaeological data to show when humans thrived			0
in a paper published in the journal @entity77 , he claims that political and economic reforms helped to create more stable families , and therefore enabled more people to thrive			0
@entity81 claimed between 50 million and 85 million military and civilian lives , according to different estimates , making it the most lethal conflict by absolute numbers of dead in human history			0
meanwhile , more than 37 million people are thought to have died in @entity88			0
the scientists used a computer model based on demographic data from the @entity92 and @entity93 to investigate different population reduction scenarios			0
they found that under current conditions of fertility , mortality and mother 's average age at first childbirth , global population was likely to grow from seven billion in 2013 to 10.4 billion by 2100			1
climate change , war , reduced mortality and fertility , and increased maternal age altered this prediction only slightly			0
a devastating global pandemic today that killed two billion people was only projected to reduce population size to 8.4 billion , while six billion deaths brought it down to 5.1 billion			1
the findings are published in the journal @entity114			0
co-author professor @entity115 , also from the @entity26 , said : ' global population has risen so fast over the past century that roughly 14 per cent of all the human beings that have ever existed are still alive today			1
that 's a sobering statistic			2
' this is considered unsustainable for a range of reasons , not least being able to feed everyone as well as the impact on the climate and environment			0
@entity81 claimed between 50 million and 85 million military and civilian lives , according to different estimates , but the researchers say this would not be more than a blip on the modern population			0
pictured is the @entity133 in @entity134 , @entity135 ' we examined various scenarios for global human population change to the year 2100 by adjusting fertility and mortality rates to determine the plausible range of population sizes at the end of this century			2
' even a worldwide one - child policy like @entity146 's , implemented over the coming century , or catastrophic mortality events like global conflict or a disease pandemic , would still likely result in five to 10 billion people by 2100			1
' nine different scenarios were constructed , ranging from ' business as usual ' population growth to highly unlikely disasters resulting in billions of deaths			0
professor @entity31 , now at the @entity157 , said : ' as our models show clearly , while there needs to be more policy discussion on this issue , the current inexorable momentum of the global human population precludes any demographic ' quick fixes ' to our sustainability problems			2
' our work reveals that effective family planning and reproduction education worldwide have great potential to constrain the size of the human population and alleviate pressure on resource availability over the longer term			2
' our great - great - great - great grandchildren might ultimately benefit from such planning , but people alive today will not			2
' professor @entity115 added : ' the corollary of these findings is that society 's efforts towards sustainability would be directed more productively towards reducing our impact as much as possible through technological and social innovation			1

another world war would not significantly dent the global population
that 's according to a study by the @entity26 , @entity27
researchers say that the population has spiralled upwards
it is now more than likely to exceed 10 billion by 2100
and even a global pandemic or conflict that killed six billion people today would still see the population reach more than five billion in 2100
experts say we need to cut resource consumption to control the population
' roughly 14 per cent of all the human beings that have ever existed are still alive today . that 's a sobering statistic , ' said study 's professor @entity115
