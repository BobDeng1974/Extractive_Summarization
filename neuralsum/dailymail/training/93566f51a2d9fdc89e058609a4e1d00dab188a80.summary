the mother - of - two said : ' i am just waiting for this transplant			1
' i could not believe it			0
i just hope the @entity38 can get them the visas			0
' when i think about my situation , how can i relax and concentrate on my chemotherapy ? it is not easy			0
' mrs @entity6 's devastated daughter @entity44 , 24 , said : ' we were all so positive , and thought mum would be having her transplant			1
' everyone is so angry - she will die if she does n't get this transplant			1
' she needs it within four weeks			0
' the chance of us finding an unrelated donor is almost zero - there is a real shortage of @entity57 donors			1
' i ca n't describe what we have been going through			0
' when my mother asks me if she is going to die , it kills me inside and out			2

consultant haemotologist dr @entity89 wrote to the embassy saying : ' in order to cure her leukaemia she is in need of a bone marrow transplant ; without it she may die			1
' it is imperative you allow her siblings to travel to the @entity5 to have further testing to establish which one is likely to be the best donor for her			2
' @entity102 has an aggressive form of acute myeloid leukaemia which is incurable without a transplant			2
' she is lucky enough to have three siblings who are a match			2
' but they need to donate stem cells as soon as possible so she can proceed with a potentially curable treatment			0
' yet , astonishingly , an immigration officer told the brothers in a letter : ' i am not satisfied you are a genuine visitor to the @entity5 or that you intend to leave the @entity5 on completion of your proposed visit			0
