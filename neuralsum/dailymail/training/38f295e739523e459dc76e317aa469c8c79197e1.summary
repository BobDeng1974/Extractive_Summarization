it is doubtful that many visitors to @entity2 – attracted , perhaps , by horse - racing at @entity4 or polo at @entity6 – give @entity7 a second glance			1
they probably mark it down as just another quaint , chocolate - box village , full of @entity13 cottages , where nothing more exciting than the @entity16 fete ever disturbs the peace			1
but they ’d be wrong			2
for this is a place where all is not as it seems			2
for one thing , every house in one 50 - acre patch of the village is an ingenious fake			1
@entity7 was also the scene of a royal intrigue			1
while most builders of the period constructed new homes with slate roofs and light interiors , @entity43 built his with thatched roofs and walls of whitewashed slurry			1
the rooms were small with tiny windows , water came from outside wells , and he eschewed modern plumbing			2
curiously , these cottages sold like hot cakes , snapped up as weekend boltholes by @entity43 ’s chums in @entity61			2
the locals , meanwhile , thought @entity43 quite mad			2
when the thatch on some of his cottages caught fire , they stood around laughing			2
as for the @entity69 link , it was in one of these so - called @entity43 cottages – @entity72 – that princess @entity73 carried out a bizarre love affair			1
by 1967 , her marriage to @entity76 was foundering			0
in february that year , @entity76 went to @entity77 and @entity73 visited @entity78 , an aristocrat and nightclub pianist who had previously been married to @entity80			1
she is now the wife of former @entity82 leader @entity81			0
big home : @entity84 is two separate cottages which is connected through a corridor described by @entity87 as ‘ a harmless loon with a slight but well - bred talent to amuse ’ , @entity78 is said to have played the piano to @entity73 at @entity72 in the nude			1
today , the episode is seldom mentioned			0
however , @entity43 cottages are a subject on every estate agent ’s lips			0
once seen as follies , they have now all been lavishly updated and scores of would - be buyers wait patiently for one to come on the market			1
@entity102 – the one that @entity43 built for himself – is one such property , currently for sale for £ 1.5 million			1
typically , there is a story behind it			0
‘ what you have here is actually two cottages , ’ says owner @entity109 , 68 , a retired head teacher as she shows me around			0
‘ @entity43 lived here with his wife , @entity116 , but they fell out			0
rather than split up , he built another cottage for her , which is joined to the main house by a corridor , so they lived together , yet apart			1
’ when @entity109 and her partner , @entity123 , 75 , moved into @entity102 seven years ago , it was in a rather sorry state			0
royal affair : princess @entity73 had a love affair with @entity78 , an aristocrat and nightclub pianist who lived in @entity7 , in 1967 there was an ancient shag - pile carpet in the hall , where old - fashioned regency striped wallpaper covered every surface , including the cupboards			1
the kitchen was dark thanks to its low ceiling , and there was a 1970s - style brown suite in the bathroom			1
the couple undertook a seven - month renovation project costing about £ 50,000			2
in the kitchen , the oak units were repainted , granite worktops were installed , and a roof lantern was then added to make the room much lighter			0
the entrance hall was made bright and cheerful , the beamed drawing room was smartened up , and instead of a labyrinth of small rooms upstairs , the layout was reconfigured to make a logical spread of six bedrooms , four with en suite bathrooms			0
both @entity109 and @entity123 have been married before , and the house is big enough for their four children and ten grandchildren when they visit			0
indeed , last year , they managed to entertain 25 friends and family on @entity162			0
there is a twinkling swimming pool outside , but @entity109 ’s favourite spot is undoubtedly the terrace overlooking the lawn			1
‘ this has been carefully sited to get the sun from the east at coffee time in the morning and again when it ’s time for evening @entity174 , ’ she says with a smile			0
‘ @entity43 was not the fool everyone thought he was			0
’ @entity176 and @entity177 , 01403 246790			0
