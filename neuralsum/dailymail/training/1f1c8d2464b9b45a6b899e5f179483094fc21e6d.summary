by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:01 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 17:46 est , 5 july 2013 suspended : @entity3 's office manager @entity2 had been set to stand for @entity4 the woman at the centre of @entity4 ’s vote - rigging scandal has denied committing identity fraud to ensure she would stand in the next general election			1
trade union @entity10 is accused of signing up people to the @entity4 in @entity12 to guarantee that its preferred candidate , @entity2 , would stand for the constituency in 2015			1
the flame - haired mother - of - two has been suspended along with @entity17 , chairman of the @entity12 constituency party , while the allegations are investigated			1
the controversy led @entity4 mp @entity3 to resign this week from his role as the head of the party ’s election campaign			1
however , last night miss @entity2 , 49 , who had been mr @entity3 ’s office manager , strongly denied allegations of corruption , stressing : ‘ i have n’t done anything			1
’ when asked if she had signed voters up to the @entity30 without their consent , she replied : ‘ no , absolutely not true			1
’ she added : ‘ i do n’t know what the allegations are			1
until i know what the allegations are it would be inappropriate to try and defend myself			2
‘ i ’ll follow the discipline of the union			2
i ’ll comply with what the party needs from me			2
that ’s as much as i can say			2
’ it is alleged that @entity43 and mr @entity17 made local voters members of the constituency party and paid their membership fees , all without their consent			1
a @entity4 source said at least seven people in @entity12 were ‘ shocked ’ to discover they were listed as members , giving them the right to vote on who would be the town ’s candidate in the general election			1
suspicions were raised when the union allegedly sent a single cheque to cover the membership fees for several new members , rather than leaving the individuals to set up a direct debit			2
around 120 new members had signed up within a matter of months			1
@entity64 owes his election as @entity66 in part to @entity10 and its network of supporters – and he remains dependent on its financial muscle			2
in july 2010 , @entity10 ’s political committee voted to endorse mr @entity64 for the leadership and in august the union ’s then joint leaders @entity74 and @entity77 urged @entity10 members eligible to vote in the leadership election to back him			2
behind the scenes the then @entity10 political director @entity81 , a former spin doctor for @entity82 , worked closely with @entity3 , who resigned this week , to persuade mps to back him			1
@entity10 broke the spirit of the election rules by including a leaflet pledging its support for mr @entity64 along with the ballot papers sent to its 950,000 members eligible to vote			2
mr @entity64 won 47,439 votes from @entity10 members , more than double any other candidate			2
in total , he won 60 per cent of trade union votes			2
since his election , @entity10 has given the party more than £ 8.4 million			2
since ‘ @entity102 ’ @entity100 ( pictured above ) took charge of @entity10 , the union has published a @entity103 to ‘ win a @entity4 government which will govern			2
towards a socialism for the @entity106 ’			0
it has also run a grassroots campaign to ‘ grow @entity10 membership in local @entity4 parties ’			0
@entity4 has announced the end of its scheme that allowed unions to pay new members ’ subscriptions for one year , admitting it was ‘ open to abuse ’			0
miss @entity2 , who had been the front - runner for the candidacy , is now banned from standing in the 2015 election until an inquiry is held			1
she will not appear on the constituency ’s all - women @entity122 night she insisted she would ‘ comply fully ’ with the investigation			1
the daughter of an electrician , miss @entity2 worked as a nurse in her native @entity127 , and later became a branch secretary for @entity129			1
she left in 2006 after a decade at the helm of the community health branch , accusing the union of ‘ bullying and harassment ’			0
she then then became a trade union representative for petrochemicals firm @entity136			0
she married television engineer @entity137 in 1991			0
the couple had two children – @entity140 , 17 and @entity141 , 16 – but are now understood to be living apart			0
mr @entity137 was previously married to @entity142 @entity143 , a member of the @entity144			0
both declined to comment yesterday			0
in january , miss @entity2 posted a photograph of @entity147 on her @entity149 page , with the words : ‘ having a party when she dies			1
’ the @entity149 account was deactivated when she was challenged about the remarks , made just three months before the former prime minister passed away			0
miss @entity2 is understood to split her time between a flat in @entity127 ’s city centre , a home in @entity12 , and @entity159			1
she is said to be close to @entity10 boss @entity100 , a former flatmate of mr @entity3			1
mr @entity100 says the claims of corruption in @entity12 are part of a ‘ behind - the - scenes smear campaign ’			1
however , shadow defence secretary @entity164 said @entity10 has ‘ well and truly overstepped the mark ’ for candidate selection			0
by @entity167 is this right ? labour leader @entity64 has been offering free memberships to union members @entity64 has been trying to lure unionists to sign up for free @entity171 was caught on video offering a years ’s free membership to his party to union members who agree to take out a direct debit			0
yesterday the @entity177 revealed how anyone who wants to stand for the @entity4 in any election now has to be a member of a trade union			1
this criteria was beefed up by mr @entity64 in the @entity4 rule book in 2011			0
the wording was changed from saying that anyone who wanted to stand for office as a @entity4 candidate ‘ should ’ be a union member to ‘ shall ’ be a union member ‘ affiliated to the @entity189 ’			1
aspiring candidates must also contribute to the union ’s political fund			0
the rule book says : ‘ as well as demanding that anyone who wants to be a candidate must ‘ have continuous membership of the party for at least 12 months ’ , he or she must ‘ also be a member of a trade union affiliated to the @entity189 or considered by the @entity195 ( @entity195 ) as a bona fide trade union and contribute to the political fund of that union ’			0
@entity4 insists that this change was ‘ grammatical ’ or ‘ technical adjustment ’ and merely confirmed what had been an ‘ assumption ’ for 15 years			0
but yesterday the @entity210 also seized the fact mr @entity64 has appeared in a video advertisement on shopworkers ’ union @entity216 ’s website , where one year ’s free @entity4 membership is offered to members who sign up with a direct debit			0
visitors to the site are told that they can ‘ put your point of view at meetings and policy forums that help decide @entity4 ’s policies ’			0
diktat : @entity4 rulebook showing how officials changed wording to harden up trade union requirement crucially , members are also encouraged to sign up to @entity4 so they can ‘ vote in the selection of all your @entity4 candidates ( after six month ’s membership ) or stand as a @entity4 candidate yourself ( after one year ’s membership ) ’			1
in the advert , mr @entity64 then urges trade unionists to ‘ please join us in this mission ’ to make society ‘ fairer , more just and equal ’			0
@entity244 , the @entity245 chairman , said : ‘ @entity64 claims he was in the dark about @entity100 ’s takeover of the @entity4 , and the secret block - buying of @entity4 memberships			1
but there is literally a video of @entity64 on a trade union website , which advertises these kinds of mass schemes			0
he ’s been caught red - handed			1
‘ @entity64 is too weak to lead his party			0
he ’s too weak to run the country			0
so will @entity64 now come clean , and admit that this scandal goes far wider than just @entity12 , and that he knew about it all along ? @entity10 ’s political strategy document boasted that it wanted to secure 41 seats for candidates that shared its left - wing values			1
so far , eight of those have been selected with many more contests still to run			0
but a spokesman for mr @entity64 said that @entity4 made no secret of wanting ‘ ordinary working men and women to join the party ’			0
he added that the scheme to sign up trade union members – @entity272 – had been devised under @entity273			0
‘ that scheme was stopped when we realised it was being abused , ’ he said , adding it was ‘ very different to being unwittingly signed up as a member of the party without your knowledge ’			1
the spokesman also played down the tightening up of language decreeing that @entity4 candidates ‘ shall ’ be trade union officials , saying it was a ‘ technical ’ adjustment .			0

@entity2 has been suspended amid claims she committed identity fraud
