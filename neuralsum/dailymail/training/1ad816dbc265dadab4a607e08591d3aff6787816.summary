@entity0 buried the ghost of their first - ever defeat to @entity4 two years ago with a hard - earned but comfortable five - try victory in @entity6			1
it was far from the most convincing display by the @entity9 in this historic first test match at @entity11 , with penalties and handling errors hindering their first half efforts , but set - piece dominance and a return to simple basics in the second half led to three second half scores that proved too much for the @entity4			2
the first half was a frustrating affair , @entity0 seeking to ignite the fast - paced , ambitious attack that new head coach @entity23 has sought to inculcate in the side			1
but a penalty count that rose to nine by half - time and a series of passing and catching errors stymied momentum , and also allowed @entity4 to show their threat			1
@entity0 centre @entity32 dives over for his side 's second try at @entity11 in @entity6 @entity0 fullback @entity36 crosses for @entity0 's third try as the @entity4 begin to tire @entity0 and @entity41 prop @entity40 powers over for another touchdown for the home side the @entity44 had in young stand - off @entity45 , who plays for @entity48 province @entity47 , an accurate goal - kicker and he punished @entity9 failings with four penalties that had @entity4 12 - 7 ahead by the half - hour mark			1
the @entity9 had responded to going behind to @entity45 ’s first strike after ten minutes , by scoring the game ’s first try			0
it came from a series of lineout drives which provoked the @entity4 forwards into illegal darts into the side			0
it earned skipper @entity61 a yellow card after two infringements and the tourists did not get the message as they infringed twice more before @entity0 made them pay on the scoreboard when @entity67 , the openside flanker , crashed over the line after a fourth successive drive			2
@entity4 's fly half @entity45 fires over a penalty for the visitors in the first half @entity4 centre @entity74 is wrapped up in a double tackle from @entity77 ( left ) and @entity32 @entity4 hooker @entity78 makes a powerful carry but @entity0 flanker @entity67 halts his progress however , though down to 14 men , @entity4 responded with two more @entity45 penalties as the @entity9 struggled to hold onto ball and allowed the @entity4 to make ground too easily			1
centre @entity32 then incurred the wrath of the officials for a tackle then turned @entity4 full - back @entity89 on his head			1
@entity32 received a yellow card and while it was not a terrible tackle @entity89 ’s feet did fly up above his shoulders , and he required treatment , and so was fair			0
with @entity32 missing , the @entity9 back line messed up an attack out of their 22 and duly conceded another penalty as @entity99 tried to recover the situation , handing @entity4 a five - point lead heading into the last ten minutes of the half			1
@entity0 's flanker @entity103 ( right ) clatters into @entity4 number eight @entity104 however , one thing @entity0 have uncovered in the past year is an ability to finish from the sniff of a chance			2
in the 32nd minute @entity4 were pressing the home 22 and looking dangerous when a big tackle forced a loose ball and @entity36 picked it up and took off on an 80 - metre run that left the @entity4 trailing and hugely deflated , and the full - back celebrating his eighth try in 27 test matches			2
@entity0 should have been further ahead at half - time but @entity117 was caught just short after twice catching chips and @entity99 squandered another golden chance when a clever lineout trick set the scrum - half racing through a gap 15 metres out , but he dropped the pass			1
@entity32 was guilty of the same error , failing to grasp another slick lineout coming onto the ball at full pelt , and so the sides disappeared with just two points between them			0
the giving - up of an early penalty maintained the all - too - familiar pattern in the second half			0
but where it changed was in @entity137 pulling this one wide of the uprights and the @entity9 responding swiftly by taking advantage of two penalty awards to move into @entity4 ’s 22 , and from another lineout platform , @entity32 showed superb strength to hold off two tackles and dive into the right - hand corner			0
@entity0 number eight @entity147 is brought down by @entity4 prop @entity148 mistakes continued to puncture @entity9 promise , however , with @entity147 kicking straight out and @entity151 delaying his pass long enough to squander an overlap , but @entity0 maintained the pressure and @entity99 grasped a penalty chance to extend the lead to a more comfortable ten points 15 minutes in			0
@entity0 ’s lineout and scrum began to dominate the @entity4 with and without the ball , despite – or perhaps because of - the @entity161 replacing their entire front row			0
@entity99 eased @entity0 further ahead with a penalty with 15 minutes remaining , and big - bearded prop @entity40 put it more than two converted tries out of @entity4 ’s reach with terrific strength to batter between two @entity4 front rows and crash over			1
@entity99 ’s conversion took him to 299 points but he was replaced before reaching the 300 - mark by @entity172 and was only able to watch as @entity151 missed adding the extras to a fifth try by @entity175			0
it was @entity151 who created the chance with a skilful high ball into the dead - ball area , which bounced back off replacement @entity180 into @entity183 ’s hands for an easy dot - down to allow @entity0 to seal a rare 11 - try tally over three autumn games that should maintain the growing self - belief in @entity23 ’s squad .			0

tries from flanker @entity67 and centre @entity36 *helped* @entity0 to a 14 - 12 half - time lead
@entity4 fly half @entity45 kicked four penalties for the visitors
@entity23 's men pulled away after the break scoring tries through @entity32 , @entity40 and @entity175
