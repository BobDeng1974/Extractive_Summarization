by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor sir @entity2 said @entity4 's win would inadvertently help @entity5 @entity7 's stunning election victories last week will help @entity5 win concessions from @entity9 , former prime minister @entity2 claimed today			1
sir @entity2 said @entity9 leaders could no longer ignore rising euroscepticism and return powers to @entity14 in the prime minister 's renogotiation			1
he predicted that the prime minister would win restrictions to free movement rules to curb immigration			1
sir @entity2 claimed the success of @entity21 and other @entity23 parties would force other @entity9 leaders to listen to mr @entity5 's demands			1
but he said despite @entity4 popularity his party would soon slump in the polls			1
he said @entity7 was a ' very intolerant ' party and its appeal is not likely to last for a ' long time ' despite its success in the @entity9 elections			1
sir @entity2 said : ' the recent @entity9 elections have emphasised that very clearly			0
i think the results of these negotiations right across @entity9 have made a renegotiation much easier			0
' it ’s apparent now to governments right across @entity9 that reform of the @entity43 is necessary – it is n’t working as it should , it is n’t working in the way in which @entity9 citizens think it should			2
' and i think that gives a great deal of power to the @entity14 determination to renegotiate because they will have allies today which in the 1990s we , frankly , did n’t have			0
' he claimed the @entity14 had won concessions from @entity9 in the past and mr @entity5 would be able to do the same			2
the former @entity57 leader said : ' many people , when i went to @entity59 said it would not be possible to negotiate @entity14 out of the euro , i did			0
' they said it would n’t be possible to negotiate us out of the social chapter , i did			0
' more recently , they said @entity5 could n’t negotiate a budget reduction , he did			2
' now , they ’re just three , there are several other things the prime minister has done which people said could n’t be done			1
so let us not say it ca n’t be done - it can be done and i think this prime minister can do it and i think these recent elections will help him do it			1
' @entity5 , speaking shortly after arriving in @entity80 this week , demanded that the @entity43 stopped being so ' bossy ' sir @entity2 said people would ' surprised ' with how much the prime minister would be able to do			1
he said : ' of course , nobody can be certain what will happen , but as the prime minister has said himself , free movement of people can not be unqualified and i think that is very important			1
' he added : ' free movement of capital , trade and people is one of the fundamentals , but i think that is an issue that will have to be addressed by governments other than us			0
' and i think there are some things that could be done , as the prime minister ’s already said , free movement to take up work , not benefits			1
' i do n’t think you can have an absolute restriction on movements , but maybe you could qualify it in different ways and i think that is something that would find an echo in many @entity9 governments , as well as here			0
' the former pm also insisted that mr @entity5 would bring back enough from other @entity43 leaders to satisfy @entity14 demands and win a referendum			1
he said the public would back @entity14 's place in @entity9 - and eventually lose interest in @entity7			1
sir @entity2 said mr @entity4 has been ' very smart			2
. at exploiting grievances '			0
@entity4 was congratulated by fellow @entity9 meps after winning last week 's elections but he warned that the arguments for quitting @entity9 are ' absolute nonsense ' and said it would cost billions			2
he said : ' @entity21 are extremely good at exploiting grievances and people are very upset about @entity9			0
politically , @entity21 have been very smart in exploiting those disagreements , but @entity21 are not , frankly , a very tolerant party			0
' i do n’t think their appeal is one that is instinctively likely to continue for a long time and i think we have seen that in some of the things they have done recently			0
so i think they are there and of course they are an impediment for the moment			0
' he added that the investment which has helped @entity14 's economic recovery had not just come for our ' pretty blue eyes ' but because of the single market and the @entity43			2
he said : " frankly [ those calling for @entity14 to leave the @entity43 ] are wrong			2
much of this publicity about that is absolute nonsense			0
we would lose free access to the single market ... we ’d have to pay for access to the single market			0

former @entity160 claims @entity43 leaders can no longer ignore euroscepticism
says @entity4 's success is *inadvetant* boost to @entity5 's renogotiation
prime minister will also win restrictions on @entity43 migration he claims
@entity7 as ' very intolerant ' party that will lose its appeal
