tropical forests are growing faster than scientists thought due to rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere			1
a @entity6 - led study has found that tropical forests are absorbing 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year as they photosynthesise and grow			1
and this is far more than is absorbed by the vast areas of boreal forest that encircle the @entity11			0
trees and plants in tropical forests ( stock image ) are absorbing 1.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide a year			1
the researchers claim their findings show that rainforests are essential for soaking up excess greenhouse gases , and play a far greater role than had been previously realised the researchers claim their findings show that rainforests like the @entity23 are essential for soaking up excess greenhouse gases , and play a far greater role than had been previously realised			2
dr @entity25 , a researcher at @entity6 's @entity26 in @entity27 , who led the study , said : ' this is good news , because uptake in boreal forests is already slowing , while tropical forests may continue to take up carbon for many years			2
' deforestation in the world 's biggest rainforest , the @entity23 , dropped by 18 per cent over the past year			0
@entity37 said that 4,848 square kilometers ( 1,870 square miles ) of rain forest were destroyed between august 2013 and july 2014 - an area slightly larger than the @entity41 state of @entity42			0
the figures were down from 5,891 square kilometers ( 2,275 square miles ) cut down during the same period a year earlier			0
it comes in the wake of the adoption of a controversial bill revising the @entity48 , which was 2012 after more than a decade - long effort by @entity37 's powerful agricultural lobby , mostly eased restrictions for landowners with smaller properties , allowing them to clear land closer to riverbanks			0
rain forest clearing is responsible for about 75 percent of @entity37 's emissions , as vegetation is burned and felled trees rot			0
the @entity23 extends over 6.1 million square kilometers ( 3.8 million square miles ) , with more than 60 percent within @entity37 's borders			0
however , dr @entity25 and his colleagues warn that deforestation in tropical rainforests could exacerbate climate change by leaving more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere			2
in total , they estimate that forests and other vegetation absorb around 2.7 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide , about 30 per cent of that emitted by humans			1
as emissions add more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere , forests worldwide are using it to grow faster			2
however , the rate at which they absorb this has been hard to estimate with many studies producing contradictory results			0
as many rainforests consist of mature trees that are often hundreds of years old , they were not thought to absorb much carbon dioxide			0
young fast growing trees tend to absorb more carbon dioxide as they use the carbon as they grow			0
global air flows and data on deforestation also suggested tropical forests were releasing more carbon dioxide than they absorb			1
but this new study suggests the tropical forests are using far more of the carbon , and so growing far faster than previously believed			1
dr @entity25 and his colleagues , whose work is published in the @entity99 , used computer models , satellite images , data from forest plots and photosynthetic experiments to build up a picture of how forests absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere			2
deforestation and burning releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , and were thought to cause tropical forests to release more carbon dioxide than they absorbed			1
but the new study suggests this is not the case @entity6 satellites monitor changes in rainforests like the @entity23 ( pictured from above ) to estimate carbon dioxide uptake			2
in total , experts estimate that forests and other vegetation absorb around 2.7 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide , about 30 per cent of that emitted by humans he said : ' what we 've had up till this paper was a theory of carbon dioxide fertilisation based on phenomena at the microscopic scale and observations at the global scale that appeared to contradict those phenomena			1
' here , at least , is a hypothesis that provides a consistent explanation that includes both how we know photosynthesis works and what 's happening at the planetary scale			0
' all else being equal , the effect is stronger at higher temperatures , meaning it will be higher in the tropics than in the boreal forests			0
' however , he added that changes in water supply to forests due to changing climate and deforestation could alter the amount of carbon dioxide tropical forests are absorbing			1
he said : ' the future tropical balance of deforestation and climate sources and regrowth and carbon dioxide sinks will only remain a robust feature of the global carbon cycle if the vast tropical forests are protected from destruction			1
' scientists believed that rainforests were poor at absorbing carbon dioxide despite their rich plant life , but the new study shows that they , in fact , account for more than half of all greenhouse gases absorbed by vegetation			1

@entity6 study shows tropical forests absorb 1.5 billion tonnes of @entity178 a year
rainforests absorb more than half of *co2* taken up by vegetation globally
scientists previously believed tropical forests emitted carbon dioxide
researchers claim their findings *emphasise* the need to protect rainforests from deforestation to help *counteract* human greenhouse gas emissions
