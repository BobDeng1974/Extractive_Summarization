' i feel like it 's breaking ground , ' the 29 - year - old told the @entity12			1
' this is a milestone			0
i never could have imagined that i could be here			0
' @entity0 endured years of bulling during her small town upbringing in @entity15 , and the abuse she suffered would continue through to her adult life and career			1
she is seen here with her husband , @entity30 provocative : @entity0 has built her name on social media over the years , and now has an agency ' it took a really long time to get over things that had happened to me during the vital years of my life , ' she said			1
as a teenager , @entity0 traveled to @entity40 for a model casting , but , at 5 feet 5 , was told she was too short and too big			1
' my mom always encouraged me , ' she said			0
' but the rest of my friends and family thought i was nuts			0
' @entity0 puts her determination down to her activeness			1
@entity0 has a nine - year - old son , a husband , she works out with a trainer , and is now getting a steady stream of work			1
' i never sit down			0
if i 'm not shooting twelve hours a day , i 'm out doing errands and going to meetings , ' @entity0 told @entity55			1
sexy : the 29 - year - old is being hailed as the largest plus - sized model in the business unabashed : @entity0 's career has proven wrong the bullies that have followed her through life her big break came in 2011 , when @entity63 chose her to be the face of their documentary series , @entity66 , after discovering her online			1
since then she has modeled for @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , and more			0

they live in @entity88 but her biggest break yet came on thursday , when @entity22 announced they had signed @entity0 to their plus - size arm , @entity92			1
it was a strange move , given @entity0 - at 260 pounds - is the shortest and largest model in their portfolio			1
plus - size models are typically size 8 to 16 and at least 5 feet 8 inches			1
the agency said they cottoned on to @entity0 because of her vast social media influence , especially on @entity101			2

@entity0 's trajectory is a triumph over her critics and her bullies			2
perhaps in a ' that - will - show - them ' move , she has a tattoo of @entity132 on her right arm			0
but success does not nastiness , and @entity0 still receives plenty of negativity			2
' i 'm always still that 13 - year - old girl in @entity1 who people told i was n't good enough , ' she said			0
' i never could have imagined that i could be here			0
