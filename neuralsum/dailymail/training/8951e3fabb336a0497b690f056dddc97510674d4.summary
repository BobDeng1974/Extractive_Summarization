ministers are being urged to take ‘ urgent action ’ after cancer patients in @entity3 were given access to another drug not available in @entity6 and @entity7			1
@entity8 , aimed at kidney cancer patients who have stopped responding to other treatments , is to be given the green light north of the border after it was shown to significantly extend life			1
the drug – which costs £ 3,000 a month – could potentially help 6,000 sufferers a year , but has so far been deemed not cost effective by the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) for use on the @entity19 in @entity6 and @entity7			1
the body is currently considering an appeal against its decision			0
price of life : at a cost of £ 3,000 a month @entity24 is expensive but it has been shown to prolong life in cancer sufferers who have stopped responding to other treatments experts have expressed dismay at the latest example of ‘ health apartheid ’ between patients north and south of the border			1
the decision of the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) to give the go - ahead for the drug in @entity3 means taxpayers in @entity6 and @entity7 will have to contribute to the funding of the drug north of the border , but not benefit from it			1
critics of @entity17 say it is judging drugs using criteria from the last century and said the case for a fundamental overhaul was now overwhelming			0
this year alone , the body has given only one positive recommendation for a new cancer medicine for @entity19 use , from the 12 ‘ single technology ’ appraisals on which it has made final or preliminary decisions			2
at the @entity60 ’s annual conference last month , @entity58 was forced to announce a two year extension to the £ 200million a year @entity62 – an emergency fund which funds treatments denied by @entity17			1
but there are growing calls for more sweeping reforms			0
professor @entity68 , a consultant oncologist at @entity69 in @entity70 , said : ‘ whilst the @entity37 decision is good news for patients in @entity3 , it ’s important that all patients across the @entity76 have routine access to innovative treatments			2
there is a clear need for kidney cancer treatments and it ’s therefore very important that patients can have access to treatment options at all stages of the disease			1
’ @entity87 , the @entity76 managing director of @entity88 , which manufactures @entity8 , said : ‘ government needs to play its part in fixing age - old problems to ensure that innovative new medicines are used by the @entity19 and get to the patients that need them			2
‘ by continuing to focus on medicines as a cost not an investment , @entity89 will not solve these issues			2
instead it sends a clear message that innovation is not valued in the @entity76 and it is not prepared to invest in life - saving and life - changing discoveries			2
outdated : critics of @entity17 say it is judging drugs using criteria from the last century and said the case for a fundamental overhaul was now overwhelming ‘ decisions like today ’s , where a vital cancer medicine is denied to patients in @entity112 and @entity7 by @entity17 , but at the same time approved for @entity3 patients , further highlights the fundamental problems			1
we can not allow this to become the norm			0
‘ the prime minister must take urgent action			0
a new pro-innovation mandate for @entity17 is needed to get patients the new medicines they need and prove that the @entity76 is open for business			2
’ @entity124 , the firm ’s oncology business unit head , added : ‘ whilst we welcome this decision for patients in @entity3 , yet again we find ourselves in a situation where two health bodies , which have assessed similar information , reach an entirely different conclusion on the value of a medicine			2
’ axitinib , which is marketed under the tradename @entity8 , is designed to treat adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of prior treatment with other drugs - sunitinib or a cytokine			1
one trial suggested it extended life by two months on average , with some patients surviving significantly longer			1
patients in @entity6 will have to appeal to the @entity62 , though funding is not guaranteed			2
patients in @entity7 have no access to any second line advanced treatment for kidney cancer and have to prove ‘ exceptional circumstances ’ in order to even be considered			1
@entity6 has warned that more people are being diagnosed with and dying from kidney cancer in @entity112 today , compared to ten years ago			1
around 30 per cent currently present with late stage disease			0
kidney cancer is the eighth most common cancer in the @entity76 , with an estimated 3,850 people dying from the disease each year			1
@entity160 , chief executive of @entity17 , said : ‘ axitinib is currently being looked at for @entity17 by an independent appraisal committee			0
earlier this year a draft decision to say no to @entity8 was appealed and the drug is being considered again			0
‘ decisions on which drugs to approve are often finely balanced			0
health services have to be confident that the extra benefit to patients justifies the price			0
if we are not sure , we have to say so , in the interests of all those of us who expect the @entity19 to apply its resources equitably across all of the demands we make of it			0
‘ @entity17 is , quite properly , scrutinised closely on its decisions and the methods we use to arrive at them			0
' we regularly review our methods to ensure they are consistent with the ambitions set for the @entity19 and we are currently considering ways to make sure that we take full account of the impact of the severity of different diseases and conditions , together with the wider benefits to society of new treatments			0
' we have always relied on feedback to draft the very best processes and guidance			0
we have asked patients ’ groups , industry and our other stakeholders to help us develop this new value assessment approach			0
drugs , especially those for cancer , which extend life for terminally ill people , have been given special weight by @entity17 since january 2009			1

axitinib , aimed at kidney cancer patients is to be given the green light north of the border after it was shown to significantly extend life
but the £ 3,000 month drug has been deemed not cost effective for patients in @entity112 and @entity7
