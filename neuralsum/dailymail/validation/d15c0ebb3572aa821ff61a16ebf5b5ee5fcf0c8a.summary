a plan to keep @entity1 as @entity3 leader even if he loses the election to @entity5 , is being drawn up by senior allies			1
cabinet colleagues , including @entity8 and @entity9 , will attempt to form a protective ring around mr @entity1 if he falls short in may – provided mr @entity5 does not secure a decisive victory			1
they believe that continuity at the top will be essential if there is a prospect of a second general election			2
senior @entity17 have hatched a plan to keep @entity1 as @entity3 leader even if he loses the election to @entity5 @entity3 high command is even preparing to declare a ‘ moral victory ’ if – as some polls suggest - mr @entity1 secures more votes than @entity23 but emerges with fewer seats			1
mr @entity1 will come under intense pressure to step down if he loses to mr @entity5 , who many @entity17 rate as the worst @entity2 since @entity28			1
the last leader of a major party to cling on after defeat was @entity32 in 1987			0
one @entity3 mp said mr @entity1 ‘ wo n’t last five minutes ’ unless he manages to retain the keys to @entity35 in may			2
‘ he either wins , or he goes , ’ the mp said			0
‘ he has said himself that if he ca n’t beat @entity5 he does n’t deserve to be in this game , and he ’s right			0
’ but some senior ministers believe mr @entity1 should stay on if mr @entity5 is only able to cobble together a fragile coalition			2
in this scenario , they fear the party could be plunged into a destabilising leadership battle in the run - up to a second election that could take place as early as the autumn			0
chancellor @entity8 ( left ) will attempt to form a protective ring around mr @entity1 if he falls short in may – provided @entity5 ( right ) does not secure a decisive victor mr @entity8 is reported to have held talks with @entity3 whips last week to draw up a ‘ @entity52 ’ strategy for protecting mr @entity1 from an internal challenge , although a source close to the chancellor insisted the @entity3 were still ‘ playing to win ’			1
current polls suggest that neither @entity23 nor the @entity3 will secure an outright majority in may – raising the prospect of either another coalition or a period of minority government			0
senior @entity17 are urging mr @entity1 to govern alone if the @entity3 emerge as the largest party but do not have an overall majority			1
they argue that ditching the @entity62 would allow the party to govern properly , and free up 23 ministerial jobs to aid party management			0
one @entity1 ally said : ‘ if there is an opportunity to govern without going into coalition , we would seize it			0
