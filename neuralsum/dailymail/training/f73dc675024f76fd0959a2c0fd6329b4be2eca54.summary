when someone emerges unscathed after their 8,000bhp race car becomes a fireball at 260mph , you might expect them to be relieved			2
but for drag racer @entity6 - who has now survived three such explosions in as many years - his dramatic exit from a qualifying race was simply cause for a sulk			1
spectators at the @entity12 , in @entity13 , @entity14 , were stunned when the uninjured driver climbed from the smoking wreckage , tossed a scrap of bodywork to the tarmac and stomped off to the pits			1
everything but the bonnet was ripped off and strewn across the track as a parachute deployed to bring the charred framework to a halt			0
according to @entity43 , the explosion took place after an intake valve dropped into one of the engine cylinders , leaving three of the four race lanes scattered with debris			0
violent : the top and sides of the shell are blown clean off as flames tear through the entire car @entity56 : the emergency parachute slows the smoking wreck from 260mph while @entity6 faced his third consecutive frustration in the qualifying rounds , rival @entity59 claimed his fourth @entity63 victory in a row on sunday			1
his victory at @entity67 , in @entity68 , @entity14 , marked four wins in five races as he lifted the trophy at the @entity73 event , @entity65 reports			0
other winners in the @entity76 series included @entity77 in the @entity79 class and @entity80 in @entity81			0
unbelievable : @entity6 walks away from what 's left of his 8,000bhp car , seeming more concerned about dropping out of the tournament than his incredible escape			2
