@entity0 claims we 'll find aliens in the next 10 to 20 years – and now the agency is revving up its efforts to track them down			1
the group has put together a team of ' extraterrestrial experts ' to see if any of the planets discovered outside our solar system are habitable			2
and it says that amateur astronomers could help with its ' unprecedented ' search for @entity15 by accessing research data online			1
the study of exoplanets is a relatively new field , and began with the discovery of the first exoplanet around a star like our sun in 1995			0
since the launch of the @entity50 space telescope six years ago , more than 1,000 exoplanets have been found , with thousands of additional candidates waiting to be confirmed			2
@entity0 has set up a website for the public called @entity54 which allows anyone to search the data gathered by @entity50 , which launched six years ago			1
scientists are also developing new ways to confirm the habitability of these worlds and search for biosignatures , or signs of life			1
during a talk last month , @entity0 said humanity will encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade			1
' i believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond @entity21 in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years , ' said @entity72 , chief scientist for @entity0 , ( pictured ) at a @entity74 panel discussion by applying a ' system science ' approach , the team hopes to understand an alien planet 's biology interacts with the atmosphere , geology , oceans , and interior of a planet			1
the announcement comes just weeks after @entity0 's top scientist predicted we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them			1
during a talk in @entity74 last month , the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade			0
alien hunters from the @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity36 are tasked with answering the question : ' what are the properties of exoplanetary systems , as they relate to their formation , evolution , and potential to harbour life ? ' they will combine astronomical observations of exoplanets and forming planetary systems with powerful computer simulations and cutting - edge microscopic studies of meteorites			1
the team from @entity113 in @entity114 will take a similar approach			2
this research group will place planetary habitability in a chemical context , with the goal of producing a ' periodic table of planets			0
' researchers from @entity123 , @entity124 , will be exploring the sources and sinks for volatiles on habitable worlds			0
this research will help determine the past and present habitability of @entity131 and even @entity132			0
the team centered at @entity0 's @entity134 will investigate habitability on a more local scale			1
it will examine the habitability of solar system rocky planets through time			0
the team from @entity38 in @entity142 , @entity143 , will design new spectrometers - optical instruments that measure the spectrum of light - with the stability to reach @entity21 - detecting precision for nearby stars			1
a group led the @entity153 will explore the existence and evolution of exospheres around exoplanets , the outer , ' unbound ' portion of a planet 's atmosphere			0
from the @entity37 , @entity162 , a group will investigate how novel maths equations can be used to extract information from light that is emitted and reflected by planetary atmospheres			0
' i believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond @entity21 in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years , ' @entity72 , chief scientist for @entity0 , said			1
' we know where to look , we know how to look , and in most cases we have the technology			0
' @entity174 , interim director of heliophysics at the agency , added : ' it 's definitely not an if , it 's a when			0
' ' we are not talking about little green men , ' @entity72 said			0
' we are talking about little microbes			0
' the announcement was prompted by the recent discovery of water by @entity0 in surprising places			2
@entity184 , director of planetary science at @entity0 , noted that a recent study of the @entity131 atmosphere found 50 per cent of the planet 's northern hemisphere once had oceans a mile deep			2
scientists using the @entity192 recently provided powerful evidence that @entity195 's @entity194 ( pictured ) has a saltwater , sub-surface ocean , likely sandwiched between two layers of ice the same study found that water had been present on the red planet for up to 1.2 billion year			2
' we think that long period of time is necessary for life to get more complex , ' @entity72 said			2
@entity0 associate administrator @entity207 said he is excited about seeing what form life beyond @entity21 may take			1
in their hunt for alien life , astronomers have so far focused on looking for @entity21 - like planets around smaller , cooler suns			1
but these exoplanets - despite having a chance of holding water - are believed to be locked in a rotation around their sun which causes only one side of their surface face the star			0
now astronomers claim that such exoplanets actually rotate around their stars , and spin at such a speed that they exhibit a day - night cycle similar to @entity21 – increasing the chance of finding alien life			1
planets with potential oceans could have a climate that is much more similar to @entity21 's than previously expected , ' said @entity233 , a postdoctoral fellow at the @entity234 ( @entity235 ) at the @entity236			1
' if we are correct , there is no permanent , cold night side on exoplanets causing water to remain trapped in a gigantic ice sheet , ' he said			0
' whether this new understanding of exoplanets ' climate increases the ability of these planets to develop life remains an open question			2
' ' once we get beyond @entity131 , which formed from the same stuff as @entity21 , the likelihood that life is similar to what we find on this planet is very low , ' he said			1
' i think we 're one generation away in our solar system , whether it 's on an icy moon or on @entity131 , and one generation [ away ] on a planet around a nearby star			0
at the same conference last year , @entity0 administrator @entity266 made a more conservative estimate			2
he claimed that we will find life within the next 20 years - with a high chance it will be outside our solar system			1
@entity0 next @entity131 rover , scheduled to launch in 2020 , will search for signs of past life and bring samples for a possible return to @entity21 for analysis			1
@entity0 also hopes to land astronauts on @entity131 in the 2030s , which @entity72 says is crucial key to the search for @entity131 life			1
' i 'm a field geologist ; i go out and break open rocks and look for fossils , ' @entity72 said			0
' those are hard to find			2
' so i have a bias that it 's eventually going to take humans on the surface of @entity131 — field geologists , astrobiologists , chemists — actually out there looking for that good evidence of life that we can bring back to @entity21 for all the scientists to argue about			1
' the space agency is also planning a mission to @entity299 , which may launch as early as 2022			0
it hopes to find out whether the icy moon is habitable			0
meanwhile , the agency 's @entity302 ( @entity302 ) , will launch in 2018 to scope out the atmospheres of nearby ' super-earth ' alien planets			0
@entity308 took this image of the @entity299 rising above @entity195 's cloud tops			0
the space agency is planning a mission to @entity299 , which may launch as early as 2022 , to find out whether the moon is habitable			0

alien search team , dubbed @entity19 , includes scientists from 10 universities
@entity319 could help with ' unprecedented ' search by accessing data online
comes weeks after @entity0 said we will find aliens in the next 10 to 20 years
but the likelihood that life is similar to that on @entity21 is low , @entity0 claims
