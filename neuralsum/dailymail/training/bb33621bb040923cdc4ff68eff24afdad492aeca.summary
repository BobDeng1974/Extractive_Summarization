by @entity1 reporter published : 20:21 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 21:18 est , 26 july 2012 on a warm summer afternoon , @entity2 , a 25 - year - old @entity3 war veteran , called out to his father from a leafy spot in their backyard			1
then , as the two stood steps apart , @entity2 saluted , raised a gun to his head and pulled the trigger			1
' his eyes rolled back , ' his father , @entity14 , said softly as he recounted the 2009 suicide			1
' there was just nothing i could do			2
' weeks before he killed himself at the family 's home in @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity2 received a letter from the @entity25 accusing him of ' over-reporting ' the extent of his psychiatric problems			1
proud : army veteran @entity2 is pictured with his parents @entity14 and @entity29 at his graduation from boot camp			1
he committed suicide in april 2009 in the family 's backyard it was the culmination of a long struggle that @entity2 , diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury related to his service , had waged since returning home from the war to try to hold down a steady job , obtain @entity25 disability benefits and resume a life as close to normal as possible			1
' i 've often thought about finding that doctor and saying , '' over-reporting ? ! '' and giving him the death certificate , ' @entity45 said			2
about once every half hour in @entity52 , a veteran within the @entity25 healthcare system tries to commit suicide , according to @entity25 figures for 2011			1
president @entity55 singled out suicide prevention as a priority when he talked about veterans issues on the campaign trail in 2008			2
he once cited the case of an 89 - year - old @entity62 veteran who took his life the day after complaining about his treatment by the @entity25			2
chilling : @entity45 demonstrates how his son , @entity66 veteran @entity2 , saluted before shooting himself in the head in the woods behind their home in @entity22 , @entity23 tragic loss : @entity14 and @entity72 hold a photo of their son , @entity66 veteran @entity2 who killed himself after a long battle with @entity79 ' it is an outrage			1
it is a betrayal of the ideals that we ask our troops to risk their lives for , ' @entity55 told an audience in @entity88 , @entity89 , on may 12 , 2008			0
he reiterated those sentiments at a @entity92 convention in @entity93 , @entity94 , on monday , saying he had told @entity96 chiefs and va secretary @entity97 : ' we 've got to do better			0
â€¦ this has to be all hands on deck			0
' in the nearly three years since @entity2 's death , the @entity55 administration has expanded efforts to tackle suicide among veterans , some of which were initiated at the end of the @entity111 administration			1
it has hired more suicide prevention staff and enhanced tracking of high - risk patients			2
other benefits meant to help veterans returning from war have been expanded , particularly educational benefits under the 2008 @entity120			0
perhaps the most lauded part of the @entity25 's ramped - up effort to combat suicide has been a hotline that has received more than half a million calls since it was created in 2007 , including more than 20,000 rescues of suicidal veterans			1
more recently it launched an online chat service and text messaging			0
tragedy : @entity2 as a child in camouflage paint and a @entity66 t - shirt			1
as an @entity136 veteran he was overwhelmed by his mental health problems devastating reminder : @entity45 points out a bullet hole in the back of his @entity23 home after his 25 - year - old son shot himself the @entity25 has sought to improve data collection , too , and the numbers appear troubling			1
in 2011 there were 17,754 suicide attempts - about 48 a day - up from 10,888 in 2009			2
that increase , the @entity25 said , may largely reflect an improved tracking system put into place in 2010 and a growing number of patients treated at @entity25 facilities			0
the @entity25 could n't provide data on the number of suicides within the @entity156 after 2009 but the figures through that date show a broadly stable rate since 2003 that is higher than the national average			0
outside the @entity25 healthcare system , which has almost 9 million enrollees , the data becomes murky			0
the @entity25 has estimated that roughly 18 veterans nationwide kill themselves every day , but that number is based on limited data			0
a survey , conducted by @entity168 , contacted all 50 states but obtained data for the 2005 - to - 2010 period from only 32			0
the information accounted for about two - thirds of the @entity52 veteran population			1
troubled : army veteran @entity2 struggled to return to normal life after serving his country in @entity3 in those states , veteran suicides increased from 4,801 to 5,017 over a five - year period in which , the @entity25 believes , the @entity52 veteran population declined slightly			1
while the data is imperfect - the @entity25 estimates the reliability of such figures at 78 per cent to 90 per cent - the department said the numbers appeared broadly consistent with trends it has observed			0
@entity97 said that the problem of veteran suicide appeared to be linked to a broader question about mental health in the @entity52			1
he pointed to data showing suicide is the second - biggest cause of death for people ages 25 to 34 and the fourth - biggest cause for people 35 to 54			2
' we got a problem			0
is mental health an issue in this country ? nobody talks about it , ' @entity97 said			0
a copy of the july 29 , 2009 , @entity25 letter to @entity2 denied him an increase in his disability benefits from the $ 974 he was already receiving , citing ' over-reporting ( of ) both mood disturbance and impaired memory difficulty '			1
' mr. @entity2 's death is a tragic outcome			2
our deepest sympathy goes out to his family and loved ones , ' the @entity25 said in response			0
' experience has shown that access to quality mental health services from @entity25 can make a positive difference in the lives of veterans and their families			0
' grief : @entity72 looks at a photo of her son @entity2 who has suffered a traumatic brain injury following his tour of duty @entity45 wonders daily whether his son 's suicide could have been prevented had he received better treatment or found a job he could keep in his condition			1
frustrated with the system , his son had declined treatment from the @entity25 and had turned to a local doctor			0
he also wonders whether @entity2 might have done better if he had reenlisted			2
going to war was risky			0
but , in @entity2 's case , so was coming home			1
' it 's just as dangerous , as it turns out , out here - because of the lack of jobs , lack of everything , ' he said .			0

@entity2 called out to his father at their home in @entity22 , @entity23
once every half hour in @entity52 , a veteran tries to commit suicide
