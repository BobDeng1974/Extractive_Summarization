however , in publicly pointing the finger at @entity34 , who denied abducting @entity26 , mr @entity13 apparently neglected to mention the disappearance of his own camper van within months of @entity26 ’s disappearance , or the fact he had been in @entity29			1
those details , disclosed in documents held by the @entity48 , show he sought emergency funds from the organisation after claiming his van and all his possessions had been stolen			0
the documents also reveal he travelled through @entity29			0

’ earlier this month , @entity2 detectives approached the @entity11 seeking to establish the whereabouts of 50 - year - old mr @entity13 ’s military records			1
