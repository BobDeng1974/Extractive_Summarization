with 17 games gone , @entity0 and @entity1 have broken away from the chasing pack			1
@entity5 ’s expert columnist assesses both teams ’ chances in the title race			2
goalkeeper @entity0 - 9.5 , @entity1 - 9 i ’m a really big @entity11 fan , but it has been an inspired decision by @entity13 to bring @entity14 back from his loan at @entity16 and make him @entity0 ’s no 1			1
@entity11 had a tough spell last year , every goalkeeper has to suffer that , and he ’s come back stronger , commands the area and has made key saves			0
but if @entity14 stays at @entity0 he could become the @entity24 ’s best ever goalkeeper			2
he is exceptional — if you could choose one goalkeeper in the league to have in your team it would be him			0
@entity1 face a tough battle with @entity0 to retain their @entity24 crown @entity14 has been excellent in goal since coming back from @entity16 and replacing @entity32 @entity11 has been a leader for @entity1 at the back after overcoming a tough spell last season defence @entity0 - 9 , @entity1 - 9 when both teams have their back four fit , i ca n’t separate them			1
you can name @entity0 ’s four in defence pretty much every week , which has helped @entity13			1
@entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 are a tight unit , extremely strong , and they have @entity47 to bring in at left back if they need a more attacking approach			0
@entity1 hardly ever name the same back four , switching @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			2
but they are all top - quality defenders who combine well in a back four			0
@entity42 ( centre ) scored at @entity58 on monday night and he leads a strong @entity0 back line @entity1 have been without their leader and captain @entity51 due to injury problems midfield @entity0 - 9.5 , @entity1 - 9 @entity0 just edge this after bringing in @entity64 and @entity65 this year			1
if you look at match - winners , both @entity0 and @entity1 are full of them			1
@entity68 is a little genius , @entity70 is finding form and @entity72 can turn defence into attack , run the length of the field and score			0
@entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity65 are brilliant technicians			0
@entity82 has switched sides and will have a vital role for @entity1 , but what @entity0 lost in his goals they ’ve made up for with @entity65 ’s assists ; it ’s unbelievable he has 12 already			1
it is defensive midfield where @entity0 are slightly stronger			2
@entity91 has two similar players in @entity93 and @entity94 who can play that role , but neither are close to @entity64 , who has been phenomenal			0
despite not always being at his best , @entity72 provides @entity1 with strength and power in midfield @entity65 has been a creative genius for @entity0 since his move from @entity102 in the summer @entity64 has forged a reputation as one of the best defensive midfielders in the @entity24 @entity82 moved from @entity0 to @entity1 and scored against his former club in september attack @entity0 - 9 , @entity1 - 9.5 @entity1 are ahead in this department , based purely on @entity109			1
@entity0 ’s @entity110 is a brilliant striker and just what @entity13 needed , but @entity109 was unstoppable before his injury			2
they need him fit and firing if they want to win the league			0
@entity115 and @entity116 for @entity1 , and @entity117 , who is not the player he once was , and @entity119 at @entity0 are strong alternative options			2
but it will be a case of who can stay fittest the longest out of @entity109 and @entity110			0
@entity109 's goals this season have kept @entity1 in touch with @entity0 , but he is currently injured @entity110 hit the ground running at @entity127 after his move from @entity16 @entity127 - january 31 @entity129 - march 1 @entity130 - april 11 @entity131 - may 2 @entity131 - january 1 @entity132 - april 25 my title verdict ... @entity0 - 37/40 , @entity1 - 36.5/40 there is barely anything to pick between the two teams , but what will be a decisive factor is that @entity0 have already got results in difficult away fixtures , whereas @entity1 still have many to play			1
it gives @entity0 that little advantage which could make the difference			0
there is no love lost between @entity13 and @entity91 — these two will never be friends			0
@entity91 has no respect for @entity13 and it ’s the same the other way			0
the league is a two - horse race and right now the @entity0 manager is inching ahead of his rival			1
@entity0 boss @entity13 and @entity1 manager @entity91 do not see eye - to - eye @entity13 won back to back titles with @entity0 in 2005 and 2006 in his first spell with the club			1

@entity0 and @entity1 in a two - horse race for the title
@entity13 's side are three points clear heading into @entity165
there is barely anything to separate the two title rivals
city have tougher away days left *compared* to @entity0
