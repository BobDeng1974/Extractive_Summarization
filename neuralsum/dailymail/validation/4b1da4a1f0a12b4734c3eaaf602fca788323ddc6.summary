@entity0 left @entity1 applauding in the @entity2 stands , the football world entertained and @entity4 on the turf on wednesday night as he pulled off a stunning nutmeg on the unfortunate @entity8 midfielder			1
the @entity10 superstar made a habit of performing the skill during his side 's 1 - 0 @entity14 win , mesmerising both the 92,000 crowd and @entity8 players including @entity19 @entity18			1
after @entity0 's breathtaking display , @entity20 traces the origins of nutmegging and counts down 10 of the best of all time			1
where does the word come from ? the origins of the word have long been debated , with the most popular theory being that nutmegs are slang for a rather private area of the male anatomy â€” a notion put forward by countdown star @entity58 , of @entity59 , who on wednesday night tweeted : ' nutmegging in football comes from the centuries - old slang ' nutmegs ' , meaning ' testicles '			1
in case @entity0 is ever interested			2
' however , the use of the word nutmeg to mean leg in @entity69 rhyming slang has also been put forward as an explanation , while another claim is that it comes from the practice used in nutmeg exports between @entity74 and @entity36 in the 18th century , when nutmegs were such a valuable commodity that unscrupulous exporters used to mix wooden replicas into the sacks being shipped across the @entity81			2
@entity83 's @entity82 puts the ball through the legs of @entity87 's @entity86 this season @entity74 - cano , tunel , ordenar , cocina other @entity90 / @entity89 and @entity92 countries - panna @entity93 - tunnel , @entity94 @entity95 - petit pont @entity97 - langet @entity99 - 25 kopiyok - meaning 25 cents player owes @entity101 - @entity100 @entity102 - poorten , panna @entity105 - o - c - meaning ' oh see ' @entity106 - kobry @entity107 and @entity109 - ole @entity110 - ' chobo , chobwe @entity112 - @entity111 @entity113 - lauyee @entity114 - caneta , saia , rolinho @entity115 - zalozyc @entity116 - koteny @entity117 - kalulu @entity118 - tunnel @entity119 - kolong @entity120 - lochie @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity124 - tunnel @entity125 - pomo @entity126 - cueca , rata @entity128 - deya @entity129 - adma being nutmegged soon came to imply stupidity on the part of the duped victim and cleverness on the part of the trickster			1
it later caught on in football , implying that the player whose legs the ball had been played through had been tricked , or , nutmegged			0
the verb nutmegged is listed by the @entity142 as ' arising in the 1870s which in @entity145 slang came to mean " to be tricked or deceived , especially in a manner which makes the victim look foolish "			2
' in @entity148 a nutmeg is known as ' cano ' or ' tunel ' , while many countries around the world have their own unique words to describe the skill			1
@entity20 's top 10 nutmegs 10			1
@entity154 on @entity155 , @entity157 vs @entity156 , 2003 that is n't written the wrong way			0

@entity0 on @entity4 , @entity10 vs @entity8 , 2015 @entity0 's brilliant piece of skill - one of many on wednesday night - is only good enough for eighth place on our countdown			1
the fact @entity4 came rushing in counts against the @entity187 , although leaving the @entity36 international on his backside earns him extra points			1
@entity28 on @entity191 , @entity192 vs @entity191 , 2010 some @entity19 magic from @entity28 now , as he toys with a helpless @entity191 player in @entity196 the former @entity10 man is renowned for his dribbling skills and they can be seen in full flow in the clip below , which includes an audacious backheel nutmeg			1
@entity203 on @entity204 , @entity87 vs @entity157 , 1992 the first nutmeg on our countdown which ended with the architect scoring			0
@entity203 pounces on a mistake by @entity210 , pops the ball through @entity204 's legs before rounding goalkeeper @entity213 to score			0
not bad for an 18 - year - old			0
@entity215 on @entity216 , @entity217 vs @entity218 , 2011 similar to @entity203 ' effort in that it ended with a goal , @entity215 showed superb vision to knock the ball past @entity216 and create some space for himself			2
his next touch was n't bad either , bending his shot into the bottom corner of @entity228 's net to help @entity218 into the @entity230 fifth round			0
@entity0 on @entity231 , @entity232 vs @entity10 , 2012 wednesday night 's game against @entity8 was n't the first time @entity0 has caught the eye with a nutmeg			1
the little @entity187 showed speed , composure and skill against @entity232 as he put the ball through @entity231 's legs before delightfully chipping the ball into the back of the net			1
@entity245 on @entity246 , @entity247 vs @entity248 , 2014 one of @entity247 's bright young things , @entity245 showed exactly why he 's destined for a big future with this outrageous touch late last year			0
the 20 - year - old 's flicked nutmeg left @entity246 stranded and @entity247 on the attack			0
@entity27 vs @entity255 , @entity256 vs @entity126 , 2013 a wonderful piece of skill from @entity27 who first fools @entity255 with a @entity261 turn before popping the ball in between the @entity265 man 's legs			2
the @entity162 also gets a whack but the referee plays advantage as he retains possession with a neat backheel to a team - mate			0
@entity272 on @entity273 , @entity274 vs @entity275 , 2000 one of the most talented players of his generation , @entity272 was no stranger to moments of magic on the pitch			0
even in a heated @entity282 quarter - final he was cool enough to beat @entity273 with a brilliant rolled nutmeg			2
@entity284 touted as the new @entity286 , @entity19 youngster @entity285 definitely has the skills to rival his compatriot			0
the @entity289 forward pulled off this stunning elastico nutmeg against @entity292 under 20s last month , bamboozling his opponent with his quick feet			0
