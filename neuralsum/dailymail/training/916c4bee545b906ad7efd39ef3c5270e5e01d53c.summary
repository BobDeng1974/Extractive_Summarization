by @entity0 published : 18:12 est , 12 march 2012 updated : 04:39 est , 13 march 2012 water companies unveiled an 11 - point diktat last night to stop 20million people from beating a hosepipe ban			1
as the drought - hit @entity6 and @entity7 of the country faced drastic restrictions on consumption , bosses issued an extensive checklist to prevent households from exploiting loopholes			1
it includes a ban on using a hose or sprinkler to water plants , wash a car or boat , fill fountains , swimming or paddling pools , or to clean patios , driveways or windows			1
even spraying your children to keep them cool in the sunshine will be outlawed , and those caught breaking the rules face a £ 1,000 fine			1
seven water companies announced that they would enforce @entity33 – affecting one in three @entity35 homes – from april 5 after the plans were revealed in the @entity37 yesterday			0
the strict rules are an attempt to close any loopholes after the last hosepipe ban in 2006 led to widespread accusations of cheating , with thousands reported to water companies by their neighbours or served with ' yellow card ' letters warning them to obey the law			1
yesterday water companies stressed that they hoped the ban would be enforced through goodwill and educating people about the need to save water			1
no need for a bridge : the @entity58 has also totally disappeared at @entity59 , @entity60 water , water everywhere : three years ago the @entity58 at @entity63 was a picturesque waterway the restrictions were brought in following two years of chronically low rainfall which has left rivers dry and reservoirs down to record low levels			1
customers of @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 – which cover parts of @entity77 and the @entity78 – and @entity79 and @entity80 will be affected			0
water companies said that without persistent above - average rainfall for several weeks , the unpopular measures could last until the end of the summer in the 14 counties which are already officially in drought			1
otherwise they face ' severe drought ' by the summer , the @entity87 warned yesterday , which could result in extending restrictions to businesses			2
hosepipe bans may also be enforced in @entity95 and @entity96 which are at ' high risk ' of drought conditions this summer , the agency 's @entity92 report said			0
its chairman @entity99 urged businesses to cut down on use , as electricity companies which use water for cooling and water - intensive industries such as concrete manufacturing could be affected			0
predictions of continuing dry weather have raised fears that restrictions could be extended to car washes , road cleaning and public pools			1
dry as a bone : the @entity115 has run dry from @entity116 to its source seven miles upstream at @entity118 scenic : a verdant stretch of the @entity115 before the lack of rain of recent months took its toll the @entity125 's long - range forecast , which is given to @entity126 and businesses , revealed that the chances of heavy rain are as low as 10 per cent between march and may , compared with a long - term average of 20 per cent			1
the average person uses 150 litres of water a day			0
water company infrastructure across @entity134 and @entity135 leaked 3.4billion litres a day in 2010/11 – a third of the @entity35 's usage – according to the regulator @entity138			2
the latest figures revealed that groundwater levels across the affected region are even lower than during the 1976 drought when taps were switched off in some cities , and residents had to use standpipes in the street			0
people enjoying the warm spring weather in @entity150 , @entity77			2
forecasters predict a week of sunshine with temperatures reaching 19 degrees , seven degrees higher than the monthly average golden hello : the rising sun greets a dog walker on @entity158 , while as the day warmed up sun - worshippers flocked to the beach in @entity161 drought conditions are already affecting fruit and cereal crops , as well as destroying wildlife habitats and causing fish to die in low rivers			0
@entity168 of the @entity169 said that if consumers do not start curbing their water use at home , the economy will be affected			0
' if water levels in drought - stricken areas do n't improve , hosepipe bans could be just the beginning and industry will start to be affected , ' he said			2
summer sun : a woman enjoying @entity182 beach yesterday morning riding out : @entity183 enjoys the hot weather and spring daffodils at @entity59 , @entity60 taking the plunge : a couple look set to brave the sea in @entity161 ' the first companies to face bans will be those who waste water unnecessarily and are n't seen as particularly important , like car wash firms			1
' if things continue to get worse , that 's when agriculture will be affected and public parks will struggle with maintaining their gardens			0
' as industries pay per volume of water used , they are not as wasteful of water as homeowners who may leave the tap running or not use watering cans			0
simply put , if people want to stop facing these bans , they need to think more about what they are doing			0
' this is one of the largest hosepipe bans ever implemented			0
the last in the @entity6 was in 2006 affecting 12million people , and 7million in the @entity7 were hit in 2010			1
@entity214 of @entity70 said : ' although it is a hosepipe ban , it is really symbolic of urging people to do everything they can to save water at home			2
' we do n't have sprinkler patrols and helicopters in the air watching people , but we are confident they will do the right thing at a very difficult time because of the exceptionally dry two years we have had			1
' @entity229 , chief executive of @entity230 , said water levels in the underground aquifers were some of the lowest ever recorded			2
he said : ' we know these restrictions will be unpopular , but they will save a lot of water			2
a garden sprinkler uses as much water in an hour as a family of four uses in a day			0
' dry run : the beautiful weather brings out the joggers in @entity244 dawn of summer : the sun rises over @entity246 in @entity247 at the start of what forecasters are predicting will be a warm week			0

water bosses in the @entity6 issue checklist of restrictions for 20m people
it includes washing cars and boats , filling fountains and cleaning windows
those caught breaking the rules face a £ 1,000 fine
it follows two years of low rainfall that 's left reservoirs at record low levels
predictions of more dry weather has led to fears of even more restrictions
