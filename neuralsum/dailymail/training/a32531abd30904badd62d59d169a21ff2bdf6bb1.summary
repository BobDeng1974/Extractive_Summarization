by @entity0 a collection of ancient baby bones has challenged the belief that the @entity4 murdered more baby girls than boys to control the size of their families			1
@entity10 archaeologists have taken another look at the 1,800 - year - old bones discovered near @entity13 , @entity14 and have found that baby girls were not killed more often than male infants			1
of the 12 skeletons discovered at @entity18 , seven were female and none of them shared a mother , leading the scientists to the conclusion that the @entity4 did not use infanticide to manipulate the sex ratio			1
@entity10 archaeologists have taken another look at the 1,800 - year - old bones ( pictured ) discovered near @entity13 , @entity14 and have found that baby girls were not killed more often than male infants it was previously thought that @entity4 used infanticide to manipulate the sex ratio and were more likely to murder girls than boys			1
archaeologists have examined 1,800 - year - old skeletons of babies found in @entity10 to discover that baby girls were not killed more often than male infants			1
infanticide was relatively commonly used to control the size of families			0
the @entity4 did not consider babies fully human and instead thought that children gained humanity over time , with milestones such as their naming and eating food all adding to them being human			0
archaeologists have pointed out that the culture in @entity48 might have been drastically different to that of some of the @entity52 ’s colonies			0
scientists from @entity54 recently analysed ancient dna to study the bones that were unearthed in 1912 and had thought to have been lost			0
there were re-discovered by the director of @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity62 , in an archive and were put under the microscope again , @entity57 reported			0
@entity65 , a skeletal biologist for @entity54 , said : ‘ very often , societies have preferred male offspring , so when they practice infanticide , it tends to be the male babies that are kept and the female babies that are killed			2
’ two years ago he and dr @entity62 said the bones discovered in @entity14 were those of babies that had been killed as they died at the same age just after being born			1
they proposed that that burial site belonged to the babies of prostitutes , but said the idea was a ‘ long shot ’			0
infanticide was used by @entity4 to control their family size , but not - as previously thought - to manipulate the sex ratio			1
@entity89 and @entity90 ( pictured ) the mythical founders of @entity48 , were left in the river @entity92 to die by their parents and were raised by a wolf in the tale now however , they have revised their idea as none of the babies shared a mother and if the babies were born of prostitutes , it would be incredibly unlikely that one of them had not had more than one child , the scientists explained in their paper , which will be published in the @entity108			0
@entity4 texts reveal that infanticide was an accepted way of controlling the size of @entity4 families in a time before contraception			0
while the concept of killing babies to regulate family size seems abhorrent to modern people , the @entity4 did not consider them fully human and instead thought that children gained humanity over time			2
archaeologists have pointed out that the culture in @entity48 might have been drastically different to that of some of the @entity52 ’s colonies			0
the skeletons of 12 babies were discovered at @entity128 near @entity129 in @entity14 just over a century ago			2
they have now given up more of their secrets following dna analysis one document , written by a @entity4 soldier posted in @entity10 suggested that @entity4 were more likely to kill their daughters than sons			1
he told his wife not to bother keeping their baby if it was a girl			0
other than this evidence , there is little know about the use of infanticide by @entity4 in @entity10			2
however , while scientists can not use the shape of bones to determine a baby ’s sex , dna analysis was used on 12 of the bones to reveal that seven of the 12 skeletons were female			1
the 12 babies studied add to dna evidence collected from 13 more baby skeletons , which shows that there is no evidence that baby girls were killed more often than boys			1
‘ it seems as though they were n't using infanticide to manipulate the sex ratio , ’ dr @entity65 said			1
commenting on the study , @entity167 , a bioarchaeologist at the @entity168 , said : ‘ now that we can use dna to tell whether the babies were male or female , we 're starting to revise the commonly held assumptions about infanticide in the @entity4 world			2
’ the @entity4 did not consider babies fully human and instead thought that children gained humanity over time , with milestones such as their naming and eating food all adding to them being human			0
the children pictured in this frieze of an imperial procession , taken from @entity187 in @entity48 , would have been treasured			0

@entity10 archaeologists conducted dna analysis on the 1,800 - year - old bones discovered near @entity13 , @entity14
of the 12 skeletons discovered , just seven were female and *experts* do not think baby girls were killed more often than male infants
@entity4 used infanticide to control the size of their family and it was previously thought that the practice was conducted to manipulate sex ratio
