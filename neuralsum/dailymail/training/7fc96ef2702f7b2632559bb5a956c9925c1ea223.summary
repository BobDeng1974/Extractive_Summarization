a couple who spent £ 20,000 on fertility treatment finally conceived thanks to a controversial treatment involving egg yolk and soya			1
@entity6 and her partner @entity7 spent six years trying for a baby			1
four rounds of @entity11 treatment failed , leaving the couple , from @entity13 , heartbroken			1
but they finally achieved success after trying a new technique being pioneered in @entity17			0
@entity6 and her partner @entity7 spent six years trying for a baby			1
after four unsuccessful rounds of @entity11 and £ 20,000 they eventually succeeded thanks to a pioneering treatment involving egg yolk and soya called intravenous intralipid therapy , it is made from soya bean oil , egg yolk , glycerin and water and administered through an iv drip			1
it works on the premise that some women are actually immune to pregnancy			2
so , when an embryo tries to develop in their womb , their immune system goes into overdrive to destroy it as if it were an intruding bug or virus			0
instead , the iv mixture helps by fighting killer cells that destroy a mother 's chance of pregnancy			1
and thanks to the unusual treatment , ms @entity6 and mr @entity7 are now proud parents to baby @entity50 who was born on july 8 , weighing 7lbs 14oz			1
their son 's arrival means they can now begin saving for their wedding			0
' it was worth every penny because we got @entity50 in the end , ' said ms @entity6 , 43 , a recruitment administrator			1
' we did have to put off our wedding because we could n't afford it after spending so much money on fertility treatment			0
' but @entity50 is perfect			2
he 'll be the guest of honour at our wedding			0
' the intralipid treatment , as it is known , enabled ms @entity6 to conceive baby @entity50 , born in july this year ms @entity6 had expected to have problems conceiving after previously being told she had blocked fallopian tubes			1
but with no success after two years of trying , she and mr @entity7 , a retail manager , received two courses of @entity11 on the @entity72 , both of which failed			1
further heartbreak followed after ms @entity6 conceived after the third cycle - but went on to miscarry at five weeks			1
desperate to become parents , the couple visited a fertility clinic in january last year			0
called intravenous intralipid therapy , it is made from soya bean oil , egg yolk , glycerin and water and administered through an iv drip			1
it works on the premise that some women are actually immune to pregnancy			2
so , when an embryo tries to develop in their womb , their immune system goes into overdrive to destroy it as if it were an intruding bug or virus			0
instead , the iv mixture helps by fighting natural killer cells that destroy a mother 's chance of pregnancy			1
the iv mixture is highly calorific — about 200 calories a dose , the equivalent of a @entity107 bar — and has been likened to ' getting an armful of mayonnaise ' administered via a drip usually twice before conception , and then three more times after , the treatment is thought to help the embryo implant and grow normally			2
alongside this , women are also recommended to take steroids , which further suppress the immune system , and blood thinners to prevent blood clots , which also can impede embryos implanting			2
there , medical experts discovered ms @entity6 had natural killer cells , which were attacking any embryos placed inside her			1
' the cells were rejecting the embryos every time we tried @entity11 , ' she said			1
' it was heartbreaking for us when we could n't get pregnant			0
. we really wanted a baby and that 's why we went through extremes of having @entity11			2
' finally in november last year , they started the process again at the @entity136 fertility centre			0
but this time , doctors decided to combat the natural killer cells by giving ms @entity6 two intralipid infusions of egg yolk and soya oil			1
the therapy stimulates the immune system to suppress so - called ' natural killer cells ' and allow an embryo to implant in the womb			1
one was administered when the fertilised embryos were put back inside her , another when she had a positive pregnancy test			2
she said : ' this was the last time we were going to have ivf and i just had a very positive feeling about it from the beginning			0
' we kept our fingers crossed and two weeks later we had a positive test			0
' when we went for the early scan to check everything was ok , we were petrified - but also over the moon			0
' we saw the picture and @entity7 asked what the flashing was on the screen , and we were told it was the heart beat			2
' we both just burst into tears			0
we had n't even got that far with the other pregnancy			0
' while i was pregnant with @entity50 i never moaned about anything			0
and it was amazing when i felt him kicking inside me			0
having a baby was our priority			0
we 've now started saving for our wedding			0

@entity6 and her partner @entity7 spent six years trying for a baby
had four unsuccessful rounds of @entity11 , *including* one *miscarriage*
doctors eventually discovered ms @entity6 's body was ' immune ' to pregnancy
this meant ' killer cells ' were attacking any embryos placed inside her
@entity192 mixture containing egg yolk and soy could keep these cells at *bay*
so - called intralipid treatment enabled ms @entity6 to conceive baby @entity50
