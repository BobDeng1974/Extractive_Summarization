president @entity0 vowed tuesday to use the power of executive actions to bypass the unfriendly @entity4 - controlled @entity3 in order to advance his liberal economic agenda			1
@entity0 focused on improving the up - and - down economic recovery as he convened his first @entity9 meeting of 2014 and made clear he 'll be doing so with or without the help of the embattled @entity11			1
' we 're not just going to be waiting for legislation in order to make sure that we 're providing @entity15 the kind of help they need , ' the president said			1
with two weeks left before delivering an economy - focused @entity32 address to @entity11 , @entity0 is picking up the pace of his jobs message and demonstrating how he can advance his economic agenda administratively and through his ability to coax action from important interest groups			1
on wednesday he will go to @entity39 to draw attention to the type of manufacturing innovation hub that he promoted in his 2013 @entity32 speech			0
on thursday he has invited college presidents to discuss ways to improve workers ' skills			0
later this month , he is convening ceos at the @entity3 to lay out plans for hiring the long - term unemployed			0
‘ overall , the message to my @entity9 , and that will be amplified in our @entity32 , is that we need all hands on deck to build on the recovery that we 're already seeing , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ the economy is improving , but it can be improving even faster			0
’ ' i 've got a pen , and i 've got a phone ' : in his first @entity9 meeting of 2014 , @entity0 vowed to use the power of the pen to bypass the unfriendly and embattled @entity11 on economic issues at center , @entity64 @entity63 looks on as @entity0 addresses members of the press on tuesday the approach has strong echoes of @entity0 's 2012 ‘ we ca n't wait ’ campaign that sought to depict @entity0 as an impatient executive in the face of inaction from @entity11 , particularly in the @entity4 - controlled @entity3			1
' we are not just going to be waiting for legislation in order to make sure that we 're providing @entity15 the kind of help that they need , ' the president said @entity0 's reliance on his executive powers and his bully pulpit - at the @entity3 it 's called his ‘ pen - and - phone ’ strategy - illustrates the means at his disposal to drive policy but also highlights the limits of his ability to work with @entity11			1
only through legislation can @entity0 obtain some of the most ambitious items on his economic agenda - from a higher minimum wage to universal preschool to an overhaul of immigration laws , three items in his 2013 @entity32 that will make a return appearance in this year 's address			1
as long as @entity4 in @entity11 are unreceptive to his legislative priorities , he will have to settle for more incremental and narrower solutions that do n't necessarily have the staying power and the force of law			2
last week , @entity0 announced that five communities had been designated as ‘ promise zones , ’ fulfilling a goal he set out in his 2013 @entity32 speech			2
last year , @entity0 also announced that he intended to launch three manufacturing hubs like the one he will showcase wednesday in @entity109 , @entity39 but in an example of his limitations , he also called on @entity11 to create 15 more similar hubs , a request that went unanswered			2
@entity0 's determination to use the power of executive orders and administrative actions as well as his decision to convene key figures from private enterprise , education and other interest groups to help advance his agenda underscores some of the built - in powers of the presidency			2
@entity127 - era @entity126 @entity3 chief of staff @entity128 , who is joining the @entity3 as a senior adviser , has long pressed @entity0 to use his executive authority to get around congressional opposition			0
@entity128 co-authored a report in 2010 for the liberal @entity134 that was essentially a treatise on presidential authority			0
it argued that both presidents @entity138 and @entity127 had enacted aspects of their agendas even in the face of a divided @entity11			0
‘ the upshot : @entity11 gridlock does not mean the federal government stands still , ’ @entity128 wrote			0
‘ this administration has a similar opportunity to use available executive authorities while also working with @entity11 where possible			0
’ can do it all alone : @entity0 urged @entity11 to extend unemployment insurance and pass immigration reform as well as help bring down skyrocketing college tuition			1
