@entity15 , 25 , and younger sister @entity1 , 21 , both of @entity13 , @entity14 , agreed to let their bank accounts be used to accept thousands of pounds in stolen money after the victims were conned out of over £ 36,000 over the telephone by a fraudster posing as a policeman			1

he urged the elderly couple they needed to transfer their money into various accounts ' for their own security			1
' the caller even pretended he knew of a list of previous transactions the elderly couple had made , initially rattling off eight incorrect withdrawals before correctly guessing a £ 50 shopping bill at @entity46			1
consequently the couple were persuaded to go to their local @entity48 and make transfers from their account and makes others from their @entity54 savings totalling £ 36,140 to other accounts			1
