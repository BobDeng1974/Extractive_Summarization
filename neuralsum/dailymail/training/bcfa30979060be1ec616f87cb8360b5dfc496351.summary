by @entity0 published : 21:00 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 04:16 est , 31 january 2013 patients are having to wait five and a half hours in ambulances parked outside @entity3 because there are not enough beds			1
some relatives are arriving at hospital to visit their loved ones only to find they are still ‘ queued up ’ outside the main entrance			0
last week some 4,500 patients waited in ambulances for at least half an hour before they were admitted			1
waiting time : last week some 4,500 patients waited in ambulances for at least half an hour before they were admitted , according to figures obtained by @entity15 since the beginning of november there have been more than 68,000 such cases , a rise of a third compared to the same period last year			1
figures obtained by @entity15 show that one patient brought in by @entity21 in the last two months was made to wait 5 hours and 42 minutes			1
another taken to hospital by @entity24 waited five hours and five minutes			1
warning : shadow health secretary @entity25 said : ' these chaotic scenes in @entity3 take us straight back to the bad old days of the mid- 1990s ' but there is concern that keeping ambulances outside hospitals for so long puts other patients waiting for help at risk			1
one unnamed paramedic , who works in @entity36 said : ‘ someone will die this winter as a result of no ambulance being available at the time of the emergency			0
it is not a matter of if , but when			0
’ shadow health secretary @entity25 said : ‘ these chaotic scenes in @entity3 take us straight back to the bad old days of the mid- 1990s			1
‘ up and down the country , ambulances are unable to dispatch patients , hospitals are full to bursting and people are waiting on trolleys in corridors			2
‘ the government must take urgent action to ensure all @entity53 have enough staff to provide safe standards of patient care and meet national standards			2
’ another unnamed paramedic , who works in @entity59 said : ‘ families of sick people arrive at hospitals and expect to find them in a bed , but they are still outside in an ambulance			0
the frustration of ambulance staff is beyond belief ’ many emergency departments have become increasingly overstretched over the last few years and at times they are just too busy to admit new patients			2
but there is also concern that staff are deliberately making patients wait outside so they can meet targets and avoid fines			1
the rules state that hospitals ensure that at least 95 per cent of patients spend no more than four hours in @entity3 before they are discharged or taken to other wards			1
yet the clock only starts once patients are admitted , so managers will be inclined to leave them outside when they are very busy			2
delay : one patient brought in by @entity21 in the last two months was made to wait 5 hours and 42 minutes @entity83 , chief executive of the @entity84 , said : ‘ the public will be deeply concerned by these figures , and deserve to expect the quickest access to @entity3 possible			1
‘ long periods of waiting in an ambulance clearly adds to the stress and discomfort patients are already experiencing			2
‘ the government needs to act to address the severe service pressures that lead to these unacceptable bottlenecks			0
’ @entity97 figures show that the number of emergency admissions has risen by 8 per cent in a year to 17.6 million			0
this rise has partly been blamed on the failure of @entity102 out - of - hours services as well as the increasing elderly population			0
meanwhile officials are considering renaming @entity3 units either ‘ 999 ’ or ‘ 111 ’ departments			0
a report from @entity109 recommends that all emergency departments are classified into treating either emergency cases or just urgent			0
those responsible for emergency care would be known as 999 units , while those looking after urgent cases would be 111 centres			0
a @entity119 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity97 is seeing an extra one million more patients in @entity3 compared to two years ago and despite the additional pressure overall it is coping well			0
