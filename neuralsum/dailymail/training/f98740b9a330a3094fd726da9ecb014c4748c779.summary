the nearly four - minute footage , which features bikini - clad models , has been taken off the air after an online petition was launched calling it sexist			1
however , the airline says the removal of the @entity11 50th anniversary in - flight safety demonstration had nothing to do with public pressure			1
in the footage , the half - naked women advise passengers of the safety procedures on board the plane , and they can be seen flicking their hair suggestively , as well as being ogled at by @entity32 men			1
it also includes a scene where women are looking at their reflections in a mirror while wearing oxygen masks			2
the petitioner said the video , featuring half - naked women carrying out the safety procedures in a suggestive manner , made women uncomfortable , including staff members			1
