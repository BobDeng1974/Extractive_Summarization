@entity0 has pulled out of his @entity2 title eliminator with @entity3 to instead fight for the @entity6 @entity5 belt			1
@entity7 was due to face @entity3 in @entity8 on october 25 but will now tackle @entity9			1
the light - welterweight has won his first nine fights since turning professional			1
@entity0 ( left ) is hoping a @entity5 fight will act as a springboard in his boxing career stalker , pictured fighting @entity16 in march 2013 , pulled out of a fight with @entity3 stalker , second in from the left , captained @entity24 's @entity23 boxing team and he told @entity25 : ' it 's potentially a massive springboard for my career and one that gives me the chance to become one of the top 15 ranked boxers in the world			1
' i was originally scheduled to be fighting @entity3 for a @entity2 title eliminator and i know he will probably be upset by the disruption this causes to his plans but i believe this could be a more rewarding fight for my career and hopefully he will recognise that			2
' @entity3 would have been training hard and it 's still a fight i would like to take should he become @entity2 champion			2
the reality is the fight with him was not a final eliminator and would not guarantee a @entity2 title fight even if i had won			0
i could be waiting around for another six months for the chance			0
' at my age , 30 , i ca n't afford to wait and that 's why this has to be the right step now			0
' i do believe the @entity6 @entity5 can act as a quicker springboard for me to be fighting as a top 10 ranked fighter and it 's too good an opportunity to turn down			0
