the men battle it out with the shark , in a of man vs nature scenario a number of shark ' bites ' will cause dramatic escalations of policy response , for example , the kill order instituted in 2011 after the idea that one ' rogue ' shark may have been responsible for a number of attacks			2

a @entity111 boat was dispatched to try to kill the shark , but it was not successful			0
doctor @entity114 , of the @entity115 , said : ' in particular , the @entity119 's current ' @entity117 ' policy to catch and kill ' rogue ' sharks is predicated on @entity121 fiction			0
' this policy is using myths as the basis for killing sharks that are protected by law and which provides no real beach safety			1
' this fiction serves an important political purpose because films allow politicians to rely on familiar narratives following shark bites to blame individual sharks in order to make the events governable and to trump evidence - based science			2
' the message from this research is that politicians do not have a right to their own set of scientific facts about sharks , no matter how popular the movie			2

' this research therefore offers broader implications for policy analysis			0
' it identifies a worrying style of policy making where widely known fiction can be used to navigate the attribution of blame and to prescribe policy responses			0
