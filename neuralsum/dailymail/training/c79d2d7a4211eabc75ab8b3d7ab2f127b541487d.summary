the easy thing to do would have been to let someone else step up			0
with time ticking by and a game slipping away , @entity2 knew exactly what was at stake when @entity6 won a corner			1
this was their last chance to salvage a point against @entity12 and the wrong delivery would have been greeted with a mix of derision and exasperation by the @entity17			1
those without sufficient mental strength would have been inclined to pass on such responsibility			0
@entity2 's corner is headed home by @entity23 as @entity6 rescued a point against @entity12 @entity2 has been under pressure since his big - money move to @entity6 this summer from @entity27 @entity2 , however , did not flinch			1
he ended up delivering the perfect set - piece , inviting @entity23 to thunder in a header and secure a 2 - 2 draw			1
if the centre back ’s goal on sunday has the potential to change @entity6 ’s season , the assist could be vital for the man who provided it			1
things have not been straight - forward for @entity2 since his £ 23.7million summer switch from @entity27			1
he has sat out big games , nursed injuries and struggled for form but his persistence and determination can not be questioned			2
the evidence was there for all to see last sunday when it mattered			2
‘ when you ’re not playing well and results are n’t going well , it ’s easy to hide and not want the ball , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ but that ’s where you have to work through because eventually it will click			0
something good will happen , you will gain confidence and you ’ll have a good impact			0
’ @entity23 celebrates with @entity2 as the stoppage - time goal provided @entity6 with some momentum having beaten @entity60 in the @entity61 , @entity6 are trying to put together a string of results @entity2 celebrates with @entity64 after the winger scored against @entity60 last week few would dispute that @entity2 , who has been playing with broken ribs , would benefit from a change of fortune ; they would also find it difficult to argue with the fact he has looked a different player since @entity73 reverted to a 3 - 4 - 3 formation and let @entity6 attack once more			1
there have been signs over the past fortnight that , perhaps , @entity6 are about to leave behind the form that made their autumn so wretched			2
the atmosphere at @entity82 was certainly lifted by the manner in which they attacked @entity12 from the start			2
a shortage of confidence , undoubtedly , had been an issue for @entity6 ’s players — not just @entity2 — but they now have a prime opportunity to start building momentum , given their festive fixture list begins on @entity94 against @entity95 at @entity96 and includes home dates with @entity98 and @entity99			1
‘ i think we ’re getting a bit of confidence and rhythm in our game , ’ said the 26 - year - old , who celebrated his first wedding anniversary on christmas eve			2
the @entity109 midfielder celebrates his first @entity6 goal , against @entity111 in october it has been a difficult start to life at @entity82 for @entity2 , but he is beginning to show why he cost so much ‘ we ’re causing teams problems , so we can gain belief from that			1
the lads were lacking a bit of confidence			0
‘ that comes with disappointing results			0
anyone in the game will tell you that you have these points in your career when you have got to show a bit of bottle , where you ’ve got to go looking for the ball			0
we ’ve had that and it ’s about keeping on going into work , wanting to come back strong			0
‘ there ’s been a lot of talk in - house that we have to stick together as a squad			0
when you ’re not playing well , everyone will be up against you , wanting you to slip up			0
so it has been about us sticking together			0
we know we have character and a great dressing room			0
’ what @entity2 says also works in @entity6 ’s favour is the presence of @entity73 , the manager who was so desperate to sign him			1
@entity6 ’s group may have been stung by criticism but @entity73 has ensured they have not lost focus			1
@entity73 has been criticised after his side 's slow start to the season following last year 's success @entity2 insists his manager has been fantastic and believes @entity6 can still have a good season ‘ he ’s been fantastic with me and the group as a whole , ’ @entity2 explained			1
‘ i ’m sure he ’s found it difficult as well			0
you can not always ignore what people write and say			0
but it ’s about sticking together and that ’s what he ’s mentioned — we stick together no matter how many people have their opinions			0
‘ there are reasons ( @entity6 are not fighting for the title like last year ) and people might not like the reasons but it ’s up to us , step by step , to gradually get back to where the lads were last year			2
over the last couple of games i think we have found a system to suit and that ’s credit to the manager			0
’ in @entity73 ' new 3 - 4 - 3 formation @entity2 is starting to rediscover his superb form from @entity27 will 3 - 4 - 3 be the key to @entity6 staging a revival in the new year ? @entity2 will not make any bold declarations but he is quick to point out that the season , come may , might yet be judged as a triumph , given the avenues that are open			1
‘ we ’re in the semi-finals of the @entity61 ( against @entity187 ) — i ca n’t wait for that , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ we ’ve also got a good run of games coming up in the league , where , if we put in performances like we did against @entity12 , we ’ll have a strong chance of picking up points			1

@entity2 has struggled since £ 23.7million to @entity6
but midfielder played *crucial* role in 2 - 2 draw with @entity12 on sunday
@entity2 believes *recent* performances demonstrate new confidence
former @entity27 star says @entity73 has been ' fantastic '
