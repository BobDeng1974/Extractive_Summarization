genetically engineering plants and crops to change their dna has been a cause of much controversy in recent years			1
but new research has found that @entity6 might be making its own @entity8 food , as sweet potatoes have been found to genetically modify themselves			1
and this seems to have been occurring for thousands of years , meaning humans have been unknowingly eating @entity8 foods for much longer than they thought			1
scientists in @entity14 say all sweet potatoes ( stock image shown ) contain ' foreign dna '			1
agrobacterium bacteria in the crop exchanges genes between species			1
this makes sweet potatoes a ' natural genetically modified organism '			1
and humans have been eating it for thousands of years the remarkable finding of ‘ foreign dna ’ in the vegetable shows that it contains a type of natural genetically modified organism ( @entity31 )			1
the research was conducted by scientists from @entity34 in @entity14 and the @entity35 ( @entity36 )			2
sweet potato is one of the most important food crops for human consumption , especially in @entity45 , parts of @entity39 and the @entity40 islands			0
it is one of the earliest domesticated crops with archeological findings in caves of the @entity51 in @entity52 that are 8,000 to 10,000 years old			0
despite the name , sweet potato is not related to potato ; we eat the tuber from potato , while from sweet potato mainly the storage root is eaten			0
other sweet potato parts are edible , such as the leaves			0
it is not the first instance of natural @entity31 to be found , but it is the first in sweet potatoes - a major crop plant			1
and the researchers say sweet potatoes all over the world contain this genetic modification			2
the study focused around bacteria called @entity72 , sometimes referred to as ‘ nature ’s genetic engineer			0
’ it is known to do something called ‘ horizontal gene transfer ’ , which involves exchanging genes between different species - in contrast to normal gene transfer within one species			2
@entity72 is specialised to transfer part of its own dna , called @entity85 , to plants - and it was this @entity85 that was found in sweet potatoes			1
in total the researchers studied 291 samples of sweet potato from the @entity91 , @entity45 , @entity39 and @entity92 , and found evidence of @entity72 in all of them			0
@entity72 is known to do something called ‘ horizontal gene transfer ’ , which involves exchanging genes between different species - in contrast to normal gene transfer within one species			2
this so - called transgenic process is similar to the artificial process induced by humans ( stock image shown ) sweet potato ( shown ) is one of the most important food crops for human consumption , especially in @entity45 , parts of @entity39 and the @entity40 islands			0
it is one of the earliest domesticated crops with archeological findings in caves of the @entity51 in @entity52 that are 8,000 to 10,000 years old ‘ the natural presence of @entity116 in sweet potato and its stable inheritance during evolution is a beautiful example of the possibility of dna exchange across species barriers , ’ said dr @entity113 , one of the researchers involved			1
‘ it demonstrates that genetic modification also happens in nature			0
’ the research suggests that the bacterial @entity85 may have adapted sweet potato for thousands of years in the natural process			2
the transgenic process - a gene that has been transferred naturally - is similar to the artificial process induced by humans			0
however , the difference pointed out by the resarchers is that we can control the man - made process , while the natural process is out of our hands			0
‘ in comparison to " natural " gmos , that are beyond our control , human - made gmos have the advantage that we know exactly which characteristic we add to the plant , ’ said dr @entity113 .			0
