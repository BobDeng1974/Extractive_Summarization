published : 06:16 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 20:27 est , 11 april 2013 a year and a half ago @entity0 was so ill that she was unable to move or breathe for herself			1
with just 12 per cent lung capacity , she was in constant , excruciating pain and doctors had warned her she may not survive much longer			1
but now the @entity5 born 30 - year - old is fighting fit , saying she has never felt better and that she enjoys dancing the night away and taking her dog , @entity7 , for a walk on the beach			2
this dramatic turnaround is all thanks to the double lung transplant that @entity0 underwent in november 2011			1
@entity0 with her husband @entity13 and pet dog , @entity7 , just six months after her transplant she is just one of thousands of @entity16 who have benefited from the 50 per cent increase in organ donation over the past five years , according to new figures released by @entity21 ( @entity21 )			1
there are currently 7,300 patients on the transplant waiting list and 6,000 of those are waiting for new kidneys			1
nearly every donor can provide at least one kidney and usually they will be able to provide two			2
each day three @entity16 die waiting for an organ			1
@entity0 suffers with @entity29 , a genetic condition that affects collagen production			1
it causes tissue , blood vessels and joints in the body to be stretchy and fragile			0
for most people , the condition is n't life - threatening , but if teamed with other conditions , symptoms can be more serious			0
@entity0 suffered with asthma as a child and suffered bouts of pneumonia as a teenager which severely damaged her already fragile lung tissue			1
fragile : @entity0 pictured six months before her double lung transplant road to recovery : @entity0 pictured nine weeks after her organ transplant ‘ the last bout was when i was 18 and i was left very wheezy , ’ says @entity0 , a former administrator			1
‘ i found exercise harder than most but i was able to function and with an asthma pump			2
’ however , over the course of her twenties , @entity0 ’s health deteriorated rapidly			1
doctors regularly tested her lung function and tried to manage her breathlessness but they were unable to stop the steady decline in her ability to breathe			1
‘ it was terrible – imagine pinching your nose and breathing through a straw , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ that was how life was , day in , day out			0
it is really terrifying because your body is starved of oxygen and there ’s nothing you can do			0
’ as her body became increasingly weak , she became prone to infection and developed severe and debilitating panic attacks that left her frightened to leave her house			0
the couple married before @entity0 's transplant because they were unsure of what the outcome would be as @entity0 ( pictured with husband @entity13 ) became more ill , her weight plummeted to just over five stone her skin turned an ashen grey , her weight plummeted to just over five stone and she was eventually fed intravenously in a desperate bid to get her to put on weight so she could grow new lung tissue			1
‘ i was so weak i had to catch a bus to work even though it was only a 15 minute walk away , ’ she says			0
‘ eventually it got to the point where i could n’t even brush my teeth without getting out of breath			0
’ by age 25 , doctors were keen for @entity0 to have a transplant , although she was reluctant to have such a major operation , admitting she was in denial about her grave situation : ‘ you never imagine it will be you and , at the time , i could n’t quite cope with the situation			1
’ in july 2010 @entity0 was put on the organ donor list but had to wait a further 16 months until a suitable pair of lungs – one that matched her size and blood type – came up			1
during this time she became critically ill. throughout this period , she hospitalised at the @entity115 in north west @entity116			0
finally she was placed permanently in intensive care because she repeatedly went into full respiratory arrest and could not breathe without the aid of a lung bypass machine			2
‘ doctors told my family they were not sure how long i would last so my husband @entity13 called my family and they flew over from @entity5 to spend as much time as possible with me before time ran out , ’ she says			2
‘ but by the end of their visit i went into such a severe respiratory arrest i was sedated and put in an artificial coma			0
’ miraculously , during this time a pair of donor lungs that matched @entity0 ’s criteria came up and a week later @entity0 woke up with new lungs			1
new lease of life : @entity0 with husband @entity13 before her operation ( left ) and after , as a bridesmaid in 2012 ( right ) ' my family were so frightened that i might give up the fight that as i slowly came round they kept whispering in my ear “ @entity0 , you ’ve got new lungs			1
it ’s all going to be okay , you ’re going to get better ! ” , ’ she remembers			0
‘ i was very confused because i was on so many drugs but i could hear them			0
’ within hours of the transplant at the @entity149 , @entity0 ’s family were astonished by the visible difference in her health			1
she was still incredibly weak but they could n’t help but be shocked by her suddenly rosy cheeks			0
‘ it took me two days until i could even touch my nose because i was so exhausted , but within three weeks i was taken off a ventilator and able to breathe for myself , ’ explains @entity0			1
‘ i could n’t believe i ’d made it – i was ecstatic			0
’ @entity0 has n’t met her donor ’s family but she knows that her lungs came from a 47 - year - old female			1
she has written to the family and says that every day is a reminder of how she is indebted to the anonymous woman who took the time to put herself on the register			0
‘ my lung function is now 90 per cent and i appreciate every single moment , every single thing			2
i just want to do the woman who helped me proud			0
i want to make sure i make the most of the extra time i ’ve been given			0
’ @entity0 continues to take anti-rejection drugs , steroids and a number of other medications to ensure her new lungs function properly for as long as possible			1
she says she is optimistic about the future			2
‘ i can honestly say i ’ve never felt better in my life – i ’ve booked a holiday to @entity180 with my husband and i ’ve even applied for a job			0
normal life has never felt so good			0
’ to register for organ donation visit @entity184 to read more about @entity0 ’s story visit her blog @entity188 the sharp rise in organ donation is largely due to the creation of a network of specialist nurses who support bereaved families and discuss the possibility of organ donation with them			2
specialist nurses are one of a number of recommendations made in 2008 by the @entity200 , following a decade of almost no increase in the number of donated organs			2
the taskforce also pushed for the creation of specialist organ retrieval teams and wider promotion and campaigning around the importance of organ donation			0
giving and taking : the number of organs being donated is at an all time high these recommendations have led to a sharp increase in organ donors across the @entity16 – a rise of 49 per cent rise in @entity217 , of 16 per cent in @entity218 , of 74 per cent increase in @entity220 and an astounding 82 per cent increase in @entity222			1
consequently there has been a 31 per cent boost in the number of people receiving a life - saving or enhancing organ transplant since 2008			2
‘ this is an outstanding achievement that few thought possible at the time this ambition was set , ’ said @entity228 , chairman of @entity21			0
‘ it is the result of the hard work and dedication of staff in hospitals and communities across the country			0
‘ we must also share our heartfelt thanks with every family who , at a great time of sadness , supported their loves one 's wish to donate their organs and transform the lives of up to nine other people			2
’ despite the increase in organ donors , the numbers of families refusing to grant consent remains among the highest in @entity257 , and @entity21 is calling for more to be done			2
in addition to this , lack of organ donation awareness amongst the black and @entity261 community particularly needs to targeted , according to the @entity21			0
despite being three times more likely to need a transplant , only three per cent of this section of the population is on the organ donation register .			0

in 2011 @entity270 , 30 , was close to death because her lungs failed
doctors *feared* for her future unless a suitable donor could be found
but now , after a double lung transplant , @entity0 feels ' better than ever '
new figures show that more @entity16 than ever are donating their organs
but doctors warn that donors are needed as three patients die daily waiting
