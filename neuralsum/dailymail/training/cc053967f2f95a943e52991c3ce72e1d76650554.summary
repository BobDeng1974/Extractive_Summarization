for the the last few decades @entity0 has spent billions of dollars on a variety of missions to @entity3 to find out if the planet might once have been habitable			1
but has a @entity6 blogger found evidence for past life on @entity3 in the form of a human face - like rock hidden in an old @entity0 photo ? the answer , of course , is an emphatic ' no ' , but that has n't stopped the @entity16 enthusiast from suggesting that the rock may be a sign the planet was once inhabited			1
the image comes from the @entity30 - based agency 's first rover on @entity3 , called @entity31 , which landed on @entity3 on 4 july 1997			1
in the image the rock seems to have a human - like appearance on his website @entity35 mr @entity21 says he has ‘ found a new face ’ on @entity3			1
the discovery was seemingly made by the @entity31 on @entity3 back on 22 july 1997 , but not unearthed by mr @entity21 until now			1
in a video he expresses bafflement that @entity0 has pointed out features on @entity3 , including the face , with arrows in the image			1
@entity31 was a rover that travelled with the @entity47 mission			2
it landed on @entity3 on 4 july 1997 and became the first rover to operate on the surface of the red planet			1
it was designed to last just seven days on @entity3 but stayed active for 83 @entity3 days , eventually losing communication with @entity54 on 27 september 1997			2
in its time on @entity3 the rover travelled a bit more than 330ft ( 100 metres ) the rover returned more than 550 images and , through chemical analyses of rocks and soil , also suggested that @entity3 may have once been warm and wet			0
‘ this rover found some objects and @entity0 was pointing them out with different arrows			2
‘ i was just thinking “ wow @entity0 ’s really not helping us at all find any of these objects on @entity3 ” and bam , there is an arrow pointing right to the face			2
’ the actual ‘ face ’ spotted by mr @entity21 is in the bottom left of the main image			1
it appears to bear a resemblance to a human face with a nose , chin , eyes and so on			0
sadly for mr @entity21 and similar @entity16 enthusiasts , this rock like so many others has a simple explanation			1
namely , it is simply a chance alignment that tricks the brain into thinking it is seeing a face - known as face pareidolia			2
mr @entity21 also added : ‘ of course @entity0 noticed it , but they did n’t label the reason for the arrow			1
’ however , looking up the image in @entity0 ’s library of images reveals the true reasons for the arrows			0
mr @entity21 says this indicates the planet was once inhabited			1
however the rock is nothing more than a case of pareidolia - when our brain tricks us into see human faces in objects like @entity106 in toast			1
@entity0 also said the arrows simply showed different types of rock the image was taken by @entity0 's @entity31 on 22 july 1997			1
this particular rock had an unweathered surface that appeared to have been unaffected by wind on @entity3 - but it was not a sign that some sort of intelligent civilisation carved a face into the rock @entity121 is the psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimulus			2
it is a form of @entity127 , which is when people see patterns or connections in random , unconnected data			0
there have been multiple occasions when people have claimed to see religious images and themes in unexpected places , especially the faces of religious figures			0
many involve images of @entity106 , the @entity142 and the word @entity144			0
for example , in september 2007 a callus on a tree resembled a monkey , leading believers in @entity150 to pay homage to the @entity153 god			0
another famous instance was when @entity142 ’s face was a grilled cheese sandwich			0
images of @entity106 have even been spotted inside the lid of a jar of @entity160 and in a potato			0
‘ the large rounded rocks in the distance , marked by the red arrows , are comparable to " @entity165 " ’ said @entity0			0
@entity165 , found previously by @entity31 , was the first rock on @entity3 found to be made of basalt , which suggested the planet was once volcanic			1
its smoothness also hinted at a wet past for the planet			0
‘ a second population of smaller , angular rocks ( blue arrows ) in the foreground have unweathered surfaces even on the downwind side , except where covered on their tops by drift ’ @entity0 continued			0
‘ the third kind of rock ( white arrows ) is white and flat , and includes " @entity185 " in the foreground			0
’ ‘ @entity185 ’ was a pink rock that was coated with a crusty substance and contained a lot of rust			0
the agency explains how the image is a 360 - degree colour gallery pan looking to the northeast of @entity3			2
in it the colours have been exaggerated to highlight the differences between rocks and soils			0
the image is actually fairly remarkable as it is one of the first images ever taken by a rover - in this case @entity31 - on @entity3			1
@entity31 ( seen here with the @entity165 rock ) was a rover that travelled with the @entity47 mission			2
it landed on @entity3 on 4 july 1997 and became the first rover to operate on the surface of the red planet			1
it was designed to last just seven days on @entity3 but stayed active for 83 @entity3 days until 27 september 1997			0

@entity21 claims he has found signs of life in an old @entity0 photo
image comes from the @entity30 - based agency 's first rover on @entity3
this was called @entity31 and it landed on the planet on 4 july 1997
in the image a rock seems to have a human - like appearance
mr @entity21 says this indicates the planet was once inhabited
however the rock is nothing more than a case of pareidolia - when our brain tricks us into see human faces in objects like @entity106 in toast
