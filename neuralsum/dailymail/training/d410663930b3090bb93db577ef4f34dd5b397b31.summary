by @entity0 published : 06:05 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 06:10 est , 21 may 2013 a mother says she is a ' ticking time bomb ' after being diagnosed with a rare condition that condemns her to living with eight tumours			1
@entity6 , 25 , has five non-cancerous tumours in her brain and three on her spine - and doctors have warned her that more could develop at any time			1
ms @entity6 , from @entity12 , was diagnosed with life - threatening condition neurofibromatosis type two ( @entity14 ) , which causes nervous system tumours			1
@entity6 ( pictured with son @entity16 , 4 ) has neurofibromatosis type two which causes tumours to develop in the nervous system @entity14 causes tumours that grow on the nerves responsible for hearing and balance - causing symptoms including hearing loss , tinnitus and balance problems			1
tumours can also develop inside the brain or spinal cord and in the nerves to the arms and legs			1
these can cause symptoms such as weakness in the arms and legs and persistent headaches			0
ms @entity6 said : ‘ the condition makes me a ticking timebomb , really			1
the tumours can flare up any time , any day , for the rest of my life - that 's something i can never escape from			1
‘ doctors keep an eye on the tumours but it 's just like playing @entity48 roulette - you just do n't know what will happen next			1
‘ it 's made me a lot a stronger but each appointment is nerve - racking to say the least			2
i never know if i 'm going to come out being diagnosed with potentially fatal cancer			0
ms @entity6 ( pictured with her mother , @entity54 ) currently has five tumours in her brain and three in her spine but doctors have warned her that more could develop at any time ms @entity6 has been told that there is a 50 per cent chance that her son @entity16 will have inherited the genetic mutation that causes the tumours to develop @entity14 is caused by a genetic mutation and in half of cases the mutation is passed from parent to child			1
on other occasions , such as in ms @entity6 's case , the mutation develops on its own in a child with no family history of the condition			1
there is no cure for @entity14 so treatment involves managing the symptoms as they occur - for example , surgery can be used to remove tumours but it can cause deafness or facial weakness			2
she has had surgery to remove a lump from her ear but she now has to decide whether to have one of her brain tumours removed and risk deafness prognosis for @entity14 patients varies significantly as some people 's symptoms get worse rapidly while in others the condition progresses slowly			1
the average life expectancy for someone with the condition is 65			0
ms @entity6 was devastated to learn that she might have passed the condition onto her four - year - old son @entity16 , but she will have to wait until he is 18 before doctors know if he has inherited it			1
she said : ‘ it 's a condition that affects one in 35,000 people - now i know what i 'm facing and i hope to raise awareness about it			1
‘ my son has a 50 per cent chance of inheriting it			0
i have to wait 15 years until i know if i 've given to my son - that 's something no parent should face			1
‘ i wo n't be having any more children unfortunately , i ca n't face passing it on			2
’ ms @entity6 now faces the difficult decision of whether or not to have a fast - growing tumour removed from her brain			1
the surgery would leave her deaf in her left ear but without it she will require monthly treatment			0
she has already had a lump removed from behind her ear			0
she said : ‘ at the moment i 'm swaying more to towards the treatment as it 's such a drastic change to lose my hearing			2
‘ the medical staff will keep tabs on the growth rate of the tumour			0
it 's something i 'm going to have with me for the rest of my life			0
@entity134 is of the essence so i will be making the decision as soon as i can really			0
‘ when i first heard about it i had no idea what it was but i 've had so many people wish me well - i just want to help raise awareness for it and encourage others to have the tests			0
’ ms @entity6 's fiancé , @entity146 , and her mother , @entity54 , have supported her throughout the ordeal - going to every scan , medical appointment and treatment session			1
ms @entity6 said : ‘ i only found the tumour after i felt a lump behind my ear			2
it was terrifying ; the thought of having cancer it just hits you			0
‘ my family have been there for me at every waking moment			0
people know i 'm strong and determined and just deal with it			0
’ @entity14 is a gene mutation that causes tumours to grow on the nerves responsible for hearing and balance			1
these cause symptoms including hearing loss , tinnitus and balance problems			1
tumours can also develop inside the brain or spinal cord and in the nerves to the arms and legs			2
these can cause symptoms such as weakness in the arms and legs and persistent headaches			0
the tumours are normally non-cancerous			0
@entity14 is caused by a genetic mutation and in half of cases the mutation is passed from parent to child			0
on other occasions the mutation develops on its own in a child with no family history of the condition			0
there is no cure for @entity14 so treatment involves managing the symptoms as they occur - for example , surgery can be used to remove tumours but it can cause deafness or facial weakness			2
prognosis for @entity14 patients varies significantly as some people 's symptoms get worse rapidly while in others the condition progresses slowly			2
the average life expectancy for someone with the condition is 65			0
@entity14 affects about one in every 35,000 people			2

@entity6 has neurofibromatosis , which causes nervous system tumours
has five brain tumours and three on her spine - more could grow at any time
condition affects 1 in 35,000 and causes hearing loss and balance problems
