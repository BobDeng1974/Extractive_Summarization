by @entity1 reporter last updated at 2:19 pm on 7th july 2011 mps and council officials in @entity4 have expressed their disbelief after it emerged that disgraced former peer @entity6 is still receiving his £ 11,500 councillor allowance despite being jailed for fiddling his parliamentary expenses			1
the shamed lord , real name @entity6 , 70 , was jailed for nine months last week after he was found guilty of illegally claiming £ 13,379 in parliamentary expenses			1
but despite the scandal he has still not resigned his post at @entity15			1
still being paid : @entity6 , centre , remains in his post at @entity15 despite being jailed over his expenses claims @entity6 , a former pig farmer from @entity19 , near @entity20 in @entity4 , was convicted in may of six counts of false accounting relating to his @entity24 expenses			1
however , despite being jailed he has retained his place as @entity27 for the village of @entity29 - and is still receiving his councillor allowance of £ 11,500			2
on @entity15 's website it states that councillors receive their allowance so they can do their duties , which includes ' being accessible and available to all residents in their electoral division '			1
but although he is under pressure to resign from his post the council have said they are powerless to suspend or axe @entity6 until an appeal against his conviction is complete			2
councillor @entity43 , @entity43 deputy leader on @entity15 , said the former @entity45 peer should do the ' honourable thing ' and step down			1
he said , ' it can not be right that @entity6 will continue to receive his £ 11,500 a year allowance whilst serving his prison sentence			0
' he can not represent people in his ward from a prison cell so he should not be a councillor			0
he should do the honourable thing and resign his seat and save further embarrassment to @entity15			1
' this would cause a by - election to be held , which would enable the 13,500 electors of @entity29 to be properly represented again at @entity61 as soon as possible , ' @entity57 added			0
" the @entity63 said @entity6 's case was one of the most clear cut examples of expenses fraud so he does n't have a leg to stand on			0
' @entity69 , mp for @entity70 , said : ' i think most people would be amazed that someone in prison can remain a councillor			0
' the judge has sentenced him to a term of imprisonment which should be an automatic disqualification			0
' @entity79 , a spokeswoman for the @entity80 , said : ' it 's absurd to have a county councillor being paid while he is in jail			0
how can he be serving taxpayers while he is in jail ? ' it 's unacceptable that he 's allowed to stay in his position once he 's been convicted as a criminal			0
there 's no way he should be allowed to continue as a county councillor			0
' claims : @entity6 stayed at his home in @entity20 , @entity4 , while claiming for overnight stays for his work at the @entity24 @entity15 has confirmed that @entity6 is still being paid councillor expenses pending the outcome of his appeal			1
a spokeswoman said : ' @entity15 is now awaiting the outcome of @entity6 's application for leave to appeal his conviction			1
' in the meantime we are continuing to co-operate with the police over the ongoing @entity4 investigation and it would not be appropriate for us to comment until that is complete			0
' @entity6 was found guilty of six counts of false accounting in may and joins four ex-mps and a fellow member of the @entity24 convicted of dishonestly obtaining thousands of pounds from the taxpayer			1
@entity6 , an unmarried @entity115 opposition frontbencher and former leader of @entity15 , has lodged an appeal			1
he denied fraudulently claiming parliamentary expenses totalling nearly £ 14,000 between march 2006 and may 2009			0
the charges relate to six individual one month periods			0
the peer claimed £ 13,379 in parliamentary expenses for overnight stays in @entity124 when he was not in the capital , as well as £ 382 in train fares and £ 147 in mileage by doubling the seven - mile distance from his house to the railway station			2
he told his trial that he treated the @entity24 expenses for staying overnight in @entity124 as an allowance for living outside the capital and spent just ' a minute a month ' completing his claim forms			1
he alleged that most other peers treated the @entity24 as a ' club ' , turning up there for only 10 minutes to claim their daily allowance			1
prison term : @entity6 was jailed for nine months despite claims he was in poor health the shamed peer insisted his parliamentary duties left him thousands of pounds out of pocket and said he ' averaged out ' his claims to recoup some of the money he spent			1
when he was questioned by detectives , he told them to look at the records of other peers and claimed he was not the only one claiming expenses in this way			0
@entity153 told the trial that public service was his life and he worked very long hours on @entity24 and county council business			2
he said he re-mortgaged his bungalow to fight the case and was living on a modest pension because he ' never got round to signing the forms ' for the local government pension to which he was entitled			0
but prosecutors rejected the peer 's ' feeble excuse ' for his ' blatantly dishonest ' behaviour , saying that peers are meant to serve the public and ' not top up their income at the public 's expense '			2
four former @entity172 - @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 - have already received prison terms for fiddling their parliamentary expenses			2
@entity174 has already been released from jail , and @entity173 was freed from @entity181 open prison , near @entity182 , @entity183 , on the day @entity6 was convicted after serving just a quarter of his 18 - month sentence			0
another @entity45 peer , lord @entity186 , was jailed for 12 months and faces being suspended from the @entity24			1
in mitigation , defence counsel @entity188 said @entity6 had been convicted of offences over a period of six out of 72 months			2
he said : ' he is convicted of dishonesty in six months of the prosecution 's own choosing out of 72 months when the reality is that this man has actually given his own money for public service for all the 40 years he has been involved in it			2
' mr @entity188 said it was ' unjust and cruel ' to jail @entity6 because of his old age and ill health .			0
