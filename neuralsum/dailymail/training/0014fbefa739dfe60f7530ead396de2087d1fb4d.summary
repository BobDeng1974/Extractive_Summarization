the 46 - year - old is currently doing a stand - up tour of @entity17 and arrived in @entity18 at the start of his tour on @entity21			1
to give @entity1 listeners some context on his podcast he referenced the @entity26 song @entity24			1
he quipped that rather than give the land back to the @entity31 people as the song argues , it ’d be better to ‘ just give them casinos like we did ( in the @entity1 ) , and get on with your lives ’			1
the comedian was poking fun at the @entity26 song and @entity17 ’s history on its national day , but @entity50 of the @entity51 was n’t laughing			1
mr @entity50 , who has said financial compensation should be included as part of the government ’s apology to the stolen generations , reacted angrily to the comic ’s comments			2
‘ this bloke is saying that if @entity31 people get their land back they wo n’t make any economic benefit out of it , ’ mr @entity50 said			1
‘ it ’s like if we did get the land back we ’d just sit on it and do nothing			0
it is just plain racist and not funny at all			0
’ the @entity26 song @entity24 was referenced by mr @entity10 as he riffed about @entity17 on his podcast mr @entity10 does a popular weekly podcast and on monday admitted that he did n’t know what @entity21 was or anything about @entity17			1
‘ i know that they have a very similar history to the @entity1 in that , you know , they had some englishmen come over here			0
and there was people already over here , so that was a problem , ’ he said on his podcast ‘ they dealt with it in a way that centuries later musicians with guilt would write songs about			0
’ the @entity1 stand - up comedian joked that @entity17 had the same kind of history as the @entity1 as ' they had some englishmen come over here ' he then broke into singing lines of the song @entity24 by @entity26 , like ‘ out where the river broke ’ and ‘ the time has come ’			1
mr @entity10 then referred to the band ’s lead singer @entity104 , who went on to be a cabinet minister for @entity107 under @entity108 and then @entity109			2
‘ remember that guy ? he said ( in the song ) : ‘ the time has come			0
to say fair ’s fair			0
to pay our share ’ , ' mr @entity10 explained			2
‘ then at the end he ’d go : ‘ let ’s give it back ! ’ but give what back ? the f * * * ing land ? and displace nine million people ? ‘ it ’s over			1
it ’s a terrible thing that happened			0
just give them casinos like we did ( in the @entity1 ) , and get on with your lives			0

‘ i ’m not judging you guys			0
we got the same history and worse in the @entity1 , ’ he said			0
however , mr @entity50 still believed that more respect should have been shown to @entity17 ’s chequered past			1
@entity50 of the @entity51 is not a fan of mr @entity10 's humour however ‘ it ’s still pretty offensive			2
the hypocrisy of people like this who say that that @entity31 or any @entity31 people keep looking backwards are the same people who celebrate an event like @entity21 that happened 220 years ago , which celebrates the arrival of white people , ’ mr @entity50 said			2
‘ it ’s hypocritical of him			0
