@entity1 rep. @entity0 has reimbursed the @entity2 for $ 40,000 worth of renovations he made to his congressional office photos taken in january of @entity0 's new office in the @entity20 , which was designed to resemble the dining room of the @entity22 show @entity7 @entity0 , a rising star in the @entity23 , has been under scrutiny for using taxpayer money to pay for the redecorating , as well as using his official and campaign funds for flights on donor - owned planes and concert tickets			1
the @entity32 was first to describe the office decorations in early february			0
a watchdog group has since requested a @entity13 ethics review of the congressman 's spending			0
@entity0 's office said friday his payments made good on an earlier promise to personally shoulder the costs of the office renovation			2
@entity0 wrote two checks - for $ 25,000 on february 4 and $ 10,000 on february 6 - to @entity44 , owner of @entity9			1
he wrote a third check for $ 5,000 on thursday			2
' @entity47 has fulfilled his commitment to pay for all the renovation costs , ' his office said friday in a prepared statement			0
it said that while congressional office costs are usually paid from office expense accounts , ' the congressman believed it appropriate to pay these costs himself			0
' over the last month , he has paid for his decor with three checks to @entity44 , owner of @entity9 : one check on february 4 for $ 25,000 , one on february 6 for $ 10,000 and one on thursday for $ 5,000 @entity0 is in his fourth term representing the @entity64 and @entity65 areas			1
this week , @entity0 brought on board a team of campaign finance lawyers and public relations experts to address the controversy about his expenses			0
his financial charges - including the use of his donors ' private aircraft and concert tickets - were detailed by the @entity11 and other news organizations since news of the decoration work became public			2
an @entity11 review this week identified at least a dozen flights worth more than $ 40,000 on contributors ' planes since mid- 2011 , tracking @entity0 's reliance on the aircraft partly through the congressman 's pictures uploaded to his @entity89 account			1
the @entity11 extracted hidden location data associated with each image ; it then correlated it with flight records showing airport stopovers and expenses later billed for air travel against @entity0 's office and campaign records			2

@entity0 's financial charges have been made public after organizations questioned what his expenses were going toward			0
he has spent thousands on concerts and car mileage reimbursements when @entity0 's office originally made headlines , the congressman would n't reveal if the inspiration for the room was the hit tv show @entity7 ( pictured above ) but most of the flights @entity0 covered with office funds occurred before the @entity13 changed its rules in january 2013			1
those earlier rules prohibited lawmakers from using those accounts to pay for flights on private aircraft , allowing payments only for federally licensed charter and commercial flights			0
@entity0 previously told the @entity11 he travels frequently throughout his @entity128 ' to stay connected with my constituents , ' and that he takes compliance with congressional funding rules seriously			0

' the popular @entity22 show depicts the lives of aristocratic families and their servants in 1920s @entity155			0
