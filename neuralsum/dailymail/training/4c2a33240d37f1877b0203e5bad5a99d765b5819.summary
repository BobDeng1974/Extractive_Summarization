the group had been sailing from @entity8 to @entity9 , which is in @entity11 territory , when their leaky fishing vessel came to grief			1
its upturned hull , surrounded by debris , was found - before several of the bodies were located			2
many asylum seekers hope for a better life in @entity11 and surrounding territories - sometimes with devastating consequences			2
this boat was driven on to the rocks surrounding @entity9 in december 2010 while most of those on board were men , the passengers who had set out looking for a new life in @entity11 included women and children			1
' this is another terrible tragedy - another terrible reminder how dangerous these journeys are , ' said @entity11 's @entity33 minister @entity32			2

what has been described as a ' debris field ' - including lifejackets - was found			0
at least 27 people died when this boat was smashed against rocks by the waves off of @entity9 in 2010 then as night fell , a body was seen from the air , but the crew of the naval ship were unable to find it			1

aircraft and rescue vessels were heading to the area			0
the asylum seeker debate - sparked by the @entity94 's ' open door ' policy in contrast to the tough stance of the previous @entity98 government of @entity99 - has made prime minister @entity100 unpopular among many @entity11			0
tens of thousands have reached @entity11 territory since the @entity94 government came to power in 2007 - since the beginning of 2013 more than 11,300 asylum seekers have reached @entity11 , 660 arriving in the first week of june alone			0
