by @entity0 for the @entity1 and @entity2 for the @entity1 extremist taskforce ? @entity4 set up a team after @entity6 was hacked to death by cleaver - wielding fanatics in broad daylight last may ministers faced a storm of criticism last night over the failure to halt the radicalisation of @entity15 amid claims up to 2,000 may have travelled to @entity17 and @entity18 to fight			1
@entity19 was forced to admit plans to prevent youths being brainwashed by jihadists , ordered following the horrific murder of @entity6 , have been gathering dust for months			1
prime minister @entity4 set up an ‘ extremism taskforce ’ after the 25 - year - old @entity26 soldier was hacked to death by cleaver - wielding fanatics in broad daylight outside @entity30 , @entity32 - east @entity31 , in may last year			1
but as anger mounted over the beheading of @entity38 journalist @entity37 by a masked @entity40 militant with an @entity42 accent , it emerged none of the group ’s main recommendations had been implemented			1
the extraordinary development fuelled concern the @entity48 was failing to get a grip on fanatics who were ‘ hijacking ’ @entity26 youths			1
@entity52 , @entity53 mp for @entity54 , said the true number of young @entity26 muslims who have gone to fight with @entity40 was far higher than the official estimate of 500			1
he said : ‘ it is closer to 2,000			2
i know there are still people going			2
' there are no real effective controls at the borders , either on exit or coming in			2
' when the prime minister says there is a real threat to the @entity26 he is right , but what is he doing to stop that ? he ’s doing nothing			1
’ mr @entity4 ’s taskforce reported back in early december with a long list of recommendations , including the introduction of ‘ terror @entity76 ’ to curb the activities of hate preachers , bans on groups that ‘ seek to undermine democracy or use hate speech ’ and new powers to make it easier for the @entity84 to close down groups raising funds for terror organisations			1
but none of the key findings has been acted upon			2
only a crackdown on extremist websites is under way but even then only 57 sites have been shut down			2
in a much - vaunted speech on terrorism in @entity97 in 2011 , mr @entity4 also pledged to make @entity26 ‘ a lot less ’ tolerant of @entity99 fanatics who whip up hatred			1
he argued that the @entity26 had been too passive and said the @entity105 must ‘ wake up to what is happening in our own countries ’			1
the @entity26 @entity106 ( left ) who murdered journalist @entity37 is one of at least 500 @entity26 fighting for @entity110 - and 250 of them are believed to back already , including @entity111 ( right ) , 32 @entity112 , 31 , became the first @entity113 to be found guilty of travelling to @entity18 to fight			1
he failed the selection process to join extremists and blew cash borrowed from family to get there on foreign holidays but three years later , not a single strategy document appears to have been published by the government outlining what it plans to do about the problem			0
@entity125 , managing director of counter-extremism think - tank @entity126 , said : ‘ there is clearly a problem			0
‘ at least 500 people are fighting in @entity18 and @entity17 and a lot more sympathise with the jihadists ’ view and that is disturbing			1
‘ the government has not really got a grip on it			0
the taskforce is a prime example of that			2
some very good statements are made but nothing happens , even though huge numbers of people are being attracted to this crazy ideology			0
’ mr @entity125 said the @entity26 ’s @entity99 community was also to blame for the failure to tackle radicalisation			1
he said it was in denial and prone to ‘ ridiculous conspiracy theories ’			0
professor @entity152 , of the @entity153 at the @entity154 , said : ‘ why are there @entity113 there ? in my view this is because @entity160 extremist ideologies have been able to be spread with relative ease in our country under the cover of religion , free speech and multiculturalism			1
’ three men who produced a propaganda video for @entity110 from @entity17 spoke in @entity42 accents ' @entity172 ' @entity171 and @entity173 , both 16 , who have 28 gcses between them , fled @entity175 for @entity18 , have married warlords and hope to train as doctors to treat @entity110 fighters former security minister @entity179 said : ‘ there ’s a huge task to be done of staunching the flow of people ( to @entity18 )			1
' there are various things that the government can do , particularly in cooperation with the @entity189 government , to disrupt the flow of people and prevent them actually getting over the border , and that has now become an extremely urgent task			0
’ during the 1990s , the threat of @entity99 extremism was not taken seriously as security chiefs focused resources on foiling attacks by terror groups in @entity201			0
hate preachers such as hook - handed fanatic @entity203 were allowed to come to @entity26 and spout anti-western bile			2
in the wake of the july 7 , 2005 bombings in @entity31 , in which 52 innocent people were murdered , @entity206 launched the ‘ @entity212 ’ strategy , a £ 200million - plus scheme intended to stop young @entity15 from becoming radicalised			2
@entity213 ( left ) , 23 , died last year in a battlefield clash 2,000 miles from his @entity216 home last december after bragging how life in @entity18 was ' 5 - star ' jihad			0
@entity220 , 20 , ( right ) is fighting in @entity18 @entity221 was a father - of - three from @entity222 who became the first @entity113 to blow himself up @entity223 has suggested ‘ major powers ’ including the @entity26 and @entity38 are to blame for the rise of @entity40 militants			1
the @entity228 president hinted that a @entity230 vote last year , when mps rejected @entity4 ’s motion of using force in @entity18 if necessary , was partly behind the rise of the terror group in @entity18 and @entity17			1
he said in an interview with @entity228 newspaper @entity237 on wednesday : ‘ if , two years ago , we had acted to ensure a transition , we would n’t have had @entity40			0
‘ if , one year ago , the major powers had reacted to the use of chemical weapons , we would n’t have had this terrible choice between a dictator and a terrorist group			2
’ mr @entity223 said @entity228 delivered weapons to rebels battling president @entity249 ’s regime ‘ a few months ago ’			0
he added that @entity228 ‘ should not stop the support that we have given to these rebels ’ , but that the country ‘ could not go it alone ’			0
in august last year , the prime minister was humiliated when @entity253 and @entity255 rebels defeated the motion , ruling out military action against @entity249			0
but by 2009 the @entity53 government was forced to admit it had been a disastrous failure , with money actually bankrolling extremism			0
councils and police – in charge of handing over public funds to supposedly moderate @entity99 groups – had made ‘ serious mistakes ’ , said a hard - hitting think - tank report			0
a government source said : ‘ discussions are continuing across @entity48 on the implementation of the taskforce findings			1
it is not true to say we are doing nothing			0
we are working to tackle extremism in a number of areas , including schools , colleges and prisons			0
’ a @entity285 spokesman said : ‘ extremism of any kind has absolutely no place in our society			0
we have a wide range of powers at our disposal to disrupt travel and manage the risk posed by returnees , including prosecuting those who break the law			0

@entity4 created ' extremist taskforce ' in wake of @entity6 killing
but none of the group *'s* recommendations have been implemented
critics say @entity48 failing to control fanatics ' hijacking ' young @entity113
officials claim there are ' far more ' than 500 @entity26 youths fighting for @entity110
