if you ’re bored of crosswords and sick of @entity3 , an enigmatic new riddle game may be just the mental challenge you need			2
a mysterious app called none * gives users only one clue to get started and a keyboard to type their guesses			1
there are no images , music , animations , sound effects or hints to help users , or indication of what the purpose of the game is exactly			1
examples of ' questions ' are pictured above left and right available for @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity31 devices , the description of the game in stores reads : ‘ no one really knows what none * game is about			2
’ the free app has a pitch black screen and a single clue written in white text , as well as showing a small keyboard			1
upon starting the game , there is no indication what the goal of it is , how many levels there are , or even how users are supposed to solve some of the more obscure riddles			2
however , the app can be completed and has 50 levels , according to people bragging on the @entity58 that they have completed the none * app. the questions are relatively simple to start with , including basic maths questions and others that have clear answers , but then extend to name associations , before seemingly showing random statements and even coordinates			1
available for @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity31 devices , the description of the game in stores reads : ‘ no one really knows what none * game is about			2
’ it is intentionally more mysterious than a crossword ( stock image ) and does not have as descriptive clues or aids of hints or images to help players guess the answers the app is available to download for @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity31 devices			1

clues include : ' the ultimate question of life , the universe and everything , ' ' p + left step 1 + left step 7 + right step 1 + right step 1 ' and ' the answer is next			0
the next is answer '			0
then there is a blank space beneath the clue to write the answer			0
@entity121 - based @entity99 , who created none * , told @entity123 that it ’s his first text - based puzzle game for mobile			1
he said that there are 50 levels in none * but just 10 per cent of players have completed the game			1

‘ some of the clues had me thinking for days			0

exasperated player @entity168 wrote : ‘ frustratingly vague " puzzle " game			0
none * refers to itself as a puzzle game , but that 's a poor descriptor			2

’ around 10 per cent of none * players have completed the app 's 50 levels and are eagerly anticipating their second episode , but others were simply frustrated with it ( stock image )			1

about 10 *%* of players so far have completed the app 's 50 levels
