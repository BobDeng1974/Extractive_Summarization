in an episode of animated series @entity2 , @entity0 unveiled a contraption known as the ‘ @entity5 ’ , which let users ‘ smell ’ distant stars and planets			1
although billed as a fictional device , @entity11 scientists claim to have developed a similar system and have used it capture the ' flavours ' of @entity17 ’s @entity16			1
by replicating @entity16 ’s atmosphere in a lab , they were able to work out what @entity16 's atmosphere is made from , and the technique could be used to discover the composition of other worlds as well			1
@entity11 scientists have recreated the ' scent ' of @entity17 's @entity16 ( pictured in ultraviolet and infrared ) by combining gases in a lab and letting them react			1
this helped to determine the identity of a material that had been detected in the atmosphere by the @entity35 spacecraft , which is now thought to be benzene in the experiment , researchers at @entity11 ’s @entity38 in @entity39 recreated @entity16 ’s atmosphere in a lab by mixing different gases thought to make up its hazy exterior			1
with its thick atmosphere and organic - rich chemistry , @entity16 resembles a frozen version of @entity48 , several billion years ago , before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere			2
because @entity16 is less massive than @entity48 , its gravity does n’t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly , so the atmosphere extends 370 miles ( 600 kilometres ) into space			2
as on @entity48 , the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that come with the seasons , although the seasons on @entity16 are about seven @entity48 years long			0
@entity16 's ‘ water ’ is liquid methane , @entity64 , better known on @entity48 as natural gas			2
regular @entity48 - water , @entity68 , would be frozen solid on @entity16 where the surface temperature is @entity70 ( -290 ° f )			0
with @entity16 's low gravity and dense atmosphere , methane raindrops could grow twice as large as @entity48 's raindrops			2
as well as this , they would fall more slowly , drifting down like snowflakes			0
scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades			0
two of these , namely nitrogen and methane , were previously known , but the third component that had been detected was a mystery			0
through a method of trial - and - error , they eventually found their best attempts at mimicking the atmosphere occurred when their third gas was benzene - most commonly found in gasoline			1
the process was not entirely dissimilar to how a chef tastes a dish and works out what ingredients were used in the recipe			0
by trying different gases , the researchers were able to create an artificial atmosphere that matched the signature of @entity16 ’s real atmosphere			0
benzene is what is known as an aromatic hydrocarbon , and it 's a sweet - smelling compound			1
however , the researchers warned that because of @entity16 ’s immense surface pressure , people would have a hard time smelling it on the surface			0
' now we can say that this material has a strong aromatic character , which helps us understand more about the complex mixture of molecules that makes up @entity16 ’s haze , ' said @entity116 , a planetary scientist at @entity11 ’s @entity38 in @entity117 , @entity39			1
in the research scientists aimed to create an ' atmosphere ' that mimicked the signature of @entity16 's as shown in this graph			1
to do so scientists had to experiment with different gases until benzene was found to give the same signature			0
the process was similar to how a chef works out the ingredients in food by tasting it in the animated television series @entity2 , @entity0 creates a comical ' @entity5 ' ( pictured ) that lets him and his crew ' smell ' the composition of distant stars and worlds , used in one scene to spot a rip in space - time			1
@entity11 's lab experiment , while less impressive - looking , surprisingly used a similar principle previous attempts to recreate @entity16 ’s atmosphere in a laboratory have seen limited success , as aside from nitrogen and methane it was not well - known what it is composed of			1
this new method of combining gases and letting them react gives astronomers a better understanding of this @entity48 - like world , so labelled because of its thick atmosphere and surface lakes and seas			0
‘ @entity16 ’s chemical makeup is veritable zoo of complex molecules , ’ added @entity156 , @entity157 at @entity11 ’s @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity160			2
‘ with the combination of laboratory experiments and @entity35 data , we gain an understanding of just how complex and wondrous this @entity48 - like moon really is			0
’ it is feasible this same method could be used to work out the composition of atmospheres on other worlds - including , most intriguingly , those of potentially - habitable planets outside the solar system			1
this would help astronomers work out if a particular exoplanet contains the right atmospheric ingredients for life to exist			0
@entity11 's @entity35 ( illustration shown ) has been orbiting @entity17 and its moons since 1 july 2004			2
the probe has been a huge success , revealing untold secrets of the @entity17 system including liquid oceans on @entity16 's surface , huge storms on @entity17 and geysers on the icy moon @entity192 most of what we know to date about @entity16 comes from @entity11 ’s @entity35 spacecraft , which has been orbiting the @entity17 system since 1 july 2004			1
however , while @entity35 has imaged the surface and studied the atmosphere of @entity16 , it had been unable to identify a material in the moon ’s smoggy haze			1
now thanks to this research astronomers have a better understanding on what this world is made of			0
the mystery material was first detected by @entity35 ’s @entity210 , an instrument that makes observations in the infrared			2
‘ this is the closest anyone has come , to our knowledge , to recreating with lab experiments this particular feature seen in the @entity35 data , ’ said lead author of the study @entity216 .			0

@entity11 scientists in @entity39 recreated the atmosphere of @entity17 's @entity16
this helped them identify a mystery material detected on the moon
results *suggest* it is benzene - an aromatic compound found in gasoline
the method has helped them discover what the atmosphere is made of
and it could be used for other worlds inside , or beyond , our solar system
device is similar to the fictional ' @entity5 ' from tv show @entity2
