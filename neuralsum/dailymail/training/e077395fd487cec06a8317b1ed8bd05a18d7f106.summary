@entity0 faces a wider - reaching probe into its finances amid suspicions a black hole in its accounts is far bigger than originally stated			1
@entity7 ’s biggest supermarket is already under investigation by the @entity9 over claims it inflated profits by £ 263million in the first six months of this financial year			1
but now the @entity14 , the professional body for accountants , wants to formally investigate accounts filed in 2012 , 2013 and 2014			1
the investigation is extremely serious , for companies have a legal duty to give accurate information to shareholders and the @entity32 so they can decide whether to invest their savings and pensions in them			1
the inquiry will not only look at @entity0 ’s accounts but also the role of the firm ’s auditors , @entity39 , who signed off the figures as a true and accurate account record			1
the accounting scandal was revealed by @entity0 ’s new chief executive , @entity43 , who was parachuted in to the business in september to help turn around a fall in sales and profits			2
one of his first jobs was to order the suspension of a number of firm ’s most senior executives , some of whom have since left the business			2
the problem is understood to relate to a series of complex payments between @entity0 and its suppliers			2
it involved a tactic of first agreeing a price with suppliers , but then demanding rebate payments from these same firms to stock their products and ensure they were displayed on prominent shelves			0
the timing of these payments may have been manipulated to make the firm ’s financial performance appear stronger than it was			1
mr @entity43 has now scrapped this regime in favour of a more transparent system			0
@entity0 recently issued a new profit warning suggesting the figure for the current financial year will be down by around 60 per cent on 2013 to no more than £ 1.4billion			2
@entity0 first announced in september that it had discovered an accounting problem relating to expected results for the first half of the current financial year			1
a subsequent probe by @entity82 into the affair , which involved rebates from suppliers being moved to different periods on the company 's balance sheet , found it had been going on at least as far back as the 2012/13 period			1
the @entity14 has already said it was ' giving careful consideration ' as to whether it should take regulatory action			1
today the body said it had launched a probe ' in relation to the preparation , approval and audit ' of @entity0 's financial statements in the financial years ending in 2012 , 2013 and 2014			1
it will also cover ' conduct in relation to the matters reported in the company 's interim results ' for the first half of the current financial year - when the @entity82 probe was published			1
it is the latest in a series of probes that have rocked the supermarket chain and seen executives suspended the investigation will cover members of professional accountancy bodies , from either @entity0 or its auditors , who were involved with the accounts , as well as the member firm , @entity39 , which was and remains @entity0 's auditor			1
@entity39 said in a statement : ' we take our responsibilities very seriously and remain committed to delivering work to the highest professional standards			0
we will cooperate fully with the @entity14 in its inquiries			1
' @entity39 said it would have been responsible for the external audit element of the statements			1
the preparation and approval were done by @entity0			1
the latest investigation opens up @entity0 's books to scrutiny going back a year further than the previous investigation by @entity82			1
results of that probe published alongside half - year figures this year showed a £ 118 million hit for the latest period , plus £ 70 million for 2013/14 and £ 75 million for 2012/13			2
but the @entity14 investigation goes back to the year ended 2012			1
the @entity14 has powers to issue unlimited fines to individuals or firms or to suspend them from professional accounting bodies			1
a @entity0 spokesman said : ' we note the @entity14 is launching an investigation into individuals and a member firm in relation to the preparation , approval and audit of our accounts for the last three years			1
we will provide support to the @entity14 's investigation			1
' @entity7 managing director @entity160 ( left ) was among those suspended in the wake of the scandal			0
@entity43 ( right ) has taken temporary charge of the supermarket 's @entity7 operations it is the latest challenge facing the supermarket coming a couple of weeks after it issued a £ 500 million profits warning - its fourth this year			1
@entity0 said earnings would be hit by investments in price and availability of its products as well as a shake - up of the way it handles its supply chain in the wake of the accounting scandal			2
@entity183 analyst @entity182 said profits warning implied its @entity7 profits for the second half would be virtually wiped out			0
chief executive @entity43 , appointed in september , has temporarily taken charge of the supermarket 's @entity7 operations during its key @entity190 trading period			1
sales have been squeezed amid a price war spurred by the threat of discounters @entity194 and @entity195			0
eight executives including @entity7 managing director @entity160 were suspended in the wake of the accounting scandal			2
mr @entity160 and three others have now left , one has returned to his job and three remain suspended			0
mr @entity43 has said the suspensions do not indicate guilt			0
