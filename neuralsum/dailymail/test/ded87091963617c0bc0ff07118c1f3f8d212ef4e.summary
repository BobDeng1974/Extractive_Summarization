@entity1 manager @entity0 has vowed to give pal @entity2 the red - button treatment if he tries calling him ahead of tuesday 's crunch six - pointer			1
@entity5 will leapfrog @entity0 's side and plunge them back into the drop zone if they win at @entity9 in what represents a pivotal game for both sides			1
@entity2 , who was @entity13 's closest lieutenant at @entity14 last season , had at the weekend vowed to take the unusual step of trying to make contact with his opposing manager ahead of the game			1
@entity0 takes on his friend @entity2 when @entity1 play @entity5 @entity2 ( right ) was @entity0 's ally when the the @entity1 man was at the helm of @entity14 last season @entity0 's @entity1 team were swept aside by @entity24 on saturday , losing 3 - 0 at @entity25 yet @entity0 insists he will allow nothing to distract him from his primary focus of keeping @entity1 in the division			1
he said : ' i have n't spoke to @entity2 for a while			2
i keep red buttoning him ! have i text him to say well done ( over the @entity5 result ) ? no. ' it 's not changed			1
i hope he does well			0
i respect @entity2 as a coach and a manager ' for someone to put is head on the block like he has , good luck to him , not tomorrow though			2
' i hope we both survive			0
it 's more likely we will than them because after tuesday night we could be six points ahead			1
' it 's hard , what do you talk about ? you ca n't share team notes			2
only ' how 's the family , are you alright ? ok , see you tuesday			2
' ' he 's a good pal of mine and very loyal friend but it 's been put to one side			2
' @entity0 has guided @entity1 to an @entity56 semi-final , with @entity57 or @entity58 lying in wait on sunday week			1
yet he insists he will take no pleasure from their day out at @entity62 if their they fail to get any more points on the board from their @entity5 showdown and saturday 's eagerly - anticipated return for the boss to @entity70			1
@entity1 captain @entity71 looks dejected as @entity1 are beaten by @entity24 in the @entity72 @entity2 led @entity5 to a 4 - 1 victory at @entity74 at @entity75 on saturday @entity76 scored a stunning goal in @entity5 's big win but @entity0 claims he saw ' chinks in the armoury ' he continued : ' i 'm not even considering @entity62 , it 's not an option			1
' it wo n't be a good day out if we do n't pick up any points before now and the semi final			0
it 's all about tuesday			2
this is huge for us			0
' @entity0 insists @entity1 , whose mini-revival has been halted by back - to - back defeats , should not fear @entity5 despite them winning 4 - 1 at @entity74 on saturday			1
he added : ' we saw they scored four goals , we know they have got threats and two goals were contenders for goal of season			0
' we saw enough chinks in the armoury for a @entity1 side to play well and exploit			1
' we ca n't rely on anyone else , we know what we need to do , we know we have to win a considerable amount of games between now and the end of the season to stay safe and , that 's what we intend to do			0
' it 's a great opportunity for us to put some breathing space points between us and @entity2 ' @entity5			1
' it 's about those players when they cross the line , it 's time for them to stand up and be counted , have they got what it takes to stay in @entity72 ? ' i believe they have , they need to believe it and we need to start showing it starting showing it from tuesday			1
' the manager has bemoaned his team 's crippling injury crisis with @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 all sidelined			0
@entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 are also doubtful , while @entity135 and @entity136 have been long - term absentees			0
' i 've never seen an injury crisis like it , ' @entity0 added			2
@entity0 admitted his concern at @entity1 's injury list as he looks to lead the club away from relegation @entity130 heads @entity1 's list of absentees , with @entity131 and @entity129 also missing for @entity5 ' i never thought i 'd be one of those managers who moans about injuries			1
you get one back and lose another two			0
' they 're not trivial injuries , they 're always two , three , four weeks			0
it is ok in september but not now			0
that 's pretty much writing off the season			0
' it 's a case of seeing who can come in			0
a few are back from injury , medically rather than physically , but it 's a need must situation			0
some of them will be risked			0
