the @entity8 @entity7 , who lost his primary this summer and subsequently resigned his congressional seat , will serve as a vice chairman and managing director of @entity15 the investment bank			1
filings with the @entity17 uncovered by @entity19 reporter @entity18 show that @entity1 stands to earn $ 3.4 million in cash and stocks by joining the investment firm - a cushy deal for the recently ousted member of @entity25			1
@entity1 was making a fraction of that - $ 174,000 a year - before he left @entity25 in mid-august			2
in this june 11 , 2014 , photo , then @entity28 majority leader @entity1 speaks at the @entity30 in @entity31 officially stepped down from his position in @entity25 last month after losing his party 's primary to a political novice backed by the @entity6 the filing shows that @entity1 negotiated a $ 400,000 signing bonus for himself and a $ 400,000 base salary			1
next year , @entity39 has agreed to give @entity1 an additional $ 1.2 million as incentive pay			0
the company will also grant @entity1 $ 400,000 in restricted stocks that will be transferred to him quarterly in 2015 and $ 1,000,000 in restricted stocks that will be released to him incrementally upon his third anniversary at the company			2
@entity1 wo n't receive the stocks , however , if the company fires him for cause or he leaves to take ' a full - time elected or appointed position in federal government , state government , or a national political party ' before the agreed upon date			1
furthermore , @entity1 will have to repay some or all of his signing bonus or incentive pay from 2015 and 2016 if he goes back into politics before the second anniversary of the payment dates , giving the former lawmaker serious motivation not to return to politics anytime soon			0
' i 've got a lot to learn , ' @entity1 told the @entity64 when it asked about a political comeback			2
' i 'm very focused on my next step			0
' @entity1 told the @entity64 that talks between himself and @entity15 founder @entity39 , whom he has know for three years , began just before the @entity68			2

his full resignation from the legislative body became official on august 18			1
@entity1 's abrupt departure from the @entity28 followed a shocking defeat in his party 's primary by a @entity6 backed political novice named @entity91			1
brat 's upset victory in the race delivered a crushing blow to the rising @entity7 's political career and stopped his ascension to @entity98 dead in its tracks			0
the former congressional leader claimed in his op - ed that he was resigning because he wanted constituents have a ' clear and strong voice ' during the ' consequential ' lame duck session at the end of the year			0
if @entity91 wins the special election , which will be held concurrently with the general election in the heavily @entity7 district , he will be able to take office immediately instead of having to wait until january			0
the timing of @entity1 's resignation raised questions about the genuine reason for his early retirement			1
suspicions that it was tied to a future employment opportunity were all but confirmed by @entity1 's own account of his hiring discussions with @entity39			1
' after @entity122 ’s upset victory in june , many analysts accused @entity1 of paying more attention to @entity4 than to the people of @entity8 ’s @entity125			0
he certainly did n’t waste any time validating that theory , ' @entity126 , national communications director for the @entity127 , said in a statement on tuesday			0

' what i want is a partner			0
' @entity1 and his family wo n't be moving to @entity158 , however , the @entity64 reports			0
