@entity0 today signalled that he will protect benefits for @entity3 ’s wealthiest pensioners			1
the prime minister insisted there were not big savings to be made from cutting winter fuel payments , tv licences and bus passes for the well - off			1
it raises the prospect of the @entity13 being the only major party going into the election vowing to preserve the payments for all over- 65s , while cutting welfare for people of working age			2
prime minister @entity0 , pictured today , gave his clearest signal yet that he will repeat his 2010 pledge to protect pensioner benefits , saying it was a matter of ' fairness ' to ensure handouts continue for over- 65s mr @entity0 promised before the 2010 election that voters could ‘ read my lips ’ as he vowed all pensioner benefits would continue			1
@entity32 deputy pm @entity31 has branded the pledge ‘ completely irrational ’ and said he would be ‘ gobsmacked ’ if mr @entity0 repeated the promise in the @entity36 manifesto in 2015			1
senior conservatives including work and pensions secretary @entity38 had been urging the prime minister to ditch the pledge for the next election			1
but mr @entity0 today suggested that he would repeat the promise for the next five years , in a direct pitch to older people who are more likely to vote			2
he told @entity44 ’s today programme : ‘ i made a very clear at the last election that we would keep pensioner benefits and we have kept that promise , we have kept those benefits			1
‘ we ’ll set out our plans for that specific area closer to the election			0
i ’ve always said that there are n’t huge savings to be made from axing these benefits and i think pensioners welcome the clarity that there has been			1
’ @entity32 leader @entity31 and @entity60 's @entity59 have both promise to reduce benefits for well - off pensioners if they get into power after the election on may 7 @entity65 what is it ? by law those over 62 get a free bus pass for off - peak travel , although the age will rise to 66 by 2020			1
local authorities can extend it to others if they want to			0
the over- 60s get one in @entity77			2
@entity78 what is it ? those born on or before july 5 , 1952 , are entitled to £ 200 when the cold weather sets in			2
those over 80 receive £ 300			0
most payments were made in november and december			0
free tv licence what is it ? the over- 75s are entitled to a free television licence worth £ 145.50 for a colour set and £ 49.00 for a black and white tv			1
how can you hand it back ? unclear			0
pensioners initially have to apply for the free licence online or at a post office			2
but once it has been set up the authorities keep handing out a free licence every three years to all recipients with a national insurance number			0
he said protecting extra benefits for pensioners was key to ensuring fairness in @entity3			2
‘ this country has had to make difficult long term decisions			0
we have had to work through a plan to get our deficit down and live within out means ‘ i do n’t think it would be fair to ask pensioners to make the biggest adjustment			0
because when you are a pensioner it ’s more difficult to adjust your circumstances and that ’s why we made the commitment that the pension would always go up by earnings or prices or by 2.5 per cent , the so - called triple lock			1
‘ and as a result a pensioner today has £ 800 more through their pension than they did when i become prime minister			1
‘ i think that was the right commitment to make because dignity and security in old age should be part of the promise we make to people in our country			0
’ the @entity32 blocked any further welfare reform i the current coalition unless mr @entity0 agreed to axe the £ 2billion in benefits to the better off , including the winter fuel allowance , free bus passes and free tv licences			1
@entity60 has said it will stop winter fuel payments to 600,000 pensioners on higher and top - rate tax			1
the @entity148 has warned taxpayers will have to find another £ 12billion by the end of the decade to pay for benefits for pensioners			1
shadow chancellor @entity154 said today : ' we have said we will have some difficult decisions to get the deficit down			2
' we would reverse the top rate income tax rate cuts which the @entity13 delivered for people earning over £ 150,000 , but we ’ve also said that we would have to take the winter allowance from the richest pensioners , pensioners with pensions over £ 42,000 - a - year			1
' that is the kind of tough choice which we are making which the @entity36 are n’t making , as we saw from @entity0 today			0
' tens of thousands of families where no one works will have their benefits slashed , @entity0 is to pledge today			0
the current £ 26,000 cap would be cut to £ 23,000 within days of the @entity13 winning the general election , the prime minister will say			1
as the campaign enters its final 100 days with two polls showing his party has moved into a narrow lead , mr @entity0 is also promising tax relief for the middle classes			0
reducing the welfare cap by £ 3,000 to £ 23,000 – equivalent to a pre-tax salary of around £ 29,300 – would hit an additional 70,000 workless households and save taxpayers an extra £ 135million per year ( file picture ) he is determined to ensure welfare is no longer a ' lifestyle choice ' , while rewarding those who are in work			2
he will pledge that the @entity36 would reduce the limit on handouts to jobless families within a week of being re-elected			0
housing benefit would be removed from jobless 18 to 21 - year - olds , meaning they will have to live with their parents like millions of youngsters starting out in a job			1
the new cuts would squeeze the incomes of 100,000 jobless households and raise money to be ploughed into apprenticeships for three million school leavers			0
the @entity203 has already introduced a welfare cap of £ 26,000 per household in what polls suggest is one of its most popular policies			0
however , further welfare cuts have been hampered by @entity32 opposition			2
reducing the cap to £ 23,000 – equivalent to a pre-tax salary of around £ 29,300 – would hit an additional 70,000 workless households and save taxpayers an extra £ 135million per year , while the housing benefit squeeze on younger jobseekers would apply to 30,000 claimants and save a further £ 120million			2
only claimants of @entity221 would be exempt from the new cap			0
the prime minister and chancellor @entity224 visited @entity225 in @entity226 , @entity227 , today shadow work and pensions secretary @entity228 said : ' @entity60 supports a cap on benefits			1
we will ask an independent commission to look at whether the cap should be lower in some areas			0
' but @entity0 ca n't hide from the fact that his government has spent gbp25 billion more than planned on welfare because of his failure to tackle the low pay that leaves millions dependent on benefits to make ends meet			0
' and nobody will believe promises on apprenticeships from a government that had seen the number of apprenticeships for young people fall			0

prime minister signals he will repeat promise to protect pensioner benefits
insists there are not ' huge savings ' to be made from cutting them
@entity259 fuel allowance and free bus passes for the over- 75s would continue
@entity60 and the @entity32 have both promised to cut them for well - off
