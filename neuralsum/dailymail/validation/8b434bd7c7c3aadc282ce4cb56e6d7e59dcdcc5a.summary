a serving @entity1 police officer revealed that he broke down in tears after he read the @entity4 report which condemned his force and said : ‘ i just close my eyes and wish it was n’t like that ’			1
the officer said that his colleagues were ‘ good cops ’ and that they were ‘ hurting ’ just like the rest of the community			2
in an exclusive interview with @entity16 he said they were all standing behind embattled @entity1 police chief @entity18 but were fearful they would lose their jobs if the department was shut down			1
he said : ‘ people who do n’t know me see me and then they hate me			1
that ’s not fair ...			2
i ’m not going to hate people because they are venting			1
‘ it ’s tough but i still have to get to work			0
‘ i have to take it because they are venting and we have to let them vent , but i will protect this city , i will protect @entity1 ’			0
but a serving officer from the force said : ' we are not bad cops			1
' concern : outgoing attorney general @entity42 focused the report on relations between police and citizens @entity48 figures : the shooting of @entity50 ( left ) by officer @entity51 ( right ) in august created a firestorm over policing in @entity1 and beyond			1
totemic : the image of officer @entity51 standing beside the body of @entity50 became central to the controversy which surrounded the case the officer spoke out as the family of @entity50 said they would file a wrongful death lawsuit over their son ’s death			1
the 18 - year - old was shot dead by former @entity1 officer @entity51 last august in a killing which sparked widespread looting across the city			1
the landmark @entity4 report that was commissioned as a result painted a devastating portrait of a police force which unfairly targeted blacks for traffic stops and arrests			1
one @entity1 city employee has been fired and two are under investigation but @entity51 did not face charges			1
critics however have called for the entire @entity1 police force to be disbanded and shut down			2
as he released the report attorney general @entity42 said that the conclusions were ' searing '			1
he said that in @entity1 a ' deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and residents '			0
he said @entity1 was : ' a community where this harm frequently appears to stem , at least in part , from racial bias – both implicit and explicit			0
and a community where all of these conditions , unlawful practices , and constitutional violations have not only severely undermined the public trust , eroded police legitimacy , and made local residents less safe – but created an intensely charged atmosphere where people feel under assault and under siege by those charged to serve and protect them ' if @entity50 's family win their civil lawsuit they could get a payout or the city of @entity1 could reach a settlement before it goes to trial			1
wrong gesture : a protester makes the ' hands up , do n't shoot ' gesture which became the hallmark of the protests			2
but the official report said that @entity50 did not use the words or the gesture			1
violence : the decision of the grand jury not to indict @entity51 was followed by rioting , arson and looting however another finding of the @entity4 report was the @entity50 did not have his hands up when @entity51 shot him , a finding which @entity42 confirmed			1
' hands up , do n't shoot ' became the mantra of the protest movement after some witnesses said that they saw @entity50 with his arms raised			1
speaking to @entity16 , the @entity1 police officer said the report misrepresented not just the force , but the city			1
' the report is hard to read , but that ’s not me , ' he said			2
‘ i am good with the people , the community			2
do they write more tickets than some people ? maybe			2
but they are good officers			0
‘ this hurts , it really does			0
when you read it , you read it as a city as a whole			0
you read it like everybody is like that , but not everybody is like that			0
’ the statistics in the report are scathing : whilst @entity1 is 67 per cent black , just three of the 53 officers on their police force are non-white , or six per cent			1
unending protest : demonstrators marched on the headquarters of @entity170 police in @entity171 , close to @entity1			2
it has also been criticized over its conduct			0
suing : @entity50 's parents - @entity175 , his mother and @entity177 , his father , are set to take their son 's death to court in a wrongful death suit defended : the officer defending his colleagues - one of whom is pictured above during the protests in the aftermath of the decision not to charge @entity50 - said : ' we are good cops			1
' the 67 per cent of @entity188 in @entity1 account for 93 per cent of arrests made from 2012 - 2014			0
@entity188 - @entity191 drivers were two times as likely as whites to be searched during traffic stops but 26 per cent less likely to be found in possession of drugs			2
among the most shocking revelations from the report were racist emails sent by @entity201 officials in which they made jokes about president @entity205			2
one questioned his suitability for the job because ‘ what black man holds a steady job for four years ’			0
when asked about the emails , the officer said he was ‘ stunned ’ to read them but that he had not received any such messages himself in the past			2
another issue raised in the report was how black residents were disproportionately targeted for traffic tickets which contributes to the expected court revenue of $ 2.4 million this year			1
according to the report residents are seen ‘ less as constituents to be protected than as potential offenders and sources of revenue , ’ the officer said : ‘ there are guys who write a lot of tickets , yeah , but i do n’t think it was any different from other departments			1

the officer said that in the wake of the report the mood on the street had been hostile			1
he said : ‘ when we get to some of these calls people are yelling profanities ... they are filming us and that did n’t happen before			2
he added : ‘ the biggest thing that hurts is how the community feels , what are they feeling			0
that ’s very important to me			0
‘ sometimes i just sit there and cry			0
‘ we need to open a dialogue with people			0
‘ officers need to go on diversity courses			0
