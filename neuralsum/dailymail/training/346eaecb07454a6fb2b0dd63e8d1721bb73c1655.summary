by @entity0 not many people would have the courage to return to the scene where they almost lost their life			0
but @entity6 big - wave surfer @entity5 could not pass up the chance to take on the 7m - high tubes formed by a middle - of - the - ocean break dubbed @entity10 , off the coast of @entity12			1
and despite some failed attempts during the eight - hour long session , he walked away being able to say he conquered the wave			0
in a new video , @entity26 and a few other daredevils are seen taking on the gigantic waves - at times failing - and some emerge triumphant like the @entity33 surfer			1
speaking about this adventure , @entity5 told @entity35 that during the near - death experience , he was ' tossed around like a rag doll ' and was held under , while white - water pounded him			2
deeply affected by the 2012 incident , @entity5 did n't return to the spot until recently			0
footage has just surfaced showing the fearlessness of the big - wave surfers against the massive break			1
he said @entity10 was ' pound for pound ' the heaviest wave in the world and instead of breaking left like the fearsome @entity21 it , like its name suggests it breaks to the right			1
' it probably only gets really good once or twice a year			0
it ’s a spot where you need all the elements to come together , ' he told @entity35			0
' my main goal was to try and make as many waves as possible to get my confidence back up			0
in recently released footage , some of the surfers are seen taking on the wave and at times failing the two - minute film shows the sheer power and massive breaks that can be experienced off the coast of @entity12 in @entity67 ' i pretty much made every one i took off on although i did see some crazy wipeouts , including one of the skis			1
' @entity5 said he witnessed one of the locals burst his ear drum and hurt his ribs while surfing the wave			2
