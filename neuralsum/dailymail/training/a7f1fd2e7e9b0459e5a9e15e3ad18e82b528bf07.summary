@entity1 's ' tacky ' festive wonderland which received a barrage of complaints on its first day has re-opened again after a three - day hiatus - but parents remain unconvinced by the ' improvements '			1
the @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , was billed as ' the most amazing @entity10 experience that planet earth has ever seen '			1
but it had to be shut down after a catastrophic flop on its opening day , which saw hour - long queues and children - whose parents had forked out Â£ 22.50 to be there - leaving the site in tears			1
as the curtain was lifted at the site for its second grand opening , hastily - erected partition walls had still not been painted , while over-loaded electrical sockets were also visible in the main entrance			1
and a pile of tatty - looking presents lay clumsily dumped in the corner of a marquee with a red @entity27 's outfit left on top			1
@entity60 , a mother - of - two from @entity61 , described the attraction as ' more tragic than magic '			1
she said : ' it was boring			0
we whizzed round it in half - an - hour			2
the first room was especially dull			0
my kids do n't want to read sheets of text			0
' i am very disappointed			0
i really felt sorry for them after reading about saturday 's disastrous opening and thought they 'd pull all the stops out but it is , frankly , c * * p. ' media representatives were banned from attending the second opening day after the high amount of criticism sad - looking reindeers were dotted around the site as dozens flocked to give the attraction a second chance but little effort had been made to hide the incomplete construction of the few tatty stalls inside , built from temporary walls , made of wooden planks , sheet wood and facing luckily , the train - which was not working on the opening day - was in full operation at the event today the furore broke out after a barrage of complaints on the first day over elves smoking , rubbish being strewn across the paths and wooden pallets covered in plastic tarpaulin left lying around			1
the criticism meant the flamboyant tv designer was forced to haul in staff - including an actor playing @entity27 - for extra training at @entity110			2
organisers also spent three days getting the attraction in shape while others tried to manage the pr blunder , which even mr @entity1 dubbed ' @entity116 '			1
today , organisers attempted to keep criticism at bay by banning journalists from entering the site			1
while there were no long queues as there were on saturday , families were greeted in the car park by workmen who directed them to the entrance			2
after trudging to the main marquee past fake snow which had dissolved into mud during the previous night 's downpour , visitors watched as staff scrambled to open on time			1
staff at the attraction have apparently been retrained since the flop on saturday yet visitors were forced to watch the attraction 's elves putting on their make - up in the public toilets as panicking staff scrambled to get open parents and children were left waiting outside after it opened 20 minutes late which staff said was because of a road accident on the @entity150 leaving managers stranded in traffic jams wreaths of holly had been carelessly hung over doors partially blocking fire exit signs and parents and children were left waiting outside after it opened 20 minutes late which staff said was because of a road accident on the @entity150 leaving managers stranded in traffic jams			1

@entity179 @entity178 , 78 , of @entity180 , took his three - year - old granddaughter @entity181 to the attraction			2
the main ride was closed no saturday as organisers said they needed to make improvements to the experience although there are still complaints , some say there has been some improvement since saturday ( pictured ) he said : ' some of the stalls in the welcome area were n't complete			1
they had just thrown them together			0
i could have done better			0
the snow was melting into mud and was only covering part of the grass so a huge piece was just left mud			2
' i saw an actor putting his make - up in the toilets for customers			2
it was n't entertaining , it was boring			0
it is such a shame			0
' other parents even complained about health and safety issues			2
father - of - two @entity216 , 36 , said : ' there were workman stood outside by the car park			2
' i saw a grounds buggy being carted away by the entrance when i got here			0
the footpath up was muddy and very even			0
' it just did n't seem finished at all			0
' it just went from bad to worse			0
there was n't a lot to see or do			0
there was nothing exciting or magical about it sadly			0

the @entity6 opened in @entity7 in @entity8 on saturday
it *promised* to be ' the most amazing experience ever seen ' for children
but it closed after one day following thousands of complaints by parents
organisers today reopened the site after three days of hasty improvements
but parents remained unconvinced with one calling the site ' shoddy '
there were hastily - erected partition walls and visible electrical sockets
piles of tatty - looking gifts lay clumsily dumped in the corner of a marquee
visitors were also left waiting outside after venue opened 20 minutes late
journalists were banned from the site after the so - called ' @entity116 ' *episode*
