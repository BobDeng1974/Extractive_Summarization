@entity39 , the @entity40 mp for @entity41 who sits on the influential @entity43 , said : ‘ i think there is a danger that these sorts of facilities will be seen as an encouragement to migrants , whereas the @entity17 should be doing everything to disincentivise or discourage migrants from coming to @entity4 and creating problems for the @entity7 and for the town itself			1

@entity183 , deputy mayor of @entity4 , said : ‘ we get blamed for doing something , and we get blamed for doing nothing			0
