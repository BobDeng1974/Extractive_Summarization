by @entity0 cllr @entity1 , left , has been falsely claiming to have an mbe for 19 years a former policeman who has been falsely claiming to have an mbe for nearly two decades says he has been the victim of a long - running hoax			1
@entity1 , 67 , now a @entity6 councillor for @entity7 , @entity8 , even had the prestigious honour listed on the council 's website			1
the former @entity13 special constable has also admitted to lying on his @entity15 profile , wrongly claiming to be studying for a degree with the @entity17			1
he told the @entity18 that this was part of a ' game ' aimed at embarrassing an unnamed person			2
however , according to fellow @entity7 councilor @entity22 - who is now calling for his resignation - @entity24 has mentioned his degree is official statements during council meetings			1
@entity28 described it as a ' very funny sort of game '			2
mr @entity1 , who lived in @entity32 with his wife @entity33 , had claimed he was awarded the @entity34 19 years ago while working for the police but had not attended the ceremony			1
he said the medal was subsequently sent in the post and that he hid it in a draw because it ' embarrassed ' him			0
once the truth was uncovered , mr @entity1 declared he had been the victim of a hoax by a resentful ex-colleague who had ' set out to deceive ' him			1
he said : ' i was shocked to discover that i have been the victim of an elaborate and malicious hoax over the awarding of the mbe			1
' i was informed that i had been awarded an mbe in 1995 while working in the @entity13			1
the former special constable claims to have been the victim of a prank by ex-colleagues ' at the time i had no reason to question the validity of the correspondence and , as my late wife and i decided not to attend the investiture at @entity58 , was subsequently sent a medal in the post			1
' at the time i was embarrassed at receiving the honour and put the medal in a drawer along with my long service medal			0
' it was not until recently that my present wife suggested that i should acknowledge the honour			0
' i spent most of yesterday contacting former colleagues only to discover that my worst fears were true and that an aggrieved ex-colleague had set out to deceive me			2
' i do n’t know why i did not question the official correspondence that i received at the time : probably because i was overcome with feelings of pride and kudos			0
' i asked my ex-colleagues why i was n’t told the truth either at the time or afterwards and it seems that people and time moving on meant that it was lost in the ether			0
' the @entity13 declined to comment on the specific case , but a spokeswoman said : ' we expect all of our officers to behave with a certain level of professionalism at all times			2
' even his profile on the council 's webpage listed the prestigious honour after his name other local organisatins , including the @entity98 , believed @entity24 , left , when he said he had the award mr @entity1 was elected to @entity100 in 2009 but is now facing calls to step down			1
however , he has said he has no intention of doing so			0
the local @entity103 will be conducting an investigation into the incident			0
councillor @entity22 , who is a member of the @entity107 party , said : ' mr @entity1 should seriously consider his position			1
i am considering reporting both himself and the @entity6 to the appropriate authority , as i believe this to be electoral fraud			2
' he added : ' all that i can say is that i 've never wanted to call anyone a liar until it is proven they are but if his story is proven true then he is either extremely unfortunate or extremely stupid			0
i 've just got the impression that there is more to uncover and there could be a whole house of cards about to fall down			0
' @entity24 said : ' the fact that this hoax has gone on for 19 years has come as a huge shock to both me and my wife			2
' i have not used the honour for personal gain			0
i would like to apologise unreservedly to anyone whom i may have unwittingly misled in the past			0
' i shall be removing all mention of the award on stationery and e-mail addresses immediately			0
