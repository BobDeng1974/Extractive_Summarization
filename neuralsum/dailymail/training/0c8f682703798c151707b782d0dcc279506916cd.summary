by @entity0 @entity1 has warned the @entity2 that it faces ‘ final destruction ’ – during a @entity4 conference on disarmament			1
the open threat came amid growing tensions on the peninsula following the @entity1 ’s recent nuclear testing			2
since last week ’s test , which was carried out in defiance of @entity4 resolutions , its southern neighbour warned it could strike if it felt an attack was imminent			1
' no fear ' : @entity1 officials watched soldiers at a rally organised to celebrate the state 's successful nuclear test last week in response , @entity1 diplomat @entity24 told the @entity4 meeting : ‘ as the saying goes , a new - born puppy knows no fear of a tiger			1
@entity32 ’s erratic behaviour would only herald its final destruction			0
’ his comments drew quick criticism from other nations , including @entity32 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , whose ambassador @entity40 said such language was ‘ completely inappropriate ’			2
‘ it can not be allowed that we have expressions which refer to the possible destruction of @entity4 member states , ’ she said			1
@entity49 has said the aim of the nuclear test was to bolster its defences in the wake the hostility of the @entity55 , which is pushing for sanctions on @entity1			1
but the @entity57 exercised ‘ its maximum self - restraint ’ , said mr @entity24 , who added that hostility from the @entity55 would leave his country ‘ with no option but to take the second and third stronger steps in succession ’			0
he did not specify what that would entail			0
@entity1 has already told @entity66 it is prepared to stage one or two more tests this year to force the @entity55 into talks			0
@entity71 ambassador @entity70 said the comments had left him stupefied and appeared to be a breach of international law			0
warning : soldiers in @entity32 - which said in the wake of its northern neighbour 's nuclear test that it could strike if it believed an attack was imminent - participate in a live fire drill ' in the 30 years of my career i 've never heard anything like it and it seems to me that we are not speaking about something that is even admissible , we are speaking about a threat of the use of force that is prohibited by @entity93 2.4 of the @entity4 charter , ' he said			1
since the @entity57 tested a nuclear bomb last week in defiance of @entity4 resolutions , its southern neighbour has warned it could strike the isolated state if it believed an attack was imminent			1
@entity49 said the aim of the test was to bolster its defences given the hostility of the @entity55 , which has led a push to impose sanctions on @entity1			2
' @entity32 's erratic behaviour would only herald its final destruction ' @entity1 diplomat @entity24 ' our current nuclear test is the primary countermeasure taken by the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) in which it exercised its maximum self - restraint , ' said the @entity1 diplomat @entity24			1
' if the @entity55 takes a hostile approach toward the @entity1 to the last , rendering the situation complicated , it ( @entity1 ) will be left with no option but to take the second and third stronger steps in succession , ' he said , without elaborating on what that might entail			0
@entity1 has already told key ally @entity66 that it is prepared to stage one or two more tests this year to force the @entity55 into diplomatic talks , a source with direct knowledge of the message said last week			2
@entity55 ambassador @entity131 said she found @entity1 's threat today profoundly disturbing and later tweeted that it was ' offensive '			2
training : @entity32 soldiers fire live rounds during a training exercise in @entity137 , @entity32 @entity139 's representative suggested @entity1 's participation in the @entity4 forum should be limited			1
impoverished and malnourished @entity1 is one of the most heavily sanctioned states in the world			0
it is still technically at war with @entity32 after a 1950 - 53 civil war ended in a mere truce			0
@entity149 and its allies are believed to be pushing to tighten the noose around @entity1 's financial transactions in a bid to starve its leadership of funding			0
@entity24 said last week 's test was an act of self - defence against nuclear blackmail by the @entity55 , which wanted to block @entity1 's economic development and its fundamental rights			1
not happy : @entity55 ambassador @entity131 said she found @entity1 's threat today profoundly disturbing and later tweeted that it was ' offensive ' ' it is the disposition and firm will of the army and people of the @entity1 to counter high - handed policy with tough - fist policy and to react to pressure and sanctions with an all - out counter-action , ' he said			0
@entity24 said the @entity55 had conducted most of the nuclear tests and satellite launches in history , and he described its pursuit of @entity180 resolutions against @entity1 as ' a breach of international law and the height of double standards '			2
neither @entity185 nor @entity66 , which are veto - wielding members of the @entity180 , spoke at the meeting in @entity188 today			0
before its nuclear test , @entity1 was already facing growing diplomatic pressure at the @entity4			1
