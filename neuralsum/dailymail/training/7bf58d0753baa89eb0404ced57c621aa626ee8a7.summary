goalkeeper : @entity24 ' even before i met him for the first time he was a great goalkeeper , he was my inspiration ' @entity0 picked @entity9 legends @entity30 and @entity31 as the best full backs he ever played with @entity0 said facing a @entity31 free kick , even in training , was a terrifying experience right - back : @entity37 ' he was fantastic , always up and down			1
that gave the team so much energy			1
' centre - back : @entity20 ' he 's just amazing			1
he could n't train during the week , he 'd come once a week for 25 minutes , 30 maximum			1
and he was ok for the game			1
i ca n't remember him making a foul			1
he tackled only the ball			1
' centre - back : @entity47 ' a real leader , he was very quiet guy outside the pitch , in the dressing room , but when he came on the pitch he was so important for any team			2

those free kicks were so powerful			2
it was difficult to train with him , and train against him			2
when he came to hit the ball against you , it was scary			2
fortunately i played on his side			2
' defensive midfield : @entity15 ' he was a real beast in front of the defence			1
i believe for the defenders , and also for the goalkeeper , he made it an easy job for us			1
' @entity78 midfield : @entity79 ' he was , at my time at @entity80 , so important for me			2

he was a great player			0
' @entity78 midfield : @entity19 ' he was a masterclass			0
you know he can pass long balls and short balls , you can give him the ball forever			0
if you do n't know who to pass to , pass to @entity19 , he will give you the answer			0
' left wing : @entity18 ' no - one can beat him in that position			0
he was so important for us			0
he is the kind of player who can decide games , as he did at @entity99			0
we were one player down , and he almost gave us a point in that game			0
' right wing : @entity103 ' i could pick @entity30 , or @entity105 , but i pick @entity103			0
his free kicks were just amazing			0
over the wall , or under the wall - he used to do it in training sessions			0
they could keep the ball in the air for such a long time , doing tricks			0
it was just amazing to see			0
' striker : ronaldo ' outside the pitch he was just a simple guy			0
@entity117 is just a goal machine			1
he can finish left or right , does n't matter			0
in a short space he was so fast			0
' @entity18 scored a hat - trick to help @entity1 come back from 4 - 0 down against @entity99 to almost get a point @entity0 picked @entity103 ( right ) over @entity105 ( left ) , although he played with both @entity9 forwards @entity79 ( right ) was with @entity0 at @entity80 , @entity124 winner @entity103 was an international team - mate			1
