by @entity0 follow @ @ kie1410 @entity1 thinks @entity2 can break into the @entity4 first team , but the @entity6 manager admits the forward may find it tricky competing against the likes of @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 for a place			1
@entity2 , a regular in the @entity6 team , thrust himself on to the radar of @entity4 coach @entity17 after helping @entity1 's side finish fifth , leading him to recall the 20 - year - old to the @entity20			1
but @entity1 feels another year in the @entity21 would have benefited @entity22 more , rather than returning to the @entity24 giants , where he will be constantly competing for a place			2
nevertheless , it is a challenge @entity1 feels @entity2 is up to			0
' he is ready to play for @entity4 because he has special talent , certain qualities that make him stand out , ' @entity1 said in an interview with @entity51 national daily sport newspaper @entity50			1
' i was delighted when @entity53 called him up for the friendly before the @entity55			0
' they had followed him for the year he was at @entity6 and were able to see that he was performing to a very high level			0
' it would have been good for @entity2 and for @entity6 if he had stayed for us for another year			0
he would have enjoyed a bigger role in the team than i think he will have at @entity4 because of the competition he will find there			2
passion : @entity2 is ready to battle with @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 for a place boss : @entity1 says @entity2 has a ' special talent ' but wished he could have kept him for another year ' it would have been fantastic to have him at @entity6 for another year , and another year in the @entity21 would have made him better prepared to make the jump up to @entity4 , but they did n't want that , and i presume that 's because @entity17 , who knows him well , knows how good he is			1
' @entity1 , unfortunately , looks to be without another of his loan stars next season , as striker @entity77 returns to parent club @entity78 after scoring 15 goals with @entity6			1
it is believed , however , the @entity82 international could follow @entity22 to @entity39 with @entity83 among those chasing the striker , should the @entity24 champions lose @entity87 to @entity78			1
' @entity77 is a bit like @entity2 , a great player but a youngster , he arrived in @entity90 without much tactical discipline , but he has improved a lot , without losing any of his physical or technical assets , ' said @entity1			2
' if he ends up going to @entity83 , knowing the work of ( @entity83 coach ) @entity96 , it will be good for @entity96 and for @entity83			0
i also think his characteristics will suit @entity96 , and vice-versa			0
' on his way ? @entity77 is thought to be on the wish - list of @entity83 , should they lose @entity87			0

@entity1 says @entity2 is ' ready to play for @entity4 because he has special talent '
@entity6 manager admits @entity22 would have had a ' bigger role ( at @entity6 ) than i think he will have at @entity4 '
@entity22 has likes of @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 as competition at @entity20
@entity1 says @entity77 ' will suit ' @entity96 's @entity83 , if @entity78 striker follows @entity2 to @entity24
