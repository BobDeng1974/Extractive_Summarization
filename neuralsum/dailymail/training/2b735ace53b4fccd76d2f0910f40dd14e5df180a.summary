same - sex couples seeking the right to marry are asking the @entity2 to settle the issue of gay marriage nationwide			1
appeals filed friday urge the justices to review last week 's lower court ruling that upheld laws aligned against gay marriage in @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			2
the first petition – called a writ of certiorari – came in response to @entity12 rulings that upheld statewide bans on recognizing out - of - state gay marriages , and also denied an out - ofstate adoption ruling issued in favor of a same - sex couple			1
the @entity2 receives about 10,000 such writs every year and only a tiny fraction are acknowledged or acted on			1
@entity26 to read the @entity27 supporters of same - sex marriage have gained legal traction in recent years and now hope a @entity2 ruling will bring about a final decision on the thorny question of whether gays and lesbians can expect to have marriages legally recognized alongside those of traditional opposite - sex couples religious groups oppose gay marriage and hold an annual march in @entity42 – this year on june 19 – to show their political clout ; they believe marriage between one man and one woman is critical for society because children deserve the love and care of both a mother and a father the @entity53 , a gay rights advocacy group , teamed with the @entity54 to file the appeal			1
the decision by the 6th @entity58 @entity57 , based in @entity59 , was the first appellate to side with states seeking to preserve gay marriage bans since the @entity2 struck down part of a federal anti-gay marriage law last year			1
last month , the justices rejected appeals from five states of rulings favoring same - sex couples , but that was before the recent ruling created a division among lower courts			0
same - sex couples can marry in 32 states , parts of @entity76 and @entity77 , and the @entity42			0
the @entity10 and @entity11 cases involve the right of sex - same couples to marry			0
the @entity12 appeal focuses on the state 's refusal to recognize out - of - state gay marriages because of its own ban , while the @entity13 case is narrowly focused on the rights of three same - sex couples			1
in asking the @entity2 to reverse the 6th circuit , the plaintiffs in @entity12 pressed the argument that states should be forced to recognize same - sex marriages performed elsewhere			1
the 6th circuit ruling " robs married same - sex spouses and their children of dignity and legal respect from cradle to grave , " @entity59 attorney @entity97 wrote			2
@entity102 , a spokesman for @entity12 attorney general @entity103 , said lawyers for the state would review the appeal			2
" the ohio attorney general 's office had previously stated that it did not anticipate opposing a @entity2 review of the same - sex marriage issue , " @entity107 said			2
equal rights : @entity112 ( left ) and @entity113 ( right ) held an application for a marriage license at the clerk 's office at the @entity118 in @entity119 , @entity76 on oct. 8 the speed with which the appeals are being filed – eight days after the ruling – indicates the court could take up and decide the issue this term , by the end of june			0
that 's if it takes the cases at all			0
the states have a month to respond			0
if they do n't seek extra time , the gay marriages cases should be before the justices for their first private conference in 2015 , on january 9			1
if the court decides then to hear the cases , there should be time to schedule arguments in late april			0
the justices would have two months to write their opinions			0

plaintiffs want to overturn @entity12 law that bans legal acceptance of out - of - state gay marriages and *de-recognizes* out - of - state gay adoption orders
@entity2 gets about 10,000 requests every year and acts on only a few
