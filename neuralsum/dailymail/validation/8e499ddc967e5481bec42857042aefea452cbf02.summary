the full extent of the impact of good schools on house prices around @entity4 is laid bare by research released today			1
a map produced by @entity8 estate agents shows the cost of homes near the best performing schools can be more than 25 % higher than in other areas			1
each dot on the map represents a school , with the darker coloured dots representing better performing schools and the size of the dot showing the ' house price premium ' around that school			2
savills say the map shows that certain areas can be classed as ' educational hotspots ' , in which a choice of good schools leads to a spike in property prices			1
the company say the best examples of these are @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity43 in @entity44 and @entity45 in @entity46			1
the map also shows how selective grammar schools , such those in @entity48 and @entity49 , drive up house prices in the surrounding area			2
@entity54 , director of residential research at @entity8 , said : ' what it shows is there are clear house price premiums around high performing state schools			0
these are not uniform , there are exceptions where people can still get access to a well - performing school , but generally , there is a premium			0
' that said , i suppose there is a bit of a chicken and an egg situation of where you have to ask whether affluent families cluster around a high performing school , or are schools high performing because of the families who live nearby			0
' a graph produced by estate agents shows that house prices are higher than the regional average in places where pupils perform well at school the report states : ' for many [ house buyers ] , rather than pinning their hope on a single school , a choice of good schools will determine whether they will look to buy			1
' in locations such as @entity39 , @entity41 , @entity43 and @entity45 that will be driven entirely by a cluster of high performing independent schools			1
' in others such as @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 these will be supplemented by one or two high performing state school alternatives			0
' in other areas , such as @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 it might be exclusively a function of the grammar school system			0
' in others , such as @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 the a network of a range of high performing schools underpins a high value family housing market			0
' the research comes after a study last year found a top state secondary adds an average of £ 21,000 to surrounding house prices - with one school in @entity49 adding nearly £ 500,000 to the price of nearby homes			2
the research shows how parents are willing to pay much more in order to live close to a good school			0

research by estate agents shows house prices in areas with good schools are up to *28* % more than local average
map of so - *called* ' education equation ' shows well - performing schools add premiums to cost of homes
