the brothers secretly joined members of @entity4 's @entity12 regiment to shore up the defences just a stone 's throw from the @entity17 's residence , @entity18			1

' they were very keen to help with the flood relief effort and thought that joining the military would be the best way			2
' a @entity83 spokesman told @entity84 : ‘ they joined the @entity12 this morning from 6am and they have been helping to build walls of sandbags			1
’ @entity3 and @entity4 later left the office of @entity89 and got into a car alongside military personnel to continue the relief effort			1

they have been in @entity8 and the area and i think it 's gone down very well			2
' they were very natural			0
to be honest , they could have walked in among people here and nobody would have recognised them looking at the way they were dressed			0
' they were particularly interested in talking to the troops			0
the support we have received from the @entity121 has been absolutely excellent and if they had n't come into @entity8 we as a parish would have been overwhelmed			2
' while the floodwaters have receded since their peak earlier this week , 2in of rain was set to fall today with more tomorrow , raising the possibility of homes and businesses facing fresh horror over the weekend			0
the pair joined the @entity12 this morning from 6am and they have been helping to build walls of sandbags a royal aide said the pair did not want their efforts publicised in advance and only decided top pitch in on wednesday night when @entity4 was asked by reporters if he was enjoying helping out , he replied : ' not really , with you guys around ' the princes helped by unloading sandbags from military trucks onto freight trains which would then take them to areas where they are most needed			1
they are no strangers to working in disaster zones and providing emergency relief - @entity3 has worked as a rescue helicopter pilot , while @entity4 has served two tours of duty in @entity155			0

' barrier : @entity3 helps another soldier construct a dam to prevent the weather from causing too much damage in the future intrepid : @entity4 joined other soldiers as they waded through waist - deep water defences : a wall of sandbags is erected in @entity8 to ward off floodwater which could rise following today 's rain getting stuck in : the princes and the @entity12 were undeterred by the onset of rain later in the day also wading in : prime minister @entity187 was also treading water today while he had a discussion with farmer @entity190 in the @entity192 area of @entity193 @entity195 boots : earlier this week , @entity196 ( left ) and deputy prime minister @entity197 ( right ) donned their wet - weather gear as they walked around communities devastated by the floods the public statement came as deputy prime minister @entity197 denied a report that the @entity17 criticised the @entity206 response to the floods in a private meeting with him in his role as president of the @entity212			1
asked on @entity213 whether it was true that the @entity17 had ' waded in ' over flooding , mr @entity197 replied : ' no. ' he declined to discuss the content of their conversations any further			2
