a pregnant mother who did n't realise she was expecting gave birth on her bathroom floor in the middle of the night - while her partner slept through it all			1
@entity6 , 22 , of @entity7 , @entity8 , woke up suffering from what she thought were period pains but collapsed to the floor and went into labour			1
she screamed in agony for more than an hour as she delivered 7lbs 11oz baby poppy by herself			2
@entity6 with her baby daughter @entity15 , 11 months , at home in @entity8 but boyfriend @entity17 did n't wake up - even though she shrieked so loudly her concerned neighbours dialled 999			1
a fleet of police cars and ambulances arrived minutes after the birth and @entity17 , also 22 , only arose from his slumber when @entity6 presented their newborn daughter			1
@entity6 said : ' he can literally sleep through anything - fire alarms , the lot			1
i have no idea how he does it			0
' i went into our bedroom after i had given birth and showed @entity17 the baby but he just went back to sleep			1
' i woke him up again and he realised what had happened and he was completely in shock			2
' @entity6 had a rare undiagnosed pregnancy and was unaware she was carrying a child - she gained very little weight and remained a size ten throughout			1
@entity6 ( left ) with a friend			2
at the time this picture was taken @entity6 was eight months pregnant but had no idea @entity15 in hospital after birth			1
@entity6 's boyfriend @entity17 sleep through the whole thing she had two retail jobs - at @entity50 and @entity52 's restaurant and @entity54 video - and would even help her pregnant neighbour carry her shopping			1
' it was a complete surprise - i did n't have a clue that i was pregnant , ' she said			0
' i was still having regular periods , i remained a size ten , and i only put on a tiny bit of weight which i put down to eating too many burgers at my new job at @entity50 's			0
' on the sunday night i started having some sharp pains , which i just assumed was me starting my period			2
' i went to the bathroom and collapsed with pain			0
i realised i was in labour and just decided to keep pushing			0
' most people have a team of people around them telling them what to do and when but i just had to keep pushing on my own			0
' @entity17 remained completely oblivious as to what was going on in the next room - despite @entity6 screaming so loudly the neighbours called the police			1
she added : ' @entity17 just slept through the whole thing but i did manage to wake the neighbours			1
i was screaming so loudly that they called 999			0
' by the time @entity17 had woken up two police cars arrived with three paramedics , so they cut the cord and took us both to hospital			2
' @entity86 was aptly named due to her arrival on @entity88 last year			0
' when @entity86 was born she was completely silent which absolutely terrified me but then she wiggled and i was just completely relieved , ' said @entity6			2
@entity15 with her mother @entity6 ( r ) who stayed a size 10 while pregnant ' even now she 's still really well behaved , she sleeps right through the night and she 's a very calm little baby			1
' new dad @entity17 said he was ' quite embarrassed ' to have slept through his daughter 's birth - but he was exhausted from working night shifts			1
he said : ' i 'm actually quite embarrassed and a little bit gutted at the fact i managed to sleep through the whole thing			0
' it 's really not unusual for me to sleep through things - i once left a pizza in the oven for more than an hour and did n't wake up to the fire alarm or the neighbours trying to get into the house			1
' i had also just finished a 12 hour night shift as a support worker so i was pretty knackered			0
' the first thing i knew about @entity6 giving birth was when she walked into the room with @entity86 in her arms and the chord still attached			1
' i thought i was dreaming so i put my head back down and went to sleep but then the penny dropped as to what had happened			1
' i was in complete shock for days - i could n't get my head around what had happened			0
' i 'd been to have my hair cut the same day and the barber there had just got his misses pregnant			0
' i was laughing a bit and telling him that i would n't be becoming a @entity124 for at least 10 years , then less than 12 hours later i had a baby			0
' his partner @entity6 said she had no idea she was pregnant and the only symptom was back ache which she put down to juggling two jobs			1
she said : ' i think on reflection i was really lucky with my pregnancy - i did n't have any of the usual symptoms and managed to get away with it quite lightly			2
' looking back the only symptom i did have was bad back pains , but i just assumed that it was because i was working two jobs - both of which involved me being on my feet all day			1
' one of my friends is pregnant now and she is really suffering with it , so i 'm definitely extremely lucky			0
' @entity6 added that she remembers very little about the labour			2
she said : ' i know i went into labour in the early hours of the morning on @entity88 but in all honesty i really could n't tell you much about it - it seemed to happen so quickly			2
' i think the labour lasted about an hour , it was definitely no more than two , it was very quick in comparison to some people			0
' i know the ambulance turned up and cut the cord at about 7.15 but other than that i have n't really got a clue about timings			0
' i was in so much pain i could n't get up to go and get my phone to check the time or call for help			0
' it 's a bit sad really that i do n't actually know what time @entity86 was born			0
