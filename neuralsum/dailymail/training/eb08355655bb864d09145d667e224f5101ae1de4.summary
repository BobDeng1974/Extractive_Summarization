by @entity0 for the @entity1 four years ago he was christened ‘ @entity8 ’ by the @entity3 crowd and that chimed just perfectly with @entity6 ’s thoughts about @entity7			1
@entity9 was the @entity11 champion and how he loved striding the fairways and showing the ropes to his fellow @entity14 , making his debut in the @entity16 and who he looked upon as a younger brother			1
that all changed at @entity20 two years later			2
my , how the younger brother had grown			2
@entity7 and @entity6 have had public issues with their relationship , but are friends now the @entity25 pair have played together at both of the last two @entity27 with some success now he was world no 1 and a major champion in his own right , and when he struck his drive on the first hole in fourballs it flew so far it came to rest 350 yards away			1
and @entity9 thought to himself : ‘ what on earth is the point of me trying to follow that ? ’ @entity43 captain @entity42 opened a can of worms when he hinted on monday that the pair would probably not play together at this 40th @entity16 at @entity47			1
he pointed to bare statistics and , if truth be told , he raised as many questions as answers , not least given the background of the strained relationship between @entity7 and @entity6 over the past couple of years			1
but then came @entity9 on tuesday to put a little flesh on the bones			2
‘ @entity58 and @entity7 , there ’s no doubt our personal issues ( @entity7 is suing his former management company , @entity62 , where @entity6 is a shareholder ) have been well documented but i believe we ’ve come out of it better friends than we were going into it , so that ’s not the issue this weekend , ’ he said			1
@entity6 said on tuesday that he was unsure whether it suited his game to play with @entity7 again @entity43 captain @entity42 has hinted that he may keep the @entity70 apart this week video pundits provide insight into pairings ‘ i ’ll be the first to admit , and @entity7 and i have spoken about this , i found it very difficult playing with him in the fourballs at @entity20			1
he likes to go first , he hits it miles and so then i ’m throwing myself at my ball			2
it really did n’t help my game playing with him in fourballs			2
‘ but foursomes is different			2
who would n’t want to be playing their second shot off a 350 - yard drive ? i think we could still play foursomes really well together			2
’ will they get the chance ? it might need proceedings to be going seriously wrong for it to happen			2
@entity42 has identified another rookie for @entity6 to shepherd over the practice sessions and that is enigmatic @entity98 @entity97			1
it is a role @entity6 would be only too happy to have from friday onwards			1
‘ perhaps i ’m the kind of guy who needs to feel like he is on at least the same level as the guy he is playing with , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’d very much enjoy the task of blooding @entity97 — for want of a better expression — and i would love to play with him			0
we are talking about that happening			0
’ @entity7 has become world no 1 and won four majors since he was first paired with @entity6 in 2010 the @entity14 is crucial to @entity43 's hopes and @entity42 knows his pairings will be crucial from the outside at least , it is amazing to hear someone as tough under pressure as @entity6 speak in terms of an inferiority complex , as he does about @entity7			1
you would think it would manifest itself when under extreme pressure but as we all know , in this particular instance , it ’s the exact opposite			0
‘ i ’ve been lucky enough to hit a few good shots under the gun in my career , ’ said @entity9 ‘ i ’m a guy that certainly embraces the high - pressure scenarios			0
i guess i ’ve been blessed with some level of fortitude and i ’ve often wondered where i got it from			1
‘ over the past 10 years i ’ve worked it out that i got it from my mum			0
she ’s an @entity141 sufferer and a pretty tough cookie			0
two things she gave me are perspective and some strength of mind			0
i would love to get a chance to test it out again this weekend			0
’ @entity148 and @entity6 celebrate together after @entity43 's remarkable comback victory in 2012 the @entity43 team poses for a photo ahead of their attempt to win a third @entity16 in a row @entity6 hit @entity43 ’s last shot of the @entity155 and the first one two years later			1
in three appearances he has experienced losing and winning in @entity158 as well as being the hero at @entity3			0
‘ i ’ve certainly ridden that @entity16 rollercoaster , ’ he said , smiling			0
this time he is experiencing something slightly different — being part of a team who are heavy favourites			1
‘ it is an unusual scenario but we ’re very proud of the label , ’ he said			0
@entity6 helped @entity7 adjust to the competition as a rookie but the younger man has moved on ‘ we watched a video in the team room last night showing the growth of the @entity175 and how we ’ve gone from getting drummed in every @entity16 to the turning points with @entity177 and @entity178 to the present day where we ’ve won seven of the last nine			1
‘ what we ’re not going to do is get sucked in by that favourites tag			0
we like being favourites but it ’s important to play like underdogs			0
that ’s what we are going for			0
’ away from the course , @entity6 began this @entity16 qualifying process by getting married and ended it last month by becoming a parent			1
now it is back to playing big brother			0
after his struggles at @entity20 , he is ready to lead by example once more .			0

@entity25 pair have played together in last two @entity27

@entity6 says he and @entity7 are ' better friends than before '
@entity7 has had a public *dispute* with the management company they both used to share
