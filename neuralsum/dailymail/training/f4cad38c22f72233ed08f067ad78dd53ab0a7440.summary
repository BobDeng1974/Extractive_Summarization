@entity1 's @entity0 is expected to appear in a radical edge version with curved screens when it is unveiled on sunday			1
however , new reports claim the ground breaking handset could be prohibitively expensive - and that @entity1 is struggling to make the screen			0
both phones will be revealed at a special event in @entity11 before the @entity12 begins there on monday			1
according to a source at one of @entity1 's mobile carrier partners in @entity23 who spoke to @entity25 under the condition of anonymity , @entity1 is launching both the curved and normal @entity0 at high price points			1
' our source , who has seen @entity1 's new devices in person , tells us that the mid-level @entity33 curved @entity0 will cost carriers € 949 ( $ 1,076 ) , with the top - end @entity36 model priced at € 1,049 ( $ 1,189 ) — around € 50 more expensive than the comparable @entity37			2
' the same source also said the firm is having yield issues for the curved display , which could mean the handset is in very short supply when it launches			2
for the non-curved @entity0 , @entity23 pricing is € 749 ( $ 849 ) , € 849 ( $ 963 ) , and € 949 ( $ 1,076 ) for the @entity45 , @entity33 , and @entity36 models respectively - $ 100 cheaper than the curved version			2

the @entity63 giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival @entity66			1
and the curved screen has already been used in @entity1 's @entity81			2

@entity1 is a member of all three groups			0
this means that manufacturers have to choose which standard they use , and not every standard is supported across different charging points , for example			1
however , last year , components that support multiple standards on a single chip were released and in january , the @entity174 and @entity176 announced they would join forces to offer better wireless charging features			1
