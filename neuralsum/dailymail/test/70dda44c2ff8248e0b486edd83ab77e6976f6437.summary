@entity0 has hailed a pre-match team talk from skipper @entity2 about ending their run of four successive losses against @entity6 with giving the @entity8 players an extra edge on sunday			1
' it was a thing what was always in our minds			0
it was going through the team			0
everyone knew how important this game was , not only because it 's a rat race in the last games , but also because of the history of the last four games , ' he said			0
' @entity2 mentioned that in the dressing room before the game to all the players and it is something that you have in mind when you go on to the pitch			2
you saw how everyone was fighting for each other			0
@entity0 played his part in @entity8 's 4 - 2 derby win over @entity6 on sunday @entity2 's team talk inspired @entity8 to end a run of four defeats by their local rivals ' maybe after the first five minutes we were a bit like , ' what is happening here ? ' but after that we picked it up again and we did very well			1
and with the crowd behind us , it was amazing			0
' the @entity45 international also warned that @entity8 need to focus on the end of this season rather than thinking about challenging for the title next year			1
the 25 - year - old @entity49 , who has played a significant role in @entity8 's run of six consecutive wins , accepted rivals would have taken note of the 4 - 2 derby win			1

@entity6 captain @entity60 was fortunate not to be sent off for a reckless challenge on @entity62 blind and @entity64 celebrate after coming back from behind against their ' noisy neighbours ' @entity0 said : ' i think @entity8 is always a club that is fighting for the title			2
' of course other teams are watching us , but we have to watch ourselves this season , our own games , focus on that and then we will see where it ends ' we do n't have to watch for @entity59			2
we have to watch for our own games , we have to look at ourselves			0
every game is a final to the end and we have to believe in ourselves			0
