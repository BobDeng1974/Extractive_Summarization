it was meant to be the story of @entity2 breaking the @entity3 wicket - taking record and bowling @entity3 to victory in his 100th test but eventually this became the tall tale of a new @entity9 star			1
the perfect @entity11 script was ruined here on friday night by the giant figure of @entity14 who repelled everything that @entity2 and co could hurl at him to make his maiden @entity3 century at @entity19 and earn his side a deserved draw			1
@entity2 had finally taken his 384th wicket in test cricket when @entity25 captain @entity24 edged him to his great friend @entity26 at slip			1
yet that was to be the final @entity11 success in a gripping final day of this first test as @entity14 , batting with a maturity way beyond his batting position and his tender years , not only held out but went to his century in some style			0
what a mixture of emotions for @entity2 and @entity3 , who have been left in no doubts by @entity43 that they have to win this three - @entity3 series against a side the new @entity38 chairman condemned as ‘ mediocre			1
’ they failed at the first attempt in what became close to a carbon - copy of the last @entity3 played in @entity50 six years ago when @entity25 held on for a draw with nine wickets down after @entity3 had set them a vast target			1
the ultimate frustration spoiled the day for the great team man @entity2 , who punched the air and screamed his delight when he took his second and what turned out to be his last wicket of a gruelling day			2
@entity2 has had ups and downs since claiming @entity64 ’s @entity63 as his first @entity30 victim 12 years ago at @entity66 but now he had finally overtaken sir @entity67 as the most prolific bowler in @entity3 ’s @entity3 history			1
there was a warm embrace too from his captain cook , who has been one of @entity2 ’s closest friends in cricket ever since they journeyed together from an a tour in the @entity76 in 2006 to join @entity3 in @entity77			2
in the stands were @entity2 ’s parents @entity80 and @entity81 and his wife @entity79 who , together with his young daughters @entity83 and @entity84 , had travelled here for his 100th test and the excited expectation of an @entity3 record			1
meanwhile , up in the commentary box , @entity67 applauded a man who he sees as worthy successor to him as the holder of a record he has held for so long			2
@entity2 races away to celebrate after he claimed his record - breaking 384th wicket @entity2 is mobbed by his @entity3 team - mates after he broke sir @entity67 's long - standing record the celebrations were short lived , however , as @entity3 had to settle for a draw in the first test @entity2 is congratulated by @entity67 as he leaves the field following the day 's action in @entity50 @entity67 has a word with @entity2 following his bowling feat at the sir @entity106 @entity67 took 383 wickets in 102 tests between 1977 and 1992 but has relinquished that record to @entity2 @entity14 gets a pat on the back following his superb batting display on day five against @entity3 @entity24 provided stubborn resistance as @entity3 chased a precious seventh wicket on friday after dismissing @entity24 , @entity2 celebrates his 384th @entity3 wicket to break @entity67 's record @entity119 ' parents and his wife @entity79 ( centre ) applaud from the stands following his seismic wicket previous holder of the record @entity67 applauds @entity2 from the commentary box the @entity3 team form a huddle prior to the fifth day of the first test against @entity25 on friday @entity130 made a bright start on friday sending a ball to the offside past @entity3 skipper @entity26 but @entity130 would soon the be the first man to fall as he was caught out by @entity135 's delivery @entity136 was the next @entity25 batsman to be dismissed at the hands of @entity2 @entity14 leaves the field of play following his superb performance on day five against @entity26 's side 1			1
@entity147 252 yet any thoughts @entity3 had of celebrating both @entity2 ’s record and what would have been a priceless win were denied by a 6ft 7in 23 - year - old who provides genuine hope for the future of decaying @entity76 cricket			1
@entity14 is first and foremost a fast bowler but he has already been made one - day captain by @entity25 and now they can regard him , as sir @entity158 believes , a genuine all - rounder who can lead his maligned side forward			1
@entity3 had taken three of the eight wickets they needed on the final day in the morning session to take any remote chances of a historic @entity9 victory out of the equation and push @entity3 towards the winning post			2
@entity2 celebrates after equalling sir @entity67 's record of 383 test wickets @entity170 appeals for the wicket of @entity172 after his delivery hit the batsman 's front pad @entity170 and his @entity3 team - mates celebrate following @entity172 's lbw dismissal @entity2 become @entity3 's record @entity179 - taker with his 384th scalp against the @entity25 , surpassing sir @entity67 's mark			1
here , @entity182 looks at some of the @entity185 reaction which have poured in in response			0
' great moment for @entity2 and his family ...			0
. congratulations you deserve it ...			0
awesome ! ! ' - sir @entity67 ' congrats to the @entity192 @ jimmy9 @entity3 and @entity193 best ever ! ! ' - @entity194 ' @entity195 ' - @entity196 ' brilliant work by @ jimmy9 to surpass sir @entity67 as our leading @entity3 bowler			1
so proud of my mate			0
really happy @entity203 got the catch too ' - @entity146 ' a joy to watch @ jimmy9 £ 384 £ legend £ @entity206 ' - @entity208 ' congratulations to @entity210 on becoming the greatest			0
well done @entity212 from all at @entity193 ' - @entity213 ' well done @ jimmy9 truly deserved , a genius ' - @entity216 ' @entity2 's a very good bowler , but he ai n't no @ @entity218 ' - @entity217 ' well done @ jimmy9 what an amazing achievement			2

next target 500 wickets please			0
' - @entity238 yet after @entity130 and @entity239 , who became the only casualty between lunch and tea , had thrown their wickets away with two of the worst shots any side seeking a draw can ever have played in test cricket , @entity14 stepped forward to save the day			1
first the @entity251 shared a stand of 105 with his @entity3 captain @entity24 that ate up 32 priceless overs and then when @entity2 had claimed his historic victim in @entity257 , @entity250 joined his giant team - mate to clinch a draw			1
@entity14 ’s unbeaten 103 , sealed with two majestic straight boundaries off @entity135 , could have ended on 66 when @entity261 gave him out caught down the legside even though @entity2 barely appealed			0
technology rightly reinstated @entity14 who then , agonisingly for @entity3 , could have been caught in bizarre fashion when he drove @entity135 into @entity266 ’s boot at silly mid-off only to see the ball balloon up just out of the reach of the diving bowler			0
that was pretty much it for @entity3 , who could not ultimately force their way through a largely disciplined @entity25 on a pitch that refused to deteriorate and with the ball refusing to swing			2
it is difficult to be too harsh on them			0
@entity26 ’s declaration came at the right time , giving his side 130 overs to bowl @entity25 out and leaving them with very little chance of victory			1
@entity3 ’s six - man attack gave it their all but perhaps did not bowl enough yorkers when it became clear that neither pitch not conditions were providing any help for them			0
instead , as they invariably do , @entity3 ’s pace bowlers erred on the short side of a good length too often			0
@entity135 , preferred to the inconsistent leg - spinner @entity296 , may have taken four wickets in the first innings but he could add only one more in the second when he was most needed and is vulnerable to the returning @entity299 when these sides meet again in the second test in @entity302 on tuesday			2
@entity26 will start that match under pressure having failed twice with the bat and failed to secure the victory which would have reduced the chances of his side facing an ‘ inquiry ’ if they fail to win here , as @entity43 has promised			0
at least @entity3 can celebrate the success of @entity2 , who may have become @entity3 ’s leading bowler but still has to look up at 13 performers worldwide who have more wickets than him			2
surely the 400th wicket will come soon but a hectic schedule of 16 more tests over the next nine months is going to test his enduring fitness and stamina to its very limits			0
he needs to be wrapped up in cotton wool , told to concentrate solely on @entity30 , and treated like the gem he is			0
@entity3 , with two @entity30 to perhaps save the skins of their captain and coach , need a fit and firing @entity2 , at 32 , more than ever			0
@entity327 jumps for joy after he dismissed @entity239 just before the new ball was introduced			0

@entity2 took the wicket of @entity24 to break the record
@entity2 surpassed sir @entity67 's record of 383 test wickets
@entity3 declared on *333* - 7 in their second innings on day four
@entity26 's side set @entity25 an unlikely victory target of *438*
but the home side held firm on day five to force a draw
