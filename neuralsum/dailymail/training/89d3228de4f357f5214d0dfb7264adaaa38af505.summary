by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 22:27 est , 28 december 2013 updated : 09:32 est , 29 december 2013 this was the worst yet			0
a wretched , gruesome numbing defeat that not only leaves an @entity5 ashes whitewash very much on but also signals , more than the other three emphatic thrashings , the end of a great era for this @entity11 team			1
@entity13 ’s easy , no - nonsense eight - wicket victory within four days at the @entity14 is a new low simply because @entity11 threw the game away in the most culpable manner , as shamefully as anything seen in the darkest days of @entity19 cricket			1
this fourth test , with the ashes gone , was meant to be the start of something new for @entity11 , the first steps with a clean slate towards attempting to regain the urn when these old enemies meet yet again in just 18 months time			2
instead @entity11 betrayed a collective scrambled state of mind and a complete lack of confidence with a woeful display that sees them , incredulously , 4 - 0 down against an @entity5 team who had not won in nine tests before this series			1
@entity11 had their chances here far more than they had in @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			2
twice they were in position with the bat to finally put pressure on what remains a brittle @entity5 side only to blow it in as hapless way as can be			0
there is no defence for a first innings score of 255 , made timidly , after @entity77 had gifted them the chance to move into a commanding position by taking a real gamble in asking @entity11 to bat			0
and there is absolutely no defence for what must surely be the worst day of this tortuous tour , the third of this @entity88 , when @entity11 went into saturday as clear favourites to win only to firstly let @entity13 ’s last pair add 40 and then capitulate recklessly to 179 all out losing the last five wickets for just six runs			1
despite it all @entity11 still had hope in the morning session , particularly as @entity13 have proved themselves very nervous chasers in recent times , but it was quickly distinguished with two terrible fielding howlers in the first half hour			1
how different this @entity88 might still have been had @entity99 gone for the regulation chance to his left offered by @entity33 on 19 and then had @entity39 , perhaps still fazed by his keeper ’s poor judgment , not dropped an absolute dolly to reprieve @entity42 when he was on 22			1
it was a passage of play that highlighted @entity11 ’s muddled selectorial thinking in bringing @entity99 here as back - up keeper when there are not many who view him as @entity114 ’s successor and then the captain ’s scrambled brain			1
stay hit ! @entity33 was in free - scoring form as he passed fifty in the morning session got him ! @entity99 caught @entity42 off @entity121 ' bowling but it was too little too late from the tourists held aloft : @entity33 celebrates his fifty , which came up in 73 balls , and the opener rarely looked threatened hero : @entity33 was exemplary in scoring a ton and seeing @entity13 through the majority of their second innings top knock : @entity33 scored a cluster of his runs backward of square on the offside , as shown by our hawk - eye carry on : @entity35 was in at @entity139 and continued where @entity42 had left off , scoring quick runs at the @entity14 @entity42 , who rarely performs when he is actually under pressure , soon gave it away to give @entity121 , the one ray of hope from this series , a deserved wicket but the journeyman @entity33 , one of cricket ’s nice guys , made @entity11 pay			1
and @entity11 ’s body language betrayed a beaten , embarrassed side long before @entity33 , missed again by @entity99 on 81 , moved on to a popular century and @entity35 and @entity77 , passing 8,000 @entity88 runs , then completed the highest successful run - chase at the @entity14 in 50 years with contemptible ease			1
it is hard to see @entity11 raising themselves for one last push after this and if they do indeed lose in @entity159 next week this would be a much more humiliating 5 - 0 reverse than that suffered here in 2006 - 07			1
back then @entity11 had lost the spine of the side that won the @entity165 so famously in 2005 and were up against some truly great @entity5 players , led by @entity167 , who were hell - bent on revenge			2
this , at least judging by the last five years , is a much better @entity11 side than @entity171 ’s vintage and they are up against an ageing @entity5 team who had a similar test record to @entity175 in 2013 before @entity11 arrived			0
toil : @entity121 was @entity11 's main threat but even he found it tough going against the unforgiving @entity5 tried and trusted ? @entity39 opted to go with @entity179 instead of frontline spinner @entity180 for long spells clearly , though , @entity39 was right when he said before this match that maybe @entity11 ’s 3 - 0 victory last summer had merely papered over the cracks both in the @entity11 side and his own captaincy			1
@entity11 made a habit of claiming the big moments last summer against an @entity5 side who had seemed to have forgotten how to get over the line but this time it has been @entity77 who has had the upper hand in everything he has done			2
big change now seems far more likely at the end of this series than it did after @entity67			0
a lack of energy , imagination , tactical acumen and , yes , heart and desire appear far more worrying here than in the aftermath of losing the @entity165			0
@entity205 has gone , there are question marks over whether @entity208 and @entity114 will play for @entity11 again and there are those like @entity99 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity180 and @entity212 who could conceivably disappear after this tour			0
and who will remain to coach them is a moot point also			0
crestfallen : @entity217 saw an early catch go down and looked a beaten man in the field for the tourists smother : @entity33 batted sensibly and showed the @entity11 middle order how to carry an innings it is hard , for instance , to see @entity226 carrying on as batting coach after this			1
one of the greatest of all servants of @entity19 cricket will surely be too proud to watch the batsmen continually letting him and their country down			0
and what flower would make of a 5 - 0 reverse is key to what @entity11 do next			2
i remain convinced that there is no - one better equipped to guide @entity11 towards a new era than the greatest coach @entity11 have had but will flower feel that he has to be held accountable more than anyone and step down ? there is no appetite within the @entity245 for @entity234 to go but new managing director @entity246 may have a fight to persuade him to stay when he arrives in @entity159 to begin a term as managing director that he could never have imagined would start in a crisis such as this when he succeeded @entity252			2
nobody better ? @entity11 ought to stick by their coach @entity55 despite the humiliation @entity255 happy as @entity256 ! the @entity5 tactics had @entity259 's aggressive stamp all over them during this series there are questions , too , facing a selection panel which has got so much right over the last five years			2
@entity264 takes over as national selector having to explain how @entity11 have ended up with the wrong back - up keeper , three giant bowlers who could not be trusted to play and three spinners in the squad in @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity272 but no @entity205			0
it is a sorry old mess and one that has escalated beyond all comprehension over these past few testing weeks			0
last time they were at the @entity14 three years ago they retained the @entity165 and did the sprinkler dance in front of a delighted @entity279			0
this same @entity11 team have unravelled this time in a most brutal fashion here and the time has clearly come for them to start again .			0

@entity11 facing humiliating series whitewash after another dismal defeat
@entity13 romped to a fourth - straight win with eight wickets in hand
@entity33 scored a terrific century to ease the hosts home
captain @entity39 dropped two early chances to add more misery
