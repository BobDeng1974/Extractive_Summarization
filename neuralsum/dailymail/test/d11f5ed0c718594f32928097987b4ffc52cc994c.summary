@entity0 and @entity1 warned of a looming ' constitutional crisis ' last night after @entity4 's former first minister @entity3 was caught boasting : ' i 'm writing @entity7 's budget			1
' the two most high - profile conservatives joined forces to question the legitimacy of the @entity12 's plan to try to put @entity13 in @entity14 , even if @entity7 wins fewer seats at the general election			1
the @entity18 mayor , deployed to inject more passion into the @entity21 campaign , claimed it would mean ' truckfuls of taxpayers ' dosh growling up the @entity26 to @entity4 '			2
@entity1 and @entity0 joined forces yesterday to slam the @entity12 plans to prop up @entity7 ' lots of people … people who might even have voted @entity7 - people will think that this is a constitutional crisis , ' mr @entity1 said			1
the @entity12 has declared it will never support the @entity34 in a hung @entity35 , but is ready to do a deal with @entity7 , even if it finishes in second place			2
it would be the first time since 1924 that a second - placed party had formed a government			0
last night , secret footage of mr @entity3 yesterday raised new fears about @entity4 nationalists holding the balance of power at @entity46 after may 7			1
at a fundraising event , mr @entity3 , who is bidding to become an mp , is heard mocking @entity7 after it slapped down @entity4 leader @entity50 's claim that he would write a @entity7 budget north of the border			1
' i knew that already - because i 'm writing the @entity54 budget , ' he declared , to cheers and applause			2
mr @entity3 also joked that he would ' check his top pocket ' – a reference to a conservative election poster showing a miniature mr @entity13 in his breast pocket			1
@entity3 boasted that he would write @entity7 's first budget because the @entity12 would hold the balance of power the prime minister , in his first joint interview with the @entity18 mayor , his chief leadership rival , said : ' in the last 48 hours the @entity12 have said " no money spent on defence projects unless you get rid of @entity69			1
no @entity70 unless it starts in @entity4 "			0
' you have now got @entity3 saying he wants to write @entity13 's budget			1
that 's before this has even happened			0
imagine how much worse it would be , imagine how many pockets would be picked if this were to happen			0
' the stakes at this election have always been high			0
it 's about sticking with a plan that 's working or risking it with @entity13			0
but frankly the stakes have got much higher because of what 's happening in @entity4 with the @entity12 potentially wiping out @entity7			1
' the way to avoid that outcome which would be unstable , bad for the economy , bad for jobs , bad for living standards , bad for this country 's prospects , the way to avoid it is to vote @entity34			0
' what we have got to do in the remaining days of this campaign is bring together these arguments and show that there 's an absolute link between the danger of the @entity12 , a weak @entity13 , the threat that he 's making and the need to vote @entity34 to deliver that majority			2
' mr @entity1 , seeking to return to the @entity102 in the west @entity18 seat of @entity104 and @entity105 , said a @entity7 government dependent on the @entity12 's support would be ' totally shambolic '			1
the two high - profile @entity21 yesterday visited a school in south west @entity18 , where they made some hand paintings with the students the pair left the school together , where mr @entity1 claimed @entity12 's plans to prop up a @entity7 government would mean ' truckfuls of taxpayers ' dosh growling up the @entity26 to @entity4 ' ' you would have @entity7 at the beck and call of the @entity12			1
i care very strongly that they 've got an agenda to break up the @entity124 , but even worse in government … they would be dragging the steering wheel of a @entity7 government to the @entity129			0
' from my perspective where i sit in in @entity18 you would see truckfuls of taxpayers ' dosh growling up the @entity26 to @entity4			0
it would be a continual ransom by the @entity12 of a @entity7 government			2
' the mayor added that the polls were ' starting to move a bit ' in the @entity21 ' favour , and claimed there would be a late swing to them as there was in the 1992 election			0
' in the last week or so , i really think they 're really going to move decisively in favour of a strong , positive @entity34 message which is what we 've been offering			0
the record of the government over the last five years has been absolutely outstanding and i think the choice is very clear			0
' do you want to go backwards under @entity13 or forwards under the @entity34 ? loads of floating voters are going to make up their minds in our favour in the last few days			0
' tomorrow , the prime minister and outgoing leader of the @entity161 will inflame the row further by launching a separate ' @entity164 manifesto ' for the first time – as well as the traditional @entity4 , @entity168 and @entity167 documents			0
mr @entity13 dismissed mr @entity3 's claim as ' fantasy and nonsense ' – but again refused to rule out relying on @entity12 votes in a hung @entity35			1
@entity13 , pictured on the campaign trail in @entity174 yesterday , dismissed mr @entity3 's claims he would write the @entity7 budget as ' fantasy and nonsense ' the @entity7 leader also insisted yesterday that he had no plans to negotiate with @entity12 ' we are going to be writing the first @entity7 budget , ' he told @entity182			1
the @entity7 leader insisted he had no plans to negotiate , adding : ' i am going to put a @entity7 queen 's speech before the @entity102 and people will have to decide how they vote			2
' mr @entity13 also accused mr @entity0 of ' trying to stir up @entity164 hatred against the @entity4 ' by highlighting the threat posed by the @entity12 's left - wing agenda			1
in a separate interview , with the @entity190 , the @entity7 leader refused to rule out seeking to enter @entity192 propped up by other parties even if his party wins fewer seats than the conservatives			0
@entity197 , mr @entity3 's successor , yesterday set out another policy demand for the entire @entity199 – saying @entity12 mps would vote for a £ 24 billion increase in @entity203 spending			1
former first minister of scotland @entity3 said mr @entity0 had a ' sense of humour bypass ' after the prime minister reacted angrily to the leaked video responding to the leaked footage of him , mr @entity3 said mr @entity0 should ' try holding a few public meetings and meeting real people – and develop a sense of humour '			1
' the point made in a light - hearted way was that @entity7 leader @entity50 had been slapped down by his party bosses at @entity46 and told that he would have no role in a @entity7 budget , ' the former @entity4 first minister said			2
' @entity0 is clearly a prime minister with both a people bypass and a sense of humour bypass			0
' but @entity4 conservative deputy leader @entity224 said : ' here we have the @entity12 - @entity7 offer in a nutshell : a chaotic pact with @entity199 's future security treated like a dinner - party joke			1
' after @entity197 's slick con - trick earlier this week , this video shows the @entity12 's arrogance laid bare			1
' the only way to prevent @entity3 from trying to tear up @entity199 by holding a @entity54 to ransom is by voting @entity34			0
' conservative chief whip @entity237 , on a visit to @entity239 and @entity240 , rejected criticism of his party 's warnings about the dangers of the @entity12 holding sway over a weak @entity7 government			2
' what 's putting the @entity124 at risk is the prospect of an @entity12 victory in seats in @entity4 , and the reason why the @entity12 have been doing well is the collapse in the @entity7 and @entity255 vote			2
' it 's the conservatives who are the strongest party defending the @entity124 , the strongest bulwark against separatism			0
i think it 's absolutely right that we should underline the risks of voting for a party that wants to break up the @entity199			0

@entity0 and @entity1 last night warned of a looming ' crisis '
they joined forces to question legitimacy of @entity12 's @entity7 - boosting plan
mr @entity1 claimed it would mean ' *truckloads* of cash ' moving up the @entity26
it comes as mr @entity3 was filmed joking he would write @entity7 's budget
