sentencing @entity98 , recorder @entity117 said to @entity98 : ' no doubt you would have seen the fear in the eyes of the people you were robbing yet you carried on thereafter			2
' it was not a one - off , it was a course of conduct you decided to engage in quite freely for a few weeks			0
' this was professional , commercial robbery for significant financial gain where people were disguised and premises targeted that were vulnerable where people worked hard for not much money			0
' they were not the type of premises where workers would expect people like you to come in and rob the store			2
the only mitigation i can find other than your guilty plea is your youth			0
' speaking after the hearing , detective sergeant @entity146 , from @entity147 , said : ' the money and value of goods stolen , while significant , is nothing compared to the impact these offences have had on the staff members of the targeted premises			0
' these offences were carefully planned and the group went to great lengths to conceal their involvement , often using umbrellas as cover when walking from the street to the shops , so as not to draw attention to their face coverings			2
' however , the more offences they committed the more arrogant they became			0
there was also a clear escalation in the type of weapons used in the robberies and i am in no doubt they would have gone on to seriously hurt someone had they not been stopped			0
