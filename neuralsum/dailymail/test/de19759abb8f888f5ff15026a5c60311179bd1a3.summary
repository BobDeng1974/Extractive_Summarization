everyone is watching @entity1 ’s 19 - year - old left back @entity2 with @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 hoping to snatch him from under @entity7 ’s nose this summer			1
@entity9 's @entity8 takes a look at the @entity11 under 21 defender			2
why are @entity14 clubs so keen ? his buy - out clause is currently set at £ 13.5m			1
when you consider that @entity17 – of a similar age and potential – cost £ 27m it would be silly not to be interested ; although there would be also be reservations about his suitability to the @entity24			2
@entity2 ( right ) in action for @entity1 during a @entity27 match with @entity28 earlier this season reservations ? he flies forward very much in the style of @entity31 and @entity32			1
but those two left - backs who came before him at @entity1 are in sides that allow them to play at times as auxiliary wingers – one at @entity40 and the other for @entity42 at @entity43			1
there would be more defensive duties in @entity14 and he would be tested in the air			2
he has plenty of spring and good technique but at just 5ft 7ins it is not his strong point			0
basically , you ’re saying he ca n’t defend … no , not at all			0
he is lightning fast and that enables him to recover position very quickly as well as correct his own , or his team - mates ’ mistakes			2
he is also tenacious in the tackle – and aggressive enough to come out on top against bigger players			0
and he is 19 so a coach such as @entity62 would be able to improve him defensively			0
but what is indisputable is that his natural inclination is to attack			0
@entity2 is an attack - minded left - back who likes to get forward at every opportunity and he is very effective going forward ? much like the aforementioned @entity32 and @entity68 , and @entity70 ’s @entity69 , he grew up playing as a winger before gradually been moved back to full - back			1
he ’s not just an overlapper , he ’s very good off of both feet and can make runs inside to play through - balls or shoot			0
he also played as central striker before being moved wide and as an 11 - year - old whose idol was @entity80 , he scored 60 goals one season in @entity1 ’s academy			1
@entity11 already seem to be well - stocked at left - back so will he make it to the senior first team ? he has represented his country at every level since under - 16s and has tended to benefit every time @entity32 has moved up an age category , stepping into his place			1
he is currently first choice for the under - 21s			0
of course at senior level everyone stops moving up and as good as he is it will be hard for him to shift @entity68 and @entity32 ahead of @entity98 2016			0
@entity2 slides in on @entity100 midfielder @entity99 during last month 's match in @entity7 does he want to leave @entity1 ? he has supported the club all his life			1
hour - long trips from his home in @entity106 to train with them since age 11 have helped ingrain that affection but there is a reason why he has still not signed a new deal that would increase that £ 13m buy - out clause			1
if the offer is right and from the right club then he is ambitious and he will go			0
will he come to @entity14 ? @entity1 would rather do business with an @entity14 club than @entity7			1
but if the buy - out clause is met then there is little the club can do about deciding where the player goes			1
he ’s 20 in may and staying in @entity11 will be appealing			2
at @entity7 he will be just three hours away from his family and friends on the @entity126			2
he will want some guarantees at @entity7 however			2
@entity128 is first choice at the moment so how many games will he actually play ? a club like @entity4 could come in and promise far more first - team football which might sway him but @entity7 are favourites			1
@entity2 , pictured here at the 2013 under 20 @entity135 , has represented @entity11 up to under 21 standard @entity137 ( left ) talks to team - mate @entity139 during an under 19 international against @entity140 @entity7 bought @entity141 this week and now they want @entity2			1
and they already have @entity142 and @entity143			0
are they building a team of full - backs ? reserve full - backs @entity146 and @entity148 have been identified as two of the weaknesses of the squad			0
they want @entity141 and @entity142 contesting the right back position next season , and @entity137 and @entity128 the left - back spot			1
@entity148 and @entity156 will both be sold in the summer			0
there is also a @entity159 investigation into their signing of under - age youngsters currently ongoing			0
with a potential transfer ban hanging over them they want to cover every gap in their squad .			0

@entity2 has been linked with a number of big clubs in @entity11 and @entity14
@entity7 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 could fight it out
@entity1 left - back , 19 , has a buy - out clause in his contract of just £ 13.5m
he has been *impressive* all season for the @entity27 club
the attack - minded @entity2 has been *capped* up to under 21 level for @entity11
