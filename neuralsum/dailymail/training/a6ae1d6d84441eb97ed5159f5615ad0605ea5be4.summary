when @entity3 's reptile - mad daughter @entity1 begged her for a spooky - themed birthday party , she knew exactly how to make the day extra ssspecial			1
so the 37 - year - old , from @entity7 , @entity8 , did what any mother would for their little girl ... and decided to bake a birthday snake			2
she spent three days whisking , beating and carving delicate sponge layers into a lifelike albino @entity14 for the six - year - old 's big day			1
and when she finally brought out the white - chocolate masterpiece at the party , guests were n't sure if it was a snake or a cake			1
appetizer : despite its realistic appearance , @entity1 and her 26 friends loved the cake and fought over who was going to eat the head @entity3 , who bizarrely has a phobia of snakes , baked the equivalent of six sponge cakes before carving and sculpting them into the slinky appearance of the python , one of the most lethal non-venomous snakes in the world			1
the 37 - year - old spent a painstaking 12 hours decorating the unlikely birthday cake until it looked like a convincing albino @entity14 python			1
she used a white chocolate fondant and applied a special dye to make the skin and replicate the distinctive markings of the dangerous snake			1
@entity46 : and when she finally brought out the white - chocolate masterpiece at the party , guests were n't sure if it was a snake or a cake creative : she baked the equivalent of six sponge cakes before carving and sculpting them into the slinky appearance of the python , one of the most lethal non-venomous snakes in the world despite its realistic appearance , @entity1 and her 26 friends loved the cake and fought over who was going to eat the head			1
but some of their parents were left ' freaked out ' by it			0
beat her fears : bizarrely , @entity3 has a phobia of snakes mum - of - two @entity3 , a professional cake - maker from @entity7 , @entity8 , said : ' i made the cake for my daughter 's sixth birthday party			1
' we had recently been to the zoo and i asked her what cake she wanted for her birthday , and suggested a snake , which i immediately regretted because i have a real phobia of them			1
' but @entity1 said she wanted it to scare her friends as it was going to be a spooky themed party			1
' at first i could n't even look at the images of them online but as i kept researching them i realised they were n't so bad and had quite beautiful patterns			0
' once i had got over my phobia i just cracked on with it , although before i put the skin on it looked really creepy			0
' after i made him i had to keep him in a box and lock him away in a room , i just could n't look at him			0
' the children were fascinated by the cake and were n't scared at all , but their parents gave it a wide berth when they arrived and some of them were quite freaked out by it			2
' but then they started taking pictures			0
i think some loved it and some hated it			0
' everyone has told me just how real it looks			0
' @entity3 , who runs her business @entity115 from her home , lives with husband @entity117 , two - year - old son @entity118 and @entity1			1
@entity14 @entity119 are among the most deadly snakes in the world and kill by asphyxiating their victims - and swallowing dead prey whole			2
although they are not considered a threat to humans , @entity14 pythons are vicious and can eat anything from birds to large mammals			2
snake cake : @entity3 created the coiled up @entity14 python cake after six - year - old @entity1 begged her for a ' spooky ' themed birthday party following a trip to the zoo can you tell the difference ? @entity3 's cake , right , is so realistic , some guests thought it was a real albino @entity14 python , left icing with death : she used a white chocolate fondant and applied a special dye to make the skin and replicate the distinctive markings of the dangerous snake they come in various colours including black , brown , green and yellow and can grow to be 18 feet long and weigh more than 200 pounds			1
instead , they kill their prey by locking it in their jaws , which boast powerful , backward - facing teeth , then crushing it in their coils			0
they then swallow it whole			0
the real thing : @entity14 @entity119 are among the most deadly snakes in the world and kill by asphyxiating their victims - and swallowing dead prey whole their success is due to their ability to gorge on huge meals - and then go without food for months			2
after a big kill , the snake 's insides remodel themselves to cope with such a feast			2
their heart grows in size to produce more blood for digestion , extra stomach acid is produced and the intestines rearrange themselves			0
they are also expert swimmers and can often be found in the wild near water			0
some are even semi-aquatic , but can also be found in trees .			0
