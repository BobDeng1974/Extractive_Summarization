all @entity1 have to do , it seems , to go a long way in the @entity3 is play anyone other than @entity5			1
they romped to an emphatic nine - wicket victory over an awful @entity8 here at the @entity10 in the first of two warm - up games that are supposed to provide preparation for the big challenges ahead			1
instead @entity1 would have gained little other than a confidence boost from thrashing opponents who looked even more uninterested than the @entity19 side who sleepwalked their way through the tri-series			1
@entity23 ( right ) is congratulated by team - mate @entity24 after his five - wicket haul @entity23 led the @entity1 team off after his five - wicket haul reduced the @entity8 to 122 all out @entity27 also offered his congratulations to @entity29 following his excellent performance at the centre of the walkover was @entity23 , who went wicketless while conceding 89 runs against @entity5 last week but who now bounced back with a five - wicket haul gained at the expense of just 19 as @entity8 were bundled out for 122 in under 30 overs			1
@entity38 then led @entity1 home in company with @entity41 in the most comfortable of run chases after @entity43 , reprieved when caught off a @entity44 no ball on seven , had hit 46 off 43 balls			1
@entity8 bad attitude was summed up by the fact that @entity49 , who hardly exerted himself when he was dismissed by his first ball , did not bother taking to the field for @entity1 's reply			2
@entity1 have now won five out of eight matches on this tour but the trouble is that the three defeats have all come against an @entity58 side who will start as hot favourites for this @entity3 that begins in @entity61 on saturday			1
@entity23 ( third left ) is congratulated by @entity62 and @entity63 after dismissing @entity64 ( left ) @entity23 took 5 - 19 as @entity1 ripped through the @entity8 top order at the @entity10 @entity24 ( second right ) celebrates with his team - mates after taking the wicket of @entity69 @entity38 plays a shot as @entity1 successfully chased down the @entity8 total of 122 for a nine - wicket win still , if @entity1 continue the habit of dismissing inferior opposition then they can afford to lose at the @entity75 and still exceed expectations which saw them dismissed as complete no - hopers before they came here a month ago			1
this was a quite dreadful performance from @entity8			0
they simply did not appear to have any heart for the battle under cloudy @entity10 skies and with the greenish pitch offering seam movement and a little bounce			0
that was no real excuse for some of the pathetic shots played by a @entity8 team who on days like this are little short of an embarrassment to a region with such a rich and proud cricketing heritage			0
all , of course , is not well with the modern day @entity8			0
they quit their tour of @entity19 in october over a pay dispute and have arrived here without two of their best players in @entity104 and @entity105 as a consequence			0
@entity23 also removed opener @entity107 for 21 runs as @entity1 stamped their authority @entity24 appeals for a leg before wicket decision against @entity69 @entity27 bowls @entity113 for 10 runs as the @entity8 collapsed to 122 all out in @entity10 @entity1 celebrate after @entity49 is caught by @entity115 off the bowling of @entity29 for a duck @entity118 reaches for his sunglasses during the match in @entity10 even their opening press conference here on sunday was a tetchy affair with their normally affable media manager stepping in to stop innocuous questions to their new and very raw young captain @entity44 about @entity49			1
they will have to bat a lot better than this if they are to avoid falling victims to the ‘ minnows ’ in their @entity3 group in @entity136 , @entity137 and the @entity138			0
on this form a quarter - final place is far from certain for @entity8			0
the tone was set at the off when @entity23 , mauled by @entity5 in his last outing eight days ago , took two wickets with successive balls in the first over , @entity49 and @entity64 both being undone by a little extra bounce			2
this was an important day for @entity23 , who has had a good winter but who risks losing the new ball to @entity150 when the @entity3 begins in front of 90,000 on saturday			2
@entity8 certainly had much more difficulty in playing the @entity154 man than @entity5 did in the @entity156 final in @entity157 , with only @entity158 displaying any degree of permanence			2
@entity8 batsman @entity158 tries to lead the fightback - he made 45 before being dismissed @entity162 is bowled by @entity163 for seven runs as the @entity8 slumped to 67 - 6 at that point @entity23 was the standout @entity1 bowler as they made light work of the @entity8 in @entity10 @entity43 hits out as @entity1 set off on their run chase of 123 at the @entity10 @entity38 plays a shot as @entity1 easily reached their victory target for the loss of only one wicket @entity158 did hit one huge six into the famous @entity10 pavilion off @entity163 , who had bowled @entity162 with his first ball , but fell five runs short of his half century when he became one of @entity29 ' five victims			1
perhaps the worst of a catalogue of poor shots came from @entity113 , who played all round a straight ball from @entity27 , who was not at his best and was perhaps flattered by taking two wickets			0
other than @entity27 , @entity1 bowled well in the absence of the rested @entity150 and @entity185 , with both @entity163 and @entity24 taking the chances presented them by gaining practice against pliable opponents			1
there were also an important seven overs for @entity191 who , according to coach @entity193 , had ‘ not taken ’ the bowling opportunities presented to him so far on tour and came into this warm - up under a little pressure			2
there were no such concerns here , with @entity38 finishing unbeaten on 35 , and @entity1 can only hope for a more testing time when they face @entity201 here on wednesday			0
then it is the small matter of @entity5 again when it will really count .			0

@entity1 defeated the @entity8 by nine wickets in @entity3 warm - up
@entity23 took 5 - 19 as @entity1 bowled their opponents out for 122
@entity27 , @entity24 , @entity163 and @entity191 also struck
@entity38 and @entity41 guided @entity1 home in @entity10
@entity43 also made 46 as @entity1 gained confidence boost
@entity1 have won five of eight matches on this tour
but they *'ve* lost three times to @entity5 , their first opponents in @entity3
