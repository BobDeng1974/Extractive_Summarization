@entity0 is planning for another season with @entity2 as the striker edges towards triggering the clause that will extend his stay with @entity6			1
@entity2 , 33 , signed a 12 - month contract when he joined in august , with the option of another year included in the terms			1
he is , however , guaranteed that extra season if he starts 15 times and is currently on five , with four appearances from the bench			1
the striker , who was outstanding in last sunday ’s 3 - 1 win at @entity16 , was considered by @entity17 and @entity18 but @entity6 believe they were always his first choice , as he turned down @entity22 football with @entity23 , as well as lucrative offers from the @entity25			1
‘ it ’s just natural he will get another year , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ the option for a second year is based on number of starts , so it will come automatically			2
all i want is for him to enjoy his football and convey the winning mentality he has to the rest of the team			2
' i always thought his period at @entity6 would be a minimum of two years , because the option reflects that			2
‘ he could trigger the clause very soon , the way he ’s playing			0
but the clause is not in my mind , his mind			0
@entity2 is a phenomenal example for @entity6 's youngsters , including @entity61 ( left ) , according to @entity0 @entity2 worked his socks off in @entity6 ’s win at @entity64			1
far from his more familiar role as a target man , he played as an attacking midfielder in support of @entity69			0
he moved across the width of the pitch , as the heat map of his main areas of activity shows ( below )			0
and he put in a shift in his own box for corners too			0
not too shabby for a 33 - year - old			1
‘ he could have chosen any league in the world			0
he chose @entity6 because he wants to be successful			2
’ @entity17 had lined up a medical for @entity2 , only to turn their attentions to @entity83			2
@entity0 , though , insists @entity6 made their approach for @entity2 before then			1
‘ it does n’t matter , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ he ’s here and i see him as a gift from the footballing gods , and i am happy for him to enjoy it			0
’ @entity6 , meanwhile , have posted the best financial results in the club ’s history			0
the 2013 - 14 campaign saw turnover increase by 39 per cent to £ 120.5million , the first time @entity6 have gone through the £ 100m mark			1
it enabled them to achieve a record profit of £ 28.2m			0
@entity0 is thrilled with his attacking options and @entity2 could retain his place for the visit of @entity103			1

@entity2 scored twice in @entity6 's *victory* over @entity16 on sunday
@entity6 manager @entity0 has *claimed* signing of former @entity110 and @entity111 *frontman* is a ' gift from the football gods '
