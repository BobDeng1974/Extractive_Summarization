experts have for the first time shown that ‘ active and engaged television viewing ’ does help to speed up a change in language			0

language experts at the @entity20 found two particular features of pronunciation typically associated with @entity24 @entity23 that were becoming increasingly apparent in the @entity26 dialect among people who regularly watched the television soap opera			1
' our study shows that the programmes that we watch on television can help to accelerate changes in aspects of language which are also well below the level of conscious awareness , ' said study leader @entity38 , professor of phonetics at the @entity20 , in particular , this study was investigating why certain linguistic factors that are normally found within the @entity43 dialect in @entity24 were gradually entering into @entity26			1
the study looked at how watching the television soap @entity12 is altering certain features of the @entity15 accent			1
in particular , it looked at why certain linguistic factors that are normally found within the @entity43 dialect in @entity24 were gradually entering into @entity26 although this trend was apparent in people who had contact with friends or family living in @entity24 , there was a stronger effect for people who had strong psychological engagement with characters in @entity12 although this trend was apparent in people who had contact with friends or family living in @entity24 , there was a stronger effect for people who had strong psychological engagement with characters in @entity12			1
the study warned that @entity15 viewers accents and dialect can be altered by watching @entity12 , but what words are particularly affected			2
@entity15 would imitate the likes of hard man @entity71 by saying ‘ f ’ instead of ‘ th ’ , while ‘ l - vocalisation ’ has also been adopted , in which the ‘ l ’ sound in certain words is dropped			0
for instance : @entity78 becomes ' @entity79 ' @entity80 becomes ' @entity81 ' @entity82 becomes ' @entity83 ' people becomes ' @entity85 ' @entity86 becomes ' @entity87 ' for instance , people would replace the letters th with an @entity91 in words such as think and tooth			2
the results show significant correlations between using these features with strong emotional and psychological engagement by the viewers of this programme			2
however , the study also concluded that simply being exposed to television is not sufficient to cause accent change ; for someone ’s speech to alter , they need to regularly watch the show and become emotionally engaged with the characters			1
the authors caution that television and other forms of popular media constitute only one of many factors that help accelerate language change and other , more powerful factors , such as social interaction between peers has a much stronger effect on language change in this study			0
professor @entity121 added : ' we do n’t properly understand the mechanisms behind these changes , but we do see that the impact of the media is weaker than that of actual social interaction			0
' we need many more studies of this kind in order to appreciate properly the influence of television and other popular media on language change			0
' the study , funded by the @entity137 , was published in the science journal language .			0

@entity26 viewers of @entity12 have picked features of a @entity24 accent
this *includes* replacing @entity145 with an @entity91 in words such as think and tooth
this is the first study to show that accents can change if viewers regularly watch and engage with a soap
