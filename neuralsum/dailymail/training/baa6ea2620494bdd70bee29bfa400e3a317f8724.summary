by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:28 est , 16 october 2012 updated : 13:45 est , 17 october 2012 prince @entity2 wrote to seven departments in 2004 and 2005 the government has blocked the release of secret letters @entity2 wrote to ministers because they would ' seriously damage ' his political neutrality and his role as future king			1
the letters were requested under the @entity12 , but yesterday the attorney general stopped the release saying they were ' particularly frank ' and would ' potentially have undermined his position of political neutrality ' if published			1
he added that any suggestion he was ' disagreeing with government policy ' would be ' seriously damaging to his role as future monarch '			2
the @entity22 had previously ruled that two dozen ‘ black spider ’ letters – which @entity2 sent during the last @entity25 government – should be revealed			1
a judge said it was in the public interest to release the letters , which were described in court as ‘ advocacy correspondence ’ through which the @entity2 had sought to influence government policy			1
but yesterday the government ’s chief legal officer overturned the ruling			2
‘ the @entity2 is party - political neutral , ’ said @entity37			0
‘ moreover , it is highly important that he is not considered by the public to favour one political party or another			0
‘ this risk will arise if , through these letters , the @entity2 was viewed by others as disagreeing with government policy			1
‘ any such perception would be seriously damaging to his role as future monarch , because if he forfeits his position of political neutrality as heir to the throne , he can not easily recover it when he is king			1
’ critics of the prince said the public had a right to know what he was lobbying ministers on , and attacked the decision for protecting the @entity59 from legitimate public scrutiny			0
senior royal sources signalled the prince felt he had done nothing wrong and had a right to advise ministers			0
in 2009 it emerged that @entity2 had written letters – known as ‘ black spider ’ memos because of their scrawled handwriting – on issues such as eco-towns , hospital design and housing			2
former labour lord chancellor lord @entity74 said he had been ‘ bombarded ’ by the prince about matters including the @entity77			0
the subjects of the letters which were vetoed yesterday remain unknown , but they date from september 2004 to april 2005			1
they were requested under the @entity12 by a journalist from the @entity82 newspaper			1
it requested the chance to see letters between prince @entity2 and the @entity86 , the @entity87 , the @entity88 ( which is now the @entity89 ) , the @entity90 , the @entity91 , the @entity92 and the @entity93 the request was rejected by the seven @entity96 departments where the letters were sent			1
but last month an @entity98 at the @entity22 ruled that 27 letters qualified as ‘ advocacy correspondence ’ in which @entity2 expressed a view on the rights or wrongs of a particular policy			1
with these letters , the tribunal said , there was a ‘ public interest strongly in favour of disclosure ’			2
mr @entity111 said the prince was exploiting his privileged access to ministers , adding : ‘ those who seek to influence government policy must understand that the public has a legitimate interest in knowing what they have been doing			0
’ but yesterday mr @entity37 used the ministerial veto over @entity12 requests to order the letters be kept from public view			1
the letters of @entity2 , pictured during a visit to the @entity127 in @entity128 , will not be released he said they reflected @entity2 ’s ‘ most deeply held personal views and beliefs ’ and were ‘ in many cases particularly frank ’			1
it is now unlikely their contents will become known until after the prince ’s death			0
but senior royal sources insisted it was the prince ’s ‘ absolute right , even duty ’ to correspond with ministers over ‘ issues of national importance ’			0
the @entity146 criticised the decision			0
its director @entity148 said : ‘ the tribunal concluded that the @entity2 ’s lobbying on behalf of various charitable causes did not fall under the constitutional convention designed to educate the heir to the throne to become monarch			2
he is trying to change government policy , not learn about it			0
’ @entity158 , chief executive of @entity159 , which campaigns for an elected head of state , said : ‘ it ’s an open secret that prince @entity2 lobbies the government			0
what the public has a right to know is what he is lobbying for			0
’ the @entity82 last night announced a @entity22 challenge to the veto – on the grounds the @entity96 had acted unreasonably			2
but legal experts say the challenge is unlikely to succeed .			0

the @entity22 previously ruled that 27 of *30* letters should be revealed
heir to the throne wrote to government departments from 2004 to 2005
letters were requested under the @entity12
