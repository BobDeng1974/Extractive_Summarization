' @entity84 , the ubiquitous real estate mogul and golf course owner , told @entity86 that the @entity0 should be taking advantage of @entity1 's golf outings as a chance to build compromises with @entity91			1
golf ' is a perfect game to make friends and negotiate deals over , ' he said friday			2
but ' the only people @entity1 should be playing golf with are congressmen – legislators – and especially the opposition			2
' ' @entity1 should not be playing golf on the first day of bombings or after an @entity10 journalist is beheaded			2

' we grieve for @entity9			0
we mourn for his family and his loved ones , ' the statement read			0
