@entity0 considered the bombing of the @entity4 federal building 20 years ago a failure because the structure was still standing after the blast that killed 168 people			1
@entity0 also viewed himself as a ' @entity9 - type messenger ' and even suggested his defense team should receive $ 800,000 from the government , according an archive of documents donated by the convicted bomber 's lead attorney			1
the estimated one million pages of paper documents from @entity18 now fill 550 file cabinet - sized boxes at the @entity21 at the @entity22			1
the trove , which was delivered to the school where the attorney received his undergraduate degree in three phases since 1998 , only became fully organized late last year			2
although the blast killed 168 , including 19 children , the examiner concluded that ' in @entity0 's mind , he believed that he had definitely screwed up because he left the building still standing '			1
@entity0 was executed by injection in 2001 at age 33			1
co-conspirator @entity56 was convicted separately and sentenced to life in prison			1
even as he stood accused of orchestrating what until the sept. 11 attacks was considered the deadliest act of terrorism on @entity64 soil , @entity0 appeared to be driven by profit and thought his attorneys should be entitled to ' $ 800,000 ( after fees , taxes )			1
' ' if i 'm gon na die anyway , i want to make some money			0
not for me , but to try to make up for what my family has been put thru , as well as to shell out some ` bonuses ' to my legal team. , ' he wrote in one note to his defense team included in the archive			1
in another , he doodled a tank ramming a house and wrote : ' this is the @entity31 ! ... send out your women and children			0
we know you 're in there and we know you have bibles and a copy of the @entity90 ! ' the collection also includes a copy of a published cartoon showing 11 jurors frowning and one smiling , with an arrow pointing to her and the note : ' my choice , potential juror			0
' @entity0 was identified as a suspect in the bombing of the building , sentenced to death and executed in 2001 medical assistants run from the blast site after being told another bomb had been found on april 19 , 1995 this is one of over 500 boxes of attorney / client documents that were donated by attorney @entity18 an @entity4 police car decorated with kind words and a small @entity64 flag sits near the blast area @entity116 , executive director of the museum , said @entity18 was n't comfortable putting the material at an @entity120 institution ' because the feelings were so raw ' and his fears the collection could be perceived as ' almost a shrine ' to the convicted bomber			1
@entity116 said : ' it 's been a difficult collection to figure out how to let people know we have it available for research			0
' you do n't want to promote it			0
that 's not the right word			0
you do n't want to publicize it without coming across as being somewhat celebratory			0
' it 's almost like @entity139 records			0
you 've got a whole bunch of people who are rightly so sensitive to this			0
' besides the handwritten notes from @entity0 , the defense case files include reports of investigations , news stories , photos , recordings and trial exhibits			1
in 2001 , @entity18 published a book suggesting @entity0 and @entity152 could not have been alone in carrying out the bombing , @entity0 denied any knowledge of another collaborator , or presence of an accomplice who became known in the case as @entity159 no. 2			1
but the polygraph examiner , @entity160 , wrote there were ' indications of deception ' in @entity0 's responses related to questions about others involved			1
@entity0 provided a first - person account of the bombing during two days of interviews with @entity18 in september 1995			1

he told @entity18 that he did n't have the resources to conduct a ' solo war ' and was convinced he ' could have gotten away clean from this and continued on if i had anywhere to go			0
' ' i determined that the best way would be to continue on as the @entity9 type messenger instead of the @entity202 type revolutionary , that you could accomplish maybe two in one , ' @entity0 said			1
in the polygraph interview , @entity0 said when he was pulled over by an @entity4 highway trooper shortly after the bombing for not displaying a license plate on his car , he had ' several opportunities to kill the trooper , however , did not because he was a state official and not a federal official			2
' asked about events leading up to the bombing , @entity0 said ' action had to be taken ' after the 1994 passage of the assault weapons ban , but said he was n't certain at that time exactly what kind of action would be appropriate			2
in other notes , he also points to the outcome of the @entity224 siege near @entity225 as an influence			0
the building in downtown @entity4 falls in a dust cloud as it is demolished by explosives in may 1995 @entity56 seen leaving a @entity230 in may 1995			2
he is serving a life sentence for his role a view from the plaza overlooking the @entity236 site from may of 2001 ( file photo ) the entrance to the @entity236 is pictured at dusk in @entity4 in april of 2015 the files have numerous references to media coverage and @entity0 's sense that @entity18 was too cozy with reporters and tv producers			1
@entity0 complained to @entity18 in 1995 that he was granting so many television and newspaper interviews , ' i am afraid you are becoming addicted to the ` media bug			2
' @entity18 responded : ' if you want to keep the media on your side , they must be fed. ' in one note to @entity18 marked ' @entity256 , ' @entity0 told him if anyone ever approached him ' to ` lean ' on you to ` throw ' my case , please confide in me			2
' ' i am a realist , and i know our government , ' he added			0
' tdc - threat , duress , or coercion - is a standard			0
money or muscle can influence all but the most ideological			0
' in the interview with @entity18 detailing the bombing and his arrest , he recalled how someone at the jail watching television coverage of the bombing investigation told him he resembled a composite photo of a suspect being sought			0
then a court appearance for his arrest for carrying a concealed gun and knife during the traffic stop , he noticed increased police activity around the courthouse where he was held			0
after his bond was set at $ 5,000 , a woman in an adjacent cell told him : ' they think you 're the bomber			2
' ' and i said , ` no way			0
' and then here is where it becomes a blur , @entity297 , ' @entity0 told @entity18 .			2
