but for many , leaving things to nature did n’t offer a quick enough fix			2
after years of over-plucking , women are now going to desperate lengths to bring back their eyebrows			1
plastic surgeons report a surge in the numbers requesting transplants to thicken out their sparse , pencilled - in brows			1

there is also greater awareness now			0
‘ while i do have patients who have over-plucked , i also have women who come in with perfectly normal eyebrows who are looking for a thicker , fuller brow to rival the likes of @entity6			1
