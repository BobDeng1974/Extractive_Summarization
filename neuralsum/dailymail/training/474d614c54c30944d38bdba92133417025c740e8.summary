they may look like your average building sites , but these houses were created with nothing more than a 3d printer			2
the houses , one of which is five storeys high , were created in an industrial park in @entity13 's @entity12 province using new 3d printing technology			1
the incredible engineering , by @entity16 , was pioneered ten months ago when the company printed ten buildings - costing just £ 3,100 - entirely out of concrete using a giant printer			2
@entity13 engineers have created houses with just a 3d printer , including one which is five stories high the buildings were created in an industrial park in @entity13 's @entity12 province using pioneering 3d printing technology the printer works by spraying successive layers of recycled construction material to form the structure the smaller houses cost around £ 100,000 and hundreds have already been snapped up by buyers including the @entity38 government now they have taken the technology further to build the first @entity41 printed villas and the tallest ever @entity41 printed building			1
the homes are created using a printer which is 21ft tall , 32ft wide , and 500ft long , according to 3ders			2
the ' ink ' used is a mixture of recycled construction waste , glass , steel and cement which is sprayed on layer by layer until a thick wall is created			1
@entity55 , ceo of @entity56 , explained that the construction industry produces a large amount of carbon emissions , but with 3d printing , waste material can be recycled			0
this process also means that construction workers are at less risk of coming into contact with hazardous materials			0
the new technology could also lead to the building sites of the future could be far less noisy , more clean and easier on the eye			0
pioneering : the homes are created using a printer which is 21ft tall , 32ft wide , and 500ft long the ' ink ' used is a mixture of recycled construction waste , glass , steel and cement which is sprayed on layer by layer until a thick wall is created the construction industry produces a large amount of carbon emissions , but with @entity61 , waste material can be recycled the buildings were created by @entity16 who are behind the new technology the process is expensive , but at £ 100,000 a house the properties are cheaper than the average home			1
the display site also featured a single - story house pre-ordered by the @entity38 government , which will soon be shipped to its owner			0
mr @entity55 said : ' this house was printed within a single day , and is part of a total order of 20,000 units			0

@entity13 company create houses made with nothing more than 3d printers
buildings , up to five storeys high , cost around £ 100,000 to produce
engineers use a 500ft long printer and recycled construction waste for ' ink '
' ink ' is sprayed on layer by layer until thick walls are created by the printer
*thousands* of the houses have already been snapped up by *investors*
