by @entity0 published : 10:22 est , 25 august 2013 updated : 10:42 est , 25 august 2013 the @entity2 has spent £ 1.4 billion on redundancy packages for staff in the last three years with some receiving packages of more than £ 600,000 , figures show			0
some 2,299 bureacrats have been handed six - figure golden goodbyes since 2010 after their posts were axed under the government ’s health reforms			1
yet as many as a fifth have already walked in to new jobs within the health service and thousands more are expected to follow over the coming months			1
shadow health secretary @entity14 says ' the true cost of @entity17 's @entity2 re-organisation is slowly revealing itself ' after figures showed £ 1.4billion has been spent on staff redundancies in the past three years @entity21 ’s shadow health secretary @entity14 accused the government of ‘ siphoning ’ billions away from front line care to fund the lavish exit packages of executives			1
@entity2 staff typically receive one month ’s pay for every year served although senior managers can usually negotiate far more lucrative exit packages			0
the highest is believed to have been awarded to @entity30 , the former director of health at the now defunct @entity32 , who received around £ 600,000 when his post was abolished in april			2
under @entity2 rule , staff can be rehired and still take their redundancy package as long as they do not start their new job for one month			0
it is not known whether mr @entity30 has since been re-employed within the health service			2
the government ’s health reforms officially came into force in april and saw hundreds of @entity45 abolished and replaced by @entity47 - led organisations called @entity14 said : ‘ the true cost of @entity17 ’s @entity2 re-organisation is slowly revealing itself			1
‘ at a time when the @entity2 needs every penny it can get , we have a prime minister handing out gold - plated , six - figure pay - offs to thousands of managers and @entity55 to thousands of nurses			1
‘ billions have been siphoned out of the @entity2 front - line to pay for an unnecessary re-organisation no - one voted for and @entity17 personally promised would not happen			1
it is a colossal waste of money			0
‘ the money he has wasted on pay - outs for managers could instead have prevented the thousands of nurse redundancies we have seen on this prime minister ’s watch			2
it will be galling for any nurses who have lost their jobs to see the sickening scale of these pay - outs			1
’ only last week @entity2 figures showed that almost 5,000 nursing posts have been axed since the @entity75 came to power in april 2010			2
although the health service ’s budget has been ring - fenced , hospitals and health trusts have been ordered by @entity81 to save billions from their budgets and many have resorted to shedding front line posts			1
@entity85 of the @entity86 was quick to slam the new figures @entity85 , chief executive of the @entity88 , said : ‘ there is a severe danger that golden goodbyes for senior staff in the health service could undermine any savings the @entity43 reforms could bring			1
‘ if there was n’t a ring fence around health spending then may be @entity2 executives would n’t be so cavalier with their budgets by awarding such lavish payoffs			0
’ figures obtained by @entity21 from the @entity103 ’s annual accounts show that more than 32,000 managers have received redundancies totalling £ 1.4 billion			1
they included 330 pay - offs of more than £ 200,000 , 513 of between £ 150,000 and £ 200,000 and 1456 of between £ 100,000 and £ 150,000			0
but in july a report by the @entity108 pointed out that a fifth of the staff made redundant had already found new jobs within the health service			2
and with around 4,500 posts in the newly - created bodies still to be filled , many more are expected to follow suit			0
a @entity103 spokesman said : ‘ last year we started changes that put doctors and nurses in the driving seat as they are best placed to take decisions about care for their patients			0
‘ the changes made as a result of the reforms mean a huge net gain for the taxpayer			0
they will save £ 5.5 billion during this @entity131 and £ 1.5 billion every year thereafter , to be reinvested back into patient care			0

more than 2,000 *bureaucrats* have received six - figure golden goodbyes since 2010
as many as one - fifth have already walked into new jobs
@entity21 slams @entity17 and says ' true cost of service 's re-organisation ' revealing itself '
