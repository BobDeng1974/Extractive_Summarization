if you usually doze off with your back to your partner and a gaping space between you , you 'll be pleased to hear you 're not alone			1
a new study into the most common sleep positions for couples revealed the ' liberty ' position , sleeping back - to - back without touching , was most popular with 27 per cent of couples pinpointing it as their regular nighttime stance			1
it may not ring of romance but relationship psychologist @entity15 , who carried out the study on behalf of bed specialist @entity17 , believes there 's hidden clues to a strong relationship in the non-tactile pose			1
the way we sleep speaks volumes about the state of our relationship , say psychologists ( picture posed by models ) psychologist @entity15 believes sleep position can speak volumes about the state of a relationship ' it shows the couple is connected and secure , ' says ms @entity15 , who says sleep positions can speak volumes about the state of a relationship			1
so what does your sleep stance say about your relationship ? @entity43 : back - to - back without touching some 27 per cent sleep in this position with plenty of space keeping them apart			1
ms @entity15 said that couples who adopt the @entity43 are : ' connected and secure in themselves , this position shows both closeness and independence in the relationship			1
' cherish : back - to - back touching ' a quarter of pairs ( 23 per cent ) like to sleep separately , facing different directions - and is often a sign of a new romance			1
ms @entity15 said that it means that , ' both partners are relaxed and comfortable with one another – this is often common in new relationships			1
' ' @entity65 ' and the ' lover 's knot ' were found to be the third and fourth most popular positions spooning : front - to - back touching the classic loving sleep position although one of the most famous , is only adopted by a fifth ( 18 per cent ) of couples			1
ms @entity15 said it 's a ' traditional position ' and demonstrates a dynamic , ' where one partner takes a protective stance over the other			0
' lovers ’ knot : face - to - face , the most complex position in which a couple lies facing each other , with their legs and arms intertwined for ten minutes before they separate , is a sign of relationship strength			1
yet only eight per cent adopt this complex position			1
ms @entity15 said it 's , ' a compromise between intimacy and independence , allowing for the best of both worlds			0
' he may feel like superhero but do you ? sleep positions can be an insight into a relationship superhero : starfish position women may hold out for a hero but when it comes to going to bed it 's the last thing you need			1
some three per cent of selfish sleepers adopt the starfish position , pushing the other partner so they 're hanging off the bed			1
ms @entity15 's verdict is that : ' one partner dominates the space , while the other takes a secondary role			0
' the romantic : resting head on chest this intimate posture , in which one partner rests their head on their partner 's chest , while their legs are intertwined is often seen in early relationships			1
adopted by four per cent of couples ms @entity15 explained it ' represents vibrant , passionate or rekindled love			1
' couples who sleep face - to - face , as in these positions above , are in the minority pillow talk : face - to - face without touching with space between them but their bodies mirroring each other , only three per cent of couples lie in the pillow talk position			1
but ms @entity15 noted that it could indicate an emotionally demanding union			0
' this position shows a need for intimacy and close communication			0
' the lovers : face - to - face with legs intertwined all night there 's a reason only two per cent of pairs lsleep lying so closely intertwined			1
ms @entity15 said that although it 's ' romantic and very intimate , this position also shows a lack of independence from each other			0
' despite sleep studies showing that 94 per cent of couples who spend the night in contact with each other are happy with their relationship , ms @entity15 believes autonomy in the bedroom is no bad thing			1
and considering 25 per cent of couples argue in bed because they are kept awake by their partners , it 's no surprise one in five @entity169 couples choose to sleep in separate beds			1
which of these rings true in your relationship ? physiotherapist @entity174 , author of @entity175 , also believes couples should not resist sleeping apart if it means a better night 's sleep			1
she said : ' more often than not sleeping separately has nothing to do with a couple 's relationship and everything to do with their urgent need for a better night 's sleep			2
' often it starts when one partner has an episode of illness , such as a cough , heavy cold or back pain , and moves temporarily to another room so as not to disturb their partner ( or in some cases to the sofa ) and they both enjoy such a good night ’s sleep that they decide to keep it that way			1
she also point out that men and women sleep differently : ' men spend more time in stage one sleep and women spend more time in slow wave sleep			2
' hormonal fluctuations due to the menstrual cycle can also disrupt sleep for many women , not to mention the fact that women with curves have different mattress needs to men without curves			2
' in short , men and women have different sleep needs			2
' statistics show that people who sleep poorly have a higher divorce rate - so if you persist in sharing a bed despite having your sleep disrupted , you risk not just poor performance at work , reduced concentration and poor health but problems in your relationship			1
' physiotherapist and sleep expert @entity174 explains how to share a bed without losing sleep : problem : snoring what to do : one thing you might want to do if your partner snores is to record him or her snoring			2
a regular tape recorder or video camera will do			0
often the first steps in coping with snoring is getting the snorer to believe there is a problem			0
with the evidence in your hands , you can move on to fixing the problem			0
another strategy is to go to bed first			0
if you are in deeper stages of sleep when your partner comes to bed , his or her snoring is less likely to interrupt your sleep			2
problem : restless sleepers what to do : your partner could have restless leg syndrome or a related condition called periodic limb movement during sleep so a check up at the gp is advised to rule this out			2
if allergies are the problem antihistamines can be the answer or simply cleaning your bedroom and airing your bed more during the day			0
check out too that you are n’t using washing powders that are causing irritations			0
buying a bigger bed makes sense			0
many standard double beds are simply too small so buy the biggest bed you can			0
if this is n’t possible try a mattress that zips down the middle or try putting two single mattresses on one bed ; this way you are far less likely to be woken with a kick			0
problem : differences in body heat what to do : the obvious answer is to buy and use separate single duvets			0
you can then both choose the duvet weight and comfort level that you want			0
do n’t forget to that a cool room is optimal for good sleep			2
wearing lightweight natural fibres such as cotton in bed will also help regulate body heat			0
problem : you 're a lark , they 're an owl what to do : replace any bedside lamps with reading lights as they are less @entity314 should also both invest in an eye mask to block out all light			0
if you ’re a lark and your partner is an owl it ’s probably best if only your partner wears the ear plugs			0
this is because one of you needs to be able to hear an alarm and it ’s easier for a lark to sleep through when an owl goes to bed than it is for an owl to sleep through when a lark gets up			2
we sleep more lightly in the second half of the night , so if one of you gets up early , the other is likely to wake more easily			2
larks who sleep with owls should also try to put their clothes out ready in another room so that they do n’t rustle around in the morning when they are getting dressed			2
owls should return the favour at night by getting ready for bed in another room			0
pay attention also to the layout of your bedroom so that an owl does not have to pass the lark ’s side of the bed at night .			0
