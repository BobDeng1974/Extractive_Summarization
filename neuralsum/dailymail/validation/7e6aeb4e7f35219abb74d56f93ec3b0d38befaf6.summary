we 've lost two key players at the top of our order ( @entity97 and ) @entity107 was the number three , we 've lost some players and we accept that , we do n't make an excuse of it			0

but , well done @entity8 ! you deserved it !

' we 've picked guys who can play a brand of cricket that if we performed we could win this @entity28 but ultimately we have n't performed , ' he told @entity226			0
' it 's pretty poor , obviously to be knocked out of a @entity28 this early is unbelievably disappointing			0
i 'm gutted at the moment			0
we 've struggled and fought away since we arrived here			0
' one of our big things was to fight quite hard and to try and get through to the quarter - finals and then from there fight our way through the last three games but obviously that 's not meant to be			0
' @entity25 added : ' it ultimately comes down to performance and today was an example of where some of our guys performed but we did n't perform as a unit and we 've done it for quite a while now			0
' since we 've landed in @entity42 we 've tried to address that problem but it has n't worked			0
