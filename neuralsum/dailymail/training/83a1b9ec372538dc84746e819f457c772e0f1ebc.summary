by @entity0 when @entity1 was told off for breastfeeding her youngest child in a café , she decided to fight back with humour rather than outrage			1
but ms @entity1 , 36 , never anticipated that the folksy pop song she penned and uploaded online to make fun of the anti-public breastfeeding lobby would strike such a chord with mothers around the world			1
the tongue - in - cheek @entity12 - which she performs with 31 - year - old @entity14 , the other half of her band @entity16 – recently hit more than half a million views on @entity18 and when combined with hits on @entity21 the song has been viewed over 800,000 times			1
' taking every chance they get to ruin your day with t * ts			1
' pretending their little ones need a comfort or a feed			0
' taking every chance they get to ruin your day with t * ts			2
' ms @entity1 said she and ms @entity14 , both from @entity43 , had been blown away by the response around the world and the song had been translated into 10 different languages			1
the music video has received more than 800,000 views across @entity18 and @entity21 the video pokes fun at people who get offended by new mothers breastfeeding in public ' we 're so grateful for the response we 've got and we 've just been thrilled , ' she told @entity58			1
' hopefully people will lighten up about the issue and take the pressure off breastfeeding mums			2
' ms @entity1 , a mother of four children aged between 15 months and 15 years , was breastfeeding her youngest child when another café customer made a snide remark under his breath			1
' i was just breastfeeding in a café and he was a young man who obviously thought i was ruining his day by feeding my child , ' she said			2
ms @entity1 was inspired to write the song after a young man said something snarky to her when she was breastfeeding in a cafe ' to be honest i 'm paraphrasing him but it was along the lines that i should have a bit more respect			1
' i was quite floored at a time			0
i 'm not quite sure how respect comes into it			0
' rather than respond directly to man , she used sarcasm to write a song and she thinks that 's what helped the video go viral			1
' [ the breastfeeding in public debate ] has always been tackled from someone getting criticised and then it comes up in the media but we took the issue on head on , ' she said			2
' because we used humour , instead of a responsive reaction , i think it 's been empowering for people and i think that 's why people have got behind it			0
the folk duo decided to fight the stigma against public breastfeeding with humour rather than outrage ' i guess what we were trying to do was put the attention on the bystanders rather than the feeders			1
' since releasing the song in february the folk duo have performed at the @entity114 and they are in talks to take their show to the @entity117 next year			0
they 're also currently producing their next film clip which will be released in early july			0
ms @entity1 says the song is similar to @entity12 and makes light of a social issue			1
' it 's something probably a bit more comical but we 're looking at the battle of the sexes , ' she said			0
ruin your day has since been translated into 10 languages ' it 's kind of a marriage - related topic which we 're keeping under wraps			2
' while the response to ruin your day has been mostly positive , they have received some nasty comments online			0
' like anything when things go out on @entity18 you only have to read the comments to see people 's negative feedback , ' she said			0
' but not directly , we have n't had any direct negative comments			0
' we 're certainly aware that our view is n't the view of everyone			0
for us that just shows there 's even more reason to put it out there			0
