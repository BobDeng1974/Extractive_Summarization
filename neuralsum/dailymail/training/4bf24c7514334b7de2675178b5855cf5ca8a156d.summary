whether i ’m glammed up for a night out or sitting at home on the sofa , i would n’t dream of going without lipstick			1
the reason ? my natural lip colour is very pale and without a touch of lippy i look positively cadaverous			2
for this reason i have worn lipstick or gloss every day since i was 13			1
this vanity costs me a small fortune — almost £ 50 — as i get through two or three products every month			2
i ’m always on the lookout for the holy grail of lipsticks , one which goes on and jolly well stays put			2
so , when i heard about the new @entity16 by @entity17 and the company ’s claim that it lasts for a full day without smudging off , i could hardly contain myself			1
can this be true ? the boffins at @entity17 may have tested it scientifically , but i decided to put it , and five competitors , to a rather more practical test			1
each lipstick was subjected to the rigours of me eating a sandwich , drinking a glass of wine and			1
here ’s how they fared			2
you need a steady hand , but the result is smooth and even			2
it has a matte finish though the texture leaves my lips feeling a bit dry			2
the colour is a vivid pink — much brighter than i would normally use — but i rather like it , especially now that i have a bit of a tan			2
the test : i made some sandwiches with sliced white bread to show up any lipstick that comes off — not hugely classy perhaps , but effective			1
as i bite into a smoked salmon triangle , a half - moon shaped stain instantly appears			1
whoops , there ’s another bit of lipstick gone			1
but when i look in the mirror , my lips are as bright pink as when i started			2
feeling rather perky , i take a sip of prosecco , which leaves a glowing crescent on the glass			1
next , i haul mr @entity73 out of his study for a ( reasonably ) passionate kiss			1
you ’d think he would be thrilled at a bit of affection from his wife , but he seems more concerned with returning to his computer			2
afterwards my lips are still bright pink , which is impressive , but so are my husband ’s			0
he rubs at his mouth in disgust with the back of his hand			0
verdict : a great deal has come off , yet my lips still look great			0
mr @entity73 may just have to get used to it			0
@entity92 : 7/10 @entity93 left behind : the @entity17 lipstick leaves it 's mark on @entity37 , but overall @entity35 is impressed no staying power @entity93 in @entity97 at @entity98 , £ 4 application : this is a pleasant , glossy light pink and feels expensive and moisturising as i carefully draw it around my lips			1
the result is a demure rose colour			0
i look as though i am going to a summer garden party			0
the test : there is a pretty pink rim on the bread after my first bite of sandwich , and as i sip from my glass a bright mark instantly appears on the side of the glass			1
i suppose if i were actually at a summer garden party at least i would n’t lose my drink			0
a smooch with mr @entity73 leaves me looking like a clown			0
i gather , from his under - the - breath mutterings , that he is less than impressed with this one which comes off as easily as it went on			1
verdict : a lovely lipstick , but there ’s little left on my mouth and too much all around it			1
@entity92 : 4/10 @entity131 - @entity130 @entity132 by @entity133 , £ 15.50 , debenhams.com application : debenhams tell me their best - selling lipstick this year is @entity133 ’s @entity132 — almost 4,000 units have flown off the shelves after @entity139 declared that it is : ‘ extra matt , red , lasts all night long ’			1
it feels very dry on my mouth but the final effect is an even and bright red			0
the test : when i take a bite of my sandwich there is barely a mark left on the white bread			1
i have to peer at the edges in bright daylight to see even a smidgen of smudge			0
it ’s the same with my wine glass — a mere whisper of pigment is left behind			1
after a quick smooch with my husband ( if i ’m honest , they ’re getting less enthusiastic ) there is barely a hint of red on him and my lips still look fantastic			0
verdict : there ’s a little staining around my mouth , but my lips remain bright red			0
@entity92 : 8/10 sandwich a @entity169 : @entity35 ( wearing @entity170 in @entity171 ) makes a mark on her lunch vamping it up @entity170 in @entity171 , £ 3.99 , superdrug.com application : this is a magnificent and intensely coloured lip gloss with a rich and creamy texture			1
the bottle is squat and looks as though it contains nail varnish rather than lip gloss			0
the short sponge applicator makes it easy to apply and the gloss smells delicious			0
a deep colour and gorgeous , glamorous high - shine finish			1
the test : i ’m afraid this makes a bit of a mess			0
there is a semi-circle of scarlet on the sandwich and you could pick out my glass from across a room , such is the brilliance of the hue after just one sip			1
they both look as though i might be bleeding			0
my husband appears to have been in a fight , rather than a loving embrace with his wife			0
and i resemble a vampire who ’s just feasted on a victim			0
verdict : it looks great at the start , but it comes off super quickly — and the result ai n’t pretty			0
@entity92 : 2/10 @entity213 or white ? though @entity215 likes the @entity218 lipstick 's colour , it comes off ' super quickly ' , and it ai n't pretty @entity219 semi-permanent @entity220 in @entity221 , £ 4 , stargazer - @entity222 application : this looks like a neon marker			1
i feel as though i am drawing on my mouth rather than applying lipstick			1
once on , i look a bit muttony — this colour is too bright for anyone over 25			0
the test : they claim this lasts 24 hours , and indeed it is quite extraordinary			1
no marks are left on the bread , glass or husband			1
when i pick the children up from school ( looking as though i ’m off clubbing , such is the glow - in - the - dark quality of my lips ) i also test it on them			1
they loathe lipstickey kisses , but this does n’t leave a trace on them either			0
even when i vigourously rub my mouth with the back of my hand , there ’s just a light orange stain			0
it takes five minutes ’ elbow grease and three make - up removal wipes to get it off			1
verdict : impressive and certainly does what it says on the tin			0
in fact , it lasts longer than 24 hours			2
i draw some on my hand on friday night and it ’s still there on sunday morning , in spite of my having , obviously , washed a few times in the interim			0
@entity92 : 9/10 @entity271 rouge @entity272 and @entity273 in @entity274 by @entity275 , £ 19 , @entity276 application : it smoothes on evenly and the lipstick ’s thick , creamy texture gives my mouth a misleadingly youthful plumpness			2
i look elegant and sophisticated			0
this is by far my favourite colour			0
the test : as i bite into my sandwich , i can feel the lipstick coming off on the bread , as though i am using it to blot my mouth and a light plum shadow is left behind			1
it ’s the same on the glass — there is a faint imprint of my lips			2
i ’m afraid that some also came off onto my husband			0
he wandered off to walk the dog with a purple smudge on his left cheek			0
verdict : there is little lipstick left but my lips feel wonderfully moisturised and i do n’t mind reapplying in the least			2

@entity17 claims their new @entity16 lasts all day
lipstick - addict @entity35 puts it and five competitors through their paces
each lippie *undergoes* three tests : biting a sandwich , drinking from a wine glass and the all - *important* kiss
