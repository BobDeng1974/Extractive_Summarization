the @entity2 ' new health conscious cookie options have been put to the ultimate taste test by two children recruited by @entity5 to review the recently - launched recipes			1
earlier this month , the @entity2 announced the launch of three new cookie flavors - @entity9 , @entity10 - tastic and @entity11 - the first two of which are gluten - free , while the other contains a healthy mix of raisins , oatmeal and @entity19 yogurt			1
but do the healthier cookie alternatives measure up to the high standards set by their predecessors ? according to @entity5 's budding taste testers - one of whom is the daughter of @entity28 's own food critic @entity27 - the answer is a resounding no. cookie creations : the @entity2 announced earlier this month that they were adding three new flavors to their cookie line - up sweet treat : the gluten - free toffee - tastic flavor is described as being ' buttery with sweet , crunchy golden toffee bits ' less than impressed : @entity5 's young food critics were unimpressed with both the @entity11 ( @entity37 ) and the @entity9 ( r ) cookie flavors upon tasting one of the gluten - free trios , which are made with real peanut butter , chocolate chips and whole grain oats , @entity44 and her classmate @entity45 , both 11 , were quick to deliver their - overwhelmingly - negative reviews of the treat			1
' it does n't even look very appetizing to me , ' @entity45 explained , before even tasting the cookie			0
' it 's weirdly shaped			0
' @entity44 on the other hand , at least waited to sample the baked delight before deeming it to be ' rigid ' , with an odd texture that crumbles bizarrely in your mouth			0
both girls also pointed out that the @entity9 are n't packaged in the traditional girl scout cookie boxes , but instead are wrapped inside a plastic pouch			0
moving on to the @entity11 cookies , which are described on the @entity64 website as ' new hearty oatmeal cookies packed with plump raisins and @entity19 yogurt - flavored chunks ' , the girls were again left wanting in terms of flavor and ingredients			1
classic : two of the new flavors come packaged in the traditional girl scout cookie boxes odd one out : for some reason , the trios are sold in plastic pouches while @entity45 described the cookie as ' okay ' , @entity44 revealed that she was n't sure raisin and oatmeal really worked as a flavor combination ; both girls were unable to taste the @entity19 yogurt			1
' i was expecting to bite into a gooey raisin , but there was something else â€” maybe white chocolate ? ' @entity44 added			0
' it definitely tasted like a health cookie , or a cereal cookie			0
' both @entity44 and @entity45 were big fans of the iconic @entity92 , arguably the most popular cookie sold by the @entity2 , which was also the only one that both girls were able to recognize			2
when it came to some of the other classic cookie flavors however , the results were equally underwhelming , with both girls insisting that the peanut - butter based @entity92 were too salty , while the @entity103 were too ' lemon - y ' .			2

the @entity2 *introduced* three new health - conscious cookie flavors to their line - up earlier this month
toffee - tastic and @entity9 are both gluten - free , while @entity11 contains oatmeal and @entity19 yogurt
@entity5 *enlisted* two young cookie fans to test out the new flavors
