apology : @entity1 at @entity2 on thursday following the outcry over his comments @entity1 was forced to apologise last night after a joke he made about executing public sector workers for going on strike triggered a political row and thousands of complaints			1
the outspoken tv presenter faced a storm of protest after saying public sector strikers should be ‘ executed ’ in front of their families			1
in a day of extraordinary overreaction to what was clearly meant as a joke , one union official threatened to report him to police , while another said his comments were worthy of @entity24			1
even the prime minister , a friend of mr @entity1 , was dragged into the row , describing the remarks as ‘ silly ’ , while @entity28 said they were ‘ disgusting ’			1
by yesterday evening , when mr @entity1 was finally forced to issue an apology , the @entity30 had received almost 5,000 complaints about the interview on wednesday night ’s edition of @entity35			2
the row erupted after millions saw the @entity39 host asked for his views on the day ’s nationwide strikes			1
he started by saying he liked the strikers , because the industrial action had meant there was no traffic on the roads			2
but after insisting he had to be balanced as he worked for the impartial @entity30 , he launched into a satirical rant			2
he said : ‘ frankly , i would have them shot			2
i would have them taken outside and executed in front of their families			2
’ later in the show , he also complained about people who commit suicide by throwing themselves on railway lines , saying trains should not stop for them			2

labour leader mr @entity28 said the remark was ‘ absolutely disgraceful and disgusting ’ , adding : ‘ he obviously does not understand the lives of the people who were going out on strike yesterday			1
’ the unions exploded in fury , with @entity93 calling on the @entity30 to sack the presenter and even contacting lawyers to consider whether he could be reported to the police for inciting violence			1
@entity70 , @entity93 ’s general secretary , said : ‘ @entity35 is broadcast at a time when children are watching : they could have been scared and upset by his aggressive statements			2
‘ while he is driving round in fast cars for a living , public sector workers are busy holding our society together : they save others ’ lives on a daily basis , they care for the sick , the vulnerable , the elderly			2
‘ they wipe bottoms , noses , they help children to learn , and empty bins – they deserve all our thanks – certainly not the unbelievable level of abuse he threw at them			2

‘ @entity1 ’s incitement to violence , and the refusal of @entity80 to roundly condemn it , is grossly offensive to all public sector workers but even more so to our members on the @entity145 who were on strike on wednesday and who risk their lives in trouble spots around the world servicing the @entity153 fleet , ’ he said			1
@entity154 , of the @entity156 union , said : ‘ @entity1 ’s vile and offensive comments are insensitive in the extreme			1
