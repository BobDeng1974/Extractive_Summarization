by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 a hole - in - one is reward enough for every golfer on the planet , but the prize being offered for an ace at the @entity9 this week is simply out of this world			1
the first player to get down in just one stroke on the 163 - yard 15th hole at the @entity14 will quite rightly feel over the moon - because they will bag themselves a trip into space			1
it is the first time such a prize has been offered at a golf tournament			0
a life - size model of the spacecraft ( a @entity26 @entity25 ) that will take the winner into orbit will be displayed next to the 15th green throughout the tournament			0
@entity31 : @entity32 of @entity33 and @entity34 , tournament director of the @entity9 , stand next to the model of the @entity37 spacecraft by the 15th hole at @entity39 & @entity14 in @entity40 ' with this prize we wish to create awareness among the public that space is now also accessible for everyone , ' said @entity32 from @entity33 , who have offered the prize worth around Â£ 100,000			2
' journeys into space can be made starting from the end of 2015			0
we already have 300 bookings			0
' among those hoping to win the prize this week in @entity54 , which is just outside @entity55 , include former @entity9 champions @entity56 and @entity58 , @entity60 's @entity59 , home favourite @entity61 , and @entity63			1
blast off : former open champion @entity56 is among those competing for the prize this week but whether the colourful @entity67 could stomach tubed space food rather than his beloved rioja wine is doubtful			2
the @entity9 winner may not quite join that illustrious list of stars in the golfing firmament - but the first man to shoot a hole - in - one will be blasting off , rather than teeing off , sometime in the near future .			1

golfers at the @entity9 this week have chance to win unique prize
first player to shoot a hole - in - one on the 15th wins a trip into space
