by @entity0 published : 08:44 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 20:53 est , 28 october 2013 a wife watched in horror as her husband died from an allergic reaction to an ingredient in her homemade curry			2
@entity8 , 46 , returned from work to find his wife @entity10 preparing their evening meal , but after she gave him a small amount of the coconut cream she was using he began complaining of a sore throat , an inquest heard			1
mrs @entity16 , 49 , who had a daughter with her late husband , told the coroner : ‘ he was looking a little bit clammy and a bit different			2
tragic : @entity8 , 46 , here with his wife , @entity10 and daughter @entity23 , had an immediate reaction devastated : @entity10 , the wife of @entity8 , 46 , told @entity26 he had eaten coconut before without reacting			1
but he collapsed when she gave him some coconut cream at their home in @entity31 ' i told him he was starting to scare me			2
he said his throat was really sore and asked me to take him to hospital			2
i called an ambulance immediately			0
’ fatal : mr @entity8 , a cleaning supervisor , was feeling fine when he came home from work earlier that day but despite a paramedic arriving at their home in @entity41 , near @entity31 , within just four minutes , mr @entity8 suffered a cardiac arrest and died			1
his family accused @entity44 , the first paramedic to attend , of failing to act to save mr @entity8 ’s life during the incident in november 2011 , claiming that he ‘ just sat there ’			1
the paramedic admitted to the coroner : ‘ this was possibly one of the worst incidents i have ever attended in my 30 years of work			1
‘ i think i was a bit like a rabbit in headlights			0
it was stretching the boundaries of my experience			0
’ the inquest at @entity26 , near @entity31 , heard that when mr @entity44 realised that mr @entity8 was having a reaction to the coconut cream , he treated it with an antihistamine injection			1
but minutes later , mr @entity8 went into anaphylactic shock – a potentially fatal extreme allergic reaction – clutching his throat and saying he could not breathe			1
mrs @entity16 said : ‘ all of a sudden he just bolted upright , like a meerkat , and began to say he while reactions to coconuts are relatively rare , an allergy to products derived from the tree nut is more common			0
the reasons behind this vary from person to person			0
often , it is a case of cross-reactivity			0
that means the person is sensitive to a property present in a number of foods - coconut , milk , and duck eggs - that is highly concentrated when combined , for example in cream			0
in other cases , the person is in fact reacting to a chemical in the product , not the coconut itself			0
he made a horrible noise with his breathing , like a death rattle			0
‘ he was turning blue and his face had swollen and his tongue was sticking out			0
i did n’t think he was going to recover			0
i looked at @entity44 and just thought , “ do something , for goodness sakes do something ”			1
’ the inquest heard that mr @entity8 had eaten coconut before but had not previously tried coconut cream			1
mr @entity8 ’s mother - in - law , @entity110 , who also witnessed the death , told the inquest : ‘ it was clear that @entity8 wanted the paramedic ’s help , but the paramedic was by the window with his back to him			1
it looked like he was ignoring him			0
‘ @entity8 did n’t look a good colour			2
he was clearly very , very unwell			0
’ the inquest heard that mr @entity8 then fell off the sofa and went into a cardiac arrest			1
a short while later , another ambulance crew arrived who assisted mr @entity44 with @entity128 , but after half an hour they pronounced mr @entity8 dead			1
the inquest was also told that mr @entity8 suffered from an undiagnosed heart condition which may have been a contributory factor in his death			1
recording a narrative verdict , which sets out the facts without attributing blame , coroner @entity132 said : ‘ @entity8 suffered an allergic reaction			2
paramedics were called , but despite treatment he died			2
’ mrs @entity16 yesterday criticised paramedic mr @entity44 , claiming he had ‘ no sense of urgency at all ’			1
she added : ‘ i find it deeply worrying that he admitted he was out of his depth			0
