by @entity0 last updated at 12:25 am on 15th november 2011 secret stockpiles of chemical weapons have been found in @entity3 – revealing @entity4 duped @entity5 when he promised to give them up			1
@entity7 said last night that the new @entity3 government had told him it had identified an arsenal that had been ‘ kept hidden from the world ’			1
diplomatic sources said several sites thought to contain mustard gas agent and other chemicals had been discovered across the country and were now under armed guard			1
cosying up : @entity5 with @entity4 in 2007			0
the pair forged close links if confirmed by international inspectors , the discovery will mean that @entity21 was mistaken when it cosied up to the @entity3 regime on the understanding that it had given up its weapons of mass destruction			1
closer ties between the countries were agreed when mr @entity5 shook hands with @entity4 in a tent outside @entity30 in the ‘ deal in the desert ’ in 2004			0
mr @entity5 insisted at the weekend that he was not embarrassed to have forged links with @entity4			0
he said : ‘ we were used to him being a threat , sponsoring terrorism			0
he was developing a nuclear and chemical programme			0
he gave it all up			0
' but last night mr @entity7 , at the annual @entity40 in @entity41 , said : ‘ although @entity4 agreed to declare and dismantle all his weapons of mass destruction … in the last few days , we have learned that the new @entity3 authorities have found chemical weapons that were kept hidden from the world			1
’ stockpile : a part of @entity4 's arsenal discovered in @entity30			1
the former @entity3 leader had been ' lying to the world ' broken promises : when @entity3 joined the @entity54 in 2004 , it was obliged to declare all its chemical warfare materials and destroy them this has prompted serious security concerns given the political instability in @entity3 following @entity4 ’s downfall			1
@entity21 is thought to be observing the sites closely using satellite technology			1
a source said : ‘ it seems @entity4 had been lying to the world about what he had and what he was doing with it			2
this is stuff that @entity4 did not declare			0
‘ we are still waiting for confirmation about exactly what it is , but @entity4 ’s interest was in mustard gas			1
what we have said to the @entity75 [ @entity3 ’s @entity75 ] is that it is critically important that this material is not moved , and that it is kept secure			1
’ when @entity3 joined the @entity54 in 2004 , it was obliged to declare all its chemical warfare materials and destroy them by internationally agreed deadlines			1
hidden : @entity7 said the new @entity3 government had found an arsenal @entity4 declared 25 tonnes of bulk mustard agent and 1,400 tonnes of ‘ precursor chemicals ’ which are used to make chemical weapons			1
he also declared more than 3,500 unfilled aerial bombs designed for use with chemical warfare agents such as sulphur mustard , and three chemical weapons production facilities			0
by february this year , @entity3 said it had destroyed 55 per cent of its declared stockpile of sulphur mustard			1
the @entity92 has already deployed an inspection team to @entity3 to evaluate the status of chemical weapons stored at the @entity97 depot in the south - east of the country			1
but the new @entity3 authorities have advised the @entity92 that ‘ further stocks ’ have been found			2
a spokesman for the @entity92 said : ‘ in accordance with the @entity54 , @entity3 will provide the @entity92 with a new declaration in the very near future			2
the @entity92 will continue to work with the @entity3 authorities to verify and destroy any newly declared stocks			2
’ in last night ’s speech , mr @entity7 rounded on critics who suggested @entity21 ’s mission in @entity3 would ‘ only end in failure ’			2
‘ some said we could n’t win because they said @entity21 did n’t have the military might any more , ’ he said			0
‘ well , to those who predicted failure , look at what we have achieved			0
‘ we saved civilian lives as @entity4 ’s tanks bore down on @entity119			0
we helped the @entity3 people to liberate themselves			2
i would argue that our action helped keep the @entity122 alive			0
some will look at @entity3 and ask “ is this a new @entity21 doctrine for intervention ? next time , will we just charge in regardless ? ” ‘ my answer is “ no. ” look at the reasons for the success of the @entity3 campaign			2
we set limited goals and stuck to them			0
we had the support of the people			0
