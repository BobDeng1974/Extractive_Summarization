by @entity0 plans to extend a riverside hotel in historic @entity3 have been rejected for a third time - following a campaign spearheaded by @entity5			1
the @entity6 by @entity7 had its plans to build 31 extra bedrooms and a new leisure centre rejected last year , following a similar idea turned down in 2010			1
the latest scheme for the hotel , which sits on @entity14 and @entity14 by the @entity15 in @entity3 , involved building a fourth floor to one block , providing 16 new rooms			1
prof @entity5 , pictured , campaigned against the proposed hotel extension in @entity3 developers wanted to extend the hotel by an additional 31 bedrooms to the @entity22 , pictured however , planners rejected the expansion plans , which campaigners claimed would , according to this artist 's impression would reduce the amount of river frontage available to members of the public @entity32 , which owns the @entity33 , said they planned to then convert the hotel 's leisure centre into 13 bedrooms , while retaining a small gym			1
but it has already been recommended by planning officers at @entity40 that the plans should be rejected			0
members of the public voiced concerns about the potential loss of leisure facilities , commenting these are ' well used ' and that the new design is ' unattractive '			0
campaigners including the @entity50 author and comedian @entity48 argued that a new build would ruin the historic view of @entity53			1
cllr @entity54 said : ' i am delighted this application is being recommended for refusal by council officers			0
the loss of the leisure club would be a loss for the community			0
' @entity62 , chairman of the @entity64 's @entity63 which led the campaign against the first two applications , said she was absolutely ' delighted '			2
she said : ' there are so many grounds for refusal , including taking away the leisure centre from over 700 @entity3 residents			1
' damage is being done to a particularly unique and beautiful area of @entity3			1
' thirty - seven mothers who take their children to swim in the pool signed a petition against the move			0
protesters were able to defeat a third planning application despite developers altering their designs but designer @entity83 , of @entity85 - based @entity84 , said at the time the proposals would have no impact on views from @entity14 and @entity14 - a key issue in previous refusals			2
he said : ' we have endeavoured to take on board the previous comments made by both the committee and the appeal officer and we have looked to address them in a constructive and sensitive fashion with revised proposals			0
' the proposals would also get rid of a large and visually prominent glazed pyramid for a transition to a single storey structure - something which @entity103 welcomed			0
when it launched its third application , the hotel argued removing the leisure centre 's pyramidal roof would help the development to blend in			2
hotel officials said the expansion was needed because it was running at ' maximum capacity ' - but the plan was rejected anyway			2
owners of the @entity114 said they need the extension as they are ' running at maximum capacity			0
