@entity1 host rivals @entity0 on sunday as both teams look to take another step towards securing a place in next season 's @entity5			1
here , @entity7 takes a look at three of the key battles which could decide the game at @entity11			2
@entity14 v @entity12 the 6ft 4in @entity12 has given @entity0 a new dimension in recent weeks and has looked a better strike partner for @entity17 than either @entity18 or @entity19			1
but if you needed the perfect warrior centre - half to combat @entity12 , @entity14 would be high on your list			2
the shaven - headed stopper is fearless and as hard as nails			0
he knocked himself out making a challenge in an @entity28 tie against @entity29 earlier this month			0
@entity14 ( left ) will need to deal with @entity12 's ( right ) height and physical presence on sunday @entity32 vs @entity33 different type of midfield players but whoever gets the upper hand could have a decisive influence on the result			1
@entity32 is all about energy and mobility and scored the winner at @entity43 on monday night			1
@entity33 ’s range of passing is outstanding , he gets the other @entity0 players on the ball at the right time			0
both are vice-captains of their club and rivals in @entity54 ’s @entity53 squad too			0
@entity32 ( left ) and @entity33 both play in the centre of midfield but they have different styles @entity58 vs @entity59 both players were tipped at one time to be the future of @entity63 football and are on the way back after injury			1
if @entity58 ’s stealth and trickery win out , @entity1 will fancy their chances			2
but @entity59 is strong and will try to outmuscle the striker			0
both have been named by @entity53 in the squad to face @entity72 and @entity73 and will be keen to show they are back to their best			0
@entity58 ( left ) will be looking to bamboozle @entity59 ( right ) with his pace and trickery at @entity11			1

@entity12 is likely to start in an advanced role for the *visitors*
@entity32 has impressed with his energy and mobility
@entity59 will have to cope with @entity58 's pace and *movement*
