sss - sensational : a family of meerkats in @entity18 pulled together to save their newborn pups from a deadly snake the meerkats , which are renown for living in tight - knit family groups , were forced to rally round and drag the babies from the burrow out of danger despite a serious injury to her leg the female continued to help and eventually carried all five pups to safety			1
photographer @entity29 from @entity30 captured the commotion on camera			0
mr @entity29 was working as a research assistant at the @entity34 in @entity18 at the time and said the event summed up the strength and determination of meerkats			1
@entity29 said : ' meerkat pups stay underground and do n't emerge for up to three weeks until their eyes have opened and they are able to react to their environment a little			2
teamwork : the whole meerkat family helped save the tiny pups adorable : the meerkat pups look dazed after being dragged away from the snake deadly : the puff adder lurks in the meerkat 's burrow ' during this time the group generally leave up to three individuals to babysit at the burrow			1
' on this particular morning i arrived at the burrow and sat down to wait , and waited , and waited			2
' about three hours after the usual time for this group to be up , the sunrise had long gone and it was starting to get hot when i heard noises coming from the burrow			2
' suddenly the group emerged			0
usually a group gets up casually one by one and they sit about at the entrance for a while to warm up before leaving but this time was different			0
' it was a frenzy of meerkats coming up from different holes and popping back down again			0
after about 10 minutes of this activity i spotted a slightly purplish lump in the middle of the frenzy			0
brave : despite having suffered a snake bite , the dominant female carries the babies to safety remarkable sight : the drama was watched by photographer @entity29 from @entity30 rescued : the pups were transported to another burrow about 300 metres away ' at first i thought it was dead but i saw it try to raise its head			1
in the next 20 minutes they brought up two more pups and then another two , so five in total			2
' the action was frantic but luckily i had my camera so i was snapping away trying to capture what was going on			0
' at some point i noticed the dominant females leg was badly swollen and bleeding			0
due to the swelling i predicted that it was a snake bite and sure enough when i managed to get a glimpse down the burrow i saw the head of a rather angry puff adder			1
' the group at that time had four juveniles which were almost sub-adults who were all obviously very excited by everything that was going on and kept trying to pick up the pups which they could only just lift , moving them a couple of metres and running back to the burrow			1
' this carried on for quite some time			0
eventually the dominant female picked up one of the pups and made for the next nearest burrow , probably about 300 metres away			1
' she eventually managed to carry all five pups to the next burrow almost by herself with a now massively swollen front leg			2
all the pups survived their ordeal and so did the dominant female			0
' looking back , it was up there with the top wildlife experiences i had in the past year as a meerkat research assistant			0
' it was amazing to witness the strength and determination of that dominant female and i 'm glad i took my camera out that day			0
