by @entity0 in 2012 and 2013 @entity2 - born photographer @entity1 was granted unparalleled access to the @entity4 ( @entity4 )			1
for those two years he photographed 20 classified facilities belonging to @entity4 across @entity6 , from the @entity7 to @entity8 to @entity9			1
and now he ’s revealed the stunning photography he took , which includes space simulators and launch sites , in a new art exhibit opening tomorrow			1
photographer @entity1 has revealed the images he took inside @entity4 after being given unparalleled access for two years			1
pictured is the sight up from the bottom of the 50 - metre ( 165 feet ) tall mobile launch gantry for @entity4 's @entity21 in @entity22			2
when preparation is complete , the 1,000 tonne gantry rolls back on rails , leaving the @entity21 rocket on the pad ready for launch known as the rehearsal of @entity31 and the @entity32 to manage the @entity33 , the collection will be on display at the @entity35 in @entity36 from friday 25 april to 29 may			1
the photographs were shot in long exposures of up to one hour using a 10x8 inch , large format camera			0
the locales include test centres , robotics departments , space simulators , laboratories , launch sites , astronaut training centres and satellite assembly rooms			0
‘ whilst the visions that inspired the space age were drawn from artists and writers , in more recent times the gulf between the space community and arts world drifted apart , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ so in 2012 i presented the @entity4 a very ambitious proposal : to produce the most comprehensive survey ever assembled about a leading scientific and space exploration organisation and its programs			1
‘ i explained my intention to critically engage with @entity4 and its partner ’s programs , such as the telecommunication , navigation , integrated biological life support system for space applications , microgravity , human spaceflight , lunar and @entity72 exploration programs , whilst also reflecting on the new politics of space exploration as well as the impact of this kind of technological application on our social , cultural and existential consciousness			1
in this image @entity2 - born @entity1 has show the exterior of a node 2 mock - up at the @entity85 centre in @entity4 's scientific and technical heart at @entity87 in @entity88 , the @entity89			1
node 2 is a @entity92 - built module of the @entity93 ( @entity93 ) that was installed in 2007 this is the interior of the @entity95 ( @entity95 ) @entity96 at @entity87 , @entity97			0
at 15 metres ( 50 feet ) high and 10 metres ( 33 feet ) wide , the @entity95 is the largest vacuum chamber in @entity6 and is used to test full - size spacecraft in representative space conditions pictured is the interior of the @entity103 , at @entity104 in @entity105 , @entity8			0
the is a full - sized mock - up of the @entity108 module on the @entity93 pictured is a space glove once worn by a cosmonaut at the @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114 ‘ i was also interested in reflecting on the impact of imagery of space exploration on popular culture and our psyche and how this might also impact the work i would produce			1
’ ‘ on and on i had hoped this project would promote a dialogue between space exploration , science , contemporary photographic art and the wider public			1
‘ i am interested in the techniques of artistic expression these engagements can activate , and in the dialogue that these projects and envrionments can provoke			0
the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) was established in 1975			2
it is composed of 20 @entity92 states			0
its headquarters are in @entity138 , @entity139 while its primary spaceport is the @entity141 near @entity142 in @entity22			0
in 2013 the total budget for @entity4 was € 4.28 billion ( £ 3.64 billion ; $ 5.51 billion ) among @entity4 ’s flagship missions it is involved in the @entity93 in september with its @entity148 mission it will also become the first agency to land on a comet ‘ so i was extremely pleased when they agreed to support my endeavour			2
‘ it seems i had contacted @entity4 at crucial time in their history , when they have recognised the importance to mantain a coherent dialogue with the general public and hopefully now also the arts			2
’ @entity1 says his project is the first time in the history of @entity4 that an artist has been granted exclusive access to all of their facilities			1
he was also given full access to staff , their programmes and technology at the space agency			2
even for other large institutions such as @entity178 or @entity179 , such access is unprecedented			0
from his time on the sites , @entity1 says the things that most struck a cord were the complexity of operations			0
‘ @entity4 is unique in that it is a multinational , “ world ” space agency , ’ he says			2
‘ although my way of working is more akin to a scientist or an archaeologist than it is a photographer , witnessing “ space time ” in motion is a humbling experience			0
’ he also says that he was able to read astronaut ’s mission notebooks , exchange stories with them and get ‘ an insight into an astronaut ’s life in space			0
’ here you can see the cleanliness of a fuelling hall where spacecraft are filled with propellant before launch - the @entity211 payload preparation complex at @entity6 's @entity212 in @entity142 , @entity22 this is an ' @entity214 ' ( @entity22 for fuel ) helmet photographed in @entity142 , part of the protective wear for people handling spacecraft fuel			0
they are specially designed to ensure protection during use and manipulation of special products like fuel for satellites and rockets @entity1 says he was given unprecedented access to staff , programmes and facilities at @entity4			1
here is seen the @entity234 at the @entity235 in @entity236 , @entity8 this photo shows some of the equipment in the astronaut dressing room in the @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114			0
all of the images shown here are part of @entity1 ' project @entity244 of @entity31 and the @entity245 to manage the @entity33 , which is on display at the @entity35 in @entity36 , from friday 25 april to 29 may , and will also be released in a book of the same name in may 2014 but @entity1 adds that he hopes his project will remind the public how important space exploration is to the development of science , technology , engineering , education and medicine			1
‘ i was able to photograph a myriad of technology which will have similar applications in the future			0
‘ although the framework of space exploration has traditionally been tied with national security and the political aspirations of states , today , budget cuts in an era of worldwide economic downturn has opened the doors to the commercialization and privatisation of space			1
‘ however , i 'm pleased to say that there is a continued focus on more exploratory programs , allowing us to peer further into deep space and to better understand our surroundings and humanity ’s origins			0
‘ there are new and exciting programs being developed at present and i have no doubt that we are entering a new golden era of space exploration			1
‘ we are slowly getting a new picture of the @entity287 that is pushing the limits of understanding current cosmological theories , making the confluence of the infinitely large and the infinitely small an ever more viable proposition			0
’ but , he concludes , ‘ for all the advancements in technology and robotics , space exploration is still inherently dependent on the individual			2

photographer @entity1 has unveiled his unprecedented photography of @entity4 facilities and programmes
he was granted unparalleled access to the agency for two years in order to create this collection of imagery
from tomorrow the entire *86* photos of his project will be on display at the @entity35 in @entity36
the rehearsal of @entity31 to manage the @entity33 exhibit will run until the end of may
@entity1 says his unprecedented photos show we are entering a ' golden era of space exploration '
