they may have been hand - written scrawls , but school reports could once be relied on for a blunt assessment of a pupil ’s progress			2
now it has emerged that thousands of primary and secondary school teachers are relying on computer software to do the work for them			1
the software , which costs up to £ 350 , allows them to produce reports in seconds by simply giving the child ’s name and ability , then clicking on bland stock phrases			1
worrying : are parents being short - changed by computer generated reports ? one software package , @entity21 , is used in just under 300 primary schools in the @entity23			1
the company says about 3,000 teachers are using it			2
all they have to do is cut and paste the names of their pupils into a blank box			0
the software , designed by an ex-teacher , even guesses the gender of the child , based on their names			2
they then get access to 15,000 frequently used comments			0
for example , if a child is of higher ability , the demo shows the report would read that he or she ‘ enjoys all aspects of art and is able to put excellent imagination and attention to detail to good use			2
’ middle or lower ability children would get remarks such as : ‘ @entity54 enjoys all aspects of art and is able to produce some good paintings and drawings			1
in order to perfect these he needs to pay closer attention to detail and take more care with work			0
’ up to half of children in some areas of the country failed to get into their preferred secondary school yesterday			2
tens of thousands of 11 - year - olds missed out on their top choices as the best state schools received more than 1,000 applications each			0
in some areas , hundreds of pupils did not get into any of the six schools on their application forms and will be forced to travel to less popular comprehensives			0
council data shows the rejection rate is driven by competition for the best grammar schools and a new generation of academies and free schools			0
experts believe an exodus of cash - strapped middle - class parents from the private sector is also fuelling demand			0
in @entity92 – a grammar school region – 45.8 per cent of pupils failed get their first - choice secondary			0
in @entity96 per cent of children in @entity98 and 43 per cent in @entity99 did not get their favoured secondary school			0
across the capital the figure was 29.4 per cent on average			0
@entity104 , of the @entity105 , said : ‘ competition for places at the most popular state schools is at fever pitch			1
‘ increasing numbers of parents who would in rosier times have sent their children private are now joining the throngs			0
’ @entity21 costs £ 99 plus vat to help write reports for up to 100 pupils and £ 299 plus vat for an unlimited number of students			1
one deputy head said it meant she and her colleagues did n’t have to ‘ spend all weekend ’ writing reports			1
another wrote in an online review : ‘ while my colleagues speak of being up at 2am writing reports , mine took just over three hours to sort out , not 33 hours ! ’ but critics described it as ‘ lazy ’ and said parents were being ‘ short - changed			1
’ professor @entity131 , director of the @entity132 at @entity133 , said : ‘ this is a very lazy way of writing reports			1
‘ the schools are educating the children on behalf of the parents and have a duty to inform them			2
i know , where a teacher has a lot of pupils , it ’s a bit of a chore			0
‘ but it ’s his or her responsibility to provide detailed , personal information to the parent – not just summon up these general phrases			0
‘ parents have a right to receive particular information about their child , not computer generated generalisations			0
’ another software package , called @entity158 , is designed so that all teachers have to do is type in ‘ l ’ for lower achiever , ‘ m ’ for medium achiever or ‘ h ’ for high achiever			1
they are then offered a selection of suitable stock remarks to choose from			0
it claims the system ‘ conforms fully with the expectation of @entity170 , your local authority , head teachers and parents ’			1
@entity176 , general secretary of the @entity177 , denied it was a ‘ lazy ’ way to write reports			1
‘ it would be if everyone was getting the same reports , but that ’s not the case with the software now , ’ he said			1
mr @entity176 said that the ‘ vast majority ’ of secondary schools also use report writing software , for example @entity188 from @entity189			1
@entity189 ’s website estimates the software saves teachers 30 minutes per report			2
old school : teachers are now turning their back on manually - written reports for a computer generated version ( posed by model )			2

software , which costs up to £ 350 , writes reports in seconds
one package , @entity21 , used in just under 300 primary schools in the @entity23
teachers say it means they do *n't* have to ‘ spend all weekend ’ writing reports
