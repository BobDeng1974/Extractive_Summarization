tv star @entity0 , 54 , said woman ' want to look fantastic ' forget thongs and frills , for when it comes to fashion the woman over 50 would far rather hang on to her jeans than fancy lingerie			1
comfort rather than style appears to the mantra of the nation ’s mature women , who feel high street chains are ignoring them			1
in fact , women over 50 are emerging as @entity15 ’s most powerful consumer group and they are a hugely lucrative market for the fashion industry with annual sales worth some £ 6.7billion			1
yet a new study says that too often designers and retailers fail to understand them and what they want from clothes			0
the research , commissioned by retailer @entity27 , found that just 20per cent of mature women feel well catered for on the high street and 61per cent feel that their age group is forgotten			1
around one in three said they felt pressured by the big chains to dress younger than their years			1
and when they were asked about their favourite piece of clothing , a pair of jeans came out top with 15per cent putting it at number one , while just one per cent named lingerie			1
this might have something to do with the comfort offered by a well cut pair of jeans , for the study found 71per cent rate comfort over style when it comes to fashion			2
researchers asked older women which parts of their body they felt most negative about and wanted help with			2
@entity59 was the stomach at 64per cent , ahead of the upper arms at 35per cent and thighs at 28per cent			2
given these findings , it is not surprising that some 57per cent of the women questioned said they would like to lose weight			2
the study said : ‘ fifty - three per cent of women aged 50 + feel that it can be hard to find clothing that suits them , with 22per cent saying they would like to buy more fashionable clothes but find clothes shopping intimidating			1
‘ sixty - six per cent of mature women feel they would like to see more choice from fashion retailers suited to their age group			1
’ @entity27 has commissioned daytime tv star @entity0 to create her own collection next year			1
earlier this year , she fronted a fashion campaign for the retailer			0
jeans , like this pair by @entity84 , were named the favourite piece of clothing by women over 50 the 54 - year - old said : ‘ these women have the spending power and they want to look fantastic , it does n’t matter what size or age they are , we have neglected them			1
i know this from my own experience			0
’ she said she knows many women her age who have struggled to find clothes that flatter a slightly older figure while remaining stylish			0
‘ @entity103 is all about feeling comfortable in your own skin and all of the clothes that i ’ve chosen make me feel great , ’ she said			0
the study also asked older women about the advantages and challenges of growing old			0
some 22per cent said they were excited about getting a bus pass , which ranked slightly higher than a pension			0
they were looking forward to more leisure time , having grandchildren and spending time with friends and family			0
just 10per cent were worried about getting wrinkles , while 77per cent have ruled out any form of plastic surgery			0
@entity127 , the 52 - year - old chief executive of @entity128 , which owns @entity27 , said : ‘ shopping for clothes should be easy and enjoyable whether you ’re 16 or 60			0
‘ there are more women in the 50 + bracket than ever before and it ’s abundantly clear that they have felt let down by the fashion industry			1
‘ recent years have seen this population of women emerge as the most powerful consumer group and the fastest growing fashion sector			2
no longer does 50 signal the start of the slow decline into old age , it now marks the midpoint of a woman ’s life			0
‘ we hope this report heralds a wake - up call to the fashion , retail and media industries to give these women what they want , in the way we do			2
it ’s our job to empower ; after all ignoring them should be done with peril			0
