by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson most of @entity2 gathered in prayer to help mend @entity5 ’s metatarsal in 2002 - now the whole of @entity7 is willing star striker @entity8 to make his own miracle recovery from injury			1
@entity7 has been waiting for @entity8 ’s knee to improve since he damaged ligaments playing for @entity13 in a @entity15 tie in january			1
a final decision on whether or not he will go to the @entity18 will not be made until sunday , when the team ’s @entity20 coach @entity19 finalises his 23 - man squad			1
it has reminded me how important i am for the country			0
i would n’t say it has put more pressure on me			0
it ’s more a case of an extra motivation - wanting to do things not just for me but for all the people who willed me to get fit			0
‘ the closer the @entity18 gets , the more i am thinking i do n’t want to be just watching in @entity51			1
i have worked hard to make sure that is not going to be the case but with an injury it ’s not just how hard you work , it ’s also how patient and calm you can be			0
’ @entity2 fans will continue to watch his recuperation carefully			1
if @entity7 emerge from @entity59 , which features @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , they could face @entity64 ’s team in the second round			1
comeback trail : @entity8 has stepped up his recovery and trained with the @entity7 squad on wednesday trick shot : @entity8 will be wearing the @entity71 boots in @entity51 it would be a repeat of the @entity75 group game when @entity76 ’s @entity2 brushed aside one of @entity7 ’s best - ever teams in the @entity79 in @entity80			1
‘ i remember watching the @entity2 game with my dad , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ @entity83 scored and @entity5 scored with a free - kick and we were going home early again			1
‘ we have paid the price in the past for not being as advanced in many areas of the game as other countries			0
that has left us poorly prepared for big tournaments but now , with so many @entity96 players playing in big clubs all over the world , that has changed			2
we have improved our mentality			0
’ memory : @entity8 remembers watching @entity5 score against @entity7 at @entity18 ' 98 with his @entity102 if his knee stays strong , @entity8 could benefit from being sidelined for so long			1
‘ i do n’t come into the tournament with the weight of a long season in my legs so that could be an advantage , ’ he said			0
‘ providing my knee is fine , the rest of me is well rested and fresh			0
’ back of the net : @entity8 celebrates scoring a penalty against @entity113 during @entity18 qualifying to get out of the group @entity7 may have to get past the @entity62 and one of @entity8 ’s striking references , @entity116			1
‘ it ’s no surprise that he is still there at the top , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ if you are as professional as he has always been and you look after yourself you extend your career at the top			0
‘ we have a real chance in this group because it ’s even			0
’ not that @entity8 believes @entity7 merit their shorter odds than @entity2 going into the tournament			1
‘ you underestimate yourselves , ’ he said			0
‘ i see @entity2 as favourites with @entity133 and @entity134 in terms of the @entity137 contenders and obviously @entity20 and @entity51 from @entity39			1
i would put @entity2 ahead of ourselves in terms of favourites			2
‘ you have one of the best leagues in the world and it ’s extremely competitive , so the players who play in it are elite players			2
maybe they would benefit from a little emigration as well , to experience other leagues			0
’ @entity8 shunned the @entity148 for a lucrative contract at @entity13 last summer , but the 28 - year - old says he will end up in @entity2 one day			1
‘ i hope to be playing for many more years in @entity137 and i want to play in the @entity152 league at some time , ’ he said			1
‘ i watch the @entity148 and i see how competitive it is and how teams are very direct in terms of looking for the opposition ’s goal			0
the football is very physical ; it ’s a very interesting league			0
’ big - money move : @entity8 , who joined @entity13 for £ 51m , says he will end up playing in @entity2 one day time will tell if it is attractive enough to tempt @entity8 ; next season he will be playing for @entity13 in the @entity33			1
‘ it is very important to be playing in this competition			2
i know that people want to see me competing in the @entity33 , ’ he said			2
he also understands why people questioned his decision last year to move to a club who average crowds of under 15,000			2
he scored 52 goals in 67 games for @entity173 but justifies the switch to @entity13 , saying : ‘ everyone decides what he wants for his own life			1
everyone has to do what they think is best for them			0
when you are a professional sportsman you always want to win regardless			2
’ there must have been some regret at witnessing @entity173 enjoy such a superb season			2
no regrets : @entity8 says he was overjoyed to see former club @entity173 win @entity187 and reach the @entity33 final this season ‘ i ’m a little bit surprised at just how well they played and i ’m overjoyed at what they have achieved , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity192 had an incredible season			0
he was decisive when he needed to be in the league			0
people say we are similar because we played the same position in the same team but they forget we also played together last season			0
he can play wide when necessary			2
he prefers to go out wide to look for space , i prefer to stay central			0
’ @entity192 looks set to move to @entity202 if @entity203 does not act on his long - standing admiration for @entity8 , who believes the magic will remain at @entity173 as long as @entity206 stays			1
he was coached first at @entity207 and then at @entity173 by the manager who @entity209 neglected to put in their top 10 coaches last season			2
‘ i think they forgot him , ’ said @entity8			2
‘ he is one of those coaches who has everything			0
he knows how to motivate players but it ’s a lot more than that			0
people think it ’s all inspiration but there is an awful lot of work done , too			0
he knows how to analyse the games and he knows where to take advantage of the opposition ’s weakness			0
’ @entity8 will play in the @entity230 boot at the @entity18			1
it 's been a while since we 've seen @entity7			1
where have they been ? after success in the 1990s with midfielder @entity237 and his wonderful hair , @entity7 have failed to reach the last three @entity239			1
they have a colourful past ... @entity7 were highly fancied for the 1994 @entity18 but finished bottom of their group @entity244 ’s own goal			1
