accident victim @entity0 warning : @entity1 one lazy sunday morning back in july , @entity0 slipped while climbing out of the bath - landing teeth - first on the bath rim			1
' i did n't have time to put a hand in front of my face , ' she recalls			2
the fall smashed one of @entity0 's bottom teeth into pieces , while a top tooth came out completely			1
three teeth next to it ended up embedded high in her gums			1
@entity0 , 44 , her partner @entity18 and her two children , aged 11 and seven , were staying at her mother 's house in @entity22			1
hearing the crash , @entity18 raced upstairs and hauled her out of the bath			2
' it was n't until i saw his face that i realised it was serious			2
my mouth was full of blood - i could n't string a sentence together , ' recalls @entity0 , who works for a telecommunications group			1
' i was in such a state of shock that i did n't really feel the pain			2
but it was still terrifying			0
' things would only get worse - the ambulance took 40 minutes to arrive , and was turned away from the local @entity38			1
' the doctors said we needed to go a hospital with a specialist clinic , ' she says			0
although there are no official figures on how many people damage their teeth in accidents or assaults in the @entity51 , it 's estimated that hundreds of thousands of people each year have their teeth chipped , broken or pushed out of place			1
a recent audit based on 1,384 patients has revealed there is woeful confusion nationwide over what to do when someone loses a tooth - with nothing like the strict protocols that exist for treating other medical emergencies , such as broken bones			2
this lack of clarity - as well as little specialist training for dentists - is leaving patients in pain and with disfiguring injuries , says @entity73 , a consultant in restorative dentistry , who established the @entity51 's only adult - dedicated dental trauma unit , at @entity76 , @entity77			1
according to the new evidence , which was collected by @entity83 , half of patients who experience some sort of dental trauma remain in severe pain and suffer disabling stress and embarrassment for weeks afterwards			1
the first of these , says miss @entity83 , is never to discard a tooth that 's been knocked out			2
' pick it up - avoiding the root - get rid of any obvious dirt by licking it or running it under water , then put it back in the mouth as close as possible to where it belongs , ' she advises			2
when a tooth is knocked out , the nerves and blood vessels are severed ; the blood supply to the live tooth is cut			2
but delicate cells on the surface of the root of the tooth are capable of re-attaching themselves to the jawbone - as long as they 're not damaged			2
' @entity0 fell on her mouth getting out of bath , sustaining severe dental trauma - but was turned away at @entity38 if putting the tooth back within minutes of the accident is out of the question , putting it in milk will maintain the correct fluid balance in the root , and will help the cells to survive for longer - possibly up to six hours			1
' a knocked - out permanent tooth is one of the few real emergency situations in dentistry , ' says dr @entity132 , consultant in paediatric dentistry at @entity134			2
' the public needs to be made aware of how to proceed immediately following these unexpected injuries			0
' next week , miss @entity83 will launch a charity called @entity138 , which aims to ensure everyone knows what to do if they lose a tooth			1
its slogan is : ' pick it , lick it and stick it			1
' ' putting a tooth back in the gum could save the tooth , ' she says			2
' if bystanders , paramedics and doctors at @entity38 all know how important this is , it could mean that far more teeth are saved			1
' the charity will also begin a major educational programme for dentists - with extra training , online material and an accreditation programme , so people can check that their local dentist has the expertise to treat dental trauma			1
' the urgent care patients need can only be provided by local dentists , ' says miss @entity83			0
' while all undergraduate dentists learn about reimplantation and managing dental trauma , they 'll get no more than a single lecture on the subject			1
the vast majority will never see a case involving a knocked - out tooth during their training			2
' indeed , research led by @entity181 has shown that out of 200 children treated at five dental clinics after a tooth had been knocked out , only 25 were re-implanted			1
' children are advised not to have implants until their jaw is fully formed , which normally happens by age 18			0
without a tooth or implant in place , the bone in the jaw begins to deteriorate - with a permanent impact on their dental health , ' he adds			1
her partner @entity18 knew from his rugby - playing days that a knocked - out tooth was worth saving			2
@entity0 says : ' i saw it in the bath and was going to throw it away			1
but @entity18 took it downstairs and put it in a glass of milk , which he brought along to the hospital			0
' i was still too shocked to ask what on earth he was doing			0
' after being turned away by @entity38 , @entity18 drove @entity0 to the maxillofacial clinic at @entity214 , 20 miles away , where doctors put the tooth back in her mouth - fixing it in place with a splint			1
' i never for a moment thought the tooth would re-root			0
if @entity18 had not been so quick - thinking , i 'd have had to live with a missing tooth or spend £ 2,000 on an implant			0
' she was treated at @entity226 where the adult dental trauma unit is best in country the expense of dental work is n't the only consideration			1
' once a real tooth takes root , it has the same chance of surviving for longer than an implant , ' says miss @entity83			0
she also advises patients to keep a decent photograph of their smile			0
' a selfie will do perfectly , ' she says			0
this is so knocked - out teeth can be reimplanted in the right position			0
' an x-ray can provide this information - but only if the tooth is still straight and the damage is relatively minor , ' she explains			0
@entity0 was referred to the dental trauma service at @entity76 24 hours after her accident - and was surprised to be asked if she had a selfie			1
' @entity18 had a picture of me on his phone , with my face full - on and with a big smile			0
' it provided all the information the dentists needed			0
that day , @entity0 had five hours of reconstructive surgery			1
the knocked - out tooth was repositioned , the teeth that had been pushed into the gums were pulled back in place and the smashed bottom tooth was replaced with a tooth - coloured filling built up over the original root			1
since then , @entity0 has had regular root - canal work to repair some damaged nerves			1
however , not all patients receive treatment so quickly			0
when @entity272 , 33 , fractured two top teeth and pushed a third into her lower gum after going over the handlebars of her bike this summer , it took nearly a fortnight to get the emergency treatment she needed			0
@entity272 , a strategic consultant who lives in @entity77 , was told by her local @entity38 that as her jaw was not broken , she should see an emergency dentist			1
but after five different consultations over 12 days , @entity272 was still in agony - with one tooth stuck in her gum - and unable to close her mouth			0
@entity0 's mouth after her fall ' i spent £ 1,000 on various investigations and x-rays , as well as having one piece of broken tooth taken out and the nerve underneath it removed , ' she says			1
she was incorrectly told the only way to get the stuck tooth back in place was by wearing a fixed brace for a year - at a cost of £ 18,000			0
finally , one dentist told her about the @entity76 clinic , where the stuck tooth was manoeuvred back into position at the first appointment			0
' in the last four months , i 've had the other teeth restored , and root - canal work to repair the nerves			0
i 'm pretty well back to normal			0
' @entity0 's teeth have also been fully repaired			2
' for several weeks , i was living on shakes and soft food because the teeth felt insecure , even though they were all held in place			0
' now , she feels lucky to have landed on her teeth			0
' anywhere else on my head and i might not have been here , ' she says			0
