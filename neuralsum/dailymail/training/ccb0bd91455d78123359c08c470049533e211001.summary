it may look like a bit of dust on your screen , but this speck is in fact @entity7 â€“ a strange world that could reveal the origin of life on @entity11			1
the image was taken when the @entity14 spacecraft was around 740,000 miles ( 1.2 million km ) from @entity7 , on its way to meet the asteroid			1
@entity14 will be captured into @entity7 ' orbit in march , marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft			1
@entity7 is the bright spot in the centre of the image			2
because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background , the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible			0
the long exposure made @entity7 appear overexposed , and exaggerated its size a cropped , magnified view of @entity7 appears in the inset image at lower left @entity7 , the largest asteroid in the solar system , orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between @entity38 and @entity39			1
' now , finally , we have a spacecraft on the verge of unveiling this mysterious , alien world , ' @entity14 mission director and chief engineer @entity41 , of @entity44 's @entity43 in @entity45 , @entity40 said			2
' soon it will reveal myriad secrets @entity7 has held since the dawn of the solar system			0
' the image was taken as part of a final calibration of the science camera before @entity14 's arrival			2
on december 1 , @entity7 was about nine pixels in diameter - nearly perfect for this calibration			0
@entity14 will be captured into @entity7 ' orbit in march , marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft ( artist 's impression pictured ) @entity7 is 590 miles ( 950 km ) across and was discovered in 1801			1
in january , researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface @entity7 is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt , making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system			1
@entity7 is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a ' dwarf planet '			0
scientists think @entity7 may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere			0
it lies less than three times as far as @entity11 from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform			0
@entity44 's @entity14 has been making its way to @entity7 from the asteroid @entity90 since september 2012			1
it is due to land next year			0
there is high interest in the mission because @entity7 is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice , water , and minerals			2
it provides data on very subtle optical properties of the camera that scientists will use when they analyse and interpret the details of some of the pictures returned from orbit			0
@entity7 is the bright spot in the centre of the image			2
because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background , the camera used a long exposure time to make the stars visible			0
the long exposure made @entity7 appear overexposed , and exaggerated its size ; which was corrected by superimposing a shorter exposure of the dwarf planet in the centre of the image			2
@entity7 is 590 miles ( 950 km ) across and was discovered in 1801			1
in january , researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb ( 6kg ) per second			2
observations by the @entity129 's @entity128 suggested they could be coming from geysers or ice volcanoes			0
@entity7 orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between @entity38 and @entity39 and is very similar to @entity39 's @entity134 and @entity136 's @entity135 - both considered potential sources for harbouring life			1
dr @entity139 , of the @entity129 's lab in @entity141 in @entity142 said : ' although ground and space - based observations may further map the behaviour of @entity7 over its orbit the @entity14 spacecraft mission arriving to orbit @entity7 in early 2015 is expected to be key in providing a long - term follow - up on the water outgassing behaviour of @entity7			1
' the presence and abundance of water in bodies like @entity7 could have relevance for the origin of life on @entity11 and the large - scale migration of planets such as @entity39			1
one scenario suggests as the giant planets migrated they disturbed populations of small rocky and icy asteroids and comets which hit the early @entity11 and @entity168 - delivering organic molecules and water to @entity11			0
the image was taken as part of a final calibration of the science camera before @entity14 's arrival			0
on december 1 , @entity7 was about nine pixels in diameter - nearly perfect for this calibration @entity7 is roughly the size of @entity179 and twice the size of @entity136 's geyser - spouting moon @entity181 which is suspected of having liquid water beneath its surface			1
it lies less than three times as far as @entity11 from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform			0
since launching in 2007 , @entity14 has already visited @entity90 , a giant protoplanet currently located 104 million miles ( 168 million km ) away from @entity7			1
the distance between @entity90 and @entity7 is greater than the distance between the @entity11 and the sun. during its 14 months in orbit around @entity90 , the spacecraft delivered unprecedented scientific insights , including images of its cratered surface and important clues about its geological history			1
@entity90 and @entity7 are the two most massive bodies in the main asteroid belt .			0

the @entity7 asteroid orbits the sun between @entity38 and @entity39 , and may have water gushing from its surface
latest image was taken when the @entity14 spacecraft was around 740,000 miles ( 1.2 million km ) from @entity7
@entity14 is currently *travelling* to meet @entity7 in march where it will *attempt* to understand its geological history
