it is understood that @entity59 on friday began a long - arranged family holiday , despite the very awkward timing given the present circumstances			2
@entity20 questioned whether @entity52 had quit ‘ as a matter of principle against something that is going on ’ and also claimed @entity3 ’s move did not mean his own part in the power struggle was over			1
the @entity75 tycoon ’s offer is thought to be worth between £ 2m - £ 3m , which would see @entity5 into the @entity77			1
there could be future funding to follow that sum			0
however , if successful , @entity3 wants @entity59 out alongside @entity52 and to handpick the two directors who would take their places			2
one source close to @entity3 said : ‘ @entity5 are in serious financial difficulty and require his immediate financial help			2
’ there were also claims he had offered @entity52 the chance to stay on as a consultant but not as part of the board			0

the @entity111 - born businessman is willing to provide cash to keep @entity5 going until their agm , at which point there could be a new share issue			0
that forms the central plank of the plan put forward by the group headed by @entity20 , but it requires the backing of 75 per cent of shareholders to gain a green light			1

the board is in the final stages of reviewing our offer and i expect a definitive answer early next week			2
@entity3 's £ 2m - £ 3m offer would see @entity5 into the @entity77 and there could be future funding to follow that ‘ frankly , it does n’t seem possible that the board can do anything other than recommend it to shareholders given the dire financial circumstances and the fact that no other long - term solution is on offer			1
‘ mr @entity3 ’s involvement ( and recently announced continued commitment ) with @entity37 precludes him from making a similar offer of long - term permanent equity			1

‘ but i know that there are other investors also willing to provide bridging finance			0
the board will therefore not have to accept punitive terms even if @entity3 attempts to oppose them			0
‘ we must remember that the board is ethically and legally bound to act in the best interest of the company and all shareholders			0
@entity3 can not expect preferential treatment and will not get it			0
