the hardware appears to match many of the rumours circulating about the phone , but experts believe the software is instead a skinned version of @entity22 reports claim @entity1 will introduce a new 4.7 - inch @entity4 alongside a larger 5.5 - inch model later this year			1

this was then replaced by the @entity47 at just 5.75mm			0
by comparison , @entity1 ’s current @entity48 has a depth of 7.6mm , while the @entity51 is slightly thinner at 7.5mm			2

@entity71 said the leaked pictures all show flaws - such as buttons that do not fit properly , of misaligned screens			0
