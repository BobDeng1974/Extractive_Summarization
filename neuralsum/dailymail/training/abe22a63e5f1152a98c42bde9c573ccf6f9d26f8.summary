by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 was a healthy 11 - year - old primary school pupil who ‘ loved her food ’			1
but then her family received a letter warning that she was ‘ at risk of being overweight ’ – helping to trigger a near deadly obsession with her body image			1
the once fun - loving schoolgirl became anorexic , and increasingly withdrew from her family as her weight fell to less than four stone			0
now aged 13 she is recovering and yesterday spoke out against the ‘ ridiculous ’ decision to weigh youngsters at school as part of the @entity27			1
a week after she joined her fellow year 6 pupils in stepping on the scales , a letter was sent to her home with graphs attached which said she was at risk of being overweight			1
@entity2 said : ‘ it ’s ludicrous to weigh children at that age because before puberty you get a bit of puppy fat to prepare you for a growth spurt			1
‘ i think that ’s very misleading and potentially very damaging for a child to be warned about their future weight at that time when they already becoming self - conscious about their appearance			0
i really believe it should be stopped			0
’ the @entity51 teenager , who appeared on @entity54 ’s @entity53 programme yesterday , said all the children at her school compared the letters and talked about it in class which only made things worse			1
she said : ‘ i had been a completely happy child but from around this time i started becoming more self - conscious about my body			1
the letter was certainly part of it			2
i am also a perfectionist , which makes you more susceptible to anorexia			0
‘ i started off on a diet and it just progressed from there			0
i started losing weight rapidly			0
’ after being force fed to save her life she spent several months at an adolescent psychiatric unit before being discharged			0
her mother , @entity15 , described it as a ‘ terrifying illness ’ and called for more to be done to stop the obsession with diets and weight			2
she said : ‘ the letter we got was typical of this problem			2
‘ at the time , @entity2 loved her food , she was a healthy little girl going through natural bodily changes			1
speaking on @entity54 's @entity53 , she said : i think as you grow up there are so many pressures and expectations			0
from food , people can almost find a coping mechanism for the pressure ' girl guides will learn about beauty myths and the tricks of ‘ airbrushing ’ amid what has been described as a crisis of self - confidence in young girls			2
guides will spot which magazine pictures have been touched - up and discuss unattainable body traits to win a new ‘ @entity110 ’ badge - as part of a programme to improve flailing self - esteem			1
the new badge will also be open to @entity112 , aged seven to 10 , who will explore how girls are portrayed as princesses			1
@entity116 has teamed up with the @entity118 project , a campaign to promote ‘ real women ’s bodies ’ , to try and boost body confidence in young girls who are feeling the pressure conform to unrealistic ideals			1
a @entity116 survey found 87 per cent of young girls think they are judged more on looks than ability and one in four girls aged between 11 - to - 21 would consider cosmetic surgery			2
one in five girls of primary school age say they have been on a diet and more than a third of teenage girls have skipped meals to try and lose weight			1
chief guide @entity139 , said : ‘ along with @entity116 ’s 100,000 amazing volunteers , i am committed to helping girls develop into happy , self – confident young women – ready to take on the world			1
‘ but they hear all this stuff about how “ you are going to be obese ” and it really does n’t help			0
‘ it ’s so important that we stress to teenage girls the simple fact that food is good for you and it keeps you alive			2
‘ one of the shocking things about anorexia is that it ’s a mental illness , not just a physical thing			0
@entity2 went from being a really happy girl to being a shell			1
there is a complete personality change			0
she got to the point where her organs were shutting down			0
she was at risk of dying			2
’ @entity2 also called for more to be done to raise awareness of anorexia in children			1
she said : ‘ i think it ’s really important that schools talk about eating disorders			2
i ’m back at school and i feel so much better about everything so there is hope you can recover			2
‘ my parents supported me but it took a massive toll on everyone and i just hope my story can help others to avoid going through what me and my family did			0
’ hundreds of children have been sent letters informing them they are overweight or obese since the controversial child - measurement programme started in 2006			0
assessments are based on @entity189 – or body mass index – which compares weight and height			0
critics say @entity189 does not account for muscle – so a rugby player could end up classed as obese – and does not account for height and body shape			0
this leads to taller people more often branded overweight as well as girls going through puberty who are developing breasts			1
eating disorder charities have described the letters issued by the @entity27 programme as a ‘ scare tactic ’ that could have damaging effects on vulnerable youngsters			1
but health campaigners say it is vital to help warn parents about the dangers of obesity			0
@entity216 figures show the number of children admitted to hospital with obesity - related conditions has risen four-fold in a decade .			0

@entity2 , now 13 , says the eating disorder nearly killed her
at her lowest , she weighed under 4st and ' lost all her spirit '
mother : was school letter stating a ' risk ' of being overweight to blame ?
@entity2 now gives motivational *speeches* to other girls her age
says she wants girls to be confident and not hate themselves
comes as @entity236 *introduce* a ' body esteem ' badge
