the concept of the entire tv show is built around their boundary pushing and daredevil lives in the outback			0
but when millionaire @entity7 towed his teenage son @entity8 on a wakeboard across a murky river with his helicopter , the @entity6 decided the @entity13 star had gone one step too far			1
now he has won his chopper licence back , with @entity6 declaring he should be allowed to fly again after more training on rules and regulations , the @entity15 reports			0
however , the wakeboarding incident was slammed during an @entity21 , held in @entity22 on 31 october , and other dramatic stunts in the show were embarrassingly unearthed as fake			2
it also demonstrated alarmingly poor judgement			1
’ the @entity40 farmer was initially pulled up by the authority after they spotted a number of worrying incidents on his reality tv series			0
the @entity47 show follows his family ’s life on a cattle station , in @entity51 , 600 km south - west of @entity52 , where they muster cattle and wrestle crocodiles			0
mr @entity7 also owns a scenic flight company called @entity57 , the tourism arm of his @entity60 fleet which has been operating since 1993 with bases from @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity52			2
mr @entity7 appealed against the decision to ban him from flying and during his tribunal @entity34 listed the offences that @entity6 alleged mr @entity7 committed in @entity13			1
when mr @entity7 was alleged to have used a helicopter to harvest crocodile eggs , mr @entity34 said : ‘ the incident was staged			1
there was no crocodile nearby			0
the eggs were placed there before the cameras rolled			0
the @entity40 farmer was initially pulled up by the authority after they spotted a number of worrying incidents on his reality tv series his teenage son @entity8 was also at the centre of the wakeboarding incident ‘ mr @entity7 explained in his evidence that it was the wrong time of year for crocodile egg harvesting , so it was necessary to pretend			2
he justified the role - play for the cameras by saying it accurately represented the way he harvested crocodile eggs			0
’ @entity6 also pulled mr @entity7 up on his low - flying in the show , which they said he needed a special permit for			1
he claimed he did have a permit but he lost it and the tribunal stated ‘ i have no reason to doubt his claim ’			0
however , mr @entity34 pointed out that even if mr @entity7 had a special permit that does n’t mean it was ok for him to tow his son on a wakeboard while flying low			1
‘ there were a number of instances shown in keeping up with the @entity33 where mr @entity7 was shown flying low in circumstances that were plainly unrelated to his agricultural and sling load operations , ’ he said			1
‘ the scene in which he hovered above a watercourse while baiting a bull - shark is one example ; so , too , the scene in which he hovered above a waterhole attempting to snare and tow an enraged crocodile			0
@entity6 pulled mr @entity7 up on his low - flying in the show , which they said he needed a special permit for mr @entity7 said he does have a permit but he has lost it			1
the tribunal said they believed this to be true ‘ even more dramatically , there was a scene in which mr @entity7 flew low over a stretch of water as he raced his brother - in - law on a jet ski , and another scene in which he towed his son @entity8 on a wave board , ’ mr @entity34 said as he ruled mr @entity7 ‘ failed in his duty ’			1
mr @entity7 was also rapped for leaving his helicopter unattended with the engine running and in some cases with his children still in it			1
he argued that to stop the engine was dangerous in remote areas as if it did n’t start again he would become stranded but mr @entity34 pointed out that the cattleman was never alone in the filmed incidences – he had a whole @entity47 film crew with him			2
when it came to a scene in @entity13 where mr @entity7 raced his brother - in - law @entity149 who was on a jet ski , mr @entity34 said : ‘ while i accept the magic of television can affect perception of distance and proximity , it is clear enough from the edited and raw footage i saw that the helicopter was flying substantially under 500 feet during the scene , and at some points as close as tens of feet from the surface			1
’ in keeping up with the @entity33 mr @entity7 raced his brother - in - law @entity149 who was on a jet ski the reality show followed the life of a family on a @entity162 , @entity163 , 600 km south - west of @entity52 he warned that ‘ if something untoward had happened , the aircraft might have impacted the surface			1
that would have had disastrous consequences for @entity149 and perhaps the spectators on the riverbank – and for mr @entity7 himself			2
’ mr @entity34 blasted the stunt and said ‘ there was no margin for error			0
moreover , it was completely unnecessary to run the risk ’			0
@entity176 has contacted mr @entity7 for comment			0
when the @entity178 asked him about the @entity6 investigation in 2011 he said it was a ' witch - hunt '			0
and he described the waterskiing incident as ' a bit of fun ' and ' perfectly safe '			0
mr @entity34 concluded that mr @entity7 contravened the law on several occasions during the production of two series of @entity13			1
but he recommended that if mr @entity7 got the necessary certification before the date on which the suspension is scheduled to come into effect , his licences will not be suspended .			2

millionaire @entity7 was banned from flying by @entity6 in 2011
they alleged he had broken aviation laws while flying his helicopter in keeping up with the @entity33
his case was heard in a tribunal in @entity22 on 31 october
