by @entity0 determined : just like his @entity3 character , @entity1 has cerebral palsy - but that has not stopped him the near - hysterical screams that met actor @entity1 on the red carpet at the @entity9 this year were befitting of a bona fide teenage heart - throb			1
the strikingly handsome 20 - year - old now takes such adulation in his stride , having been a fixture for the past five years in the critically acclaimed @entity17 drama series @entity3 – the nail - biting conclusion of which will be screened next month			1
his nuanced and at times heartbreaking portrayal of a young disabled man , @entity23 , struggling to cope with his father ’s terminal cancer and his own physical problems , has won him unanimous praise			1
however , what marks out @entity1 – real name , @entity30 – is that he has the same disability as his character on screen : cerebral palsy ( @entity35 )			1
the neurological condition normally occurs before or during birth for a number of reasons – usually lack of blood supply and therefore oxygen – meaning parts of the brain die or do not develop			1
the damage leads to , among other things , problems with muscle development , control and movement			1
in @entity3 , @entity50 relies on crutches			1
but , while @entity1 spent his childhood in leg braces – @entity35 causes involuntary muscle contractions that can lead to difficulty in straightening the limbs – his love of sport and exercise means that he now walks unaided			1
a third of those with @entity35 have difficulty with speech , but in a similar way , @entity50 ’s problems are slightly worse than @entity1 ’s			1
the show ’s creator , @entity65 , loosely based the character on a college friend who suffered a more severe form of @entity35 , but had initially been auditioning able - bodied actors			1
after five auditions , @entity1 landed the part			1
‘ it took a little bit of convincing , as at first @entity65 thought i was actually too able - bodied , ’ @entity1 says , explaining how he ‘ regressed ’ to his early days with @entity35 by using crutches again and staying up late so grogginess would thicken his voice			1
‘ playing @entity50 has been an eye - opener to what i ’ve managed to become			1
until i got the role , i never thought what i went through was something odd			1
’ now he does ‘ tons of yoga ’ to fight leg stiffness and takes a prescription drug to relax his muscles			1
‘ if i stopped doing what i ’m doing , it would get worse , ’ says @entity1 ‘ i ca n’t tell you the last time i ’ve gone to a doctor for my @entity35			1
i have it under control for the most part			1
’ at first there was nothing to suggest @entity1 , who was adopted a few weeks after his birth , had problems			1
but by the time he turned three , he had begun showing signs of impairment			1
‘ i had really bad elasticity in my legs , ’ says @entity1 , who grew up in @entity102			1
when he began to walk , he would tip - toe , something commonly seen in @entity35 children due to tightness in the tendons			1
‘ he also had very rigid fingers , ’ his mother @entity109 remembers			1
‘ i had him tested [ for brain impairment ] but he scored really high on all of the tests			1
most cp kids are very intelligent – it ’s a misconception that they are n’t			1
’ when he took on the role as fellow cerebral palsy sufferer @entity118 , son of the main character @entity120 , @entity1 had to learn how to walk on crutches and slur his voice as his own condition is less severe than @entity118 eventually they were given a diagnosis , but faced a further challenge			1
under the terms of @entity1 ’s adoption the identity of his mother was confidential			1
‘ we had to go through a lot of red tape to give us the information the doctors needed , ’ says @entity109			1
‘ we eventually found out @entity1 ’s mother was in labour a long time and finally had to have an emergency caesarean			2
’ when he was delivered , @entity1 was n’t breathing and had to be resuscitated			2
the event left permanent brain damage			2
once his condition was diagnosed , doctors immediately tried to straighten his feet so that he no longer needed to walk on his toes			2
‘ they would bend them into place and put casts on , ’ he says			2
‘ after a week or two , they would cut off the casts , bend my feet more , and then cast them again			2
it was very painful and this went on for six months			2
’ @entity154 also sent her son to speech therapists and tried every exercise that might improve his hand - eye co-ordination , which can sometimes be affected			1
‘ she had me folding 30 or 40 towels and then she ’d knock them over and i would fold them again , ’ @entity1 says			2
he did n’t resent the drill – ‘ i would n’t be same person if i did n’t have someone pushing me			2
’ in spite of all this , @entity1 insists : ‘ i never thought of myself as being different			2
i just thought that putting on braces was one more thing that i had to do to get ready for the day			2
’ @entity109 was adamant that he attend mainstream school and dedicated herself to helping him			2
‘ when we found out he had cerebral palsy , i sat down and cried , ’ she recalls			1
family support : the 20 year old actor and his mum @entity109 who brought him up as a single mother ‘ i was a single mother , as my husband and i separated after we adopted @entity1 i thought , “ how am i going to do this ? ” i called my aunt , who ’s in the medical profession , and she said , “ cry yourself silly today , then get up tomorrow and start doing research			1
find everything that ’s out there			2
raise him as normal as possible			2
and never let him believe that he ca n’t achieve what he wants			2
” so that ’s what i did			2
’ attending a mainstream school was a mixed blessing			2
‘ most kids rallied around him , ’ says @entity109			2
‘ but there were times when he ’d come home and cry			0
’ a scene in the first series of @entity3 involves @entity202 , played by @entity204 - winning actor @entity203 , confronting older teenagers who are taunting his son			1
it was a scenario that rang true for @entity1 ‘ i was a prime target for bullies , ’ he admits			0
indeed , some children physically assaulted him , resulting in him suffering a broken hand			0
every few years , a doctor would suggest the possibility of surgery – something about a third of children with @entity35 undergo			0
there are operations to release tendons in the legs and arms , freeing movement , and procedures to realign hips and straighten the spine			0
dr @entity227 , a consultant paediatrician at @entity228 who specialises in @entity35 , explains : ‘ surgery improves quality of life in about half of patients			0
the condition can get worse again over time			0
@entity237 injections , which relax the muscles , have to be repeated every three months			0
the one treatment we know works incredibly well is regular exercise			0
this improves symptoms in all cases			0
’ cases of @entity35 are on the rise , which is thought to be linked to the increase in multiple pregnancies as a result of fertility treatment			0
a twin birth increases the risk of @entity35 tenfold , as one foetus can starve the other of oxygen			0
the charity scope says that about 1,800 children in the @entity258 are diagnosed every year			0
symptoms vary : some people have problems walking while others are profoundly disabled and require lifelong care			0
speech is affected in a third of cases , but this has no bearing on intellectual development			1
in some cases , those with the condition suffer epileptic seizures and , rarely , learning disabilities			0
in @entity1 ’s case , doctors suggested cutting his @entity278 tendon but instead he threw himself into sport , especially football			0
‘ i was goalie for a bit then played centre - forward			0
i had no trouble running			0
when i was 14 i just said to my doctors , “ i do n’t need these leg braces any more			0
” ’ that year , @entity154 moved the family to @entity287 as her daughter , @entity288 , had received a film offer			0
to meet friends , @entity1 started looking for acting jobs and became an extra on the hit @entity293 show @entity294 , where he played one of @entity297 ’s classmates			0
talent manager @entity298 , who himself has a form of @entity35 , and agent @entity300 , encouraged @entity1 to take acting classes			1
@entity109 recalls : ‘ i pulled the agent aside and said , “ i ’m not sure this is for him – to go to audition after audition and get turned down			0
” but she said , “ i love him			0
i ’m not afraid to say he has cerebral palsy			1
i think you need to let him try			0
” ’ shortly afterwards , @entity1 landed the part in @entity3			1
according to @entity65 , @entity1 is ‘ like cat - nip ’ to the female cast members and crew			0
he also has legions of female fans among the show ’s millions of viewers			0
‘ i ’ve never had any trouble getting girls , which is not to say i have n’t had girl trouble , ’ laughs @entity1 , who is currently single after ending a two - year relationship			0
his growing fame has now spurred him to activism and he ’s become a spokesman for @entity326 charity @entity325 , campaigning for the inclusion of disabled actors , and the portrayal of disability in drama			0
able - bodied actors are often praised for such roles ( @entity334 played @entity336 artist @entity335 in @entity337 and @entity338 will soon star as physicist @entity339 , who has motor neurone disease ) yet disabled @entity342 stars are few and far between			0
@entity343 is all too aware of his position in a show watched regularly by three million people			0
‘ so many people are disabled but we ’re all capable of doing something in our own way , ’ he says			0
‘ i ca n’t tell you how many times a doctor said to me , “ you ’re not going to be able to do this			0
” it only made me determined to say that i would do it			0
my disability made me who i am today			0
‘ @entity342 should n’t be afraid of actors like me			0
diversity can only make the stories better			0
