for , according to pensions minister @entity4 , @entity5 is a @entity11			1
although the party has been languishing in single figures in the polls , he argues that , in the long term , it has the support of the @entity17			2
writing in a new book about the party ’s relationship with @entity21 , mr @entity4 says it is clear from the @entity23 that @entity5 shares the @entity11 ’ core beliefs			1
‘ the most fundamental reason why @entity26 should feel at home in the @entity11 is that the character of @entity5 , as revealed in the @entity29 , would suggest that @entity5 must be a liberal , ’ he writes			1
‘ this assertion will shock or offend some but i believe there is no other conclusion that can be drawn from the @entity33			0
’ he goes on : ‘ those who recognise in the @entity29 a deep reverence for human freedom and self - determination will find a natural home in the @entity11			0
’ his comments come in a new book of essays , @entity11 do @entity5			1
the title is a riposte to former @entity45 spin doctor @entity44 who famously banned questions about @entity48 ’s religious faith by telling reporters : ‘ we do n’t do @entity5 ’			0
despite mr @entity4 ’s eye - catching claims the book is unlikely to feature on @entity55 ’s reading list , since the @entity11 leader has declared himself an atheist			1
but party president @entity58 appears to back mr @entity4 , citing a call to @entity26 ’s by @entity61 to ‘ engage with politics ’			2
writing in the new book , mr @entity58 says : @entity11 stand alone as the defender of the rights of all human beings ’			0
but writing in the same book the @entity69 mp @entity68 warns that the @entity11 have become ‘ anti-religious ’ and ‘ illiberal ’ in their rejection of @entity21			0
@entity72 default : despite the @entity17 supposedly being on his side , @entity55 's party keeps sliding in the polls ‘ i fear that what we are heading towards now in the party is away from freedom of conscience and towards a new moral conformity , ’ he writes			0
mr @entity4 is also taken to task by a prominent @entity11 councillor who pointed out that ‘ virtually every political tradition under the sun has at some time claimed the @entity17 as their own			1
’ @entity88 , a councillor in @entity89 and former editor of the @entity92 newspaper @entity91 , said : ‘ history is littered with assorted dodgy @entity26 tribes hanging their noxious beliefs on particular @entity23 passages			0
indeed slavery and forced conversion was justified on such grounds			0
‘ @entity4 ’s interpretation is , of course , grounded on a wider reading of the @entity23 yet so too is a conservative take on the @entity23			2
’ mr @entity88 went on : ‘ the party is led by a man who has declared he does n’t believe in @entity5 yet his belief in the @entity107 seems to be stronger			2
i do n’t suppose @entity5 believes in suicide yet several disabled people have done just that after ( eligibility ) tests imposed by the department of which @entity4 is a minister of state			1

pensions minister @entity4 claims @entity5 is @entity11
says it is ' clear from the @entity23 ' that the @entity117 agrees with his party
