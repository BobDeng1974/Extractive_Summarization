a @entity7 page run by his campaign uploaded a video this weekend featuring unidentified rappers detailing 84 - year - old representative @entity1 's biography and urging listeners to vote for the ' superfly , stand - up guy ' in the @entity16 primary on tuesday			1
the beat - heavy track thumps as a campaign poster displays on screen			0
the catchy chorus of ' @entity21 , @entity21 , @entity1 ' follows such informative lines as ' he was born in @entity4 ; got a purple heart and bronze star , earned ' em in the @entity26 ' and ' at 16 he worked a lot of low paying jobs so he knows what it means to be poor			1

race has become a major issue in the contest			0

representative @entity1 raised eyebrows when he asked in one debate , ' just what the heck has he done besides saying he 's a @entity65 ?
