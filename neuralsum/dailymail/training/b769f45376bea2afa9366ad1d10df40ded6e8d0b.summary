dropped the case : the court - appointed guardian , @entity1 , who is also a registered nurse , has dropped her attempt to force @entity5 girl , @entity4 , 11 , to have chemotherapy treatment a court was wrong to appoint a guardian to make medical decisions for an @entity5 girl whose parents stopped her chemotherapy against doctors ' wishes , the family 's attorney said in court filings this week			1
the lawyer for @entity4 's family , who have fled their @entity21 home so the 11 - year - old would n't be forced to have treatment , argued that the guardian be allowed to resign			1
@entity28 's guardianship statutes appear to let courts substitute their judgment for that of suitable parents while ignoring the parents ' ' moral and constitutional interests , ' @entity26 wrote in his filing with the @entity36 in @entity37			1
the court should take a narrower view that limits such second - guessing and is consistent with constitutional safeguards of their rights , he wrote			0
to do that , the court must hold ' that the decisions of suitable parents may not be attacked by anyone anytime in an @entity47 , and that these careful and gut - wrenching life and death decisions can not be second - guessed and overruled where the parents are suitable , and simply seek to try a less invasive treatment first , ' wrote @entity26 , who leads the libertarian @entity54 in @entity28			1
@entity55 , an attorney for guardian @entity1 , said thursday that he will submit a response to @entity26 's filing later , but he declined to reveal what it might say			1
@entity4 and her parents fled their home more than two months ago so she would n't be forced to resume chemotherapy for her leukemia			1
instead , they decided to use natural medicines , such as herbs and vitamins			2
disappeared : the @entity68 fled their farm in @entity70 , @entity28 , to avoid their daughter @entity71 getting treatment , which they say is making her sick and are worried it will make her ' infertile ' the @entity68 shun many facets of modern life and are deeply religious			2
they have said they stopped chemotherapy not for religious reasons but because it was making @entity71 too sick and they feared it could end up killing her			0
doctors at @entity81 believe @entity71 's leukemia is treatable but have said she will die within a year without chemotherapy			1
@entity1 , an attorney who 's also a registered nurse , has asked the court to let her drop her attempt to force @entity71 to resume chemotherapy , because it became impossible to make medical decisions for @entity71 after the family fled			1
if approved by a judge , @entity1 's resignation could end the family 's months - long fight against the hospital and pave the way for them to return home , where they live on a farm and operate a produce stand near the village of @entity99 , about 35 miles southwest of @entity100			1
@entity21 probate judge @entity101 has delayed a decision on the resignation request			1
he said he first wants to make sure he has authority to grant it in light of the ongoing appeal in state court			0
in a separate filing on that issue this week , the family 's lawyer argued that @entity101 should immediately accept the resignation and that it would n't hinder the appeal			1
@entity55 has said that an attorney told him the hospital wo n't continue its legal push to get chemotherapy for @entity71 if her guardian 's resignation is approved			2
can be treated : doctors at @entity81 believe @entity71 's leukemia is treatable , but say she will die within a year if she halts chemotherapy @entity1 dropped her attempt to force the child to resume chemotherapy earlier in december			1
the guardian was given the power to make medical decisions for @entity71 after an appeals court ruling in october said the beliefs and convictions of the girl 's parents ca n't outweigh the rights of the state to protect the child			1
but @entity1 decided to drop the effort because she does n't know where @entity71 is now and it has become impossible to monitor her health or make any medical decisions			0
' it did n't make sense to drag this on any longer , ' @entity138			0
@entity71 's father said the family does n't oppose modern medicine and that they did n't make their decision based on religious reasons			2
they end chemotherapy , he said , because it was taking too great of a toll on their daughter and she feared the treatments would make her infertile			0
@entity71 and her parents left their home in rural northeast @entity28 just days before the state appeals court allowed the guardian to take over medical decisions			1
the family left the country in late september before returning to an undisclosed location outside @entity28			0
@entity1 's attempts to meet with the family were rebuffed , @entity55 said			0
traditions : @entity4 ( not pictured ) and her family are @entity5 , and their beliefs force them to shun technology and in turn , some forms of modern medicine the guardian 's decision to withdraw from the case still needs final approval from a county court			2
' the judge 's approval of this resignation will pave the way for the family 's return home , which will allow @entity71 to receive the family 's preferred treatment under the best possible conditions , ' @entity26 said earlier			1
@entity71 's last known chemotherapy session was in june , but she has undergone alternative - therapy treatments and is doing well , her family has said			2
her grandfather , @entity190 , told the @entity191 that his granddaughter @entity71 recently celebrated her 11th birthday and seems vibrant and healthy			0
according to mr @entity190 , blood and imaging tests indicated that @entity71 's cancer is gone			0
@entity26 said the case came down to fundamental principles and constitutional rights			0
' we made it clear to our opponents that they were in for a protracted battle , ' he said			0
@entity205 , the @entity28 girl 's father , said this past summer that the family agreed to begin two years of treatments for @entity71 last spring but stopped a second round of chemotherapy in june because it was making her extremely sick			2
@entity71 begged her parents to stop the chemo and they agreed after a great deal of prayer , @entity4 said			0
the family , members of an insular @entity5 community , shuns many facets of modern life and is deeply religious			0
hospital officials have said they are morally and legally obligated to make sure the girl receives proper care			0
they said the girl 's illness , lymphoblastic lymphoma , is an aggressive form of non-hodgkin lymphoma , but there is a high survival rate with treatment .			0
