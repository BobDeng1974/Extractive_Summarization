@entity0 have claimed they will not have to pay @entity2 compensation in the @entity4 case after having an appeal upheld by the @entity6			1
governing body @entity7 ruled in 2013 that @entity0 and @entity8 had to contribute some of the Â£ 14million owed by @entity4 to @entity2 for a breach of contract			1
the @entity12 club released @entity4 in 2004 following the @entity15 striker 's positive drug test and sought compensation , which they were granted by @entity7 in 2013			1
@entity0 have claimed they will not have to pay @entity2 compensation in the @entity4 case @entity4 joined @entity0 after being let go by the @entity16 , with @entity8 also involved in the transfer , and both @entity19 clubs immediately appealed the @entity7 ruling			1
a statement from @entity0 on wednesday read : ' @entity22 announces today that the @entity6 in @entity23 has notified us of the decision made by the arbitrators in the dispute that pitted @entity2 against @entity0 regarding the signing of @entity4			2
' the arbitrators have completely dismissed the demands made by @entity2 , ordering them ( the @entity12 club ) to play the legal costs of the case			0
' this ruling has no effect on the financial balance of @entity0 because the club , fully aware of being in the right , chose not to allow for any risk in funds over the developing litigation			0
' @entity2 released @entity4 in 2004 following the @entity15 striker 's positive drug test @entity4 signed for @entity0 in january 2005 , but could not immediately join the @entity19 giants because they had their full quota of @entity46 players			1
