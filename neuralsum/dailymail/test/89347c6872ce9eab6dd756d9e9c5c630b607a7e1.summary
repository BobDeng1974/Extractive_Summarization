if @entity2 are to be relegated from the @entity3 , then their new manager @entity0 would want to see them go down kicking and screaming			1
@entity4 took that a little too literally against @entity5 , his red card for a senseless kick at @entity8 punished by a @entity10 side determined to avoid a similar fate			1
when @entity4 , who played for @entity5 on loan from @entity14 in 2013 , lashed out after failing to win a corner on the hour , it was set up for the hosts to claim three precious points			1
and they were duly delivered when @entity19 headed home @entity8 ’s cross with 15 minutes remaining , sending a febrile den into raptures			2
@entity5 team - mates rush to congratulate substitute @entity25 after he scored their second goal lions no 1 @entity28 celebrates after @entity19 came on to break the deadlock with a rare strike @entity4 was one of three players sent off - two for @entity2 and one for @entity5 in the fiesty clash @entity5 : @entity28 ( c ) ; @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity8 ; @entity36 , @entity19 , @entity37 ( @entity38 42 ) , @entity39 ( @entity25 68 ) ; @entity40 ( @entity41 84 ) , @entity42 substitutes not used : @entity43 ( gk ) ; @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 scorers : @entity19 75 ; @entity25 90 +3 booked : @entity42 , @entity39 , @entity38 , @entity35 sent off : @entity36 @entity2 : @entity48 ; @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 ; @entity53 ( @entity54 81 ) , @entity55 ( c ) , @entity56 ( @entity57 90 +1 ) , @entity58 , @entity59 ; @entity60 ( @entity4 53 ) substitutes not used : @entity61 ( gk ) ; @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 booked : @entity52 , @entity65 - @entity58 sent off : @entity4 , @entity66 referee : @entity39 ( @entity68 ) in his six seasons at the club , that was only @entity19 ’s seventh goal			1
what a time for it			2
the official @entity5 @entity75 account reassured followers it was n’t a misprint			2
there was more drama to follow			0
@entity51 followed @entity4 down the tunnel for a dreadful tackle on @entity40 as tempers flared in the closing stages , with @entity5 ’s @entity36 also dismissed for his reaction			1
the game had threatened to erupt all night			0
there were two confrontations in the first - half , with @entity0 and his @entity5 counterpart @entity88 on the edge of their technical areas appealing for calm			1
and a second goal from @entity25 in the third minute of stoppage time made absolutely sure , the substitute leading a breakaway on his own before finishing calmly past @entity48			1
@entity5 ’s win keeps the @entity3 relegation battle very much alive and throws the pressure onto @entity100 , who face @entity102 on wednesday night			1
the plot could also thicken further if @entity100 are docked three points for fielding an ineligible player in their win over @entity108 earlier this month			0
@entity110 is still very much alive in south @entity111 after this , the gap closed to just four points			0
@entity88 had described this match as a ‘ @entity115 ’ and his players responded			0
snapping into every challenge , first to every ball , they wanted it more than @entity0 ’s men			2
@entity2 's former @entity121 and @entity122 winger @entity53 ( left ) takes on @entity8 of @entity5 @entity5 's @entity123 ( left ) competes with @entity49 of @entity2 during the relegation six - pointer the @entity10 manager proudly declared afterwards : ‘ that was a @entity5 performance , that ’s what this club is all about			1
if the players have n’t learned anything from me before tonight , they certainly have now			0
‘ i do n’t necessarily condone challenges and melees but if you need a spark at @entity135 , then you have to take care of your own			0
’ and he could n’t resist a joke at the expense of @entity19 ’s scoring record after his first goal in two years			1
‘ @entity19 is a great fellow , a great servant to @entity5 , ’ he said			1
‘ if anyone deserved that goal for his performances since i took over			2
he has the ability to do that and i ’ve been telling him for seven years he can do that			0
‘ he ’s got the ability in the legs , i think his last goal was in training about three and a half years ago ! ’ with @entity2 seven points from safety , @entity5 ’s approach left manager @entity0 irritated			1
he said : ‘ there was one team out there trying to play football and another trying to rough us up			0
‘ the game got out of hand second - half , we needed a strong ref in a stadium like this			0
’ @entity2 ’s @entity166 rattled the outside of the post with a cross-cum - shot that almost caught goalkeeper @entity28 out after five minutes , while at the other end , @entity48 had to race off his line to thwart @entity40 when he broke clear			2
but overall the first - half was a poor spectacle , enlivened only by the handbags that engaged the crowd			0
@entity2 's @entity55 ( right ) goes up for a header with @entity5 midfielder @entity37 @entity2 manager @entity0 looks on nervously as his hopes of survival are dented within the first five minutes of the second - half , @entity5 created more than their sum total in the first			1
former @entity182 stopper @entity48 had to be at his athletic best to turn away an @entity40 shot that seemed destined for the top corner			0
and when thew red mist descended on @entity188 , there was only one winner			0
it coincided with @entity5 ’s best spell in the game and they capitalised when @entity19 produced his potentially season - defining header			1
after @entity25 made sure at the end , chants of ‘ @entity196 ’ echoed around the ground			2
is another heroic act from this club legend on the cards ?			0
