@entity0 has sent its @entity2 rover to investigate a mysterious set of rocks they have dubbed the ' pink cliffs ' they form a strange ledge that @entity0 is keen to examine , and possibly drill into			1
it is hoped the unique formation could give clues to how @entity12 formed			0
this image combines several frames , and the colour has been altered to resemble how it would appear on @entity23			0
exposed layers on the lower portion of @entity26 , where curiosity is , are expected to hold evidence about dramatic changes in the environmental evolution of @entity12			0
that was a major reason @entity0 chose this area of @entity12 for this mission			1
this view is a mosaic of exposures acquired by @entity2 's @entity37 ( @entity38 ) shortly before a two - week walkabout up the outcrop , scouting to select which targets to examine in greater detail during a second pass			1
this small ridge , about 3 feet ( 1 meter ) long , appears to resist wind erosion more than the flatter plates around it			1
such differences are among the rock characteristics that @entity0 's @entity2 is examining at selected targets at the base of @entity26			1
the ridge pictured here , called ' @entity50 , ' is within the ' @entity52 ' outcrop forming part of the basal layer of the mountain			1
' we see a diversity of textures in this outcrop -- some parts finely layered and fine - grained , others more blocky with erosion - resistant ledges , ' said curiosity deputy project scientist @entity64 of @entity0 's @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67			1
' overlaid on that structure are compositional variations			0
some of those variations were detected with our spectrometer			0
others show themselves as apparent differences in cementation or as mineral veins			0
' there 's a lot to study here			0
' the pink cliffs image combines several frames taken with the @entity38 on oct. 7 , 2014 , the 771st @entity12 day , or sol of @entity2 's work on @entity12			1
the colour has been approximately white - balanced to resemble how the scene would appear under daytime lighting conditions on @entity23			2
it comes as @entity0 's @entity2 completed a reconnaissance ' walkabout ' of the first outcrop it reached at the base of the mission 's destination mountain			1
a wheel track cuts through a windblown ripple of dusty sand in this nov. 7 , 2014 , image from the @entity38 on @entity0 's @entity2			1
the view spans about four feet across			0
this experiment was planned for yielding a view of the inside of the ripple for assessment of particle sizes and composition			0
one motive for this experiment was to learn why some ripples that @entity2 drove into earlier this year were more difficult to cross than anticipated			1
exposed layers on the lower portion of @entity26 are expected to hold evidence about dramatic changes in the environmental evolution of @entity12			0
that was a major reason @entity0 chose this area of @entity12 for this mission			1
the lowermost of these slices of time ascending the mountain includes a pale outcrop called ' @entity52			0
' it bears layers of diverse textures that the mission has been studying since @entity2 acquired a drilled sample from the outcrop in september			1
in its first pass up this outcrop , @entity2 drove about 360 feet ( 110 meters ) , and scouted sites ranging about 30 feet ( 9 meters ) in elevation			2
it evaluated potential study targets from a distance with mast - mounted cameras and a laser - firing spectrometer			2
during a second pass up the outrcrop , the mission is using a close - up camera and spectrometer on the rover 's arm to examine selected targets in more detail			2
the second - pass findings will feed into decisions about whether to drill into some target rocks during a third pass , to collect sample material for onboard laboratory analysis			2
this patch of @entity12 bedrock , about 2 feet ( 70 centimeters ) across , is finely layered rock with some pea - size rocks			2
it lies near the lowest point of the ' @entity52 ' outcrop of @entity26 , where @entity0 hopes researchers will find clues about the planet 's past			2
' the variations we 've seen so far tell us that the environment was changing over time , both as the sediments were laid down and also after they hardened into bedrock , ' @entity64 said			0
' we have selected targets that we think give us the best chance of answering questions about how the sediments were deposited -- in standing water ? flowing water ? sand blowing in the wind ? -- and about the composition during deposition and later changes			0
' @entity2 landed on @entity12 in august 2012 , but before beginning the drive toward @entity26 , the rover spent much of the mission 's first year productively studying an area much closer to the landing site , but in the opposite direction			1
the mission accomplished its science goals in that @entity179			0
analysis of drilled rocks there disclosed an ancient lakebed environment that , more than three billion years ago , offered ingredients and a chemical energy gradient favorable for microbes , if any existed there			0
@entity2 spent its second year driving more than 5 miles ( 8 kilometers ) from @entity179 to the base of @entity26 , with pauses at a few science waypoints .			2

@entity0 has dubbed rocky ledge the ' @entity50 ' and wants to examine how it seems to resist wind erosion
has sent @entity2 to examine the area - and it could even drill into them
