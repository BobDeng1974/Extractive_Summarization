by @entity0 published : 05:03 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 11:18 est , 26 july 2012 summer has arrived at last and sun - deprived @entity2 have been flocking to the country 's beaches to bask in soaring temperatures after enduring weeks of soggy weather			1
but not everyone will be welcoming the respite from the rain			0
the sudden change in weather has come with an unfortunate side effect for hay fever sufferers - soaring pollen counts			1
the seemingly endless weeks of rain in the @entity2 since spring have seen pollen - bearing grasses and weeds flourish			1
the tiny particles spread easily on humid days , and the current hot spell has seen an increase in the amount of pollen in the air			0
heatwave : @entity27 beach was swarmed with sunbathers yesterday , all eager to enjoy every minute of @entity2 's long awaited hot weather - but the rising temperatures come at a price for allergy sufferers @entity33 , from @entity34 , said hay fever sufferers might see their symptoms flare up after the sudden change in weather			1
tissues at the ready : the orange symbols on this map indicate high pollen counts over much of the @entity2 ' because the weather has been so up and down people might be thinking they had got away with it , ' she said , explaining that wet weather keeps levels of pollens that trigger hay fever lower			1
' when it 's warm weather , and it 's a little bit breezy , ( symptoms ) are going to really kick in , ' she said			0
' things like weeds and grasses and trees are all pollinated by the wind , and ( the particles ) are really small so winds carry them long distances			0
' @entity2 's estimated 16 million hay fever sufferers have already been warned that the chaotic weather could see the country 's hay fever season last up to a month longer than usual			1
the season normally ends in july , but experts have said the freak weather could leave sufferers enduring sneezing fits , sore throats and watery eyes well into august			0
at the beginning of the month @entity73 reported a 20 per cent increase in calls from hay fever sufferers during the early summer months compared to the same period in 2011			1
@entity78 , health manager at the @entity79 , said the settled , drier weather would be reflected in boosted pollen counts			2
' the unsettled weather this summer has led to a fluctuating pollen count but as expected we have seen some very high levels when the weather has been good , ' he added			1
making a splash : these young girls found respite from the scorching heat in a fountain in central @entity92 yesterday time for a dip : a young boy cools off in a fountain in @entity92 yesterday , as parts of @entity2 enjoyed hotter weather than @entity98 diving display : young men threw themselves from a jetty and into the sea in @entity27 to escape soaring temperatures at the coast picturesque paddle : a group of girls dip their feet in the water beside the weir on the @entity111 at @entity2 's last remaining river swimming club in @entity113 , @entity114 , near @entity115 with people all over the country revelling in the glorious sunshine , it would be easy to forget that less than a fortnight ago large swathes of @entity2 remained on flood alert after persistent heavy downpours at the start of the month followed the wettest april to june period on record			2
around 3,000 homes and businesses were flooded and people were swept to their deaths as @entity2 was battered by rain for weeks on end			2
the wet weather also saw roads closed off , cars marooned in flood water , and rivers bursting their banks			0
even this month rainfall has hit 71.8mm , above the typical 69.6mm july average			0
what a difference : less than two weeks ago @entity139 were struggling to hold on to their umbrellas as they battled across @entity141 in the wind and rain soggy cycling : just a fortnight ago flood warnings were in place in @entity147 after the @entity148 burst its banks @entity150 : a woman in @entity153 shelters from the heavy rain under her umbrella earlier this month such sodden scenes may seem a distant memory today , as the south of @entity159 enjoys more blue skies and blazing sunshine , but forecasters have warned the heatwave is not expected to last past the weekend			2
lucky folks with a ticket for the 2012 @entity167 opening ceremony in @entity168 , @entity92 , tomorrow , will be hoping the spectacular summer weather will hold			0
but the @entity79 has said there is a 50/50 chance of showers tomorrow evening , and a 20 per cent chance they will be heavy .			0

sudden change in weather will see boosted pollen count , experts warn
after weeks of rain keeping pollen levels low , the hot , breezy spell could see a surge in hay fever symptoms
@entity2 is enjoying a *mini-heatwave* after a soggy start to the summer , but forecasters say rain could return tomorrow
