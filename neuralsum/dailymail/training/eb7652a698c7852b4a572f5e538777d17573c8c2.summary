if @entity2 ’s new - look frontline is going to start firing fours and fives , there ’s a still a danger the boys at the back could concede one more			1
while we have been salivating over the prospect of @entity11 and @entity12 joining forces with @entity14 and @entity15 , reinforcement at the other end of the park was somewhat neglected			1
yes , @entity19 arrived from @entity20 , but a 24 - year - old debuting in the @entity22 hardly fills the void left by the exits of @entity25 and @entity26			1
rather than mask the shortcomings of those in defence , the system has , thus far at least , left them exposed and seemingly confused			2
it does not matter how an opponent attacks them – be it land or air , centrally or wide – panic ensues at every advancement			0
two were conceded at home to @entity50 and four at @entity52 @entity51 in the @entity53 , the latter seeing @entity55 terrorised by lower - league frontmen			1
even at @entity59 – a 1 - 1 draw – @entity2 ’s backline was shambolic and was spared only thanks to some errant finishing			1
tough start : @entity2 are yet to win this season and are out of the @entity53 @entity64 is on trial for club and country at present – he ’ll line up for @entity68 in @entity69 on monday night – while the international credentials of the injured @entity71 will also be under scrutiny on his return			1
@entity74 remains absent through injury and @entity76 has less professional appearances ( 16 ) than his age ( 20 )			0
there has even been talk of @entity81 – another confined to the treatment room – reverting from midfield to centre - back in a bid to aid their cause			2
attacking talent : @entity2 signed @entity11 and @entity12 in the transfer window settled it is not and @entity91 and his backroom team will need to put in some serious hours on the training pitches of @entity94 over the coming months			1
here , @entity95 takes a closer at look at who they ’ll be working with … @entity64 sir @entity98 once said @entity64 could become one of the club ’s greatest - ever players			2
in his defence he ’s still only 22 and has ample time to prove @entity98 right , but on recent evidence his former manager ’s words appear folly			0
he is error prone and lacks the defensive cunning of a @entity26 or @entity25			0
( @entity111 ) rating : @entity112 error prone : @entity64 is struggling to live up to the hype of his early career @entity19 he was labelled @entity117 ’s weak link prior to the @entity118 but played his part in the team which finished second to @entity121 and emerged with his reputation enhanced			0
but at £ 16m and given the defensive woes at @entity126 , there is already pressure on him to right their rearguard wrongs – and that is perhaps too much expectation given his lack of experience			0
rating : 7/10 unknown quantity : @entity19 has not played for @entity2 yet following his move @entity55 he ’ll be in no hurry to return to @entity138			1
but @entity52 looked about his level during the @entity53 humbling and that would have done little for his confidence			2
he is , of course , far better than that showing but questions remain over his credentials as a @entity2 starter			2
rating : @entity112 poor display : @entity55 had a nightmare evening against @entity51 in the @entity53 @entity71 @entity71 and @entity64 were supposed to be the future of @entity2 and @entity68			1
both , however , are fighting to restore damaged reputations			0
@entity71 is yet to mature into the leader many hoped he would and , at 24 , this is a big season for the former non-league defender			0
rating : @entity112 the future ? @entity71 has yet to mature into the leader that many expected him to become @entity74 there has already been much debate over his fitness and physique and , before he ’s even kicked a @entity22 ball for the club , the 19 - year - old finds himself under the spotlight			1
if @entity91 is to persist with 3 - 5 - 2 then @entity74 – an orthodox left - back – will have to learn how to adapt his game to a wing - back posting			0
rating : @entity171 teenage kicks : @entity74 became the most expensive teenager in @entity68 when he joined for £ 30m @entity76 the 20 - year - old has started the season in the side but is n’t expected to stay there			1
at @entity59 , in particular , he was torn between his centre - back duty and filling the hole at left - back exposed by @entity182 ’s reluctance to defend			0
this backline is hardly the preferred environment to blood a promising youngster			0
rating : 6/10 young hope : @entity76 has made a number of appearances this season but could soon be replaced @entity191 injury means he is yet to feature this season but a wing - back role would surely be to his liking and there is little competition at right - back should @entity91 switch to a traditional four			2
rating : 7/10 on the sidelines : @entity191 has missed the start of the season due to injury @entity81 he has previously impressed at centre - back but that was in a team on the front foot			2
it will be a different scenario entirely were the midfielder to find himself under siege			0
rating : 6/10 moving back : @entity81 is a midfielder but has impressed at centre back in the past @entity212 he ’s been brought to the club as a midfielder but he nonetheless appeared in defence for @entity216 under @entity91 and could well find himself back there were their problems to persist			0
rating : 7/10 new boy : @entity222 signed @entity223 utility man @entity212 from @entity224 at the end of the transfer window @entity227 salutes ' unbelievable ' @entity2 attack			1

@entity2 spent the most in the transfer window this *summer* - but their defence is still looking vulnerable
@entity28 *'s* side have not won this season , are 14th in the @entity22 and are out of the @entity53
@entity2 have plenty of options going forward with @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity15 , @entity14 and @entity238
