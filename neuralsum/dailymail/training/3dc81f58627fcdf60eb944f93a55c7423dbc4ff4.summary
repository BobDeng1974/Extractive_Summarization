by @entity0 electric cars have been silently taking over our garages , streets and cities			2
but while the vehicles may be good for the planet , some people are concerned their magnetic fields may not be good for a driver ’s health			0
now a seven - country study argues that these concerns are unfounded with evidence to suggest electric cars do not generate electromagnetic fields higher than the dose recommended			1
when electric cars first began appearing on our roads , some people were worried about the dangers of electromagnetic fields ( @entity23 ) that might affect drivers			1
now a seven - country study has found that the magnetic fields in electric vehicles pose no danger as their @entity23 levels are below recommended standards the dangers of electromagnetic fields in hybrid and electric vehicles began emerging on internet forums as soon as the first car began appearing on our roads			1
the flow of electrical current to the motor that moves a hybrid vehicle produces electromagnetic fields ( @entity23 )			1
a number of studies have linked @entity23 exposure with serious health issues , including a possible risk of cancer , miscarriage and a higher risk of leukaemia among children			1
batteries and power cables in electric and hybrid vehicles are usually placed close to the driver and passengers , meaning that prolonged exposure to electromagnetic fields is unavoidable			2
the highest values of electromagnetic exposure in electric cars were measured near the floor , close to the battery itself and when starting the cars			1
in all cases , exposure to magnetic fields was lower than 20 per cent of the value recommended by the @entity68 on @entity69 ( @entity70 ) ‘ some members of the public have attributed a diffuse collection of symptoms to low levels of exposure to electromagnetic fields at home , ’ according to the @entity79			2

’ according to a report by @entity126 in the @entity127 , a number of hybrid owners tested their cars for electromagnetic fields using hand - held meters and were alarmed by the results			0
but the latest study , led by @entity134 - based @entity133 , argues these concerns have been blown out of proportion			0
@entity23 levels in seven different electric cars , one hydrogen - powered car , two petrol - fuelled cars and one diesel - fuelled car were measured in the laboratory and during road tests			2
the highest values of electromagnetic exposure in electric cars were measured near the floor , close to the battery itself and when starting the cars			1
in all cases , exposure to magnetic fields was lower than 20 per cent of the value recommended by the @entity68 on @entity69 ( @entity70 )			2
sensors picked up a burst of radiation that same level , when the cars were started			0
measurements taken at head - height - using a test dummy with sensors located in the head , chest and feet - were shown to be less than two per cent of the recommended value			0
the flow of electrical current to the motor that moves a hybrid vehicle or electric produces electromagnetic fields ( @entity23 )			1
a number of studies have linked @entity23 exposure with serious health issues , including a possible risk cancer , miscarriage , depression and a higher risk of leukaemia among children in the case of petrol and diesel powered cars , exposure was measured at around 10 per cent of the exposure levels considered to be safe			1
‘ there is absolutely no cause for concern , ’ said @entity191 , a physicist at @entity192			0
‘ the difference between this research and similar earlier work is that we have taken into account what contributes to the magnetic fields			0
‘ the rotation of the wheels themselves generates considerable magnetic fields , irrespective of vehicle type			0
’ the @entity208 - funded research project @entity209 is the most comprehensive study yet carried out to identify different sources of magnetic fields in electric cars .			0
