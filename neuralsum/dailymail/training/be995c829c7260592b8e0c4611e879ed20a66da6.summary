by @entity0 if they were n’t in the middle of a ‘ conscious uncoupling ’ , it sounds like exactly the sort of thing @entity7 would go for			1
the 10 - year marriage renewal is the latest ' in ' thing - and not just with celebs , but us ' normal ' people too			2
it does initially seem like a bit of a show - off - silly idea but , on reflection , i think it ’s a damn good one			1
if you got married early - and by early i mean within the first 18 months ( it takes at least three years before you really know someone , surely ? ) - you had no idea what you were getting yourself into			1
@entity0 says that renewing your vows after ten years is the perfect way of refreshing your relationship values pledging to ' love , honour and ( does anyone really say this anymore ? ) obey ' is a breeze when you 're in the hormone - fuelled , crazed infatuation period because you ’re blissfully unaware of what circumstances you ’ll be doing any of this in			1
ditto pledging to forsake all others when you ’re both still on ( semi- ) best behaviour , firm in flesh and seeing a gloriously air - brushed reflection of yourself in each other ’s idealistic eyes			2
loving someone ten years in is real love			0
we talk about ' unconditional love ' ( i 'll love you no matter what you do ) but even mothers , the experts at this , struggle now and then			0
i think the closest thing you get to ' unconditional love ' romantically is still loving someone after a decade of living and being together , seeing and accepting every quirk , habit and idiosyncrasy			2
that ’s quite a compliment - and even more so if you ’ve brought up children together and still able to smile rather than snarl first thing in the morning			1
@entity0 says that renewing your vows is a great way of making up for a cheesy first wedding there ’s another bonus to renewing vows that far in - you can write totally different @entity75 time firmly grounded in reality ... with loads of conditions attached			1
' i promise to continue to love you if you stop being a grumpy old sod when you ’re stressed , tell your godawful mother we ’re not spending every sunday of our lives listening to her carry on about the roast and lose ten kilos because it ’s hard enough being a parent , let alone a single parent			2
' just think of the sex clauses you could include ! ' i promise to have sex with you on saturday afternoons but only if you do all the dishes for a week beforehand and massage my feet for a minimum of 40 minutes a night			0
each session is to be preceded by a minimum of half an hour of foreplay ( to be specified depending on what i ’m in the mood for at the time )			0
' the more i think about it , the more i like it			0
perhaps couples who do n’t fancy forking out for another dress and splashing cash they do n’t have , should stage their own little commitment ceremony in the lounge , where they hash out the terms and conditions for the next ten years during the ad breaks of @entity111			0
not a bad idea , eh ? for those who do want to go the whole hog , these are the new ‘ rules ’ ( apparently ) : good reasons to justify why you 're renewing your vows ten years later : not so good reasons to justify it : renewing vows is n’t legally binding , so anyone can do it - your granny , your kids , any local celebrity you can rustle up			1
do n’t expect presents ( no , you really must n’t ) , do n’t have fake ‘ bridesmaids ’ and ‘ best men ’ and do n't even think about having a hen or stag do			0
they were bad enough first time around			0

@entity0 is becoming far keener on the idea of renewing wedding vows
she says it 's a great way of *redefining* relationship expectations
it also gives you an excuse to make up for cheesy first weddings
the *photos* from your first wedding were *shocking* and you ’ve since lost two stone
your wedding was truly cheesy or you 're too *embarrassed* to admit you got married *underwater*
you ’ve been through a rough time together but *emerged* , *victorious* , the other side .
you ’ve got lots more money now and want a reason to show off .
all your friends are doing it .
you want an excuse to post glam pictures on your *20* different *social* media *accounts*
there ’s a dress you ’ve got your eye on that ’s *horrendously* *expensive* but you could justify *buying* it if it was a ' wedding ' dress ( actually , move this to the ' *acceptable* ' pile . if you want it that badly , get the damn thing ! )
