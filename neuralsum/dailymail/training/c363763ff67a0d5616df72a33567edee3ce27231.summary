by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity3 reporter published : 10:40 est , 15 april 2013 updated : 15:09 est , 15 april 2013 the @entity4 has ordered an inspection of more than 1,000 @entity6 , the most popular jet model used worldwide , to examine the tail planes for a potentially faulty part which could cause pilots to lose control of the aircraft if it failed			1
the airworthiness directive issued by the @entity4 calls on airlines and other operators to replace tail plane fixing pins with improved pins following concerns over how their protective surface coating was applied			2
the directive comes just days after a @entity6 , the most commonly used aircraft in the world , crashed off the coast of @entity25 as the @entity27 flight lost control as the jet approached the runway			1
it is not immediately believed the fixing pin was a factor in the accident , in which all 108 people aboard survived			1
the @entity4 has ordered an inspection of more than 1,000 @entity6 jets after finding a potentially catastrophic problem with fixing pins on the tails ' we are issuing this ad to prevent premature failure of the attach pins , which could cause reduced structural integrity of the horizontal stabilizer to fuselage attachment , resulting in loss of control of the airplane , ' the @entity4 said in the directive issued on monday			1
the airworthiness directive was posted on the website of @entity54			0
the @entity4 said the inspection was ' prompted by reports of an incorrect procedure used to apply the wear and corrosion protective surface coating to attach pins of the horizontal stabilizer rear spar			2
' @entity4 said its directive affects 1,050 aircraft flown by @entity65 carriers and may cost up to $ 10.1 million across the fleet , or up to $ 9,627 per aircraft			1
the directive applies to models including 737 - 600 , 737 - 700 , 737 - @entity70 , 737 - 800 , 737 - 900 , and 737 - @entity72 series aircraft			0
the @entity4 order only applies to @entity65 - based carriers but foreign governments may adopt similar inspections , the @entity73 reported			2
the order takes effect in late may and is not expected to have an impact on flight schedules			1
this @entity6 crashed into the sea off the coast of @entity25 on saturday but it is not believed to have been caused by the potentially faulty fixing pin on saturday , a @entity6 smashed into the sea off the coast of @entity25			1
all 108 people aboard the @entity27 flight survived and an investigation is underway to determine the crash 's cause			1
the pilot has described how he felt it ' dragged ' down by wind while he struggled to regain control , a person familiar with the matter said			0
officials stress it is too early to say what caused the incident , which is being investigated by @entity101 authorities with the assistance of @entity65 crash investigators and @entity6			0
but initial debriefings , witness comments and weather bulletins have focused attention on the possibility of ' wind shear ' or a downdraft from storm clouds known as a ' microburst			0
' although rare , experts say such violent and localized gusts can leave even the most modern jet helpless if they are stronger than the plane 's ability to fly out of trouble - with the critical moments before landing among the most vulnerable			0
the pilot of the @entity27 jet reported feeling ' dragged ' down by a microburst of wind news of the inspections come a little more than week after @entity6 said its successful flight of a 787 should be the final test of the battery problems that have kept the plane grounded			0
@entity6 called the flight ' the final certification test for the new battery system			0
' it will analyze the data and submit materials to the @entity4 , which will then decide whether @entity6 's battery fix is good enough for airlines to safely fly it again			2
final check : a @entity6 - owned 787 production plane built for @entity140 lands after a demonstration flight last week meant to be the final certification test for the 787 's new battery system			0

the @entity4 has ordered an inspection of the jets
a fixing pin on the planes ' tales may not have received proper coating and could corrode
a @entity6 crashed into the coast of @entity25 over the weekend , in which all 108 people aboard survived , but the accident is not believed to have been caused by the fixing pin
the inspection will cost carriers more than $ 10 million but is not expected to *change* flight schedules
