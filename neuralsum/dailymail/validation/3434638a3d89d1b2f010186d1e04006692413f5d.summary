scientists at the @entity12 have warned of the danger after analysing data collected from beaches across @entity16 and @entity17 in 2012			1
they focused on a strain of @entity9 bacteria resistant to an important class of antibiotics called third - generation cephalosporins , or @entity23			0
swimmers and surfers are most at risk of catching the @entity9 bug as they are more likely to swallow contaminated water , a study has suggested study leader dr @entity26 said : ' we know very little about how the natural environment can spread antibiotic - resistant bacteria to humans , or how our exposure to these microbes can affect health			1
' people are exposed to antibiotic - resistant bacteria in many ways , through person - to - person contact , via food and as a result of international travel			0
' our research establishes recreational use of coastal waters as an additional route of exposure			0
' with millions of people visiting beaches in @entity16 and @entity17 each year , there is a risk of people ingesting @entity49 resistant @entity9 and it looks like water - users ' exposure to all resistant bacteria could be even higher			1
' if you enjoy a dip in the sea and you risk picking up a strain of @entity9 bacteria ( pictured ) resistant to an important class of antibiotics salt in sea water is known to kill off some bacteria , but not all			2
although only 0.12 per cent of the @entity9 found in coastal waters and rivers running on to beaches belonged to the strain , researchers said this was enough to present a ' potential risk '			2
the study , published in the journal @entity72 , showed risk of exposure was closely related to the water quality at any given beach			2
researchers said this demonstrated the importance of the @entity81 's @entity80 , which aims to ensure good water quality standards , but added that people should not be put off visiting the seaside .			0

swimmers and surfers are most at risk of catching @entity9 bug , study claims
this is because they are more likely to swallow contaminated water
