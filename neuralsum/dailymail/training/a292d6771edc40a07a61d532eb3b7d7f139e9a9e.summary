' the football match between @entity2 and @entity8 was eagerly awaited in our city and we watched fine performances from both teams in a fair - play sporting atmosphere			2

' @entity2 resolutely disavows with anti-semitic banner displayed yesterday			0
the message displayed on that banner is completely opposite to preferences and opinions of almost all citizens of @entity11 and @entity2 fans			1

in cooperation with competent authorities , @entity81 will do everything to locate , trial and ban those perpetrators from sporting fields			0

‘ incidents are n’t dealt with in the appropriate manner within those countries - if they do n’t take a firm stance and they ’re allowed to slide , the reality is it will continue to happen			0
‘ we need @entity0 to take a lead , which they have done more over the last couple of years , and demonstrate clearly that these sorts of incidents are completely unacceptable			2
’ @entity146 added : ‘ it ’s always disappointing when any incident like this occurs			0
