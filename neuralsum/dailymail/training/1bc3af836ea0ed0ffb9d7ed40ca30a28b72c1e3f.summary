i am 56 years old			1
and i can not swim			2
worse , i am petrified of water			1
that ’s why i felt a twinge of sadness earlier this month when i read that nearly half of @entity11 children will leave school unable to swim			2
i can only hope their lives wo n’t be blighted as mine has been			2
there is a reason for this fear			1
when i was five , at a summer camp in @entity20 , my parents went for a walk , while i played on the beach with children from the camp			1
at that moment , my lifelong fear of water was born			1
no matter how hard i tried , or how much money was invested in swimming lessons , i never got over it			1
years later , i learned why my father behaved as he did			1
when he and my mother lost my older brother in a cot death , my father had to go to the morgue — and there saw the tiny body of a child who had drowned			1
he was so traumatised by the sight , compounding his grief for my brother , that he was forever after petrified that i would drown			1
as an older child , i spent most summers learning to swim — and failing spectacularly			1
my stepfather would patiently stand over me as i struggled			2
i was given every opportunity : he taught me on holiday in the shallow water of the beautiful island of @entity59 , @entity60 , and paid for lessons in a luxury hotel spa			1
i could n’t even conquer my fear when a hunky @entity64 took great pains to teach me in a @entity67 swimming pool in the complex where i was then living			1
even walking alongside a canal brought a twinge of fear , in case i slipped and could n’t stay afloat			1
by the time i hit 50 , i had long since resigned myself to being unable to swim and spent holidays reading by the pool , done up in a bikini , but dry as a bone			2
sobering statistics , such as there being 400 drowning deaths a year , made me unwilling to even dangle my feet in the water			1
but every so often , i ’d get a nagging feeling			2
was my failure to learn a sign of weakness ? i ’d always been proud of my ability to conquer adversity			2
then i read about @entity25 , of @entity26 , who has a revolutionary way of teaching swimming : the @entity93			1
named after @entity95 , the former competitive swimmer who devised it 25 years ago , it uses the principles of body awareness and natural balance to radically change a pupil ’s relationship with water			1
while most swimming lessons are adapted for children or adults , this method is purely for grown - ups , so it ’s especially good for those with a long - held fear			1
it ’s based on the @entity112 , a way of correcting posture , which is usually taught on land and is particularly popular with @entity116 workers suffering from the stresses of bad posture			2
celebrity aficionados of the @entity112 include @entity120 and @entity121			2
but in water , i ’m told , it works just as well , transforming the body ’s reaction to water — and the mind ’s , too			1
could this finally be my answer ? @entity129 i meet @entity25 in a heated , shallow pool in the @entity132 @entity131 , @entity133			1
although i ’m assured i will never be out of my depth , i am terrified			2
i start by kicking off from the pool wall ( one of the few things i ’ve managed to learn over the years ) , but @entity25 immediately stops me			1
apparently , that ’s a bad habit			0
instead , she shows me how to start with both feet on the ground , so i do n’t wobble or feel out of control			0
she is perfectly nice about it , but i feel like a schoolgirl being ticked off			0
and then — disaster ! — i make the most basic of errors by taking a deep breath before putting my face in the water			1
‘ that ’s a common mistake by beginners , ’ says jan. ‘ all that breath makes you too buoyant , as you have too much air in your mouth			0
’ i ’m aware of how pathetic i seem , but am determined to persevere			0
when i ’m running out of breath , @entity25 tells me to drop my nose down , put my feet on the bottom of the pool and stick my head out of the water			1
i follow her advice and glide a foot or two — which , to my surprise , i find easy			0
i have n’t panicked at all and leave thrilled			0
@entity167 today , we do everything again , but this time , as i am doing my underwater glide it suddenly dawns on me that i ’m doing it , and i stop out of terror , swallow a mouthful of water , and come up spluttering			1
my nerves have got the better of me			0
i feel sick with frustration			0
‘ you ’re getting calmer in the water and i think you are making progress , ’ she says			1
lesson three this time , @entity25 tells me to try to glide on one side , then the other			1
i hate every second of it			0
i feel as if i am sinking and drowning			0
now i really have hit a wall			0
@entity25 asks whether i ’ve ever had any kind of health issue to do with balance			1
i remember a terrible bout of labyrinthitis , an acute inner - ear infection , when i was 19			0
‘ that explains everything , ’ she says			0
‘ you have the memory of a traumatic event and , when you turn sideways , that triggers it and terrifies you			0
’ she concludes it will take a huge amount of time for me to overcome this and master the side crawl			0
instead , we decide i should try to learn the ‘ @entity203 ’			0
i ’m to start in ‘ the armchair position ’ : knees bent , arms resting on the surface in front of me			0
‘ then , when you lean back to do the backstroke , you will go into a pendulum swing , which means you move down into the water , and your hips go back , ’ says jan. it sounds frightening , but i do it			2
within seconds , i find myself on my back , staring at the ceiling — a triumph ! then , just as i ’m starting to believe i ’ve got it nailed , i feel myself toppling to one side			0
@entity25 tells me that if i move my eyes around , i ’ll automatically become unstable , so my gaze must be fixed to one point			1
i follow her advice and , with her hand supporting me lightly , float the length of the pool			0
@entity228 we go to a different pool , with a temperature of 31 degrees , which means my muscles will relax			0
@entity25 spends the lesson giving me @entity234 — a subtle form of massage manipulation excellent for loosening the spine and replacing bad memories of water with good			1
she holds my head in the crook of her arm , supports my shoulders and legs while afloat and slowly turns my body			2
i ’m not sure how this is helping me swim , but it ’s so relaxing , i almost fall asleep ! lesson five we discover a problem			0
as i ’m a writer , and spend hours at the computer , the muscles in my arm are shorter than most			0
as a result , i have difficulty stretching my arms out fully in the water — no good for performing actual strokes			2
@entity25 ’s solution is to imagine i ’m holding on to a bar in front of me			1
amazingly , this simple visualisation changes everything			0
‘ it really is all about your thoughts , ’ she says			0
rather than flail and panic , i ’m using my brain to understand my movements			0
by the end of my seventh lesson , i manage to swim four lengths , unaided , on my back			0
i ’ve never felt more proud			0
at last , in my fifth decade , i can swim			0
i may not be winning medals , but i know next time i ’m on holiday , i wo n’t be sitting at the side of the pool , but slipping into the water			2
and , who knows , maybe i ’ll even swim a few lengths .			0
