the trial of alleged honeymoon killer @entity2 is more likely than ever to collapse after a string of blows to prosecution evidence , a legal expert has claimed			1
the @entity7 's @entity6 said he still believes @entity2 's lawyers could apply to have the case discharged within days , after fresh claims it is ' short on evidence '			1
@entity13 law allows defendants to have their trial dismissed - without having to take the stand - if a judge decides prosecutors have presented a flimsy case			1
mr @entity6 previously said the millionaire 's lawyers had ' strong reasons ' to try and have the case discharged when the prosecution case closes - likely to be this week			1
today he repeated his view in an interview with @entity46			0
' it 's probably more likely to be withdrawn the longer the case goes on , ' he said			2
' the high water mark of the state 's case has still been the evidence of the three main witnesses , and based on their testimony the state would certainly struggle to secure a conviction			2
' fragile : @entity2 denies involvement in the death of his wife @entity59 ( pictured with him at their wedding ) the first two of the witnesses were driver @entity64 and hitman @entity65 , both of whom were jailed for the murder of @entity59 - and mr @entity6 claimed their evidence was ' riddled with inconsistencies '			1
the third , hotel receptionist and ' middle man ' @entity73 , has now admitted lying under oath during a previous case			0
the hotel worker , who has been granted immunity in exchange for giving evidence , admitted doing so in the 2012 trial of fellow hijacker @entity81 - who died in jail of a brain tumour last month			0
' you lied in the @entity86 ? ' , prosecutor @entity84 asked earlier this month			0
' that ’s correct , ' he replied			0
mr @entity6 , who is the chairman of the @entity13 law society 's @entity90 and @entity89 , added : ' the court can look at the credibility of the witnesses - whether their evidence has been so poor it can not be relied on			1
' certainly a strong case can be made out that the three main witnesses have given very poor evidence			0
' the main problem is you are dealing with witnesses who are accomplices so you must treat the evidence with caution			0
the last of the accomplice witnesses has already admitted lying previously			0
' if the case is dismissed it would happen after all the prosecution evidence - which many expect to end this week			1
@entity2 's lawyers have declined to confirm whether they plan to make the application under section 174 of the @entity111			2
for it to succeed the judge would have to be convinced there is not enough evidence for a ' reasonable person ' to convict @entity2 , mr @entity6 said			2
that would be a tougher test for @entity2 's lawyers than leaving it to ' beyond reasonable doubt ' - but would save him from taking the stand			1
' how 's he going to be called as a witness ? ' said mr @entity6			2
' there 's the problem of his health - he 's in a very fragile emotional state			0
it 's quite something to get into that witness box '			0
' riddled with inconsistencies ' : mr @entity6 criticised the evidence of driver @entity64 ( above ) , who was jailed for @entity59 's murder			1
' the main problem is you are dealing with witnesses who are accomplices , ' he added questioned : convicted hitman @entity65 ( left and right ) also gave evidence for the state couple : @entity2 ( left ) has denied arranging the murder of his wife @entity59 ( right ) in @entity142 in 2010 he added previously : ' although it is not down to him to prove his innocence , a judge can choose to draw conclusions from the fact that an accused chooses not to give evidence in his own defence			1
' the prosecution case was dealt a previous blow when evidence of @entity2 's bisexuality was ruled irrelevant			2
presiding judge @entity154 ruled she would exclude much of the testimony of three key witnesses - including the ' @entity157 ' gay fetish escort paid by @entity2 , 34			2
she said that @entity2 's gay affairs despite his conservative @entity161 background were not enough of a motive for murder - and besides , he had already disclosed his sexuality at the start of the case			1
anniversary : the trial was adjourned as @entity59 's father @entity169 visited the place of her death mr @entity6 's is not the first warning that the case could collapse			1
last month the judge had to warn reporters after @entity2 suffered a ' panic attack ' outside court as photographers allegedly surrounded his car and banged his window with their lenses			0
judge @entity154 told reporters : ' we want to see justice done and incidents like that mean that justice may not be done '			0
she added that the media should ' treat the accused and the case with the necessary dignity '			0
@entity2 denies five charges relating to the death of his new bride @entity59 almost four years ago during their honeymoon to @entity13			1
the state alleges he plotted her murder by recruiting a taxi driver to organise two hitmen to kill and rob her in a fake carjacking worth £ 850 ( @entity200 , 000 )			0
the driver , @entity64 – who spent his sixth day on the stand – is the only state witness whose evidence directly implicates @entity204 - based @entity2 in his @entity207 wife 's death in november 2010			1
but during gruelling cross-examination , @entity2 's defence team managed to blast a number of holes in @entity64 's story , highlighting discrepancies between his evidence from the witness box and his statement to police a week after mrs @entity217 suffered a fatal gun shot wound to the neck			2
@entity220 , who heads the defence team , also highlighted that the taxi driver received a substantially lower jail term for his role in the killing in exchange for implicating @entity2 in the murder			0
the trial in @entity142 adjourned for the day on thursday so @entity59 's family could grieve on the fourth anniversary of her death			1
grief etched on their faces , her parents @entity233 and @entity234 and brother @entity235 made a pilgrimage to the township street where her body was found slumped in an abandoned car			0
they were led in prayer by a @entity161 priest as sympathetic onlookers began singing hymns , while passing buses slowed down to watch			0
solemn : @entity217 's parents and brother prayed at the spot where her body was found four years ago tribute : the case of @entity217 ( above ) has featured several times in the @entity13 court system			1

expert said @entity2 more likely than ever to try and have case dismissed
@entity7 's @entity6 added case is ' riddled with inconsistencies '
application could be made without 34 - year - old even taking the stand
@entity2 denies charges relating to @entity59 's death four years ago this week
