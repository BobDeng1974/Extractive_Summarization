the millionaire real - estate heir and murder defendant was arrested on saturday at the @entity9 , where cops found the gun and marijuana stashed in his room			2
@entity15 , 32 , a doorman at the @entity16 and @entity17 said @entity0 approached him just before midnight on friday			1
@entity0 spent the night before his arrest wandering around @entity3 ' @entity2 with his loaded .38 - caliber revolver in his pocket , claims a nightclub doorman ' i asked him to come into the club , but he said in a female - ish soft voice , " i would like to come in , but i ca n't right now , " ' @entity15 told the @entity23			1
@entity0 , 71 , then pulled open his brown - tweed suit jacket to reveal the butt of the gun in a belt holster , @entity15 said			1
' i thought to myself , i hope this old guy with a gun does n't do anything stupid			2
' @entity15 said that ' the whole exchange took less than a minute ' outside the club and @entity0 ' just stumbled a little as he walked down the block			1
' ' i just thought he was an old man who was a little bit off			0
i kept thinking this old guy is on too much prescription medication			0
' @entity0 , 71 , was arrested on the eve of sunday 's final episode of ' @entity39 : the life and deaths of @entity0 , ' and he agreed on monday to face trial for the murder of @entity44 , who had vouched for him in public after his wife vanished			1
the final episode ended with the whispered words of @entity0 recorded in an unguarded moment in a bathroom			1
you 're caught ! ' @entity0 whispered before the sound of water running can be heard			1
' what the hell did i do ? killed them all , of course			0
' @entity15 , 32 , a doorman at the @entity16 and @entity17 said @entity0 revealed to him that he was carrying a weapon the whispered words of @entity0 recorded in an unguarded moment in a bathroom could come back to haunt him - or help him - as he faces a murder charge now those words could come back to haunt him — or help him — as he faces his murder charge			1
a possible move by prosecutors to introduce the incriminating material from a six - part documentary on his strange life and connection to three killings could backfire as interview footage did in the @entity78 molestation trial and the @entity80 murder case			2
in both cases , the defense was allowed under the ' doctrine of completeness ' to provide segments of interviews that presented their clients favorably without subjecting them to tough cross-examination			0
' i submit that @entity80 did n't have to testify and @entity78 did n't have to testify because the prosecution foolishly wanted to introduce portions of their interviews , ' said attorney @entity93 , who represented both men			0
' they just got greedy			0
they were mesmerized by portions they thought could help them			0
' in the @entity78 case , the defense used unaired footage to counter damage done by @entity104 , a damning documentary in which @entity78 held hands with his accuser and spoke of letting children into his bed			0
' i 'd slit my wrists before i 'd hurt a child , ' @entity78 said in one outtake shown by the defense , according to @entity93 , who won the performer 's acquittal 10 years ago			0
@entity78 's lead defense attorney @entity93 said the so - called incriminating material from the @entity0 documentary could backfire as interview footage did in the @entity78 molestation trial in 2005 in the @entity0 case , prosecutors could seek to play portions from @entity39 that concluded with the eccentric millionaire off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live			1
he has been charged in @entity128 with first - degree murder in the 2000 killing @entity44 , the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared in @entity135 in 1982			2
@entity0 , 71 , who is estranged from a family that has a real estate empire worth an estimated $ 4 billion , has long denied killing @entity44 and @entity139 , who was declared dead even though her body was never found			2
investigators had reopened that case and planned to speak with @entity44 when she was shot once in the back of her head at her home near @entity146			0
after the killing , @entity0 disguised himself as a mute woman and moved into a cheap @entity149 , @entity150 , boarding house where he killed an elderly neighbor in 2001			2
he claimed self - defense and was acquitted of murder but convicted of unlawfully disposing of the man 's body , which was found chopped up and floating in @entity156			1
actor @entity80 , left , talks with his attorney , @entity157 : prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with @entity162 because it contradicted other evidence while legal experts said @entity0 's remarks off - camera and to filmmakers during the production will most likely be admissible , prosecutors will have to decide if they outweigh the possibility that the defense would play other portions of interviews showing him denying any killing			1
' i would see this moment of unguarded truth as worth a lot of those denials , ' said @entity181 , a former prosecutor and professor at @entity183			0
' the flat out meaning of the statement is very clear on its face			0
' in the case of @entity80 , prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with @entity162 because it contradicted other evidence			0
the defense then successfully pushed to bring in the rest of the interview			0
' it did a great deal both to humanize him and so he was n't just seen as a celebrity , ' said @entity157 , who won @entity80 's acquittal on a murder charge involving the killing of his wife			1
' there was an image projected that a lot of people had about @entity0 as a difficult person			2
in this video , he came across as a very sympathetic person			0
' prosecutors are not commenting on the @entity44 case while @entity0 is still held in @entity213 , where he also faces firearms charges .			1

@entity0 spent the night before his arrest wandering around @entity3 ' @entity2 with his loaded .38 - caliber revolver in his pocket
a nightclub doorman has recalled a *conversation* with @entity0 where he said he could n't come in the club , before he stumbled off down the street
@entity15 , 32 , a doorman at the @entity16 and @entity17 said @entity0 revealed to him that he was carrying a weapon
@entity0 's apparent whispered *confession* on @entity228 could come back to haunt him — or help him — as he faces his murder charge
