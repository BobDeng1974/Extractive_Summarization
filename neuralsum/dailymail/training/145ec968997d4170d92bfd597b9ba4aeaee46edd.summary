a @entity1 school which claims it could face closure for failing to invite imams and other religious leaders to take assemblies has urged the government to revise controversial ‘ @entity9 values ’ rules			1
@entity10 has been told by @entity11 it is not adequately meeting the ‘ spiritual , moral , social and cultural development ’ of pupils			1
this is because it is not ‘ actively ’ promoting other faiths in the wake of the @entity19 scandal in @entity20 , by asking different religious representatives to lead lessons and assemblies			1
@entity24 , chairman of governors at the small , co-educational independent school in @entity27 , has now written to @entity28 , @entity29 , appealing for the new regulations to be reviewed			2
@entity10 claims it could face closure for failing to invite imams and other religious leaders to take assemblies ( picture posed by models ) he claims that the school ’s aims are being undermined and it will be prevented in future from ‘ teaching in accordance with our @entity1 foundation ’			1
the school is backed by the national religious liberty charity , the @entity46			0
it has already warned that the new rules intended to combat extremism are having ‘ disturbing consequences ’ for religious schools and forcing @entity11 inspectors to act in a way which undermines their ethos			1
in november , @entity11 inspectors described the school ’s provision for pupils ’ spiritual , moral , social and cultural development as ‘ excellent ’			1
they said pupils were ‘ well prepared for life in modern , multicultural , democratic @entity9 society through the teaching of the @entity1 principle to ' love thy neighbour ' ’			2
this summer , the school , which has fees of £ 11,880 - a - year , applied to the @entity68 to extend its age range to include pupils from nine to 11			0
as a result , it was re-inspected by @entity11 in october			0
in his letter , mr @entity24 claimed the inspection focused predominantly on revised @entity75 regarding spiritual , moral , social and cultural development			1
this included whether the school could demonstrate evidence of actively promoting ‘ the fundamental @entity9 values of democracy , the rule of law , individual liberty , and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs ’			1
he said : ‘ we understand that the revised standards only came into force on 29 september and are held out as the government ’s response to radicalism and extremism			0
’ this issue ‘ dominated ’ the inspector ’s questions and ‘ at no point were any questions asked about other aspects of the curriculum or the quality of teaching assessed through lesson observations ’			0
mr @entity24 continued : ‘ in expressing doubt over the school ’s continued existence , the inspector stated : that representatives of other faiths should be invited to lead assemblies and lessons in order for the school to demonstrate compliance with the standards			2
’ the school was also told , that in order to comply with the new regulations , it should ‘ actively ’ promote other faiths , and the principles of the @entity120			1
this meant not stating ‘ certain lifestyles are wrong ’ or promoting a ‘ particular lifestyle ’			0
mr @entity24 said : ‘ from november 2013 to october 2014 the school has continued the same provision for pupils ’ spiritual , moral , social and cultural development which @entity11 adjudged excellent in november 2013			1
‘ yet , immediately following the introduction of the revised school standards , the school is threatened with the prospect of closure			0
we can not understand how such a change in thinking can take place within a year			0
‘ it is an explicit aim of ours to encourage pupils to serve and respect other people , appreciate different cultures and ideas and equip them for life in society			0
‘ but the comments made by @entity11 , as a result of the new regulations , undermine our aims and would prevent us from teaching in accordance with our @entity1 foundation			2
’ mr @entity24 added : ‘ we are therefore extremely concerned about where the new school standards leave the protections afforded by the @entity120 and our school ’s charitable objects as established in the deed trust			2
’ the school has been told by @entity11 it is not adequately meeting the ‘ spiritual development ’ of pupils			1
pictured , @entity11 chief , sir @entity159 the school , which aims to ‘ provide each pupil with a @entity163 understanding ’ has received an ‘ advice note ’ from @entity11 , confirming it ‘ does not meet the new requirements ’			1
but @entity166 , deputy director of @entity46 , said the law ‘ has long respected the ability of religious schools to prioritise the teaching of their own faith ’			0
he said : ‘ in this case , a @entity1 school , with @entity1 teachers and a @entity1 ethos - paid for by @entity1 parents - is being told they should have other religious leaders come in and lead collective worship			0
‘ @entity1 families would simply not want to subject their children to that			0
’ he added ‘ what we need , is to go back to the drawing board to actually talk to stakeholders , talk to faith schools , find out where they ’re coming from and come up with a set of proposals which do n’t require them to promote beliefs which profoundly go against their own			2
’ in june , the government launched a consultation on proposed new @entity75			0
this stated that schools ‘ most actively promote ’ fundamental @entity9 values , ‘ including furthering tolerance and harmony between different cultural traditions and encouraging respect for democracy			1
it added : ‘ a minimum approach , for example putting up posters on a notice board and organising an occasional visit to places of worship would fall short of ‘ actively promoting ’			1
‘ schools will be expected to focus on , and be able to show how their work with pupils is effective in embedding fundamental @entity9 values			0
’ an @entity11 spokeswoman said last night : ‘ the independent school standards are set by the @entity68			1
‘ inspectors must check that independent schools follow these			0
the standards have been strengthened since this school was previously inspected in november 2013			0
‘ one of @entity222 ’s inspectors to visited the school at the request of the @entity68 and found it had further work to do to prepare pupils for life in modern @entity9			2
‘ @entity11 did not threaten the school with closure and has no powers to close schools			2
’ ‘ if the school is concerned about the conduct of an inspector or that an inspection is faulty , it should follow @entity11 's formal machinery for raising those concerns			1
the department will consider the @entity11 report when we receive it			0

@entity10 said to be failing new ' @entity19 ' requirements
not meeting ‘ spiritual , moral , social and cultural development ’ of pupils
@entity11 say they must ‘ actively ’ promote other faiths to comply
but @entity27 school says new rules combating extremism are ' disturbing '
