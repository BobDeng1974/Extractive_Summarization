by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:05 pm on 4th august 2011 war speech : @entity3 calls on security researchers at the @entity6 hacker conference to prevent further cyber attacks a former director of the @entity10 's @entity9 has warned of an imminent ' code war ' where hackers target technology that runs real - world infrastructure such as power stations and water plants			1
@entity3 pointed to last year 's @entity17 computer worm , which some researcher 's think was designed to attack @entity21 's nuclear facilities , as a sign of things to come			1
@entity24 , once seen as college prank , has now moved into ' physical destruction of a national resource ' , he said			1
' i do n't necessarily understand how this ( @entity17 ) was executed , but the important points are that it was really expensive , so a nation - state had to be involved			2
' @entity3 was speaking yesterday as it firm @entity32 claimed to have uncovered one of the largest - ever cyber attacks - a five - year campaign which targeted 72 organisations			1
somewhat fittingly , @entity3 's keynote talk at the @entity6 hacker conference at @entity39 , @entity40 , was interrupted by real - world alarm and flashing lights			1
@entity45 , please , ' a robotic woman 's voice said repeatedly as @entity3 smiled , apparently confused			1
' we are currently investigating the alarm signal you are hearing			0
' after a pause and some laughs from the audience , @entity3 kept going			1
' this is a very delicate window into our future , ' he told the hackers			0
' cold war , global war on terrorism and now you have the code war - which is your war			2
' coincidence ? the @entity6 hacker conference , held at @entity39 , @entity40 ( pictured ) , was interrupted by an alarm - just as mr @entity3 was warning against cyber attacks on real - world targets it 's unclear what caused the alarm - whether it was planned to help make @entity3 's point , was an accident or the result of a hack			1
security firms , the @entity72 and the @entity73 are among 72 organisations targeted in a five - year campaign of cyber attacks , it experts @entity32 have claimed			1
@entity32 will not say who it thinks may be responsible , but there is speculation it could be @entity81			0
last month , the @entity82 admitted it lost 24,000 files of sensitive data in march in a cyber attack by a foreign government			2
@entity87 , the @entity88 deputy secretary of defence , said the data was taken from the computers of a corporate defence contractor			0
he said the @entity88 government had a ' pretty good idea ' who was responsible , but did not elaborate			0
many cyber-attacks in the past have been blamed on @entity81			0
but @entity96 has always denied any state involvement in cyber-attacks , branding the allegations ' groundless '			0
@entity6 is a computer security conference attended by thousands of hackers			2
one @entity6 spokeswoman said alarms happen every year at the event , but she 's not sure what causes them			2
another said it was n't a hack			0
' with over 6,500 people in here , it 's hard to control who pulls the alarm , ' @entity110 wrote in an e-mail			0
in any event , @entity3 's siren - punctuated words carry weight , since he 's credited with warning the @entity88 government about a september 11 - type terrorist attack in august 2001			1
@entity3 recalled the moment he told defense officials about the threat of @entity126 - and compared that moment to his @entity6 talk			1
officials should be more concerned about a cyber attack , he added			2
' people say , " were you surprised when 9/11 took place ? " and i can tell you neither myself nor my people in counterterrorism were surprised at all			0
' instead , it was a strange validation of what we had anticipated had indeed taken place			0
' in the technology world , you may face similar issues in the future			0
' far - reaching : a graphic showing a breakdown of @entity32 's findings into one of the biggest series of cyber attacks ever known he left the talk on an optimistic note , calling on security researchers in the audience to work to prevent such attacks			1
' we 're all in this together - and we 're counting on you , ' he said			0
@entity3 spent 28 years working for the @entity10 and was appointed director of the agency â€™s @entity159 in 1999 and co-ordinator for counterterrorism for the @entity163			1
is nowhere safe ? even the @entity82 ( pictured ) was targeted when a foreign government stole 24,000 sensitve files in a hacking attack			0

cyber crime moving into ' physical destruction ' of national resources , @entity3 claims
he calls on security *boffins* to prevent further attacks
fears raised as it firm uncovers five - year cyber onslaught against 72 organisations
