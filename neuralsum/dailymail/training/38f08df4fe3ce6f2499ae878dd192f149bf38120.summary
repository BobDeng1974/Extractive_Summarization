widow : @entity16 stands to collect $ 635,000 in benefits and possibly millions more for the death of her firefighter husband the appeals court said more expert testimony on this issue is needed as the only such testimony presented was an affidavit by one of @entity10 's doctors , who wrote that she was medically and psychologically female as a result of her compliance with the standards of care adopted by the @entity163			1
the three - judge panel also wrote that changes made in 2009 to the @entity166 that allowed transgendered people to use proof of their sex change to get a marriage license legislatively overruled a previous court decision that had been used as legal precedent in such cases			1

a @entity1 appeal court overturned a decision to void the marriage of @entity10 and her late husband @entity22
a judge originally ruled that because @entity10 is transgender , the marriage was a same - sex marriage
@entity1 does recognize same sex marriages
@entity22 , a *volunteer* firefighter , died fighting a blaze in 2010
the case was brought by @entity22 's first wife , who argued her *children* with @entity22 should get the $ 635,000 death benefits and not @entity10
the widow of a firefighter is entitled to the money
the case will now center on what @entity10 's legal sex is
a separate case that alleges a faulty light was responsible for the fire that killed @entity22 could be worth millions more *dollars*
