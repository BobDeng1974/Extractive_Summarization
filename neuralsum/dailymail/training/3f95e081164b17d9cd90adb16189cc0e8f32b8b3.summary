the @entity0 and @entity1 are now fighting alongside one another in a bid to counter the growing threat @entity5 poses in the @entity6			1
military expert @entity7 believes the latest set of aircraft to be delivered to @entity10 is @entity1 , despite steps being taken to mask its origin			1
the @entity0 has just announced it 's sending an additional 300 troops to @entity10 , raising its total presence in the war - ravaged country to 750			1
those troops will now be working alongside the newly delivered @entity1 fighter jets to form an unlikely international military aid package			1
the aircraft pictured in the footage have several key differences to @entity25 aircraft of the same type the serial numbers on the aircraft pictured correspond to numbers on known @entity1 fighter jets @entity7 also said the aircraft 's camouflage scheme was unique from other known militaries attempts to conceal imagery were visible - here the colours of the @entity1 flag can be seen @entity7 , an analyst for the @entity40 's @entity39 publication , said new footage showed @entity10 's latest @entity43 attack aircraft originated from @entity1			1
their arrival follows a delivery of identical aircraft from @entity25 - but with a number of key distinctions			2
he said video footage of the fleet showed serial numbers matching those from known @entity1 aircraft , while their camouflage scheme was unique and attempts to conceal @entity1 insignia were noticeable			2
' although these aircraft were likely delivered to @entity10 by @entity1 pilots , it is unclear who will now be responsible for crewing and maintaining them			1
' given this recent apparent growth in their su - 25 inventory , it seems increasingly unlikely that @entity10 retains the capacity to operate this type of aircraft in any significant number without some level of external support			0
' whilst the presence of @entity1 - sourced aircraft in @entity10 is clearly significant , the exact circumstances surrounding their presence and intended use remain unknown , as does the existence of any wider arrangement between the governments of these neighboring countries to counter the @entity5 threat			2
' @entity10 has been vocal in its opposition to @entity5 , with public protests held in the capital last week and new reports of drone strikes taking place across its border			0
protests took place in @entity91 , @entity1 , last week where the public voiced its concerns about @entity5 - it is believed @entity1 has now supplied fighter jets to assist the @entity10 government to repel the @entity98 extremists a map shows the areas @entity5 aims to include in its caliphate , which include @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 only days ago did @entity5 formally announced the creation of its caliphate , or @entity107 , across the territory it holds in @entity108 and @entity10			2
its push across @entity10 in recent weeks has been brutal , with more than 2,400 people killed in the month of june alone			0
the group is responsible for committing a number of mass executions and bloody atrocities during its surge to the edge of the city of @entity118 and has called on all muslims to join its campaign			0
yesterday , the leader of the extremist group called on @entity119 to come to the territory his group has seized to help build an @entity98 state , declaring : ' the earth is @entity127 's			0
' @entity128 said : ' in this virtuous month or in any other month , there is no deed better than jihad in the path of @entity127 , so take advantage of this opportunity and walk the path of you righteous predecessors			0
' so to arms , to arms , soldiers of the @entity98 , fight , fight			0
