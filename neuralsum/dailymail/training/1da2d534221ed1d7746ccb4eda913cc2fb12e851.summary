by @entity0 published : 11:14 est , 7 january 2013 updated : 14:06 est , 7 january 2013 @entity1 is turning to a @entity3 style drama in a bid to save her ailing tv network			1
the chat show queen has commissioned @entity7 to produce an hour - long drama called @entity9 and @entity10 which strongly echoes the hit @entity12 series			1
@entity7 ’s show will supposedly ‘ focus on the dynamics and secrets of the wealthy @entity17 family and of the family of their maid , @entity19			2
she has since admitted the company is ' bleeding money ' and has now commissioned six new shows in attempt to boost the network it is based on the play he wrote of the same name which has already toured the @entity34 to critical and commercial success			1
commissioning @entity7 is part of an attempt by @entity1 to remake own after it failed to take off and lost her a reported $ 330m			1
in one interview she even admitted that she might have to shut down her beloved @entity40 because she is ‘ bleeding money ’			1
whilst @entity42 is an upstairs downstairs drama like @entity3 , which has just begun its third season on @entity12 , there are a number of differences			1
@entity47 is set in @entity48 in the early @entity49 , whilst @entity9 is set in the modern day and is about a black family in the @entity34			0
according to the play ’s website it is a ‘ powerful story of love and honor told with honesty and brutal truth ’			0
the @entity59 has described it as ‘ another romp through the melodrama of @entity64 - @entity34 life ’			0
blazing a trail : the @entity3 series has been a huge hit for @entity12			1
now @entity1 is looking to a similar show to boost her struggling network it said : ‘ the proverbial @entity71 are preoccupied with their superficial priorities , until they have to take a look at life on the other side of the tracks			2
powerhouse songs and slapstick comedy round out things			0
’ the other shows @entity80 will work on will be another @entity7 project called @entity83 , a sitcom set in a diner , and a documentary called @entity87 about a struggling school in @entity89			1
raising @entity90 will be a about a comedian bringing up a baby whilst @entity92 is the working title for a show about a retired gangster who becomes a dog groomer			0
golden sisters will be about three pensioners who run a hair salon			0
@entity100 , president of @entity80 , told the @entity101 : ‘ it 's exciting for us			0
it 's our first step into scripted programming			0
’ @entity80 launched in january 2011 but has been such a struggle that @entity1 has said in hindsight she might not have bothered at all			1
helping hand : @entity1 has turned to @entity7 ( left ) to produce the new show , called @entity9 and have nots after its blockbuster opening week which saw one million people tune in , ratings tumbled and sank to 300,000 in prime time and 150,000 in the day			1
@entity1 was forced to lay off 150 members of staff and personally decided to cancel @entity119 ’s nightly talk show , the @entity118 , because of poor viewing figures			2
chief executive @entity121 and another senior boss stepped down and @entity1 herself was forced to assume overall control			2
in an interview in august 2011 @entity1 admitted @entity80 was ‘ not where i want it to be ’ and that it had to get better			2
she also begged audiences to wait before making their minds up and asked for a grace period - of three whole years			0
things appear to have been finally turning around more recently and average audiences increased to 328,000 in december last year , a rise of 28 per cent on the year before			0
that however is well below rivals like @entity134 which regularly gets 900,000 viewers or @entity136 which draws in one million			0
adding to her woes , @entity1 , 58 , recently revealed that she had a breast cancer scare in front of a group of 5,000 devotees at @entity40 ’s annual conference in @entity144 .			2

@entity1 admits her network is ' bleeding money ' and that with hindsight she might not have bothered with the project at all
she has commissioned @entity7 to produce a upstairs downstairs drama , *inspired* by hit series @entity3 , called @entity42
