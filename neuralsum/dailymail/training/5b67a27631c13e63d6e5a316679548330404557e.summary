@entity1 governments have historically taken an approach to the so - called ‘ war on terror ’ that has been distinctly un-british – crude , heavy - handed , careless of innocent people ’s liberties , and as a result often counterproductive			1
yet our response to the flood of @entity11 that has left these shores to fight in @entity14 and subsequently @entity15 for an @entity17 caliphate has been tentative , uncertain , almost limp			2
the brutal , ritualised public murder of @entity19 has crystallised the psychopathic nature of what these young @entity1 have signed up to and in some cases actively promoted			1
yet the home secretary ’s response as recently as yesterday seemed lacking in both focus and urgency			2
asbos for terrorists ? it is hard to imagine is killers quaking in their boots over that			2
so why have we done so little so far ? we should target the young men who have rushed to take up arms on behalf of @entity44 , an organisation that purports to be a state – and a hostile one at that			1
it is astonishing to me that this action alone is viewed as legal , let alone what they do once there			1
imagine that in my youth during the @entity54 , i had gone off to join the @entity55 with the intent of taking action against @entity58 , or that my father had gone to join the @entity60 in the @entity61			1
those actions would quite properly have been viewed as treason			1
what these young men have done is worse			1
remember that in this day and age even conventional ‘ legal ’ wars are essentially industrialised murder			0
civil wars , and the sort of sectarian conflict we are seeing in @entity15 and @entity14 , are even worse , littered with the self - righteous sadism that we saw in the death of @entity19			0
they are wars without rules			0
the barbarism we saw in the murder of @entity19 has been replicated time and again against thousands of innocent @entity15 and @entity14			0
beheadings , crucifixions , burials alive have all been carried out against people guilty of no crime , largely for the purpose of feeding the is propaganda machine			0
these young men are going to @entity14 to take part in large - scale murder for an organisation with a $ 2 billion income from extortion , blackmail and theft			2
so if it is not illegal already – hard to believe – let us make it so			0
going abroad to fight and kill for a cause hostile to @entity1 and its @entity58 allies should be against @entity1 law and should carry a very heavy sentence			1
but i would go further than that			0
since these young men are in effect swearing allegiance to a hostile state , they should all forfeit their @entity1 citizenship – not just those who are dual nationals			1
since this is an incredibly serious penalty , it should be done only after a proper public trial carrying all the public seriousness and opprobrium of a murder trial , because in many cases that is what it would be			1
@entity24 believes by stripping their citizenship turns the ' brief and violent holiday ' to a life sentence as the home secretary reiterated yesterday , lawyers would say you can not render someone stateless			1
@entity131 lawyers have been wrong before			0
democracies have a right to defend themselves			0
@entity44 is claiming to be a state			0
they can issue these young men with @entity139 passports if they so wish			2
it is not our problem that they would have trouble getting into any civilised country with them			0
neither will it be our problem any more if @entity27 ceases to exist			0
we must face head - on the paradox that these men can burn their @entity1 passports on tv and deny their legal allegiance to @entity1 , yet our nation can not say to them , in effect : ‘ ok , never come back			1
’ the result would be that these young men would suddenly find their trip to @entity14 is no longer a short violent holiday but a life sentence to the lifestyle they claim to espouse , complete with @entity165 law and a desert climate			2
we are at a moment of decision			0
we can change or clarify @entity1 law to make the evil actions of these young men illegal and to make the penalty fit the crime : expulsion from the society they claim to reject			1
we can do this in @entity1 courts and in doing so proclaim to the world that we are a tolerant society , but that we will not tolerate sadism and murder in the name of religion			1
or we can fail to grasp the nettle , let some of these murderers back and try to deal with the subsequent problems			0
this will allow some of these men to put their new ‘ skills ’ to further ill use , with potentially terrible consequences for our countrymen , resulting in ethnic suspicion and the social poison that will flow from that .			2

@entity24 claims during @entity61 these actions would be treason
he said @entity1 should strip these men of their citizenship *due* to their action
*mr* @entity24 claimed that this should only happen though after a public trial
