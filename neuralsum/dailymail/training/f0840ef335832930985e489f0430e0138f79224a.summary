by @entity1 reporter and @entity3 reporter published : 10:16 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 11:57 est , 31 october 2013 government safety rules are changing to let airline passengers use most electronic devices from gate - to-gate			1
the change will let passengers read , work , play games , watch movies and listen to music at any time during flight instead what is often just a brief cruising period between take - off and descent			1
the @entity19 says airlines can allow passengers to use the devices during takeoffs and landings on planes that meet certain criteria for protecting aircraft systems from electronic interference			1
it 's a miracle ! the @entity19 has finally lifted rules that ban the use of electronic devices during take - off and landing rules still apply : there are stipulations , of course , and the roll - out time will vary between airlines , but with only ' very limited exception ' most new airliners are expected to meet the criteria ' with very limited exception ' but changes wo n't happen immediately			1
so why the change of heart ? the @entity19 is n't saying complaints spurred the decision , per se , and instead uses the term ' input			1
' stow this ! passengers will soon be allowed to watch movies , read ebooks , and play games on their gadgets from gat - to-gate			1

other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems , and most of those reports are very old			0
however , the committee recommended the @entity19 allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument landings in low visibility			1
a travel industry group welcomed the changes , calling them common - sense accommodations for a traveling public now bristling with technology			2
