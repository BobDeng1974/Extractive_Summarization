by @entity0 last updated at 11:21 am on 11th october 2011 the extent of the @entity3 ’s reliance on the @entity4 to prop up the economy was laid bare by official figures yesterday			2
they showed that only two areas in the north of @entity10 and one in the @entity11 could match the wealth creation per worker of @entity14 and the @entity4			1
and only four of @entity17 ’s towns and cities and one in @entity19 could do so			2
the @entity11 area is the @entity22 suburb of @entity23 , while the two in the north are @entity26 and @entity27			0
wealth creation was measured using a complicated formula taking into account the amount of the nation ’s gdp created per region , the number of workers there and the number of hours they work			0
it excluded the effects of unemployment , so only measured the value of those in work			0
the analysis by the @entity46 concluded : ‘ the highest productivity levels are found in inner @entity14 , with productivity in @entity49 56 per cent above @entity3 average and @entity51 33 per cent above @entity3 average			1
’ @entity4 props up economy : only two areas in the north of @entity10 and one in the @entity11 could match the wealth creation per worker of @entity14 and the @entity4			1
( data from the @entity46 ) the analysis found that the highest productivity levels are found in inner @entity14 economist @entity58 , of the @entity59 , said : ‘ there is no doubt that workers in the south are supporting those in the rest of the country			1
’ and @entity67 , of @entity69 think - tank the @entity70 and @entity71 , said : ‘ other regions have a high dependence on public sector spending			0
’ people working in @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 also brought in productivity returns that put their value at more than 15 per cent above average			1
the new official demonstration of the concentration of wealth creation in @entity14 and the @entity4 was published in the wake of the latest @entity87 attempt to cream off profits from the @entity69 and financial industries			1
lower levels of productivity : wealth creation was measured using a complicated formula taking into account the amount of the nation 's gdp created per region , the number of workers there and the number of hours they work worst - performing : bottom of the pile for worker productivity per hour was @entity108 the transactions tax proposed by @entity111 president @entity110 would fall heavily on @entity10 , with finance industries in the south of @entity10 paying up to 70 per cent of the tax proceeds across @entity87			1
profits generated in southern @entity10 already heavily subsidise life in the rest of the country : most other regions are dependent on taxes paid in the south , and three have economies in which 60 per cent of all spending is provided by the state			0
the @entity46 analysis examined gross value added per hour worked – the amount of wealth generated by a worker every hour in 2008 , the first full year of the recession			2
the method eliminates the effects of unemployment and worklessness and measures only the value produced by those who are actually in jobs			0
the worst - performing areas were largely rural or tourist regions and depressed cities			0
bottom of the pile for worker productivity per hour was @entity108 , 67 per cent of average , followed by @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151			1
the lowest - place major city was the northern side of @entity154 : @entity155 returned 83 per cent of average productivity			2
in @entity17 just four areas : @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 , and @entity162 , were above average			0
@entity164 and the @entity165 of @entity166 were the only part of @entity19 to top the average .			0

highest productivity levels are found in inner @entity14
bottom of the pile for worker productivity is @entity108
