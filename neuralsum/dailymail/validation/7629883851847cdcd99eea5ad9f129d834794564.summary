the total wipeout of @entity2 clubs from @entity4 competition this week has led to another feverish debate about where our game stands in relation to our continental counterparts			1
but before we get too down about things , there is still one @entity2 standing in @entity12 this season			0
@entity14 may have crashed out to @entity15 but their on - loan defender @entity16 is still eyeing @entity4 glory with @entity19 side @entity18			1
@entity14 defender @entity16 is currently on loan at @entity22 side @entity18 the 26 - year - old helped @entity18 to knock out @entity24 during the @entity26 round of 32 @entity27 is the only remaining @entity2 player in the squads of the 16 teams remaining in the @entity30 and the @entity26			1
his team produced a stunning performance to beat @entity22 rivals @entity34 3 - 0 in the @entity35 and complete a 4 - 1 aggregate triumph			0
although @entity27 was not involved , he has featured in the @entity26 this season and helped them knock out another @entity40 club , @entity24 , in the round of 32			2
@entity27 , 26 , had fallen out of favour under @entity43 at @entity14 , making just 18 appearances in two seasons and decided to seek greater first - team opportunities in @entity47			2
and while he has not been a mainstay of @entity50 's team , he has made 15 appearances across all competitions , almost certainly more than he would have made at @entity14			0
@entity27 began to find first - team opportunities limited playing for @entity14 and was sent on loan @entity55 international @entity27 has admitted he is uncertain where he will be playing his football next season @entity27 could feature in the latter stages of the competition as @entity18 bid to win their second @entity4 trophy in @entity63 on may 27			1
he has been linked with a move to @entity66 at the end of the season , who are managed by his former @entity14 boss @entity69			0
but @entity27 told @entity70 on wednesday : ' it 's difficult to say [ where i will play ] at the moment			0
every footballer can go to a bigger club on a free contract but for me , i 'm still only 26 and i just want to play every game , that 's what 's important			0
' for now , however , @entity27 is flying the flag solo for @entity55 in @entity4 competition			1
@entity27 has been linked with a move to @entity66 , managed by his former @entity14 boss @entity69			2

all @entity2 clubs have been knocked out of @entity4 competition this season
this leaves @entity16 as the only @entity2 player in the @entity26
@entity27 is currently on loan with @entity18 from @entity14
