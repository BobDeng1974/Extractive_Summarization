by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter a mysterious radiation release that has indefinitely shuttered a nuclear waste dump in @entity5 may have been caused by a change in the type of kitty litter that is mixed with the toxic waste			1
that 's one of the theories that officials are exploring as they investigate the february 14 leak at the @entity14 in southeastern @entity5 that contaminated 21 workers with low levels of radiation			1
@entity18 , a scientist who worked at the facility from 2000 to 2010 , said believes a change from non-organic to organic litter caused a chemical reaction inside a waste drum , releasing the radioactive isotopes			1
mystery leak : the @entity14 near @entity27 , @entity5 , became the site of a radiation leak in february exposed : the radiation release contaminated 21 workers and shuttered the southeastern @entity5 facility three months ago @entity34 secretary @entity33 confirmed to the @entity35 monday that he has heard @entity36 officials discuss the possibility that kitty litter may have been to blame for the radiation leak			1
@entity33 said it is one of many theories and nothing is certain at this time			0
in a statement tuesday , the @entity36 said only that it is investigating ' all possible scenarios			0
' the dump 26 miles east of @entity27 can not take in liquid waste , so kitty litter is used to absorb any fluids before drums of waste are sealed and shipped to the facility , @entity18 said			1
one of a kind : in this march 7 , 2014 photo released the @entity56 @entity36 , specially - trained workers make unmanned tests inside the shuttered @entity27 facility - the nation 's only underground nuclear waste dump the dump is the federal government 's only permanent deep - underground repository for waste from decades of building nuclear bombs from @entity66 and other federal facilities			2
@entity14 recovery manager @entity68 told a town hall meeting last week that after several trips into the half - mile - deep repository , officials believe the radiation leak was likely caused by a chemical reaction in nuclear waste that was mixed with nitrate salt			1
@entity68 said a switch from a non-organic substance to organic was what triggered the event			2
the unidentified substance containing elements mirroring nitrate salt is kitty litter , @entity18 said			1
the @entity36 on tuesday confirmed that any waste with liquid is typically treated with ' an absorbent like kitty litter			1
' ' i 'm just dying to know why this happened and who approved it , because it was a dumb idea , ' @entity18 said			0
' you just ca n't make a change to the procedure without reviewing it			2
' surprise culprit : a scientist believes a change from non-organic to organic kitty litter used to absorb liquid waste caused a chemical reaction this may 10 , 2014 photo provided by the @entity14 shows waste stacks in a storage room with broken magnesium oxide bags and heat damage , seen as black streaks on the rim of the container at center , on top of a standard waste box investigators have said that crews on the latest trip into the mine spotted melted plastic and rubber on some drums and boxes of waste , indicating there was some kind of heat generated in the room where the waste is stored			1
nine days before the release , a truck hauling salt in the mine caught fire			0
but officials have said the fire was far from the waste - handling area and that the events were likely unrelated			0
initial investigations into both accidents have blamed them on poor management , an eroding safety culture , ineffective maintenance and a lack of proper oversight at the 15 - year - old , $ 5billion site			0
the @entity36 's investigation , the results of which were made public late last month , found shortcomings at almost every step , from a more than 10 - hour response to the initial emergency alarm to a bypass in the filtration system that allowed the radiation to escape above ground			0
sub-standard : a preliminary investigation has blamed the accident on poor management and an eroding safety culture ' the bottom line is they failed to believe initial indications of the release , ' board chairman @entity165 said at a town hall meeting april 23			0
@entity36 's report also found that much of the operation failed to meet standards for a nuclear facility ; a lack of proper safety training and emergency planning ; lagging maintenance ; and a lack of strategy for things like the placement of air monitors			2
problems with oversight by the @entity36 also were cited			0
@entity186 , who took over as head of the contractor that runs the plant shortly after the release , acknowledged mistakes by @entity192			0
he also detailed a series of changes in management , training and operations to " assure that every hazard that is posed by @entity14 is examined " and proper safeguards are put in place to make the operation ' a world - class nuclear operation			2

radioactive isotopes were released into the air at @entity14 in february
scientists *suspect* a change from non-organic to organic kitty litter used at the facility to absorbs liquids caused chemical reaction
