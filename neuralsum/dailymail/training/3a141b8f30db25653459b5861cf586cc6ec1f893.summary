by @entity0 @entity1 has suffered with psoriasis since childhood			1
the condition , which causes red , scaly patches of skin , is distressing and can be painful			2
' at its worst , i felt like i 'd been stung by a thousand bees , ' says @entity1 , a 40 - year - old comedian and writer from north @entity11			1
but recently he 's found a surprising treatment that has transformed his symptoms			1
much of his skin used to be covered in flaky patches			2
today , these areas are merely slightly pink and dry			2
@entity1 , 40 , from @entity11 has suffered with psoriasis since childhood and has recently found a treatment the difference is not down to a new ointment but , he says , it 's thanks to a form of talking therapy , known as cognitive behavioural therapy ( @entity26 )			1
' i tried everything - @entity29 medicine , mud from the @entity31 , bathing in lavender , ' says @entity1			1
' but @entity26 has helped massively - i finally feel i 'm in control of my psoriasis			1
' it may seem surprising that a psychological treatment could have such a marked effect on a physical condition , but it is increasingly being used outside the mental health field			1
talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy help people make positive changes to their thinking and behaviour and have been shown to be effective for a range of conditions including skin complaints , gut disorders and chronic pain			1
what is striking is that psychological techniques are actively helping to reduce symptoms , rather than enabling patients to cope with having a long - term condition			1
psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory condition where the skin renews itself too quickly			1
it is thought to be due to a problem with the immune system			2
research has shown @entity26 can reduce its severity , an effect maintained six months on , says dr @entity64 , a specialist psychologist who leads the psychodermatology service at the @entity66 in @entity11 , offering support for conditions ranging from acne to skin cancer			1
psychological techniques are actively helping to reduce symptoms about 60 per cent of psoriasis patients will find stress makes their condition worse , adds dr @entity77 , a consultant dermatologist at the @entity66			1
it 's thought that this may partly be because when stressed , people with psoriasis produce less cortisol - a hormone that reduces inflammation			1
' it 's logical that if stress makes many psoriasis patients worse , modifying your stress response should make it better , ' says dr @entity77			1
@entity1 was bullied at school and says that his psoriasis would flare up as a result			1
he has two or three sessions a month of @entity26 with dr @entity64 , plus twice - monthly injections of an anti-inflammatory drug , and ointments for his arms and scalp			1
the @entity26 sessions have helped to reduce his stress levels by changing unhelpful ways of thinking			2
' i might have a conversation with someone that 's gone perfectly well , then remember something i said that the person did n't seem enthusiastic about and worry about it , ' says @entity1			1
this tendency to fixate on such moments , perceiving them as failures , is known in psychology as catastrophising , in which unnecessary stress is generated			2
' dr @entity64 's very good at offering perspective , such as the person i was talking to may just have been distracted , ' says @entity1			1
much of his stress is generated by psoriasis itself			1
' i was once in a play , which required me to take my top off , ' he says			0
' i heard a bloke in the audience say loudly : " well , i hope that 's not catching			0
" ' in the past , @entity1 would have dwelled on the comment , but @entity26 has given him techniques to get past it			1
since starting sessions with dr @entity64 two years ago , his @entity132 ( @entity132 ) score - which measures the severity of psoriasis - has improved and he is using less @entity136 is also accepted that @entity26 can be an effective treatment for some patients with irritable bowel syndrome ( @entity140 ) , says dr @entity141 , a consultant gastroenterologist at @entity142 , @entity11			1
@entity140 refers to symptoms such as stomach cramps , diarrhoea , constipation and bloating			0
it is estimated to affect up to a third of the population at some point in their lives			0
' we know psychological therapies can work for the symptoms of @entity140 , as they have an effect on the autonomic nervous system , which regulates automatic functions such as digestion , ' says dr @entity141 , who is also the medical director of the gut and liver disease charity , @entity167			0
brain scans of @entity140 patients have shown increased activity in parts of the brain that process messages about pain			0
this appears to be reduced by therapy			2
@entity177 , an 18 - year - old student from @entity178 , developed an irritable bowel last year during a severe case of ulcerative colitis , an inflammation of the colon , which led to him needing the loo up to 20 times a day			2
@entity177 had already been having @entity26 for anxiety and to cope with his colitis			0
when his irritable bowel developed , his phsychologists treated it with @entity26 , too			0
' my therapist looked at things i was doing to give myself more stress , ' he says			0
part of the problem was @entity177 's rigid ideas about how he should look and behave			0
@entity26 helped his accept his condition rather than focus on it his therapist encouraged him to challenge these rules by deliberately breaking them			0
' one of my rules was always to look classy , so instead , when i had my driving theory test i wore tracksuit bottoms , ' he says			0
' @entity26 helped me accept my condition rather than focus on it , and my symptoms have died off			0
' it has been established that talking therapy can help people who suffer with chronic pain			2
@entity212 , 42 , had suffered with a lower back problem for ten years and had struggled to get a clear answer as to what was causing it			2
' i was told i had a prolapsed disc at one point ; another doctor said it was a muscular problem			0
when it 's been bad i 've been either hobbling around or completely unable to move , ' says the mother - of - two			2
last year @entity212 , an administrator from @entity223 , took part in a study comparing the efficacy of contextual cognitive behavioural therapy ( @entity26 ) , a new form of talking therapy that focuses on mindfulness and accepting problems rather than obsessing about them , with physiotherapy in people suffering chronic back pain			1
mindfulness is a meditative technique to develop awareness of the present moment as an antidote to worry			0
@entity212 received eight one - to - one sessions of @entity26 with a psychologist			2
professor @entity243 , a health psychologist at @entity244 , who co-ran the as - yet - unpublished study , described how the therapy is designed to help people who struggle to cope psychologically with a physical condition			1
' they tend to be people with negative thinking styles , ' says professor @entity243			0
tensing up against pain increases it , he adds			0
in her sessions , @entity212 would be asked to close her eyes and focus on the pain			0
' to feel it for what it is , accept it and let it be , ' she says			0
' it 's been amazingly helpful			0
a few weeks ago i had a bad episode with my back			0
whereas before i would probably have lain on the sofa , taken painkillers and worried about the pain , i took my dog for a walk and felt better			0
' @entity212 credits @entity26 for the change in her mindset and is in less pain now			0
' it 's turned my life around , ' she says .			0
