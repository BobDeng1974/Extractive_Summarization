by @entity0 published : 08:56 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 08:56 est , 26 june 2013 yo - yo dieting mother - of - four @entity2 had tried everything to lose weight , even having her jaw wired shut			1
but every slimming technique she used always resulted in her piling back on any weight she had actually lost - in that case , just 3lbs - immediately after			2
so now , having lost and regained a total of 70 stone over 45 years , @entity12 , 62 , from @entity13 in @entity14 , has taken drastic measures and had a gastric band fitted - selling her brand new £ 10,500 car to pay for the irreversible surgery			1
@entity2 - pictured left , now at her 10 stone goal weight , and right , aged 54 and 16 stone - sold her car to pay for gastric band surgery after yo yo dieting for 45 years @entity12 now weighs 10 stone , is a size 10/12 , and is finally happy with her weight after having had gastric band surgery the drastic step paid off and she dropped six stone ( and kept it off ) after her stomach was reduced to the size of a walnut			1
@entity12 , 62 , said : ' i tried every diet going and i 'd lose the weight but i would just pile it all back on again - and some more			1
i spent a fortune on it and one day 18 months ago i woke up and just decided enough was enough			0
' @entity12 told her husband @entity38 she was selling the car and going to have gastric band surgery			2
' people say to me i was brave , ' she said , ' but truly i have reached a point where i was mentally exhausted with dieting			0
i wanted to be fit , i wanted to stop dressing to disguise my body			0
' @entity12 - left , at 14 years old weighing 13 stone , right , aged 19 weighing 11 stone - has been struggling with her weight since she was 10 and suffered a rheumatic fever aged 20 , weighing 10 stone , the weight she is finally back to following her surgery @entity12 first began gaining weight during an eight - month hospital stay after she was struck down by rheumatic fever when she was just ten years old			1
she embarked on her first diet aged 17 , when eating only grapefruit for every meal she lost nine pounds in three weeks			0
at one point the desperate dental hygienist even asked a colleague to wire shut her mouth for three weeks , but lost three pounds after she took to liquidising chocolate bars and drinking them through a straw			2
@entity2 , aged 26 , weighing 15 stone , with one of her baby sons in his christening gown @entity12 - left , aged 53 weighing 11 stone , and right , aged 40 , weighing 15 stone - embarked on her first diet aged 17 , eating only grapefruit for every meal and losing 9lb in three weeks over the years @entity12 tried every diet going , wobbling between ten stone and her highest weight of 16.5 stone			1
she would often lose up to four stone at a time , but a holiday or special occasion would see her weight loss halt , and she would give up all together			2
between diets she would pile on the pounds snacking on cakes and eating meals the same size as those served to her teenage sons and husband			0
and whenever she embarked upon a new diet , @entity12 would gorge her face with fish and chips in preparation for the deprivation ahead			2
at the age of 45 @entity12 weighed 12 stone , but she still found the rest of the weight tricky to keep off @entity2 - here aged 54 , weighing 16 stone - decided 18 months ago that enough was enough , and told her husband she was selling the car @entity2 aged 56 , weighing 11 stone , left , and aged 61 , weighing 15 and a half stone , right so 18 months ago , when she finally gave up , the disheartened slimmer sold her brand new @entity101 for £ 10,500 - the exact cost of her gastric surgery by the @entity104 at the @entity105 in @entity106 , @entity107			1
surgeons shortened her small intestine and stapled off most of her stomach to create a smaller pouch , so @entity12 physically can not eat as much			2
her stomach is the size of a walnut			0
now a svelte size 10/12 , @entity12 weighs 9st 10lbs and says she is finally happier than ever			1
@entity115 and weighing 15 stone - says she believes she 'll really keep the weight off this time @entity2 aged 52 , weighing 15 and a half stone left , aged 56 , weighing 11 stone , and right , aged 48 weighing 10 stone ' for me the surgery has been the most wonderful thing , ' she said			1
i do n't have to think about joining diets , i just eat what i want and every morning i get up and pull on a size 10 or 12 jeans			0
i think it has changed my life			0
it has given me so much more confidence			0
i do n’t have to hide under these baggy clothes anymore , i can wear what i want			0
' my husband @entity38 says i am much happier ... which is good for him			0
