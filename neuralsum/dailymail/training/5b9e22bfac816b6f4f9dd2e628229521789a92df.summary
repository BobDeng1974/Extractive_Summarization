@entity0 has further demonstrated just how serious it is about making computers think like humans			1
the @entity5 tech giant has teamed up with two of @entity8 ’s artificial intelligence ( @entity9 ) teams to help machines better understand users , and improve visual recognition systems using deep learning			1
this partnership follows reports @entity0 is also developing superfast ‘ quantum ’ chips modelled on the human brain , to make searches and software more intuitive			1
@entity0 has teamed up with two of @entity8 ’s ( pictured ) artificial intelligence ( @entity9 ) teams			1
the first will lead research into helping machines better understand users , while the second has been tasked to improve visual recognition systems using deep learning ‘ it is a really exciting time for @entity9 research these days , and progress is being made on many fronts including image recognition and natural language understanding , ’ wrote @entity32 , co-founder of @entity33 and vice president of engineering at @entity0 in a blog post			1
‘ we are delighted to announce a partnership with @entity8 to accelerate @entity0 ’s research efforts in these areas			1
’ @entity33 will be working with two of @entity48 ’s @entity9 research teams			1
professor @entity49 , professor @entity50 , dr @entity51 and dr @entity52 , who teamed up earlier this year to co-found @entity53 , will be leading research to help machines better understand what users are saying to them			1
the acquisition of @entity33 in january was n't @entity0 ’s first foray into artificial intelligence and machine learning			1
its recent @entity64 search update was created to make @entity0 ' more human ' - searches can now understand context , like a human brain , for example			1
its @entity70 app uses ‘ predictive analysis ’ to predict what @entity72 users will do next , before offering relevant help and information at each step without ever being asked			2
@entity0 also hired futurist @entity78 as engineering director in 2012			2
@entity78 has famously claimed that in just over 30 years , humans will be able to upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - an event called singularity			2
he also claimed the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100			0
its partnership with @entity8 follows reports @entity0 is also developing superfast ‘ quantum ’ chips modelled on the human brain , to make searches and software more intuitive			1
also joining the @entity33 team will be dr @entity99 , @entity100 and professor @entity101 , experts in computer vision systems			0
as co-founders of @entity106 , their aim is to improve visual recognition systems using deep learning			1
dr @entity99 and professor @entity101 developed one of the winning systems at the recent 2014 @entity114 competition			0
@entity33 has hired all seven founders of these startups with the three professors holding joint appointments at @entity8 where they will continue to spend part of their time			0
‘ these exciting partnerships underline how committed @entity33 is to supporting the development of @entity124 academia and the growth of strong scientific research labs , ’ continued mr @entity32			0
as a part of the collaboration , @entity33 will be donating to establish a research partnership with the @entity130 and the @entity131 at @entity8			0
‘ we are thrilled to welcome these extremely talented machine learning researchers to the @entity33 team and are excited about the potential impact of the advances their research will bring , ’ concluded mr @entity32			2
@entity0 is also reportedly working on a super-fast ' quantum ' computer chip as part its vision to one day have machines think like humans			1
dr @entity99 , @entity100 and professor @entity101 are among the experts partnering with @entity0			2
dr @entity99 and professor @entity101 developed one of the winning systems at the 2014 @entity114 competition			0
@entity0 's winning entry , which helps computers distinguish between individual objects , is pictured @entity0 is also reportedly working on a super-fast ' quantum ' computer chip as part its vision to one day have machines think like humans			1
the @entity5 - based group has teamed up with leading physicist @entity154 to build processors based on quantum theories , that would potentially work in a similar way to the human brain the @entity5 - based group has teamed up with leading physicist @entity154 to build processors based on quantum theories			1
@entity0 acquired artificial intelligence firm @entity33 in january the new hire is part of a ' hardware initiative ' to design and build chips operating on sub-atomic levels in ways that makes them much faster than existing processors			1
standard computers deal with binary data expressed in zeroes and ones			0
however , quantum computing uses the behaviour of sub-atomic particles to encode data			0
experts believe that a quantum bit , which can have two states at the same time , may be able hugely improve the speed and power of computing			0
professor @entity154 currently works at @entity183 , @entity183 , and is one of the most prolific researchers in the area of artificial intelligence			2
but @entity0 is also aware of the dangers involved with @entity9 and machine learning			1
so much so that in january it set up an ethics board to oversee its work in these fields			0
the ethics board is to ensure the projects are not abused			0
the @entity0 ethics board is set to create a series of rules and restrictions over the use of the technology			2
@entity201 is one of the driving forces behind super-intelligent computers that could improve everything from space travel to electric cars			0
but the @entity208 - founder claims the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons			0
last month , the billionaire tweeted a recommendation for a book that looks at a robot uprising , claiming ‘ we need to be super careful with @entity9			2
potentially more dangerous than nukes			0
’ @entity201 referred to the book ‘ @entity222 , strategies ’ , a work by @entity219 that asks major questions about how humanity will cope with super-intelligent computers			0
mr @entity219 has also argued that the world is fake and we are living in a computer simulation			0
in a later tweet , @entity201 wrote : ‘ hope we 're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence			0
unfortunately , that is increasingly probable			0
’ @entity201 's tweets follows a similar comment in june in which the @entity208 - founder said believes that a horrific ‘ terminator - like ’ scenario could be created from research into artificial intelligence			1
the 42 - year - old is so worried , he is investing in @entity9 companies , not to make money , but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand .			2

@entity0 has teamed up with two of @entity48 ’s artificial intelligence ( @entity9 ) teams
the first will lead research into helping machines better understand users
the second is tasked with improving visual recognition using deep learning
@entity0 bought @entity9 firm @entity257 in january , designed to help computers think like humans
tech giant is also working on quantum chips based on the human brain
