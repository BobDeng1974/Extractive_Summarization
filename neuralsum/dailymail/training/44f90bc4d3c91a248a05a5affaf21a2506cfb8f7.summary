by @entity0 it looks more like a lush green meadow than a popular coastal resort , and with tonnes and tonnes of tangled seaweed lining the shores and floating on the water , would you really want to take a swim ? it seems that nothing will deter these sunseekers from having a fun day in the sun in @entity15			2
these pictures show beachgoers frolicking in swathes of green algae on the beach in @entity21 in the eastern @entity23 province			1
but the algae is likely to do no harm to those swimming in it - it is non poisonous @entity59 , an edible seaweed which is even praised for its health benefits			1
the form of algae , also known as sea lettuce , is said to be rich in magnesium and many other nutrients , a vitamin - rich food source that can help improve skin and lower blood pressure			2
but clean up teams will have to work quickly to clean up the green stuff , before it decomposes and begins to rot - for sea lettuce can produce large quantities of hydrogen sulphide , a toxic gas			2
healthy : not only is the seaweed said to be non-toxic , it is also lauded for its health benefits and is edible is it a bird ? as if swimming in the stuff is n't bad enough , this young swimmer launches a load of seaweed through the air at his friend taking a stroll : you 'd be forgiven for thinking that this woman was walking across a lush meadow , she is in fact ankle deep in algae swathed sea water relaxing : this child looks delighted to be playing in the algae , perhaps because it is good for him as well as being nutritious for humans , the algae is also a source of sustenance for sea creatures including manatees			1
more than 10,000 volunteers helped clear the same coastline back in 2008 when the beach - which was due to host the @entity108 @entity107 sailing events - was swamped by some 20 square miles of algae			1
the government even had to step in to ensure that the @entity21 sailing venue was ready in time for the games , sending in soldiers to help clear it up			1
this particular type of seaweed can grow up to 50cm in length , typically growing near the shore , on rocks or other algae , on open coasts or in estuaries and harbours			0
officials have blamed warm seas for bringing in the algae in the past , but many scientists blame pollution for the phenomenon			0
some experts say that the algae blooms in water with high levels of nutrients blaming farmers using too much fertiliser on their crops and cities falling to treat sewage properly			0
come on in , the water 's lovely : a swimmer 's head pokes through a luscious green surface that resembles a swamp more than a picturesque coast safe and stylish : this women may look as though they are about to rob a bank , but they are in fact just shielding their faces from the glare of the sun staying safe : the nylon masks were invented by a local designer some eight years ago and have become increasingly popular since double benefits : the masks also protect wearers from being stung by jellyfish not only were beachgoers able to reap the rewards of bathing in tonnes of healthy seaweed , but some also went to extreme measures to ensure their skin was n't damaged by the sun. many beach goers donned bizarre looking nylon masks designed to protect wearers from the glare of the sun 's rays so that they do n't have to wear sun cream			1
the masks are the brainchild of a local designer and have become increasingly popular since they were launched around eight years ago			0
the sea port city of @entity21 is famous for its beaches , which are noted for their clear water , mild waves and soft sand			0
the beautiful scenery and their @entity183 feel are also compared to @entity185 , @entity186 or @entity187 in @entity188 .			0

pictures show sun - seekers swimming in green algae on the beach in @entity21 in the eastern @entity23 province
but the algae - *enteromorpha* *prolifera* - is n't toxic , is edible and is even lauded for its health benefits
the beach was cleared by 10,000 volunteers to ensure it was ready in time for sailing events at the @entity203
