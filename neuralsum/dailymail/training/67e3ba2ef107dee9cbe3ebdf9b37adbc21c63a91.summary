now environmentalists are engaged in an ongoing fight with a group of boaters , businesses and conservatives over whether the manatee should have its status changed			2
agency spokesman , @entity35 said : ‘ if we come to the end of this and decide reclassification is warranted , it 's good news because it means the manatee is recovering and no longer on the brink of extinction			1
’ the agency is seeking public comment on its finding that a petition to reclassify the manatee has merits by tuesday			2
a decision on whether a change is warranted wo n't be made until the agency completes its review , which could take a year			2

the animal 's biggest threats are boats , cold water , toxic algae blooms and fishing debris like discarded lines and ropes			0
a record 829 manatees died last year , breaking the 2010 record of 766 , according to state records			1

majestic : a manatee swims among a school of fish as the @entity5 reviews its classification friendly : in this photo taken at the @entity65 in @entity77 , @entity2 the gentle mammal shows off its temperament a record 276 manatee deaths were caused by a toxic red tide bloom in the @entity119			1
there were also the unexplained deaths of more than 100 manatees on @entity2 's east coast , where pollution and algae blooms have plagued a vital lagoon ecosystem			1
meanwhile , critics of the manatee 's current endangered listing say manatees are important to the state 's tourism industry and environment			1

’ according to the wildlife service , officials began working on the reclassification proposal in 2013			0
it was shelved due to funding constraints during the @entity176 government shutdown and concerns over recent spikes in manatee deaths			0
save the @entity181 executive director @entity180 said that while the species has certainly rebounded , more work needs to be done			0
‘ the most compelling reason not to down - list them is the status of their ecosystems , ’ @entity184 said			2
‘ if you maintain good quality habitat , you can overcome catastrophic mortality events			0
‘ if you are dealing with both catastrophic mortality events and unrelenting compromises to their aquatic ecosystems at the same time , that 's when you need to be acting very conservatively			2
but @entity197 says the government is bowing to political pressure and emotion , highlighting conservation efforts at the expense of the law and business			0
‘ does anyone ever want to talk about how last year 1,000 manatees were born ? heck , no. all they want to talk about is how many died , ’ @entity197 said .			1
