right now all we can think about is getting @entity33 to @entity23 for the treatment she needs to survive			2
' we will live in a box if we need to as long as we are together			0
' we have worked hard , our house is all we have but we will sell it to save her			2
‘ some people might criticise us for making the family homeless when we have two other children but i would rather do that than have to tell her brothers we let @entity33 die			0
' what choice do we have ? if we wait for @entity58 funding it will probably be too late			2
’ @entity33 began complaining of pain in her legs in may this year			0
mrs @entity50 said : ‘ @entity33 said her legs were aching , so i told her to rest			1
' like most kids her age she was always on the go but when it got worse i took her to the doctor who said it was just growing pain			0
’ doctors have told the family @entity33 may not live until @entity3			0
to apply for proton beam therapy on the @entity58 takes around eight weeks - time the youngster does n't have mrs @entity50 said : ' we will live in a box if we need to , as long as we are together			1
we have worked hard , our house is all we have but we will sell it to save her			2
' @entity33 is pictured , right with a children 's entertainer dressed up as @entity119 from @entity120 , at her seventh birthday party in august but in the weeks that followed , mrs @entity50 noticed her daughter falling over and bruises appearing on her legs			1
she went back to the @entity126 and said she was told this time that @entity33 was flat footed which was causing her balance problems			0
but unconvinced mrs @entity50 took her daughter back again and says she was advised to take her for an eye test and again told it was growing pain			1
when her daughter ’s pain got worse she arranged further visits and said on the sixth occasion she was annoyed to have been booked to see a locum gp			0
‘ i felt he would n’t know my daughter and made that clear , ' she said			0
@entity140 beam therapy is an advanced form of radiotherapy that targets tumours with great precision			1
the radiation that uses beams of protons - small parts of an atom - rather than high energy x-rays , used in conventional radiotherapy			0
unlike an x-ray , the proton stops after striking the target rather than continuing to travel through the body			0
it enables therapists to direct the beam at a tumour more precisely			0
the beam can be more finely controlled , in both its width and its depth , so higher doses of radiation can be more safely delivered to tumours , with less risk to healthy tissues			0
the treatment has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of many different tumours , including those found in the head and neck , eye , central nervous system , lung , prostate and gastrointestinal tract			0
the precision of the pencil beam scanning makes it especially beneficial in treating tumours adjacent to critical and sensitive organs , such as the eye , brain and spinal cord			0
source : @entity187 ' but to my surprise he was the first to perform a basic neurological test by asking @entity33 to follow his finger with her eyes			0
' she could n’t do it and he told me to get straight to hospital for an mri scan			0
’ at @entity199 in @entity40 , an @entity200 revealed a dangerous build up of fluid on the little girl ’s brain and she was sent by ambulance to @entity206 in @entity207 for urgent surgery the following morning			0
the operation on july 18 revealed a mass on her brain stem was causing the build up			0
mrs @entity50 said : ‘ i was shocked			1
you never think it will happen to you			0
' but at the same time i had known all along it was something more serious than growing pains			2
' the following week a biopsy revealed the tumour was cancerous and on august 4 the devastated couple were told the rare nature of high grade @entity224 ’s in children made it hard to predict how she would respond to treatment			2
but the position on the brain stem made it impossible to operate on and medics hoped to stabilise it with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy when she was older and her brain more developed			2
mr and mrs @entity50 were due to marry later that month on august 23 and mrs @entity50 originally wanted to call off the wedding they had booked back in january but @entity33 was desperate to be a bridesmaid			1
‘ we ’d been so busy in hospital that i had n’t arranged the cars or wedding shoes , it was the last thing on my mind but doctors advised us to go ahead with the wedding because @entity33 was well enough and she was looking forward to it , ’ mrs @entity50 said			1
but first @entity33 turned seven on august 15 and the family hastily arranged a huge party , not knowing if it would be her last			0
two weeks later the couple married surrounded by family and friends			0
@entity33 revelling in her role as chief bridesmaid			0
mrs @entity50 said : ‘ it was all about her , there was n’t a dry eye in the house because nobody knew what the future held			1
‘ she had lost some of her hair because of the surgery but she looked so beautiful			0
’ doctors misdiagnosed @entity272 's brain tumour as growing pains five times before her parents were told she was battling cancer the family have also set up a fundraising page to raise money for @entity33 's treatment @entity33 started chemotherapy two days later but suffered terrible side effects , including nausea , weight loss and a bleed on the brain			1
and when medics scanned her last week the tumour was found to have tripled in size and spread to her spine			1
that is when @entity238 and mrs @entity50 were told proton beam therapy offered the best chance of saving her life and there was no time to waste			1
the family set up a fundraising page and well wishers have already pledged more than £ 20,000 - but the family need to raise a further £ 140,00 for treatment and travel in the next week			1
they put their house on the market for £ 170,000 this week and say making themselves homeless will be a small price to save their daughter ’s life			1
‘ it would be nice to have a home to come back to after @entity23 , but nothing is more important than saving @entity33 , ' mrs @entity50 said			1
donations have been flooding in , and a second page has been set up to help accept money from the public			2
