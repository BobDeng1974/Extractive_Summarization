he said the behaviour of competitive mothers and fathers puts pressure on the children and stops them enjoying themselves – and hinders their development as players			0
the @entity14 presenter said they should just ‘ shut the f * * * up ’ while watching their youngsters			1
@entity1 , pictured here with his first wife , @entity20 , and their children @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , has hit out at the ' utterly depressing ' culture of pushy parents @entity1 , 52 , has previously told how he has been moved to speak to other fathers on the touchline at football matches to try to get them to calm down			1
writing in the @entity29 , the former @entity31 player , who scored 48 goals in 80 international games , was bemoaning the standard of football at youth level			1
he said : ‘ it ’s obvious why we have a long - ball culture : the big lads who can kick it furthest are the ones that stand out			0
what chance for the diminutive yet gifted midfielder ? no chance of him developing his tiki - taka football			0
‘ the only way to get to the other end of the pitch is to belt it and then belt it again			0
’ and he said that some of the blame for this mentality lay with the parents who do n’t allow their children time to develop as players			2
@entity1 – who was asked to contribute to the magazine by guest editor comedian @entity60 – wrote : ‘ this madness is only exacerbated by the maniacal parents on the touchline spouting nonsense at their children			2
‘ the competitive nature of most mums and dads is astounding			0
the fear they instil in our promising but sensitive @entity70 is utterly depressing			1
we need a parental cultural revolution			0
if we could just get them to shut the f * * * up and let their children enjoy themselves , you would be staggered at the difference it would make			1
’ @entity1 scored 48 goals in 80 international games during his @entity31 career @entity1 has previously spoken of how he was left shocked at the behaviour of fellow parents he encountered on the sidelines when he was a spectator at amateur games played by his children @entity24 , 21 , @entity23 , 19 , @entity25 , 16 , and @entity87 , 13 , all from his first marriage to @entity20			1
he said the problem of pushy and aggressive parents is n’t so much of an issue in other countries such as @entity93 , where parents are much more relaxed with their children			1
in a previous piece he wrote : ‘ i remember the applause from watching parents when something good happened on the pitch – and patient silence if a pass went astray			2
’ but in @entity31 , he says he has witnessed mothers and fathers swearing at the referee , abusing the manager and shouting at their own children – one time even seeing a father take his own son off the pitch because he thought he was playing poorly			1
@entity1 , who was never booked or sent off in his career , admitted he has even confronted other parents in a bid to get them to calm down			0
@entity1 made the comments in the @entity29 magazine , which was guest - edited by @entity60 he wrote previously : ‘ it ’s got so bad at times that i ’ve felt it necessary to have a quiet word with some of them to tone it down , politely suggesting that their “ commitment ” is n’t actually helping their own sons relax and enjoy playing the game			2
’ he added : ‘ there is a breed of parent i ’ve seen who hurl ridiculous abuse at the officials or even the young player they are meant to be supporting			0
‘ it is as if they are living their own dreams through their kids			0
they put far too much pressure on them and the results can be shocking			0
