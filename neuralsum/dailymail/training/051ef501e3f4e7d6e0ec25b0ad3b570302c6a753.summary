three top judges at the @entity16 said @entity6 should never have been jailed speaking outside court , mr @entity6 ’s sister , @entity19 , said : ' this was a clear miscarriage of justice and i am relieved that we can start grieving for @entity13			1
' i am angry at the @entity26 and the police who charged my brother			1
' the system has gone badly wrong here and i am relieved he has been released today			2
there are no words that can account for what my family and i have gone through			2
' lord @entity37 told the court 30 - year - old @entity13 was confronted by a gang of up to 15 white youths in june 2010 , shortly after a racist attack on @entity43 takeway in @entity44			1
his brother @entity6 and friend @entity45 , 30 , were passing in a car and got out in a bid to help him			1
as they went to @entity13 ’s aid he was punched to the ground , causing injuries from which the father - of - three tragically died 12 days later , the judge said			2
a charge of manslaughter against one of the gang was later dropped due to lack of evidence , and @entity6 and @entity45 were controversially accused of violent disorder , which they later admitted , the court heard			1
at @entity64 in november last year , both men received longer sentences than those who initiated the violence , with @entity6 handed a three - and - a - half year jail term and @entity45 jailed for three years			1
four others were given sentences of up to two years and nine months after they admitted violent disorder			2
two of them also pleaded guilty to affray			2
appealing today , @entity73 , for @entity74 , said : ' there is a sense from the family and the appellant that he should never have pleaded guilty to this			0
it is truly a tragic case			0
' @entity13 was confronted by a gang of up to 15 white youths in june 2010 , shortly after a racist attack on @entity43 takeaway in @entity44 @entity45 ’s lawyer , @entity86 , added : ' the judge had no regard at all to the fact that the brother of one of appellants died , and the very good friend of the other			1
' it is of great concern to them that they were unable to do more to help the man who they got out of the car to protect			1
it was not necessary to send those men to custody			0
' he told the court @entity45 ’s nine - year - old niece sadly died from cancer while he was inside , and it was a source of ' great distress ' to him that he was not around to comfort his family			0
lord @entity37 , sitting with mr @entity112 and mrs @entity113 , ruled that suspended sentences were the most the two men should have faced and cut both prison terms to allow their release			0
the judge said : ' it is not easily clear to determine why the two appellants pleaded guilty			0
they appear to have accepted that , having started effecting some lawful violence in defence of @entity13 , they went beyond that which they ought to have done			0
' whilst accepting that this court is loathe to interfere with a trial judge ’s assessment of culpability , we take the view that the judge seriously over-estimated and over-categorised the culpability of these two appellants			0
' we take the view that , if there was to be custodial sentences at all , it would have been a short one that would have been suspended			0
however , they have now been in custody since november and have served a significant time in prison			0
' doing the best that we can do by passing a sentence which ensures their immediate release , but accepting that the sentence we would have passed would have been shorter , we substitute a sentence of nine months			2
' outside court , miss @entity150 added : ' it is clear from the judge ’s remarks today that he should not have been charged			0
he was grief - ridden and frightened when he pleaded guilty			0
