' political protest ' : the owner of the @entity7 eatery in @entity9 , north - west @entity10 , has sparked outrage by placing the picture of the @entity15 dictator on display one @entity9 resident said : ‘ we live in a society where a cabbie can be told not to fly the @entity37 flag in his car or people ca n't display them in offices			1
and yet this guy gets away with posting a picture of @entity4 in his window			2
’ another added : ‘ i will never go there again as they now have a huge poster of a smiling @entity4 in their window			2
are they completely mad or just total morons ? i think this place should be boycotted			2
how dare they ? ’ @entity56 leader @entity55 went to the restaurant with an enforcement officer and asked the owner to take the picture down			1
she said the owner was ‘ polite but defiant ’ and said it was not a council issue and it was his freedom to display the picture			1
@entity65 said : ‘ we have had several members of the public complain and ask what the council can do about it			2
the short answer is we are limited in what we can do			0
‘ the police have also , we understand , been to the restaurant but the owner gave them the same response			1
the council is currently considering whether there are any options it could look at			2
‘ for example whether this picture constitutes a potential breach of the peace - but again that is more a police matter			0
’ she added : ‘ i am all for free speech but the relatives of @entity90 service people killed or injured fighting in @entity15 might not see it that way			0
‘ @entity9 has a multi-ethnic population and to allow this picture to remain in the restaurant window could give offence to many , and could prove a licence for agitators to provoke trouble			1
