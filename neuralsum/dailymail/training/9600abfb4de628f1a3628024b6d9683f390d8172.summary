@entity0 will stop for a moment on wednesday night			0
as @entity2 clambers off the @entity4 coach on @entity5 , hundreds will gather to catch a glimpse			1
half of the world ’s big two is in town for one week only			0
it ’s not to be missed			0
@entity2 has already captured the imagination around @entity15 ’s @entity14 base – particularly after playing a practice match against the club ’s under 21 side – and is set to dazzle under the @entity20 lights			1
@entity2 practices his shooting as @entity4 train at @entity15 's @entity23 the @entity25 superstar listens to @entity4 coach @entity26 during the training session @entity2 and his @entity4 teammates were wrapped up warm on a blustery night in east @entity0 @entity2 will lead the @entity30 finalists out against @entity31 in an international friendly at @entity33 on wednesday @entity2 - pictured playing against @entity34 on saturday - will draw a decent crowd when @entity4 play at the home of @entity15 @entity37 ( right , pictured while at @entity38 in 2012 ) is set to play some part for @entity31 during the friendly @entity37 ( left , playing for @entity41 ) was snapped up by @entity25 but has only featured for the b team thus far there are question marks over whether @entity46 striker @entity45 will feature for @entity48 's side @entity49 ( playing against @entity50 on saturday ) is likely to start on the bench for the @entity52 in east @entity0 @entity53 scoring for @entity54 against @entity56 goalkeeper @entity55 during the weekend 's 2 - 2 draw that fleeting game was described as an ‘ unreal experience ’ by youngster @entity60 as fever engulfs this pocket of the capital			1
@entity2 has sprinkled a little bit of magic already			2
but that will hit new highs when @entity4 take on @entity31 at @entity33			1
only @entity68 – with the added gravitas and swagger – is bigger business than @entity2			2
for many , the little forward is their hero and any opportunity to see him in the flesh - in their own backyard - has to be taken			0
although @entity15 are only hosting a friendly , one which should be relatively one - sided , you only had to be down at @entity23 on tuesday to fully realise what this means			2
@entity82 might be banging in goals this season and on his way to becoming a new icon , but it is not often a three - time @entity89 rocks up ready to play ball			2
the @entity25 star will play wide for @entity26 ’s team against depleted opposition			0
add to that suggestions of @entity95 and @entity53 also playing , and there could be goals aplenty			1
there is also the added subplot in @entity95 ’s return to a place he is adorned for the first time since november 2012 on a night when he will end a three - year absence from international football			1
only he wo n’t be a rival on this occasion , but a striker to celebrate and applaud			0
@entity109 too , although his stock is n’t quite so high with @entity15			2
@entity54 striker @entity53 is one of several @entity112 stars selected in the @entity4 squad @entity4 's players warmed up for their friendly encounter with a behind closed doors game against @entity118 21 side the 27 - year - old appeared to be feeling the effects of the @entity123 weather away from the warmer climate in @entity125 former @entity15 striker @entity95 has been called up to the @entity4 squad for the first time in over three years @entity2 passes the ball to @entity128 - the @entity25 forward has been lined up for a place on the right side of @entity4 's attack @entity95 has been in superb form for @entity134 , including scoring a solo wonder goal against @entity136 at the weekend @entity95 will return to @entity33 on wednesday after rescuing @entity15 from relegation in 2006 - 07 @entity4 have an embarrassment of riches up front with @entity95 ( left ) and @entity2 ( right ) likely to be accompanied by @entity53 while @entity48 ’s @entity31 are without a number of star names , likely to rest @entity49 and @entity143 while striker @entity45 may be on the bench			1
@entity49 would actually rather be out there amongst it			2
‘ of course i ’d love to play against @entity4 , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’d be wonderful , but the match against @entity149 is much more important and we ’re going to prepare well for sunday			0
‘ i think the game against @entity4 will be a good one			1
i think they ’re scary and play really well , but we ’re going to work hard to get a good result			0
i hope we can put up a good fight			0
’ but it does hand an opportunity to an 18 - year - old who – if he continues a startling rise – seems primed to carry the hopes of a nation for the next decade and more			1
@entity4 coach @entity26 has vowed to entertain the crowd by playing a strong side against @entity31 on wednesday @entity165 to experiment in @entity31 friendly @entity168 's record signing @entity166 arrives at the training ground in @entity170 , @entity0 @entity128 has impressed at @entity171 following his @entity123 record £ 60m transfer from @entity174 @entity37 is the name and will definitely feature against @entity4			1
the midfielder has only turned out for @entity177 in his short career so far but is drawing huge praise			2
@entity25 thought enough of him to hand the teenager a five - year contract after an encouraging spell in the first team at @entity38			1
there has been @entity112 interest , but you fancy the @entity188 want to keep him close			0
‘ obviously he has great potential and there is a great career ahead of him , ’ @entity48 said			0
‘ he has the quality and has spoken with his @entity25 team - mates regarding wednesday 's match			0
i 'm sure they are all looking forward to it			0
’ watching @entity2 strut his stuff and having a look at a star in the making - @entity166 has n't even got a mention			1
and they said international friendlies had lost all meaning .			0

@entity4 warmed up for their international friendly against @entity31 with a practice game against @entity211
behind closed doors game featured the likes of @entity2 , @entity53 , @entity109 and @entity166
@entity95 is primed for a return to @entity33 - two years after his last game there
@entity31 are likely to rest @entity49 and @entity143 but @entity37 will play some part
the 18 - year - old plays for @entity177 but has a *bright* future ahead of him
