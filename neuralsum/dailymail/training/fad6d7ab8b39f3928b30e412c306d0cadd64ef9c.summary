a conservative school board made the controversial decision to remove information about contraception from a biology book because it flouts state law			1
members of the @entity8 board , in @entity9 voted 3 - 2 on tuesday night to take out two pages from ‘ @entity12 ’ which dealt with contraception			1
the school board argued that the information in the book went against a law which states that students should be given ' facts about childbirth or adoption over abortion			1
' controversial : members of the @entity8 board , voted 3 - 2 on tuesday night to take out two pages from ‘ @entity12 ’ book , pictured here , the board covers at least 38 schools and 39,000 students mostly in @entity28 and @entity29 , in @entity9			1
board member @entity30 told @entity31 in @entity32 : ‘ by redacting , we are not censoring			2
’ ‘ this school district does offer sexual education classes			2
if we were censoring , we would not offer anything on this topic whatsoever			0
’ the biology textbook describes , among other topics , contraception techniques , including explanations of how the morning - after pill works			1
and it was this mention of the morning - after pill being able to induce an abortion that led @entity47 - based legal group , @entity46 , to write to the @entity8 superintendent in august			1
it said that a parent had raised concerns that the text was not compliant with state legislation			0
the textbook was also criticized for going against the beliefs of some conservative @entity56 who believe that life begins at the moment of conception			0
however , the book also points out that abstinence is the only fail - safe birth control method			0
school board : @entity64 , left , and @entity65 were among members from the @entity8 governing board who weighed in on this week 's decision to edit a biology textbook @entity70 , left , and @entity71 , right , were among members who voted 3 - 2 that the high school textbook does not align with state law on how abortion is to be presented to public - school students @entity77 , another board member voted to remove the pages that did not comply with the law in 2012 , @entity80 governor @entity80 signed the law which states ‘ the state has a strong interest in promoting childbirth and adoption over elective abortion , ’ in school programs			1
but the alliance said the materials , which have been used in the district since 2006 , present elective abortions as a viable option for students while making no mention of childbirth or adoption			0
however , an official from the state ’s @entity98 said in an email to @entity8 last month that the book did not appear on its face to violate the law			2
yet they agreed that it was important for locally elected school boards to choose texts they prefer when it comes to a topic such as sex education , ‘ where the values of parents are heavily involved			0
’ there have been a series of debates recently over the best way to teach @entity119 teens about sexual health and reproduction in public schools			0
last month in @entity123 a fight over the content of an advanced history course took center stage as the school curriculum came under scrutiny .			0

members of the @entity8 board , voted 3 - 2 to take out two pages from ‘ @entity12 ’
the board covers at least 38 schools and 39,000 students in @entity9
there were complaints the book described the use of the morning - after pill
this *challenged* a law that states students should have facts about childbirth over abortion
