voters in every ethnic group want the number of migrants coming to @entity4 to be cut , reveals a report out today			1
overall , the survey found that 79 per cent of respondents thought immigration levels should be reduced with 59 per cent wanting a big drop			1
this support for stricter border controls was shared by people from all ethnic groups , according to analysis by campaign group @entity15			2
home secretary @entity16 has been pushing for a firm immigration pledge to be included in the next @entity19 manifesto , after the failed a pledge to cut the number coming here to ' tens of thousands ' some 60 per cent of @entity24 respondents wish to see immigration reduced , with 38 per cent wanting it down by a lot			1
the same is true of black respondents with 57 per cent thinking it should be curbed and 32 per cent wanting a large cut			1
for those of mixed origin , 60 per cent wanted a decrease with 30 per cent wanting a big fall			1
of those classed as ‘ other ’ ethnicities , 56 per cent wanted a drop with 32 per cent believing there should be a large reduction			1
for all minority groups combined , most want lower immigration levels while about 30 per cent want them to stay the same			1
only one in ten want it to rise , making it unlikely that policies to curb immigration would deter ethnic minorities from voting for the conservatives			1
the report is a response to the centre - right lobby group @entity51 , which claims the @entity52 must abandon their target to limit net migration to attract more black and ethnic minority voters			1
home secretary @entity16 , who wants a firm pledge to cut migration in the @entity19 manifesto , recently quit as a member of @entity51 ’s advisory board			1
a poll by @entity15 found that 60 per cent of @entity65 , 57 per cent of black people , and 60 per cent of those from mixed backgrounds wanted to see a cut ( pictured , pedestrians on a street in @entity69 ) @entity15 said that while tighter immigration controls do not deter voters from an ethnic minority background , the tone of the debate must be ‘ right ’			1
it said black and ethnic minority voters are more likely to see previous waves of immigration as positive for the @entity4 but are clearly concerned about current levels			1
vice-chairman @entity79 said : ‘ the report confirms that the concerns of ethnic minority voters are very similar to everyone else and why would n’t they be ? ‘ the way to appeal to ethnic minority communities is to propose reasonable policies and reducing net migration to the level last seen in the early 1990s is entirely reasonable			2
’ @entity89 , a member of @entity15 who has founded a series of inter-faith groups , said : ‘ the majority of people share similar concerns			0
‘ they are worried about schools , hospitals , jobs and overcrowding			0
‘ it is ludicrous to lump diverse communities together in suggesting we all want mass immigration			2
reasonable levels are the only way to achieve strengthened community relations			0
’ the @entity52 are expected to repeat @entity108 ’s promise to cut net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’			1
it is now almost 300,000			0
the report is based on the @entity113 , a long - running poll of 3,000 residents			0
@entity117 aide : we did n't expect all those @entity120 plumbers sir @entity121 , @entity122 adviser from 2000 to 2004 , said @entity123 did n't see the attraction @entity4 would present to skilled @entity120 workers , such as plumbers @entity123 failed to realise the @entity4 would prove a magnet for @entity120 plumbers , @entity117 ’s most senior @entity122 adviser admitted yesterday			0
the admission came in a series of revelations about how @entity123 chronically mishandled eastern @entity134 immigration			2
in advance of @entity120 and seven other @entity138 nations joining the @entity122 in 2004 , ministers relied upon advice suggesting only 13,000 would settle each year			0
but more than one million have travelled to the @entity4 , attracted by wages which are significantly higher than at home – with at least half settling here in what proved one of the biggest waves of immigration in @entity4 history			2
sir @entity121 , an @entity122 adviser between 2000 and 2004 , said : ‘ we simply did n’t take account properly of the pull factor of @entity150 for people with skills who could probably find a bigger market [ in the @entity4 ] for their skills – you know , the @entity120 plumber			0
’ the remarks risk re-igniting the debate about @entity123 ’s record on immigration – for which @entity160 recently apologised			2
last night @entity161 of @entity162 , chairman of @entity15 , told the @entity164 : ‘ it is astonishing that nobody properly considered the impact of the wage differential between @entity4 and ... @entity120			0
' we said at the time the forecast of 13,000 a year was almost worthless			0
in fact , it was completely worthless			0
’ yesterday it also emerged that former labour cabinet minister @entity173 had written to chancellor @entity174 and home secretary @entity175 in 2006 to warn the new arrivals were having a huge impact but was largely ignored			0
mr @entity173 said that wages were being driven down by as much as 50 per cent and that @entity180 departments were under strain , adding : ‘ on @entity122 migration there was a catastrophic failure of the civil service machine			1
’ not backing down : despite mr @entity121 's comments , former home secretary @entity187 ( pictured during his time in office ) defended @entity123 's record , he is ' confident ' mass migration was a good idea in a further bombshell , respected economist @entity196 , writing in the left - wing @entity194 newspaper , exploded @entity123 ’s economic case for mass migration			2
he argued that it had a ‘ barely perceptible ’ impact on economic growth per head while suppressing the wages of the less well - off			0
‘ it is the relatively unskilled in the bottom half of the distribution who have lost out , ’ he said			0
but former home secretary @entity209 was unrepentant about the party ’s record , saying : ‘ i ’m confident that it was the right decision , even though very few people now will stand up for it			0

survey found 79 per cent want decrease while 59 per cent want big drop
