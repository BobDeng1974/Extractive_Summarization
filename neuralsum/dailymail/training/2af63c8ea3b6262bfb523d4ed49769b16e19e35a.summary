by @entity0 published : 08:23 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 09:28 est , 11 june 2013 @entity2 striker @entity1 has underlined his need to leave @entity4 despite his love for the club and accused the media and the @entity8 of driving him out			1
the @entity10 star is in @entity11 preparing for the @entity12 and @entity2 have insisted he is not for sale			1
but @entity1 , who is serving a 10 - game domestic ban for biting @entity17 defender @entity16 , has again railed against his treatment from the media			1
ready to say goodbye : @entity1 says he is being driven out of @entity2 ' ever since i arrived i have felt bad , they have never judged me for my play but with the attitude that he dives , protests , makes gestures , racism ... everything , ' @entity1 told television show @entity28			1
' they have never spoken well of me			1
for that reason , when i was told i could win the @entity34 award , i said , " i will not get excited as i know that i will never win an important award in @entity31 "			1
' @entity1 also feels the @entity8 are against him , comparing his ban for racially abusing @entity36 with that of @entity38 , who was suspended for half the amount of games after a similar incident with @entity42			1
@entity1 suggested the fact he is @entity11 counted against him			2
never given a chance : @entity1 says he has been portrayed in a negative way by the media ' without any proof they gave me an eight - match ban , but with @entity38 , where they had proof , lip - readers , they gave him four			1
i 'm @entity11 and i think that 's the root of all of this , ' he added			2
' @entity2 is a club that i dreamt about playing for as a boy			2
i have been with great players there , they know me and i would love to continue for many more years at @entity2			2
the stadium is spectacular , the fans are phenomenal : people with tattoos of me , things that i could never have imagined			2
' after the [ @entity36 ] suspension people would come up to me , this is something that really touched me and they would say , " @entity1 forget everything and stay			2
" ' but i ca n't forget as it was something that i had to suffer , that my family had to suffer and away from football i have a family to support and who are hurt by these things			2
' biting point : @entity1 sinks his teeth into @entity16 's arm unfair : @entity1 says his ban for racism against @entity36 was too harsh asked again where he sees himself going , should he leave he said : ' my agent said to remain calm rather than quiet , remain calm and when there is concrete interest you 'll be the first to know			0
' @entity1 also recounted a recent incident during a shopping trip , which affected him and his family			0
' about a week ago i was walking in a shopping centre near @entity86 and three or four guys asked me for a photo , ' he revealed			0
' while we were posing for it my wife said to me , " @entity1 , get out of the photo "			0
she noticed they were making biting gestures			0
i was with my wife and my daughter			0
things like that get on your nerves			0
my wife was on the brink of tears and the blokes ran off laughing			0
you get tired of stuff like that			0
' is this the end ? @entity1 says he loves @entity2 but has to leave @entity1 has already said he would be open to a move to @entity109 and added : ' i 'm not sure if i see myself in the white ( of @entity109 ) , the only thing i know is that i have a contract , ' he said			1
' any player would like to play for a great team and @entity109 certainly are that			1
' every player wants to reach the very top and @entity109 are at the very top , but everything that has been said is just rumours , i have had nothing concrete			1
' obviously @entity109 is a great team and every player dreams about them ; @entity109 is @entity109 and it 's as high as you can go as a player and they will always tempt you			1
' the good and the bad : @entity1 scored plenty of goals and was a favourite among @entity2 fans - but he drew criticism for his diving ( below ) @entity1 says he and compatriot @entity129 do n't speak about their respective futures , with the @entity133 striker also the subject of transfer interest			1
' we have never really spoken about whether this club or that is interested			0
obviously we talk about football ; he asks me about the @entity141 and i ask him about @entity142 , ' he said			0
' but we have never talked or even even joked about one of us going to one club or another			0
' i would prefer to have him as a team - mate than a rival because he is a great player			0
hopefully he will go to one of the four you dream of because he has great power			0
