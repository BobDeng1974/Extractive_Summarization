by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:53 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 20:43 est , 20 august 2013 @entity3 's expos√© that the missing coal ministry files pertain to companies linked to @entity7 politicians created a storm in @entity9 that stalled @entity12 's pet @entity10 on tuesday			1
the coal block allocations to 13 companies now named in firs in the @entity17 's investigation were made between 2006 and 2009			1
prime minister @entity18 held the coal portfolio when several of these allocations were made			1
the @entity22 uproar in @entity9 forced the @entity23 to abandon attempts to introduce the @entity10 despite the government 's elaborate preparations to bring the bill			2
parliamentary affairs minister @entity28 had personally called on mps to be present and a deal had been cut with the @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 ( @entity34 ) that the government would be flexible over their amendments to the proposed bill			0
@entity12 also had an emotional reason to get the bill introduced in @entity9 on august 20 : it is the birthday of her late husband , former prime minister @entity40			1
but the @entity42 storm spoiled the party			0
sources say she is unhappy that @entity7 party managers and the government failed to forecast the storm over the missing @entity42 files and wants to know why preemptive action was n't taken to minimise damage			1
@entity3 had revealed in its tuesday edition that many missing files crucial to the @entity17 's investigation of @entity42 belonged to companies related to a @entity7 mp			1
@entity17 director @entity57 had also told @entity3 that it was a big setback to the agency 's investigation			1
" the government will have to come with cogent answers			0
they have said some files have gone missing before 2004			2
there was nothing before 2004 , the real problem is only of allocation post- 2004 , " @entity66 leader @entity65 told @entity3			2
" why should we distract from the food bill ? this is a serious matter			0
destruction of evidence is a crime , has an fir been registered ? " @entity65 asked			0
' a huge crime ' asked about the missing files , he said : " it is a huge crime			1
the case is under investigation , how can files disappear like this ? " there are three powerful targets of investigation - the beneficiaries who benefited from coal blocks , the screening committee which allotted the mines and the minister , the minister 's office and the @entity97			1
" and suddenly the files are found missing , " @entity65 added			2
asked about the party 's strategy , he said : " the party will have to take a collective decision			0
" opposition members are worried that if the files are not found , the case being built by the @entity17 might collapse for want of evidence , and powerful people will be let off the hook			1
of the 13 companies against whom the @entity17 filed firs , files related to 11 are missing			1
these include @entity115 , @entity116 , which was allocated @entity118 block in @entity119 on may 29 , 2009			0
the directors of this company - @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , and @entity125 - have close ties to @entity7 mp @entity127			2
another @entity130 company 's files are also missing			2
the company is @entity132 , @entity116			0
it was allocated @entity134 in @entity135 on january 23 , 2008			0
the directors are @entity127 , @entity130 , @entity125 , @entity123 , @entity137 and @entity138			0
another company , m / s @entity141 , @entity142 , was allocated @entity143 ( @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 ) in @entity147 on november 20 , 2008			0
the company was sold later to @entity149 , a close aide of former @entity147 chief minister @entity150 ( @entity66 )			0
the directors are @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159			0
in @entity9 , the @entity22 slammed the @entity23 government , sought a response from the prime minister and forced the adjournment of both houses			1
the combined @entity22 said it was " shameful " on the part of the government and it should explain what exactly happened and who was responsible			0
cries of " @entity169 ! shame ! " and " @entity171 jawab do ( prime minister , answer ) " were heard in @entity9			1
in the @entity176 the charge was led by leader of the opposition @entity177 who said the pm should come to the @entity179 and assure members that the @entity17 probe would not be hampered due to the missing files			1
claiming that the files included applications for coal blocks , she alleged that they have gone missing as some big shots in the @entity7 were involved			1
@entity189 wanted the speaker to direct the pm to come to the @entity179 and make a statement			0
the opposition forced three adjournments over the issue before lunch , asking coal minister @entity196 to recuse himself from replying and demanding that pm @entity18 make a statement			1
they said propriety demands that @entity196 abstain as the missing files reportedly relate to a beneficiary of coal block allocation who is linked to the minister			1
" all efforts are being made to locate documents which are not readily available , " @entity196 said , adding that a total " 769 files and documents running into 1.5 lakh pages have been handed over to the investigating agency "			0
raising the issue in the @entity212 , leader of the opposition @entity65 referred to the @entity3 report , saying : " there are media reports that one of the beneficiaries of the coal block allocation was somebody to whom the coal minister was related			1
" if files relating to that allocation are missing , should he be making a statement on those files ? " in a letter addressed to the pm , the @entity227 's @entity226 said it gives rise to serious concern that the files have been deliberately removed " so that people in high positions do not get involved and the role of the @entity97 does not come under the shadow of suspicion "			1
he urged the @entity173 to initiate an " effective , proper and neutral " probe to discover the people " sabotaging the investigation " of the @entity17			2
@entity22 @entity42 united the @entity22 with the @entity239 also supporting the demand			0
the @entity227 's @entity241 said : " @entity179 must know how these files are missing			2
it is appropriate that the minister then in charge should make the statement on how the files went missing			2
" the committee is mandated to examine and review non-availability of files / documents and suggest appropriate action , he said , adding that it has held two meetings and documents are being located			0
amid slogan - shouting by the @entity66 , @entity196 said some documents belonging to a period prior to 2004 are missing and asked who had an interest in getting the files of the pre- 2004 period to go missing ; he was pointing the needle of suspicion at the @entity263 regime			0
however , the @entity66 members saw this as a ploy to shift the blame .			0
