by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:07 est , 6 february 2014 @entity3 : 04:19 est , 6 february 2014 work and pensions secretary @entity4 has faced mounting criticism about the introduction of @entity7 the government ’s flagship benefits overhaul is costing £ 225,000 per person to introduce , new figures show			1
the much - delayed @entity7 combining six benefits into one has so far cost £ 612million			1
@entity13 once claimed 1million people be receiving the payments by april this year , but with just six months to go there were only 2,720 signed up			1
the @entity7 project has suffered a series of setbacks , with ministers forced to admit the target of having all new and existing claimants on @entity7 by 2017 will be missed			1
@entity23 claimed that if the project had stayed o track the cost per person signed up by now would be only £ 612			1
but employment minister @entity26 revealed in response to a parliamentary question that the scheme has so far cost £ 615million from 2010 to 2014			0
this included £ 100million in 2011 - 12 , £ 320million in 2012 - 13 and £ 192million in 2013 - 14			2
however the timescale for adding people to the hugely complex system has repeteadly slipped			0
@entity34 , @entity23 ’s shadow welfare minister , said : ‘ @entity13 's flagship policy has been plagued with delay after delay from the outset and millions of pounds have been wasted			2
‘ we were once told universal credit would be on time and on budget and that a million people would be on the system by april this year , but this has come to nothing			2
‘ it is staggering that the government has spent £ 225,000 per person on this project			0
’ @entity7 will combine @entity51 , income - related @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and housing benefit			1
@entity58 's spending watchdog has said the @entity59 failed to achieve ‘ value for money ’ in its development and needed to adopt ‘ realistic expectations ’ on the timetable for its delivery			0
shake - up : @entity7 will combine @entity51 , income - related @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and housing benefit the @entity67 warning came after mr @entity13 admitted that more than £ 40 million spent on it for the project had been written off in 2012 - 13			1
a further £ 91million of bespoke software will become defunct when the system is operational in 2017 , although the department insisted this was ‘ not a write - off ’			2
cabinet office minister @entity74 was forced to deny reports of a rift with mr @entity13 over the project , but said its initial implementation had been ‘ pretty lamentable ’			0
amid mounting criticism , in december mr @entity13 angrily denied the scheme was in chaos , telling the @entity82 work and pensions committee : ‘ there is no debacle on @entity7			1
’ but trouble - shooter @entity86 , who was brought in this year to rescue the £ 2.4billion scheme , said it still faced major challenges in dealing with all but the most straightforward benefit claims			0
he said the automated system could not currently deal with claims involving couples or children			0
a tiny pilot scheme involving just 2,000 people had focused almost exclusively on young single men , whose claims are straightforward .			0
