by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:10 est , 25 february 2014 @entity4 : 18:36 est , 25 february 2014 concerns : @entity7 mp @entity6 has been investigating paedophile networks since the @entity10 controversy erupted in 2012 a @entity7 mp has demanded renewed and wider inquiries into the @entity12 amid fears that government files proving it received taxpayers ’ cash have been shredded			1
an ex-civil servant has previously claimed the government gave money to the @entity12 – which called paedophiles ‘ ordinary , decent , sensible human beings ’ – during the 1970s			1
home secretary @entity23 has asked @entity24 , the permanent secretary at the @entity25 , to investigate after details of the claims were passed on by @entity7 mp @entity6			2
last night mr @entity6 welcomed the probe but also demanded a wider - ranging police inquiry into the @entity12			1
he claimed @entity32 ’s paedophile squad , which is running an investigation called @entity34 into claims that an establishment paedophile ring preyed on children in care in the 1980s , is ‘ chronically under - resourced ’			0
but last night there were mounting fears that all government papers on its links to the @entity12 have been shredded			2
sources said everything that the @entity25 held on @entity12 post- 1979 appears to have been destroyed , except for the titles			1
it is understood that a total of 11 @entity12 files dating from 1979 to the mid- 1980s have been identified			1
the @entity25 insists ‘ their destruction was consistent with applicable record retention policies ’			0
mr @entity6 said : ‘ i was contacted by a former @entity25 civil servant who told me that he saw a document that suggests the @entity12 got public money			1
‘ the document was recommending approval for funding during the @entity61 government			0
my source , who does not wish to talk to the media , said it appeared to be a re-application for funds			0
he could not be certain whether or not it had been funded by a @entity7 government but he thought this was possible			0
’ mr @entity6 has been investigating paedophile networks since the @entity10 controversy erupted in 2012 and he has worked closely with the police to pass on information from private sources			1
but he said officers have got their work cut out			0
‘ @entity34 is chronically under - resourced , ’ he said			0
‘ they have arrested members of pie but what they ’re not doing is looking systematically at everyone who was in @entity12			2
‘ they are pursuing specific allegations by victims but do n’t have the resources to conduct a general inquiry			0
given the extreme public concern about @entity12 , there should be a properly resourced investigation into what the @entity12 got up to			2
’ probe : @entity24 , left , permanent secretary at the @entity25 , has been asked by home secretary @entity23 , right , to investigate after mr @entity6 passed claims that a paedophile group received public money mr @entity6 ’s comments will be a matter of great concern for @entity95 chief sir @entity94 and his senior commanders , who are under pressure to take allegations of historic child sex abuse more seriously in the aftermath of @entity101			1
it is unclear when the @entity25 inquiry into @entity12 will be completed , or whether retired civil servants with knowledge of the issue are being interviewed			1
but a well - placed source said there is a growing belief that the paedophile group did indeed receive public money			1
the source added : ‘ there is a lot of concern in the highest levels of @entity117 about what may unravel			0
’ the @entity12 was established in 1974 to campaign for the age of consent to be lowered to four			0
a year later the @entity120 – today known as the human rights watchdog @entity120 – controversially granted official ‘ affiliate ’ status to the group			0
one leaflet sent by the @entity12 to mps claimed : ‘ paedophiles are ordinary , decent , sensible human beings , no more sexually depraved than yourself , and with a capacity for loving and helping children which is at present being repressed			1
’ however , within a few years the harm caused by paedophiles became public and many of @entity12 ’s activists were jailed			2
it was disbanded in 1984			0
last night , mr @entity6 said the @entity137 have questions to answer about alleged cover - ups of paedophilia in their ranks			1
he claimed the @entity142 tried to suppress the case of diplomat sir @entity144 , who was jailed in 1984 for posting child pornography			0
mr @entity6 added : ‘ the shared shame of all the political parties is that they can do more – much more – to protect kids who face abuse			2

@entity6 also demands wider police inquiry into paedophile group
but sources say everything held on @entity12 post- 1979 has been destroyed
@entity6 warns @entity142 too face questions about paedophiles in their ranks
