by @entity0 @entity1 : 09:16 est , 19 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:33 est , 19 december 2013 @entity3 has said that she will make a decision about her presidential run next year , explaining that she had n’t made up her mind yet			1
‘ it 's such a difficult decision and it 's one that i am not going to rush into , ’ she said during an interview with @entity9 's @entity8 , who selected the former secretary of state as her most fascinating person of the year			1
‘ i have n't made up my mind - really have not			1
i 'll look carefully at what i think i can do and make that decision sometime next year			2
one such supporter is her husband , former president @entity22 , who she said may have to have a new title if she ever does end up in the @entity33 again			0
‘ i have no idea - @entity37 ? i do n't know , ’ she said of what her husband would be called if she becomes president			2
‘ he is very respectful ... he wants me to do what i think is right			0
’ rounding back : this was not the first year that @entity8 picked mrs @entity3 as her ' most fascinating ' person of the year as she was also selected back in 1993 when she was the @entity42 while she clearly tried to avoid making any commitments , the one thing she seemed certain of was the fact that there should be a female president , even though she does n’t ‘ know the exact timing of it or who that might be ’			1
‘ it matters because we have half the population that has given so much to building this country , to making it work and , of course , i want to see women in the @entity33 , ’ she said			1
‘ if i look at my friends and former colleagues , who are now in the @entity61 , it was the women senators , on both sides of the aisle , who finally broke the fever over the government shutdown and the debt limit debate			2
they have been working across party lines , and we need more of that			0
’ @entity22 may be clearly avoiding and commitment to the 2016 race , but the voters are n’t as a @entity74 poll that came out on tuesday revealed that the majority of voters in the pivotal primary state of @entity78 think she would make a good chief executive			1
remaining positive : @entity22 said that she does n't know who it should be or when it should happen but a woman should become president of the @entity84 @entity8 asked what time over the past few decades when she has interviewed @entity22 did she think was the roughest period for her - with a not - so subtle allusion to her husband ’s affair and ensuing impeachment - but @entity22 avoided any mention of those scandalous months			1
‘ the worst times really for me are the personal times - you know , losing my father , losing my mother			0
those are the hard times for me , ’ she said			0
‘ when you 're in the political public arena , you know you 're going to get credit you probably do n't deserve and blame you probably do n't deserve and you have to chart your own course			0
you have to stand up for what you think are the right decisions			0
