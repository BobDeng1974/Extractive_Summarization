by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 's claims about the effects of immigration have been called into question @entity3 ’s claims about the effects of immigration have been called into question by secret government research , it was reported last night			2
@entity10 is said to have prevented the publication of an internal report , completed in november , which suggests that the impact of migration on @entity16 jobs is ' virtually nil '			1
the @entity19 ’s @entity18 programme claimed it had not been published because the effect of immigration on unemployment was much smaller than mrs may has previously claimed			1
the home secretary has in the past cited research by the @entity27 , a group of independent academics , as a basis for saying that ‘ for every additional 100 immigrants ... 23 @entity16 workers would not be employed ’			1
but the new analysis by civil servants is understood to show that the impact of so - called ‘ displacement ’ is much less stark			1
@entity37 emails seen by @entity18 showed that one civil servant described the @entity27 research used by mrs may was ‘ not robust enough given the wider evidence ’			0
one civil servant said in an email that the study should be published - something mr @entity10 has so far refused to do			1
‘ it would be difficult to keep the report solely for internal use , ’ he wrote			1
critics say mr @entity10 has blocked the report ’s publication because it shows the home secretary ’s claims to be hollow			1
but others say it is unsurprising that the displacement rate is now lower than it was in 2012 , because last year 87 per cent of new jobs went to @entity16 people			1
the conservatives were embarrassed last week when figures showed that its pledge to reduce net migration to below 100,000 people a year by 2015 was unlikely to be met			0
last night @entity62 mp @entity61 said : ‘ it ’s obvious that this report should be published as quickly as possible			1
critics say mr @entity10 has blocked the report 's publication because the home secretary 's claims are hollow ‘ the best available data shows we benefit very substantially from immigration			1
the real question is why @entity10 is trying to block this			1
‘ we have to have the right figures to make the right decisions			0
’ @entity75 mp @entity74 said : ‘ the data is evolving			0
it ’s basically not true that the impact is minimal			0
there has been a very heavy localised impact			0
’ a government spokesman said : ‘ reducing immigration so our economy delivers for people who want to work hard and play by the rules is part of our long - term economic plan			0
we do n’t comment on internal government documents			2
’ @entity89 , the @entity62 and @entity90 were united in calling for the report to be published			2
last night @entity89 ’s immigration spokesman @entity92 said : ‘ @entity10 and @entity93 may now need to publish this report today			1
‘ the @entity16 people should have information made available to them so they can make a judgement about the impact of immigration on jobs			0
this should be done on the basis of fact not more empty rhetoric or spin from the government			0
‘ the government ’s record on immigration is one of failing to meet their own net migration target and ramping up the rhetoric			0
now they want to keep their own research hidden rather than scrutinised			0
‘ we need an open , calm and fact based debate on the impact of immigration and this should be facilitated by the government and not made harder			0
’ @entity89 's shadow immigration minister @entity92 said the public needed facts not empty rhetoric or spin from the government while @entity90 leader @entity123 said there was ' no doubt ' @entity126 had lost work as a result of an influx of labour from overseas @entity16 @entity90 leader @entity123 told @entity132 's today : ' i think there is no doubt that @entity16 people have lost their jobs because there is too much labour coming into the market			0
' the other factor , which is not in this report but is perhaps even more pertinent , is the effect on wages of people in work			2
' we have had wage compression and it has meant lower wages for millions and millions of people			2
' @entity62 mp @entity151 also joined calls for a swift publication : ' let 's put it kindly : it 's got stuck in someone 's in - tray waiting for the final sign - off , has n't it ? ' it would be very , very helpful if it was now extracted from that in - tray and published			2
' it sounds as though this is a very rigorous study ... a very important contribution to the factual debate on immigration which is sorely needed			2

home secretary claimed for every 100 immigrants , 23 *brits* are *jobless*
but new study by @entity176 officials says ' displacement ' much lower
@entity10 is *accused* of preventing publication of the internal report
