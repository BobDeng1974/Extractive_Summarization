official figures show the number of foreign born men and women in work soared by 334,000 to more than 4m the revelation , by the independent @entity19 , will fuel the explosive debate over ' @entity8 jobs for @entity8 workers '			1
earlier this month , @entity23 broke @entity24 ranks by warning that a new generation of young men and women will be condemned to a life on benefits without tougher measures to stem the flow of migrant workers			1
the @entity32 said that his expensive back - to - work schemes will fail without stricter controls			2
and he urged @entity8 businesses to give young people coming off welfare and back into employment a fair chance , and ' not just fall back on labour from abroad '			1
mr @entity23 's comments provoked a furious backlash from @entity8 business leaders who said that @entity8 youngsters were too lazy , ill - educated and lacking the work ethic to compete for jobs			1
outspoken : how the @entity47 reported @entity23 breaking @entity24 ranks over the migrant jobs situation on july 1 they also blamed the welfare system for not encouraging more unemployed @entity8 people to find work			1
recent figures show that @entity8 's population increased by nearly half a million last year , driven by high levels of immigration and rising birth rates			2
between 1997 and 2010 , more than half of the rise in employment in the @entity8 was accounted for by foreign nationals			1
sir @entity62 , chairman of @entity63 , said : ' it is impossible to look at these figures which show a substantially greater increase in the foreign - born workforce than in the @entity8 - born workforce without deducing that there has been a significant impact on the prospects for @entity8 workers			1
' there no point in being in denial about this			0
' @entity8 employers surely have a responsibility to consider the wider implications of who they employ			2
' the @entity19 figures showed that @entity8 unemployment as a whole has fallen by 26,000 in the three months to may to 2.45million			2
the unemployment rate was 7.7 per cent - down from 7.8 per cent in the previous quarter			0

of those , nearly half a million are women - an increase of 9,500 and the highest rise in women claiming unemployment benefits for 15 years			2
recent figures show that @entity8 's population increased by nearly half a million last year , driven by high levels of immigration and rising birth rates mr @entity23 's outspoken comments were highly unusual and were seen as a warning to prime minister @entity102 not to give in to @entity104 demands for a softer stance on immigration - an issue that remains close to the top of voters ' concerns			1
a source close to mr @entity23 said last night : ' these figures are exactly why @entity23 felt the need to speak out about this			0
' we are doing everything we can do to get people into jobs in the short term , but if businesses keep falling back on foreign labour , we are going to face this problem again and again			0
' he is very concerned about the impact of this on the economy			0
' the @entity19 yesterday stressed that the figures for the number of @entity129 - born people includes individuals who were born outside the country , but also have @entity8 nationality			1

the employment rate for @entity8 - born people aged from 16 to 64 was 71 per cent , compared with just 67.3 per cent for @entity129 - born people			1
the @entity19 statistics are also set to raise questions about the government 's decision to set a cap on the numbers of foreign migrants			0
some @entity146 officials are worried about the effect of the cap on tax receipts as the numbers of migrants contributing to the economy and paying taxes continues to increase			0
meanwhile , the @entity19 figures indicated that the number of new jobs created in the private sector was still outstripping government job losses with an extra half a million jobs created in the last year			0
there was also a drop in youth unemployment among 16 to 24 year - olds by 42,000 to just over 4million			2
chancellor @entity164 had been hoping for a strong boost to employment			0
but ministers yesterday admitted the figures showed that the government still faces a ' big economic challenge '			0
@entity171 , of consultancy @entity172 , warned : ' with the economy going through a very soft patch , the growth outlook muted and increasing job cuts on the way in the public sector , we strongly suspect that unemployment is headed up over the coming months			0
