our risk of blackouts this winter is at its highest for six years because @entity6 ’s reserves of electricity have halved in 12 months , @entity0 warned yesterday			1
the number of coal - based power plants operating across the @entity6 has fallen sharply because of @entity11 legislation which has caused older , polluting , fossil fuel plants to be turned off			1
the situation has been exacerbated as plans for some gas - fired plants have been suspended due to economic pressures			2
@entity6 is at its highest risk of winter blackouts in almost seven years , figures released by the @entity0 have revealed yesterday national grid director @entity20 said : ‘ things will be tighter than they have been historically			1
’ the report said @entity6 will have ‘ margins ’ of only 5 per cent , the lowest since 2007 , as it heads into the freezing months			1
the margin is the difference between the peak demand and the available supply from the @entity6 ’s power stations and import pipelines			1
if it gets too low , @entity0 can issue warnings to generators to begin producing more electricity to prevent a shortfall developing			0
but if these warnings do not work and the margin between supply and demand reaches zero , then parts of the country could experience blackouts			0
@entity45 landmark clock tower @entity43 is partly lit during a major power failure in the @entity6 capital in 2003			1
there could be more like this on the way the country ’s gas supplies also face ‘ considerable uncertainty ’ as dwindling @entity55 reserves now account for less than half of the @entity6 ’s supply , the company warned in its annual winter outlook @entity59 sharp and unexpected fall in wind power could push margins even lower			1
but mr @entity20 continued to insist last night that the lights would not go out			0
‘ while there have been power station closures since last winter , the information suggests that the market can meet demand in cold weather , ’ he said			1
‘ but as the system operator , we ’re never complacent			0
’ one fifth of the @entity6 ’s coal capacity has been closed down in the last year because of the @entity11 ’s emissions rules , even though it remains the cheapest way of producing electricity			1
last month , at the @entity79 conference in @entity80 , @entity77 pledged to freeze energy prices for almost two years following the next election if @entity79 wins			0
but industry experts have said it will deter investment at a time when @entity6 needs £ 110billion spent on new energy plants and updating the national grid			2
a prolonged cold snap , such as the one seen earlier this year , is likely to drain the @entity6 ’s gas reserves as millions of families keep the heating on to ward off the chill			2
the amount left in @entity95 , the @entity6 ’s largest store , hit a record low earlier in the year after freezing temperatures lasted longer than expected			2
last march @entity6 came within hours of running out of gas after one of the under - sea pipes that imports gas from the @entity103 broke down			2
critics said it showed that the country needed to build more gas storage facilities			0
currently the @entity6 has enough gas storage for only 21 days , while @entity110 neighbours can hold enough gas for 100 days			0
but last month ministers refused to offer subsidies to companies to build new storage @entity116 night fears over a future energy gap increased as industry sources told the @entity120 up to 15 planned gas fired power stations may never be built			0
the government was banking on 30 new gas power stations to produce a quarter of the @entity6 ’s energy and plug the gap left by coal closures			1
it comes after the @entity6 has failed to build enough new wind farms and power stations to replace the mothballed plants			1
but @entity0 experts said extra supplies of energy would come from the @entity103 if the country risked a supply shortage but now industry sources say energy companies are planning to pull the plug on up to 15 of the projects , worth a combined total of £ 19billion			0
@entity142 , chief executive of industry body @entity143 , said : ‘ @entity0 has demonstrated that the @entity6 ’s demand for energy is getting closer to the amount we can produce or buy in			2
‘ we have enough energy now but this timely report shows that investment is urgently needed to ensure we build the new power stations we are going to need			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity153 said : ‘ as the @entity0 have said , we have enough energy to meet our needs this winter			0
‘ our infrastructure can deliver more than we need and has coped well during recent very cold winter spells			0

@entity6 **'s** electricity *safety* ' *cushion* ' is just 5 per cent - half last year **'s** figure
the electricity margins are difference between peak demand and supply
comes after fall in coal - based power plants in operation across @entity6
but @entity171 insists supplies are enough to see @entity6 through the winter
