@entity34 ’s body was found near the @entity83 in @entity45 in october 2011 , about a month after her death			2
the couple got high and had oral sex with the teenage babysitter who died that night			2
gang member @entity87 said mr @entity6 called himself a ' watcher of the flock ' meaning that he felt it important that he be the one to help teens do drugs ' so they would n't go elsewhere and try it on their own '			1
trouble : at the time of @entity34 ' death , @entity6 was on parole for prior burglary and firearm charges , and he was also known to be part of the @entity101 , a white supremacist prison gang help : police reportedly received a confidential tip about the whereabouts of @entity34 ' body by members of @entity6 's gang one of @entity34 ' friends , whose name was not released , also testified in april last year that the two of them would go over to the @entity6 's house to smoke drugs , and that the 36 - year - old man was the one to teach them how to smoke methamphetamine out of a light bulb			1
@entity87 's statement , which was read in court , confirmed the account of the night given by mrs @entity32 , saying that @entity34 died in their home because of the drugs and they could not revive her			1
the letter also detailed mr @entity6 's rehashing of he and his wife 's sexual dalliances and drug use with the teen prior to her death			2
' i was paranoid and i did not want to be involved , ' wrote @entity87 , who is currently serving time for unknown charges			0
his motivation to help , however , was more personal : ' i have a 16 - year - old daughter			0
' @entity87 was not the only gang member who found the @entity6 's behavior to be an affront , as @entity140 has been identified as the police informant who tipped them off to the location of the body			2
serious charges : @entity6 , 36 , is charged with far more involvement than his wife , and is said to be the one who actually killed the girl by injecting her with drugs dark side : during her testimony , @entity32 said that @entity34 asked the couple if she could have sex with them in august 2011 - a month before she died - and also requested to be paid with meth instead of cash ' i wanted the family to have closure , ' mr @entity140 said			1

mrs @entity32 faces one third - degree felony charge relating to the disposal of @entity34 ’ body , but prosecutors have called her overall involvement ‘ minimal ’ as compared to mr @entity6 ’s , as he faces charges of child abuse homicide , unlawful sex with a minor , the disposal of the body and obstruction of justice			1
the 39 - year - old , who filed for divorce from her husband after they were charged with the death of @entity34 , told the torrid story of how the couple befriended and corrupted the young girl in the months leading up to her death			2
mrs @entity32 said that they started using @entity34 - or @entity208 as she called her - as a babysitter for their two daughters in the spring of 2011			1
accomplice : @entity32 , seen here in an earlier court appearance in 2012 , discussed how she helped her husband @entity215 dispose of @entity34 's body they became friends and started drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana with the teen before @entity34 began requesting that they try harder drugs like methamphetamine and heroin			1
eventually they even began paying @entity34 with meth			0
one of their most raucous nights as a group came in august , a month before her death , when @entity34 reportedly asked to become sexually involved with the married couple			2
' @entity215 and i started kissing and having sex			0
then @entity34 jumped in , ' mrs @entity32 told the court			2
on the fateful night of september 10th , the couple wanted @entity34 to babysit because they were going to go shopping for their daughter ’s birthday			2
neither babysitting nor shopping ended up happening			0
as soon as @entity34 arrived at the house , mr @entity6 helped her get high by injecting her with drugs - once with heroin and twice with meth - into her arm and neck			1
found : a full autopsy could not be performed because @entity34 ' body was so decomposed , but significant traces of heroin and meth were in her system then , when she was ‘ as high as she had ever been ’ , she and her husband performed oral sex on one another			2
mrs @entity32 says that she was not involved in the encounter			0
a short while later , the drugs had a negative effect on the teen and she started ‘ freaking out ’			0
she reportedly felt disoriented and cold , so she asked if she could take a warm bath in the couple ’s master bathroom			0
after leaving her alone in the bath at her request , the @entity67 checked on her about 45 minutes later to find that she was still cold , so mrs @entity32 wrapped her in a blanket and told her to lie down in another bedroom			0
the couple left her to go smoke some cigarettes , and returned about a half hour later to find her unresponsive			0
‘ she was n't breathing			0
she had mucousy stuff coming out of the right side of her mouth , ’ said mrs @entity32 , who was a licensed nurse and tried to resuscitate the girl to no avail			0
they then tried to figure out what to do next			0
‘ it really was a panic			0
the idea of it was , we will lose our kids and go to jail , and there was nothing we could do to bring her back , ’ she told the court			0
mr @entity6 was on parole at the time for prior burglary and firearm charges , and he was also known to be part of the @entity101 , a white supremacist prison gang			2
mrs @entity32 , who also had outstanding court dates due to her involvement with two unrelated prescription drug fraud and child endangerment cases , says that she dressed the then - naked body of @entity34 and put it into a foot locker which the couple moved into a box in the trunk of their car			1
leaving their 6 - year - old daughter at home but taking their toddler with them , they ' drove all over the place ' disposing of any evidence that may connect them to the crime			0
they dumped her body in a remote area of @entity45 where mr @entity6 covered it with brush and shrubs so that it was hidden			0
police only found it six weeks after @entity34 ’ death with the help of a confidential tip from @entity140 , one of mr @entity6 ’s gang members			1
moving on to the remaining evidence , they left @entity34 ' purse in one dumpster with the box that had held the body , then drove to a different dumpster where they left the carpet from the car ' in case there was any evidence on it '			0
