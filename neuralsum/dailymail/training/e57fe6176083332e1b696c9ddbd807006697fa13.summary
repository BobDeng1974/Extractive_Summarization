by @entity0 when it comes to re-inventing the razor , @entity1 has managed to pull off the feat hundreds of times			1
first it was two blades , then four , now five ... and the mens ' grooming company has come out with a head that swivels and adjusts according to the contours of your face			2
the new @entity14 is a razor that as the handle that moves , the head also angles and pivots			0
but such allegedly smooth perfection does n't come cheap			0
the razor will be on the market for $ 11.49 and will be one the most expensive out there			0
the battery - powered version costs even more with a suggested retail price of $ 12.59			0
' for more than a century , since @entity37 introduced the very first safety razor in 1901 , @entity1 has revolutionized the way the world shaves , fusing state - of - the - art engineering with precision manufacturing , ' said @entity43 , group president of @entity44 and @entity45			1
' @entity1 invented the original pivot , and we ’ve once again changed the shaving experience			2
the @entity14 with @entity49 is truly shaving rebuilt to deliver the best a man can get			0
' a closer shave : @entity1 has announced a newfangled , swiveling ball - hinge razor , which starting at $ 11.49 will be one of the most expensive razors on the market compatible : the handle will work with @entity58 existing @entity14 cartridges not everyone is convinced by @entity1 's own hype however			1
@entity62 , a marketing consultant based in @entity63 says he is getting sick of having to upgrade to a new razor almost every years			0
' men have been shaving since the stone age			0
i do n't see how this blade is going to make the slightest difference			0
whether you use a plastic razor , one with two blades , one with seventeen or whatever - point is , it 's just a money grabbing exercise and i 'm not going to fall for it			1
' @entity76 from @entity77 says he has recently joined the @entity78 and is saving a fortune on monthly blades			1
' only @entity37 could take as simple an activity as an everyday shave , spin it into a science full of marketing gimmicks , and charge a fortune for it			0
' @entity37 introduced the new technology at a launch event in @entity63 that featured live music , a shave of actor @entity90 and the usual company proclamations that its latest razor would change shaving as we know it			0
the new handle will work with @entity1 ’s existing @entity14 cartridges			2
the pairing of the new handle and the blades is a marketing tactic to boost sales of the brand ’s most expensive razor cartridges , which cost about $ 20 for a pack of four at stores			1
many @entity1 consumers continue to use the older and less expensive @entity107 system rather than adopting the @entity14 , which was introduced four years ago			2
@entity108 from @entity109 is similarly wary of @entity1 's new product			1
' @entity111 is a bad idea			0
in fact , the razor represents everything terrible about @entity21 's innovation economy			2
by now , everyone knows how razor companies make their money			2
they sell you cheap razor handles , then burn you later with expensive cartridge refills			0
on top of that business model , @entity1 and other market leaders introduced an arms - race component to the industry – going from two blades to three , then to four and five and six			1
each new blade adds only a smidgen of extra utility , but it convinced gullible customers that they needed to upgrade their models every few years to stay current			2
a few years ago , though , something happened that threatened @entity1 's dominance			1
upstarts like the @entity78 began exploiting the obvious – namely , that it should n't cost $ 20 for a pack of razor cartridge refills – and began to shave away ( sorry ) some of @entity1 's competitive edge by selling razors for cheaper over the internet			1
the shaving industry , as they say in @entity145 , had been disrupted			0
' @entity21 spent $ 3.7 billion on razors , blades , and shaving products in the 52 - week period ending march 15 , according to @entity150 data			1
that represents a decline of 2.7 percent from the previous year			0
@entity153 , which owns @entity1 controls about 80 percent of the @entity21 razor blade market and holds a 40 percent share of the disposable razor category			1
the new @entity1 blade will be available in stores by june .			1

new razor will be a dollar more than the current top - line @entity162
razors and blade sales have *dipped* recently
other companies such as @entity78 offer new blades more cheaply taking a substantial bite out of @entity1 's profits
