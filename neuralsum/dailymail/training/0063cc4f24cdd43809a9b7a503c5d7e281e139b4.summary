president @entity0 said thursday that @entity1 are committing political ' suicide ' by resisting his push for comprehensive immigration reform , and vowed to go ahead with plans to unilaterally loosen some immigration rules after the november 4 midterm elections			1
@entity0 wants @entity1 in the @entity8 to call a vote on legislation that passed in the @entity11 last year , but any move toward what conservatives see as an ' amnesty ' for more than 11 million lawbreakers has been a nonstarter			1
' whatever i do through the executive branch will not be as effective as we could do through legislation , ' @entity0 told a small audience of tech startup entrepreneurs at a town hall - style event in @entity26 , @entity27			1
' and it ’s anybody ’s guess how republicans are thinking about this			0
' ' if they were thinking long - term politically , it is suicide for them not to do this			0
because the demographics of the country are such where you are going to lose an entire generation of immigrants who are looking around and saying , " you know what ? that party does not seem to care much about me and my life "			0
' ' and i think the smarter republicans understand this , ' @entity0 jabbed			2
@entity0 spoke at @entity48 , a hub for startup companies and entrepreneurs in @entity26 , poking republicans for ignoring demographic trends and stubbornly resisting immigration reform pivot : the president turned a narrow question about technical - skills work visas into an expansive stemwinder about the fate of 11 million illegal immigrants ' short term , though , ' he claimed , ' they ’ve got a problem in the tea party and others who oftentimes express virulently anti-immigrant sentiment			1
' the president conceded that ' two or three weeks of publicity ' this summer that followed a flood of unaccompanied children and teens across the southern @entity75 border ' fanned concern ' about the impact of telling the world that @entity79 has changed its immigration calculus			1
but he insisted that ' it will happen over the next two years			0
' ' this is going to get fixed , ' @entity0 vowed , ' and @entity83 will see the light , because the logic of it is – it ’s too compelling			2
' he explained that while @entity79 's native - born population is reproducing at rates comparable to those in @entity90 and @entity91 , while first - generation @entity75 immigrants are responsible for most of the population growth			1
@entity90 is aging , ' he said			0
' we are younger than them			0
and younger populations grow faster			0
you have more workers , fewer retirees			0
' @entity0 cited what he said was an economic consensus that if the @entity11 bill passed in 2013 were to become law , the @entity75 would see ' faster growth , lower deficits , a more dynamic economy , more startups			1
' the president had been asked a question about a more narrow immigration issue related to limits on the @entity115 visa program , which high - tech industries want broadened to attract more high - skilled talent from overseas			2
before launching into a political stemwinder , he pledged to make the @entity115 system more efficient ' to encourage more folks to stay here			0
' but most of @entity0 's immigration talking points were aimed straight at the @entity1 , which hopes to expand its @entity8 majority and wrest back control of the @entity11 during what will be @entity0 's last two years in office			1
' deporter - in - chief ' : @entity0 regularly hears immigration reform demands from the @entity131 wing of his party , like these protesters who yelled outside his speech on oct. 2 to the @entity135 shifting the control of just six @entity11 seats would give @entity1 the majority they seek – and create more intense headaches for @entity0 , who has n't yet had to deal with a @entity1 - led @entity83 united against him			1
a @entity141 run exclusively by the @entity1 would be a death knell for @entity0 's immigration policy dreams , @entity11 aides say			1
it would also likely bring new obstacles to implementing the @entity147 medical insurance law , open new levels of scrutiny into a lengthening tally of scandals plaguing the @entity152 , and roll back some of the administration 's energy , environmental and homeland security policies			2
that outlook , however , depends upon internal dynamics in the @entity1 that see a hard - line @entity159 bloc battling against a more moderate majority over whether to risk an electoral backlash by toeing a conservative line			2
one senior aide to a western - @entity11 @entity1 told @entity165 on thursday that immigration ' will be the last thing a @entity1 - led @entity11 would ever tackle in the next @entity83			1
' ' i do n't care what the go - along , get - along crowd says , ' the official said			0
' we 've been down that road once , and the president never lets us hear the end of it			0
' ' sometimes it 's better just to let bad ideas die on the vine			0

president hosted a town hall - style meeting attended by tech entrepreneurs in @entity26 , @entity27
he jabbed the @entity1 for *opposing* ' comprehensive immigration reform ' by *blocking* legislation in the @entity8 that has already passed the @entity11
@entity0 *favors* establishing a pathway to citizenship for more than 11 million *people* living in the @entity75 illegally
@entity1 reject ' amnesty ' for illegal immigrants and want *tighter* border security and more deportations
big business , usually more *aligned* with the @entity1 , has rallied around @entity0 's immigration reform push because it promises to *provide* a steady stream of cheap labor from @entity203 and @entity79
