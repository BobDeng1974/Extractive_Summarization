nice guy image : @entity1 closed two @entity3 stores without giving employees any notice @entity1 has closed two of his cooking class shops - but failed to tell staff until they were abruptly cleared out of the premises during a shift			1
customers with bookings were also not informed of the sudden decision , and many found out just days before their classes were meant to take place after ringing up to ask for directions or confirmation			2
the star chef shut down his @entity21 branches in @entity22 and @entity23 after five years of operation - with a spokesman claiming they were now ' focusing energies on their flagship @entity29 branch '			1
but one customer , who called the business to complain about a cancelled booking , says a despondent former employee temporarily posted to customer services admitted the stores were ' making no money '			1
another former worker at the @entity23 store has labelled the move ' heartless and shameful '			1
the part - time employee , a student who did not want to be named , claims a woman from head office came in to the store to close the place down - and customers and staff had to leave the premises immediately			1
he told @entity50 : ' they literally just came in at lunch , kicked out customers , shut the doors and hey presto			2
it was one lady from @entity57 head office			1
' our food champs were renowned for there incredible work and classes			2
' to be just sacked off just like that			0
shameful , as if he could n't afford to keep us open a few more weeks so we could have a proper send off			2
' i was offered one week 's wages , woopey do ! very heartless thing to do considering our loyalty and hard work towards the company			1
' the worst part is not even being able to thank regulars for their custom face to face			0
instead having a " poster in the window " job			0
' another member of staff , from the @entity22 store , claimed she turned up to work last monday to find the doors locked and said workers were appalled by the last - minute decision			1
the @entity21 stores were opened in 2009 to create ‘ buzzing little community hubs where people can really get involved with food ’			1
classes at the shop can cost up to £ 65 for a two - hour session , teaching a range of varying cuisines from @entity94 street food to @entity95 mince pies			2

' a spokesman for @entity1 's company today confirmed that workers had not been given advance warning of the decision , saying : ' i 'm told no - one turned up to find the doors closed but yes staff did find out on the day of closure			1
' ' obviously it was a very difficult decision to close the stores			0
a consultation process has already begun with @entity21 staff affected and we have found alternative employment within the business for many of them			2
' ' as for the customers affected , although there is understandable disappointment , all are in the process of being reimbursed or their classes moved to the flagship @entity3			2
