warning : lord judge , the former lord chief justice , has warned the @entity1 has too much power over-mighty @entity4 judges are undermining the power of @entity6 to make laws , one of @entity10 ’s most senior judges has warned			1
lord judge , lord chief justice of england and @entity12 until september , delivered an unequivocal message on the actions of the @entity15 : ‘ stop here			1
’ his remarks will give encouragement to @entity19 ministers seeking to rein in abuse of human rights laws by criminals , terror suspects and illegal immigrants			0
they come as the president of the @entity4 court , judge @entity25 warned @entity10 's ban on prisoner voting is a breach of international law			1
earlier this month , prime minister @entity33 called for the court 's powers to be restricted			1
he said @entity10 ' damned well should n't ' be forced by @entity4 judges to give prisoners the vote if @entity6 decides they should be barred from elections			1
judge @entity25 warned any attempt by @entity10 to pull away from the @entity43 could set the @entity10 on a path to leaving the @entity45 altogether			2
speaking on the @entity47 4 today programme , lord judge , said : ' the most fundamental principle of our unwritten constitution is parliamentary sovereignty			1
' our elected representatives have ultimate sovereignty not only over our own unelected judges but in my view over the unelected judges of any other jurisdiction , including @entity4 , unless we choose to give them sovereignty			1
' my very strong belief is that this issue now needs to be resolved by @entity6 , ' he said			1
' this is a court which is not answerable to anybody , ' he added			2
' if it 's right , it ca n't be overruled by anybody			0
risk : his remarks come as judge @entity25 , president of the @entity4 court ( pictured ) , warned that @entity10 's ban on prisoner voting could risk the country having to leave the @entity45 altogether ' i genuinely do n't think that a body of judges - however distinguished - should have that sort of power			1
' lord judge , who declared himself a supporter of the @entity43 , said the court 's claims have implications for every @entity45 nation , not just the @entity10			1
he said : ' his ( judge @entity25 's ) view means that the court in @entity4 is entitled to tell every country in @entity4 how it should organise itself			1
' he refers to it as a living instrument			0
of course the convention is n't a dead instrument , but it means that legislation can be made by judges on all sorts of societal issues - binding legislation - and if that 's the position there is a very serious problem with sovereignty			1
' it 's not a @entity10 problem , the sovereignty issue affects every single country in @entity4			1
' he added : ' it is time for us to recognise that it is a very important time			0
my own view is : stop here			0
' judge @entity25 , however , insisted that the @entity10 should not defy the court 's ruling on prisoner voting rights			1
' this would be clearly inconsistent with the international law obligations of the @entity10 and also the obligations under the convention , ' he told the today programme			0
he said that if @entity10 sought to pull out of the convention - as some @entity19 mps are demanding - it would mean leaving the @entity124 , the body which created the @entity1 , and ultimately the @entity45			0
' i can not see how the @entity10 could remain a member of the @entity124 while at the same time withdrawing from the @entity43 , ' he said			0
prime minister @entity33 said there is no chance of prisoners getting the vote during this government ' all the members of the @entity45 are also members of the @entity124			0
i can hardly see how a member of the @entity45 could withdraw from the @entity124			0
i see a problem there			0
' i think from a political perspective it might be very difficult to stay in the @entity45			0
' in a strongly - worded attack on interference from @entity141 , mr @entity33 called for the @entity1 to have its wings clipped earlier this month			0
the defiant remarks put the government on a collision course with judges who have ruled that the @entity10 's blanket ban on votes for those behind bars is a breach of their human rights			2
in february last year the @entity153 called for the blanket ban to be maintained by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22 , despite repeated warnings from @entity141			0
mr @entity33 said : ' if @entity6 decides that prisoners should not get the vote then i think they damn well should n't			1
' he added : ' it should be a national decision taken in our @entity6			2
' the @entity162 said the court 's powers must be restricted , telling workers ' we need to clip its wings '			2
the prisoner voting row has been running since 2005 , when @entity141 judges ordered @entity10 to give the vote to convicted prisoners , who have historically been considered to have removed themselves from the electorate			2
despite overwhelming votes in favour of maintaining the law in the @entity153 , the @entity4 judges have continued to repeat their instructions			2
in 2010 mr @entity33 said it makes him ' physically ill ' to even contemplate having to give the vote to anyone in prison			0
and in october last year he added : ' no one should be under any doubt - prisoners are not getting the vote under this government			0

former lord chief justice said @entity4 court is *threatening* to undermine the sovereignty of @entity6
he *questioned* whether any judge has the right to ' have that sort of power '
comes amid @entity199 's *refusal* to overturn ban on prisoners voting
