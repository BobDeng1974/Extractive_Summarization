the highly - decorated general , 60 , had recently traveled to @entity7 and the @entity15 , and was to testify about the @entity17 attack next week behind closed doors to the @entity20 and @entity21 intelligence committees			1
bad timing : @entity2 ' resignation comes at a sensitive time ; the @entity10 chief was slated to testify at the @entity17 hearings next week fears have also emerged as his resignation comes at an extremely sensitive time			1
the administration and the @entity10 have struggled to defend security and intelligence lapses before the attack that killed the @entity6 ambassador to @entity7 and three others			1
shocking : @entity2 resigned after an @entity37 investigation on his biographer @entity38 was revealed it was an issue during the presidential campaign that ended with @entity42 's re-election tuesday			2

his sudden departure threatened to usher in a period of instability at the spy agency , which is grappling with a leveling off in its budget after a decade of steady increases			0
the agency is also fending off questions about its performance before and after the attack that led to the death of @entity6 ambassador @entity54 in @entity17 , @entity7			2
@entity6 officials insisted that the @entity10 's handling of the @entity17 incident had nothing to do with @entity2 ' decision to resign			1
the @entity10 has come under intense scrutiny for providing the @entity20 and other administration officials with talking points that led them to say the @entity17 attack was a result of a film protest , not a militant terror attack			2
it has become clear that the @entity10 was aware the attack was distinct from the film protests roiling across other parts of the @entity72 world			2
@entity73 rather than @entity2 now is expected to testify at closed congressional briefings next week on the sept. 11 attacks on the consulate in @entity17			1
according to the @entity77 , @entity2 told the @entity20 of the affair , only one day after @entity42 secured a second term in the @entity20			2

’ chiming in with her own conspiracy theory , conservative talk show radio host @entity125 wrote : ‘ cia chief @entity127 resignation … something about this stinks to high heaven			1
’ she added : ‘ coincidence ? ! @entity2 is set to testify next week at a closed door session on @entity131 about @entity17			1
did bho push him out ? this stinks ! ’ but some , like @entity134 founder @entity133 , reacted to the news in a very forgiving fashion			0
‘ turns out @entity2 is ( sic ) human being			0
and of course we definitely ca n’t have human beings in government ! ’ she wrote			0

failure to resign also could create the perception for the rank - and - file that such behavior is acceptable			0
at @entity37 headquarters , spokesman @entity167 declined to comment on the information that the affair had been discovered in the course of an investigation by the bureau			0

' but there is no indication that he broke any agency rule in connection with his admitted affair , sources familiar with the matter said			0
the @entity10 has no broad rule banning officials from engaging in extramarital affairs , though if discovered , liaisons by @entity10 personnel with suspected foreign agents would pose security problems for a @entity6 spy			0
@entity42 , who accepted @entity2 ' resignation in a phone call with him friday afternoon , said that @entity73 , the agency 's long - time deputy director , would serve as acting @entity10 chief			1
@entity73 , who is well respected at both the @entity20 and on @entity131 , had previously served as acting director following the departure of former @entity10 chief @entity208			2

' such behavior is unacceptable , both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours			0
' saddened : @entity20 aides said that president @entity42 did not immediately accept @entity2 ' resignation , but later wished him the best , ' i wish ( he and his wife @entity228 ) the very best at this difficult time ' reliable : then - president @entity265 , right , was very close to @entity2 , left , who was then in charge of the @entity267 @entity42 , who was re-elected to a second term on tuesday , said in a statement that he accepted @entity2 ' resignation , praising him for his work at the @entity10 and for leading @entity6 troops in @entity272 and @entity273			1
the sudden and dramatic turn of events appeared to end the public career of a widely admired man who played a key role in the @entity272 war , led the @entity280 and commanded @entity6 and @entity281 troops in @entity273			0
@entity2 ' name had circulated speculatively as a possible @entity284 presidential nominee before @entity42 tapped him as @entity10 chief			2
