by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity3 agents in @entity5 's @entity4 angered a black congressman in 1993 after forcing him to show his id and searching his car before allowing him to attend a meeting with then - vice president @entity10			1
a white driver taking @entity14 @entity13 rep. @entity12 to his meeting was admitted without an id - check			1
a staffer 's memo to @entity5 a week later warned the president about the incident before a scheduled photo - op including @entity12 and the mayor of a @entity24 suburb			1
president @entity5 ( r ) leaned on rep. @entity12 ( @entity26 ) to use his leverage with the @entity28 during legislative fights			1
but in 1993 @entity12 could n't get in the @entity4 without an @entity7 check and a car search @entity12 ( c , seated ) , was a civil rights icon in @entity14 and served on the @entity34 that investigated the killing of rev. @entity36 the memo from a senior aide described rep. @entity12 ' disgust at being subjected to what he thought was racial profiling @entity12 , a legend in the civil - rights history of @entity14 's populous @entity44 , was beside himself			1
rep. @entity12 was asked for identification , although his white driver was not , ' @entity45 , then @entity4 deputy director of legislative affairs , wrote to @entity5			1
' furthermore , before rep. @entity12 was allowed in the gate , a k - 9 detail searched his car			1
rep. @entity12 is understandably furious and believes the search to be racially motivated			2
' @entity12 , she wrote , had used his position as an appropriations subcommittee chairman to be ' very helpful to the @entity57			2
' ' for your information , @entity58 has spoken at length with @entity62 about the incident			0
@entity0 has taken steps to insure that in the future @entity67 driving , into the @entity4 will be admitted expeditiously and will be treated with respect			2
' @entity62 , then @entity4 director of administration , was fired a year later for using a presidential helicopter to ferry himself and friends to a @entity73 golf outing			2
@entity5 's political second act has been marred by revelations in his administration 's archives , which were set for release a year ago but delayed by archivists			0
@entity80 , the former first lady , went on to become a @entity1 senator and secretary of state -- and is now mulling her own @entity4 run @entity12 ( @entity26 ) stood alongside @entity5 in 1998 when he signed a law directing the @entity85 to spend $ 500,000 per year to connect sites along the old @entity87 , a secret system used by black slaves to escape the @entity90 in the years before the @entity91 an earlier set of @entity94 documents released on march 1 included a note to the president from aide @entity97 , who explained that @entity12 was ' the key to the @entity28 ' if then - first lady @entity80 's health care overhaul were to become law			1
image problem : vice president @entity10 got so little public praise from president @entity5 that his staffers started begging for it ' it 's important that he hear from you , ' @entity97 wrote			1
' i am convinced , though , that such " stroking " will pay dividends			0
' @entity97 recently left the @entity4 after a second tour of service , where he was president @entity113 's behind - the - scenes point man on the implementation of the @entity116			1
the more than 7,500 pages released friday sparked the fourth media feeding frenzy since the first batch went online on february 28			0
the latest collection saw vice president @entity10 's staff practically begging @entity5 to say positive things about their boss in public toward the end of his administration			1
' i am trying to knock down the idea that the @entity94 ’s support for @entity10 is based on legacy notions , ' one @entity10 aide wrote his @entity132 counterpart , ' and build up the idea that it is based on respect , relationships and in - the - foxhole camaraderie			2
' ' also , some kind words about his very competent staff are always welcome			0
' @entity10 's handlers , already looking ahead to a 2000 election race that the vp would lose , were desperate for a presidential hat - tip to ' @entity10 as one of the guys ' – a wink of approval that ' rebuts the charge that @entity10 lacks a @entity5 type of feel for political rhetoric			2
' meanwhile , the document cache sheds some light on how mrs. @entity80 , who now faces a possible presidential run of her own , was worrying @entity4 aides because of a significant image problem			0
first lady @entity80 wound up ' getting real ' in a different way after her husband 's infidelities were exposed , but initially her handlers wanted the public to see a softer side of the future senator while she came to @entity164 with sky - high favorability numbers , the undated memo remarks on how those metrics turned south			0
' obviously , this is partly the handiwork of the radical right and the radio talk show hosts who have much to gain by painting an unflattering portrait of you , ' it reads			0
' [ s ] ome @entity1 ca n’t handle smart , tough , independent women			0
and that ’s the image most @entity1 have of you			0
' while the first lady 's close acquaintances know her as a warm and caring person with an everywoman streak , the memo advised , ' the public does n’t know it ' unless she engages in some publicity stunts to ' get real			0
' the suggested solution was to showcase her in a series of public appearances carefully calibrated to make her seem more ordinary – including ' shopping frantically for @entity191 presents , caroling ( maybe with @entity193 and some of her friends ) during the holiday season , working out , [ or ] making scrambled eggs for sunday brunch			0

@entity12 was a @entity24 , @entity14 *lawmaker* and the ' key to the @entity28 '
a @entity5 aide warned the president before a 1993 photo - op with @entity12 that he had been stopped a week earlier when entering the @entity4
secret service agents made him show his id , but never asked his white driver to do the same , in an early example of alleged racial profiling
@entity12 ' car was also searched by a drug - *sniffing* k - 9 unit before he could enter for a meeting with vice president @entity10
the memo was in the latest batch of files released by the @entity217
