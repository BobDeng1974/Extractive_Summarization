by @entity0 published : 19:17 est , 15 september 2013 updated : 09:27 est , 16 september 2013 ' too posh ' : @entity1 is failing to connect with female voters @entity1 suffered a double blow yesterday with two new polls showing he is haemorrhaging support in marginal seats and among women voters			1
one survey found that @entity10 ’s lead is widening in the 40 seats mr @entity1 must win because @entity13 voters are defecting to @entity14			1
in 32 seats where @entity10 is challenging the @entity13 , @entity16 ’s lead has grown from 9 to 14 points over the last two years			1
that would put @entity10 on course for a majority of 60 in 2015 , suggests the survey by former @entity13 donor @entity23			2
a separate survey commissioned by the @entity26 website suggests @entity10 is now 13 points ahead because women see mr @entity1 as too posh and ‘ out of touch ’			1
the poll , carried out by @entity31 , found that 42 per cent of women would back @entity10 , compared with 29 per cent who would vote @entity13			1
among women aged 18 - 34 the gap widens to a 25 - point @entity10 lead			2
@entity37 , chief executive of @entity26 , said : ‘ on the key issues of the economy and employment and particularly where the cuts have fallen , women feel like there is a lack of someone looking out for their interests			0
‘ one bit of the narrative [ about @entity1 ] that stands up is this elitist @entity52 - @entity51 man who does n’t quite get women			2
’ @entity10 is even ahead even among professional women who traditionally back the @entity13			1
in the 32 where @entity10 was second in 2010 , there has been an 8.5 per cent swing from the @entity58 to @entity10			0
that is enough for @entity10 to win all 32 seats and another 66 similar constituencies that lord @entity23 did not survey			0
way with the ladies : @entity16 , pictured kissing wife @entity64 , is doing significantly better both in general polls and with women voters crucially , the poll reveals that since 2011 , @entity10 has lost support in the marginal seats , but is benefiting from @entity13 defections to @entity14			1
@entity10 ’s support has dropped 1 per cent over the last two years from 44 to 43 per cent , but @entity13 support has dropped six points from 35 per cent to 29 per cent and @entity14 is now on 11 per cent			1
lord @entity23 said the @entity58 faced a ‘ formidable ’ challenge			0
‘ the tripling of @entity14 ’s vote share in marginal seats since 2010 threatens to put @entity16 in @entity84 in spite of @entity10 ’s lukewarm appeal , ‘ he said			2
the results fuelled demands by some @entity13 mps for the party to strike a general election pact with @entity14 before the polls in 2015			2
one @entity13 mp said : ‘ the doom and gloom has been replaced with complacency in recent weeks			0
‘ this should make @entity84 focus again			0
’ @entity92 , the shadow minister for women , said @entity1 had a ‘ blind spot ’ with women			0
‘ under this government , we have a cost of living crisis that is hitting women hardest – yet @entity1 and @entity100 do n’t even seem to notice or care			0
these figures show women are fed up with how out of touch the government is with their lives			0

poll shows @entity13 voters are defecting to @entity14
women chose @entity10 as @entity1 is ' too posh and out of touch '
