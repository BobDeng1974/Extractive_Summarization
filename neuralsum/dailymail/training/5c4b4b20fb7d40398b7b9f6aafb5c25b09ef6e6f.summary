the @entity0 said monday that president @entity1 is prepared to go it alone – ' regardless of borders ' – if he decides to launch airstrikes against the @entity5 inside @entity6			1
' i 'm not going to speculate about what sort of congressional approval would be requested or required ' if the president decided to chase @entity5 across the invisible border between @entity12 and @entity6 , spokesman @entity7 told reporters			1
he noted that @entity1 ' has not made a decision to order additional military action in @entity6			2
' but ' the president has already demonstrated a willingness , ' @entity7 insisted , ' to use military force to protect the @entity20 people , regardless of borders			0
no such welcome has been extended by @entity42 , the decidedly anti-american dictator in @entity43			0
@entity5 enjoys influence across a wide swath of land in both @entity12 and @entity6 , presenting the @entity47 with the possibility that decisive victories in @entity12 could drive the group to safe haven in @entity42 's country			1
defeating them there could present the @entity47 with an unwelcome outcome if the terror group 's forces regroup inside @entity6			0
@entity5 also represents a threat to @entity42 's rule , meaning that crushing @entity5 once and for all could have the unintended consequence of strengthening the strongman			2
calling on the example of @entity64 raid that killed @entity66 leader @entity65 on @entity68 soil , @entity7 suggested monday that @entity42 's assent to chase @entity5 past where @entity12 territory ends would n't be required			1
' the @entity20 was not invited in by the @entity68 government ' to take out @entity65 , @entity7 reminded reporters			1
' that was a decision the president made			0
' but members of @entity23 were kept in the loop about the @entity65 raid for months as tactical options were weighed			2
one aide to a @entity80 who serves on the @entity81 told @entity82 that if @entity1 were to make a unilateral move in @entity6 , his boss ' would be beyond upset			1
' ' no one wants it to come to that , given how much friction there already is between the @entity0 and about half of [ @entity94 ] @entity93 right now , ' he said			0
a spokesman for the @entity96 told @entity82 that rep. @entity97 , the committee 's chairman , is even more concerned with @entity1 's failure to present @entity23 and the @entity20 people with a coherent strategy for defeating @entity5			1
@entity7 took pains to point out that @entity1 had ' hosted a meeting here the last week that @entity23 was in town ' in july , ' where he invited up members – both democrats and @entity80 , from both the @entity0 and the @entity81 – to talk through some of these issues			1
' @entity6 dictator @entity42 ( @entity109 ) could be a big winner if @entity1 sweeps into his country and rids it of @entity5 , but rep. @entity97 ( r ) says @entity1 has n't come up with a plan to fight @entity5 -- much less a request to @entity23 for military authority ' there 's also consultation that can be done , and has been done , at the staff level , ' @entity7 said			1
' but in terms of what may be required if the president were to take or order a specific action , i 'm just not in a position to speculate			0
' @entity1 sought permission from @entity23 nearly a year ago to launch military strikes against @entity42 , after international observers reported that his regime used chemical weapons against rebel groups that had opposed him since 2011			1
' the military has positioned assets in the region , ' he said in an august 31 , 2013 speech			0
' we are prepared to strike whenever we choose , and i am prepared to give that order			0
' but he added that he would ' seek authorization for the use of force from the @entity20 people 's representatives in @entity23			2
' @entity1 made it clear then that he believed he had the authority to strike without the say - so of @entity23 , but said that he believed @entity20 would emerge ' stronger ' if he involved legislators			2
@entity7 said monday that there are no lessons to be taken from that episode			0
' that was a different situation , right ? ' he said , ' precisely because what the president was talking about in that scenario was ensuring that the @entity42 regime did n't use chemical weapons , or would pay a price for what the intel community had assessed was his use of chemical weapons			0
' ' what we 're talking about now is n't the @entity42 regime , but about this threat that 's posed by @entity5 ' – the @entity0 's preferred name for @entity5 – ' that 's operating both in @entity12 and in @entity6			1
' ' these are complicated situations and they always will be , ' @entity7 added later			0
' but what 's not complicated is the president 's willingness to act decisively and authoritatively in ordering military strikes to protect the @entity20 people			0

spokesman @entity7 compared the idea to killing @entity65 in @entity68 without permission from that nation 's government
' i 'm not going to speculate ' about whether @entity1 would ask @entity23 before launching airstrikes in @entity6 , his press secretary said
a @entity96 spokesman says @entity1 first needs to articulate a clear strategy to defeat @entity5 – which he has n't done
a @entity81 aide told @entity82 that his boss , who sits on that body 's @entity81 , would be ' beyond upset ' if @entity1 acts unilaterally
@entity12 's *faltering* government invited the @entity20 to take action against @entity5 , but @entity42 has n't rolled out @entity6 's welcome *mat*
@entity7 suggested @entity1 would follow the example of the @entity65 kill raid – an operation he authorized without permission from @entity68
