@entity0 was roundly criticised today after calling for @entity2 citizens travelling to @entity3 and @entity4 to automatically be stripped of their passports			2
@entity6 , a former @entity7 security chief , said the threat from @entity9 was ‘ unproven ’ and needed to be better understood before new laws were rushed through			1
deputy prime minister @entity11 added that new legislation to combat the threat posed by @entity2 jihadists returning from the @entity15 would not remove the danger from @entity18 extremists			1
former @entity7 security chief @entity6 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) have dismissed @entity0 's call for new laws to strip @entity2 citizens of their passports for travelling to @entity3 or @entity4 @entity21 mayor @entity0 said he would like to see ' @entity22 ' killed in a bomb attack on @entity4 intelligence agencies are close to identifying the brutal killer of @entity27 journalist @entity26 , believed to be a @entity2 extremist who has been dubbed ‘ jihadi @entity22 ’			1
mr @entity0 said @entity2 must take on @entity9 and ‘ try to close it down now ’ , warning that doing nothing would mean a ‘ tide of terror will eventually lap at our own front door ’			1
the mayor , who has overall responsibility for the @entity36 , called for new laws that would mean anyone visiting @entity3 and @entity4 would be automatically presumed to be terrorists unless they had notified the authorities in advance			1
writing in his @entity43 column , mr @entity0 said : ‘ young men such as this killer are famously told that if they die in ' battle ' they will be welcomed in heaven by the sexual ministrations of 72 virgins			1
‘ many of them believe it - even though scholars have suggested that the reference to ' black - eyed virgins ' is in fact a promise of 72 raisins			0
i suspect most of us do n't give a monkey 's what happens to this prat in heaven , whether he meets virgins or raisins - we just want someone to come along with a bunker buster and effect an introduction as fast as possible			0
’ but mr @entity6 , former global counter-terrorism director of @entity7 , told @entity70 : ‘ this fundamental tenet of @entity2 justice should not be changed even in a minor way for this unproven threat - and it is an unproven threat at the moment			1
’ he said the government needed to understand better the domestic threat posed by @entity9 before introducing new laws			2
‘ i do n't think we should change the laws without a very much more thorough assessment and understanding of the threat , ’ he said			0
‘ sure , there 's a problem with people who go to @entity4 and they may have broken the law if they joined organisations like @entity18 and @entity87 , but there should be some sort of effort to prove that , rather than assume they 've done so			0
’ and former attorney general @entity93 said mr @entity0 's suggestion that those travelling to @entity3 and @entity4 should be presumed guilty was ‘ draconian ’			1
one suspect in the brutal murder of @entity27 journalist @entity26 is the @entity2 23 - year - old @entity99 abdel @entity100 @entity100 - an amateur rapper from @entity21 - is believed to have travelled to @entity4 last year			0
his @entity102 - born father was extradited from @entity21 to the @entity103 in 2012 for his alleged connection to @entity105 and the @entity106 in @entity107 speaking during a visit to @entity109 , mr @entity11 added : ‘ i think the issue is incredibly important , that we should make sure that those young men , and it is invariably young men , who are attracted to this hateful ideology that draws them to the bloodshed and conflict in places like @entity4 and @entity3 , they should n't be able to come back and do harm on the streets of @entity2 towns , villages and cities , and that is now our number one priority			2
‘ it 's what the police , the authorities and security services are working flat out on ; i have huge confidence in the outstanding work they do			0
‘ with the greatest respect to @entity0 , i will listen to what they tell me they need rather than what he says			0
‘ we actually have a number of measures already on the statute book which allow us to keep a very close eye on those people who are n't in prison , are n't sentenced , but nonetheless are perceived to be a threat to the @entity2			0
‘ and of course , we will continue to review all the powers on the recommendation of the police and security services that may be deemed to be necessary to deal with this very serious issue			0
’ he added : ‘ i sometimes wish it was as simple as @entity0 implies : all we need to do is pass a law and everything will be well			2

said anyone in war zone should be automatically presumed to be a terrorist
added that he wanted ' @entity22 ' to be killed with a bunker busting bomb
but former @entity7 man @entity6 said the threat from @entity9 was ' unproven '
