@entity0 's rich are even more well off that we originally thought , a new study has found			2
the top 1 percent of @entity0 earners were previously estimated to control 30 per cent of the country 's wealth but it seems that number could be closer to 37 per cent			1
a new working paper from @entity10 senior economist @entity9 claims 30 percent is a lowball estimate of the net worth of the nation 's elite because wealthier households are less likely to respond to surveys about their assets than lower - income families			1
@entity19 : @entity21 founder @entity20 , pictured , tops the @entity22 billionaires list @entity9 analyzed data from @entity22 ' billionaires lists to estimate the share of the 1 percent is in fact between 35 percent and 37 percent			1
' our knowledge of the wealth distribution is less than perfect , ' @entity9 writes in the paper			0
' our results clearly indicate that survey wealthy estimates are very likely to underestimate wealth at the top			0
' the @entity37 is the best source of information on wealth distribution , asking questions about all asset holdings and debts of the household			0
however , a large chunk of the wealthy sample families do n't respond , or only respond in part , because they 're away , too busy , or they refuse to reveal sensitive information for example			2
@entity52 that using the @entity51 's billionaires list gave him a better idea of the jaw - dropping wealth in each country , and in turn account for that missing data			2
he said getting the wealth break down of the @entity0 correct helps both economic researchers and policy makers as it guides fiscal policy			0
the paper found the @entity0 was not alone in underestimating how rich its rich are			0
other countries also downplayed the assets of their 1 percent , with many @entity69 nations having a significant gap between the richest household recorded by their equivalent survey and the poorest billionaire on the @entity22 list			1
@entity9 's research may also suggest that the wealth controlled by the richest 5 percent in @entity0 , which was always thought to be a huge 60 percent , may also be more			1
the men and women on the @entity22 ' billionaires list have an aggregate wealth of $ 6.7 trillion .			0

a new working paper from a @entity10 senior economist wealthier households are less likely to respond to surveys about their assets than lower - income families
this is because they are away , too busy or *hesitant* to answer questions *honestly* about their wealth
