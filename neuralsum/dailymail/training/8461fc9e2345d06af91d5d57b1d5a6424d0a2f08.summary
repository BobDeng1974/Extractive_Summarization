@entity0 take 3 - 0 lead in series and regain the ashes @entity4 lose by 150 runs in @entity6 @entity7 takes final wicket , getting @entity9 @entity0 eyeing 5 - 0 whitewash by @entity11 published : 00:47 est , 17 december 2013 updated : 06:44 est , 17 december 2013 the @entity3 were lost to @entity4 today with their third successive defeat by @entity0 but in the figure of @entity14 they at least can take considerable consolation from their failure to retain the most precious prize in cricket			1
the 22 - year - old from @entity20 , thrown into this series in @entity22 more in desperation than hope , struck a maiden @entity26 century of considerable maturity to keep @entity0 waiting for a moment of triumph that had seemed guaranteed			2
@entity4 , so bereft of runs from all their leading batsmen so far , went into the final day of the third test needing a miracle if they were to pull off the highest successful run chase in the history of test cricket			2
video : scroll down for @entity11 : @entity4 have been completely and utterly outplayed winning feeling : the @entity0 team and staff celebrate their well - deserved @entity3 victory return of the urn : the scoreboard tells the story as @entity0 's players celebrate winning the ashes drink it in , boys : the @entity49 team celebrate by wasting beer in the dressing room have some fizz , coach : @entity55 tips drink on @entity56 striking a pose : @entity7 stands with his arms outstretched after taking @entity4 's final wicket souvenir : @entity61 grabs a stump to celebrate @entity0 's first @entity3 win for seven years mob rule : the @entity49 go into a huddle to celebrate their victory as @entity9 ( right ) slopes off we 've cracked it ! the @entity0 players congratulate each other on a job well done after the final wicket @entity73 roars : @entity74 makes a point to the camera and best pals @entity77 and @entity80 hug @entity81 : the fast bowler ( centre ) wears a massive smile after dismissing @entity85 @entity86 off : the @entity4 spinner ( centre ) swings his bat in frustration after losing his wicket to @entity73 ( right ) beaten : @entity91 looks dejected after surrendering the @entity3 , as the board next to him makes clear vanquished : @entity91 leads his defeated team on to the @entity94 after the close of play @entity97 played : @entity77 shakes hands with @entity91 after @entity0 's @entity3 victory is confirmed @entity0 are flying : @entity100 dives full length to catch @entity85 and edge his side closer to victory he 's a goner : @entity14 ( right ) knows he 's out after a brilliant ton as @entity55 ( centre ) celebrates @entity73 king : the @entity0 spinner celebrates the wicket of @entity14 yet for the morning session at least that dream was kept alive by a performance of the highest class from a genuine all - rounder who also proved himself @entity4 ’s fastest bowler in this otherwise hugely disappointing match			1
@entity14 showed up the inadequacies of senior players who have consistently under - performed in @entity0 by taking on @entity7 and company without offering the kind of reckless strokes that have done for his colleagues			1
while there was @entity14 , born in @entity127 to a rugby league professional who made his life with his family in @entity132 , there was hope for @entity4 as he batted calmly but with authority in company with @entity136			0
and as @entity4 ’s quest to make 504 was whittled down to a target of fewer than 200 @entity49 became ever so slightly twitchy , a sure sign the tourists have missed a huge opportunity here by failing to put them under pressure			0
it is no exaggeration to say that prior , for one , is playing for his future after a dismal summer and now winter but he played well until yet another brainstorm and yet another bad shot to gift @entity7 his wicket			0
@entity14 was undeterred and moved to a century that could provide the launching pad for a long @entity4 career before lunch , celebrating with commendable moderation because of the seriousness of his team 's plight			0
@entity4 went to the interval having added 81 in the first session for the loss of just prior , leaving them 172 still to get with four wickets left , but the break allowed @entity0 to regroup and they returned once again the dominant side			2
@entity14 had played @entity74 with considerable aplomb but when he under - edged a sweep to give the impressive @entity55 another catch the writing was on the wall			0
he left to huge applause from a disappointing @entity94 crowd consisting of more @entity4 fans than @entity49			0
@entity177 : @entity14 ( left ) salutes his maiden test century , made in exceptionally difficult circumstances in your face : @entity14 ( right ) punches the air right in front of @entity7 pleased as punch : @entity14 ( right ) celebrates his deserved hundred round of applause : @entity14 's hundred is clapped by his team - mates on the balcony great strokes from @entity14 : our wagon wheel shows that @entity4 's @entity193 liked playing through the ' v ' crowd scene : the @entity4 fans salutes @entity14 's century and urge on the team eight centuries have been scored in this @entity3 series - and seven of them have been by @entity49			1
@entity4 soon reverted to their woeful type when @entity86 gave it away and then when @entity85 punched @entity7 to a diving @entity100 at mid-off @entity0 were on the brink of their first ashes win since 2006			1
@entity209 was complete for @entity0 , by a margin of 150 runs , when @entity9 was caught at short leg , appropriately , off @entity7 , who has been the single biggest difference between these teams			1
what a contrast from the last series here three years ago when he was little more than a figure of fun to the @entity220			0
@entity0 were ecstatic and who could blame them			0
the extent of their superiority here has been both emphatic and surprising and they are worthy winners of a prize that has eluded them for seven years			0
so @entity14 may have provided @entity4 with a crumb of comfort but this has been an abject series for them and they must now embark on a period of considerable soul - searching before the @entity235 in @entity236			2
edge of reason : @entity136 wafts his bat at a @entity7 delivery and is caught behind @entity241 and despair : @entity7 ( left ) celebrates dismissing prior as the @entity4 batsman walks off running the show : @entity7 has a burst of speed after getting prior and is pursued by @entity61 ( left ) , @entity247 ( second right ) and @entity249 ( right ) turf luck : @entity7 was fortunate to avoid injury after he caught his knee in the grass on the outfield at a stretch : @entity14 dives for his ground to avoid being run out on 91 diving @entity257 : @entity61 is at full stretch to stop the ball going for runs the urn has gone , spectacularly and dramatically , after three @entity26 of their attempt to win their fourth successive @entity3 series and the planning must start now for the next series in @entity4 which comes round the summer after next			1
before that they must attempt to avoid the fate of @entity271 ’s side here seven years ago who were whitewashed 5 - 0 by an aggressive @entity0 hell - bent on revenge for their narrow defeat in the famous series of 2005			1
that was a truly great @entity49 side whereas this one is not so @entity4 have no shortage of motivation in the final two tests of this series to avoid what would be an even greater humiliation			2
thanks to a cricketer who has more than a bit of @entity271 about him in @entity14 , they at least have one young player they can include in what is now destined to be a painful rebuilding programme			0
partners : @entity14 ( right ) and @entity293 encourage each other with a fist bump during the morning session evasive action : prior ducks under a bouncer from @entity7 and ( right ) avoids another short ball on the front foot : prior drives as he tries to be positive despite @entity4 battling for a draw focused : @entity14 watches the ball all the way after playing one through the leg - side not what it seams : this delivery from @entity311 to @entity14 hit a crack and moved miles off the pitch here we go : @entity14 ( left ) and @entity293 walk on to the field to try to save the game for @entity4 inspection : @entity320 puts his hand down one of the cracks , while prior practises his stance mind the gap : a ball is pictured in a crack on the pitch before the start of play on day five			1
