women are far more likely to buy a set of lingerie online if it 's modeled on a brunette over a blonde , or on a plus - size model rather than an ' in - betweenie ' - according to new market research			1
adore me , a fast - growing online lingerie retailer , has built its business around painstakingly testing which models , themes and poses lead to more sales , and the results are somewhat surprising			1
according to its findings , published by @entity17 , photos featuring boudoir props get fewer clicks , as do ' open - mouthed ' models , but when a model touches her hair rather than puts her hand on her hip , sales can double			1
who makes you want to buy ? adore me , a fast - growing online lingerie retailer , has built its business around painstakingly testing which models sell its products better , and found brunettes did much better than blondes adore me uses a marketing ploy called a / b testing , which involves shooting every set of underwear in a variety of ways - on two different models for example - and randomly serving half its online audience with one photo and half with the other			1
whichever picture invites more clicks and leads to more sales is then used going forward , and each month , underwear that has n't sold well will be re-shot using different models , poses or themes			2

bra wars : adore me uses a / b testing , which involves shooting every set of underwear in a variety of ways ( pictured ) , and randomly serving half its online audience with one photo and half with the other subtle tweaks : poses which involve models touching their hair lead to higher sales than when they place their hands on their hips			1
pictured ( left ) the site 's most popular model , @entity81 notably , adore me 's most popular and thus most lucrative model is @entity84 beauty @entity81 , 27 , who has golden brown hair , blue eyes , washboard abs , an ample bosom and puffy lips			1
' no - one ' with blonde hair has so far sold well , the research shows			2
for its plus - size collection , a / b testing has revealed that using genuinely plus - sized models - @entity100 size 12 and up by definition - works much better than using ' in - betweenies ' , who are in between teeny sample - sized and plus - sized			1
and the ethnicity of its models bears little influence on buying patterns			0
consumer - driven : the brand also posts side - by - side shots to its @entity110 account and asks its followers to state their preferences ( pictured ) ' we had some super strong sellers on the @entity117 model , and we had some super bad sellers on the @entity117 model , it was all about the way she behaves in the picture , ' says adore me 's founder , @entity123			2

lingerie retailer adore me shoots every product in two ways and tests which photo sells more of it online
it claims ' no ' blonde models have ever sold well
plus - sized models are more popular than ' in - betweenies ' - who are not *super-skinny* but are still under a @entity100 size 12
sales can double if a model touches her hair instead of puts her hand on her hips
