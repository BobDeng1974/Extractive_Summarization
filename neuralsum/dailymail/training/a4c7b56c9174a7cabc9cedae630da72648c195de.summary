the name @entity1 could return to @entity2 if ambitious plans to revive the iconic brand come to fruition			1

an advert for the ' crowdfunding ' campaign to build a world endurance championship team ' looking at the normal racing model was not exciting or sustainable enough for me to rebuild the team from scratch			1
' for me to bring @entity1 back we have to do things differently			0
