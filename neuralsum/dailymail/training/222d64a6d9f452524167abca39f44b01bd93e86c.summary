by @entity0 one of the unintended consequences of the legalization of marijuana in a growing number of states has been a rise in pot - related poisonings involving pets			2
@entity9 has reported a 30 per cent jump in the number of calls reporting dogs and cats suffering from marijuana poisoning between 2009 and 2013			1
according to veterinary experts , the vast majority of the incidents are accidental ; dogs tend to rummage through trash and , being indiscriminate eaters , they scarf down anything they come across			1
according to veterinarians , dogs and cats react very differently to the effects of cannabis compared to their human counterparts			2
if pets consume a small amount of pot , for example in the form of marijuana butter , they become listless or depressed			2
when ingesting higher doses , our four - legged friends - who lack a liver enzyme needed to break down @entity53 - can lose coordination , become incontinent , turn hyperactive and experience body tremors			1
' they stagger around dribbling urine everywhere , ' said dr @entity58 , of the @entity9			0
munchies : dogs being indiscriminate eaters , they wolf down anything they come across , including marijuana - laced products that can leave them listless , and in some cases land them in a coma other symptoms of marijuana poisoning in dogs include high blood pressure , a drop in heart rate and body temperature , seizures , and in some of the more serious cases , even coma and death			1
that is what happened to @entity87 veterinarian @entity85 's @entity84 terrier , who effectively overdosed on cannabis - infused butter he had found in the trash , @entity80 reported in december			0
the pooch spent three days in a coma , but eventually recovered after being treated with iv fluids			2
pot brownies can be especially harmful to fido because they combine marijuana - infused butter boasting high levels of @entity53 - the main ingredient in cannabis - with chocolate , which is a known heart and nervous system stimulant in dogs			1
a study by @entity105 and @entity106 cited by @entity107 found that cases of marijuana poisoning in pets has increased fourfold at two @entity32 hospitals between 2005 and 2010 - a time span that coincided with a rise in the number of registered medical marijuana users			0
the study looked at 125 cases involving stoned pets at @entity119 in @entity120 and @entity121			0
only two incidents included in the report resulted in fatalities : a dog and a horse died after eating marijuana - infused baked goods and choking on their own vomit			0
the @entity130 , which accepts calls from around the country and @entity133 , has seen a 200 per cent increase in poisoning cases in the past five years			0
experts say dogs can get high from ingesting bong water ( left ) , but it is baked goods like pot brownies ( right ) that pose the greatest risks because they combine @entity53 with chocolate , which is inherently harmful to pets a 2002 study by the @entity146 's @entity9 found that 96 per cent of accidental marijuana poisonings occurred in dogs , with 3 per cent in cats and the remaining 1 per cent in other animals			1
if a dog has ingested marijuana , veterinarians say one of the ways to treat the sickened pet would be to induce vomiting , or feed it activated charcoal to absorb the @entity53 in the pooch 's system			1
in some cases , iv fluids may be required to get rid of the toxins			0
veterinarians urge pet owners to avoid leaving marijuana - laced edibles , such as cookies and brownies , unattended .			0
