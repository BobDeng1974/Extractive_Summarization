[ @entity0 and @entity1 ] published : 16:56 est , 21 july 2013 updated : 03:08 est , 22 july 2013 how long does it take to fall in love ? research has revealed that a quarter of men admit to falling in love at first sight , but only 20 per cent of women			1
here , writers @entity9 and @entity10 , who have been married for 35 years and have three children , recall how long it took for @entity15 ’s arrow to hit the spot			1
happily married : @entity9 and @entity10 have been together for more than 35 years and have three children @entity17 : love struck in ten minutes there was this girl at a party , the younger sister of my college pal @entity22			1
she was wearing a crimson - and - blue , floor - length dress in some sort of gossamer material , and you could see quite a bit of her through it			2
her body was all angles , as if the erotic painter @entity32 had assembled her out of @entity33			2
it was her shoulder blades that got me , though			2
that ’s how it ’s meant to happen , is n’t it ? no words exchanged , no ritual dance to check out someone ’s social ' suitability '			2
you see someone you really fancy and just get stuck in			2
it used to be called love at first sight			1
well , it happened to me — in less than ten minutes			2
i ’d always been a sucker for this kind of thing , going all gooey about a girl i ’d seen on the @entity56 or even in a magazine			2
the trouble was , in that hormonal - emotional @entity59 between late adolescence and college graduation , i ’d been ' in love ' plenty of times , but all to no effect			1
while other young adult chums were cosily pairing off , i was mooning round impossible objects of desire			2
subconsciously perhaps , i enjoyed it so much i set the bar of impossibility higher and higher			2
at one stage , i found myself ' in love ' with the bob - haired silent - film actress @entity76 , born half - a - century before me			1
then i became convinced the only female who really understood my anguish was my tortoiseshell cat , @entity81			2
this was clearly going nowhere			2
it was a family party at the @entity86 home of my college friend ’s parents			2
and there she was , @entity22 ’s kid sister			2
in love : @entity9 and @entity10 soon after they began dating			1
he was already in love			1
she , by contrast , was not all the other girls , half - glimpsed disappearing down escalators on the @entity56 , fell off the edge of the world			1
this time it was different			2
it was a physical reaction that consumed my whole being			2
and i know i ’m not alone			2
many of my male friends have admitted the same thing occurred when they met ' the one '			2
in fact , two of my close friends have gone on to marry @entity10 ’s friends , and they also said they knew immediately			1
it was posh - @entity112 from the @entity113 with a street - cred dash of @entity86			2
‘ this is my fiance , ’ she announced , gesturing to some bloke at her side			2
i ’d done it again : fallen for the girl i could never get ; tilted my hat at the impossible object of desire			0
except this time i put up a fight			0
this girl was real , not a fantasy			0
she had a home phone number , and her brother @entity22 , with whom i ’d shared many drunken conversations on the trials of love , also proved an early ally in the great quest			1
i had my first proper job and @entity10 was conveniently in her final year at university , away from @entity86 , so there were plenty of potential chinks in my love rival ’s armour			1
what a rat i was being			0
but i was in love — and that justified everything			1
i ’d fallen in love in an instant , while she was still shilly - shallying round after three months , and was still engaged ! and so we traversed the landscape of young love behaving like we were something out of @entity155			1
there were visits to art - house cinemas , nights drinking in out - of - the - way pubs ( where none of our friends would see us ) and autumnal , leaf - kicking walks in suitably obscure locations			0
when at parties with mutual friends around , we ’d pretend we hardly knew each other			0
just getting away with it was terrifically @entity169 were rows and sulks			0
serial monogamy was clearly more honourable for @entity10 than sleeping with two men and not telling one of them			1
i just wanted to get on with it			0
love at first sight : @entity178 's @entity177 is immediately smitten by the beautiful @entity179 lightening bolt : @entity182 's character in @entity183 gives up immortality for love but , little by little , i won this guerilla war			1
not just to make @entity10 love me , but to make her confident enough to break off her engagement — which , after six months , she did			1
no wonder women take longer to fall in love — there ’s so much to be sure of			1
why trust a guy who says it ’s you , and you only ? how many others has he said that to ? perhaps i was lucky			0
i fell in love at first sight with someone who seemed like yet another impossible object of desire			1
eventually , she loved me back — and still does			0
her : it takes at least six months a tall , handsome boy i ’d only met for the first time earlier that day was looking down at me and smiling			1
' can i get you a glass of champagne ? ' he said			0
@entity9 , my older brother @entity208 from university , had been paying way too much attention to me all evening , and this had not gone unnoticed by my boyfriend of two years , who had recently become my fiance			1
i was flattered , but also extremely flustered			0
in the whole time we ’d been dating i had n’t looked at another man			0
i ’d never met @entity9 before but he was intelligent , charming , attractive and very funny			1
we chatted for an hour , i drank far too much , and i realised the next morning i ’d agreed to meet him the following weekend			0
he loved the thought i might start dating his friend			0
my parents liked @entity9 , too , but my close friends were appalled			1
for them , my boyfriend and i had almost become part of the furniture			0
so i did n’t tell them ( or my boyfriend , obviously ) when i went to a party with @entity9 the following weekend			1
looking back , i feel ashamed of my behaviour			0
my parents had always told me never to do anything i would n’t like someone else to do to me			0
i never intended to hurt my fiance , but was worried how i could find someone else so attractive while i was supposed to be in love with him			1
i thought it was better to find out now rather than after we were married			1
i enjoyed that party a lot			0
i liked @entity9 a lot			1
he was chaotic ( he still is ) but great fun			0
although i did n’t do anything more than kiss him goodbye at the end of the night , i felt terribly guilty			0
so i decided not to see him again			0
i convinced myself it was just a passing crush			0
over the next two months , however , i began to think about him more and more			1
i tried to listen to my friends who reminded me that @entity9 had never been out with anyone for more than a few months , so why should i be any different ? i knew there was an element of truth to their words : even at 21 , i realised men fall in love so much more easily than women			1
i was in my final year at university , while @entity9 was working for a magazine publishing company in @entity86			1
i still saw him occasionally at weekends , when he came to see @entity266			0
often i ’d find myself chatting over breakfast with him and catch myself feeling jealous if i thought he ’d been out with another girl the night before			0
and still he made me laugh			0
so when he suggested going for a walk together , i agreed			0
then i found myself agreeing to see a film			0
before long , i was seeing him regularly			0
i knew it was wrong , but i convinced myself that as long as we were n’t sleeping together it did n’t technically count as being unfaithful			0
as the weeks went on , and after much agonising , i decided to break off my engagement			0
how could i marry when i had feelings for another man ? finishing with my fiance was one of the hardest things i ’ve ever done , and even though i was now free to start seeing @entity9 , i was too upset to do so			1
i spent evenings weeping during my university finals , feeling wretched and unsure			0
in the meantime , both @entity9 and my ex were bombarding me with phone calls			1
my father ’s observation that : ' well , you do n’t have to marry either of them , ' was no great help			0
eventually , i agreed to meet @entity9 again , and this time i had no doubts			1
i remember the day i knew i was in love			1
he took me to lunch to meet his sister and brother - in - law , where he sat down and played blues piano to his six - year - old niece			0
that was it for me			0
he was already wonderful company : now i could see he was warm and compassionate , too			0
so , yes , it probably took me six months to fall in love with @entity9 , not just one meeting			1
people may assume it ’s us women who fall in love instantly , but for me it was a slow burn , and i needed time to deliberate			1
yet once i was certain , i never doubted it			0
six months later , @entity9 asked me to meet him at the @entity318 bar , and he proposed			1
‘ nothing would make me happier , ’ i answered			0
@entity10 and @entity322 ’s latest book , @entity323 , will be published by @entity324 this autumn .			1

writers @entity9 and @entity10 have been married for 35 years
although he fell in love instantly , she took another six months
