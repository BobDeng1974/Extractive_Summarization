@entity0 is talking about fighting @entity1 or @entity2 , @entity3 or @entity4 — in no given order — before a @entity7 blockbuster with @entity8 sometime next year			1
nothing wrong with ambition but the first question @entity0 has to answer comes in his home town of @entity13 tonight			1
it has less to do with his undeniable boxing ability than with whether he truly is recovered from the machete attack which inflicted horrific wounds to his left leg			1
@entity0 poses on the scales at the weigh in ahead of his match with title challenger @entity24 @entity0 will defend his @entity27 welterweight title against @entity24 in his home city of @entity13 on saturday night @entity0 assures us that all is well following that bizarre incident in @entity32 where he was celebrating the stunning win over @entity35 @entity34 which gained him the @entity27 world welterweight title			1
@entity37 , his @entity38 promoter , tells of how demonically @entity0 has laboured in the intervening six months to rescue his career from near death and the fear of never walking again			2
but what no - one can know until he climbs into the ring as a world champion for the first time is whether there is any residual damage			2
for a boxer there is more to getting better than for most of us			0
it is with the legs that a prizefighter exercises his thrusting mobility			0
it is from the legs that he generates the majority of his punching power			0
@entity0 is set to compete less than six months after a horrific stab attack nearly left him dead in @entity32 @entity24 poses on the scales at the weigh in ahead of his title match with @entity27 welterweight champion @entity0 @entity0 's attack left him with a 12 - inch wound on his thigh and he has shown great strength to recover if either his balance or strength in that leg has been sapped , @entity0 will find it doubly difficult to perform at elite level			1
if both are reduced , he will be diminished			0
thus the examination about to be conducted by his moderate challenger , @entity24 , will be more medical than a test of @entity0 ’s talent			2
with older boxers it is the legs that go first			0
but you never find out for sure until he is engaged in the heat of battle			0
close scrutiny on @entity83 will determine whether @entity0 , at 28 , has been slowed prematurely			2
a small impediment is unlikely to be enough to deprive him of a homecoming victory , even though @entity87 - born , @entity84 - based @entity24 insists he has prepared himself to shut out the roar of @entity0 ’s partisan support			1
@entity0 claimed the @entity27 welterweight title in 2014 when he defeated the previous holder @entity34 ( left ) but the issue is whether he wins in athletic style , with the ‘ five - star performance ’ he is promising his fans			1
the local crowd , those of us at ringside and @entity100 boxing at large will be hoping he can			0
if so , he will travel to @entity102 for may 2 to be ringside for the @entity103 , eager to argue his case for meeting the winner of @entity2 and @entity106 in a world welterweight unification fight			0
that is markedly less likely to happen than an autumn fight with @entity4 , en route to an eventual showdown with @entity8			0
but if @entity0 puts on a show this weekend there would be no harm in asking			2
brook and @entity24 square up with one another ahead of their @entity27 title match in @entity13 on saturday @entity0 has also expressed an interest in facing @entity106 or @entity2 in the near future brook and @entity24 shake hands ahead of their @entity27 welterweight title match in @entity13 on saturday brook v @entity24 is live on @entity121 1 from 7.30pm			1

@entity0 will defend his @entity27 welterweight title against @entity24 less than six months after a horrific machete attack which almost killed him
the 28 - year - old will *headline* in his home city of @entity13 on saturday having worked his way up through the local gyms and *leisure* *centres*
@entity0 says that the stabbing ordeal has *helped* to make him *stronger*
