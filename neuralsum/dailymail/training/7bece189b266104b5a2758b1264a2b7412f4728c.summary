@entity0 director of rugby @entity1 heaped praise on @entity4 after his man - of - the - match display in the 22 - 6 victory over @entity7 at @entity8			1
@entity4 's @entity10 career hit a slump during the autumn internationals when the 22 - year - old was dropped by @entity14 midway through the november schedule , having started in the defeats to @entity17 and @entity18			1
the @entity0 number eight was left out of the match squads for the victories over @entity22 and @entity23 , with his replacement @entity24 subsequently named @entity10 's player of the series			1
no 8 @entity4 hit form for @entity0 on saturday in their 22 - 6 win over @entity7 @entity4 , 22 , attempts to evade @entity7 's @entity29 during his man - of - the - match display @entity4 , however , has bounced back from recent @entity32 disappointments with a string of powerful displays for his club side			1
' he was great today , ' said @entity1 , after saturday 's home win			1
' what 's impressive is you get a huge setback like he got			0
from being the starting no 8 in the @entity40 to not even going into the ( @entity10 ) camp for the last couple of weeks ( of the autumn internationals )			2
it 's a hell of a blow for a young fella			0
@entity0 director of rugby @entity1 paid tribute to the way @entity4 has handled his @entity10 setback ' you can only judge him by how he 's reacted and how he 's responded			1
that 's five games in a row when he 's been there or thereabouts in terms of getting close to man of the match			2
' he was really good out there today			0
it 's good for us and it 's good for him that he 's back in top form			0
' @entity7 boss @entity65 shared @entity1 's view after watching @entity68 punch holes in his @entity70 defence throughout the contest in north @entity72			1
' @entity4 is absolutely world class and he 's a handful , ' @entity65 said			2
' i thought we made a fair effort to contain him today but he 's very , very dynamic			0
he got in behind us a couple of times and caused us a lot of trouble			0
' @entity10 fly - half @entity83 enjoyed more valuable game time in the convincing win over the @entity70 after @entity88 danced his way over in the right corner for his second try of the afternoon , it looked like @entity0 would go on to claim the two tries they needed for a bonus point			1
but @entity65 's men then held firm as @entity1 's men failed to cross the @entity7 whitewash again in the final quarter			1
' it was difficult in the first half , ' @entity1 said			2
' it was wet and we were playing into a fairly strong wind and i thought we did a pretty good job in the first half			0
@entity0 winger @entity88 crosses for one of his two tries for the afternoon ' with 20 minutes to go , we got ourselves into a pretty strong position where we should try to kick on and probably get a few more tries and we did n't manage that			0
' we lacked a bit of composure in their 22			0
we were down there often enough but we were n't good enough to get another few tries and that 's been an issue for us			0

@entity4 was man of the match in @entity0 win over @entity7
