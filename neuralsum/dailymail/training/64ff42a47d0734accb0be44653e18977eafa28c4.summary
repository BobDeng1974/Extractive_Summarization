@entity0 hopes there are plenty more goals to come after smashing four past @entity3 to become @entity7 's record @entity5 scorer			1
the @entity9 striker scored all @entity7 's goals as they overpowered 10 - man @entity3 4 - 1 in an enthralling clash at the @entity13 on saturday			1
@entity0 's haul took him to 61 in the competition , three past compatriot @entity17 's mark of 58 for the club , to 85 in 132 @entity7 appearances overall			1
@entity0 struck four goals for @entity7 against @entity3 on saturday @entity0 reeled away in celebartion after putting @entity7 back in front against @entity3 @entity0 sent goalkeeper @entity22 the wrong way when converting his first penalty of the afternoon @entity0 's four - goal haul against @entity3 makes him @entity7 's all - time top @entity5 scorer			1
@entity0 - 61 goals ( 95 games ) @entity17 - 58 goals ( 113 games ) @entity31 - 48 goals ( 115 games ) @entity34 - 42 goals ( 141 games ) @entity37 - 37 goals ( 89 games ) it was a devastating reminder of his talents now that the fitness concerns that have hampered him throughout 2014 finally seem behind him			1
' i am very happy to be part of the history of this club and i hope i can continue scoring goals , ' said @entity0 , whose @entity7 strikes include the memorable injury - time effort that clinched the title in 2012			1
' but the most important thing is @entity7 can win games with my goals			2
' i was very happy with my performance but the most important thing is we got the three points			0
' @entity0 's performance could hardly have come as a surprise to his countryman @entity60 , the @entity3 manager			1
prior to the game @entity60 had equated @entity0 's play to the musical genius of @entity64 , and his subsequent display reignited debate over where the forward ranks among the world 's elite			1
comparisons with @entity71 and @entity72 were commonplace a year ago before a sequence of muscle injuries ravaged the second part of his 2013 - 14 campaign and his @entity77			0
@entity0 opened the scoring against @entity3 with a precise finish after 13 minutes and then restored the lead from the spot seven minutes later after @entity82 hit a quickfire equaliser			1
he then had another penalty saved by @entity22 but he completed his hat - trick with a third spot - kick after another @entity87 , @entity88 , had been sent off for pulling him back			0
it also came soon after @entity7 goalkeeper @entity90 had remarkably kept out a @entity92 penalty at the other end			1
another crisp @entity0 strike completed the scoring 15 minutes from time			2
@entity3 boss @entity60 was full of praise for his fellow countryman before saturday 's game @entity0 with a signed match ball after the game @entity100 hit the post late on and in the final analysis @entity7 , and particularly @entity0 , could have scored several more , such was the threat they posed			1
but @entity3 were also dangerous and before @entity0 's 68th - minute third goal the contest was very open			1
@entity90 came to the champions ' rescue on a number of occasions			2
@entity90 said : ' it was an exciting game - two exciting teams and luckily we got the better in the attacking stakes			2
' they played well , they attacked well , they are quite similar to us in their style of play			0
' but @entity120 ( @entity0 ) was amazing with the goals he scored and could have got more			2
' @entity3 forward @entity122 felt the final outcome did not do the visitors ' efforts justice			2
like @entity7 , @entity60 's side were more comfortable in attack than defence and had they taken more chances the result could have been very different			2
@entity122 himself was twice denied by brilliant saves from @entity90 in the first half			0
the 23 - year - old , who also had a hand in his side 's goal , told @entity138 : ' the lads are devastated because we came here to win the game and i think we had a good chance			0
' the penalty miss was massive and then obviously the sending - off killed our momentum			0
it was a 4 - 1 scoreline but i do n't think the game reflected that			0
' i think we created quite a few chances			0
the gaffer wanted us to press high up the pitch and when we got it right we countered , and our first goal came from that			0
' @entity3 's @entity122 , pictured tackling @entity157 , was happy with his performance against @entity7 on a personal level , @entity122 was pleased with his own performance			1
@entity122 , who has had loan spells with @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity166 club @entity165 , has been given a chance by @entity60 and seems determined to take it			0
he said : ' on a positive note i felt i did all right , but we have lost the game , so it is a bit bitter - sweet			0
i am a bit gutted about that			0
' but we have got a massive game thursday and we have got a game at the @entity178 next week against @entity179 and hopefully we can put things right there			0
' @entity3 host @entity182 side @entity181 in the @entity183 this week while @entity7 head to @entity185 for a @entity187 clash against @entity188 .			1
