@entity0 has been one of @entity2 's finest centre - back 's for many years but he has endured a torrid start to his life in @entity5 at @entity6			1
the @entity7 followed @entity8 and @entity9 out of the @entity11 exit door this summer - with the trio forming the bedrock of the club 's trophy laden defence			1
replacing @entity0 and @entity8 has been a problem for the @entity18 , most evidently in their 5 - 3 @entity20 defeat at @entity21 earlier this month , but it seems a change has not been particularly good for the centre - back duo , either			2
@entity0 ( bottom ) and @entity8 ( top ) formed @entity11 's central defence for many years @entity0 's arrival at @entity6 was expected to help the @entity29 outfit close the gap to serie a champions @entity31 upon signing a three - year contract at @entity6 , @entity0 stated that @entity5 football suited his game well appearances - 300 goals - 28 @entity37 ( 2006 - 07 , 2007 - 08 , 2008 - 09 , 2010 - 11 , 2012 - 13 ) 1x @entity38 - ( 2007 - 8 ) @entity39 ( 2005 - 06 , 2008 - 09 , 2009 - 10 ) 1x @entity40 - ( 2008 ) @entity41 ( 2007 - 08 , 2008 - 09 , 2010 - 11 , 2011 - 12 , 2013 - 14 ) the pair have shipped in a combined total of 18 league goals in the 10 matches they have played since they departed @entity48			1
while @entity8 's struggles at @entity51 have been well documented in @entity52 , it 's perhaps @entity0 's shaky start at @entity6 that is the most surprising			1
at his unveiling at the @entity29 he said : ' i do n't think this is a step backwards in my career , i believe this is a step forward for me			0
' @entity5 football suits my game well and , as i said before , i have joined one of the big @entity63 clubs			0
' the 32 - year - old signed a three - year deal and was expected by many to help the club close last season 's 42 - point gap to serie a champions @entity31			1
@entity0 , however , endured a nightmare debut at @entity72 , conceding a penalty in the first half before being sent off with seconds remaining in the clash for sarcastically applauding the referee			0
the defender served a one - match ban and missed his side 's emphatic 7 - 0 win against @entity82 in the next match			0
@entity0 ( left ) endured a nightmare debut for @entity6 at @entity72 , giving away a penalty in the first half @entity0 's ( second right ) night got worse when he was sent off for sarcastically applauding the referee returning from suspension , @entity0 was immediately recalled to the starting line - up in their 1 - 1 draw at @entity92 by boss @entity93			1
@entity93 's decision backfired three minutes into the clash , when the @entity7 's dawdling saw him dispossessed by @entity97 , who scored past @entity98 from a tight angle to put the hosts ahead			0
the former @entity11 captain looked more like his commanding self in the @entity6 's 2 - 0 win against @entity104 on wednesday , but at home to @entity106 on sunday he was found badly wanting			2
@entity0 ( left ) looks dejected after his error allowed @entity92 to take an early 1 - 0 lead in their match this month @entity0 suffered his first defeat as an @entity6 player where they were thrashed 4 - 1 by the @entity113 - who were bottom of the table until that result			2
even worse , the defender gave away his second penalty in four @entity120 games , this time hauling down @entity122 inside his own box			0
@entity125 ’s effort was saved by @entity126 but @entity6 ’s defence fell apart as @entity129 ’s hat - trick condemned them to defeat			0
@entity0 's career at @entity6 hit a new low on sunday as they were thumped 4 - 1 at home to @entity106 @entity6 boss @entity93 could only watch as @entity0 conceded his second penalty in four @entity120 games @entity0 needed the help of an engineer after he was caught stuck in the lift for two hours on a public holiday @entity140 scoring in the @entity38 against @entity141 appearances - 455 goals - 8 @entity145 titles - ( 2002 - 03 , 2006 - 07 , 2007 - 08 , 2008 - 09 , 2010 - 11 , 2012 - 13 ) 1x @entity38 - ( 2007 - 8 ) @entity146 - ( 2005 - 06 , 2008 - 09 ) 1x @entity40 - ( 2008 ) @entity41 - ( 2003 - 04 , 2007 - 08 , 2008 - 09 , 2011 - 12 , 2013 - 14 ) off the pitch , too , @entity0 's acclimatisation to @entity5 has n't got off to the smoothest of starts after he was caught stuck in a lift for two hours on a public holiday before engineers arrived to free him			1
his poor displays have been mirrored by @entity8 following his free transfer to @entity156			0
in his six matches at the @entity20 new boys , the 35 - year - old has been part of a defence that has conceded 13 goals - with @entity164 's side winning just one of their opening matches so far			1
@entity8 was at fault for @entity51 's opening day 1 - 0 home defeat by @entity170 , allowing @entity172 ' matchwinner @entity173 to score from a corner - an error that was heavily criticised by @entity176 pundit @entity175			2
@entity8 has suffered a nightmare start at @entity51 - conceding 13 goals in six @entity20 games @entity8 is dejected after being at fault during @entity51 's opening day defeat by @entity170 @entity8 was beaten in the air by @entity183 ( both centre ) for @entity186 's opening goal against @entity51 in their 2 - 2 draw against @entity186 earlier this month , the former @entity52 captain endured a torrid afternoon against @entity183			1
vying for the ball in the early stages of the match , @entity183 embarrassingly outpaced @entity8 - an asset that defender was once renowned for			0
@entity183 soon tormented @entity8 once more - beating him in the air to allow team - mate @entity196 to score			0
both @entity8 and @entity0 were wonderful at @entity11 but suddenly , maybe the decision to let them leave @entity48 does not look too bad			1
@entity8 ( second right ) was even outpaced by @entity183 ( far right ) during their @entity20 encounter like our @entity11 facebook page here .			2

@entity0 and @entity8 have both had poor starts to the season
@entity0 joined @entity6 in a three - year deal this summer from @entity11
@entity8 moved to @entity51 after his @entity48 career
@entity212 have conceded 18 league goals in 10 matches since leaving @entity11
@entity0 was sent off on his @entity6 debut against @entity72
32 - year - old has given away two penalties in four @entity120 matches
@entity8 was thoroughly *outplayed* by @entity186 's @entity183 this month
