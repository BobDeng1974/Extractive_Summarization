we were feeling woozy by the time madame @entity1 started pouring her 2004 vintage , but at the end of the dimly lit tasting room , the children were as bright as buttons			2
@entity7 , our four - year - old , proudly announced that he could taste a hint of fresh strawberry			2
@entity11 , aged two , declared that she 'd identified the tang of chocolate			0
my wife @entity14 and i , sniffed and slurped , and tried not to hiccup too loudly when @entity1 asked if ' ze beautiful smooth finish ' of her decade - old claret was ' agreeable '			2
wine tasting , family style : with a few glasses of grape juice , everyone can detect ' notes of chocolate ' it was mid-afternoon at @entity26 , a small winery roughly half an hour 's drive from the city of @entity30 , and we 'd reached the stage in every wine - tasting session when fugginess descends			1
the children had been over-indulging , too			2
but before anyone calls social services , read on : for while we 'd been quaffing fine plonk , they 'd enjoyed nothing more intoxicating than a few glasses of alcohol - free grape juice , and some macaroons			2
these were among the many local delicacies on offer during the @entity26 's ' family gastronomic excursion ' , a guided tour for adults and children , of the local cuisine			1
this corner of south - western @entity53 is gastronomic mecca - but my two free - spirited children 's idea of refinement is baked beans , chips and a good food fight			1
luxurious : the @entity30 decided to start catering for the family market a few years ago transformation : a floor of the palatial , 18th - century building has been largely given over to ' family suites ' treat : children will be thrilled to discover gift bags containing toys , teddy bears , colouring books , stickers , and sweets in their rooms luckily , the @entity30 , a luxurious , 130 - room landmark decided to start catering for the family market a few years ago			1
while it retains all the uniformed flunkies and marble hallways of a five - star establishment , a floor of the palatial , 18th - century building has been largely given over to ' family suites ' , where there is no tut - tutting at inky - fingered young guests or their parents			1
the fun began at check - in , where @entity7 and @entity11 met the hotel 's ' children 's concierge ' , a charming young man who specialises in everything from babysitters and bottle warmers to child - friendly day - trips ( we made use of all three )			1
then they were thrilled to discover gift bags , with their names on , containing toys , teddy bears , colouring books , stickers , and sweets			0
in the bathroom were toddler - sized dressing gowns , and cute slippers			2
an escape zone among the vineyards : the small winery of @entity111 sits just outside @entity30 after a hearty lunch , we set off on a guided walking tour of @entity30			1
@entity7 and @entity11 were thrilled by the fearsome gargoyles that inhabit its limestone buildings			0
the highly prized wine has also made @entity30 one of @entity53 's wealthiest and most glamorous , cities			1
its historic centre , filled with mansions and grand public buildings , sits on the @entity124 , from where local products are shipped across the world			0
once - grimy buildings are now whitewashed so they have the warm , hue of mature brie			0
squares are filled with public art and fairground carousels			0
a new tramway has been laid , parks contain smart adventure playgrounds ( where we spent many happy hours ) , and the streets are filled with boutiques , buskers , bars and wine shops			0
a city of charm and elegance : with @entity147 cathedral at its heart , @entity30 looks great on camera but @entity7 and @entity11 's favourite was the famous @entity151 , a sort of vast civic paddling pool , where they 'd have gladly splashed around all weekend			1
we spent our final afternoon in the rural seclusion of @entity156 - mainly in the tasting room			0
we drank , the children ate			0
we made tasting notes ; they tried to identify the flavour of each snack from picture cards			0
as madame @entity1 put it , @entity53 's food capital had successfully turned two more young philistines into petits gastronomes			1
@entity168 ( 0844 493 0787 , www.ba.com ) flies to @entity30 from £ 75 return			1
the @entity170 ( 0033 5 57 30 44 44 , www.ghbordeaux.com ) has doubles from £ 197 , and family suites from £ 380 a night @entity173			0
@entity174 ( 0033 5 56 30 78 01 , www.chateaubardins.fr ) offers tours , tastings and gastronomic outings .			0

south - western @entity53 's biggest city is a well - known haven for wine *lovers*
but @entity30 can also be a *surprisingly* *inviting* destination for families
the five - star @entity30 has its own ' children 's concierge '
