a report has revealed how desperate migrants are able to ' shop around ' online to find human traffickers willing to take them to @entity3			1
they use social media sites that work like an online travel agent before gangs send them floating across the @entity8 on lethal scrapyard cargo ships they have bought on the internet			1
information gathered from migrants rescued at sea ' confirms that social media platforms such as @entity18 and @entity19 are widely used to share information on how to enter the @entity13 illegally , ' an @entity13 document reveals			1
desperate migrants are able to ' shop around ' online to find human traffickers willing to take them to @entity3			1
pictured are immigrants in @entity22 after being rescued from a crippled smuggling ship in november a baby looks out from the window of a bus after disembarking from a crippled freighter carrying hundreds of refugees trying to migrate to @entity3 , at the coastal @entity22 port of @entity30 , @entity31 details of how migrants are being smuggled in to the continent were compiled by @entity3 security experts in a report seen by @entity37			1
the document underscores the ingenuity and flexibility of human traffickers , as @entity43 's mounting chaos forces them to turn away from the country as the preferred departure point			0
with thousands of @entity47 willing to pay as much as 2,000 euros ( about £ 1,550 ) for a spot in an overcrowded dinghy - and wealthier @entity49 now paying out 9,600 euros ( £ 7,500 ) for a place aboard a rusty cargo ship - criminal gangs from @entity54 are homing in on a share of the profits			2
social media is becoming a versatile tool in the hands of migrants and smugglers			1
many use members - only @entity18 accounts to share information about how to enter the @entity13 illegally and elude authorities once inside			2
last week , smugglers sent the @entity67 - flagged @entity66 at full throttle in rough seas towards the @entity71 coast with hundreds of people locked inside			0
migrants are pictured waiting to disembark from the ship ' would - be migrants exchange information that can vary from routes to be used , asylum - related general information , facilitators ' contacts and also warnings regarding certain facilitators that usually just take advantage of migrants in order to obtain money from them , ' the @entity13 document says			1
one @entity18 page , with several thousand likes , provides contacts via @entity92 and @entity93 to an @entity95 office where secure payments for travel from @entity54 to @entity31 can be made			2
another has regularly updated information on travel document requirements in several countries , including @entity54			2
the @entity102 is also being used for buying cargo ships that carry migrants across the @entity8 , according to @entity13 border agency @entity105			1
it says that more than a thousand migrants were rescued in two incidents in the last few weeks alone			0
@entity105 spokeswoman @entity110 said one of the vessels used last week appears to have been purchased online from a scrapyard			2
a report suggests about 15 cargo ships with would - be asylum seekers aboard have tried to reach @entity3 since august migrants use social media sites that work like an online travel agent before gangs send them floating across the @entity8 on lethal scrapyard cargo ships they have bought on the internet while the smugglers share information online , there is little evidence they work as one gang			1
the nationalities of crews have often been @entity131 or @entity132 , and @entity105 analysts have been unable to establish any pattern that might link the smugglers to any larger criminal enterprise			0
' there is no evidence of these networks being connected			0
this might just be a new business opportunity that someone has picked up in @entity54 , ' @entity140 told @entity37 almost 170,000 people were rescued in the @entity8 last year , but hundreds died and more are missing			0
@entity13 border authorities are struggling against opportunistic tactics , such as migrants scuttling boats and throwing motors overboard once they spot a coast guard ship			1
under international law , that turns the encounter into a search - and - rescue mission obliging the coast guard to haul the vessel to @entity3 shores			2
last week , smugglers sent the @entity67 - flagged @entity66 at full throttle in rough seas towards the @entity71 coast with hundreds of people locked inside			0
they then abandoned ship in high seas			0
a @entity105 vessel from @entity167 eventually managed to tow the @entity66 to @entity71			0
' it 's like from the movies			0
you would never think that ghost ships going on full speed could happen in real life , ' @entity140 said , ' let alone with more than 360 people on board			0
