@entity0 attempted to lure back @entity2 voters yesterday , saying he understood concerns about eastern @entity5 migrants and care workers ‘ who do n’t speak @entity8 ’			1
the @entity10 leader acknowledged immigration ‘ has been changing communities fast ’ and that voters want politicians to ‘ do something about it ’			1
his speech came hours after @entity18 , speaking in an interview , urged him not to give in to ‘ nasty and unpleasant ’ rhetoric from @entity2			1
@entity0 said he understands voters ' fears over immigration - but has ruled out giving voters an in - out @entity26 referendum despite growing pressure from backbenchers in the wake of last week 's @entity5 elections @entity32 's success in the @entity5 and local elections has increased pressure on all three @entity35 party leaders			1
@entity10 's @entity0 today refused to overhaul his party 's immigration policy - or offer voters a say on leaving the @entity26 , despite @entity2 's success at the risk of further alienating disillusioned @entity10 supporters who transferred their vote to the @entity44 party , mr @entity18 called the rise of @entity2 a ‘ regressive and reactionary ’ movement			1
he told @entity48 ’s today programme about the march of @entity44 parties across @entity5 : ‘ we are confronted by what i think are these very reactionary forces			0
we have to confront them , expose them and take them on … these parties have no actual solutions to the problem of the 21st century			0
’ he added : ‘ by all means have rules and controls , but the idea that the problems of @entity64 are about immigrants is a backward and regressive step			0
i think we should contend every inch of that argument			0
’ but yesterday mr @entity0 was at pains to claim that people who worry about immigration are not prejudiced			1
he described former die - hard @entity10 voters who have turned to @entity32 ’s party as ‘ people who work hard to provide for their family , people who love our country , but feel left behind ’			1
@entity18 this morning urged @entity0 to ' stand up , to lead ' by tackling @entity32 on @entity5 and immigration			1
he said the @entity78 had not achieved anything by offering voters an in - out poll by 2017 he told an audience in @entity83 , @entity84 – a seat labour is hoping to win back next year – that many people there had talked to him about ‘ immigration and the changes [ they ] have seen ’ in the area			1
he said : ‘ builders from eastern @entity5 , care workers from overseas who sometimes do n’t speak fluent @entity8			1
@entity96 changes are happening to this community … that are reflected across the country			0
’ @entity0 declined a challenge to describe his leadership in a word , replying : ‘ @entity103 ’			2
he was asked to use one word after accusations from within the @entity10 that he is ‘ too wordy and academic ’			0
but mr @entity0 , who shook his head and tutted after being asked the question , said : ‘ i ’ll give you two – @entity103			2
’ he then used 111 words to explain what he meant by the phrase			0
aides said he was not ‘ unable ’ to define himself in one word , but ‘ chose not to ’			0
the @entity103 slogan was adopted in 2012 as mr @entity0 sought to rebrand his leadership			2
but his image has been attacked in recent weeks			0
one shadow cabinet member told a newspaper : ‘ it ’s not just that people think he is weird			0
they think he ’s a joke , and that ’s even more dangerous			0
’ mr @entity0 said the decline of the docks in the area had left communities without a decent wage and fearful about their children ’s job prospects			2
he added : ‘ over the last decades , there were big changes happening in our country , and fewer and fewer working people thought that anyone in politics was getting those changes , that anyone in politics could do something about it			0
’ although senior @entity10 figures have advised mr @entity0 to do more to address concerns about immigration , he offered no new policies on the issue			1
his current proposal is to better enforce the minimum wage so firms can not undercut local people with cheap labour from abroad , and improve controls at borders			2
instead he stressed @entity64 would be better off in the @entity26 , and that creating secure jobs , building more housing and the cost of living were his priorities for the next election			0
when accused by a @entity10 member , during the question and answer session , of ‘ lurching to the @entity162 ’ , he said : ‘ it ’s not right - wing for us to talk about immigration … we have got … to talk about immigration in a progressive way			2
’ but mr @entity0 insisted voters should not accept @entity2 ’s ‘ easy answers ’ and said mr @entity32 ’s party wanted to blame all the @entity64 ’s problems on ‘ @entity5 and foreigners ’			1
yesterday @entity173 , former leader of @entity83 council – where @entity10 lost overall control in last week ’s elections – said the party had made a ‘ fundamental mistake ’ by not offering an @entity26 referendum			0
but mr @entity18 – whose government opened the doors to eight eastern @entity5 countries in 2004 – urged mr @entity0 against offering one , saying : ‘ i ’d advise him to stay firm			1

labour leader ' understands concern about *non-english* speaking workers '
tells supporters he wo **n't** *introduce* *cap* on immigration that he can not keep
comes after @entity18 urged @entity0 to ' stand up ' to @entity32
but @entity0 says @entity196 did not do enough on immigration
says understands concern over @entity201 builders ' who do **n't** speak @entity8 '
