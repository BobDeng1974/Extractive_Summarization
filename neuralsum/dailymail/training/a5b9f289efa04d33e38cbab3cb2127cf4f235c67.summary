by @entity0 published : 10:33 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 10:40 est , 9 april 2013 a young boy bled to death in hospital over a weekend due to a severe lack of communication between doctors , a coroner has ruled			2
two - year - old @entity8 died from bleeding of the stomach lining which was probably caused by his intolerance to milk			1
he was rushed into @entity14 and despite suffering a previous large internal bleed , was not earmarked for an endoscopy to look at his digestive system until the next day			1
independent expert dr @entity19 , a paediatric surgeon , said the procedure would have found the bleeding and @entity8 could have had an operation that day to remove part of his stomach - a procedure which would have saved him			1
tragic : two - year - old @entity8 bled to death in hospital due to a lack of communication between doctors , a coroner has ruled he told the @entity31 inquest : ' what was a complete failure was the lack of collaboration between surgeons and gastroenterologists			1
closer teamwork would have resulted in a different outcome			2
' @entity8 's distraught mother @entity40 , 38 , broke down and sobbed as she told the hearing : ' i believed they would cure him and make him well			1
' recording a narrative verdict , @entity44 said : ' on the basis of expert opinion , there was a a failure to plan and / or a failure to communicate about a child who was known to be at serious risk			0
' while it remains unclear whether requested communication to the gastroenterologist at the first sign of deterioration would have saved @entity8 's life , it is very clear that it may have done so			1
' however , endoscopy and surgery on the previous day would likely have saved @entity8 's life , but such was a matter of judgment rather than specific failure			1
' @entity8 had endured three endoscopies at the hospital in the previous fortnight after vomiting blood and suffering stomach pain , but was thought well enough to be discharged on friday , july 9 , 2010			1
delay : @entity8 was rushed into @entity14 and , despite suffering a previous large internal bleed , was not earmarked for an endoscopy to look at his digestive system until the next day consultant paediatric gastroenterologist dr @entity74 , who was in overall charge of @entity8 although off - duty that weekend , said he left instructions to be called if the boy had a serious bleed again			1
mrs @entity79 , who also has two daughters aged seven months and seven , left with her son but during the night he vomited blood again			0
' he cried and i felt he was in pain , ' she said			0
' his body was cool and exhausted			0
' @entity8 was rushed by ambulance to @entity87 and several hours later was transferred to the @entity14 unit on the afternoon of saturday , july 10			1
the mother said after doctors checked her son she noticed his nappy was ' full of blood ' which she was worried about and claimed the wet bed covers had to be changed at least five times by nurses			0
' a nurse told me it was a good sign as the blood was coming through his faeces and not the mouth , ' she said			0
mrs @entity79 was then told by staff that dr @entity74 would perform another endoscopy on @entity8 at 8am on the sunday morning			1
an independent expert said an endoscopy would have found the bleeding and @entity8 could have had an operation that day to remove part of his stomach , saving his life but in the middle of the night she noticed his stomach was distended and ' swollen like a bubble '			1
a doctor thought it might simply be a build - up of gas , but at 4am @entity8 vomited blood again			1
by 6.30am ' all the doctors were in panic and confused '			0
she said that when dr @entity74 arrived she was pleased , as ' i believed he was going to save my so '			0
but despite a blood transfusion , @entity8 failed to respond and he died at 9am on the sunday			1
paediatric registrar dr @entity125 , whose job was to stabilise the boy , told the @entity31 inquest she had not been informed of any ' red button plan ' to alert dr @entity74 and a surgical team if there was a further bleed			2
when she first saw @entity8 he was sat up in bed watching @entity136 on a monitor with his mother and appeared stable			2
she was only called by a nurse at 4.30am when he vomited blood again			0
she instructed he be given more fluid as he had low blood pressure and a raised pulse , called for closer monitoring and ordered some units of blood which should have been ready			0
dr @entity125 said she alerted both the surgical and medical registrars to the situation and was told dr @entity74 would be coming in as planned to carry out an endoscopy at 8am			0
@entity8 had already had three endoscopies at @entity14 in the previous fortnight after vomiting blood and suffering stomach pain when coroner @entity155 pointed out that dr @entity74 had asked to be made aware if there was any further bleeding she replied : ' there was no red button plan delivered to me			1
' dr @entity162 , for the family , put it to dr @entity125 : ' knowing that this is a significant bleed , you did n't make any contact with anyone anywhere until 6.15am			2
' she replied : ' i assessed and i managed and then i contacted my superiors			0
' @entity8 's family are now taking civil action for damages against the hospital specialist paediatric registrar dr @entity175 said he arranged for dr @entity74 to do the endoscopy on sunday morning and there was no contingency plan in place			2
he said : ' i do n't recall him saying he had to be called back in the event of further bleeding			2
' he himself was not told of any further fresh bleeding which could have been a ' serious finding '			2
mrs @entity79 and her petrol station cashier husband @entity184 , 42 , ran a grocery store in @entity87 at the time but after the tragedy moved to live with relatives in @entity189 , @entity190			0
they came to the @entity192 12 years ago and are @entity192 nationals			0
dr @entity19 , who reviewed the case , said @entity8 had a ' mighty strange illness ' for a child and he had not come across such a case of catastrophic upper gastrointestinal bleeding in a child before			1
he said the @entity14 was unique in that @entity8 was admitted to the care of paediatricians rather than surgeons			1
the boy should have had an endoscopy on the saturday afternoon which was an ' error of judgment ' by the doctors caring for him			0
after the hearing , @entity8 's uncle @entity209 , speaking for the family said : ' they are very , very sad that this has happened to their baby			2
' they are also upset that the hospital has not apologised or said sorry so far			0
they think no mother should have to go through what she has again			0
' the family are taking civil action for damages against the hospital .			0
