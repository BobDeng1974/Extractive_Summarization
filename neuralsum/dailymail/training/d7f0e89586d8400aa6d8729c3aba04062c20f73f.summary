by @entity1 reporter published : 09:52 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 12:40 est , 10 october 2012 workers at @entity4 's largest dairy operation , which indirectly supplies food giants @entity6 and @entity7 's have been charged with animal cruelty after shocking undercover footage revealed terrible abuse			1
the three former staff members at @entity13 ' @entity12 in @entity14 were seen beating cows with a pink cane as the animals slipped and slid on the wet concrete floor ; kicking , shoving and stomping on cows that have fallen between the metal bars in the milking stalls ; and a cow being dragged out of the barn by a chain around her neck as she lies prone on the concrete floor			2
@entity29 , the owner of the dairy , said that when the @entity4 @entity31 told him about the video and allegations in august , he was ' sick about it			1
' @entity36 's dairy operation is the largest in @entity4 , with 13 facilities and about 60,000 milk cows			1
scroll down for @entity39 ) a worker at @entity13 ' @entity12 in @entity14 kicks out at a cow in restraints @entity44 prosecutor @entity43 said he filed misdemeanor animal cruelty charges against @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 in late august after an investigation that was prompted by the video			2
if convicted , the men face fines of up to $ 5,000 each and jail time on a first offense			2
' we do n't tolerate animal abuse			2
that 's a big issue for us , ' @entity57 said			1
' i love my animals and i 've been in the dairy business since i was a kid			1
animal care is a number one issue in our facilities			0
' @entity57 said officials with the @entity4 @entity31 showed him the footage in august and he fired the five workers seen in the video the next day			1
in the weeks since , he said he 's installed video cameras throughout his facilities and hired an additional supervisor			2
' and we also showed the video to all the rest of the employees in our dairies , all 500 employees , and they had to sign a deal that said they understand that there 's zero tolerance for animal abuse in our dairies , ' he said			2
another staff member at @entity12 kicks out at at suspended cow who was being prepared for milking sad : one staff member punches a cow they are attempting to milk in the face - while another rams a bar down on a cows head a cow is struck with a pink metal bar after the cow refuses to do what he wants we 've been in business 30 years and we 've never had this happen before			0
we 're all devastated here			0
' @entity106 , the executive director of @entity107 , said those steps amount to ' too little too late			0
' he hopes the video will convince @entity6 , @entity111 and the @entity7 's fast food chain 's — companies which @entity106 says uses milk from @entity115 — to stop using milk from the @entity4 company and send a ' clear message to the industry that animal abuse will not be tolerated			1
' ' we believe this abuse is ongoing and was allowed to flourish , unchecked , until @entity123 sent a hidden camera in , ' @entity106 said			0
' there are no meaningful watchdogs inside a factory farm			0
... across the country this is actually our fourth dairy industry investigation that we 've done and every single one of those investigations has led to animal cruelty charges being filed			2
' the same pink metal bar is used as a rod to beat a cow which is unable to move a man stands on the head of a cow at @entity140 - while another cow cries out in distress a cow that refused to move is towed by a tractor - part of a series of abuses that caused three staff members to be charged with misdemeanors the organization wants @entity6 to require suppliers to establish policies on the care and treatment of cattle , including prohibiting animals from being dragged without a sled , prohibiting dairies from docking the tails of cattle or removing their horns after a certain age , and requiring that the provide clean , dry housing areas and nonslip flooring in milking barns			1
@entity165 , a spokeswoman for @entity6 , said the company is continuing to voluntarily work with its dairy suppliers to make sure they meet or exceed animal care guidelines			1
' @entity6 has cared about the well - being of animals for years			1
we have high standards for our suppliers already in place , ' @entity165 said			0
the video was upsetting , and @entity6 does n't condone the abusive behaviors , she said			1
' we think it 's extremely serious , ' she said , adding , ' we 're glad to see the immediate action taken by those involved			2
' @entity165 also stressed that @entity6 does n't raise dairy cows and does n't have a direct relationship with @entity36 dairies			1
she said the company planned to make its standards and communications with suppliers more transparent for consumers , and will post them on its website			0
@entity43 , the prosecutor , said @entity13 has cooperated fully with law enforcement and investigators do n't believe any of the dairy 's upper management knew about the mistreatment			1
in a shocking piece of evidence of abuse - a man stands and jumps on the back of one of the dairy cows at @entity12 in @entity14 @entity13 ' @entity12 in @entity14 , @entity4 ' there 's no indication at all that the owners of the dairy were in any way complicit in this behavior			1
in fact , they have been extremely cooperative with the investigation , ' @entity43 said			0
' they were very supportive of the charges being filed and as far as i can tell , it 's an isolated incident			2
' @entity111 admitted that while a @entity107 investigation indicates that @entity216 may be part of their supply chain , they are conducting their own investigation			0
@entity4 dairy farm which supplies @entity6 and @entity7 's fires staff after ' sickening ' video shows them stomping , dragging and beating cows inside milking barn ' we take this matter very seriously , ' said a spokesman for the fast food firm			1
' @entity111 does not tolerate or condone cruelty to animals			0
as a part of our animal welfare commitment , we require that all suppliers and their vendors adhere to our vendor code of ethics			0
' @entity111 has launched an immediate investigation into this serious allegation and will take swift action if there is evidence of systemic violations to our animal welfare policies or vendor code of ethics			0
' a spokesman for @entity7 said that while @entity13 ’ @entity140 in @entity4 is not a direct supplier of @entity7 ’s , they do sell milk to a cheese processing company , who then sells on to one of the fast - food chain 's direct suppliers			1
' we have instructed @entity7 ’s supplier to disassociate with @entity216 immediately , ' said the @entity7 's spokesman			1
' @entity7 maintains stringent animal welfare standards with our suppliers			1
' @entity258 , spokeswoman for the @entity4 @entity31 , said the agency launched an investigation immediately after @entity107 officials showed the department the video and other documentation			0
' obviously our first concern is the well - being of the animals , ' @entity258 said			0
' the images do not meet acceptable animal care or husbandry standards			0
so we did a preliminary investigation and then turned the matter over to local law enforcement			0
' the agency has n't ever received any other animal welfare complaints involving @entity36 dairies , she said .			0
