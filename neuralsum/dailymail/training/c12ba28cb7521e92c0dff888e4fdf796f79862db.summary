parents and civil rights activists are furious at the new program that will allow school administrators to monitor the heart rates , exercise , and sleep schedules of students using electronic bracelets			2
a school district in @entity10 , @entity11 , announced that it would be the latest addition to the list of schools using the technology to help track students ' activity and fight obesity			1
unanswered questions - including which students will wear the devices , for how long , and the purpose of the gathered data - have parents concerned about the level to which the program will invade their children 's privacy			2
working it out : @entity10 students are going to be the latest to wear electronic monitoring watches to help track their physical activity throughout the day ten @entity35 monitoring bracelets were ordered by the @entity37 athletic department and will be used throughout the district in the coming semester			1
when students wear the watch - like monitors , their heart beats and motion patterns are uploaded onto hand held computers by teachers			2
that data is then stored into a collection displayed on a password - protected site			0
parents and teachers should have access to the site , though it is unknown how or if the identity of the chosen students will be revealed			0
the system has been used in school districts in @entity58 and @entity59 already , where parents and civil rights advocates were among the most vocal critics			1
' when you get into monitoring people ’s biological vital signs , that ’s a pretty intrusive measurement , ' said @entity68 spokesman @entity67			1
the root of the riot : the @entity72 monitors track heart rate and sleep time ' a program like this should only be voluntary			0
nobody should be forced to reveal biological indicator , ' mr @entity67 told the @entity79			2
@entity80 is known how the ten monitors - each of which cost $ 90 - will be spread throughout the seven schools in the @entity85 , or whether students will volunteer or be chosen to participate			0
one parent whose child wore the device in his @entity91 elementary school said that she never gave consent and was not privy to the results , both of which she found problematic			0
' i did n't even know it was going on , and i 'm active in the school			0
we have gotten no information about the website security or where the data will go , ' @entity99 told @entity104			0
when they were used in the @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity59 , some parents were concerned that the data collected by having third , fourth and fifth graders wearing the monitors was not just being used during the school day but also during private family time			1
' i feel they 're getting into privacy issues , into people 's personal lives , when they have to be worn at home , ' said parent and the parent - teacher organization president @entity119			2
' that kind of makes me a little leery , and though i think the monitors are a fantastic idea in school , i do n't want that at home , ' ms @entity119 continued			0
trying it out : the @entity85 includes seven different schools , and so far it is n't known how the 10 monitors will be divided by displaying the childrens ' heart rates and showing how little or much they are active throughout the day , proponents argue that it promotes an interest and awareness of their own efforts			0
' @entity136 play a crucial part in how physical educators can not only assess in their classes , but how we educate students about how their bodies react to everything they do , ' said @entity144 , a @entity72 representative			0
' having data that drives how we create our curriculums is critical to helping students learn how to take care of themselves , ' he continued while talking about the @entity58 program			1
@entity11 is ranked the 16 worst state in the country in terms of childhood obesity , with 17.1 per cent of children considered officially obese in july			1
by comparison , the two other states who have used the monitors - @entity59 and @entity58 - are both better off as they are ranked 31st and 21st respectively			1
healthier habits : @entity11 is ranked the 16 worst state in the country in terms of childhood obesity , with 17.1 per cent of children considered obese			1
