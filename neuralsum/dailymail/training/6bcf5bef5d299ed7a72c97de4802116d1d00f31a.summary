by @entity0 published : 11:08 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 12:27 est , 24 may 2013 criticism : councillor @entity2 has come under fire for saying travellers should ' learn to live like everyone else ' a councillor in charge of allocating traveller sites is facing calls to resign after a rant against gypsies in which he said they ' screw everything up ' and should ' learn to live like everyone else '			1
cllr @entity2 , the @entity15 cabinet member for community safety on @entity17 in @entity18 , has been suspended from his new role for his comments , just days after being appointed			1
@entity21 , a former mayor of @entity22 , said he was ' against freeloaders ' and that travellers ' c * * * * ed all over the place ' turning wherever they brought their caravans into a ' building site '			1
in his first interview since being posted to the job - which puts him in charge of allocating new traveller sites - he told the @entity33 : ' they move on and turn it into a building site			2
' they c * * * all over the place , they p * * * over the field , they throw rubbish all over the place			0
' he added : ' are they just people who sit in a caravan and plant themselves wherever they see fit without paying council tax and without cleaning up after themselves ? should one develop a nice strategy for that ? no. ' they live on the fringe of that			1
they take everything they can get and give very little back so i take a pretty hard line			0
' why do n't they learn to live like everybody else does ? why do they take everything , screw it up and move on ? if they wanted to be part of society and take their place in society by paying their way , cleaning up after themselves and allowing themselves to be subject to community laws			1
' @entity21 added that he would be in favour of allocating travellers an appropriate brownfield site , if he could be assured they would take ' a positive attitude '			2
' but as far as i know successes in this area are very very few and far between , ' he added			2
he continued to say that travellers are unlikely to integrate into the community because they are continually moving from place to place			2
dispute : travellers have occupied a site in @entity86 , @entity18 , for more than 25 years the @entity15 also recalled how he had a tonne of coal stolen 26 years ago and followed the tyre tracks back to a traveller site , but no prosecution was brought			1
workers at the @entity94 have called on @entity21 to resign , saying he has ' no idea ' about gypsy culture			2
chairman of the @entity98 said this week : ' @entity21 should hang his head in political shame , using us for political gain			0
he has a responsibility to every member of society , not a select few			0
' we feel that @entity21 has not one inkling of what the gypsy and traveller community culture is all about			0
' for over 500 years , we have had bigots like @entity21 making sweeping statements that could be taken in a right - wing racist way , inciting racial hatred toward the gypsy and traveller community			0
' we are now seeking @entity21 stands down from his political career for his racist rant			1
we are seeking a prosecution			0
' cllr @entity121 said councillor @entity2 has been suspended from his council role in the wake of the comments pending a review			1
in statement , the @entity127 said : ' in light of the comments printed in the @entity131 , @entity21 has been suspended from his position as @entity133 and @entity134 pending a review of the issues covered within the article			1
' @entity21 â€™s comments were not acceptable and he now appreciates that this is the case			0
' we do not support the comments @entity21 said in the interview he gave shortly after being appointed to the portfolio			0
' we at @entity17 are very proud of its record of working closely with all our communities across @entity22 and we are determined that the excellent relationships we have built up over the years will continue			0
