by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 15:21 est , 25 november 2013 @entity3 : 07:20 est , 26 november 2013 during a token policy appearance monday in @entity6 , president @entity4 railed against @entity7 for standing in the way of his ' comprehensive ' immigration reform plans that would extend an amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants			1
' we 've got to finish the job , ' @entity4 said , referring to bipartisan legislation that passed the @entity15 in june but has long stalled in the @entity16			1
' it is long past time to reform an immigration system that does n't serve @entity1 as well as it should , ' he told a crowd estimated at 600			0
' we could be doing so much more to unleash @entity1 's potential			0
' protesters interrupted him at one point , shouting ' stop deportations ! ' and begging him to use an executive order to fix the nation 's immigration failings			1
' you have the power , ' one yelled			0
' actually , i do n't , ' @entity4 replied			0
' if , in fact , i could solve all these problems without passing laws in @entity35 , then i would do so , ' he insisted			0
' but we are a nation of laws			0
' as business leaders – including @entity42 ceo @entity41 – have begun to issue public demands for looser immigration policies , both parties are feeling pressure			1
an anti-deportation protester ( r ) in the audience shouted down the president until @entity4 insisted that he 's powerless to act without @entity35 @entity4 tried to pressure the @entity49 by insisting that business leaders , including many who did n't vote for him , favor a new immigration plan @entity42 co-founder and ceo @entity41 , seen with his @entity56 - @entity1 wife @entity55 , is arguing for looser immigration policies in what some say is a power grab to free up cheaper labor in the @entity1 @entity61 ' the only thing standing in our way right now , ' @entity4 said , ' is the unwillingness of certain @entity7 in congress to catch up with the rest of the country			1
on sunday , @entity41 said on the @entity69 ' that immigration reform is one of the ' biggest civil rights issues of our time ' and said it 's ' really heartbreaking ' to see children of illegal immigrants shut out of employment opportunities through no fault of their own			1
but skeptics believe big business is engaged in a naked political ploy for a cheaper source of domestic labor			2
' @entity1 is not an oligarchy , ' @entity7 @entity85 senator @entity84 complained on monday			1
' congressional leaders must forcefully reject the notion , evidently accepted by the president , that a small cadre of @entity91 can tailor the nation ’s entire immigration policy to suit their narrow interests			1
' @entity4 spoke at the @entity95 in @entity6 , where he is scheduled to appear at two @entity97 fundraisers before flying to @entity98 for more cash - collection events @entity4 , @entity84 noted , ' is preparing to hold a fundraiser with @entity102 executives , a group clamoring for more guest workers at a time when nearly half of recent college grads are underemployed			2
' @entity4 , however , said immigration reform is ' the smart thing to do ' economically , claiming it ' would boost our economy and shrink our deficits			0
' some in the @entity49 , most notably @entity15 moderates , have made their peace with proposals that would give legal residency to people who live in the @entity1 illegally and put many on a path to citizenship			2
but @entity16 hard - liners have embraced an over-our - dead - bodies approach , holding out for tougher enforcement and tighter border security as a condition of any new law			1
@entity4 is on a @entity127 fundraising swing , appearing at seven separate events to collect cash for @entity97			0
but in order to justify the government expense involved with travel for the better part of a week , the @entity16 scheduled one policy speech at the @entity95 and another at @entity135 , the film studio , in @entity98			2
the @entity136 estimates that it costs $ 176,000 per hour to operate @entity137 , the president 's private aircraft			0
speaking to reporters on board the plane on monday , deputy white house press secretary @entity140 claimed that ' there is strong bipartisan support on @entity146 for common - sense immigration reform			0
' citizen engagement : @entity4 turned to talk with the agitator while the audience of 600 waited immigration activists like thee in @entity152 have taken protests directly to @entity155 's offices , insisting that the government should stop departing illegal immigrants surprise ! @entity4 is the undisputed king of illegal - immigrant deportations , but is now calling for a new national policy monday 's heavily stage - managed event managed to let some protesters through , despite the @entity16 's best efforts to control the president 's image ' the only thing that ’s blocking that right now is not one party , it ’s one faction of one party			1
' he complained of ' significant consequences for our economy ' if an immigration reform bill does not reach the president 's desk			2
@entity4 faces discontent from immigration activists who demand an immediate halt to deportations , which have reached all - time high numbers since his first inauguration			2
in 2011 alone , the @entity4 administration sent 392,000 illegal immigrants back to their home countries , according to statistics from the @entity187			1
@entity49 sen. @entity84 complained that an ' oligarchy ' of business titans is trying to manipulate immigration policy to serve their own narrow interests but sen. sessions , the most senior @entity7 on the @entity193 , warned monday that @entity4 has a ' dismal record on immigration			1
' ' during his time in office , the president has systematically dismantled interior enforcement , handcuffing immigration officers and bypassing @entity35			2
... no agreement should be entered into while such lawlessness continues			0
' @entity41 , the @entity42 founder , raised hackles among border guards inside the @entity155 agency when he weighed on immigration in this month			1
@entity207 , president of the @entity208 , criticized him on monday for supporting the immigration bill that passed in the @entity15 earlier this year			2
' why did you support a bill , @entity212 , which legalizes aliens with extensive criminal records , including sex offenders , gang members and other violent and dangerous criminal aliens ? ' he asked			1
' until mr. @entity41 meets with officers and learns the truth about our immigration system , i would respectfully suggest he suspend his lobbying activities			0
' @entity16 majority whip @entity224 said sunday on the @entity225 ' face the @entity227 ' program that the @entity49 will ultimately back some sort of reform , but with conditions attached that the @entity15 may not like			2
@entity207 , president of the @entity208 , criticized @entity42 ceo @entity41 for supporting @entity15 legislation that ' legalizes aliens with extensive criminal records , including sex offenders , gang members and other violent and dangerous criminal aliens ' @entity4 is in @entity235 to attend fundraisers , and squeezed a single policy speech into his itinerary to justify the government 's travel expenses on the political trip ' immigration reform is going to happen , ' @entity224 said , ' but it ’s going to happen in a step - by - step method			1
... we have a broken process – the immigration system , it is broken			0
it needs to be fixed			0
' bone of contention : the @entity250 marks the @entity251 with @entity252 , @entity253 on the left ( south ) side and @entity256 , @entity257 on the right ( north )			0
thousands of illegal immigrants cross the border here every week those steps include new border security measures , including spending billions to wall off @entity1 's southern border with @entity253			1
also on the @entity49 's wish list is a system of enforcement that will stop the annual release of thousands of criminal aliens from immigration detention facilities			1
@entity4 has seemingly endorsed these measures , but wo n't agree to implement them in advance of establishing ' an earned path to citizenship ' – what some in the @entity49 see as an amnesty for as many as 11 million lawbreakers			0
@entity16 @entity7 lack a political incentive to act any time soon , since only a handful have enough @entity281 constituents to pose a re-election risk in 2014			1
a poll released monday by the nonpartisan @entity284 found that most @entity1 – including a majority of @entity7 – support a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants			1
but barely one - third of @entity7 say there 's enough urgency in the problem to suggest that it should be addressed in the coming few years			0
@entity4 also lacks the long coat - tails that marked his first term in office			0
his is a damaged brand , reeling from the failures of @entity296 and leaking political capital in the wake of a nuclear deal with @entity300 that has polarized @entity146			0
but he insisted monday that ' everybody wins if we get this done			0
' ' it 's up to @entity7 in the @entity16 to decide if we can move forward ... if they do n't want to see it happen , they 've got to explain why			2

business leaders including @entity42 's ceo are demanding looser immigration policies but skeptics say they *'re* only after cheaper labor
@entity4 *shoehorned* an immigration speech in between 7 fundraisers
@entity15 @entity7 say @entity91 want an ' oligarchy ' that twists immigration policy for their own economic advantage
protesters heckled the president during his speech , demanding an executive order to stop deportations
the @entity4 administration has sent more illegal immigrants packing than any other in @entity1 *history*
one group of @entity155 officers *slammed* an existing @entity15 bill , saying it ' legalizes aliens with extensive criminal records '
the ball is in @entity16 @entity7 ' court , but hard - liners are insisting on tighter border security and tougher enforcement before the law can *change*
