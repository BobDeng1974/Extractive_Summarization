@entity1 may be attempting to restart its main nuclear bomb fuel reactor after a five - month shutdown , experts believe			1
newly released satellite images suggest the country could be in the early stages of bringing its @entity8 reactor complex back into use			1
when fully operational , the five - megawatt facility is capable of producing about six kilos of plutonium a year - enough for a nuclear bomb			1
the @entity20 - @entity24 at @entity25 said the latest satellite images showed fresh activity at @entity8 prompting suggestions of ' the early stages of an effort to restart the reactor '			1
signs included steam coming from a probable pressure relief valve on a steam pipe just before it enters the turbine building , and meltwater running off the centre of the turbine - building roof , the institute said in a post on its 38 @entity43 website			1
the analysis stressed that the activity was too ' limited ' to enable an accurate assessment of when the reactor might be tested and become operational			0
the think - tank said there were clear differences between the latest 2014 - 1015 imagery and that from more than a year earlier when the reactor was known to have been operating			0
@entity1 shut down the @entity8 reactor in 2007 under an aid - for - disarmament accord , but began renovating it after its last nuclear test in 2013			2
the country 's leader @entity56 is pictured earlier this month when fully operational , the five - megawatt facility is capable of producing about six kilos ( 13 pounds ) of plutonium a year - enough for one nuclear bomb imagery from december 2013 showed snow had melted off the roofs of all the buildings related to the reactor and foam could be seen at the end of the turbine building 's steam and wastewater drainpipe			1
it said the absence of the foam in recent images could be related to the installation of new piping			0
@entity1 announced in april 2013 that it would revive the aged five - megawatt research reactor at the @entity8 nuclear complex , saying it was seeking a deterrent capacity , a move condemned by members states of the @entity21 nuclear watchdog , the @entity83			2
@entity1 shut down the @entity8 reactor in 2007 under an aid - for - disarmament accord , but began renovating it after its last nuclear test in 2013			0
the @entity21 's nuclear watchdog , the @entity83 , said in september last year that steam discharges suggested the reactor might already be operational again			0
but analysis of later satellite imagery led other experts to conclude it had either failed to restart properly or had been shut down again - possibly for refuelling or renovation			0
unused fuel rods are pictured in 2009 stacked in a warehouse at @entity1 's nuclear complex in @entity8 pictures have also detected activity at a separate @entity8 facility , thought to be used for enriching uranium			2
the @entity43 says the purpose is to produce low - enriched uranium for a new reactor it is constructing , but experts suspect that the real goal is weapons - grade uranium , an alternative to plutonium for a nuclear bomb			1
earlier this month , @entity1 offered to suspend nuclear tests in exchange for a temporary freeze on @entity20 - @entity114 joint military exercises			0
@entity115 rejected the offer , which it described as an ' implicit threat ' to detonate a fourth nuclear device			0
a separate analysis on the 38 @entity43 website two weeks ago said satellite images of the @entity43 's @entity123 nuclear test site showed there were no signs that a detonation could be imminent .			2
