by @entity0 published : 12:05 est , 30 october 2012 updated : 12:05 est , 30 october 2012 @entity1 than we thought ? a new study suggests that @entity4 may have learned how to make certain tools and jewellery from humans neanderthals learned how to make jewellery and sophisticated tools from the ancestors of modern humans , a study published today suggests			1
new high precision radiocarbon dating shows that a cultural exchange may have taken place between modern humans and @entity4 in @entity18 and @entity19 more than 40,000 years ago			1
the findings have important implications for our understanding of our long - extinct sister species			2
if @entity4 made the ornaments , they must have been capable of symbolic behaviour thought to be unique to man			2
artefacts discovered strewn among the remains of @entity4 in the @entity32 cave in central @entity18 and several other locations have long presented anthropologists with a puzzle			2
belonging to what archaeologists term the @entity41 culture , a transitional industry from south - west @entity18 and northern @entity19 , it has been hotly debated whether they were made by @entity4 or humans			1
the artefacts bear all the hallmarks of production by humans , but their discovery among @entity48 remains has suggested that they were the work of our rugged evolutionary cousins			1
previous research had suggested that the artefacts were in fact produced by human ancestors before settling into deeper layers of cave strata until they sat among the earlier remains of @entity4			2
but now the findings of an international team from the @entity62 , @entity63 , suggest that the tools and body ornaments were indeed produced by @entity4 - but only after humans arrived in the area			1
the so - called ' transitional industries ' like the @entity41 culture are a key for understanding the replacement process of @entity4 by modern humans in western @entity71 at the beginning of the @entity73 between 50,000 and 40,000 years ago			1
ancient : châtelperronian @entity48 body ornaments from the @entity32 cave the @entity62 team , led by @entity78 , selected 40 well - preserved bone samples from the @entity32 , primarily from those areas that contained @entity41 body ornaments or neanderthal remains but also from older and younger layers			0
in addition , a @entity48 tibia bone from @entity85 was analysed			0
the researchers extracted collagen from the samples and dated the bones by taking isotopic measurements			0
using an accelerator mass spectrometer the researchers obtained very high precision 14c dates			0
' in @entity96 , scientists use the most advanced techniques for high precision radiocarbon ( @entity99 ) dating of bones , ' said dr @entity78			0
at the @entity32 , the large series of dates obtained prove that no major layer admixture occurred in the site			0
more ornaments from @entity32 : a new study suggests they may have been made by @entity4 the @entity41 phase is dated to between 44,500 and 41,000 years ago and the @entity48 skeleton of @entity85 from the end of this time period ca			0
this , the researchers say , confirms that @entity48 populations are directly responsible for the production of @entity41 assemblages in central @entity18 , including the body ornaments of @entity118			0
' these ages are significant for another reason as well , namely because modern humans replaced the last known @entity122 @entity4 starting around 50,000 years ago and were already present in @entity18 and in @entity63 when @entity4 produced the @entity123 ( @entity41 ) , ' said dr @entity78			1
' given the dating results , we believe that @entity4 made sophisticated bone tools and body ornaments only after modern humans introduced these new behaviours in @entity130			1
most likely , some level of cultural diffusion occurred from one group to the other more than 40,000 years ago			0

findings could *revolutionise* how we see our extinct evolutionary cousins
cultural exchange between humans and @entity4 may have occurred
