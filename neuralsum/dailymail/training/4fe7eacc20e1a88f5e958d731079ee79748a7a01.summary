by @entity0 published : 09:36 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 10:06 est , 6 august 2013 @entity1 , 37 , outside @entity2 today , where his claims he was not well enough to do community service were rebuffed a man who makes £ 50,000 a year on the streets told a court his ill health would not permit him to do community service today as he was spared jail for repeatedly breaching an asbo			1
@entity1 , 37 , a ' workshy ' serial beggar who lives in a £ 300,000 council flat in @entity12 , south west @entity13 , told magistrates that his epilepsy and asthma meant he could n't do the community work he was ordered to do instead of a jail term			1
but the court today ordered him to carry out 40 hours of community work , as magistrate @entity21 said : ' begging is a form of working - it strikes us that mr @entity1 should try to do something more constructive '			1
@entity1 , who claims he begs because his benefits are not sufficient , was spotted pleading for cash in @entity13 's @entity28 just weeks after magistrates ordered him to stop operating in the capital			1
he was arrested and bailed , only to start begging again in nearby @entity31			0
sentencing @entity1 to a 12 - month community and supervision order and 40 hours ' unpaid work today , chairwoman of the bench @entity37 told @entity1 he was lucky to escape prison			1
she said : ' you have got an @entity10 : you know what that is , yet you seem to disregard it			0
that is going to remain in place			0
' we are going to treat you fairly leniently today but if you keep breaching it can be a custodial sentence and that would be a shame , if only because of your dog			0
' what would happen to it if you were in custody ? ' we are sentencing you to a community order for 12 months with supervision for 12 months ; we hope you get something out of this in terms of your addiction of begging			0
' we are also giving you 40 hours ' unpaid work			1
we hope that you enter into the spirit of that			0
' @entity1 banged on the the dock at @entity2 and shouted out , interrupting the hearing to say he is too sick to do unpaid work because he suffers from asthma and epilepsy			1
a @entity69 at @entity2 dismissed @entity1 's health fears , saying ' we are not asking the impossible			1
' the magistrate told @entity1 , seen above , going to prison ' would be a shame , if only because of your dog ' but magistrates said there was nothing stopping him carrying out the work unless he was ' work - shy '			1
mrs @entity21 said : ' begging is a form of working , he can be outside during daylight hours and he can stand and sit and talk to people			0
' we are not asking the impossible			0
rather than working as a beggar it strikes us that mr @entity1 should try to do something more constructive			2
' @entity1 has regularly been seen in ragged clothes sitting on the pavement of @entity91 in @entity13 , with a handwritten sign claiming he was ' homeless and hungry '			1
but in fact he was pocketing as much as £ 300 a day and returning home each night to his @entity12 flat			2
in may magistrates handed him an asbo which banned him from begging anywhere in @entity13 for two years and from having a dog unmuzzled			0
@entity1 lived in this modern flat while spending each day begging with a sign reading ' homeless and hungry ' but the serial beggar was spotted by @entity104 street wardens asking for money in @entity28 on 9 july			1
just a week later he flouted the order again , and was seen begging and with an unmuzzled dog in @entity108 , central @entity13			0
at the may hearing , magistrates were told @entity1 regularly went into betting shops and amusement arcades to change his coins for notes which totted up as much as £ 300 a day			2
but despite receiving state hand - outs and living in a taxpayer - funded housing association flat , he pleaded poverty and said he begged for cash because he could n't afford to live on his benefits			0
' he suffers from asthma and epilepsy and he says that is going to be an issue with unpaid work			2
' - @entity1 's lawyer @entity125 @entity125 , defending , told the court : ' mr @entity1 is begging because the benefits he relies on do n't work out for him to live on			1
' he is receiving state benefits and after paying for food and bills he is left with £ 35 a fortnight ; ultimately this is the reason he begs			0
' he suffers from asthma and epilepsy and he says that is going to be an issue with unpaid work			2
he says that if you hand him that you will be setting him up to fail			0
' but mrs @entity21 rebuffed this claim and said : ' having asthma and epilepsy does n't stop you from doing that work '			2
at a previous hearing the 37 year - old was handed a conditional discharge for two breaches of his asbo after he was seen begging in the borough of @entity148 and @entity12 on 4 june and on @entity149 in west @entity13 on 12 june			1
but the sentence has been found to be improper and he was resentenced to another 12 - month community order with supervision to run concurrently			0
@entity1 had pleaded guilty to all four charges of breaching an asbo and did not reply when asked if he would stop begging for good as he left court today .			2

@entity1 , 37 , given 40 hours ' community service instead of prison
his lawyer tells court he has asthma and epilepsy so ca n't do the work
@entity69 dismissed @entity1 's health fear , saying : ' we *'re* not asking the impossible '
