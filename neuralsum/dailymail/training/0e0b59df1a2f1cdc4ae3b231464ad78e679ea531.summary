@entity0 and @entity1 are being dropped by 40 radio stations in the ongoing wake of the @entity5 controversy			1
the pair , whose radio shows are the first and second most popular in the @entity7 , are being taken off air by @entity12 which is the second - biggest broadcaster in the nation			1
the decision means that @entity0 and @entity1 will lose a significant chunk of their listeners - and could make @entity20 ’s @entity19 the most listened to radio show			1
however , @entity0 is already making moves to get back on the radio in cities where he would be blacked out			2
the move is being hailed as a ‘ major shakeup for the radio industry ’ and even though it is reportedly over money , there is speculation that @entity0 may be the real reason			1
the root of the row does seem to be @entity0 ’s comments about @entity5 , who in february last year gave evidence before the @entity54 on the need for affordable birth control			0
on his radio show @entity0 said in response that she ‘ essentially says that she must be paid to have sex - what does that make her ? ' he went on : ‘ it makes her a slut , right ? it makes her a prostitute			2
she wants to be paid to have sex			0
she 's having so much sex she ca n't afford the contraception			0
she wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex			0
’ his comments sparked and firestorm on social media and an advertising boycott from the likes of @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and the @entity83			0
controversy : @entity5 became a national celebrity when @entity0 called her named after she was denied an appearance before a @entity54 hearing about birth control @entity12 chief executive @entity89 is said to have blamed him for the $ 2.4m first quarter slump in advertising revenue after he called @entity5 , the pro-choice @entity92 law student , a ‘ slut ’ and a ‘ prostitute ’ live on air last spring			2
according to @entity96 , @entity12 has now said it will not renew either @entity0 or @entity1 ’s contract , which expire at the end of the year			1
negotiations are also said to have broken down between @entity12 and @entity100 , the division of @entity41 which distributes the shows for both men , because they could not agree on payments for distribution rights			2
both sides are reportedly tough negotiators and have apparently chosen to walk away rather than agree an unsatisfactory deal			0
@entity12 has already begun working on how it will fill the slots vacated by @entity0 and @entity1 and are looking at moving hosts like former @entity112 presidential candidate @entity111 and conservative commentator @entity113 into one of their slots			1
executives have also begun asking radio talent agencies and regional stations to put forward potential hosts			0
@entity121 , a left - wing commentator with @entity122 , said : ‘ the boycotters did it			0
‘ they got @entity12 to dump not only @entity0 , but also @entity1			1
@entity20 's @entity19 could become the top radio show in the country if the two conservative talk shows are dropped from @entity129 ‘ without the public pressure , bad publicity , and shame that the boycott brought on to his advertisers , @entity0 and @entity12 would probably still have a happy marriage			1
’ @entity0 and @entity1 ’s shows are the first and second most popular in the @entity7 with 14 million and 13.25 million listeners each week respectively			1
being dropped by @entity12 does not mean they will be going off air completely as @entity41 , the largest radio distributor in the @entity7 , will continue to carry them			2
but a surprising effect could be making publicly - funded @entity20 's @entity19 the no.1 show in the country			1
it is currently in third with 12.3 million listeners , followed by @entity148 , also on @entity20 , with 11.8 million listeners			0
in a statement @entity12 said : ‘ @entity12 is not in a position to comment about negotiations with talent under contract , no matter what the rumor of the day might be ’ .			0

@entity12 , the nation 's second - largest owner of radio stations , is set to drop @entity0 and @entity1
the move would block access to the top two most popular radio shows - both conservative talk shows - to millions of listeners across the country
@entity20 's @entity19 could take the no. 1 slot
