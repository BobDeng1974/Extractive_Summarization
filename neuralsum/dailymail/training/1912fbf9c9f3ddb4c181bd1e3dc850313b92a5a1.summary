when the occasion demands , @entity0 is still eminently capable of getting in an opponent ’s face or delivering a sharp rebuke to a team - mate			1
yet , as the @entity8 captain approaches his 30th birthday , there is a growing contemplative side to his character			1
this maturity has manifested itself not only in a more considered playing style for club and country but also his prodigious bid to become a coach			2
@entity0 recently penned a new contract with @entity8 and has no intention of hanging up his boots any time soon			1
but , just as he has had to reform his game from the high - energy approach that brought him praise and notoriety as a kid at @entity26 , he realises he needs to look for a vocation to sustain his attention when he is no longer capable of performing at the top level			1
@entity0 has shown a growing maturity as the @entity8 captain approaches his 30th birthday @entity0 is currently with his @entity8 team - mates on a training break in @entity33 the prospect of @entity0 the manager may be a long way off but he has been taking a hands - on role with @entity40 ’s under - 20 squad at @entity41 and has even been spotted in the dugout during a handful of @entity45 fixtures			1
he is enjoying the responsibility , even if it does n’t seem so long ago that he first bounced into @entity48 ’s @entity26 team and started ruffling feathers			2
‘ i look at how i was then and how i am now , ’ reflects @entity0 during a break at @entity8 ’s training camp in @entity33			1
‘ at 17 , i would look at guys like @entity54 who was 34 and say : “ jeez , he ’s got two years left in him — i ’ll never be like that ! ’			2
‘ now , i ’m coming to 30 and i ’m starting to think more about what i ’m going to do after i stop playing			2
‘ it ’s not just about training then going home and chilling out			2
i look at the whole picture differently			0
i appreciate things a lot more now			0
’ as part of a talented group that included his friends @entity65 and @entity67 , @entity0 ’s introduction to first - team football was aided by a gang mentality			1
@entity71 , then @entity72 , tended to deploy him on the front foot to exploit his running power but , over the years , his role has changed and he is now effectively a screening midfielder			2
where once @entity0 ’s distribution could be erratic , he is now a crisp and careful passer of the ball and one whose job is to shape play rather than shake it up			1
‘ i started off as a striker , so i ’m getting further back , ’ he laughs			0
‘ i had a freedom at @entity26 — i was young and i would run into anything , tackle anyone , but now i understand the game a lot better			2
‘ it ’s about getting on the ball and playing rather than putting pressure on people			0
it ’s a totally different style of play			0
‘ i ’ve enjoyed playing centre - midfield for @entity8 more than anything			1
i enjoy getting on the ball , taking it off defenders and starting things more than i ever did chasing down the goalie or chasing left - backs around the pitch			1
’ @entity0 is all smiles as he relaxes by the pool during some time downtime @entity0 feeling the heat during a session at their training base in @entity33 while @entity0 has been cutting his coaching teeth with @entity8 ’s development squad , those same players are having their education enhanced by the odd training session with the first team			1
several , including @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 flew out to @entity118 with the first - team squad last tuesday and their presence has raised the tempo on the practice field			1
‘ people always say that it ’s hard for the younger ones coming into training but it ’s actually harder for the older pros to keep up with them , ’ admitted @entity0			1
‘ they are keen , they are willing to go and they bring so much energy that it brings out the best in the older players			0
i still play to win and these kids do , too			0
‘ hopefully , they will learn something from me and , if they do , that ’s amazing			0
but i ’m only 29 and there ’s a new manager who has come to @entity8 with new ideas			1
’ while team - mate @entity142 ’ dithering over a contract extension suggests a reluctance to commit to the @entity146 era , @entity0 ’s new deal can be taken as a sign that he is on board with the @entity149			1
@entity146 favours a game - plan which sees the team press the opposition high up the pitch and , while his younger self might have revelled in the chance to close down defences , @entity0 ’s current role has taken some adjustment			1
‘ everyone has different ideas , ’ he adds			0
‘ the way we play with @entity8 is totally different to what we do with @entity164 , yet it ’s the same formation			1
‘ so i have @entity165 on one hand and @entity146 on the other , and i have to adjust my game when i go to play for @entity164			2
it ’s good to have that ability to adjust			0
’ it was @entity165 who paid £ 4.4million to take @entity0 to @entity8 but , asked to nominate the most important managerial influence on his career , @entity0 chooses neither he nor one of the other obvious candidates such as @entity72 or @entity175			1
‘ of them all , @entity48 ( @entity48 ) has got to be the one , ’ he states			0
‘ he gave me my chance to go and play , to come through and show what i could do			0
‘ you will always remember your first manager more than any of the others			0
he is the one who put that trust in me at the start			0
‘ @entity185 came @entity72 and we played brilliantly under him at @entity26			0
@entity165 showed his faith in me by buying me for @entity8 and later it was the exact same under @entity175			1
i was his captain and i ’m now playing under @entity146			2
you take bits and bobs from them all			0
’ @entity189 is closed down on the ball by team - mate @entity191 ( right ) 29 - year - old @entity0 forced off during a friendly against @entity193 in @entity33 @entity146 has fully endorsed @entity0 ’s foray into coaching and it is expected that , in time , he will assume some duties with the first team			1
for now , the arrangement is informal but @entity0 is enjoying the opportunity to offer advice to a new generation			1
‘ @entity40 has been great			0
he lets me come in when i like , even if it ’s just to have a wee chat with the lads , ’ he says			0
‘ he is very positive about what i ’m doing and the kids have been brilliant , too			0
i ’ve been with them for four games and they ’ve won four times , so it has been going well			0
‘ the coaching has helped me understand the game more			1
i ’ve always looked at the game from a midfielder ’s point of view and i ’ve tended to look forward			2
working with @entity40 , i ’m learning to look back			0
‘ i ’m understanding how to close the park down and show players onto a different side — all the things you hear every manager talking about			2
‘ starting my b licence let me see that it ’s not all about chucking cones out or wee , short games in training			0
it is about how you manage players — respecting the older pros and how you treat the younger ones			0

@entity0 still eminently capable of getting in an opponent *'s* face
yet there is a growing contemplative side to him as he approaches 30
@entity8 captain looking towards a *future* as a coach in the game
he has been taking a hands - on coaching role with under - 20 squad
