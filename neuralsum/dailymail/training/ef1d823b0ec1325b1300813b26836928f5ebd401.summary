by @entity0 for @entity1 during @entity3 , the @entity2 wanted to boost sailors ' night vision so they could spot infrared signal lights			1
according to some reports , they fed volunteers supplements made from the livers of walleyed pikes , and over several months , the volunteers ’ vision began seeing the infrared region			1
while this legendary tale may sound far - fetched , a crowd - funded group of scientists has recreated this experiment and claims to have had successful results			0
after several weeks , volunteers using an electroretinogram ( @entity23 ) noticed spikes in their vision to 950 nanometres ( nm )			1
@entity26 falls between about 800nm to 2500nm on the electromagnetic spectrum infrared vision helps animals such as snakes see the heat signature of their prey , but without night goggles , humans do n’t have this ability			1
the latest experiment was designed by @entity38 , a @entity39 - based group whose vision is to explore ‘ non-institutional open source science			2
’ they claim that by limiting @entity45 in the diet and replacing it with @entity47 , the human body increase its production of something called porphyropsin			1
this is the protein complex that grants near infrared ( @entity26 ) vision to freshwater fish - and so , they say , can give humans completely natural infrared vision			1
@entity45 is commonly found in green and yellow - pigmented vegetables including bell peppers and carrots			0
@entity63 , on the other hand , is derived from fish livers			1
infrared vision helps animals such as snakes see the heat signature of their prey , but without night googles , humans do n’t have this ability			2
the latest experiment was designed by @entity38 , a @entity39 - based group whose vision is to explore ‘ non-institutional open source science ’ they claim that by limiting @entity45 in the diet and replacing it with @entity47 , the body increase its production of something called porphyropsin , which can provide infrared vision like that used by the @entity81 ( pictured ) the project raised its target $ 4,000 ( £ 2,400 ) in october on the scientific crowd - funding site experiment			1
after several weeks , four volunteers using an electroretinogram ( @entity23 ) noticed spikes in their vision to 950 nanometres ( nm )			1
it is is not known how the volunteers took their high levels of @entity63			2
@entity26 falls between about 800nm to 2500nm on the electromagnetic spectrum , meaning they could pick up some heat signatures			1
however , there has been some scepticism about the results			0
retinal neuroscientist @entity97 wrote in @entity98 that no matter what we eat , photoreceptors in our eyes simply can not pick up any wavelengths of light beyond 650nm			2
‘ these limits in human photoreceptors are based upon molecular structures of photopigments , ’ he said			0
‘ these photopigments can be “ tuned ” within a narrow window within the red / blue / green spectrum , but getting them to be sensitive to infrared wavelengths is impossible within the limits of physics or biophysics			2
’ researchers have unveiled plans for a contact lens that could give its wearer infrared ' night vision ' researchers have unveiled plans for a smart contact lens that could give its wearer infrared ' night vision '			2
the team say that by sandwiching graphene inside the lens they can build a sensor capable of capturing every from visible light to infrared			0
they have already built a prototype smaller than a fingernail , and experts say it could one day be built into lenses for soldiers and others who need to see in the dark			0
@entity137 at the @entity138 say their layered approach can lead to ultrathin sensors			0
' we can make the entire design super-thin , ' said professor @entity137 , assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering it can be stacked on a contact lens or integrated with a cell phone			0
' the prototype device created by professor @entity137 is already ' smaller than a pinky nail ' and can be easily scaled down			0
' if we integrate it with a contact lens or other wearable electronics , it expands your vision , ' professor @entity137 said			0
' it provides you another way of interacting with your environment			0

science for the @entity160 raised $ 4,000 ( £ 2,400 ) from *public* to fund study
they replaced @entity165 in the diet and replacing it with @entity63
the supplement causes body to increase its production of porphyropsin
this is the protein complex that grants near infrared ( @entity26 ) vision to fish
after several weeks , volunteers saw spikes in vision to 950 nanometres
@entity26 falls between about 800nm to 2500nm on the electromagnetic spectrum , meaning the volunteers could pick up some heat signatures
