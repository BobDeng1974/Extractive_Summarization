@entity11 ’s disease is a long - term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system			1
inflammation can affect any part of the digestive system , from the mouth to the back passage , but most commonly occurs in the last section of the small intestine ( ileum ) or the large intestine ( colon )			1
symptoms include diarrhoea , abdominal pain , fatigue and weight loss and , in the long term , the inflammation can result in additional complications , such as narrowing of the colon			2
it is n’t fully understood what causes it but genes , a faulty immune system and previous infection may play a role			2
there is no cure but there are medications to help control symptoms			0
in up to 75 per cent of cases , surgery will be needed to repair damaged parts of the digestive system.here are currently at least 115,000 people living with @entity11 ’s disease in the @entity152			1
@entity11 's disease can affect people of all ages , including children			1
