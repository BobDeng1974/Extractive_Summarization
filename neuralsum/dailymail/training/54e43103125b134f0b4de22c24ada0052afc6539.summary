the founder of an app that lets @entity3 users send the virtual currency privately has admitted he expects people will use it to buy drugs			1
however , @entity8 added he wanted to give people ‘ freedom ’ to break the law if they wanted to , by using an untraceable system of payment			1
he continued that he wanted @entity14 - a simple plug - in that sits discreetly on users ’ internet browsers - to be ‘ crisis - forcing ’ and change the way we spend money , even if that means on narcotics			1
miners are in charge of maintaining the blockchain			0
as their computers perform the calculations to do that , the process rewards them with newly minted bitcoins encrypted and difficult - to - trace pieces of code that function like cash - called @entity3 - can be exchanged over the internet			1
but current @entity3 wallets , in a world where there are no bank accounts and are used to virtually store the coins and make transactions , can be complex			2
@entity14 is designed to be simpler and encourage people who are not tech savvy to store and use the virtual currency			1
the app and plug - in will protect a @entity3 user 's anonymity and money			1
it is hoped @entity14 , which will work on @entity54 and @entity55 browsers , will accelerate the currency 's rate of adoption around the world			2
it will be open source and free when it launches , which is expected to be early this year			0
@entity14 will supposedly return @entity3 to its ‘ anarchist ’ roots after it became targeted by law enforcement in the @entity65 for its alleged ties to criminality			1
it will be an app and plug - in for the @entity55 and @entity54 browsers and will allow users to store , send and receive @entity3 , only with extra security			1
@entity14 is expected to be completed early this year and will be free to use			2
mr @entity8 , a law school dropout , has become something of an internet provocateur having already posted details about a plastic gun he made with a 3d printer			0
the 25 - year - old also put the blueprints online so that anybody could download them , attracting attention from the @entity84			0
speaking to the @entity85 , mr @entity8 said : ‘ we need an anonymous cash online			2
‘ it 's not that i want you to buy drugs			1
it 's just that i think you should have the freedom to do it			0
’ he added that @entity14 ‘ captures everything we want to do ’ and that ‘ my particular brand of activism is crisis - forcing			2
’ in a promotional @entity96 style video posted to @entity97 for @entity14 , @entity8 says that ‘ @entity3 is what they fear it is			1
’ mr @entity8 has raised $ 100,000 ( £ 60,600 ) for the project through online donations and another $ 150,000 ( £ 91,000 ) through other sources , with most of the money being donated in @entity3			1
he only began focusing his attention on @entity14 after his plastic gun , called ‘ liberator ’ , was effectively banned by the @entity107			0
it told him to remove the blueprints from the internet as they were in breach of arms export laws			0
@entity3 ’s security has been called into question recently after the @entity84 arrested the founder of @entity116 , which is allegedly the biggest internet drugs market in the word			2
@entity119 , 29 , spent two - and - a - half years running it and supposedly made $ 28.5 million off the trades , which were carried out in @entity3			2
he has now been charged with allegedly engaging in a drug trafficking , money laundering , conspiracy as well as computer hacking and attempted murder - for - hire			0
@entity116 , which allowed users to trade in illegal drugs , required transactions to be made using the virtual currency @entity3 @entity132 , a spokesman for the @entity65 government 's @entity133 , said it would be monitoring the situation			1
he said : ‘ we 'd be concerned about anything that would increase the threat level of money laundering			0
’ in mid-december the @entity3 virtual currency passed the $ 1,000 ( £ 613 ) mark for the first time since it was introduced in 2009			0
analysts claim the demand for @entity3 follows increased awareness about benefits of the currency and a drive to move it into the mainstream			0
the digital currency is increasingly being treated like gold , with some investors using it to hedge against currency fluctuations and speculating on its rise			0
@entity3 can be bought with near anonymity , which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy .			0

@entity14 app and web plug - in was created by @entity65 - based @entity8
he said the online wallet is set to ' change the way people spend money '
it will let users store , send and receive @entity3 privately and more securely
yet @entity8 expects people to use the untraceable system to buy drugs
