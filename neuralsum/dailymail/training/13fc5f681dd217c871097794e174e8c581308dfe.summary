she lost feeling in her toes , feet , and thighs and could n't even get out of bed without help – a devastating situation for a girl who had previously been a ballet dancer , swimmer , badminton player and horse rider			0
@entity6 , 24 , has defied medics to become a model ( left ) despite being struck down with a rare spinal condition that left her paralysed and meant she had learn to walk all over again ( right ) ms @entity6 was approached by agency @entity24 , and is now campaigning for more representation of disabled people in the modelling industry and the media after years of back pain , miss @entity6 was diagnosed with spinal stenosis due to a slipped disc in her back at just 15 years old			1
at 20 years old she underwent a nine hour operation to remove the slipped disc in her back			1
but when she woke up she had lost all mobility in the lower half of her body despite doctors warning her paralysis meant she faced life in a wheelchair , she underwent physiotherapy and fought hard to learn to walk all over again			1
and though at one point she ' thought her life was over ' , she has now launched a career as a model , and wants to inspire other people with mobility issues to follow their dreams			1
miss @entity6 , from @entity50 , said : ' when i realised i could n't walk i felt like my life was over - i could n't feel my feet and parts of my legs , it was horrendous - it was like i was paralysed			1
' i was so used to being active , i danced regularly , played @entity58 for the county , and swam competitively , but suddenly i could n't do anything at all			0
' learning to walk again was so difficult and frustrating - i got the nickname @entity62 at physio because i was so wobbly			2
' i was very determined , and taking my first steps was just amazing , but the experience left me with no confidence at all			0
' a friend suggested that i should try some modelling , as she had already done it , so i agreed to take some pictures with her for fun			0
spinal stenosis is the narrowing of the spinal canal			1
it can be caused by problems , including overgrowth of bone or other tissue or by a herniated disc			2
sometimes called a slipped disc or a ruptured disc , a herniated disc occurs when some of the softer ' jelly ' pushes out through a crack in the tougher exterior			2
when the spinal canal which surrounds the spinal cord gets too narrow , it can squeeze and choke the spinal cord or nearby nerve roots			1
spinal stenosis can cause pain , numbness , or weakness in the legs , buttocks , arms , or neck , depending on which area of the spine is affected			1
this is known medically as ' sciatica '			0
' before i knew it she 'd put them online , and i had photographers and brands contacting me to work with them - it was unbelievable			2
' despite her condition , miss @entity6 is determined to carve out a successful career for herself			1
she said : ' i still use my crutches all the time , and on a really bad day i 'll use a wheelchair , but i wo n't let that stop me			2
' i 'll try anything at shoots because i want to prove to the photographer that i 'm a good model			2
' i once modelled on a horse , and it threw me off backwards - everyone else was concerned about my back but i was more worried about my hair and make up			0
' i did a bridal shoot once , and one of the photographer 's helpers had to hide under my dress holding me steady because i was quite unstable on my feet			0
' but if there 's a pose or a shot that the photographer wants , i 'll do everything to make sure i can achieve it			0
' after years of living with pain , miss @entity6 was diagnosed with disc degenerative disease , where one of the discs in the spinal cord becomes worn away ( sometimes referred to as a ' slipped disc ' ) , causing pain in the back			1
she was also diagnosed with spinal stenosis – in which the spinal canal become narrowed , squeezing and choking the spinal cord or nearby nerve roots - causing pain , tingling and weakness in the back and legs ( known as sciatica ) , at just 15 years old			1
the disease stunned doctors , who had never seen a case in someone so young before			0
miss @entity6 said : ' when doctors first suspected i had the condition , they could n't quite believe it because it 's something that only happens to old people			1
' they wondered if i 'd some kind of trauma , but no one can work out why i have it - it 's just one of those things			0
though doctors said she faced a life in a wheelchair , miss @entity6 was determined to walk again			1
as her confidence had been shattered by the ordeal , a friend recommended she tried modelling			0
she discovered she loved being behind the camera and was approached by other photographers doctors were stunned when @entity180 was diagnosed with spinal stenosis at just 15 years old , as this condition is normally only seen in pensioners			1
she lost confidence after being left paralysed , but modelling gave her a new sense of purpose			0
she is pictured ( left and right ) posing in her own photographs before her diagnosis , miss @entity6 was a keen sportswoman			1
she is pictured on a family skiing holiday ' it 's funny because now my @entity192 , who is 82 , has been diagnosed with the same thing			0
' at 16 years old she underwent surgery to remove the part of the slipped disc that was pressing on her nerve , in the hope that it would reduce her back pain			1
however , four years later the pain returned and so doctors decided to carry out a more extreme operation to remove the disc entirely			1
it was after this operation @entity180 woke up unable to feel or move anything in her lower body			1
ms @entity6 said : ' they took a bone graft from my hip and put it where the disc was , then they put rods either side of the new disc and screwed it all in place			1
' it took nine hours and was supposed to be the cure i needed , but i woke up in agony and completely unable to walk			1
' the once active student woke up to a completely new life - and was horrified to discover that she had lost her mobility			2
after six months of physiotherapy , and feeling as though her life had been shattered by her paralysis , miss @entity6 is proud to have learned to walk @entity234 six months of physiotherapy , and feeling as though her life had been shattered by her paralysis , miss @entity6 is proud to have learned to walk again			1
' i was so young when i got this condition that there were no other people my age to talk to about it , i thought it was the @entity244 , ' miss @entity6 said			2
however , modelling gave her a new sense of purpose this was a known risk of the surgery - but was unexpected in miss @entity6 ' case			2
feeling as though her life as she knew it had been shattered , her journey to being able to walk again was difficult			2
she said : ' i was out of hospital , but i still had a long way to go , plus my confidence was at an all time low			0
' i 'd put on a lot of weight in hospital , and i just felt like a different person			0
' i could n't dance or do any sports , and i 'd lost my independence because i was so unsteady			0
' but after being introduced to modelling by a friend , she discovered a new sense of purpose			0
miss @entity6 said : ' my friend , who also has mobility issues , suggested i try modelling , as it had boosted her confidence too			2
' i had nothing to lose so i thought i may as well give it a go			0
' as soon as i got in front of the camera i loved it , and the response was amazing			0
before being diagnosed at 16 years old , miss @entity6 was a keen ballet dancer ( left ) , badminton player ( pictured right with a medal ) and horse rider			1
but she was blighted by agonising back pain now , miss @entity6 is trying to raise as much awareness of her condition as possible			1
' disabled people receive so little representation in the media , so @entity24 is trying to change that			0
i want to show people that you do n't have to let it hold you back - you can still achieve your dreams , ' she said ' i 'm now the face of some independent clothing labels , and i regularly pose for photographers			2
' i 'm also a model for @entity299 - a company that campaign for more diversity within the modelling industry			0

' i 'm really excited to be part of such an important campaign			0
' now , @entity6 is trying to raise as much awareness of her condition as possible through modelling			2
