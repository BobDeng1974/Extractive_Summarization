by @entity0 flooding threatens villages today , yet we are able to build defences such as walls and reservoirs			0
@entity8 people living in northern @entity9 had a more macabre solution , however			0
ancient settlements offered hacked children ’s skulls to the local lake gods in order to protect their homes , archaeologists have claimed			1
the skulls were found forming a protective ring around settlements near lakes in @entity22 and @entity23			1
victims of war : while some of the skulls show signs of head trauma , including slashes inflicted by axes ( pictured ) it is not thought that the children were human sacrifices the skulls were discovered around the perimeter of three ancient villages in modern day @entity22 and @entity23			1
some of them show signs of head trauma as the result of blows from an axe and club			1
archaeologists think that the children were victims of war , rather than of ritual human sacrifice			1
they were placed by @entity8 people at the point at which the lakes flooded their homes			2
experts think they were used as offering to place the lake gods in a bid to mitigate the flooding			1
it is thought that the skulls were relatively old when they were re purposed as a macabre type of flood defence			0
while some of the skulls show signs of head trauma - including slashes inflicted by axes - it is not thought that the children were human sacrifices			1
instead , experts from @entity67 , @entity22 believe that bones from long - dead children were offered to lake gods in order to keep rising water levels at bay			1
the study , published in the journal @entity76 , says : ‘ several of the children had suffered violent deaths , through blows to the head from axes or blunt instruments			0
‘ they do not appear to have been human sacrifices , but the skulls may nonetheless have been offerings to the gods by communities faced with the threat of environmental change			1
’ mapped : the macabre approach to flood prevention has been found at three sites ( marked on this map )			0
ancient people placed the skulls of children around the perimeters of the villages , especially in places where the water levels rose @entity102 , an archaeologist at the university , explained that the @entity8 lake dwellers faced regular flooding and often moved away from lakes to drier land , only to return later when the water receded			1
in order to maximise the time they could spend by the lakes , they built specially adapted houses			0
‘ the houses were either elevated on stilts ( if the village was erected close to or in the water ) , or on top of a well - insulated wooden surface built directly on the ground ( if the settlement was far enough from the lake - shore ) , ’ the study says			1
and to supplement such practical defences , they also took more superstitious measures			0
archaeologists uncovered ‘ evidence of unusual and macabre human behaviour intended to counter the threat of environmental change ’			0
placed with precision : the archeologist said : ' at the sites , the remains are found at the perimeter of the settlement - not inside and not outside , but at a liminal position on the border between in and out '			2
the drawing shows their location around the village boundaries the ancient people placed the skulls of children around the village ’s perimeter , especially in places where the water levels rose particularly dramatically			1
archaeologists think the bones were intended as ‘ gifts to the gods long after primary burial , in order to stop the threatening floods			1
’ these winged axes from @entity157 are similar in form to the ones that would have been used in @entity8 battles and inflicted the head wounds on the children ‘ a striking similarity that binds all the child skeletal remains together is the location where they were deposited ; all of them were found near the settlement perimeter , ’ the study says			2
‘ all the remains were deposited exactly at the time when the severity of flooding became greater			0
’ by analysing the skulls , the experts found that most of the children were under 10 years old when they died			2
while they found evidence of tooth decay and respiratory diseases , they said that they would not have been enough to kill the children			0
instead , the archaeologists believe that they died as a result of blows to the head with axes and clubs , which would probably have been sustained during a war			2
they said they the injuries were not similar enough to suggest a type of ritual killing , or human sacrifice			2
dr @entity102 told @entity194 : ‘ across @entity9 as a whole there is quite a body of evidence to indicate that throughout prehistory human remains , and particularly the skull , were highly symbolic and socially charged			0
’ at the sites , ‘ the remains are found at the perimeter of the settlement - not inside and not outside , but at a liminal position on the border between in and out			2
’ archaeologists first discovered the ancient alpine villages in 1854 but they were only excavated - yielding bones , dwellings , tools , pottery and jewellery - in the 1970s			0
some wooden artefacts suggest that people lived in such settlements between 3,800 and 2,600 years ago , but little is known about their belief system			0
dr @entity102 said : ‘ there are very few instance or examples of burials in the vicinity of the lake settlements , and so we really do not know where the majority of the lake dwellers are buried , or how they treated their dead			0
’ hacked : archaeologists believe that the skulls were intended as ' gifts to the gods long after primary burial , in order to stop the threatening floods '			1
some of the bones analysed show wounds inflicted by axes and clubs during a war ( illustrated )			0

skulls were found forming a protective rings around settlements near lakes in @entity22 and @entity23
archaeologists from the @entity67 , @entity22 said they were offered to local lake gods to protect their homes from flooding
some show signs of head trauma from war - not human sacrifice
the children were killed long before their remains were used as offerings
to mitigate effect of floods , the ancient people also built their homes on stilts
