staying healthy has become a national obsession – certainly if our reading habits are anything to go by			2
last year , @entity4 spent a staggering £ 47.4 million on health - related books in a bid to shed our muffin tops , relieve what ails us , and render us less stressed			1
while nearly every other area of publishing shrinks , this is one sector still doing roaring business			2
read yourself healthy : @entity15 , associate editor at @entity16 , ( not pictured ) reviews her top - five health books 2014 sales this year are expected to continue to grow			1
perhaps wearying of unrealistic fitness regimes , we are disciplining ourselves instead with @entity21 and the @entity22 ( two of the biggest sellers for a second year running ) , increasingly going sour on sugar , as recommended by the @entity26 , and juicing every last nutrient out of everything from blueberries to @entity31 sprouts			2
as an associate editor at @entity16 , i get an early peek at some truly useful , life - enhancing books which do n’t necessarily subscribe to the latest craze			1
these are five of my best from 2014 ... later ! a guide to parenting a @entity40 and @entity41 ( @entity42 , £ 14.99 ) there are dozens of books on bringing up a baby or training your toddler , but almost nothing on young adults			1
with my firstborn fast approaching 17 , i was delighted to see this one			2
amid helpful case histories and thought - provoking exercises , there is a great deal of sensible advice on such contentious topics as career paths , first love and the @entity61			1
it gently reassured me too that my lovely son is not the recluse i was worried he might be			0
helpful tomes : later ! a guide to parenting a @entity67 and we need to @entity69 : how to be a friend to the one who ’s left behind we need to talk about grief : how to be a friend to the one who ’s left behind by @entity75 ( @entity42 , £ 12.99 ) after my father died of cancer last december , i ’ve been thinking a lot about what has helped			0
thousands of people find themselves in the same situation , yet i have found few books that truly articulate the kind of feelings which rise up			1
then i fell upon the compassionate approach of someone who lost her mother to cancer			0
@entity75 combines candid first - person stories of bereavement with sensible and sensitive advice underno - nonsense headings			1
she also makes a heartfelt plea for thosewho would rather cross the road than speak to a bereaved friend toget to grips with death , which is something i feel needs to be said			0
the @entity100 by @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 ( @entity104 , £ 10.99 ) i am suspicious of diets which claim to be both effective and delicious , but the recipes in @entity107 , based on a typical @entity109 peasant diet ( vegetables , pulses , fruit , nuts , wholegrains and olive oil ) have enticed me to try them from next month			1
the method involves fasting for three days , eating moderately for three and feasting on the seventh			0
the monks of @entity100 are among the healthiest people in the world			0

but in this book @entity133 , who takes her mantra from @entity144 ( ‘ no one is young over 40 , but one can be irresistible at any age ’ ) , shares her knowledge on ageing with a style and attitude that is indeed hard to resist			1
she covers everything from hair and shoes ( the two biggest ‘ tells ’ , apparently ) to proper breathing , and the benefits of going to bed an hour earlier twice a week when you ’re aged over 50			0
and @entity151 ? just say non ! where @entity127 : why @entity153 by @entity154 ( two roads , £ 16.99 ) sadly , dementia has been a dominant theme among the bestselling books on illness this year			2
@entity154 ’s is a personal and humane approach to the distress and challenges of the condition , but also a call for us to reconsider how we look after society ’s most fragile			0
i ’m also pressing everyone to read @entity169 : illness , @entity171 by @entity172 .			0
