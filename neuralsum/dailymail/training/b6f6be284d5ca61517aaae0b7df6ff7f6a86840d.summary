by @entity0 psychologists have found that adding a lot of detail to a fabricated story is the easiest way to remember a lie most people have told a lie only to be caught out later on when they mix up a story or forget about the fib all together			1
but now psychologists have found that adding a lot of detail to a fabricated story is the easiest way to remember a lie and not get caught out			1
@entity16 scientists said a lie that consists of simple denial does n't become so ingrained in our memory and could therefore be more easily busted at a later date			1
psychologists have found it is harder to remember a false denial than a made - up description , which could have important implications for forensic interrogation			1
even telling the truth when denying something can lead to a guilty feeling			0
for example , the scientists said a suspect who repeatedly refutes being at a crime may actually begin to imagine where it was , what it looked like and who was present , causing the scene to feel strangely familiar even if they were not there			0
the phenomenon is known as the â € ˜ illusory truth effectâ € ™ when hearing false information repeatedly makes it appear correct , and in a courtroom can be disastrous			2
professor @entity46 , of @entity47 , said : ' they are telling the truth , they are denying , but later this thing seems familiar			2
they are confusing the familiarity of the repetition with the truth , not realising those repeated denials are what makes it seem familiar 48 hours later			2
' humans remember false descriptions well because of the effort required to make them up			1
when subjects in a study were asked to recall these 48 hours later , they remembered accurately what they had said and that it was untrue			0
psychologists have found it is harder to remember a false denial than a false description including a few memorable details , which could have important implications for forensic interrogation the same is not true for false denials			1
denying something that actually happened is often brief , and its cognitive demand is therefore much smaller			0
professor @entity46 explained : ' i am not constructing details			0
but i am also not going to remember the act because there is not much cognitively involved in the denial			2
' the ' illusory truth effect ' - when hearing false information repeatedly makes it appear correct - can prove disastrous in a courtroom his participants had a hard time remembering their own false denials after 48 hours			1
in a series of rapid fire questions a guilty suspect is more inclined to forget a false denial and therefore more likely to contradict himself on the same information later			0
but there is also a frightening implication for the innocent , as the volunteers also had a hard time remembering if the denials they had made were true or false			1
this same memory problem might plague suspects asked to make repeated truthful denials			2
the study , published in the @entity105 and @entity106 , says false descriptions and false denials are two separate kinds of lies that use different mental machinery			1
professor @entity46 said : ' if i am going to lie to you about something that did not happen , i am going to have to keep a lot of different constraints in mind			0
' liars must remember what they say and also monitor how plausible they seem and the depth of detail they offer as well as how confident they appear to the listener			0
if the listener does not appear to be buying it , they must also adapt the story accordingly			0
professor @entity46 said : ' as the constructive process lays down records of our details and descriptions , it also lays down information about the process of construction			0

@entity16 psychologists said fictional descriptions and false denials are two separate kinds of lies that use different mental machinery
@entity47 *research* found humans remember false descriptions well because of the effort required to make them up
*worryingly* volunteers involved in the study had a hard time remembering if the denials they had made were true or false
