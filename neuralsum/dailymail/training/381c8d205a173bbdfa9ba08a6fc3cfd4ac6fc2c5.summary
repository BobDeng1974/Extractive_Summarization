@entity0 begins his test career as @entity3 ’s wicket - keeper batsman on sunday but just a few years ago the former child prodigy was a reluctant gloveman			1
the 23 - year - old former @entity6 star — whose remarkable ball - striking ability has drawn comparisons with @entity10 and @entity11 — caught the attention of @entity3 ’s hierarchy at a early age , once scoring 227 not out for his school first xi in a record 340 - run partnership in 2008			1
the player who had the best view in the house that day , former school friend and current @entity6 batsman @entity18 , says the man making his test debut in place of 79 - cap veteran @entity26 today was not always a willing wicket - keeper			1
catching practice : @entity0 in an @entity3 nets session on saturday debutant : he is set to make his test bow for @entity3 against @entity32 on sunday ‘ @entity33 was actually very reluctant to keep at school , ’ @entity18 said			1
‘ on several occasions he ’d hand the gloves over to someone else so he could have a bowl			1
he was a very good keeper but did n’t really enjoy it			1
' he did n’t really want to do it but he ’s come on a long way and done a huge amount of work which is testament to him for becoming a @entity46 keeper			1
but there were many times at school he did n’t fancy it			1
’ with his opportunities at @entity52 limited by former @entity3 keeper @entity53 , @entity0 moved to @entity54 from @entity6 this winter to gain regular wicket - keeping opportunities at first - class level			1
he has worked tirelessly with wicketkeeping coach @entity57 and is entrusted with the gloves at the @entity59 following @entity26 ’s decision to take a break			1
he is the least experienced wicketkeeper @entity3 have selected in the past 50 years in terms of first - class appearances , apart from @entity65 skipper @entity64 who made his test debut against @entity32 in 2001			1
@entity0 ’s one - day credentials are already established and his astonishing innings of 121 from 74 balls in a losing cause against @entity71 at @entity72 in may led to calls from many — including @entity75 — for him to be elevated even sooner			1
‘ @entity33 ’s ball - striking was always pretty exceptional , ’ said @entity18			2
‘ he was able to clear the boarding house at one end and the science block from the first xi square at school , which was around a 100m carry			2
' no - one else could get close but @entity33 could hit it over pretty regularly and pretty comfortably			2
he could always hit the ball a long way			2
he could also always hit the ball in strange areas , too			2
‘ we batted together in a @entity90 tournament at @entity91 and he walked down the wicket to me in one game and said “ i ’m going to try to hit this guy over point for six ”			2
in my naivety i wondered how the hell he was going to cut the ball for six , but the next ball he came down and he said : “ i ’m going to reverse sweep him for six ”			2
and that ’s exactly what he did			2
‘ he spent a lot more time practising those sorts of skills at a younger age than most other people			2
’ pedigree : he is already established in limited overs cricket for @entity3 backup : in training with captain @entity116 ( centre ) and @entity118 ( right ) @entity0 ’s parents , @entity120 and @entity121 , will be at the @entity59 today to witness his test debut			1
‘ @entity33 was a bowler at a young age but when one of his team ’s wicket keepers was ill and the other was injured on that day , @entity33 took over , and that was it , ’ @entity120 told the @entity123			2
‘ one thing that he has had ever since he was born is incredible hand - eye co-ordination			2
it means if there ’s something to be hit or something to be caught , he has the natural ability to do it			0
’ @entity33 honed his skills as a youngster by playing against his older brother @entity139 , seven years his senior , in the garden of their family home in the @entity6 village of @entity146			0
@entity121 said : ‘ we had a mown strip up the top of the garden and they would charge in at each other , smashing around the place			0
@entity154 were broken , the greenhouse was in pieces but they played and played			0
‘ because there were so many years between them , if @entity33 wanted to play he had to play as hard as his older brother			0
they were so competitive and still are			0
they still play whenever they ’re both here			0
‘ people have told us that @entity33 is the same as @entity75			0
they go because he ’s playing , he ’s got something special to inspire a crowd			0
’ @entity0 turned down the chance to be a school prefect in order to concentrate on his cricket and a-levels in his final year at @entity172 , @entity52 , a @entity174 boarding school he attended through a cricket scholarship won aged 13			1
‘ he was an unbelievable cricketer and clearly a class above everybody else , ’ said headmaster @entity176			0
‘ there was no doubt he would go on to succeed in the game			0
but he was n’t just a cricketer , he was also an exceptionally talented rugby player who i have no doubt could have gone on to make a living out of that			1
he played hockey very well and was also a bright boy who did very well in his a-levels			0
‘ he was modest , softly spoken and a great ambassador for the school			0
the only place he pushed himself on to the centre stage was on the cricket field			1
he was never arrogant and everybody liked him			0
’ batsman : according to a school friend , he was a reluctant wicketkeeper growing up safe hands : but he has been working hard with @entity6 to prepare for his chance when it comes @entity0 was soon on @entity6 ’s radar where former @entity3 batsman @entity201 — county captain in the @entity202 of a side containing @entity11 and @entity10 — immediately spotted his promise			1
‘ i was fortunate enough at @entity6 to see @entity11 emerging and one or two others , ’ said @entity205			0
‘ i ’ve seen @entity33 play cricket since he was 13 and it was immediately apparent to me he was going to play at the highest level			1
‘ there are not many people you can say that about			0
people as talented as @entity33 will always get through			0
' his hand - eye co-ordination and ability to hit the ball anywhere in the ground takes me back a long time to when i was watching people like @entity11 and @entity10 , one of the greatest cricketers ever to play			0
‘ i think @entity33 has that special ability			0
his big challenge is to bat for longer periods in first - class cricket			1
’ at just under six feet , @entity0 is relatively tall for a wicket - keeper			1
‘ initially i doubted he ’d be a wicketkeeper because of his height , ’ @entity205 added			1
‘ but he ’s naturally flexible and is good on his feet			0
his glovework has come on a lot and he ’s been helped a lot by @entity239 over the last couple of years			0
‘ he ’s a natural athlete so the more he keeps practising with soft hands he ’ll be fine			0

@entity0 was a reluctant wicketkeeper when he was growing up
set to make @entity3 test debut against @entity32 on sunday
already established at national level in limited overs cricket
@entity3 on a run of ten tests without a *victory*
