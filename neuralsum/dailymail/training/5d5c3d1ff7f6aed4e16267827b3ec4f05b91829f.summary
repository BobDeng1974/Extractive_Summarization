@entity0 scored a stunning brace against @entity2 as @entity3 ran out comfortable winners in @entity5			1
@entity6 also scored two as the @entity8 won away from home in their final @entity11 group game for the first time since 1999			1
here , @entity13 gives their player ratings			0
@entity15 @entity16 6 the goalkeeper did n't have too much to do but came out for a cross which he missed , showing there was a little bit of rust present			0
relatively composed on his return though			0
@entity6 rifles in @entity3 's opening goal after just three minutes against @entity2 @entity24 8 ( @entity25 77mins ) played excellently on his return to the starting line - up after three months out			1
loves going forward but was tested a little defensively in the second half and made sure to help out the youngsters who came off the bench			2
per mertesacker 7.5 put the weekend 's horror show at the @entity33 behind him			2
composed in possession and won a few nice balls in the air so @entity3 could build from the back			1
also made a crucial last - ditch block midway through the second half to keep @entity2 out			1
@entity40 7 there will be far harder tests to come for @entity43 if he is to play centre back regularly because he was barely tested by @entity46 or @entity47 until the 55th minute			2
the @entity8 goalkeeper congratulates the former @entity50 midfielder @entity51 7 assured on the ball and calm for someone with so little first - team experience			2
you can see from his ability to fly forward why @entity58 rates him so highly			0
@entity0 9 ( @entity59 46 ) back to his best before being subbed to protect him at half - time			1
his first goal was a lovely placed finish across the keeper but his second was out of this world			2
surely the best strike in the @entity11 this season			0
honestly , you must see this goal - @entity0 barely swings his left foot at it but he arrows a volley straight into the top left - hand corner			1
@entity74 6 ( @entity75 45 ) sometimes struggled to contain the industrious @entity76 but overall shielded his back four well			1
will want a few more games as easy as this			0
made way at half - time after getting booked			1
@entity3 's players react to the @entity83 's brilliant volley to take the score to 3 - 0 in @entity5 @entity85 9 if @entity0 had n't scored twice , @entity85 would undoubtedly be man of the match			1
everything he did was positive , particularly in the first half , and he drove @entity3 forward			1
need to see more performances like the first 45 minutes though			0
@entity90 7 will be a bit frustrated he did n't mark his starting appearance with a goal and looked a bit rusty			2
caused a lot of problems down the right though			0
@entity6 8 when he starts he tends to score			1
the @entity98 has a thunderbolt of a right foot and he used it to set the @entity8 on their way after only three minutes and added another late on			2
frustrates at times , but his finishing ability is without question			0
@entity85 had a good game and kept up his record of playing in every match this seasson @entity108 6 did not take his opportunity on this occasion			0
caused a few problems but was the poorest of @entity3 's attacking trio			1
still extremely raw and does not always hold the ball up well enough			0
substitutes @entity117 ( replaced @entity0 46 ) 6 - unfortunately for @entity3 's fluidity and intensity slacked off in the second half			1
he still looked extremely confident for one so young though , and gave a couple of really nice through balls			0
made one very important clearance too			0
@entity75 ( replaced @entity74 45 ) 7 - looks composed on the ball and can slot into the team nicely			0
will not have been introduced into a game where there was so little to do before , mind			0
young full back @entity51 showed plenty of promise in the @entity11 clash @entity25 ( replaced @entity24 77 ) 6 - very little time to make much of an impact but looked composed for the small period he was on the field			2
subs not used : @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139			0
@entity2 @entity140 5 , @entity141 3 ( @entity142 45 , 6 ) , @entity143 3 , @entity144 4 , @entity145 5 , @entity146 6 ( @entity147 77 , 6 ) , @entity148 4 , @entity149 5 , @entity76 7.5 , @entity150 4 ( @entity151 45 , 5 ) , @entity47 5 @entity142 celebrates with @entity76 after the @entity152 scored a consolation goal for the hosts @entity155 pleased with ' dangerous ' @entity3			1

@entity6 scored in the third minute for @entity3 in @entity157
@entity0 doubled @entity3 's lead *shortly* afterwards
the @entity83 scored a magnificent second goal before half time
@entity6 added his second in the final minute of the game
@entity76 netted a brilliant free - kick for the hosts
