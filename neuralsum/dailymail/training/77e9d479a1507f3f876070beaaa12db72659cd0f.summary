' it was a lovely service but when we drove into the cemetery i had a funny feeling something was n’t right as there was nobody there and there were no workmen about			2
' the funeral director said to me ‘ just hang on and i ’ll go and find out what ’s happening ’ and i knew that something was wrong			2
' the funeral director then said ‘ i ’m sorry i do n’t know how to tell you this but they have not dug the grave			1

' when the coffin was being lowered it went in at a slant			2
' the head of the coffin was about three inches from the top of the ground and the bottom of the coffin was about 10 inches from the top			0
