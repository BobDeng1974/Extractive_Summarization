the move comes after a report by the @entity15 attorney general found that the theft of @entity17 has fallen significantly in the six months since @entity5 introduced the security features to its mobile operating system			1
a kill switch gives users the power to completely disable a smartphone remotely after it has been stolen			1
it also increases security on the phone by adding more password layers , to make it more difficult to wipe and then be sold on by thieves			0
according to the report , since the @entity7 feature was added to @entity5 ’s @entity33 last year , the number of @entity17 related robberies has fallen by 24 per cent in @entity35 , 17 per cent in @entity15 and 39 per cent in @entity36			1
the figures came from @entity5 statistics and crime rates supplied by local law enforcement			2
@entity35 figures were supplied as part of the @entity43 ( @entity45 ) initiative			1
the feature requires the entry of a passcode in order to disable location services on the device			0
earlier this year , @entity4 introduced a similar feature called @entity53 to some of its @entity56 smartphones , which allows users to lock their phone remotely should it go missing , or be stolen			1
the report confirmed that following the launch of @entity61 , supported by the mayor of @entity35 , @entity63 , @entity1 and @entity0 will be improving the security on their mobile devices			1

a ' soft ' kill switch , such as those currently offered , allow a person to block a thief from accessing their phone			1
this lets them disable their handset , add extra layers of security , and protect their personal data on it			0
@entity1 and @entity0 will both add the feature to their next software update			1
while the feature will be welcomed by many , some experts think the only true way to stop data being exploited on stolen mobiles , or the handsets being sold on , is to damage them permanently			2
this is because the current services rely on a signal to be activated , which can be blocked if a thief turns off a phone or puts it in airplane mode straight away			0
a ' hard ' kill switch would render a handset completely useless and the police are in favour of such a move , to stop the trade - in of stolen handsets			1
it said : ' with the release of this report , the @entity120 achieves two major milestones : @entity1 confirms it will incorporate a killswitch - type theft - deterrence solution in the next release of its @entity128 operating system , which will run on all @entity130 smartphones			2
and , @entity0 confirms it will incorporate a killswitch - type theft - deterrence solution in its next version of the @entity135 operating system , the most popular mobile operating system worldwide			1

with these additional features , we ’re hopeful that technology - as part of a broader strategy - can help to further reduce incentives for criminals to steal smartphones in the first place			0
' experts still want firmer kill switches to be introduced that permanently disable smartphones			2
those used at the moment by @entity5 and @entity4 rely on a signal being sent to the phone to lock it , or a password to keep out unwanted users			1
but experts have warned that turning a phone off or placing it in airline mode can block signal from reaching it			0
