by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor , in @entity2 , @entity3			1
@entity4 , the center - right @entity6 personality who served in @entity9 from 1995 to 2001 , is leaving the door open for a 2016 presidential run , but @entity12 in the critical primary state of @entity3 do n't seem to care			1
wearing a @entity17 - friendly blue tie , the ' @entity15 ' host told the @entity18 that he would leave the door open for a return to politics , especially because ' we do n't need to elect another @entity23 for eight years			1
' @entity4 entered a @entity2 , @entity3 hotel to cheers			1
but after he moderated a panel discussion with four 2012 campaign operatives , @entity12 activists seemed not to take him seriously			2
' do you think @entity4 is serious about running for office ? ' @entity31 asked 25 conference attendees			1
' would you consider supporting him if he did ? ' @entity33 was 0 - for - 25			1
not a single attendee selected at random answered yes to either question			0
@entity4 entered to cheers but left many @entity3 republicans thinking he 's not worth a presidential glance serious @entity39 ? instead of commanding a central speaking slot , @entity33 emceed a panel discussion with campaign operatives from the 2012 presidential primaries @entity33 's center - right morning show is a bright spot in @entity6 's otherwise lackluster ratings , but he angered conservatives when he came out in favor of gun control proposals many @entity18 attendees see @entity33 as an entertaining pundit but dismiss him as a political leader and the results of a straw poll , announced hours later , must have brought disappointment to @entity33 if he fancies himself a serious candidate			1
although @entity59 announced this week to great fanfare that @entity4 's name would be on the ballot , he won so little support that he was entirely absent from the results			2
republicans in @entity2 were left to assume that his supporters were lumped into the nebulous ' other ' category			0
the lowest vote totals reported before dinner on saturday belonged to sen. @entity70 and former @entity72 ambassador @entity71 , with 3 per cent apiece			0
@entity73 who spoke with @entity31 seemed to see it coming			2
' are you serious ? he 's still an entertainer on @entity6 , ' replied a man from @entity79 , jabbing at the network 's much - discussed leftward tilt			2
@entity4 himself tried to dismiss his affiliation with the network that broadcasts @entity85 and @entity86			2
' yes , i am a conservative , ' he said , ' despite the network i work at			0
and reverend @entity85 says hello			0
' the joke earned him only a few titters			0
' it 's not like i would pick @entity33 over @entity97 [ @entity23 ] , ' a student from @entity94 told @entity31 , ' but , come on			1
i think he 's trying to sell books , or maybe he 's in a mid-life crisis			0
' in @entity2 , @entity4 signed copies of his november 2013 tome ' @entity102 : from @entity103 to @entity104 , how @entity105 – and can again ' @entity33 is pegging himself as a party unifier with crossover appeal , trying to bridge the ideological gulf between conservatives and more moderate @entity12			1
but in an era where neither the @entity114 centrists nor the @entity116 tea partiers seem eager to compromise , a self - appointed referee is likely to attract scorn from both sides			0
first in the nation : @entity12 pols made the trip to @entity2 , @entity3 hoping to build momentum toward the 2016 @entity12 primary @entity33 signed books in @entity3 but did n't go far in winning electoral support among @entity12 activists media circus : a day earlier , former @entity129 sen. @entity128 attracted a crush of national attention by announcing that he would try to return to the @entity132 as a @entity133 and his switch of allegiances on gun control following the 2012 @entity137 in @entity138 , @entity139 , won him new fans – on the political left			1
i had a little talk with him about the @entity146 , ' coastal @entity3 resident @entity142 told @entity31			1
' it did n't go well for @entity33			2
' @entity33 's low - taxes , limited - government messaging has broad appeal , but that wo n't necessarily convince activists on the right – who largely drive results in early presidential primary states like @entity3 – to elevate him from background strategist to contender			1
' the media loves it ' when far - right conservatives stir the pot , he said , ' but crazy never wins			0
' he rode into @entity9 following the @entity105 ' landslide in 1994 , joining @entity166 and other conservatives in a ' contract with @entity1 ' agenda of privatizing federal agencies and a @entity1 withdrawal from the @entity72			0
his bill shutting down the @entity1 @entity173 passed in the @entity174 as part of a larger budget resolution , but was ultimately left on the cutting room floor in negotiations with other @entity12 in the @entity132			0
but instead of pushing crowd - pleasing ideological positions , or directly taking on president @entity181 , @entity4 talked tactics			0
' we have lost our way over the past several years , ' he said			2
' you win by knocking on doors			0

' we have lost our way over the past several years , ' said the former @entity12 *congressman*
the @entity3 @entity12 event will *include* @entity33 in a straw poll of attendees
after @entity4 spoke , @entity31 polled 25 @entity12 *stalwarts* , and none of them said they would seriously consider voting for him
the lone @entity12 to host an @entity6 show has been cagey about *re-entering* politics
