by @entity0 published : 06:59 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 01:52 est , 24 september 2013 actress @entity1 shocked the world when she announced the late princess @entity3 had given her ' permission ' to play her on screen			2
but she is not the only one who believes the tragic royal is communicating with them from beyond the grave			0
@entity10 and @entity11 , who describe themselves as ' @entity14 's biggest @entity3 fanatics ' , claim to have experienced ' unmistakable ' signals from the former @entity3 - and even believe they have seen her spirit			1
@entity11 , 74 , said : ' we 've loved @entity3 from day @entity36 was something about that young lady that just drew you to her			1
we ca n't explain it - we just loved her			0
' but it was n't until after her untimely death in @entity44 in 1997 that they decided to formalise their devotion by co-founding the ' @entity47 @entity14 '			0
' there are seven of us all together and we started this two years after @entity3 died , ' said @entity11			1
' we were all standing outside @entity51 and we said " this woman must never be forgotten - we must keep her memory alive "			0
' every inch of their modest bungalow is now dedicated to @entity3 and they have so many photographs , sketches , plates and dolls that they are considering getting planning permission for an extension - or even erecting a tent in their garden			2
collection : @entity11 and @entity10 have amassed memorabilia worth many thousands of pounds over the last 30 years shrine : the couple are convinced @entity3 was murdered and was ' like a lamb to the slaughter ' they believe the huge collection could be worth a five - figure sum but say they would never sell any of the memorabilia			1
' we 're not worried about the money in this , we just buy , buy , buy , ' said @entity10 , 76			0
the couple say they are also in contact with @entity3 's former butler @entity24 and speak to him ' once a week '			1
they constantly study the circumstances of her death and have no doubt she was murdered			0
' she was a like a lamb to the slaughter , ' said @entity10 , who recently lost his sight and believes @entity3 helped him through his stay in hospital			2
' we do n't think the truth will come out in our time - but it will in years to come			0
' like @entity3 , who was once friends with tv medium @entity99 , @entity10 and @entity11 are spiritualists and say they have forged a bond with @entity3			1
spooky : according to @entity11 , @entity3 's face briefly appeared on a @entity106 fairy one year before fading away memory : the pair co-founded the @entity47 @entity14 and hope to keep memories of the late princess alive according to the couple , signs include white feathers that have mysteriously fallen from the sky and a special @entity3 candle which went out as her body was taken back to her childhood home of @entity118 in @entity119			1
they also have a rose bush in their back garden , which they say develops red blotches around the day of @entity3 's death , which they call ' blood spots '			1
however , the strongest signal to date came at christmas one year , recalls @entity11			2
' i 'll never forget it , ' she said			0
' we were at my sister 's one year and she always had a big christmas tree for her grandchildren			2
i just happened to glance up and instead of the fairy on top of the tree there was @entity3 's face - and she was just looking down smiling			1
' then she gradually faded away until she was gone			0
we are not spooky or anything but we believe it			0
we do n't care what other people say			0
' disapproval : the @entity146 have said that they are not impressed by the new biopic of princess @entity3 despite their determination to keep @entity3 's memory alive , they are horrified by the release of the new film , @entity3 , which hit cinemas earlier this month			1
@entity11 , who says the only royals she has time for are the @entity154 and @entity155 and prince @entity156 , said : ' we 've got no time for this @entity3 film			2
i think in a way it 's disgusting they 've done this because 16 years on and that young girl could not be laid to rest			0
' it 's ruining @entity3 's reputation , that poor girl			1
she 's done a lot for this country			0
' with the closing of the official @entity3 museum last month , @entity11 and @entity10 's next step is to try and inspire the next generation of @entity3 fans to continue the efforts of the @entity47 @entity14 , and preserve the memory of the @entity3 for years to come .			1
