a lorry driver has been jailed for seven years for killing his friend who asked him to test out his new ' bulletproof ' vest - with a shotgun			1
@entity4 , 40 , and close friend @entity5 were in a farmer 's field near @entity8 , @entity9 , when he fired at his chest from less than 20ft away and killed him almost instantly			1
a court heard today that mr @entity5 had visited a military surplus store the previous day and was ' very keen ' to test the effectiveness of his new kit			1
@entity4 , 40 , ( left ) has been jailed for seven years after he killed his friend @entity5 ( right ) with a shotgun when he was asked to help him try out his new ' bulletproof ' vest prosecutor @entity18 described it as a ' protective ' vest , although the victim believed it to be bullet - proof			1
@entity24 was told that after leaving @entity25 in @entity26 he went to the pub the following evening - june 29 last year - wearing the vest and a @entity30 cap			2
he had already asked another friend - @entity31 - to help him test it out but he had flatly refused and then asked more people when he got to the pub. prosecutor mr @entity18 said that the vest - far from being bulletproof - had a plastic casing that actually funnelled the shotgun spray into the centre of mr @entity5 's chest , slicing an artery			1
he added that mr @entity4 attempted to save his friend : ' he was panicking , upset and swearing			2
when @entity4 fired his shotgun ( file image ) at mr @entity5 from less than 20ft away , the shotgun spray was funnelled into the centre of his chest , slicing an artery			1
paramedics were called but he died almost instantly ' but it was clear to the paramedics at first sight that there was very little that could be done to save mr @entity5 's life			1
' he said @entity4 had first claimed he had been aiming for a pigeon and hit his friend by accident , but quickly came clean			0
mr @entity5 bought what was described as a ' protective ' vest , which he incorrectly believed was bullet - poof like the one pictured			2
file photo defence barrister @entity63 argued that the killing was the result of a stupid and reckless act to which the ' keen ' mr @entity5 had nevertheless consented			2
' ( mr @entity5 ) was very proud of it			0
he 'd gone to the pub that evening wearing that vest and indeed a @entity30 cap , ' mr @entity63 said			1
' after a drink or so , he asked more people , and mr @entity4 agreed to do a stupid and undoubtedly reckless act			1
' he pleaded guilty to manslaughter last november and appeared in the dock today for sentencing			0
judge @entity77 , handing down the sentence , said : ' you shot mr @entity5 at a distance of less than 20 feet , causing him catastrophic injuries and immediate death			2
' you then , straight away , took him to hospital but tragically , nothing could be done to save his life			0
' @entity4 stared straight ahead in the dock as the sentence came down , while his mother appeared to fight back tears from the public gallery			0
the court heard the two friends had been close and @entity4 had nightmares about what he had done			0
' your remorse is complete and genuine , ' the judge said			0
' you recognise the magnitude of your actions and i have no doubt that the effects of killing your good friend will last with you for the rest of your life			0
' but he said @entity4 , as a gun licence - holder , had ' manifestly breached those obligations and duties '			0
@entity4 will serve up to half his seven - year term , and the judge ordered that his gun be forfeited and destroyed			0
@entity24 , pictured , heard the vest - far from being bulletproof - had a plastic casing that actually funnelled the shotgun spray into the centre of mr @entity5 's chest , slicing an artery			1

@entity4 , 40 , shot and killed close friend @entity5 in a farmer 's field
