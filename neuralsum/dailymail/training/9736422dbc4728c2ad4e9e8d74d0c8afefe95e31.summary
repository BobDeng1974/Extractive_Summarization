@entity8 and her husband sir @entity9 ( pictured ) carried out a number of alterations to their £ 12million home in the wealthy @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 workers on site have described the home as ‘ unspectacular ’ and claim it is not as grand as they believed it to be			1
in fact , they will spend the next 18 months renovating the property into a ‘ traditional home ’ and rid it of previous alterations which are ‘ not fitting ’ with the original character of the property			1
the house was bought by the @entity8 in 1990 , shortly after the @entity8 left @entity41			1
it was purchased from the @entity43 , who owns the leasehold , and they spent more than a decade living at the property and carrying out improvements			1
it was later sold to a property group based in the @entity50 in 2006 , though @entity8 remained living there until a few months before her death in april last year			1
the latest owners now want to reverse some of the changes the @entity8 made to the property , which included lowering the ceilings , adding an ‘ unsympathetic ' extension , fitting carpet throughout and installing modern doors			1
according to planning submissions received by @entity61 , the plans to renovate the property include efforts to rid it of previous alterations			1

it states : ‘ planning records indicate that a comprehensive refurbishment scheme was undertaken in the early 1990s , including the building of a rear range extending the house up to the mews lane at the rear			0
‘ as found today , the existing rear closet wing of the house does not retain its original form or appearance			0
‘ evidence suggests that this element has been considerably altered during the 20th century			0
this has resulted in an unbalanced and unsympathetic appearance			0
‘ there is a traditional style interior scheme throughout , which also appears to be largely modern and of a design rather overly grand for a house of this period and status			2
’ the document quotes from a pre-application statement prepared by @entity61 which states : ‘ the reinstatement of appropriately detailed skirting and cornicing is welcomed in listed building terms			2
i would encourage you to remove all modern lowered ceilings as part of your application			0
’ @entity8 waves to well - wishers from her @entity15 home after leaving hospital in 2010 builders are set to spend the next 18 months giving the @entity22 listed townhouse a traditional makeover , following its sale to @entity23 last year plans , approved last month by @entity61 , aim to ‘ retain the key historic elements of the internal spaces that remain and / or adapt them sympathetically to the new domestic layout			1
‘ in addition potential opportunities have been identified to reinstate or enhance features of the former interiors where appropriate , as part of the application scheme			0
’ renovations include : installing a porch to match the rest of the terrace , remodelling the rear closet wing to improve its appearance , replacing the modern roof with a mansard one that matches the other terraces , creating a more ‘ traditionally designed ’ mews building , removing modern partitions between rooms and modern doors and removing elements of the ‘ unsympathetic modern interior scheme ’			2
a lift will also be installed in the rear closet extension and a lower ground floor extension and first floor extension with terrace above will be created under the mews building			0
plans of the proposed development show that on the lower ground floor , a room marked for ‘ security ’ will be converted into a bedroom with the mews being replaced with a wine store and ‘ media room ’			0
the @entity8 ' library on the ground floor will become a ‘ snug ’ while bedrooms , dressing rooms and en suite bathrooms on upper floors will be altered			0
hands on : then prime minister @entity8 painting her @entity15 home in 1984 @entity8 also helped her daughter @entity181 decorate her flat in 1984 ( pictured ) @entity183 , one of the directors of the @entity15 - based property company , said : ‘ we 're aiming to create a traditional family home , with renovation work that will keep and enhance its period features			1

‘ we 're bound by strict confidentiality agreements which means we can not discuss facts and figures , but the house is expected to be completed within 18 months			0
’ site manager @entity197 , who has been working on the site for a couple of weeks , described the house as ‘ unspectacular ’			2
he said : ‘ there 's nothing particularly exciting about it , it ’s just a house			0
i 've worked on lots of properties in this area and many are much grander than this			0
‘ when i heard i would be working on it i thought the house would be much grander than it is , which is the surprising thing			0
plans , approved last month by @entity61 , aim to ' retain the key historic elements of the internal spaces that remain and / or adapt them sympathetically to the new domestic layout ' @entity183 , one of the directors of the @entity15 - based property company , said : ' we 're aiming to create a traditional family home , with renovation work that will keep and enhance its period features ' ‘ there are white walls throughout and the rooms are 90 per cent carpeted with just a bit of marble in the entrance hall			1
‘ the most special thing about this house is the person that lived here , not the house itself			0
’ mr @entity183 said he expected the house would be bought by a @entity50 family			2
he added : ‘ it 's a very traditional area with many @entity238 families , as well as some people from ethnic minorities			2
