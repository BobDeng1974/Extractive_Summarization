by @entity0 @entity1 said said militant @entity3 ideology had created an enemy that was ' insidious and venomous , but also difficult to beat ' @entity1 has said religion needs to be put ' in its proper place in politics ' in order to defeat terrorists who ' fight without hesitation , kill without mercy and die without regret '			1
speaking from outside the @entity14 ' headquarters in @entity15 , the former prime minister and current envoy to the @entity18 said @entity3 ideology had created an enemy that was ' insidious and venomous , but also difficult to beat '			1
and he called for the ' basic long - term problem of extremism based on a perversion of religion ' to be confronted following the @entity27 massacre in @entity28 , deadly attacks on @entity30 in @entity31 and the conflagrations in the @entity18			2
he told @entity33 : ' we need to realise that unless we are educating people to a tolerant and respectful and open - minded approach to the world , then this cancer of terrorist groups will continue			2
' the thing about these people is that they fight without hesitation , they kill without mercy and they die without regret			0
' asked if he had hoped for an end to @entity47 after the death of @entity49 , he said : ' no because it does n't put an end to the ideology			0
' i think it 's right that it happened and it will have had a certain impact and it shows that if you organise these terrorist attacks in the end the long arm of the law will ultimately come out and get you			0
' but this is a vibrant ideology that stretches quite deep , i 'm afraid , in certain countries			0
' if you look at the @entity18 right now , if you took out this toxic abuse of religion , all these situations would be easier to deal with			0
' one of the things i work on now and i am very passionate about is the need to put religion in its proper place in politics and also to encourage people who are religious to be tolerant and respectful of those who have a different faith from theirs			1
the former @entity80 prime minister said terrorist groups such as the @entity82 will eventually fall foul of justice ' this is deep and this ideology is being pushed out from the @entity18 but elsewhere now , right across the world , and we are a long way from beating it i 'm afraid			0
' mr @entity1 was speaking after it was announced that @entity80 , the @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 may be edging closer to a @entity97 resolution designed to rid @entity98 of its chemical weapons			1
he welcomed the possibility of an agreement on chemical weapons without the need for military intervention , but warned that a ' threat of firm action from the @entity107 ' to bring the fighting in @entity98 to an end would still be needed			1
@entity1 warned that a ' threat of firm action from the @entity107 ' was needed to end the crisis in @entity98 ' unless we do that @entity98 , will continue disintegrating and the implications for the region are huge and the implications for us are huge as well by the way , ' he said			1
the was a risk that the country could be effectively partitioned with president @entity121 and minority groups on one side and an ' extremist - dominated eastern hinterland '			0
' that would be a disaster for everyone , ' he said			0
finally asked about revelations that @entity130 's former spin doctor @entity129 had briefed against members of his own party , mr @entity1 declined to comment			1
' here in the @entity14 it all seems a long , long time ago and a long way away , ' he said .			2

former *pm* called extreme @entity3 ideology ' insidious and venomous '
he said those with religious faith must be more tolerant of others
@entity1 also spoke of @entity98 fears as he visits @entity14
