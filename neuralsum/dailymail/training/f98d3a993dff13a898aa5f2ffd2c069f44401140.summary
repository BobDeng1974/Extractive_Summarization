the figurines , which include two - headed humans , crocodile ( pictured ) and man on horseback			1
the precious clay figurines were excavated by archaeologists from the universities of @entity4 and @entity32 and the @entity33 ( @entity33 )			1
they have just gone on show at the @entity36 - the first time they will be seen publicly outside @entity4			2
the team of experts believe the figurines were used to invoke the help of ancestors to cure illnesses			1
using computed tomography scanning techniques at the @entity32 , the experts revealed hidden channels within the objects			1
they believe these channels had a medicinal function and were used for liquid ritual offerings			1
the clay models measure up to 31 centimetres in height and show the costumes and weapons worn and used by the people living in @entity4 at the time			2
the figurine on the left shows that the people used animals to travel long distances , while on the right is a @entity65 - like model with two ' human ' heads professor @entity67 from the @entity32 , told @entity68 : ' the figurines seem to have been offered libations - perhaps of blood or beer - and perhaps had sacrifices made to them			1
' they might have been used to make herbal medicines more powerful , which might then have been drunk or applied to the body			0
it is still relatively early in the research so we can not say for certain			0
' the figurines show people with congenital conditions including anencephaly ( the absence of a major portion of the brain , skull and scalp that occurs during embryonic development , ) which still affects children in @entity91 today - while others show clothes and symbolic animals that had symbolic roles			2
some figurines in the collection were also possibly ‘ scapegoats ’ and were intended as the focus or recipient of disease and misfortune rather than their human keepers			0
the figures have been dated to between the 6th and the 14th centuries			0
' the representations of the people in the figurines suggests that both men and women used them - but not children perhaps - as they are very rarely represented and might not have had the ritual status and maturity to use them , ' professor @entity67 told @entity68			2

professor @entity67 said the figurines seem to have been offered libations - perhaps of blood or beer - and perhaps had sacrifices made to them further analysis by the team , led by professor @entity124 and involving professor @entity67 , will show what liquid ritual offerings were actually used			1
the figurines were found in a village called @entity129 in @entity130 in the north of @entity4 and come from two mounds thought to be used as a shrine by the makers of the objects			1
while the models are thought to have been relatively common , ' the way they were deposited suggests they were thought of as spiritually valuable , perhaps as ancestors , ' said professor @entity67			2
because the figurines are highly sought after in the art market , some mounds in the region have been illegally excavated but professor @entity144 told @entity68 there could possibly be as many as several thousand mounds to discover , that could hold similar treasures			2
the mounds have been added to the @entity149 , a register of archaeological material at risk			0
professor @entity124 said : ' these figurines are unique to the region and offer an insight into aspects of past human beliefs , ways of understanding and creativity			0
' this has not always been possible , where there is no tradition of making representations , or when they simply have not survived			0
the experts think both men and women used the figurines - but not children - as they are very rarely represented and might not have had the ritual status and maturity to use them			1
the figurine on the left shows a seated woman , while the one on the right is a type of lid with what is thought to be a @entity65 figure on top the team of experts believe the figurines were used to invoke the help of ancestors to cure illnesseshidden channels within the objects			1
the models include channels used for a medicinal function that were used for liquid ritual offerings to find out what the offerings were , it is thought the liquid could have been blood or beer			1
they could have been used to make herbal medicines more powerful , which might then have been drunk or applied to the body			0
the figurines might also have had sacrifices made to them			0
some figurines in the collection were also possibly ‘ scapegoats ’ and were intended as the focus or recipient of disease and misfortune rather than their human keepers , according to the experts			0
' their exquisite and consistent appearance obviously required a great deal of skill , suggesting those who made them were a specialist occupation			0
' professor @entity67 said that little is known about the people who made the figurines and they are not thought to have any connection with @entity228 's current inhabitants			0
' in fact , we know little in general about the past in this part of @entity4 , because there are few historical sources before the late 19th century and oral traditions are scarce , ' he said			0
' but archaeology is unlocking some of the secrets of the past , and this project shows what can be achieved			0
' we now know the figurines may have had ritual and medicinal functions and the mounds they were found in were perhaps medicine shrines , or places for disposal of material considered dangerous if disposed of correctly			2
' we also know these people were farmers , who traded with cowry shells , used iron tools and lived in villages , with complex religious beliefs ' by examining the figurines , the archaeologists , including professor @entity67 who is pictured left , now know the models have had ritual and medicinal functions and the mounds they were found in were perhaps medicine shrines , or places for disposal of material considered dangerous he also said that the horse or camel figurine indicates awareness that animals could be used by people for long distance travel			1
speaking about the illegal trade of the ancient figures , professor @entity124 said : ' the people of the villages of @entity228 have a keen sense of the figurines as part of their heritage and deeply resent the unethical trade in such material			0
' professor @entity67 said : ' the people of the villages of @entity228 in @entity4 are involved in the fieldwork ( to collect figurines ) and have a keen sense of the figurines as part of their heritage			2
' so we are proud that this exhibition actively involves @entity4 archaeologists and museum curators who are coming to @entity32 to support it , ' he said			1
the exhibition is currently open and runs until may 5 , 2014 .			0
