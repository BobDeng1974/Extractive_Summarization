from looking as if a door had been slammed shut on them , @entity1 , unexpectedly , have a chance to kick it back open and capitalise			1
when @entity1 ’s players trudged from the @entity8 pitch , having been pummelled into submission by @entity10 , all hope of a top - four finish looked to have evaporated			2
@entity13 , subdued and disconsolate , admitted as much in his post-match debrief			2
the @entity13 who left @entity15 nine days ago is very different , though , to the @entity13 who will step into @entity17 ’s technical area on monday , feeling optimistic and satisfied with his lot			1
he knows @entity1 have been let off the hook and now he wants to see a response			2
@entity1 's first - team players will be all smiles if they can finish inside the top four and win the @entity24 @entity1 winger @entity25 arrives at @entity17 eight hours ahead of monday night 's match at @entity17 @entity27 will be hoping to keep his place after appearing in @entity1 's win over @entity30 @entity31 removes a suit from the boot of his car as he begins to prepare for his side 's league match @entity1 are seven points behind fourth - placed @entity38 but have a game in hand on their rivals had @entity38 won their games against @entity43 and @entity44 , talk of @entity1 being @entity46 contenders would have been risible but the implosion at the @entity48 has thrown things wide open			1
at present , the gap between @entity1 and @entity38 is seven points – and , just like last year when the two teams were duelling , @entity51 ’s side have a significantly better goal difference – but @entity13 will be telling his squad that it is not insurmountable			1
given the way @entity38 are playing , there are a number of games that could cause them issues on the climb to the line – will @entity65 and @entity66 be straightforward ? how about @entity67 away ? does @entity51 retain his squad ’s belief ? – and now is the moment @entity1 must pounce			1
in the next seven days , the way @entity1 ’s campaign is viewed could be completely transformed			2
beat @entity73 and they will believe they can hunt @entity38 down ; see off @entity65 at @entity74 and they will have a fine chance of winning the @entity24			1
@entity76 , pictured making his way into @entity17 , has failed to hit the back of the net in his last six games @entity81 boss @entity13 will be hoping his side can get back to winning ways in the @entity84 @entity25 and his @entity1 team - mates were left dejected after their 4 - 1 defeat by @entity10 so now the question will be asked of @entity13 ’ squad : can they ramp up the pressure ? there have been occasions this season when they have faltered at crucial moments – think home games against @entity96 ( @entity46 ) , @entity44 ( @entity84 ) – and there can be no repeat			1
here lies an opportunity for @entity25 to dispel the furore around his contract saga with some jet - propelled performances , for @entity103 to remind a wider audience of his goalscoring ability and for @entity106 to sparkle and shine			0
@entity106 has won @entity109 ’s vote to be the player of the year			0
it was quite a statement from the @entity113 captain but there is little doubt that the @entity116 has the ability to be one of the top draws in the @entity84			0
these two games should be made for him			0
if @entity106 starts pulling the strings against @entity73 , @entity1 will get the result that will ensure @entity38 feel their breath on their necks and you would think the wide open spaces of @entity74 would be tailor - made for his passing game			1
@entity1 playmaker @entity106 helped his side progress to the semi-finals of the @entity24 @entity13 talks tactics with his coaching staff ahead of his side 's @entity84 showdown with @entity73 ‘ he is a young player that 's come into this country and adapted incredibly well to the style of football in the @entity84 , ’ said @entity13			1
‘ people initially maybe thought he might be a bit slight			0
but he is very strong in his mind and he ’s got an incredible technique , up there with world 's best			0
' with him it 's about the consistency			0
he played in a different position the other night against @entity30 , we asked him tactically to operate different and he carried that out very , very well			1
so great tactical discipline and obviously a wonderful goal			0
‘ his best years are way ahead of him			0
he 's such a humble boy , he wants to train and loves his football every day			0
@entity109 's probably looking at his performance level ; since he 's been here it has been outstanding and is only going to get better which is the pleasing thing for everyone			0
’ @entity13 ’ ambition all year has been to win a trophy			1
if he was also to steer @entity1 into a top - four spot , it would arguably represent an even better campaign than last year when they came within two points of ending their 25 - year quest to become champions of @entity166			2
to realise that ambition , however , @entity13 needs two wins			2
a door has been left ajar and @entity106 is the man to lead @entity1 through it .			0

@entity1 got back to winning ways with @entity24 *victory* over @entity30
@entity13 will be hoping his side can close gap on @entity38
the @entity81 are just seven points behind @entity38 with a game in hand
@entity1 host @entity73 at @entity17 on monday night
