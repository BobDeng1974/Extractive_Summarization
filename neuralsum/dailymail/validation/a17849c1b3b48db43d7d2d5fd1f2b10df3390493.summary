@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of football including @entity6 's return and @entity7 being a rock at the back for @entity10			1
@entity7 reminded @entity10 how badly they had missed him during their awful exit from the @entity12 in midweek			1
the 20 - year - old , left out by @entity14 in @entity15 who picked @entity17 instead , returned to the starting line - up with a strong defensive display at @entity20			1
stones and @entity22 made 41 clearances between them to limit @entity24 to just one shot on target			1
@entity10 have lost just three of the 12 games the pair have played as centre backs since @entity21 recovered from injury			1
@entity7 was impressive for @entity10 in their win over @entity20 on sunday 2			1
@entity33 boss @entity32 seems to rate @entity34 far higher than @entity35 does			1
the winger got dragged off by his @entity38 boss after just 58 minutes of the 4 - 3 win over @entity40 – meaning he ’s been hooked early in all the last eight matches he has started for his club			1
of 32 appearances in a @entity38 shirt this season he ’s only completed 90 minutes on seven occasions			2
despite that @entity32 picked him in november – although he was forced to withdraw through injury – and has him in the squad for this week ’s fixtures against @entity49 and @entity50			2
@entity51 was substituted in the 38th minute against @entity40 by @entity35 3			1
if @entity53 do finish the season being relegated back to the @entity55 it wo n’t be through lack of effort			2
the @entity59 performance data shows they collectively ran two miles more than @entity62 ’s side as they fought to avoid the 2 - 0 defeat at @entity65 ’s – 73.8 miles compared to @entity62 ’ 71.8			1
it ’s nothing new – @entity68 ’s side have outworked their opponents in every single one of their 30 @entity71 fixtures so far			2
@entity72 and the rest of the @entity53 side outworked @entity62 in their defeat on saturday 4			2
@entity77 ’s ability to find bargain signings continues to be the envy of many other clubs – and the £ 3million they paid @entity62 for @entity82 looks the latest astute investment			0
the 25 - year - old son of former @entity86 star @entity85 has slotted straight into @entity88 ’s midfield with seven 90 minute appearances in a row and was excellent at @entity91			0
he covered more ground ( 7.1miles ) , played more passes ( 72 ) , fought in more duels ( 21 ) and won more tackles ( 5 ) than any other player on the pitch			0
@entity82 has slotted in well to @entity77 's midfield since his move from @entity62 in january 5			0
@entity100 needs to help @entity101 rediscover the form that rescued the club a year ago as a priority for this season ’s fight against relegation			0
the new @entity109 boss picked the 21 - year - old at @entity111 for his first 90 minute appearance since january 1st			0
@entity101 , who scored five goals in the final six games last term , had just one shot on target and one wayward at @entity119 – and has scored only three @entity12 games all season			2
@entity101 needs to rediscover his form of last season to help @entity109 avoid the drop 6			0
@entity6 ’s return to fitness has come at the perfect time for @entity128 as they try to chase down @entity130 for the runners - up spot			0
the @entity133 international midfielder took full advantage of the space given him by @entity137 as the @entity138 went into a two goal lead			0
@entity6 , whose late appearance off the bench almost helped rescue @entity128 ’s @entity143 fortunes in @entity144 , played more accurate passes in the attacking half of the field than any of his team mates			0
@entity6 's return to form for @entity128 has come at just the right time as they push for a top four place 7			0
@entity153 look a more effective side when they pass the ball rather than lump it up to @entity156			1
@entity158 ’s side played 568 passes in the 2 - 1 win at @entity161 , some 162 more than @entity162			2
it was also only 27 less than their best away total of the season so far , when they ran rings round relegation candidates @entity20 at @entity169 in january			1
@entity153 have looked a better side since they started passing the ball more 8			1
@entity172 has set about restoring his reputation as one of the game ’s bright young coaches since @entity177 appointed him as number two to @entity179			0
the 42 - year - old , whose cv included taking @entity182 into @entity183 as a manager then helping @entity185 keep @entity186 in the @entity71 , had spent nearly a year out of the game before getting the chance in @entity189			0
@entity177 had just one win in 11 games before he arrived – but the 2 - 0 success against @entity193 makes it four wins and 15 points in all from nine games since then			2
@entity172 is doing a good job as coach at @entity177 working with @entity179 9			0
@entity200 and former @entity153 midfielder @entity201 is being talked about in fees of up to £ 100million – but @entity204 boss @entity203 picked up his brother @entity205 from the @entity207 giants on a free transfer			1
the 6ft 3ins striker has proved an inspired signing , even if he is yet to get his first goal			0
his physical presence has helped make space for @entity214 to get seven in ten games since @entity201 , 24 , made his debut at the start of february , with @entity204 collecting 16 points in the process			1
@entity201 is being talked about as a £ 100m player - but his brother @entity205 signed for @entity204 for free 10			0
@entity221 has suffered a major setback to what looked like a promising career as a manager at @entity226 after he was sacked on monday			0
the former @entity20 ace lifted the club to third in the @entity183 table in october – but since then has overseen a slump that has seen them crash to just one place off the relegation zone following a 4 - 1 thrashing at @entity236			1
@entity221 was unable to keep a settled side – @entity238 have used 46 players in @entity12 games this season			1
@entity221 was sacked by @entity226 on monday morning			0

@entity7 and @entity22 made 41 clearances against @entity20
@entity34 has been substituted early in his last eight games
@entity153 are a better side when they pass the ball
