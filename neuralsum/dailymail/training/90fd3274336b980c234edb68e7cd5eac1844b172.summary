by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 10:22 est , 22 december 2013 @entity3 : 08:44 est , 23 december 2013 while most soldiers in @entity7 will spend @entity8 missing their loved ones , one mother and son will be spending it just a stone 's throw from each other in @entity14			1
lance corporal @entity15 , 40 , and son @entity16 , who is a private , are not only both serving the same tour in @entity7 , but work in the same logistics squadron in @entity20			1
to make matters worse for @entity23 , who turns 23 today , his mother was recently promoted so now outranks him			2
family : lance corporal @entity15 , 40 , with her son private @entity25 , 23 , in @entity20 the pair , from @entity27 , do not work together on a day - to - day basis but are both members of the @entity30 , which is part of the @entity32 based at @entity20			1
and despite working at different parts of the huge camp - the @entity38 's main base in @entity7 - the mother and son will get to wish each other a @entity8 in person			1
reservist @entity41 , who works for @entity44 , joined the @entity45 two - and - a - half years ago , while her son @entity16 has been a member of the regular army for five years			1
and they are hoping to meet up , at least briefly , on wednesday , as all troops in @entity7 take part in @entity8 celebrations			1
another bonus for @entity53 is a birthday surprise from his mother , who is delivering a banner , balloons and a birthday cake to him today			2
boss : unfortunately for @entity23 , his mother outranks him and can discipline him at home and at work fighting family : private @entity15 was first to join the army while his mother signed up to the @entity45 two years ago ' i have got a happy birthday banner , birthday balloons and - if his brother has sent it out on time - a birthday cake , ' she said			1
' he 's going to kill me , but that 's what mothers are for ! ' the treat is likely to embarrass the soldier , who is teased for the fact his mother is in the same squadron , even more than usual			2
@entity53 , who served in a previous tour in @entity7 , said his reaction when his mother first told him she was joining up was : ' is this a joke ? ' the 23 - year - old , who distributes equipment to units in @entity20 , added : ' i get a bit of stick but everyone is used to it now - i thought i 'd get a bit more stick than i got			1
his mother , whose job is issuing and bringing ammunition back in to @entity20 , said she had wanted to join the forces when she was younger but was not allowed , so when she saw an advertisement for reservists , decided to join up			2
' my gran was chuffed for me , so was my grandad			0
my dad just thought it was a phase i was going through , my two boys just thought i was mad			0
' dangerous : the mother and son are based in the @entity38 's @entity20 in @entity7 's @entity14 @entity103 , who has not served in @entity7 before but worked at last year 's @entity104 as part of her work with the @entity45 said it was nice to be able to see her son fairly regularly			1
' we meet up in the evenings and have a coffee			0
i still end up buying the @entity114 though			0
' unusual though the arrangement is			0
captain @entity116 , second - in - command of the squadron , said it is n't the first time they had seen relatives working together , but it was his first experience in @entity7			0
the 31 - year - old , from @entity125 , said : ' we 've had it before domestically - in the @entity38 we had a husband and wife in the same squadron , but this is my first experience of it in theatre			0
' it 's just about being aware of it			0
i knew with @entity16 and @entity15 it was more that @entity16 was concerned that the guys would give him stick for it			1
' they are in the same squadron , they do similar jobs , but in completely different parts of @entity20			2
i 'm led to believe there 's frequent meet - ups though			0
' he added : ' i think he is a bit more worried now because she can subject him to military discipline as well as domestic discipline			0

lance corporal @entity15 , 40 , joined the @entity45 two years ago
@entity16 , 23 , is regular army but both are in the @entity30
