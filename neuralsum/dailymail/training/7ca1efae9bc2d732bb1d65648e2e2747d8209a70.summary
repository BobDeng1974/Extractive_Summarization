among them were two football fans who had travelled from @entity36 to see their beloved @entity38 play , only to be caught urinating in an alleyway across from the city 's @entity40			2
the men , aged 22 and 27 , were on the way to the @entity45 complex of bars and restaurants , and said they simply could n’t wait to use a toilet			2
shamed : these two men were spotted by the police patrol , dubbed ' @entity33 ' urinating against walls near to @entity40 , @entity9 tough choice : those caught relieving themselves by the police patrol are handed a letter before being given the option of cleaning up their mess or having to pay a fine one , who works as an engineer in @entity36 , said : ' i ’ve had about 20 pints today so i was bursting			1
i thought it would be easiest just to nip down here , all guys do it			2
' however , @entity69 , @entity70 councillor for the city centre , who accompanied police on the patrol , was not impressed by the excuses			1
she said : ' not all guys do it			0
many men will plan ahead so there is no need to urinate in the street , and you do n’t see so many girls urinating in public			0
somehow they manage to wait			0
' residents and business owners should n’t have to live with the smell and sight of urine			0
' it ’s unhygienic and unfair that they have to clean up other peoples ’ mess			2

' if i ’m being honest i ’d do this again if i did n’t think the police were watching			0
although i would n’t ever do it outside someone ’s house as that ’s not fair			0
