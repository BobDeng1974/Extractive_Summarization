at the school my two eldest children go to they have a unique form of parental torture surely invented purely to make my life a misery once a year			2
‘ @entity8 ’ : these two words do not belong together do they ? like ‘ sugar ’ and ‘ free ’ or ‘ drink ’ and ‘ moderation ’ they should never be in the same sentence			1
so , what , exactly is ‘ @entity8 ’ ? well , it ’s just like normal homework — only worse			1
@entity17 has recently come into contact with ' @entity8 ' which has seen her attempt various dubious tasks including knitting in order to encourage her daughter 's creative thinking it ’s the kind of homework the tyrannical teacher from @entity29 would set ; miss @entity31 homework			1
the idea behind @entity8 is to encourage creative free - thinking in a young mind ( a dangerous concept to start with for my rebellious pre-teen girls )			1
what happens is a subject is given and you can do whatever you want with it : build a sculpture , write an essay , set it to music , turn it into performance art , make an omelette ; anything as long as you can explain the mental acrobatics which helped you come up with your idea in the first place			1
@entity17 says that working full - time and open homework does not mix past themes of this annual working - mum - stress - increaser have included ‘ flight ’ and ‘ black and white ’			1
i marvel at some of the pupils ’ resulting creations , really i do			2
even though parents are forbidden from helping , some of the work is so magnificent it looks like it has been handed in by architect @entity66 or crafted by professor @entity67			2
ours , however , tend to end up looking like they ’ve been made in the craft room at a lunatic asylum by an inmate with questionable motor skills			2
this is because i really do try not to help , despite @entity8 sucking up most of my evenings and once waking me up in the middle of the night with a nightmare about the toddler getting hold of the wood glue and sticking a rug to the floor			1
this project throws me into a week - long sunday - night - gloom , looming large in the lengthy daily to - do list because my children enthusiastically throw everything they have got at it			1
when i suggest a little editing of their ideas , some focus perhaps , or possibly a less ambitious ‘ build ’ , as @entity91 would say , i am shushed			0
i am sent out with a shopping list that once included ‘ something that looks like a bug ’s eye ’			0
we ’ve made board games , built aeroplanes and once @entity99 asked me to construct a life - size model of a @entity102 cow			1
even @entity103 could n’t do that , i say , but she replies : ‘ maybe we could knit one and stuff it			0
’ in a busy household of four children aged three to 12 , this kind of project takes over			0
bits of the different creations are to be found drying / setting / cooking everywhere			0
on sunday i heard @entity99 describing @entity8 to her grandma on the phone : ‘ it ’s this fun thing we do that @entity118 hates , ’ she said			1
‘ mum sort of comes up with an idea and then we do it for her			2
’ i feel the meaning of the mission has been lost			0
this year we have the number ‘ 100 ’ as the theme — no doubt inspired by the centenary of the war			0
of course @entity99 does not want to do something so obvious as this anniversary			0
‘ @entity132 mum , everyone will do that , ’ she says			0
and so begins the fraught discussion of ideas			0
she will have ten , develop five into an embryonic project for which all manner of empty jam jars , egg boxes , candles and silver paint will be required			0
by day three of @entity8 i will feel like lying down in the @entity142 clutching a sign saying ‘ do not resuscitate ’ as she narrows down her choice to one idea			1
the girls approach this with far more enthusiasm than any other homework			2
perhaps because of my antipathy they love it as much as i fear it			0
maybe if i did n’t work i would have more time and enjoy taking part ? maybe not			0
i find normal homework , especially maths , gruelling but this no - rules homework pains me more			1
and we never have enough glue			0
we have now come up with an idea after hours of discussion			2
does anyone know where i can get something that looks like a small marsupial ? @entity166 is editor in chief of @entity168 .			1
