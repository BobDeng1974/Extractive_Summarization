i ’ve never been so angry watching a game as a neutral			0
my initial shock and fascination at what was unfolding soon turned to disgust at half - time			2
it was n’t just @entity8 ’s lack of defensive ability , their lack of interest in defending was a disgrace			1
as a player i have had bad games and suffered heavy losses ( never 7 — 1 though ! ) and walked away wishing the outcome had been different			1
but from 2 - 0 down the lack of leadership and character was something i do n’t think i ’ve ever seen at the top level			1
he was trying to be clever with a step - over , followed by a blind pass			2
@entity26 broke , he scampered back and conceded the corner and was then apologising			2
i ’m still astonished that @entity51 ’s @entity50 is not in the squad never mind the team as i did n’t see a better left back in @entity54 last season — or in this competition to date			1
the corner for the first goal was a well - worked routine from the @entity59 with @entity25 losing @entity31 , who was blocked off			1
you perhaps can excuse him for that one			0
but how can anyone try to explain the overall defensive performance of the @entity64 captain ? i have never been a fan , then warmed to him in this tournament , but … that was as bad a central defensive performance as i ’ve seen from someone at this level			0
record breaker : @entity71 celebrates after becoming the top scorer in @entity74 history with 16 lethal : @entity8 midfielder @entity75 watches on , as their defenders did all night , while @entity71 slots home partners : @entity8 , whose team bus has the slogan ' @entity85 yourselves ! the sixth is coming ! ' , were humiliated in my preview to the game , i mentioned his leadership qualities : rallying the crowd , taking a penalty , consoling players after they ’d missed theirs			1
that ’s the easier bit of leadership			0
the difficult part is on the pitch : organising the players around you , cajoling your team - mates , making people around you perform better , setting an example in times of trouble			2
he did n’t do that			0
instead he allowed @entity8 to sink			2
he was running all over the pitch , failing to hold his position			0
then went for the oldest trick in the book , trying to hurt @entity59 players to show the crowd how determined he was			2
he caught @entity71 with an elbow twice , then took a wild swing at @entity25 in the second half — that was embarrassing			0
certain centre backs are leaders , while others need to be led			0
after this game , it is obvious what category he is in ! he shoots , he scores : @entity26 midfielder @entity125 nets his side 's third past after more poor defending watching the first half , as @entity26 raced into a 5 - 0 lead , took me back to how people must have reacted when watching @entity133 ’s first half against @entity134 in @entity135 , where it actually becomes painful to watch			1
the half - time whistle reminded me of the dressing room that night — but we were only 3 - 0 down ! our dressing room then was in a state of shock , heads bowed with embarrassment			1
but that night in @entity135 we somehow rallied each other			0
then , in the second half , with a combination of determination and some tactical changes , we got ourselves back into the game			0
to be fair , @entity22 made changes and @entity8 should have scored a couple before @entity26 made it 6 - 0			1
@entity125 - ing to victory : @entity153 and @entity154 can do little more than look at each other after the fourth goal easy does it : @entity159 slots the ball home to give @entity26 into a 5 - 0 lead on 29 minutes opposites : @entity26 celebrate but @entity31 is unable to lift his teammates as the scoreline worsens the @entity59 must take huge credit for their work - rate and intelligence			1
more importantly , their composure in a semi-final of a @entity74 was remarkable			0
they scored three goals , from @entity71 , @entity125 and @entity159 , as if playing a training game , passing the ball around the penalty box			0
the goals and intelligence of @entity25 , the strings being pulled by @entity125 on his 50th cap — and both are only 24 — were impressive , but we should also mention the beautifully - timed tackles and assists of @entity183 , who is the best full back in the game , and the imposing features in goals of the outstanding @entity187			2
people have said the only thing missing from this tournament is an outstanding team , but i think we ’ve seen one now			0
no way back : @entity194 and @entity195 stand in the centre circle - something they did all too frequently on tuesday night too little , too late : @entity194 scored a consolation for the host nation in the dying minutes but it was pointless do n’t forget they beat @entity202 ’s @entity203 4 - 0 in the first game and this team have a strong influence from @entity207 similar to the one @entity208 had on the @entity210 team over the last few years			1
@entity207 have won eight trophies in the past two years and @entity26 now look odds on to add an international trophy to that domestic haul			0
the 1 - 7 result will be remembered a lot longer in @entity8 than in @entity26			1
the 1950 @entity8 team were always reminded of their defeat by @entity219 in the final and they only lost 2 - 1 ! this result has shocked the world .			1

hosts beaten 7 - 1 by *clinical* @entity59
the lack of leadership after it went to 2 - 0 was shocking
@entity8 players will never forget this defeat , their worst ever
@entity44 and @entity31 were the worst of a bad bunch
@entity51 full - back @entity50 should have been in the squad
