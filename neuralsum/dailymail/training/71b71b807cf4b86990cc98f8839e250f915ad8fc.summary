by @entity0 she may be the toast of the fashion world but according to public opinion even @entity3 is guilty of making fashion faux pas			1
a new survey , which polled 1,000 brits about age appropriate fashion and behaviour , found that very steep high heels loved by celebrities such as mrs @entity3 , should not be worn by anyone over the age of 32			1
at 40 , @entity3 is well over the cut off			1
and have you been worried you are too old for a tattoo ? according to the survey , which polled 500 men and 500 women between the ages of 18 and 70 , if you 've turned 31 , your chance is over			0
someone better tell 68 - year - old @entity23 , who brandishes an inking on her hand			0
so if you do n’t want to end up branded on social media as # @entity27 or secretly snapped and posted under # menwithponytails , read on			0
right : @entity31 , who recently turned 50 , gets it oh - so wrong by wearing a cap 18 years over the survey 's cut off the worst offences include : wearing a baseball cap if you are older than 32 , men growing a goatee beard if they are older than 32 and women older than 48 wearing a bikini			1
lots of people like to recapture their youth in middle - age but if you do n’t want to make your children cringe , maybe it is worth sticking to the most popular age limits in the survey by diet company @entity51			1
having a tattoo is a great sign of teenage rebellion - and even the prime minister ’s wife @entity55 has a small dolphin on her ankle			0
but most of us reckon that it is embarrassing to show off a new etching after the age of 31			2
and it 's not just in the wardrobe department where you have to tread carefully			0
routinely ending emails or texts with a kiss ( @entity70 ) to strangers is also deemed embarrassing after the age of 29			1
emails and texting are another minefield of age - related etiquette			2
@entity77 is a very dishy ' embarrassment ' sporting a goatee when he 's over a decade above the cut off ; right : @entity23 's tattoo is also deemed inappropriate by the survey prime minister @entity83 famously wrongly used the text short - form ' lol ' - thinking it meant lots of @entity86 and not the correct @entity87			1
but is it any wonder ? after all , at 47 , @entity83 is 18 years too old for this kind of texting - which should stop at 29 according to the survey			2
similarly , however happy , sad , surprised or amazed you 're feeling , no one should use emoticons in their texts over the age of 26			2
another politician to get it wrong was foreign secretary @entity99 , who was ridiculed for wearing a baseball cap when he was aged 36			2
he was four years over the cut off point , which the survey pinpointed at 32			1
@entity31 , is also a big fan of the headgear , even though she 's wildly over the age limit having just turned 50			0
wearing a baseball cap back - to - front is even more age prohibitive with a cut off of 25			1
listening to @entity108 is an essential part of most children ’s upbringing - but any adult doing it beyond the age of 29 should think about switching to @entity114			2
millions of women will be wearing a bikini on the beach this summer - but according to the survey women over the age of 48 should only sport all - in - ones			1
if you 're @entity123 , however , you might just about get away with it , despite missing the cut off by a decade			2
crop tops , meanwhile , have an age restriction of 28 and below			0
there are lots of ways that men try to turn back the clock			0
growing a goatee , as 50 - year - old @entity77 often does , is not advised after the age of 34			1
@entity135 has regularly worn his hair in a ponytail , but the survey found men should n’t have one after the age of 29			1
luckily though , @entity135 has one more year to attend music festivals without becoming an embarrassment			0
the cut off point for going to festivals like @entity144 is the oldest in the survey at 41 , reflecting the increasing numbers of middle - aged revelers who attend			1
the survey has other suggestions about what 's age appropriate in our free time			2
@entity155 is fun when you are young but you should switch to skiing at 36 if you do n’t want to be naff			0
anyone enjoying reality tv like @entity161 is @entity162 or @entity163 beyond the age of 31 is also deemed an embarrassment			0
and when it comes to reality tv voting on programmes like the x-factor the cut off is a mere 26 - years - old			0
the youngest cut off point revealed in the survey is for kissing in the street , which should be avoided beyond 25			1
other behaviour to be given an age warning included riding a skateboard ( cut off point 26 ) and wearing a replica football shirt ( 37 )			1
@entity51 managing director @entity180 said : ' we are all trying to slow down the ageing process , and it is fun to recapture our youth by revisiting the hobbies and fashions of our teens			0
' a cut off point of 48 for wearing bikinis does seem very harsh			1
women in their 50s and 60s who have stayed in shape can look fantastic in the right bikini			0
' @entity195 sees a 30 per cent surge in sales between may and july as million of women get ready for the beach			0
a decade too late : 58 - year - old @entity123 sporting a bikini			0

the survey questioned 1,000 brits about age appropriate fashion and behaviour
very steep high heels loved by celebrities such as @entity3 , should not be worn over the age of 32
baseball caps also should n’t be worn by anyone over 32 and for wearing one back - to - front the cut off point is 25
growing a goatee , as @entity77 often does , is not advised after the age of 34
wearing a bikini over the age of 48 is deemed inappropriate
ending emails or texts with a kiss ( @entity70 ) to people who are n’t family or *friends* is embarrassing if you 're over 29
