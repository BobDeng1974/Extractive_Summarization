by @entity0 published : 08:57 est , 24 september 2012 updated : 08:57 est , 24 september 2012 strolling down the main shopping drag in this working - class @entity4 suburb , it 's not the second - skin dresses in shocking pink spandex that catch the eye or even the strapless tops with strategically placed peekaboo paneling			1
the newest look can instead be found in stores like @entity12 , where the hot items are the demure , long - sleeved frocks with how - low - can - you - go hemlines and the polyester putty - colored potato sack dresses			1
in the birthplace of the ' fio dental ' or dental floss string bikini , so - called evangelical fashion has emerged as a growing segment of the country 's $ 52 billion - a - year textile industry , catering to the conservative sartorial needs of @entity27 's burgeoning numbers of born - again @entity28			1
on trend : dresses made by @entity27 brand @entity31 , which produces @entity33 fashion , on display in a shop window in @entity36 once so difficult to procure that evangelical women tended to make much of their own clothes themselves , the modest garb is now popping up all over @entity27			1
on the tiny high street of @entity44 suburb @entity42 , not one but two evangelical clothing stores compete to dress the faithful			1
@entity47 got its start two decades ago as a conventional clothing shop , selling the short , tight styles favored in this tropical country , but shifted to evangelical offerings five years ago			2
@entity53 , two doors down , opened in march			0
' it used to be that the word ` evangelical ' had a tacky connotation , ' said m&a manager @entity58 , who converted from @entity59 a decade ago			0
' but now , we 're not afraid to show who we are			0
evangelical women now wear this clothing proudly , ' he said , gesturing at the racks of ample dresses , long @entity67 denim skirts and ribbed sweaters that in the 100 - plus degree heat were enough to make you sweat just by looking at them			1
introduced in the mid- 19th century by @entity75 missionaries , @entity27 's @entity73 churches were long regarded as fringe groups			1
aggressive proselytizing , particularly among the poor and disenfranchised , has produced a dramatic spike in the community 's numbers in recent decades and eaten away at @entity27 's status as the world 's largest @entity59 country			1
in 1980 , evangelicals represented just over 6 percent of the population , according to the country 's @entity88 statistics agency			1
in the 2010 census , more than 42 million people , or 22per cent of the country 's 190 million , identified themselves as evangelicals			1
some statisticians predict that if current trends hold , evangelical christians could become the majority here by 2030			0
with the spiraling numbers have come increased visibility and political and economic strength			0
three senators and 63 congressional representatives belong to evangelical churches , and a candidate with links to the @entity107 has a considerable lead in polls ahead of next month 's mayoral race in @entity36 , @entity111 's biggest city			2
the @entity107 also owns one of @entity27 's main television networks , @entity114			1
preserving modesty : women in some @entity33 congregations are expected to cover up at all times , except at home with their husbands still , @entity27 's evangelicals are far from a unified block			1
today hosts of homegrown pentecostal denominations have their own dress codes , which range from draconian to permissive			2
evangelical men are also expected to dress modestly , in long - sleeved shirts and slacks that are more readily available in regular stores			1
women in some congregations wear the archetypal @entity27 outfit , tank tops and short shorts , in their daily lives , donning demure skirts and shoulder - covering tops only for services			1
in others , women are expected to cover up at all times , except at home with their husbands , and do n't even remove their form - concealing robes at the beach			2
pastor @entity143 of the conservative @entity144 of the @entity145 said his church 's strict dress code had its foundations in scripture			1
the church forbids women from wearing pants as well as red and black fabrics and encourages the use of robes			2
' the @entity156 orders women to wear this kind of clothing			0
it says women 's bodies are not meant to be on display for everyone , just for their husbands , ' @entity143 said , adding that adhering to the church 's dress code ' is a way for women to be in communion with @entity170			1
' @entity36 - based label @entity171 makes clothes aimed at moderate evangelicals , who generally cover shoulders and knees and shun women 's pants altogether			1
off limits : the modest garb is now popping up all over @entity27 as women conform to the evangelical church 's strict dress - code in demand : hot fashion items among the evangelical communities include the demure , long - sleeved frocks with how - low - can - you - go hemlines and the polyester putty - colored potato sack dresses launched in 1990 , the label is among the oldest and priciest of the evangelical labels , its garments widely considered the @entity196 of the sector			1
its best - selling below - the - knee denim skirts , the staple piece in most evangelical women 's closets , retail for $ 60 to $ 75 , while the dresses run for about $ 75 to $ 100			1
the label does n't make anything transparent , nor does it make pants			0
commercial director @entity207 said the brand was born of his mother 's constant struggle to find clothes that met the family church 's modesty guidelines			1
' because she has a real entrepreneurial spirit , she decided to regard this problem as a business opportunity , ' he said			0
' she started making things for the ladies at church and then through word of mouth , the ladies from other churches and so on			0
people would come from all over to the really out - of - the - way neighborhood we lived in then			0
' there was so much pent - up demand because until then , practically no one was attending to this public , ' @entity207 said			0
a decade later , the family - run company set up shop in @entity36 's @entity236 garment district as the sole evangelical label			2
' it really shocked people			0
they 'd walk by , do a double - take and say ` what 's that all about ? '' he said			2
now @entity236 is chock - a - block with evangelical brands			0
top accessory : many women wear hats to church services as they attempt to cover up one such newcomer is @entity249 , a 10 - year - old family - run label that was born again five years ago			2
' we sort of stumbled into it by accident after we made a few more sober , conservative pieces , ' said director @entity256 , a @entity59			0
' they sold so well we said , ` hold on , this is interesting			0
' six month later , we decided to radically change our product to cater to evangelical consumers			0
' since then , the label has seen its profits climb by around 30per cent annually , said @entity256			0
the association representing @entity27 's textile sector , @entity264 , does n't keep statistics on growth in niche sectors , but one of the group 's recent publications emphasized that evangelical fashion was ' in real expansion			1
' the tables have turned so completely that now evangelical specialty clothing lines attract scads of nonbelievers			0
@entity58 , the manager of @entity47 in @entity42 , estimates that about 40per cent of the store 's clients are not evangelicals			1
' it 's so hard in regular stores to find clothes that are n't too short or do n't show a lot of cleavage that women who are n't comfortable with showing a lot of skin for whatever reason shop here too , ' he said			2
as a nonpracticing @entity59 , @entity291 converted to an evangelical church two years ago			0
dressed in cutoff shorts and a white tank top with spaghetti straps permitted by her congregation for day - to - day wear , @entity291 said it took her a while to get used to the modest garments required for services			0
' once when i first joined , i went to church in pants , and the pastor called me out on it , ' said the 25 - year - old manicurist and mother of a 7 - year - old daughter			2
' it seemed strange at first , but now i see how what you wear affects other people , not to mention your own sense of self - worth			0
' now , she says she wears only modest , loose - fitting dresses to church			2
' i feel dignified , ' she said .			0
