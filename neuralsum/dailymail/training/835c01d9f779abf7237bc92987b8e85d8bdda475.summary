by @entity0 follow @ @ samcunningham considering @entity2 is on the verge of making history at @entity5 , he is in a remarkably jovial and relaxed mood			1
@entity2 ’s side face @entity8 in the @entity10 play - off final on sunday , when he will attempt to lead the club into the second tier of @entity14 football for the first time in 32 years			1
his four years and 49 days spent in charge of the little east @entity18 club have seen barely any money spent on transfers and make him the fourth - longest serving manager in the @entity22			1
keeping calm : @entity5 boss @entity2 could help his side reach the championship if they can beat @entity8 at @entity26 in the play - off final ‘ stop making me feel old ! ’ @entity2 jokes when this is put to him			1
‘ am i proud ? yeah i ’m proud that i ’ve been at this football club for four years , i ’m proud that i ’ve been able to manage it for four years the way i wanted to do it			2
‘ we ’ve missed out on the play - offs twice , we ’ve finished seventh twice			1
‘ now we hope this is our moment to get out of @entity10 and give this club a little bit of a shot in the arm and have some fun in the championship			2
’ there is something about @entity2 which is infectious			0
even when the pressure is on and he is just moments away from the biggest match of his life , in front of more than 50,000 fans at @entity26 , he keeps breaking out into a huge , genuine smile			0
@entity50 : orient fans celebrate with @entity52 after his goal against @entity54 in the play - off semi-final crucial moment : @entity52 scores the goal which secured @entity5 's place in the @entity10 play - off final we ’re looking out over @entity5 ’s small @entity62 stadium , with room for only 9,271 fans but that number added to by the blocks of new - build flats which punctuate the four corners and overlook the smaller stands			1
it ’s put to @entity2 that getting the club into the @entity40 will boost this tiny @entity73 community and those flats will soar in value			0
he breaks out into an enormous chuckle when he says : ‘ i ’ve got one of them , why do you think i ’m working so hard ? ’ property gag : @entity2 stands in @entity62 and he joked that the flats behind him will boost in value if @entity5 can secure promotion promotion in sight : @entity87 celebrates with @entity5 fans after the play - off semi-final win over @entity54 it is another joke , he actually rents one from his chairman @entity91			1
‘ i ’m doing him another favour , ’ he adds , still laughing			0
‘ i think it ’s great for the community , i really do			0
‘ there was a pop - up pub during the @entity99 , it ’s called the @entity100 now , it ’s come to life a little bit in the years i ’ve been here			0
‘ the @entity103 was great for it and if the football club get into the championship that ’ll be great for it and the rest of the community too			0
’ perhaps @entity2 ’s down - to - @entity109 persona , his appreciation of how his work really impacts on others , comes from his unorthodox route in to football			1
man at the top : @entity5 chairman @entity91 will hope his side can secure promotion to the championship as a player he was a defender , not tall enough at 16 but when he shot up at 18 he had the chance to play for @entity124			2
@entity2 , 53 , instead choose to go to @entity125 to study a four - year degree in physical education			2
when he finished there he went to @entity129 where he got his first job at @entity132 school , but six months in he was already taking time off to coach and play reserve matches for @entity124			0
‘ i took the under 15s for six months , then i was taking the under 16s , and that second year i was still teaching i was playing in the reserves , ’ he explains .			0
