you may recognise the name @entity2 following her integral marketing role at a little site called @entity5 , which was , coincidentally , founded by her brother , @entity6			1
while at the company , she pioneered and ran the social media marketing programs for the brand and introduced @entity5 's live - streaming initiatives			2
since then , however , the tech - savvy founder and ceo of @entity13 and the editor - in - chief of @entity15 , has made it her mission to help others unplug from their wired , technology - filled lives			1
@entity2 has made it her mission to help you ' unplug ' while on holiday with @entity23 thus , the ' @entity25 ' collaboration with @entity23 ' @entity26 was born			1
the year - long programme , which encourages guests to find a tech - life balance while on holiday , kicked off this month with a new line - up of specially designed spa treatments and services on board			1
with offerings like ' @entity36 , ' which is a facial designed to treat skin care needs relating to staring at a computer and tablet screens , and the ' texticure ' manicure complete with softening paraffin wax , the treatments are as witty as they are relaxing			1
and it 's the manicure that 's @entity2 's favourite , as it forces her to take a break from responding to emails			2
along with the luxury liner , @entity2 has crafted a menu of tech - specific detox spa treatments ' it ’s so luxurious and immediately moisturises your hands , ' she tells @entity52			1
' and because they ’re in gloves , you ca n’t even send a text message while you ’re getting it			0
' @entity2 's interest in the precarious tech - life balance , as she calls it , first began when she was researching her book @entity15 : @entity59			1
' i 'd been thinking so much about the wonderful opportunities that technology presents in our lives , but i was also talking to a lot psychologists and observing how our behaviours with tech are n't always helping , ' she explains			2
' we tend to border on addictive and obsessive - in fact , the average person checks their phone 150 times a day			2
' because technology is new and magical , we have n't quite established balance and boundaries			2
' the entrepreneur and tech guru also shares her tips for maintaining a healthy work - life balance in her own life the average person checks their phone 150 times per day , so it 's important to make an effort to disconnect but that 's not to say @entity2 does n't understand the appeal and that she is n't guilty of over-checking her mobile herself from time to time			1
' i 'm a working mum with two young children , so i feel like technology is my lifesaver and the whole reason that i can be doing what i 'm doing , ' she says			0
' but being always connected can be a blessing and a curse , especially when you feel like you 're always reachable			0
' and when you 're on holiday , those little devices in your pocket make it so easy			0
i call it ' snacking			0
' it 's that moment when you have a minute of downtime , but instead of thinking about something creative , it 's easy to mindlessly whip out your phone and scroll through feeds			0
' @entity2 's trick is to keep her phone in another room during family time and keep the attention on her kids so , what 's her advice to keep ' snacking ' at a minimum - both while on holiday and at home ? ' i try to put my phone in a different room at home , ' she tells @entity52			1
' when you 're with your family , it 's about quality time			0
make eye contact and put the phone away			0
' but most of all , @entity2 wants people to understand that it 's simply not possible to do every single thing on your to - do list every single day			1
so , instead , pick a few things to focus on and - especially when you 're on holiday - be sure to take time to relax and fit in the odd spa treatment			1
' i have a mantra , ' she says			0
' it 's five words that i repeat : work , sleep , friends , family , fitness			0
you ca n't pick five because it 's impossible to do all five well everyday			0
' as long as it balances out in the long run , you should feel happy and proud			0
