but taking a bite of these ones would leave you with a mouth full of splinters			2
these are the creation of art professor @entity11 , who carves , turns , bends and laminates wood to looks like fabrics , glass , stone and fruit			1
after applying waterborne lacquer paint with spray guns and brushes , the results are hyper - realistic , if a touch surreal			1
these apples are some of art professor @entity11 's wooden creations it 's not just the cards that play tricks : the silky fabric is a highly - finished piece of wood @entity34 , plastic and fabric are all part of the mirage in professor @entity11 's work a realistic - looking pebble , complete with chipped marks , appears to float in this carved bowl it 's not just still life that captures professor @entity11 's imagination : here it looks like a gun barrel concealed under silk , while a snake wraps itself around the leg of a stool professor @entity11 , who teaches at @entity52 , said : ' the woods i prefer working with are basswood , linden and limewood because they carve and paint well and are very stable			1
' coming from a painting and drawing background , i am still interested in applying some of those techniques to my sculptures			0
' the professor 's curiosity for realism was piqued by a childhood car trip			2
' one of my earliest recollections , on a car trip , was my perception of the wet , slick highway ahead that turned out to be an illusion , a mirage , ' he said			0
@entity73 , goblets , jugs and a kettle form this still life portait one of professor @entity11 's early wooden works was this @entity79 the intricate carving of the bomb wires and other sculptures requires an array of tools and techniques professor @entity11 sprays and brushes waterborne lacquer paint onto his works the cork is n't the only piece of wood in this bottle of wine , sat atop a tall table polished cutlery awaits on this side table , but all the objects are wood carvings floating pebbles appear to have cloth slithering over them but these are one carving ' by tradition , cloth has been widely used to conceal and shroud objects in practices ranging from advertising to church rituals			1
' covered forms are often more evocative - with a sense of mystery absent from the uncovered object by itself			0
' i remember in church one @entity115 , as a child , being mystified while gazing at the statues shrouded with purple cloth			0
' this visual deception is now the basis for my creative direction			0
' when this idea is applied to my compositions ( floating book , floating cards , floating rock ) a sense of the impossible happens - for me , magic			0
' this wooden window scene is almost a glance into the outside world the professor says he likes the ' sense of mystery ' concealed objects give professor @entity11 prefers to use basswood , linden and limewood for his pieces he favours the materials because they carve easily and hold paint well @entity141 looks to be balancing precariously in this piece by @entity11 @entity144 drawers in a set of drawers , next to a knife reflecting the craftsmanship involved you would n't want to rub your face on this towel , whittled from wood professor @entity11 's fascination with hyper - realistic art was sparked in his childhood and now it 's his career the wood was fashioned into this branch seemingly floating above a block of granite for this sculpture the careful precision of professor @entity11 makes the wooden fabric look wrinkled it takes painstaking attention and care to make wood look like hanging fabric here the wood is transformed into a patent high heeled shoe atop a silky garment professor @entity11 says that the sense of visual deception is ' magic ' the wood requires close attention and careful whittling in the professor 's workshop the life - size sculptures are created with the aid of professor @entity11 's students			1
