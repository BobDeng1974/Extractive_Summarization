@entity3 , 17 , set up an account using a stock photograph and the name @entity5			1
he claimed to be a freelance writer for the @entity16 and @entity17 , while posting football rumours designed to raise his profile among ' gullible ' fans			2
his @entity11 account was suspended last month after his ploy was uncovered by genuine journalists , but thanks to lucky guesses which seemed to confirm his insider status , he was able to rack up 25,000 followers on the site			0
@entity3 's plan initially involved pretending to be former football scout @entity30 , a reporter a @entity31 , but was closed down after complaints from the title			1
he then switched to the @entity5 persona , and would pretend to be covering international matches on the ground , and would ' confirm ' existing rumours			0
the told the @entity17 that he targeted fans of troubled clubs with his bogus revelations ' because they 'd be the most vulnerable '			0
@entity3 said : ' at first i did n’t know what i was doing – a couple of rumours , stats ... i ’d take a picture of the @entity48 [ where @entity50 play ] and say " reporting live "			1
' in late 2012 he claimed to know that @entity53 were set to sack their manager @entity54 , and put the ' news ' online one day before the club confirmed it			0
the fluke gave him ' a lot of credibility ' , and allowed him to get in touch with players from major teams via @entity11 and actually discuss transfer rumours			2
