by @entity1 - @entity0 follow @ @ riathalsam last september , a tennis coach got on a plane for @entity4 and started a two - day conversation that might just give the men ’s game the shake - up it ’s been waiting for , and might just cause @entity9 a sleepless night			1
that coach was @entity11 , a former @entity12 footballer and known gut - buster , and the prodigy he spoke to was @entity15 , the then 22 - year - old from a tough street in @entity17 who had grown tired of his own hype			1
‘ he phoned me one day , ’ @entity11 told @entity20			1
‘ i had watched him since he was 16			1
i had seen what he has to bring , his abilities			2
' i see @entity15 as a @entity35 winner , ' he says			1
' the improvements he has made in the past year are obvious , though it was n't obvious he would take the step up			2
' i 'd say he is at the front of the new players coming through			2
' he is like a raw @entity44 - not as polished but he has an excellent all - round game on all courts			1
' he is a threat to @entity9 and the rest already			2
' @entity15 was the teenage star with the elegant style who in a three - month period in 2008 won the junior events at the @entity52 and @entity53			1
his former coach @entity54 , who had once mentored @entity44 , had said that at 18 he was further up the curve than the @entity56 who won the lot			1
that ’s where the @entity15 tag came from ; @entity15 was flattered and quite liked it			1
‘ it ’s great to hear , ’ he said in june 2011			2
‘ i can hear this all day , put a ringtone on my phone , but you ca n’t compare the greatest player of all time to a dude that is 64 in the world			2
’ by the time @entity11 got on a plane in @entity74 , @entity15 had won zero senior titles and the @entity15 label annoyed him			1
he had reached the top 30 — and unwittingly played a part in a feud between @entity80 and @entity81 , having dated both — but a player with that all - round game was deemed to be underachieving			2
he had all the shots but was often too flamboyant for his own good and he had been fined € 2,000 in 2010 for shoving an umpire at a @entity89 event			2
comparison : @entity15 has often been called ' @entity15 ' after @entity56 master @entity44 loosening up : @entity44 has a hit on the practice courts on the @entity93 chilling : @entity44 talks to his coach @entity94 during practice at @entity96 on sunday there were also suggestions that his fitness was not what it could be , a point underlined by @entity102 last year : ‘ that guy comes out so hot but we know he ca n’t sustain it			1
if he could he would be no 1 in the world			2
’ perhaps those words were in his mind when he picked up the phone to @entity11			1
‘ he saw he needed to make some legitimate changes , ’ said @entity11 , who had worked with @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			1
‘ i have strong philosophies on what sort of people i want to work with — people with a genuine fuel for life			2
i flew to @entity4 from @entity74			2
we spoke a lot over two days before i flew back			0
' i always ask “ what do you want out of this ? ” straight out he says he wants to be the no 1 player in the world			0
’ @entity15 has since won his first four senior titles			1
on friday he twice fought back from a set down to beat @entity130 in a five - set match			0
shape : there were suggestions of @entity15 's fitness and @entity102 said he knew ' he ca n't sustain ' change : the best way for @entity15 to respond to criticism of his fitness and attitude was on the court his interviews have been dominated by his mentions of @entity11 and his new - found ability to endure fights that reach the later rounds ; his irritation has been obvious when questions then turn to @entity80 and that @entity15 nickname			1
‘ i think it ’s time for everyone to kind of come up with something better , ’ he said on friday			0
‘ i ’m proving myself not only as a player but as a person outside of the court			0
’ that person , it is said by those around him , is desperately competitive , a man whose lifelong refusal to drink alcohol has bemused a woman even as driven as @entity80			0
much of it boils down to his upbringing as the only child of an ambitious tennis coach father , @entity165 , and a mother , @entity80 , who played high - level volleyball			1
by five years old he was playing matches			0
he describes home , a remote area in @entity171 , as being in a ‘ tough neighbourhood — there was a lot of poverty ’			0
partner : @entity15 and girlfriend @entity80 out and about enjoying the @entity178 sunshine on the march : @entity180 champion @entity80 has cruised through the first week of the @entity181 roar : @entity11 thinks ' it 's time for everyone to kind of come up with something better ' than @entity15 @entity53 : day 6 roundup @entity11 said : ‘ his family are genuine , hard - working people , respectful people who respect everyone			1
he is a copy of them			0
they respect the king and they would respect the person who picks up the garbage on sunday			0
‘ the work ethic is very important			0
you have to understand how hard he had to work to come through like he did			0
‘ @entity17 is not somewhere where you have a pool of players to compete against and push you on			0
he found a way to do it without that			0
‘ he has that drive			0
i ’ve seen what he ’s about when he trains			0
we have pushed him to some pretty unstable points — that ’s a hard place but a great place			0
but he has a look in his eyes			0
it ’s what he wants			0
’ change : @entity11 says @entity15 is hard working and respectful , much like the family life he comes from the upshot is a place in the fourth round against @entity216 , the world no 59 , then he faces a quarter - final against @entity9 if all goes to script			1
he beat the @entity53 champion earlier this year and it is a potential tie that fascinates observers of the game			0
no sport cries out for a new wave of champions quite like tennis ; no player from that group of possible contenders carries quite the same weight of expectation as @entity15			1
the question is whether his time has come			0
is it ? @entity15 needs to make his chances count and the question is whether his time has come			1

@entity15 wants to get rid of ' @entity15 ' *branding*
nickname came from former coach @entity54 , who mentored @entity44 , and said @entity15 at 18 was *furhter* down line than the @entity56
