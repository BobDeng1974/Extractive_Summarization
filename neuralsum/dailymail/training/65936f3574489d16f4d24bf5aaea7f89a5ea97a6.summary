cocaine dealing @entity1 , 27 , known as @entity12 , passed on information he got from searching @entity15 databases so his gang had a plentiful supply of drugs			1
he also updated them on what the cops knew about the gang so they could avoid getting caught and he even helped a convict who escaped from prison stay on the run			1

' that , however , was not the end of it			0
you did not simply give family and friends information they were not entitled to , there was a continued and sustained misuse of information on that computer			0
' your relationship with criminals can only be described as improper and corrupt			0
' you gave them information on what the police knew about them and what addresses they had under suspicion			1
' and you told them addresses where cannabis factories could be found so they could then steal them knowing the owners of such properties would not report the theft of illegal drugs			2
' your sideline to your legal employment was dealing in class a and class b drugs			0
' it makes little difference , if any , that you were not a fully warranted police officer			0

it ’s ridiculous ' to his distraught family as he was led down to the cells			0
earlier his barrister @entity99 told the court he came from a ‘ respectable and law - abiding @entity102 family ’ and had good intentions when he joined the @entity27 in 2003			2
but he claimed the @entity105 and @entity106 where @entity1 worked encouraged idleness and was rife with gambling			2
he was also bullied for being dyslexic			0
the court heard sergeants and senior officers at the @entity105 and @entity112 were dismissed after the investigation into @entity1 exposed their incredible gambling habits			2
‘ much has been written about what went on in the pre-fabricated office where the team was based , ’ said @entity99 , defending @entity1			2
‘ the ethos he ran into there did little to encourage his ambitions , or meet his hopes for the police force			0

‘ many of them have now been disciplined as a result of this particular surveillance			0
‘ the extent to which gambling went on there was quite frankly shocking , with young officers becoming in debt to senior officers			0
’ when he first illegally accessed computers in the summer of 2007 mr @entity99 said it was a ‘ misguided attempt to impress others and make him seem more important and interesting than perhaps he was			0
’ @entity1 was later paid for information by various criminal pals and even tipped them off with intelligence on where ‘ @entity168 ’ or cannabis factories were			1
in bugged recordings which trapped him @entity1 is heard boasting he was doing other dealers a favour by moving the drugs before police busted them			1
' see the way i look at it i ’m doing these boys a favour ...			0
