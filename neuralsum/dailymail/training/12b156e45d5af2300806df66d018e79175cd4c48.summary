by @entity0 published : 09:38 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 10:15 est , 31 october 2013 this is the moment a reckless swimmer was caught on camera walking into 15ft waves for fun on the same day @entity7 's storm hit @entity8			1
the man was spotted in the sea as the towering waves lashed the shoreline at @entity13 in @entity14 on monday to the astonishment of crowds who had gathered to watch the extreme weather			1
the thrill - seeking swimmer was seen walking into the waves with his arms outstretched , and even lay down in the swell to float on his back			1
the stunt was later branded ' extremely dangerous ' by lifeguards , and came just 24 hours after 14 - year - old @entity26 was swept to his death by a giant wave in @entity29 , @entity30			1
' idiot ' : the man is seen with his arms outstretched walking towards stormy seas at @entity13 , @entity14 ' chances of survival are slim ' : an @entity37 official said that if the man was caught up in the current he would probably have died the man was caught on camera by photographer @entity40 , who was taking pictures of the raging sea at around 9am			1
he said : ' i could n’t believe it			2
my first reaction was , ‘ what an idiot ’			2
he could easily have got into trouble			0
' it was an incredibly stupid thing to do			0
other people said exactly the same to me			0
' although the man had a lucky escape , his ' incredibly stupid ' actions have outraged the lifeguards who would have had to save him if he got into trouble			1
@entity55 , an incident reduction with the @entity37 , said the swimmer was lucky to get out of the sea alive			0
he said there was the risk of drowning , dying from cold water shock or from being battered on to rocks by the crashing waves			2
drifting to disaster : astonishingly , the man lay back and floated in the waters , before heading back to shore reckless : the man stands in front of the receding waves , surrounded by rocks mr @entity55 said : ' taking to the sea in such challenging conditions and with inappropriate clothing is not only foolish but extremely dangerous for you and for those @entity37 volunteers who may have to come and rescue you if the sea washes you away			1
' the sea is far more powerful than you think and your chances of survival are slim if you are dragged away by the swell			2
' we understand why people want to experience extreme weather , but we would urge folk to watch the conditions from a safe distance so we do n’t have to put our charity ’s volunteer lifeboat teams in danger , or those of our colleagues in other emergency services who may ultimately be called to try and rescue you			0
' danger : @entity97 , a coastguard at nearby @entity99 , urged bathers to take care in all weather conditions @entity97 , a coastguard at nearby @entity99 , urged bathers to take care in all weather conditions , not just storms			0
he said : ' checking the tide and weather conditions should always be done and it is advisable to let someone know your intentions			0
' in addition , and perhaps more importantly , people should be realistic about their abilities			0
' while these pictures are dramatic , we do n’t know anything about this man ’s swimming ability			0
' a poor swimmer in relatively calm sea conditions could be at just as much risk , perhaps even more , than this man at @entity13			1
' however , it would be reasonable to say that in such sea conditions watching from a safe place is probably a more sensible idea for all concerned			0
' @entity131 's storm claimed five lives in total and more than a quarter of a million people were left without power .			1

he was seen at @entity13 , @entity14 on monday during @entity131 's storm
he walked into the waves arms outstretched and even lay down in the swell
lifeguards are appalled and have branded the stunt ' extremely dangerous '
