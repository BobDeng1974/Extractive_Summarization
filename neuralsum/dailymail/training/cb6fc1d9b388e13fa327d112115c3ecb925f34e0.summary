by @entity0 many have suspected it for years , but now research proves it – driving with your other half sends your stress levels soaring			0
motorists feel four times more stressed or anxious if their ‘ significant other ’ is alongside them in the car			1
the research released today by @entity11 concludes : ‘ drivers are happier , more confident and focused when driving by themselves			1
’ motorists feel four times more stressed or anxious if their ¿ significant other ¿ is alongside them in the car by contrast it notes : ‘ @entity21 ’ almost quadruples a driver ’s likelihood of feeling stressed or anxious behind the wheel , a potentially dangerous combination			1
‘ having their ‘ significant other ’ in the car alongside them makes drivers feel twice as rushed which reduces the chance of them feeling calm and relaxed by nearly 65 per cent			1
’ @entity11 says this ‘ increases the risk of having an accident ’			1
drivers told pollsters that the addition of any passenger increases their stress levels but that having one ’s wife , husband , boyfriend , girlfriend or ‘ partner ’ alongside			2
but it ’s not equally matched between the sexes , with men appearing to wind up women more than the other way round			1
when driving with their partners in the car , fewer than a third ( 32per cent ) of women feel calm and relaxed , compared to 43per cent of men			1
and the maternal gene clearly does n’t help when it comes to off - spring			0
for when driving with their own children in the car , only a quarter of women ( 25per cent ) feel calm and relaxed , compared to a third of men ( 33per cent )			1
also in the top five in - car stress - inducers are : other people ’s children , your own children			0
parents , and other family members			0
other top five - stress inducers are other people 's children and your own children when it comes to road locations where drivers feel most stressed , city centres top the poll with nearly 1 in 5 ( 18per cent ) citing it , followed by town areas ( 8 per cent ) , motorways ( 8 per cent ) and dual carriageways ( 5 per cent )			2
drivers feel most rushed when commuting to and from work ( 15per cent ) , driving to appointments such as visiting the doctor ( 15per cent ) and driving children to school ( 11per cent )			1
by contrast the calmest drivers can be found on @entity89 ’s country roads , cited by more than half of those polled ( 52per cent )			0
the biggest worry for drivers on the road are ‘ other drivers ’ , cited by more than half of respondents ( 52 % ) , followed by tailgating ( 45 % ) and aggressive ‘ road rage ’ drivers ( 41 % )			2
on motorways some 1 in 6 ( 16 % ) of women feel anxious , compared to only 1 in 12 ( 8 % ) men – half the proportion			2
by contrast fewer than a third ( 29 % ) of women feel calm and relaxed on a motorway , compared to almost half ( 46 % ) men			0
driving in town areas , some one in 6 ( 12 % ) of women feel anxious , compared to 1 in 12 ( 8 % ) of men			0

the research was carried out by @entity123 with 1,000 respondents who drive regularly			0
@entity125 , ceo of @entity11 said : ‘ the tales of back seat drivers and in - car arguments we ’re all so familiar with , cause stress and distraction when drivers should be feeling calm and focused			1
' it ’s important that motorists and their partners are aware of the risks a stressful environment in a vehicle can create			0
