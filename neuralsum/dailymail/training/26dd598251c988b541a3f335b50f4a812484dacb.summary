the failed @entity4 vote to pull out from the @entity5 stirred secessionist hopes for some in the @entity8 , where almost a quarter of people are open to their states leaving the union , a new @entity2 / @entity1 poll found			1
some 23.9 percent of @entity8 polled from august 23 through september 16 said they strongly supported or tended to support the idea of their state breaking away , while 53.3 per cent of the 8,952 respondents strongly opposed or tended to oppose the notion			1
the urge to sever ties with @entity20 cuts across party lines and regions , though @entity23 and residents of rural @entity26 states are generally warmer to the idea than @entity28 and @entity29 , according to the poll			1
but others said long - running @entity20 gridlock had prompted them to wonder if their states would be better off striking out on their own , a move no @entity8 state has tried in the 150 years since the bloody @entity51 that led to the end of slavery in the @entity55			1
' i do n't think it makes a whole lot of difference anymore which political party is running things			1
nothing gets done , ' said @entity63 , 61 , of @entity64 , @entity65 , who lives on disability payments			2
' the state would be better off handling things on its own			2
' scottish unionists won by a wider - than - expected 10 - percentage - point margin			2
falling public approval of the @entity34 administration , attention to the @entity4 vote and the success of activists who accuse the @entity8 government of overstepping its authority - such as the self - proclaimed militia members who flocked to @entity83 's @entity82 ranch earlier this year during a standoff over grazing rights - is driving up interest in secession , experts said			1
' it seems to have heated up , especially since the election of president @entity34 , ' said @entity91 , a professor of governmental affairs at the @entity92 at @entity93 , who has studied secessionist movements			2
republicans were more inclined to support the idea , with 29.7 per cent favoring it compared with 21 per cent of @entity28			1
@entity99 , a 31 - year - old nurse from @entity100 , @entity101 , said anger over the ' @entity104 ' healthcare reform law made her wonder if her state would be better off on its own			1
minority vote : republicans were more inclined to support the idea , with 29.7 per cent favoring it compared with 21 per cent of @entity28 ' that has really hurt a lot of people here , myself included			1
my insurance went from $ 40 a week for a family of four up to over $ 600 a month for a family of four , ' said @entity99 , a @entity23			2
' the @entity101 government itself is sustainable			2
governor ( @entity120 ) @entity119 , i think he has a better healthcare plan than president @entity34			0
' by region , the idea was least popular in @entity125 , the cradle of the @entity127 , with just 17.4 per cent of respondents open to pulling their state out			1
it was most popular in the @entity131 , where 34.1 per cent of respondents back the idea			1
that region includes @entity135 , where an activist group is calling the state 's legislature to put the secession question on a statewide ballot			0
one @entity135 respondent said he was confident his state could get by without the rest of the country			0
' @entity135 has everything we need			0
we have the manufacturing , we have the oil , and we do n't need them , ' said @entity150 , a 59 - year - old retiree living outside @entity151 on disability payments			0
@entity150 , a @entity23 , had cheered on the @entity4 independence movement			0
' i have totally , completely lost faith in the federal government , the people running it , whether @entity23 , @entity160 , independent , whatever , ' he said			0
dissent : anger with president @entity34 's handling of issues ranging from healthcare reform to the rise of @entity39 militants drives some of the feeling , with @entity23 respondents citing dissatisfaction with his administration as coloring their thinking even in @entity135 , some respondents said talk about breaking away was more of a sign of their anger with @entity20 than evidence of a real desire to go it alone			1
democrat @entity179 , of @entity180 , said the threat could persuade @entity20 lawmakers and the @entity183 to listen more closely to average people 's concerns			0
' when i say secede , i 'm not like ( former @entity187 president ) @entity186 with my gun up in the air , ' my cold dead hands			0
' it 's more like â€“ we could do it if we had to , ' said @entity194 , 62			0
' but the first option is , golly , get it back on the right track			0
but there might come a point that we say , ' hey , y'all , we 're dusting our hands and we 're moving on			0

roughly 23.9 per cent of @entity8 polled favored breaking away from the union
number of republicans in favor of a split was *slightly* *higher* than those registered as @entity28
many blame ' @entity104 ' or political gridlock for their *disillusionment*
