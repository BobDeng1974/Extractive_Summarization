by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor interest rates will not be hiked to tackle runaway house prices despite fears they are running out of control , the @entity3 's governor @entity2 revealed this morning			1
mr @entity2 said using the @entity3 's power to put up interest rates on people 's mortgages ' would not be the right tool ' to to tackle a house price bubble			1
he added : ' will not target house prices			1
' his remarks come amid growing fears that ordinary family homes are becoming unaffordable - even as fresh figures suggested that the economic recovery had finally taken hold			2
the bank chief warned however that the recovery had not yet made it ' through the qualifying rounds of the @entity24 ' despite falling unemployment , rising wages and house price increases			1
@entity3 governor @entity2 admitted the prospect of rate rises had moved closer - but revealed they were likely to stay historically low a long time to come @entity33 prices soared by 9.2 per cent across the country last year - and by more than 18 per cent in @entity35			1
this far outstripped the 1.7 per cent rise in average earnings in the year to march , according to figures released by the @entity40 today			2
wages are , however , now increasing slightly more than inflation - currently running at 1.6 per cent - for first time in four years			1
mr @entity2 this morning said the @entity3 would only use a rate rise as a ' last resort ' to tackle runaway house prices			1
' we do have a range of other tools and these are tools , some of which we have a very high degree of confidence about their effectiveness , ' mr @entity2 said			1
he said the @entity3 ' can not control all aspects of the housing market ' , adding that has no power to build a single one of the 120,000 houses experts say are needed houses needed to meet demand			1
but mr @entity2 admitted that the booming economy had ' edged closer ' the time when interest rates would begin rising again after more than five years at just 0.5 per cent			1
just last week the @entity3 held the rate at its record low for another month			1
the @entity3 governor this morning said house price rises would not influence their decision to increase interest rates @entity72 ’s economy has ' started to head back to normal ' , @entity2 said			1
but he stressed that any increase would be ' gradual and limited ' and warned that it ' may stay at historically low levels for some time '			1
he added that the economic recovery was not yet secure			2
he said : ‘ securing the recovery is like making it through the qualifying rounds of the @entity24			2
‘ that is an achievement , but not the ultimate goal			0
the real tournament is just beginning and its prize is a strong , sustained and balanced expansion			0
across the @entity3 we are setting policy in order to help win that prize for the good of the people of the @entity72			2
’ mr @entity92 's remarks prompted bookmakers to slash the odds on an interest rate rise before the @entity96			1
despite the governor 's attempts to downplay the possibility , @entity97 cut the odds of a rate rise before may next year to 4/6			1
but the chances of rates staying at 0.5 % until next year 's likely poll have been pushed out to 11/10 from even money			2
@entity107 of @entity97 said : ' @entity2 's not convinced us in the slightest and the odds of a rise have been cut accordingly			1
' mr @entity2 's intervention this morning came after figures revealed the number of people in work has reached a record high after further falls in unemployment			2
but @entity120 claimed the figures obscured the fact that ordinary families were still feeling the squeeze			0
employment minister @entity124 welcomed this morning 's employment figures as more evidence that the economic recovery had taken hold shadow work and pensions secretary @entity129 said : ' average earnings have finally crept up above @entity132 inflation , though only when bonuses are included , and there is a huge amount of lost ground to catch up			2
' working people are now over £ 1,600 a year worse off than when @entity138 came to office and the link between the wealth of the nation and family finances remains broken			0
' while the top one per cent have seen their share of national income rise over the last year , the bottom 90 per cent have seen theirs fall			0
it 's totally out of touch for the @entity150 to try and claim the cost - of - living crisis faced by hardworking @entity72 is suddenly over			0
' thousands of people in work are struggling to make ends meet because the government 's failure to make work pay and tackle the cost - of - living crisis			0
' @entity158 general secretary @entity157 added : ' gdp per head is still 5.8 % below 2007 levels			0
" that is the root cause of average earnings being down 13.8 % in real terms since then			0
the pay of the bottom half of the workforce is still being squeezed			0
public sector workers ' pay is being frozen or increasing less than inflation			0
" the @entity171 's general secretary @entity170 backed mr @entity157 - and urged the government not to ' kid themselves ' that the recovery was pulling everyone out of poverty			0
she said : ' it a real concern that rising employment is failing to boost pay , which is barely growing in real terms			0
this should serve as a reminder to the @entity3 that this is not a full - blown recovery , and that an early rise in interest rates could choke it off			1
' however the @entity150 employment minister @entity124 said : ' as the recovery takes hold , more people are able to get a job or set up their own business and become the employers of tomorrow			0
' each and every person who has made a new start or hired someone new is helping to make @entity72 a more prosperous and confident place to be			0
' we will continue to support those in and out of work who want to get on and fulfil their ambitions for a more secure future			0
' prime minister @entity138 tweeted : ' there 's more to do , but it 's welcome unemployment is down again			0
more jobs means more financial security for people			0
