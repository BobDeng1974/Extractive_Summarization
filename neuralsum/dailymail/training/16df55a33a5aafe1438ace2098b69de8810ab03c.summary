by @entity0 @entity1 became a hit after an email he sent at @entity4 about a colleague went viral it seems the luck of the @entity9 it worker who rose to notoriety after proclaiming his love for a @entity4 colleague on his farewell email just has n't changed			1
mr @entity1 has now confessed to ' winning ' a poker machine jackpot ... of just three cents			1
and the 28 - year - old admitted his luck with the ladies has n't changed since he was rejected by @entity18 at @entity4 , admitting he 's ' still available '			1
the former @entity4 worker rose to fame in march when he sent an email to more than 1000 colleagues professing his ' long term crush ' on @entity18			1
his latest turn of bad luck came while he was drinking with a few mates in @entity9 's inner west , and decided to put some money in the pokies			2
clearly a sucker for public humiliation , mr @entity1 posted his ' win ' on @entity33			1
but mr @entity1 was still looking on the bright side on his recent tales of misfortune , telling the @entity37 : ' i know my surname is @entity40 but i 'm anything but fortunate			1
' ' @entity42 , gambling ... the list can go on			0
' he did say , however , that he had plans for investing his three cents into some everyday expenses or even a ' holiday			0
' ' i 'll probably just put it towards some fuel , that 's really expensive now , or even a holiday			0
' ' i just thought it would be funny , taking this ticket to the counter and asking for my three cents			2
' ' the woman just looked at me and scratched her head , thinking ' how do i do this ? ' ' i think the funniest part of the night was her reaction			0
' unlucky : mr @entity1 lost $ 19.97 after putting in an initial investment of $ 20 into a pokie machine at a pub at @entity64 in @entity9 's inner west the girl believed to be @entity18 ( centre ) , was part of the inspiration for @entity1 's 1,4000 - word farewell email back in march , after six years at @entity4 , mr @entity1 finally summoned the courage to announce his love for a colleague when he shared a 14,000 - word farewell email with 1000 @entity4 staff			1
in it , he admitted he had never had the ' guts to tell anyone ' how he felt , but thought what better time than his final day to let his emotions escape			0
' now i never had the guts to tell anyone at work what i ’m about to say , it would be unprofessional , however i ’m leaving so it does n’t matter , ' he wrote in the email			0
' this may or may not come as a surprise to you as i do n’t think you ever knew @entity18 , but now that i ’m leaving it wo n’t matter ... i think you ’re really cute in a beautiful way			2
in the days after the email went viral , mr @entity1 took to @entity96 to react to the public response			2
' hopefully this sudden attention does not tarnish my reputation or career ! @entity18 is doing okay ... what a ride so far ! still in shock ... ' however , he told @entity37 on tuesday the pair have cut ties and have n't spoken since : ' me and her were friends ... we worked it all out but then when it went viral s * * * got real , so we decided not to talk			1
' for those ladies wondering : ' yes , still single , ' he said			0

' at the time a @entity112 spokeswoman declined to comment , saying : ' it was a personal email and we wo n’t be commenting			0
