by @entity0 @entity1 , the @entity6 @entity3 debutant who impressed in the @entity4 and @entity5 , will not start stage 16 when the race resumes on tuesday			1
@entity1 featured in the breakaway on saturday ’s second stage in the @entity4 , and was only caught 5.5km from the summit of @entity12			1
but he admitted at the start of stage 15 on sunday morning that his ‘ big day out ’ had taken its toll			1
‘ i ’m pretty tired , ’ said @entity1			2
' sunday was a really big effort and i ’m knackered at the minute			1
@entity1 finished sunday ’s flat stage safely in the peloton , but with the @entity33 still to come , his team put his long - term health over short - term ambitions			1
‘ it ’s a massive jump to come to the @entity3 from where he ’s been , ’ said @entity1 ’s sports director @entity36			0
‘ there should be five or six steps in between			0
it ’s a sink or swim thing but he ’s definitely been swimming			0
‘ he ’s had three attempts at a breakaway and made two of them , ’ added @entity36			1
‘ to make a @entity3 breakaway is incredibly hard , everyone wants to be in them , and saturday was a very , very strong breakaway			0
’ strong debutant : the 21 - year - old was appearing in his first @entity3 competition @entity55 takes second stage win as @entity57 consolidates lead @entity1 and his twin brother , @entity58 , have been two revelations of the season , with @entity58 winning the @entity61 in may			1
it was in @entity63 that @entity1 crashed and broke his collarbone — a setback that , ironically , opened the door to a start at the tour while @entity58 was rested			0
@entity36 said of both @entity1 brothers : ‘ they know how to sniff out breakaways , they can climb and they know how to win races			0
they have an awesome attitude			0
’ meanwhile , there was heartbreak for @entity79 as the race left the mountains and arrived in @entity82			2
the 29 - year - old @entity83 attacked at the start of the stage and almost held on for the win 222km later			1
keeping up : @entity1 , centre , was part of the breakaway group during the eighth stage on july 12 instead , he was swamped by the sprinters in the final 20 metres and crossed the line 10th			2
‘ in the last kilometre i thought i could win , ’ said @entity79 , who , with breakaway partner @entity93 of @entity94 , held off the rampaging peloton even as the sprinters ’ teams hunted them down			0
the beneficiary was @entity99 , the @entity100 sprinter who now has two stage wins			2
‘ i hoped ( @entity79 ) would hold on for second place , ’ @entity55 said .			0

the 21 - year - old , making his @entity61 debut , impressed in the previous stage
but on sunday he admitted being ' knackered ' after a gruelling few weeks
his team @entity25 made the decision to withdraw him from the race on sunday evening
