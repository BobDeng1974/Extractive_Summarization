taxing : @entity0 is struggling to win over @entity2 territories and crown dependencies to his plan to crackdown n tax havens @entity0 ’s global crackdown on tax avoidance could be jettisoned by @entity9			1
the prime minister had hoped to secure a major agreement with tax havens suspected of allowing the mega-rich to hide their wealth from the @entity2 taxman			1
but @entity9 is so far refusing to sign up to the transparency deal ahead of next week ’s @entity18			1
mr @entity0 hoped to use a meeting with 10 @entity2 overseas territories and crown dependencies as proof he is cracking down on the ‘ scourge of tax evasion ’ which costs @entity2 billions			1
senior ministers from @entity9 , the @entity26 , the @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , the @entity31 and @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and the @entity35 are expected to attend the summit in @entity37 on saturday			1
but @entity9 's premier @entity38 has signalled he will not sign up to the deal , raising the prospect of other territories refusing to take part			1
mr @entity0 has made the tax avoidance and evasion a priority of the @entity18 which he is hosting in @entity46 on june 17 and 18			2
he has warned overseas territories of the need to ‘ get our own houses in order ’			0
some of the islands and outposts are widely regarded as offshore tax havens , though they dispute this description and regard their low - tax regimes as vital to their economies			0
mr @entity0 wants them all to sign up to the @entity60 , which includes keeping a list owners of companies which can then be checked by tax authorities from around the world			2
however , @entity9 claims it already meets many of the provisions and is not ready to commit to signing the convention			2
premier mr @entity38 told @entity68 : ‘ there 's some clauses in there that we need to look at , that may need to be adjusted , and ... our finance ministry is going over it with a fine - tooth comb			0
’ he also questioned whether mr @entity0 will be able to achieve broad agreement from all the territories this week			0
reluctance : the government of @entity9 is yet to sign up to a global convention on sharing data about companies and the tax they pay however , a spokesman for the @entity27 government said it has already agreed to commit to the @entity60			1
@entity33 , @entity34 and the @entity35 have also signalled that they are ready to sign the @entity89 convention			2
mr @entity0 yesterday insisted he could secure ‘ further progress ’ with overseas territories at this weekend ’s meeting			0
he added : ‘ people rightly get angry when they work hard , they pay their taxes and then see others not paying their fair share			0
‘ but in a globalised world , no one country can on their own effectively stamp out either tax evasion or aggressive tax avoidance and this is exactly the sort of issue that the leaders of the eight major economies should address			0
we should be galvanising international action			0
’ clash : mr @entity0 hopes to persuade the leaders of the world 's biggest economies to sign up to new tax rules but ahead of the @entity18 there have been protests in @entity37 pressure is mounting on mr @entity0 to secure a landmark agreement on tax at the @entity18 with the leaders of the world 's largest economies in @entity117 at the @entity119 golf resort			1
there have already been angry anti-capitalist protests in @entity37 , and campaigners have warned the prime minister risks failing to live up to his rhetoric			1
last month he wrote to the @entity2 overseas territories warning them that he had made ‘ fighting the scourge of tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance ’ a priority for the @entity18			1
he added : ‘ i am looking to all the overseas territories and crown dependencies to continue to work in partnership with the @entity2 in taking the lead on two critical issues : tax information exchange and beneficial ownership			2
‘ i respect your right to be lower tax jurisdictions			0
i believe passionately in lower taxes as a vital driver of growth and prosperity for all			0
‘ but lower taxes are only sustainable if what is owed is actually paid - and if the rules to achieve this are set and enforced fairly to create a level playing field right across the world			0
‘ there is no point in dealing with tax evasion in one country if the problem is simply displaced to another			0
'' he has hailed a breakthrough in talks to secure an @entity160 - wide deal on sharing information to stop multi-national firms avoiding paying tax			2
the prime minister said @entity166 agreement had been reached on tackling tax evasion and avoidance , after warning countries face ' staggering ' losses .			1

prime minister has *summoned* 10 @entity2 territories to @entity37 meeting
wants them to sign up to global convention on sharing data on tax
but @entity9 's refusal could *scupper* hopes of a deal ahead of @entity18
