by @entity0 published : 05:50 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 08:38 est , 20 november 2012 quit ? @entity1 named a teenager who allegedly ran away with a teacher and her @entity5 account has now gone @entity1 today finally deleted her @entity5 account - after revealing she had her ' a * * - whipped ' by her lawyer and husband over her latest legal blunder			1
the most recent high - profile error was naming a @entity12 runaway schoolgirl protected by a court order - with her her final tweet revealing the intervention from a lawyer and the @entity17			2
the breach prompted calls for her to ' turn off @entity5 ' to avoid any more legal problems			2
it also appears her account may have been hijacked overnight , as at 2.21am a tweet in broken @entity24 appeared under her name calling her a ' stupid woman '			0
naming the teenager means mrs @entity1 could face a £ 5,000 fine for contempt of court after breaching the order which bans revealing the identity of the girl who allegedly ran away with her teacher to @entity34 this year			1
@entity35 would not confirm if they had received complaints about her tweet , but told @entity38 they ' will actively investigate potential criminal breaches of these restrictions '			1
and her exit from @entity5 comes just a fortnight after she used the site to name former @entity45 treasurer @entity44 following a @entity47 report which alleged a senior @entity45 figure from the @entity50 era was a child abuser			1
he was not named on the programme but was identified quickly online			0
it later emerged that he was the victim of mistaken identity			0
@entity44 , who settled with the @entity55 for £ 185,000 , is now suing mrs @entity1 , although she insists that what she said on @entity5 was ‘ mischievous ’ rather than ‘ libellous ’			1
her latest blunder happened on sunday , when she named the teenage girl on @entity5			1
this tweet has since been deleted			0
she then wrote another message to her 59,000 followers , saying she had been discussing the matter with a friend			0
she had been referring to the case of @entity65 , a 30 - year - old teacher in @entity66 , @entity67 , who was arrested in @entity68 in september and returned to @entity12			0
gone : after several mistakes and calls for her to ' turn off @entity5 ' @entity1 's personal account has been deleted final tweet : in a message to her thousands of followers mrs @entity1 revealed she had a telling off after naming the girl and that she hoped to be back hacked ? : this curious tweet appeared under her name calling her a ' stupid woman ' and saying she had a soft password he was charged with abducting a child and remanded in custody at a court hearing last week			1
the court made a section 39 order under the @entity86 , banning the naming of the teenager			2
the order states : ‘ any publication by whatever media in breach of this order is punishable by a fine in the sum of £ 5,000			1
’ reference : the @entity98 activist was referring to the case of @entity65 , a teacher in @entity66 , who was arrested in @entity68 in september			0
he is pictured in october getting on a plane to return to @entity12 legal action : her gaffe comes just a fortnight after she used @entity5 to name former @entity45 treasurer @entity44 , following a @entity47 report which alleged a senior @entity45 figure was a child abuser legal experts say using a social networking site such as @entity5 to comment does constitute publication , meaning mrs @entity1 , a @entity98 activist , could face a fine			1
@entity112 , a media lawyer with the firm @entity113 , said : ‘ the contempt of court requirements will apply to her just the same as any newspaper or broadcaster			2
i would advise her to be very cautious			0
‘ i would certainly urge her to turn off her @entity5 account at the moment			1
angry : @entity1 was sent a letter from solicitors acting for @entity44 ( pictured in april 1998 ) ‘ she may not know the law , but equally most people who have an understanding of these things know that in respect of actions involving children and things like that , you ca n’t go around naming them			2
i think it is surprising that none of these things seem to cross her radar			0
' the contempt of court requirements will apply to her just the same as any newspaper or broadcaster			2
i would advise her to be very cautious			0
i would certainly urge her to turn off her @entity5 account at the moment ' @entity112 , media lawyer mrs @entity1 ’s agent was contacted last night but did not reply			1

over the weekend , mrs @entity1 used @entity5 to argue that she was being unfairly targeted by @entity44 because she was high profile and a @entity98 supporter			1

‘ and i do n’t do conspiracy theories as a rule			0
’ in another tweet , she declared : ‘ i do n’t have money to contest a multi-millionaire			0
lord @entity160 falsely accused but not by me			0
