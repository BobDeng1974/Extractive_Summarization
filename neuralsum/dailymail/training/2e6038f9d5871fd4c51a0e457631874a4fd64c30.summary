a new study led by the @entity20 has found that both positive and negative human emotions are felt more intensely in bright light			1
@entity23 , assistant professor of management at the university and @entity26 of @entity27 , conducted a series of studies to examine the unusual paradox of lighting and human emotion			0
while other studies have shown that people can be more optimistic about the stock market on sunny days , while gloomy days can result in seasonal affective disorder , professor @entity33 said : ‘ we found that on sunny days depression - prone people actually become more depressed ’			2
to investigate the phenomena , the duo asked experiment participants to rate a wide range of things , such as the spiciness of chicken - wing sauce , the aggressiveness of a fictional character , how attractive someone was and the taste of two juices , under different lighting conditions			0
they found that emotions run higher in bright light , so that sauce tasted hotter , characters felt more aggressive and people looked more attractive , for example			1
the researchers found that emotions run higher in bright light			1
they think this might be because our emotional system perceives sunshine as heat ( illustrated ) which in itself triggers our emotions participants drank more of the delicious - tasting juice and less of the unfavourable juice too , according to the study , which was published in the @entity69			2
