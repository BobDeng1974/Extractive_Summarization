@entity1 's dramatic 2009 move from @entity2 to @entity3 was clinched , agent @entity4 says , when he put up £ 1.2million demanded by the @entity6 club out of his own pocket			1
@entity4 relived perhaps the tightest deal in transfer history , that was finally secured with a one - word email eight seconds from the deadline , while a guest on @entity14 on monday			1
as one of the duller transfer deadline days in recent times played out , @entity4 reached into his extensive vault of football business experience to offer some insight into what was really going behind the scenes amid the speculation about player moves			1
@entity1 's £ 15million move from @entity2 to @entity3 was completed with eight seconds to spare @entity1 is substituted by @entity26 in 2009 ' i was involved with @entity1			1
that deal started in the second week in january , ' he recalled			1
' funnily enough , the guy at the @entity6 end was in charge of the @entity6 national gas company at the time			0
the previous week he 'd cut off the @entity34 's supply and this week he was talking about football deals			0
' @entity4 says discussion were stunted from that point until the deadline was imminent on january 30			1
' we got to the 30th of january , and everyone thought we better hurry up here			0
then it got really serious , ' he said on @entity14			2
so we flew the player over anyway ( @entity44 was in @entity45 and @entity4 , with his brother @entity46 , feared he 'd be stranded there )			2
' it got to the very last day and we were about £ 1.2million apart with about an hour to go			0
and it was literally who blinked , and i sat in the middle of it as the agent			0
' in the end , i offered the @entity6 the extra money			0
and i said to @entity3 i 've done this			2
and we had 30 seconds to go			0
' the drama did n't end there , with the @entity6 unable to fax their approval of the deal through to @entity3			1
although @entity1 scored four against @entity64 early in his career , his time at the @entity63 did n't last ' they had to email it through , and with eight seconds to go the @entity6 came through with the word ' accepted '			2
' and the £ 15million deal was done			1
what came after was n't quite as exciting , with @entity1 starting well with an early four - goal bag against @entity64 but he failed to light up the @entity63 consistently			0
he was eventually sold back to @entity2 in june 2013 having been sent back there on loan with 31 goals in his 143 games for the @entity76 .			0
