the two men assigned to a one - year spaceflight said thursday that their upcoming mission will allow the world to push deeper into space			1
@entity6 astronaut @entity5 and @entity8 cosmonaut @entity7 will rocket into orbit from @entity10 in march and move into the @entity11 for an entire year			1
for @entity6 , it will represent a space endurance record ; for @entity8 , it will fall two months shy of its world record			1
@entity6 astronaut @entity5 ( left ) and @entity8 cosmonaut @entity7			1
@entity5 and @entity7 will rocket into orbit from @entity10 in march , 2015			1
they will spend a year aboard the @entity11			0
at a news conference thursday at @entity18 headquarters in @entity19 , @entity5 and @entity7 said they anticipate many scientific gains from their mission			1
researchers need to know more about the prolonged effects of space on humans , before astronauts embark on @entity32 expeditions lasting three years , round trip , they said			2
' what makes this exciting for me , this one - year flight , is about the science and everything we 're going to learn from expanding the envelope on the space station , ' @entity5 said			1
' if we 're ever going to go to @entity32 someday , the @entity11 is really a great platform to learn much more about having people live and work in space for longer durations			1
it 's close to the @entity48 , and it 's a great orbiting facility			0
' @entity5 and @entity7 have been training for this mission since their selection two years ago			1
both already have spent a half - year aboard the orbiting lab , on separate flights , and have been advised by previous yearlong space fliers to ' pace yourself			1
' it â€™s not just technology that will be an issue with getting to @entity32 ; owing to the orbits of @entity48 and @entity32 there are specific windows of opportunity when a mission can take place			2
our planets come as close to each other as 33.9 million miles ( 54.6 million km ) , but can be as distant as 250 million miles ( 400 million km )			2
for this reason spacecraft to @entity32 , such as the @entity69 , have to launch in certain windows when the planets are aligned			0
the next window is open from january 2016 to april 2016 , and will see the launch of two more missions to the red planet			0
for a future manned mission , they will need to launch out in one of the windows and return in one , which will take two years in total			0
just getting there will take seven or eight months			0
the astronauts will be there waiting for a year until they can come back			0
the 50 - year - old @entity5 , a former @entity86 fighter pilot , said his goals are the same as they are every time he flies in space : ' no one gets hurt , we do n't break anything and we leave as friends			1
' @entity5 noted that his first spaceflight , back in 1999 , lasted eight days			2
at the time , it ' seemed like that was a long time			0
' his second flight , also on a space shuttle , lasted 13 days , and his space station visit in 2010 lasted 159 days			0
' they 're getting longer , ' he told reporters			0
both already have spent a half - year aboard the orbiting lab , on separate flights , and have been advised by previous yearlong space fliers to ' pace yourself			2
' ' i think if i fly again , ' it just goes on forever ' and i never come home			0
' @entity7 , 54 , a former @entity110 paratrooper , said the support of his family has helped him deal with the preparations and the flight itself			2
he had exciting personal news for those tuning in : ' you can congratulate me			0
