a trend we are just starting to get our heads around is the @entity3			0
be it denim , cropped , printed or striped , the wide leg trouser is at the forefront of @entity8 trends			1
there 's something effortless about a wide leg trouser that really appeals			1
and if like us you are growing tired of the skinny jean and want to try out a new look this could be your answer			2
@entity17 says that a wide - leg trouser can come as a welcome relief from the skinny jean skinny jeans have held court for quite a few years now and while they will never go out of style the wide leg will give you an alternative look			1
it 's not the first time this look has made a comeback since the @entity30			0
@entity31 tried the out the trend seven years ago with a @entity33 flared jean - luckily she kept hold of them ! the wide leg can be intimidating , especially if you 're on the shorter side			1
but the key is all in the shoe			0
huge amounts of fabric is hard to look flattering but if you keep your heels high and your top half simple you can pull it off with confidence			0
a high heeled shoe with an exposed top of foot will elongate the leg , a must when wearing a cropped voluminous trouser			2
@entity17 and @entity53 say to avoid being drowned by too much fabric try a high heeled shoe @entity17 recommends pairing a wide - leg with a simple knit to keep the outfit in proportion if going for a longer length go high - waisted and very long to give extra leg length			1
proportion is everything , team with a simple knit , shirt or tee to keep the look current and cool , not costume			0
denim is the easiest way to nail the trend - @entity73 revisited the @entity30 with a collection filled with flared jeans in vintage washes			2
the stylish pair agree that denim is the easiest way to achieve the trend the wide - leg trouser made an appearance on several catwalks including on the runway of @entity8 who showcased a denim take on the trend , for a high street take try the @entity89 jean ( right ) @entity90 showcased colourful billowing bottoms on their @entity8 runway @entity93 meanwhile have been quick to follow suit with their version - the @entity89 - a 1970s - style wide leg flare			1
@entity90 and @entity33 kept it classy with a dressier - style pant , perfect for an evening look			0
try new online label @entity100 for a similar style with a lower price tag			0
a wide billowing trouser silhouette will update your wardrobe this season and the bonus is it 's one spring trend you do n't need nice weather for			2
