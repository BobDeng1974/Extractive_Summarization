by @entity0 women with the potentially cancer - causing human papillomavirus , or @entity4 , may be putting their partners at risk if they share sex toys during intimate relations , a new study suggests			1
researchers gave 12 women two vibrators each and detected the virus immediately after self - use on at least one of the vibrators used by all nine participants who tested positive for @entity4			1
lead author dr. @entity16 , from the @entity17 in @entity18 , said the small study is the first to examine whether vibrators could be transmitting the virus between sex partners			1
spreading the word : women with the potentially cancer - causing human papillomavirus , or @entity4 , may be putting their partners at risk if they share sex toys during intimate relations , a new study suggests ' sex toys used between partners within the same sexual encounter have the potential for transmitting @entity4 , ' @entity27 told @entity0			1
' cleaning the sex toy has the potential to decrease the amount of @entity34 we can detect and so can potentially decrease the risk of transmission			1
' genital hpv is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the @entity39			0
it is so pervasive that it has been called the common cold of the sexually active world			0
@entity4 can be innocuous , but sometimes leads to warts and sometimes to cancer			0
the @entity39 @entity44 ( @entity44 ) estimates the virus causes an estimated 27,000 cervical , vulvar , vaginal , anal , penile , head and neck cancers among @entity39 each year			1
the @entity44 recommends girls get one of two series of vaccines to protect against the type of hpv that causes most cervical cancers			0
despite a push to immunize , less than 54per cent of @entity39 girls between 13 and 17 years old were vaccinated in 2012			0
the @entity44 also recommends that boys get one of the vaccines			0
' it probably would make sense for people not to share their sex toys , i 'm not sure how practical it is during sex to start washing your toys ' current study participants were women between the ages of 18 and 29 who had engaged in sexual relations with both a man and a woman during the prior year			1
@entity27 said she did not know if the participants had been vaccinated against @entity4			0
the investigators gave each woman a cleaning product , one vibrator made of thermoplastic elastomer - known as a ' rabbit ' - style vibrator - and another made of soft silicone			0
they asked participants to swab the vibrators after vaginal use , immediately after cleaning and 24 hours later			1
nine of the participants tested positive for @entity4 , and the virus was detected on at least one of the two vibrators given to each of them			1
just after use , @entity4 was found on all but one of the thermoplastic vibrators and on six of the nine silicone vibrators			1
even after cleaning , the researchers detected dna from @entity4 on five of the thermoplastic vibrators and four of the silicone ones			1
the silicone vibrators responded better to the cleaning after 24 hours			2
the researchers did not detect the virus on any of the silicone vibrators a day after cleaning , but they did find @entity4 on two of the thermoplastic sex toys			1
under the micorscope : genital hpv is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the @entity39 - it can be innocuous , but sometimes leads to warts and sometimes to cancer the difference could be related to the porosity of the material , @entity27 said			0
she noted that the presence of @entity34 does not necessarily indicate the presence of an infection			0
additional studies would be necessary to determine whether an infection could be transmitted through sex toys , she said			2
cleaning vibrators may reduce the frequency of @entity4 transmission , the authors write			2
they call for more research on sex - toy materials , design and cleaning methods to most effectively reduce the virus ' spread			1
once hidden in x-rated novelty shops , sex toys now line the shelves of major stores			2
women also buy the devices at parties formerly reserved for kitchen products			0
' i agree with the author that we need to study and identify safe and effective ways to clean sex toys , ' dr. @entity145 told @entity0			1
he is an infectious disease specialist at the @entity153 , @entity154 and was not involved in the current study			2
' when people are intimate , they 're going to share viruses and germs			0
the good thing is that @entity4 is vaccine - preventable			0
the bad thing is the vaccination rates are very low , ' @entity145 said			0
' it probably would make sense for people not to share their sex toys , ' he said			2
but he added , ' i 'm not sure how practical it is during sex to start washing your toys			2
' dr. @entity173 , from the @entity174 in @entity175 , @entity176 , told @entity0 in an email that doctors should advise patients to clean their sex toys , particularly those shared between both same - sex and heterosexual partners			1
in prior studies , more than half of women between 18 and 60 years old reported using a vibrator , and more than 65per cent of bisexual women reported partnered sex toy use , the current study 's authors write in @entity191			1
the medical community once thought that women who have sex with women were at low risk for @entity4			2
but studies have since shown hpv infections are common among these women			0
@entity200 also suggests some women who have sex with women , particularly adolescents and young women as well as women who have sex with both women and men , may be at increased risk for sexually transmitted infections .			0

new study from the @entity17 is the first to examine whether vibrators could be transmitting the virus between sex partners
