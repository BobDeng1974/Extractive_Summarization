if this is what a dry spell looks like then @entity0 can probably rest easy , but he should not get too comfortable			1
there will be harder days ahead , especially if his side produce many more performances like this one			2
not that it was dreadful			2
how could it be when they won 2 - 0 and did not face a single shot on goal ? but that ’s not to say it was impressive			2
they led through @entity16 inside six minutes and after 10 minutes @entity17 had lost @entity18 to injury			1
it was not until the 67th minute , when @entity21 scored their second goal after @entity24 was shown a red card for a dreadful tackle , that they looked comfortable			1
@entity16 is gifted a free header inside the @entity17 penalty area and heads home @entity31 's opener in the seventh minute hazard seeks out @entity33 ( right ) after his pinpoint cross led to @entity31 's goal in an overall comfortable first half @entity21 broke his four - game barren run by scoring @entity31 's second goal at @entity40 @entity21 ( centre ) acknowledges his teammates after securing a victory that keeps @entity31 three points clear at the top @entity31 : @entity46 7 ; @entity47 7.5 , @entity48 6 , @entity49 8 , @entity50 7 ; @entity51 7 , @entity52 8 , @entity53 7.5 , @entity33 8 , hazard 9 ; costa 8 substitutes : @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 ( for @entity51 82 ) , @entity58 ( for @entity33 78 mins ) , @entity59 ( for @entity53 ) , @entity60 , @entity61 scorers : hazard 7 , @entity21 68 booked : @entity48 , @entity53 , @entity21 @entity17 : @entity63 7 ; @entity64 6 , @entity18 6 , @entity65 6 , @entity66 5 , @entity67 6 , @entity24 4 , @entity68 5 , @entity69 6 , @entity70 5 , @entity71 5 substitutes : @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 ( for @entity76 ) , @entity77 , @entity78 ( for @entity71 ) , @entity79 74 ) , @entity80 scorer : @entity82 booked : @entity24 , @entity68 , @entity64 , @entity75 sent off : @entity24 referee : @entity84 star man : @entity16 see the lead - up to @entity31 's goals , including the second ( above ) from @entity21 in @entity89 's brilliant @entity88 even then there was a lingering ‘ what if ’ , one that was posed so passionately by @entity75 when he weighed up @entity84 ’s odd decision not to book @entity48 for diving in the second half			1
having already been shown a yellow card in the opening period , the @entity97 centre - half was extremely lucky not to be dismissed for his tumble when it was still 11 v 11 and 1 - 0 to @entity31			2
but a win is a win , as they say			0
@entity0 certainly was n’t trumpeting it as anything else , saying : ‘ i have to agree - we have had many special performances this season and in this we just had moments			1
’ this was the sort of day where @entity0 had only pragmatic thoughts			1
when asked why he was snubbed for the manager of the month award , he said : ‘ i promise you that what i tell you is true - i do n't care			2
but there is something that is not right because , in four years in the @entity122 , i 've won the manager of the month twice			0
so , for sure , they do n't like me			0
but i do n't care			0
i just want my team to win			0
’ @entity46 flaps at a cross as the @entity31 keeper makes his first @entity122 start of the season @entity31 defender @entity48 goes through @entity17 's @entity130 in this challenge that landed him in referee @entity84 's book @entity17 keeper @entity63 shows his disappointment after @entity16 headed his eighth goal of the season @entity137 midfielder @entity33 ( centre ) congratulates @entity16 after providing the assist for his goal @entity17 's @entity141 and @entity24 wanted more serious punishment for the foul while @entity48 stayed down after the collision that much they achieved , sweeping away in the process some of the doubting looks that came their way after the club ’s recent struggles in the north - east , either side of a win against @entity155			1
not that four points from three games ought to constitute a crisis when set against @entity17 ’s run of nine games without a win			1
but there are worries for @entity0 , namely what happens when @entity165 is not available			1
his ban for this game was somewhat offset by the return of @entity52 , a wonderfully significant cog in this machine			0
but @entity51 made up the numbers next to @entity52 in front of the defence and the combination simply is not as creative or fluent as when @entity52 and @entity165 play together			0
the tempo is evidently not the same when they are separated			0
perhaps that is why @entity21 was often so subdued when this was still a match between equal numbers			1
he had not scored in his previous four appearances and barely made a dent on @entity17 ’s defence in the first half			1
often , the supply line just was not functioning			0
with due credit to @entity17 , they steadied themselves well after a dreadful start littered with misfortune			1
they were behind after only six minutes and had good cause to appeal for a foul in the build - up to @entity16 ’s headed opener			1
@entity51 had won possession in the middle of the pitch , but replays showed he took more than a bit of @entity130 ’s foot in the process			0
no whistle came , @entity52 spread the play to @entity33 on the left and his excellent cross found @entity16			1
his header meant eight goals this season for a man closing in on a £ 200,000 a week contract			2
@entity17 boss @entity75 speaks with @entity31 's @entity0 as they teams go toe - to - toe at @entity40 @entity17 's @entity213 has @entity52 's arms to contend with as he tries to hold onto the ball in the midfield hazard palms off @entity17 's @entity69 during @entity31 's clash with @entity17 on saturday @entity69 is left standing still as @entity219 ' @entity53 flies high in a challenge at @entity40 @entity17 's @entity24 keeps his feet while @entity33 takes the aerial route to a bouncing ball @entity31 's @entity50 writhes in pain and referee @entity84 brandishes a red card after a studs - up challenge from @entity24 ( not pictured ) @entity24 stands over @entity50 while @entity49 checks on his team - mate , but @entity84 's mind is made up @entity0 said : ‘ he did n't play against @entity233 in midweek			1
i gave him four days holiday			0
he went with his family to a weather where he can take his shirt ( off ) and get some sun. then , in return , he said he 'd come back fresh			0
he came back with that happiness in his legs			0
’ @entity18 then left the pitch after injuring his hamstring and what was already a tough fixture looked far harder			0
somehow , the walloping never happened ; hazard ’s goal was the only shot on target in the half			0
the second half was fairly even until the second of two refereeing incidents			0
first , @entity48 escaped a booking for diving after a @entity68 challenge – he had already been booked for a bad foul on @entity130 - and then @entity24 was sent off for an awful tackle on @entity257 after an hour			1
within seven minutes @entity31 were two up			0
hazard did much of the work , exchanging passes with @entity47 before threading a pass to @entity21 whose slow roll across and past @entity63 was perfect			2
it was a rare moment of class on a scrappy day			0
@entity265 here to @entity268 's facebook page			2
@entity21 lets loose with a right - footed shot to double @entity31 's lead in the second half @entity21 scores his 12th goal of the season after being played in by @entity16 @entity31 celebration the second goal which all but ended @entity17 's afternoon @entity47 ( left ) and @entity52 ( right ) get in on the celebrations after @entity21 hits the back of the net yet again @entity48 refuses to give @entity70 space as the defender challenges the striker in the air			1

@entity16 opened the scoring in the seventh minute with a header from @entity33 's cross
@entity17 's @entity24 was sent off on the hour mark after a studs - up tackle on @entity257
@entity21 scored his first in four games and his 12th for the season when set up by @entity16
the victory keeps @entity0 's side three points clear of @entity297
