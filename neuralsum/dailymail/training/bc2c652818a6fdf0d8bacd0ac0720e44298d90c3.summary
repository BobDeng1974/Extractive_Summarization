at least 15 republicans are contemplating @entity2 presidential runs , and most of them will be wooing donors and seeking blessings of core conservatives this weekend at two crucial events laying groundwork for 2016			1
none of the candidates in waiting has officially launched a @entity14 bid , and the first state - wide vote in the process to determine a party 's nominee is a full 53 weeks away			2
but the competition to earn the imprimatur of conservative groups , far - right voters , and the mega-donors that have become indispensable to @entity2 political success breaks into the open saturday and sunday			2
of saturday 's speakers , no fewer than eight are believed to have their eyes on the @entity14			0
they include senator @entity57 , a thorn in the party establishment 's side ; former @entity63 governor @entity62 , whose 2012 presidential campaign crashed and burned ; @entity49 governor @entity48 , battling sinking poll numbers ; and mild - tempered neurosurgeon @entity40 , a @entity43 favorite			1
each will get 20 minutes to wow the 1,000 - strong crowd -- a sort of political speed - dating session -- and experts say making a good impression at the start of the political cycle is crucial			1
' it is the kickoff , ( and ) will set the tone for many of the contenders , ' @entity76 professor @entity75 told @entity82			0
let the @entity83 : @entity84 stood in the cold as they lined up to enter the @entity32 on saturday an equally if not more influential event takes place sunday in @entity88 , @entity89 , where billionaire industrialists and political powerbrokers @entity90 and @entity91 invited 450 conservative entrepreneurs and donors to their annual winter retreat			0
several 2016 hopefuls will attend , including @entity34 senators @entity57 , @entity99 and @entity100 , who are scheduled to square off in a three - way forum sunday			1
but notably absent in @entity31 are former @entity103 gov. @entity102 , 2012 @entity34 nominee @entity104 and sen. @entity99			1
@entity102 , the son and brother of two presidents , and @entity104 , a two - time candidate himself are viewed as establishment republicans , occupying the political space more to the middle than those headed to @entity31 or @entity89			1
on thursday , @entity102 and @entity104 met privately in @entity113 , in a possible sign of their future intentions			1
the @entity91 network marshals vast funding to advance free - market policies			2
for many @entity34 candidates , being on the right side of that network is essential			2
' whether we like it or not , one of the first primaries in either party is the fundraising primary , and having access to that network helps you , ' @entity34 strategist @entity123 told @entity131			1
the retreat is invitation - only			0
but this year , organizers have taken a new tack , and a webcast will be made available to reporters			0
no compromise : senator @entity57 is a tea party favorite and promises to wow @entity31 conservatives with a small - government message that takes president @entity142 head - on ' oops ' part deux ? @entity63 governor @entity62 is trying to recover from a crash - and - burn 2012 candidacy and may try again in 2016 ' our goal in 2015 is to help inform the national debate around key domestic economic issues , and this forum is the beginning of that conversation , ' said @entity154 spokesman @entity153			1
the @entity91 brothers ' political influence has become profound			0
one organization in the @entity91 network , @entity157 , spent a reported $ 120 million in 2012 opposing @entity142 and congressional @entity160			0
such is the @entity160 antipathy for the @entity162 that when @entity165 @entity34 leaders limited debate in the chamber thursday night , opponents accused them of rushing proceedings to give lawmakers time to get to the retreat			0
' @entity172 fumes have a whiff of @entity91 , ' sneered senior @entity165 @entity160 aide @entity174			0
democrats too have their deep - pocketed donors , which the party 's 2016 hopefuls will court			2
but with all eyes on @entity182 as the prospective frontrunner , the scramble for @entity160 donor backing is less frantic than on the @entity34 side .			0

@entity53 is the first major cattle - call for @entity34 in advance of the 2016 @entity188
the *caucuses* , along with primaries in @entity191 and @entity44 , are a major proving ground for presidential hopefuls
*big* names will get 20 minutes each to woo conservatives in what amounts to a political speed - dating session
notably absent are former @entity103 gov. @entity102 , 2012 @entity34 nominee @entity104 and sen. @entity99
