@entity7 - like features which could be the footprints of the cataclysmic events have been discovered at several sites in the @entity2 northern highlands			1
scientists believe they were left behind by massive volcanic explosions that blasted ash and lava out of the planet 's surface more than three billion years ago			2
@entity2 may once have been rocked by titanic supervolcano eruptions that may have shaped the planet 's climate			2
this image shows an area of @entity2 known as @entity19 looking which is a 70 - kilometre wide caldera formed by formed by the collapse of land			2
scientists believe the collapse may have followed a supervolcanic eruption supervolcano eruptions are thousands of times stronger than those of ordinary volcanoes , and powerful enough to alter global climate and cause mass extinctions			1
they have occurred in @entity34 's past , and a plugged supervolcano is said to be simmering beneath @entity36 in the @entity37 today			0
rather than producing typical conical mountains of lava and ash , supervolcanoes erupt suddenly in huge explosions			2
because they do not build mountains , evidence of ancient supervolcanoes can be hard to detect			2
but scientists think they may have formed a series of irregularly shaped craters in an area of @entity2 known as @entity51			1
if future work shows that supervolcanoes were present more widely on ancient @entity2 , it would completely change estimates of how the atmosphere formed from volcanic gases , how sediments formed from volcanic ash and how habitable the surface might have been a volcano becomes a ' supervolcano ' if it erupts more than 1,000 cubic kilometres of magma			1
their eruptions are thousands of times stronger than those of ordinary volcanoes , and powerful enough to alter global climate and cause mass extinctions			1
supervolcanos occur when magma in the mantle rises into the crust from but is unable to break through			0
pressure builds in a large and growing magma pool until the crust is unable to contain it			0
@entity36 is one example of a supervolcano on @entity34			0
the last eruption was 630,000 years ago , and was 1,000 times bigger than the @entity82 eruption in 1980			0
the ancient , crater - pockmarked region is covered by layers of fine - grained material of unknown origin that could have been left by explosive eruptions			0
one of the best examples of what might be a supervolcano remnant is @entity19 , a depression in the @entity2 surface 85km wide and 1.8km deep			1
it is linked to at least three other depressions in what scientists describe as a ‘ caldera complex ’			0
other supervolcano candidates include the 700 metre - deep @entity99 , and @entity100 , a nest of deep craters extending up to 1,750 metres below the surrounding plains			0
the volcanoes may have produced powdery deposits identified by @entity107 rovers at two landing sites , @entity109 and @entity110			0
many @entity2 volcanoes are easily recognised from their massive shield - shaped structure , similar to what we see in @entity115			1
' but these are relatively youthful features on @entity2 and we have always wondered where the ancient volcanoes are , ' said dr @entity120 , from the @entity121 gases released by the eruptions would have altered the @entity2 climate , according to the scientists writing in the journal @entity127			1
‘ discovering supervolcanic structures fundamentally changes how we view ancient volcanism on @entity2 , ’ said lead researcher dr @entity120 , from the @entity121			2
‘ @entity131 volcanoes are easily recognised from their massive shield - shaped structure , similar to what we see in @entity115			0
‘ but these are relatively youthful features on @entity2 and we have always wondered where the ancient volcanoes are			1
‘ it is possible that the most ancient volcanoes were much more explosive and formed structures similar to what we now see in @entity51			0
’ he added : ‘ it makes sense that supervolcanoes might have been more common on ancient @entity2 , particularly if the ancient crust was thinner than it is now			1
‘ this would allow magma to rise to the surface more quickly , before it could release gases within the crust			0
‘ if future work shows that supervolcanoes were present more widely on ancient @entity2 , it would completely change estimates of how the atmosphere formed from volcanic gases , how sediments formed from volcanic ash and how habitable the surface might have been			1

supervolcanoes are 1000s of times stronger than ordinary volcanoes
evidence of them has been found in craters on @entity2 ' northern highlands
finding could change estimates of how habitable surface may have been
