the open enrollment period for federal @entity2 plans will begin more than a month later than it did last year , with this year 's start date coming after the midterm elections			1
in 2013 consumers could begin signing up for plans on oct. 1			1
this year they were scheduled to start their applications on oct. 15			1
but the @entity9 administration announced late last year that the second enrollment period would instead begin on nov. 15 - a full week and a half after the consequential federal elections taking place on nov. 4			1
both the @entity14 and the @entity15 have said politics are n't at play			2
the enrollment date was delayed this year to give insurers more time to calculate rates and consumers more time to familiarize themselves with healthcare plans available to them , they 've said			1
a man receives information about health insurance options last friday in @entity27 , @entity28			0
@entity29 enrolling in @entity2 through the federal exchanges have a month and a half longer to review their options this year than they did last year still , the move has the added convenience of allowing insurers to keep next year 's rates a secret until voters have already cast their ballots for or against @entity40 who voted for or support the health care law			1
at a news briefing last fall , then - @entity14 press @entity43 confirmed the postponement of the fiscal year 2015 and denied that the timing of the midterm elections factored into the @entity51 ' decision			1
' the fact is , we 're doing it because it make sense for insurers to have as clear a sense of the pool of consumers they gain in the market this year , before setting rates for next year , ' the @entity14 spokesman said			1
@entity63 is the division of @entity15 that is responsible for implementing the health care law			0
an @entity15 official told @entity66 at the time of the announcement that the purpose of the revised enrollment schedule was to give insurers ' the benefit of more time to evaluate their experiences during the 2014 plan year , ' particularly after glitches with healthcare.gov caused numerous delays in the first enrollment period			1
the government was supposed to cut consumers off on march 31 but ended up allowing them to sign up for coverage well into april			2
@entity66 's @entity15 source tried to frame the fall 2014 delay as ' good news for consumers ' because they ' will have more time to learn about plans before enrolling			2
' however , republicans are crying foul			0
the way they see it , the administration is purposefully trying keep the true costs of @entity2 from @entity29 until after november 's congressional elections			2
' if premiums go through the roof in the first year of @entity2 , no one will know about it until after the election , ' @entity92 sen. @entity92 said when @entity63 announced the postponement a year ago			0
the federal health care site has been under construction since the last open enrollment period for @entity2 ended in april			2
among the changes to the site is a simplified application that only asks customers 16 pages of questions instead of 76			0
glitches that caused the site to crash during peak traffic times have also been resolved , @entity15 told the @entity112 , and more than 125,000 people will be able to access the site at the same time			0
the next open enrollment period begins on nov. 15			1
the @entity116 expects roughly 13 million @entity29 to sign up for @entity2 in fiscal year 2015 , up from the eight million people who signed up last year			1
in a statement released last friday @entity120 president @entity119 claimed , ' the president sold @entity2 to the @entity29 people on the false promise that it would make health care more accessible and more affordable for those who needed it most			0
' sadly , @entity2 has actually put affordable health care even further out of reach for millions of @entity29 , ' the conservative non-profit head @entity129 administration â€™s decision to withhold the costs of this law until after @entity133 is just more proof that @entity2 is a bad deal for @entity29			0
' @entity2 continues to be unpopular with many @entity29 , and @entity40 should be concerned , if they already are not , that @entity29 facing sticker shock on their health care plans could take their anger out at the ballot box			0
@entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 are all set to see premium hikes next year , and the @entity40 senators representing all three states are in danger of being knocked off by their @entity148 challengers			0
in @entity140 two insurers , @entity149 and @entity150 , are planning double - digit rate increases , according to the @entity152			0
the @entity152 reports that 88 percent of @entity140 wo n't be dramatically effected by the rate hike because they qualify for government subsidies			0
however that has n't stopped the @entity148 candidate in the state 's senate race , @entity159 , from using the news as a cudgel against incumbent sen. @entity162 , a @entity163 who voted for @entity2			2
' did you lose your coverage due to @entity2 ? are your premiums set to skyrocket ? follow the link to share your @entity2 story and stand up to the elected leaders in @entity170 who sold @entity140 out , ' @entity159 said in a @entity172 post on sept. 12			0
while @entity2 has taken a backseat to other prominent issues in this year 's elections such as immigration , jobs and the economy and the war against the @entity182 , @entity148 @entity174 candidates in @entity141 and @entity142 have also made the health care reform law a central issue in their campaigns			2
@entity63 did n't immediately reply to a request for comment from @entity188 on @entity148 's accusations that the 2015 enrollment period was pushed back for political reasons .			1

in 2013 consumers could begin signing up for plans on oct. 1 ; this year they were scheduled to start their applications on oct. 15 .
the @entity9 administration delayed the fiscal year 2015 enrollment period to a week and a half after the federal elections taking place on nov. 4
the @entity14 and the @entity203 have said politics are n't at play
but the move has the convenience of allowing insurers to keep next year 's rates a secret until after voters have cast their ballots
