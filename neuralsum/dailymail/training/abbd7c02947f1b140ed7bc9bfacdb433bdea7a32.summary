the $ 11 billion merger would create the world 's largest airline , after four other major @entity14 carriers combined in recent years , narrowing the field of large @entity14 airlines			1
the antitrust lawsuit , filed in @entity18 and joined by several states including @entity20 and @entity21 , drew concern from industry experts and support from consumer advocates			2
the @entity1 has challenged a proposed $ 11 billion merger between @entity5 and @entity4 ' parent company , @entity3 @entity5 fell 8.4 percent at $ 17.23			1
@entity14 shares , which are thinly traded , were down 44.5 percent at $ 3.22			2
the @entity1 seeks to block the merger ' because it would eliminate competition between @entity5 and @entity14 and put consumers at risk of higher prices and reduced service , ' @entity28 , head of the @entity29 , said in a statement			1
' both airlines have stated they can succeed on a standalone basis , and consumers deserve the benefit of that continuing competitive dynamic , ' @entity28 said			0

but industry experts said the move was out of step with past practices and would potentially leave @entity72 and @entity14 , which is emerging from bankruptcy , at a competitive disadvantage			0
' this borders on shocking , ' said @entity76 , an aviation consultant in @entity77 , @entity64			0
he called the suit ' marvelously inconsistent , ' considering the approval of mergers between @entity81 and @entity82 , and @entity83 and @entity84			0

consumer advocate @entity93 , director of the @entity95 and a vocal opponent of the merger , said he was elated that the @entity1 had filed suit			2
' this is a stake in the heart of the merger			0
i do n't see this moving forward , ' @entity93 said			0
' this is the best possible and the only good consumer outcome that we could have gotten			0
' while @entity14 discussions had centered on remedies such as slot divestitures at @entity62 , @entity93 said , ' in my meetings with @entity1 and in my testimony before @entity112 , i have constantly said that that wo n't take care of the overriding nationwide loss of competition that we 're going to face			2
it sounds like the @entity1 has agreed with me			0
