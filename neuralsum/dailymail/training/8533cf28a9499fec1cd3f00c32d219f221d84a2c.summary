@entity0 is more unpopular than ever , a new poll finds , just as the state and federal health exchanges central to the health care reform law reopen for business			1
americans looking to purchase health insurance for the upcoming year through the health care marketplace could do so beginning on saturday			1
a @entity11 poll released this morning shows that many are none too happy about , however , with just 37 percent of survey - takers saying they approved of the law requiring them to purchase health insurance or be fined by the government if they are not already insured by their employer			1
but @entity11 's latest poll shows perceptions of @entity0 steadily turning negative since this summer after briefly ticking upward earlier this year , and disapproval of the president 's signature law now stands at a peak 56 percent			1
the negative survey follows reports from independent analysts that many of the 7 million @entity7 who participated in the health exchanges last year and plan to re-enroll this year will have to change plans if they do n't want to see their premiums increase			1
according to @entity46 's @entity45 , premiums will rise on average 3.5 percent in 2015 , though enrollees in some states could significantly lower premiums than before while others see wildly higher costs			0
@entity52 in @entity53 have pointed to the increased costs as a key reason to gut the health care reform law , passed in 2010 when @entity57 ruled the roost , and start from scratch			1
the @entity0 is anything but affordable , they have said , and @entity7 would be better off without it			0
many @entity52 who won midterm elections made @entity0 repeal a central theme of their campaigns , and the @entity52 has said one of their first acts in the new legislative session will be to call a vote on the issue			2
as of january , the @entity52 will control both the @entity69 and the @entity70 and will therefore be able to bring legislation undoing the law to the floor			2
republicans will hold a maximum of 54 seats in the @entity70 if they win a runoff election in @entity78 next month , however , putting them far short of the 67 votes they would need to overcome president @entity82 's inevitable veto of the repeal legislation			0
recognizing that repeal is politically impractical , they have vowed to chip away at the law wherever possible until they receive the power to strip it entirely			2
@entity0 approval hit a new low today , according to @entity11 's latest survey meanwhile , a news report released this morning that coincides with the start of the second round of @entity0 enrollments claims that many of the positive comments posted throughout the last two years on a @entity96 facebook page operated by the president 's allies were created by the same core group of users trying to tip the scales of the debate toward their side of the issue			1
according to the @entity109 , 60 percent of the 226,838 comments posted on @entity108 's @entity107 between september 2012 and october 2014 were created by fewer than 100 unique @entity111 users - some of whom used multiple aliases to spread their message			1
one @entity117 woman who supports the law , @entity119 , used four different @entity111 accounts to post an average of 59 flatting comments about the law a day over a 60 - day period , making her the top commenter for those two months			0
@entity125 told the @entity109 she was not paid to post on the site , but its analysis of her posts shows that she only posted on the site during traditional work hours and never on weekends			0
that was also the case for the other top 25 posters to the page , the @entity109 found			0
another woman named @entity137 who lives in @entity138 wrote 4,695 adulatory posts throughout the two - year period the @entity109 ' analysts reviewed , though @entity141 told the news publication that posts from other accounts in her name were not written by her and were instead meant to mock her zealous advocacy of the law			0
despite living outside the country , @entity141 says she too was not paid for her posts			0
rather she said is just strongly supportive of health care overhaul in the @entity7 the managers of the page declined to return the @entity109 ' request for confirmation that the @entity0 advocates were not being paid to promote the law			1
at least one of the prolific posters , a retired veteran named @entity157 who lives in @entity158 , was protesting the law on the page , the @entity109 also found			2
@entity157 wrote 2,316 anti-obamacare posts in 60 days and was the second highest commenter during that period , just behind @entity125			0
he told the @entity109 he 's made it his full - time job to post on the page and ' rid it of misinformation			0
