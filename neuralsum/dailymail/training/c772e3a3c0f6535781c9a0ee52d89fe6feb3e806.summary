scientists have confirmed that 15 pounds of meteorite from @entity2 fell in @entity3 last july			1
it is only the fifth time in history scientists have chemically confirmed @entity2 meteorites that people witnessed falling			2
the last shower that was found ' fresh ' - and thus uncontaminated by @entity11 chemicals - was in 1962			1
the rocks are incredibly valuable - 10 times more precious than gold - because no @entity2 rover or lander has yet returned @entity2 material to @entity11			1
the only source for @entity2 rock is these showers			1
a @entity2 meteorite recovered in december 2011 near @entity21 , @entity3 following a meteorite shower believed to have occurred in july 2011 the meteorites could be crucial to our search for life on @entity2			1
the fireball was spotted in the sky six months ago , but the rocks were n’t discovered on the ground in @entity31 until the end of december			0
scientists and collectors of meteorites are ecstatic , and already the rocks are fetching huge sums			0
a special committee of meteorite experts , including some @entity41 scientists , confirmed the test results tuesday			2
they certified that 15 pounds of meteorite recently collected came from @entity2			2
the biggest rock weighs over 2 pounds			0
all the known @entity2 rocks on @entity11 add up to less than 240 pounds			2
the surface of @entity2 : scientists believe that the meteorites came from an ancient impact on the planet astronomers think millions of years ago something big smashed into @entity2 and sent rocks hurtling through the solar system			2
after a long journey through space , one of those rocks plunged through @entity11 ’s atmosphere , splitting into smaller pieces			0
most other @entity2 meteorite samples sat around on @entity11 for millions of years - or at the very least decades - before they were discovered , which makes them tainted with @entity11 materials and life			1
these new rocks are purer			0
the last time a @entity2 meteorite fell and was found fresh was in 1962			1
most of the @entity2 rocks on @entity11 have been around for centuries or longer and have been found in @entity70 or the desert			1
they look so similar to dark @entity11 rocks that if they fell in other places , such as @entity77 , they would blend right in and never be discovered , @entity72 said			0
scientists can tell they are @entity2 , because as @entity2 is more geologically active , its rocks tend to be much younger - millions of years old instead of hundreds of millions or more - than those from the moon or asteroids			1
the meteorites were scooped up by dealers and sold on - fetching huge sums as material from @entity2 is so rare			1
the total amount of @entity2 rock on @entity11 is 240lb the new samples were scooped up by dealers from those who found them			1
even before the official certification , scientists at @entity41 , museums and universities scrambled to buy or trade these meteorites			2
' it ’s a free sample from @entity2			2
that ’s what these are , except you have to pay the dealers for it , ' said @entity107 meteorite expert @entity106 , who heads the committee that certified the discovery			0
he has already bought a chunk of meteorite and said he was thrilled just to hold it , calling the rock ' really spectacular			0
' one of the key decisions the scientists made tuesday was to officially connect these rocks to the fiery plunge witnessed by people and captured on video last summer			0
the announcement and the naming of these meteorites - called @entity122 - came from the @entity123 , which is the official group of 950 scientists that confirms and names meteorites			0
meteorite dealer @entity126 , who sold a chunk to @entity129 , said he charges $ 11,000 to $ 22,500 an ounce and has sold most of his supply already			0
at that price , the new @entity2 rock costs about 10 times more than gold			1
' it ’s scientifically invaluable , ' @entity106 said			0
' these are really beautiful specimens			0
it ’s a rare type , so fresh and aesthetically pleasing			0
' because known @entity2 meteorite falls happen only once every 50 years or so - 1815 in @entity140 , 1865 in @entity141 , 1911 in @entity142 and 1962 in @entity143 - this is a once - in - a - career or even one - in - a - lifetime event .			1

rare shower is first found ' fresh ' since 1962
could be crucial for search for life on @entity2
only source for @entity2 rock - no @entity41 mission has returned any
rocks fetch 10 times the price of gold
