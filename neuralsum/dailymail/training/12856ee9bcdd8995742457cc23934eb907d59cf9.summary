by @entity0 published : 06:35 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 20:17 est , 20 november 2012 @entity1 is to ask police to investigate @entity4 users who made ‘ malicious communications ’ against him			1
the @entity8 peer plans to make a formal complaint today against potentially thousands who falsely named him as a paedophile – but who have failed to ‘ repent ’ for their actions			1
up to 10,000 @entity4 users are thought to have tweeted about the former @entity8 treasurer ’s alleged – but subsequently disproved – involvement in child abuse			1
lawyers said the @entity1 , pictured , case could potentially involve the largest number of defendants in @entity24 legal history			1
it is unclear how many have now apologised and agreed to pay a nominal sum as requested to @entity27 , but two days ago just 40 had done so			0
the police complaint could lead to a mass prosecution , leading to fines , or even imprisonment for up to six months , and criminal records for the large numbers who wrote about the peer online			0
the inquiry is the latest escalation of the affair which began when the @entity41 flagship @entity39 commissioned research into claims that a senior @entity8 was involved in child abuse at a children ’s home in @entity47			2
the alleged victim later withdrew his claim , leading to the resignation of the @entity41 director general @entity51			0
the @entity41 has already settled with the peer for £ 185,000			0
@entity1 is also understood to be seeking up to £ 500,000 in damages from @entity54 after this morning presenter @entity55 showed a list of alleged @entity8 paedophiles to @entity58			1
now the peer ’s lawyers are believed to have identified 1,000 people who sent their own tweets implying or directly saying he was a paedophile – and a further 9,000 who ‘ retweeted ’ the claims to others			1
among those potentially involved are comedian @entity68 , who tweeted about ‘ this @entity8 paedophile ’ , and then named @entity1 , to his 440,000 followers			1
@entity72 columnist @entity71 also tweeted about the peer			2
@entity41 controversy : @entity1 announced last week that he is taking landmark legal action against internet gossips who falsely branded him a paedophile after @entity41 's @entity39 broadcast the wrong claims mistake : @entity80 took to @entity4 to comment on speculation as to the identity of the @entity8 at the centre of a @entity39 investigation and could be sued @entity1 ’s legal team claim that the offending tweets are criminal offences under the @entity88 1988 , or alternatively under the @entity89 ’s prohibition against ‘ improper use of a public electronic communications network ’			1
earlier this month , nine people were prosecuted for circulating on @entity94 and @entity4 the name of a woman raped by a footballer			0
each defendant was ordered to pay the rape victim £ 624 in damages			0
@entity80 , wife of commons speaker @entity101 , is among those accused of revealing @entity1 ’s name after tweeting : ‘ why is @entity1 trending ? * innocent face * ’			2
this week she blundered again by tweeting the name of a schoolgirl who ran away to @entity107 with her teacher , risking a £ 5,000 fine for contempt of court			0
yesterday mrs @entity80 ’s @entity4 account suddenly disappeared			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

@entity1 's lawyers have found 1,000 *original* tweets and 9,000 retweets
@entity68 and @entity80 among thousands who could be sued in what is thought to involve the largest number of defendants in @entity24 legal history
some @entity4 users who tweeted the @entity8 peer 's name have apologised
