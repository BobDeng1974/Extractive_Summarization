long before @entity1 , @entity2 and even @entity3 , there was only one woman for @entity2 and that lady was @entity2			1
in monday 's episode of made in @entity7 , @entity2 even declared that he has never liked anyone as much as @entity2 , with whom he had a tumultuous and well - documented relationship spanning two seasons of the reality show			1
but after her on - off affair with @entity14 's resident lothario took a turbulent turn for the worse , @entity2 packed her @entity17 bags and jetted out of @entity18 for the bright lights of @entity20			1
since her time at @entity32 in @entity33 , she has lost 10in overall from her body now though , with @entity2 's new season well under way , it seems that 24 - year - old @entity2 is back on home turf and keen to remind viewers exactly what @entity2 saw in her			1
the original made in @entity7 ‘ it ’ girl has dropped 7lbs in under a week following a gruelling diet and exercise regime at boot camp in @entity33 - and she 's happy to show off the results			1
speaking to @entity49 , the fashion designer and reality tv star said : ' i 've lost 10in all over , which is pretty good			0
i feel really good but i find it hard to sleep because i 'm so alert from all the exercise			0
' i really enjoyed it because i like discipline being enforced on me			0
' @entity2 is especially impressed with the results to her derrière , which she claims is the hardest it ’s ever been			1
she giggles : ' if you slap it , there ’s barely a wobble now ! ' tough times : the bootcamp in @entity33 saw @entity2 crawling through mud and eating smaller portions - she says she loves being disciplined and will try her best to keep up the regime ( apart from the mud ! ) thanks to the hardcore training - which includes mud - wrestling , early - morning cardio , hiking and yoga - the 24 year old also toned up her tricky middle section , ' the muffin top … like most women , i think , that ’s where extra weight goes first			1
the tummy and hips ! it ’s also the hardest to shift , ' she said			0
' i ’m not exactly big , so ca n’t quite believe that i ’ve lost seven pounds			0
' @entity2 was , however , horrified to see that her food portions were out of control			1
' i am a real foodie , i have an unhealthy habit with eating and i could easily have eaten three times the amount we were served , ' she admits			0
' but it ’s about waiting a while to see whether you ’re full			0
i normally eat pretty healthily anyway , but i would usually have more carbs at home			0
i work out five days a week and do running , yoga and pilates			0
@entity2 - who earlier this year was linked to @entity98 's cheating ex @entity97 - also spotted benefits to her face			1
' my eyes are much brighter ! ' friends in high places : @entity2 and @entity2 have remained good friends since leaving the @entity14 show that propelled them to fame ; @entity2 even attended @entity2 's wedding to professor @entity108 ' i ’m now looking forward to a facial and beautifying myself a bit , which is a great boost as i 'm off to @entity111 for various acting meetings			1
' i ’m pretty good at disciplining myself if i gain a little so i ’ve never had a weight issue			0
but i ’m looking forward to pulling on my black bandage dress			2
it ’s pretty unforgiving anyway but you have to be small to get in it			0
' i ’m going to stick to a 5:2 plan - be strict for five days then do and eat what the hell i feel like the other two			0
' as well as working on her figure at @entity32 , @entity2 has been in @entity111 , where she 's attended meetings about acting opportunities			1
she has also been focusing on her fashion range , @entity125 ( ' it starts with an idea ' ) , which is similar to @entity129 and sells garments from up - and - coming labels , as well as those designed by @entity2 herself			2
' @entity125 has been taking up a lot of my time but i 'm excited for the future of it because i think it has real potential , ' she said the former reality tv star will be spending the weekend celebrating her 25th birthday with the help of co-stars @entity2 and , you guessed it , @entity2			1
former flame : @entity2 and @entity2 had an on - off relationship on the show and he recently revealed that he 's never liked anyone as much as her			2
sorry , @entity148 - @entity2 is seeing someone else now			2
. fashion face : @entity2 has also created her own version of @entity129 - a hub where she sells up - and - coming designers ' clothes , as well as creations she has worked on herself			2
the 24 - year - old says she sees ' real potential ' for the site but sadly for @entity2 , @entity2 is seeing someone			2
' @entity2 is relentless ! , ' she laughs when asked about his undying affection			1
however , there could be hope as @entity2 reveals she would ' never say never ' to returning to the @entity14 show that sky - rocketed her to fame			2
' my return to made in @entity7 depends on what happens in @entity111 , ' she muses			1
' i do feel like i have left it behind though and that it would be closing doors			0
' i considered a cameo appearance in the @entity20 episode but had other , better opportunities come up at the same time - however , i 'd never say never			0
