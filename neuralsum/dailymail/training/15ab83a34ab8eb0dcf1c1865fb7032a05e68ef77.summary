in a scathing attack on the $ 40 million settlement handed down to the @entity3 5 - at the expense of taxpayers - @entity2 has called the payout a ' disgraceful ' and ' ridiculous ' result owing to the ' incompetence ' of the @entity10 justice system			1
writing an opinion piece for the @entity18 on saturday , the real estate mogul - who has long advocated the five then - teenagers receive the death penalty for the brutal rape and bashing of an investment banker in @entity3 in 1989 - said that even though the men had been exonerated , the $ 40 million settlement was overblown			1
' forty million dollars is a lot of money for the taxpayers of @entity10 to pay when we are already the highest taxed city and state in the country , ' he wrote in the paper			2
' the recipients must be laughing out loud at the stupidity of the city ... these young men do not exactly have the pasts of angels			1
' the five black and @entity35 defendants - @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 - were aged between 14 and 16 when they found guilty in 1990 for the horrific attack on @entity38 , 28 , who had gone for a run in the park			1
settlement : ( left to right ) @entity40 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity39 , and @entity38 in 2012 in @entity10			1
the men have settled for $ 40 million for their wrongful conviction for the rape of a 28 - year - old woman in @entity3 in 1989			1
@entity2 has called the payout ' a disgrace ' she was found in brush with a serious head injury , having lost 75 percent of the blood from her body and with no recollection of what happened			1
scathing : @entity2 says the $ 40 million @entity3 5 settlement is ' disgraceful ' and shows the ' stupidity of the city ' alleged police brutality forced false confessions from the five teens			1
they served six to 13 years in prison before their convictions were thrown out in 2002 because dna evidence that was dug up showed @entity38 , a convicted killer and rapist , had committed the crime and acted alone			1
at the time of their trial , the men argued the @entity68 would have triggered a not - guilty verdict but that the evidence was ignored			1
@entity77 , already in prison for other charges , admitted to attacking @entity38 , who was in a coma for 12 days and suffered permanent damage			1
the five sued police and prosecutors for $ 250 million			2
on friday , 25 years after the attack , the city agreed to give the five a settlement ' in the ball park ' of $ 40 million , which was seen as a symbol of the failure of the justice system			1
' my opinion on the settlement of the @entity38 case is that it ’s a disgrace , ' @entity2 wrote in his piece			1
' a detective close to the case , and who has followed it since 1989 , calls it “ the heist of the century ''			0
' ' one thing we know is that the amount of time , energy and money that has been spent on this case is unacceptable			2
' the justice system has a lot to answer for , as does the @entity10 regarding this very mishandled disaster			1
' ' as citizens and taxpayers , we deserve better than this			0
' the agreed deal , which must still be approved by the city comptroller , averages out at roughly $ 1 million for each year of imprisonment for the five men			1
that means that @entity40 , who spent 13 - years in prison , will be the largest single payout @entity10 has made in a wrongful conviction case			1
the other four men all served around seven years in prison			2
the men are all in their late 30s or early 40s now and @entity10 mayor @entity124 was said to be keen to have the case settled			1
this was in direct contrast to former mayor @entity128 who argued the original $ 250 million suit was too high because authorities acted in good faith			2
arrest : in this april 22 , 1989 file photo , @entity38 , 15 , second from left , and @entity39 , 14 , right , are led from the 24th precinct by a detective after their arrest in connection with the rape and severe beating of a woman jogging in @entity3 @entity38 , second right , is escorted by police in @entity10 in 1990 after being convicted of raping a white woman in @entity3			1
@entity10 has agreed to a $ 40 million settlement in a civil rights lawsuit filed against police and prosecutors by @entity147 and four co-defendants @entity149 , left , whose son @entity40 was one of five youths convicted in the 1989 @entity3 jogger case , pumps her fist in the air as she sings we shall overcome at a rally in front of @entity158 in @entity10 on october 21 , 2002 indeed , according to the @entity161 , the city 's @entity159 backed this opinion at the time			1
' the case is not about whether the teens were wrongly convicted , ' a department spokeswoman said			0
' it ’s about whether prosecutors and police deliberately engaged in misconduct			0
' the attack on 28 - year - old investment banker @entity38 occurred on april 19 , 1989			1
it was one of the most notorious crimes in @entity10 history and it mesmerized the nation , serving as a lurid symbol of the city 's racial and class divide and its rampant crime			2
it gave rise to the term ' wilding ' for urban mayhem by teenagers			0
@entity10 was just crime central at that time , ' said former @entity10 detective @entity189 , recalling an era so blood - soaked that the city had a record 2,245 homicides in 1990 , compared with 414 in 2012			2
' you were scared to ride the trains after dark			0
it was such a different place			0
' @entity38 was out jogging in @entity3 on april 19 , 1989 , when she was bound , gagged , raped and beaten nearly to death , a chilling crime to which five teenage boys confessed after hours of interrogation by @entity10 police			1
from the start , the rape of a 28 - year - old white woman in the park drew intense media coverage and led to the term ' wilding ' to describe gangs of youths terrorizing random passersby			1
the five were convicted in 1990 based on the confessions , delivered after interrogations that in some cases lasted overnight			2
twelve years later , @entity38 , a murderer and serial rapist who had attacked a woman in the park two days before @entity223 's assault , confessed to the crime , and dna testing tied him to the rape			1
in a 2002 report recommending the convictions be vacated , prosecutor @entity227 concluded that the boys ' confessions contained ' troubling discrepancies ' and that @entity77 ' description of the attack matched the crime scene			2
a judge vacated the convictions			0
by then , however , the boys had already been released after serving sentences ranging from five years to 13 years			1
in 2002 , @entity240 commissioner @entity239 appointed a panel to produce its own report , which concluded that the boys likely attacked @entity223 before @entity77 did			2
former prosecutor @entity243 , who co-authored the report , said @entity245 erred in dismissing the boys ' confessions entirely			0
' it seems impossible to say that they were n't there at all , because they knew too much , ' he said in an interview			0
lawyers for the plaintiffs said the belief that the boys are guilty is pervasive among the dozens of police officers who have been deposed			0
' they protect each other , ' said @entity259 , a lawyer for the five			0
' it 's always like this			0
' however , in prison , three of the men , @entity37 , @entity263 and @entity264 said they were innocent but acknowledged they were in the park committing assualts - but not rape			1
mr. @entity39 indicated in his hearing that the larger group was out to rob people			2
' i took part in with the beatings of that man , ' he said			0
' if i could go back in time and not do it again , you know , it would have been a whole different story			0
' the men ’s lawyers have long said that their clients committed no crimes in the park that night			0
when @entity223 was found in the brush , more than 75 percent of her blood had drained from her body and her skull was smashed			0
she was in a coma for 12 days , left with permanent damage , and remembers nothing about the attack			0
@entity223 later went public as a motivational speaker and wrote a book			0
@entity39 and @entity37 , both 14 at the time , @entity36 and @entity147 , 15 , and @entity40 , 16 , were rounded up and arrested			1
after hours of interrogation , four of them recorded confessions on video , in some cases with the boys ' parents in the room			0
bravery : @entity38 , the @entity38 published a book about her harrowing experience - waiving her anonymity to reveal her recovery and the trauma she experienced at the trials , their lawyers argued the confessions were coerced			1
at the time , dna testing was not sophisticated enough to make or break the case			0
in 2002 , a re-examination of the case found that dna on the victim 's sock pointed to @entity38 , a murderer and serial rapist who confessed that he alone attacked the jogger			1
then - district attorney @entity324 stopped short of declaring the @entity325 innocent but withdrew all charges and did not seek a retrial			0
( the statute of limitations for charging @entity77 had run out ; he is serving a life sentence for other crimes			0
) @entity332 , one of the lawyers for the five , said the dna was the key			0
' there was never any forensic evidence that tied them to this case , ' he said			0
' in 1989 , everybody might not have been forensic savvy , but now , after ' @entity341 , ' everybody knows if there 's no dna , they did n't do it			2
' but an overturned conviction does not automatically mean there was any wrongdoing by prosecutors or police			0
legal experts said the case took a long time in part because of the money and reputations at stake			0
the two - hour documentary , ' the @entity325 , ' made the case that the men were wrongly convicted			2
the film uses extensive interviews with the men and their families , and lawyers for the city went to court to demand outtakes for use in the civil case			0
the defendants ' lives since they got out of prison have not been easy			0
@entity39 sold drugs and was sent back to prison , but now , along with @entity37 and @entity263 , has become the public face of the case , speaking out against wrongful convictions and racial profiling			1
' we are over being angry			0
now it 's about helping others , raising our own families right , ' said @entity39 , now 39 last year .			2

@entity3 5 - @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 - settled for $ 40 million on friday , 25 - years after being convicted of a crime they did n't commit
@entity2 says the payout is ' a disgrace ' and shows ' the stupidity of the justice system '
said taxpayers should not have to foot the bill and that the then - teenagers where ' no angels ' at the time of their conviction
they were found guilty of the april 1989 rape and beating of 28 - year - old investment banker @entity38
@entity3 5 were all aged between 14 - 16 and claimed the @entity240 coerced them into confessions
in 2002 new dna evidence discovered a convicted rapist was *responsible*
he confessed and the men were exonerated of the brutal crime after serving between seven and 13 years behind bars
the men , now in their late 30s and early 40s , have spent 12 years fighting for *compensation*
