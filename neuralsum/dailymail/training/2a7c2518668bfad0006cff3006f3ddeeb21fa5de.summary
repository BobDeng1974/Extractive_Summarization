ministers are to force all @entity8 trusts to publish lists of any new treatments they are refusing to give patients – even though they have been approved by the health watchdog @entity13			1
under the plans – which will be rolled out this @entity17 – trusts will also have to explain to the public why these drugs are not yet available			1
@entity20 plans : patients will soon be able to find out whether their gp or hospital is rationing drugs to save money the government hopes the scheme will end the so - called postcode lottery of @entity8 treatment whereby a patient ’s chance of being offered certain drugs may be entirely dependent on where they live			1
only last year it emerged as many as a quarter of all @entity35 were refusing to prescribe patients some treatments even though they had been approved for @entity8 use by the @entity39 , or @entity13			1
trusts were found to be trying to save money by holding back life - extending cancer treatments as well as medicines for heart disease , asthma , diabetes and epilepsy			2
health minister @entity48 said patients had a right to drugs and treatments that were approved by @entity13 ministers hope the so - called new ‘ scorecards ’ will encourage trusts to make the drugs available as soon as they are approved by @entity13			1
health minister @entity48 said : ‘ patients have a right to drugs and treatments that have been approved by @entity13			1
this new regime will be a catalyst for change - we are determined to eradicate variation and drive up standards for everyone			0
‘ @entity8 organisations must make sure the latest @entity13 - approved treatments are available in their area , and if they are not , then they will now be responsible for explaining why not			1
being transparent with data like this is the hallmark of a 21st century @entity8			0
it is a fundamental tool to help healthcare professionals improve patient care			0
’ sir @entity75 , chief executive of @entity13 said : ‘ it will be valuable not just to patients but also help hospitals assess how well they ’re performing and ensure that best practice is rapidly disseminated across the @entity8			1
‘ we know that changing professional practice in medicine , like any other profession , can take time			0
doctors , although broadly positively orientated , nevertheless take time to be made aware of the benefits of new treatments and drugs for the patients they are responsible for			2
’ but critics , including senior gps and @entity8 managers , warned the system would create ‘ unnecessary bureacracy ’ – which may even delay treatments being made available			2
dr @entity97 , chair of the @entity98 said : ‘ will it be a bureaucratic tickbox or will it be something more sensible ? and @entity100 , deputy chief executive of the @entity101 warned publishing the lists would create incur extra costs on the health service ’s increasingly strained budget			0
he said : ‘ any new costs have to be offset by savings elsewhere			0
‘ it is important that any new measures do not lead to unnecessary bureaucracy or a duplication of information with no real benefits for hospitals , gps or patients			0
’ currently some @entity35 ( @entity117 ) delay offering new drugs as recommended by the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , while other areas use them on patients straight away			2
under the scheme , which is expected to be rolled out before autumn , hospitals will have ' no excuse not to provide the latest @entity13 - approved drugs and treatments ' , the @entity121 said			1
@entity8 organisations will be automatically added on to publicly available lists of what drugs are available in local areas			1
it is hoped the rules will create a level playing field for treatments such as @entity135 , for which patients living in different regions have had varying levels of opportunity for the treatment			0
last year a report found more than 70 per cent of @entity8 trusts were ignoring @entity13 guidance to offer infertile couples three chances at @entity135 , and some stopped funding treatment completely last year a report found more than 70 per cent of @entity8 trusts were ignoring @entity13 guidance to offer infertile couples three chances at @entity135 , and some stopped funding treatment altogether			1
the study , from a cross-party group of @entity153 , found @entity117 placed strict restrictions on who is eligible for @entity135			0
most pcts put limits on the age at which they will treat women - but one @entity117 was only allowing women to be treated between the ages of 39 and 40			0
this means younger women can wait years for @entity8 treatment despite the fact fertility declines with age			0
some of @entity13 ’s most recent guidance , recommending an extended time to administer a clot - busting drug to treat stroke patients , for example , will soon have to be taken on by all hospitals			2
the @entity121 said the regime will be made up of three different parts :			0

ministers are to force all @entity8 trusts to publish lists of any new treatments they are refusing to give patients
under the plans trusts will also have to explain to the public why these drugs are not yet available
scheme is to be be rolled out in the @entity17
an ' *innovation* scorecard ' will be published , which will allow patients and the public to see which organisations are quickly adopting the latest @entity13 - approved drugs and treatments ;
the @entity8 will have no excuse not to provide the latest @entity13 - approved drugs and treatments . they will be automatically added onto lists of what drugs are available in local areas , which will be published for all to see . this means new drugs and treatments will be automatically made available for doctors to prescribe across the @entity8 ;
making the *uptake* of new drugs and treatments *quicker* by setting up a new group to help local @entity8 organisations *implement* @entity13 *guidelines* . new drugs and treatments can mean the @entity8 has to make *big* changes to the way they provide services , which can be a *complicated* process .
