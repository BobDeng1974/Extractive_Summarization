currently they are only available in @entity6 parents are given the hologram in a special presentation box , but in can be removed and carried in a wallet ' when an expecting mother has a check - up , a 3d/4d echogram is made , and that contains 3d data , ' a spokesman for @entity8 told @entity34 at the optics and photonics exhibition in @entity37 , @entity6			1
' so , we suggest taking pre-birth photos of the baby , by skilfully processing that data , ' the system is unique because it was create the holograms from computer files containing 3d information rather than requite the ' real ' object be photographed			2

@entity8 's prototype 3d hologram printing system , which fits into a briefcase ' this newly developed hologram printer does not require the complex photographical environment previously required for the creation of holograms , which included models to be photographed , vibration dampers and a darkened room , nor does it require any of the high level specialist technology or knowledge in terms of devices , optical system settings or exposure required by the old process , ' the firm said			1
' instead it allows anyone to easily create holograms that is completely original and unique from 3 - dimensional shape data such as computer graphics ( @entity73 )			2
