by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the number of step families has slumped by 14 per cent in a decade , as women delay having children , new figures show			1
the changing face of @entity9 ’s families was revealed by data showing there were 544,000 families with children living with a stepparent in 2011 , down from 631,000 ten years earlier			1
couples who move in together with children from previous relationships are also being priced out parts of the country , because need larger homes with more bedrooms			0
the proportion of stepfamilies is lowest in @entity24 and the @entity25 , where house prices are higher , suggesting larger families are being priced out of some areas between 2001 and 2011 the number of families where children lived with both parents rose by 4 per cent			1
but at the same time the number of stepfamilies fell by 14 per cent , the @entity34 said			1
the dramatic change could be linked to several factors , including the decline in the number of children born to younger parents who are more likely to split up			1
the @entity34 said there were ‘ no clear reasons ’ for the fall in the number of stepfamilies but possible factors include a rise in the average age at which women have their first baby			1
‘ this means that children are less likely to be born to younger couples who are more likely to break up			0
this may lessen the chance of children becoming stepchildren later on , ’ the @entity34 said			0
single parents may also be increasingly likely to have a partner who lives elsewhere and essentially acts as a stepparent to their children without living with them permanently			0
some 85 per cent of stepfamilies include children from the woman ’s previous relationship , 11m - er cent included children from the man ’s previous relationship and 4 per cent from both partners ’ previous relationships , according to the @entity73 in 2011 for @entity9			1
almost one in 10 children lives in a stepfamily , the @entity34 said suprrisngly , the proportion of stepfamilies varied across the country with numbers lowest in @entity24 and the @entity25 where property prices are highest			1
the @entity34 said : ‘ the lowest proportions of couple families with dependent children which were stepfamilies in 2011 were in and to the west of @entity24 , extending along the @entity86			1
‘ meanwhile , the highest proportions were in coastal areas , south @entity89 , @entity90 and the @entity91			0
‘ several reasons may contribute to this pattern including the presence of affordable housing because stepfamilies tend to be larger			0
‘ for example , the cost of homes with enough bedrooms to accommodate children may prevent some people who both have children from moving in together in @entity24 and the @entity25			1
’ among stepfamilies where the parents have married , 28 per cent have three or more dependent children compared with 17 per cent of married couple non-stepfamilies			2
stepfamilies tend to be larger , in part because they can include children from both previous relationships ‘ this may be expected as some couples may have one or more children from a previous relationship and go on to have another child within their current relationship , ’ the @entity34 said			2
‘ alternatively , children may come from both partners ’ previous relationships			0
’ the number of stepfamilies in an area could also be linked to the number of lone parents			2
‘ people from certain ethnic groups may have a lower likelihood of divorcing or having children outside marriage , and so of forming stepfamilies			2
these groups are not evenly spread around the country , ’ the @entity34 added			0
in @entity132 and @entity89 1.1 million of children lived in a stepfamily in 2011 , equivalent to 9 per cent			2
a total of 7.7 million , or 64 per cent , of children lived with both of their parents and 3.1 million or 26 per cent lived with a single parent			0
the majority of children living in stepfamilies lived with parents who have married - 689,000 compared to 418,000 where the parents in the stepfamily have not tied the knot .			0

number of stepfamilies falls from 631,000 in 2001 to 544,000 in 2011
women having children later in life are less likely to split up
proportion of stepfamilies lowest in @entity24 and along @entity157 *corridor*
