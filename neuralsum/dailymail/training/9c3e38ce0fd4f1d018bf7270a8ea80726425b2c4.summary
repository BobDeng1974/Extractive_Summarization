you may have played with transformers as a child , but now there ’s a serious boy ’s toy in the form of a shape - shifting speedboat			2
at the touch of a button , the @entity8 can transform from a standard speedboat into a twin - hull catamaran or even three - hull trimaran			1
the 21ft ( 6.4metre ) vessel , which is backed by @entity15 , uses hydraulic rams to change into six shapes			1
at the touch of a button , the @entity8 can transform from a standard speedboat into a twin - hull catamaran ( illustrated ) or even three - hull trimaran it is made from carbon fibre , titanium , teak and leather and claims to be the first of its kind in the world			1
the vessel is able to ' fly ' above the water using hydrofoils at speeds of almost 45mph ( 72kph ) and three jets mean it can travel 100miles ( 161km ) at full throttle			1
for more leisurely trips , it can be turned into an extravagant bathing platform			0

‘ the design of the @entity8 is driven by function and emotion			0
‘ the idea was to combine the feeling of driving a comfortable super-sports car cabriolet , the preciseness of aircraft technology and special features of other fascinating vehicles			0
’ he explained that the vessel can even transform on the go so that a conventional speedboat shape can be used for quick manoeuvres and a catamaran for stability			1
‘ in addition , the @entity8 can gracefully transform into a large bathing platform , using a minimum of space on transport or storage			0
