hovering high above the mountains these unusual , saucer - like white masses resemble a creature or vehicle from another world - but they are in fact clouds			1
the natural phenomenon , known as a lenticular clouds , tend to form at high altitudes , such as above mountains			1
resembling flying saucers , they form when the air temperature drops and moisture droplets are pushed up a steep slope by high winds the lens - shaped formations are scientifically known as ' altocumulus lenticularis ' and are the result of moist air that has condensed at a high altitude			1
they are formed when the air temperature drops and moisture droplets are pushed up a steep slope by high winds			0
this unique atmospheric condition creates the interesting lens - shaped form that defines a lenticular cloud			0
mountains act as natural barriers forcing clouds to condense quickly as they are pushed to cooler altitudes			2
this is why a large or particularly tall mountain range will experience a moist climate on one side but an arid one on the other			0
@entity11 said that it is possible to walk to the top of a volcano , find the @entity48 by following the mountain rivers and see the first sunrise over all of @entity12 the lenticular cloud pattern depends upon wind speed and the shape of the mountains			1
a constant wind may produce clouds which are stable and remain virtually stationary , as if hovering , in the sky for hours lenticular clouds form when a tall geographic feature , such as the the top of a mountain , interrupts a strong upward - flowing wind			2
the blocked airflow creates a ' wind wave ' pattern in the atmosphere on the downwind side of the mountain			0
just as a rock in a stream will form ripples downstream , a similar effect occurs in the air â€“ with the clouds forming at the peaks of the waves			2
the impressive series of pictures taken by photographer , @entity78 , 33 , show formations over @entity80 , the highest mountain of the @entity15 in @entity12			1
as a keen photographer , @entity11 said he loved nothing more than to capture the natural beauty of his home land of @entity15			1
he said : ' these clouds are very special as they do not move , they stay in one place and it 's only their shape that changes			2
' there needs to be at least two factors for these clouds to appear , a very strong wind and a very high object , so @entity80 is a perfect place to find lenticular clouds			0
' @entity15 is a very special and beautiful land			0
' with every new day i seem to discover more areas of natural beauty that i did n't even know existed			0
' i was born and raised in @entity15 , the so called ' land of fire breathing mountains ' and there is nowhere else like it on @entity102			1

this adds to the disturbing atmosphere evoked by the oddly shaped clouds			0

@entity12 photographer @entity78 , 33 , captured formations the over the @entity15 in @entity12
the rare phenomenon occurs when strong winds are blocked by large geographical features such as mountains
the clouds are often mistaken for flying saucers or cover for @entity143 because of their unusual shape
