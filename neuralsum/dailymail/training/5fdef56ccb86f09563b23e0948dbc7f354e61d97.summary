by @entity1 reporter published : 08:07 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 09:01 est , 19 july 2013 @entity3 is about to see its first openly gay mayor after a singer who owns a gay bar was elected in a rural area of the country			1
the election of @entity10 has been hailed as a significant victory for gay rights in @entity3 , where homosexuals often feel oppressed due to the conservative catholic culture			1
his victory in the city of @entity17 came despite a smear campaign against him in which his political rivals apparently criticised him to voters ' as if being gay were a crime '			2
the city is located in @entity24 in central @entity3 , a largely rural region famous for a macho culture where men wear cowboy hats and boots , and a state plagued by shootouts between drug gangs			2
champion : @entity10 has become @entity3 's first openly gay mayor after being elected in @entity17 mr @entity10 , 47 , described his constituency as ' very machisto ' , adding that the area is ' full of tough country people , who do n't necessarily have much information on what 's happening elsewhere , and have even less of an automatic sympathy with their gay mayor			1
' however , despite his openness about his sexuality , the new mayor insisted : ' it 's not like i 'm going to paint city hall pink			0
' gay people in @entity3 rarely face official persecution , as homosexuality has been legal in the country since the 19th century , and there are a number of laws banning anti-gay discrimination			1
however , 95 per cent of @entity3 gays feel oppressed by others , according to a recent survey , as the strong @entity61 influence on society means many people regard homosexuality as immoral			1
while a number of @entity3 politicians have been rumoured to be gay , none has ever come out , making mr @entity10 the most senior openly gay official ever to have been elected			1
he won his victory by campaigning over public safety , aiming to clamp down on the gang turf war in @entity17 which has led to bodies being found hacked to bits , decapitated or with their throats slashed			0
tough : the area where mr @entity10 will hold office is remote and plagued with violence the city of 230,000 is at the centre of fierce fighting between the @entity82 and the @entity83 because it sits on some of northern @entity3 's main trafficking routes			1
mr @entity10 insisted he is ' not at risk ' because he has no ties to any of the cartels , but admitted : ' of course , i have the same fear that anybody who lives in @entity17 has			2
' he said that he had become accepted in the rough region thanks to his fame as a singer - one area where homosexuality is widely accepted - and his two decades running a gay bar			2
the new mayor has been seen at gay rights marches in the past , and said he is ' very proud to be the first openly gay mayor in this country ' - adding that other gay politicans should be unafraid to be open about their sexuality			1
mr @entity10 is a @entity61 , and is reluctant to contradict the teaching of the church			0
' i wish the church had a different view , but i can not go against doctrine , ' he said			0
' i respect my church , and i do n't want to dig any deeper beyond what 's permitted and what is appropriate			0
' ' i 'm not in favour of gay marriage , i do n't share that view , because we are still a very small town - in short , we 're not prepared , in my view			0
not yet , anyway , because we have strong roots in our religion , and in our customs			0
' gay rights campaigner @entity120 , director of @entity121 , said that mr @entity10 's election was likely to be a breakthrough for the movement in @entity3 , adding that the only gay politicians to hold office previously were chosen by political parties rather than directly by voters			1
' this shows that our human rights system is providing some protection , ' he said			0
' because , even though there is no public majority in favor of electing gay politicians , he knows that the legal framework will protect him			0
' it is now more risky for a political rival to be openly homophobic than it is to be a homosexual candidate			0

@entity10 , 47 , will take office as mayor of violence - plagued @entity17
says he is proud to be a pioneer for gay rights but will not push gay agenda
homosexuality is legal in @entity3 but many gay people face discrimination
