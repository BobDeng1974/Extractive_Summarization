ever wondered what happens once you 've popped a pill ? well now you can watch this journey for yourself on video footage , captured by a pioneering camera			2
the futuristic ‘ @entity10 ’ is a tiny camera fitted with a flashing led light , designed to show up any abnormalities inside the human body			1
the patient wears a belt , which receives and stores the images , to help identify conditions such as coeliac disease and @entity21 in the small bowel the camera is swallowed in the same way as traditional tablets , and takes the same route as food			1
it travels through the body , capturing 18 photos ever second			1
once the patient has swallowed the @entity10 , it travels all the way through the body in a matter of hours			1
each @entity10 is used only once before being thrown away			1
it measures 0.4 inches ( 11mm ) by one inch ( 26mm ) , and weighs four grams			0
the patient wears a belt , which receives and stores the images to help identify conditions such as coeliac disease and @entity21			2
the capsule endoscopy costs around £ 500 a time			0
it is available at a handful of hospitals in the @entity44 including @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			0
it means doctors and nurses can see more of the internal organs , picking up problems that external scans may not find			1
dr @entity54 , a consultant gastroenterologist who introduced capsule endoscopy to the @entity56 , said : ‘ there is a huge amount we are not able to see with a usual endoscopy			2
‘ most people find it fascinating			2
this really was science fiction 20 years ago but now it 's a reality			0
’ while body parts such as the oesophagus , stomach and large bowel can be successfully scanned using traditional equipment , other organs such as the intestines and small bowel are not accessible with an endoscope - a thin , flexible tube with a camera on the end			1
also , the small bowel , which measures between six and 26ft ( two and eight metres ) long , lies in the middle of the digestive system - making it difficult for medical staff to examine			0

the futuristic ‘ @entity10 ’ is a tiny camera fitted with a flashing led light
it is designed to show up any abnormalities inside the human body
the camera is swallowed like traditional tablets and takes the same route through the body as food
as it moves through the body , it takes 18 images every second
this means medics can see inside organs without the need for *surgery*
it will also pick up problems that external scans traditionally would *n't* find
