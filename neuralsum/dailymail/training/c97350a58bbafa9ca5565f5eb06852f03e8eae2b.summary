by @entity0 published : 15:04 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 15:14 est , 4 april 2013 the @entity1 is asking @entity3 ’s aging veterans to put their faith in the organization and pay $ 350 for treatment to help cure illnesses possibly caused by exposure to @entity9			1
a mushroom farm in northern @entity3 has been converted into the @entity12 center – to help the veterans still suffering from the effects of war			1
@entity17 veteran @entity16 is one of its followers , and is seen grimacing as he forces down the last of the 35 vitamins he takes each morning			2
" i have to take them , " the 62 - year - old said at a treatment center established with the help of a @entity12 - funded group			1
" they will clean up my body			2
" the center owes as much to @entity12 's desire to expand around the world , away from scandal in the @entity49 , as it does to pressure in @entity3 to try to help aging veterans still suffering from the effects of war			1
many medical experts regard the treatment — a 25 - day vitamin and sauna regime — as junk medicine or even dangerous			1
but for now at least , it has found fertile ground here			2
the @entity3 advocacy group overseeing the program in @entity33 province wants to offer it to all 20,000 people suffering from ailments blamed on dioxins in @entity9			1
@entity49 airplanes sprayed up to 12 million gallons of the defoliant over the country during the @entity27 to strip away vegetation used as cover by @entity3 soldiers			1
going in for treatment : a patient enters a sauna room at the @entity32 of the @entity76 of @entity77 in @entity33 , @entity3 the advocacy group , which has the implicit support of the government , has almost completed a two - story accommodation block for patients and is raising funds for a much larger complex , with 15 more saunas than the five it currently has			1
" i have seen so many desperate families that their tears have dried up , " said @entity87 , the head of local branch of the @entity76 of @entity90 in @entity33			2
" i do n't know what the scientists say about its effectiveness , but the patients say it improves their health			2
they should be able to experience it before they die			0
" @entity102 believe the regime , which includes massive consumption of vitamins , four - hour sauna sessions and morning runs , can " sweat out " toxins stored in body fat			0
there are no peer - reviewed studies to back this claim			0
the center was established in 2010 by five foreign members of a scientology - funded sister organization , @entity116			0
they gave local staff two months of training			0
the group is devoted to spreading church founder @entity122 's social welfare programs and health treatments around the world			0
suffering : @entity125 , 63 , shows off his scar after he was wounded in a battle in 1975 , during the @entity27 the center makes no reference to its links to the church , and the volunteers have long departed			1
but having its " @entity137 " treatment accepted by authorities here adds legitimacy to it , and gives the church a foothold from which to grow			1
the church sent volunteers to @entity145 to administer another of its treatments , a massage called a " touch assist , " in the aftermath of disasters including the 2004 @entity151 tsunami and 2008 @entity153 cyclone			0
since its emergence in the 1950s , @entity12 has battled accusations , legal challenges and government scrutiny around the world over accusations it is a secretive cult that preys on vulnerable people			2
its leaders deny those accusations			0
@entity102 market the " rundown " treatment simultaneously as a spiritual treatment for followers and as a secular one for those needing " detox , " either from drug addiction or chemical exposure			2
two affiliated @entity12 groups use the treatment in drug rehabilitation centers that have drawn wrongful death lawsuits and investigations			2
in 1991 , @entity12 offered " rundown " treatments in @entity179 to people suffering symptoms related to radiation exposure following the chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986			1
the church still refers to the mission in its online literature , claiming numerous successes , but @entity179 banned it from performing medical treatment in the country in 1996			1
last year , a @entity191 court upheld fraud charges and fined the church $ 791,000 for its efforts to persuade people to take the " rundown			2
" @entity198 dose : patients at the @entity32 take a dose of 35 vitamins in the early morning in @entity33 , @entity3 - the center runs a 25 - day health program @entity204 , vice president of @entity205 , said the detox has helped thousands of people exposed to chemical contamination , alleviating symptoms such as sleep difficulties , memory problems , pain and mood swings			1
" whatever the long - term health status of these individuals may be , reducing symptoms that have persisted for decades can have profoundly beneficial effects and this is a worthwhile goal in itself , " @entity204 said via email			0
the @entity33 province group said it selects patients based on the severity of their symptoms , and that about 600 people have gone through the course			2
fourteen days into the program , @entity16 , who suffers from diabetes , nervous system complaints and memory loss , said he was sleeping better , has a better appetite and felt better overall			0
a reporter questioned four other patients , all of whom made similar statements			0
all patients get daily care and attention from nurses , as well as pulse and blood pressure checks by doctors			0
those who live outside of town also receive food and board during the course			0
" it is an excellent program			0
i feel my health is much improved , " said @entity16 , who spent much of the war fighting along the @entity250 , which was heavily sprayed with @entity9			1
it is unclear if those feelings of better health endure			0
@entity87 said it was too expensive to monitor patients once they leave the center			0
many people exposed to @entity9 in @entity3 ca n't work , or have family members that need full - time care			1
check ups : patients at the @entity32 of the @entity264 get their pulse and blood pressure checked by doctors the @entity3 government provides them a stipend of between $ 50 and $ 90 a month , but there are few residential centers for people with severe disabilities			1
none of those taking the course when an @entity0 reporting team visited recently appeared to be suffering from life - threatening or debilitating illnesses			2
all were able to comfortably jog slowly for half an hour			0
@entity279 , a 29 - year - old patient , said he was on the course after his father offered his place to him			0
he said he needed it because he and his wife had been having trouble conceiving			0
in the @entity49 , the @entity285 on the @entity286 , part of the @entity288 , said in 2010 that there is an association between herbicide exposure and some forms of cancer , including @entity294 's and @entity296 's lymphoma			1
it said there was more limited evidence of possible associations with several other diseases			0
@entity302 has for years questioned whether @entity9 is responsible for sickening @entity49 or @entity3 , though it has spent billions on health care and other programs for @entity49 veterans who were exposed			1
it denies any legal liability in @entity3			1
while it gives money to @entity3 health and disability programs in general , it ignores @entity3 requests for compensation or direct assistance to victims , saying all help is " regardless of cause			1
" @entity3 attributes more illness and conditions to exposure then @entity49 does , including , for example , reproductive abnormalities and congenital deformities			1
very few people in @entity3 have been tested for levels of dioxins			1
@entity87 says the treatment costs around $ 350 per person , which the victims association pays for			2
it gets some funds from individual donors , both at home and abroad , and @entity3 companies , often state - run ones			1
the center 's expansion is being financed by a joint venture company owned by state - owned @entity340 and a @entity179 company			0
last year , the military began a second " rundown " course at a military hospital in the capital , @entity346 , according to the head of the national victims support group , @entity351			0
worth the cost ? many medical experts regard the treatment , a 25 - day vitamin and sauna regime , as junk medicine or even dangerous blood samples taken from patients before and after the treatment are being sent to @entity362 , where a lab has been contracted to check whether dioxin levels have changed , he said			1
the hospital declined to answer questions about the program			0
many medical experts are troubled by the large amount of vitamins " rundown " patients are instructed to take , especially niacin , which far exceed the daily recommended doses by the @entity375			1
the @entity375 warns that taking too much niacin can lead to " liver problems , gout , ulcers of the digestive tract , loss of vision , high blood sugar , irregular heartbeat , and other serious problems			0
" " it 's bad enough that the treatment is ineffective ... and that people 's expectations get raised			1
another thing that it is a potentially dangerous undertaking , " said @entity390 , a sociology professor at the @entity391 in @entity392 who has studied @entity12			2
still , patients including @entity395 are hopeful			0
she worked along the @entity250 , repairing bridges and roads damaged by @entity49 bombs			1
since the war ended , she has suffered two miscarriages , has a daughter diagnosed with @entity403 and suffers from uterine fibroids , cysts and other ailments			2
" the veterans here may look not very ill , but many of us are rotten from inside with illnesses , " she said , her face red after emerging from a sauna session			0
" after 13 days , i have n't seen a drastic improvement but i think i will be better with time			0
other people who have finished the treatment highly recommended it			1
they looked very healthy when i saw them			0

many medical experts regard the treatment as junk medicine or dangerous
