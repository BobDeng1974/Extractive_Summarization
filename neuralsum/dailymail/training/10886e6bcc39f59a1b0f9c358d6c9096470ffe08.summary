the @entity2 's @entity1 unit has blasted its flagship today programme over its failure to provide balance on a debate on climate change			1
the show 's editorial team was found to have given minority views and opinions ' equal footing ' to those of the scientific consensus			1
the programme , broadcast in february during the major flooding crisis featured climate change scientist sir @entity17 from @entity19 who was debating the issue with a founder of the @entity23 , which is sceptical as to its impact			1
the interview by @entity27 , pictured , was criticised for giving an ' equal footing ' to minority views on climate change during the today programme broadcast in february during the major flood crisis the main complaint for made by former @entity35 councillor and low - energy specialist @entity36 who said the @entity2 acted irresponsibly in allowing the debate to consider the existence of climate change			1
speaking today mr @entity36 said : ' dismissing climate change today is the same as trying to argue that smoking is not harmful			2
the science has proved the existence of climate change			2
' by broadcasting programmes that question the existence of climate change , the @entity2 is confusing people , allowing them to deny what is actually happening			1
it is not responsible journalism			0
' politicians look at the public mood when considering policy and if sections of the population are sceptical to climate change , the government 's policy decisions will reflect that			2
' a @entity2 spokesperson said : ' the @entity2 is committed to impartial and balanced coverage of climate change			1
we accept that there is broad scientific agreement on the issue and reflect this accordingly			0
' across our programmes the number of scientists and academics who support the mainstream view far outweighs those who disagree with it			0
' @entity75 , the then editor of the today programme admitted they should have ' clarified in the audience 's minds the ideological background to the arguments ' former chancellor of the exchequer @entity82 appeared on the show as a founder of the @entity23			2
during the show , @entity82 claimed that 2013 was ' unusually quiet ' for tropical storms and that ' nobody knows ' about the true extent of climate change			0
lord @entity82 said that investing in green energy was a waste of money and those resources should be focused on improving defences against bad weather			0
several listeners complained to the @entity2 's @entity1 unit who , according to @entity99 , will criticise the show 's approach in a report due to be released later today			1
according to @entity104 , head of the unit : ' minority opinions and sceptical views should not be treated as if it were on an equal footing with the scientific consensus			1
' @entity82 's views are not supported by the evidence from computer modelling and scientific research and i do n't believe this was made sufficiently clear to the audience			0
' i do not believe it was made sufficiently clear that @entity82 's views on climate change are not supported by the majority of climate scientists , and should not be regarded as carrying equal weight to those of experts such as sir @entity127			1
' today 's then editor @entity75 said : ' whilst there may be a scientific consensus about global warming - that it is happening and largely man - made - there is no similar agreement about what should be done to tackle it ; whether money should be spent , for example , on cutting carbon emissions or would be better used adapting our defences to the changing climate			0
' @entity82 is not a scientist , but as a former chancellor of the exchequer is well qualified to comment on the economic arguments , which are a legitimate area for debate			0
' we believe there has to be space in the @entity2 's coverage where scientific consensus meets reasonable argument about the policy implications of that consensus view			2
that said we do accept that we could have offered a clearer description of the sceptical position taken by @entity82 and the @entity23 in the introduction			0
that would have clarified in the audience 's minds the ideological background to the arguments			0
