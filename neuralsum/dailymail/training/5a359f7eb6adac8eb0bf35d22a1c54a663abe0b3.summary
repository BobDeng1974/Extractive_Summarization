eco-friendly led lights may damage your eyes , according to new research			1
a study has discovered that exposure to led lights can cause irreparable harm to the retina of the human eye			1
led lights have been touted as a super-efficient alternative to traditional bulbs because they use up to 85 per cent less energy and each bulb can last up to 10 years			2
in april , @entity13 , the world 's biggest lighting maker , reported a 38 per cent jump in led light sales from last year			1
a @entity19 study has shown that the light emitted by @entity22 bulbs can damage the cells in the retina			1
some experts are now calling for a filter to be fitted in the bulbs ( file picture ) they are already widely used in mobile phones , televisions , computer screens and can also be fitted as a replacement for traditional lighting in the home			0
leds are much more expensive that traditional bulbs - costing around £ 25 for an equivalent 100w compared to around £ 1 for an incandescent bulb - although manufacturers claim that consumers make their money back because the use such little energy			2
the government announced it was phasing out incandescent bulbs in 2007 after an @entity45 directive banned their use			0
the 100w bulb was the first to go in 2009 and lower wattage bulbs continue to be phased out gradually			0
the ban caused public outrage as customers were forced to spend large sums of money on lighting that not only gave an unpleasantly ' cold ' light but also caused some people to report symptoms of itchy skin and headaches			0
the government 's @entity60 , which was brought in to help cut @entity63 carbon emissions , is also pushing the use of @entity22 lighting by offering businesses added tax relief if they use led and other low - energy bulbs			1
dr. @entity69 , of @entity70 in @entity71 and who led the study , explained that light from leds , or light - emitting diodes , comes from the short - wave , high - energy blue and violet end of the visible light spectrum			1
incandescent bulbs ( left ) are being phased out in favour of low - energy alternatives such as @entity82 ( right ) , but there are concerns about the safety of the new generation of so - called ' environmentally friendly ' lighting she said that prolonged , continuous exposure to this light may be enough to damage a person 's retina			1
the retina is composed of light - sensitive tissue that is responsible for detecting light and in turn allowing us to see			2
‘ this problem is going to get worse , because humans are living longer and children are using electronic devices from a young age , particularly for schoolwork , ’ @entity69 told @entity97			0
enterprising : lighting shop owner @entity104 , from @entity105 , stockpiled 3000 incandescent bulbs after 75 watt bulbs were phased out in 2011 ‘ eyes are not designed to look directly at light — they are designed to see with light , ’ @entity69 said			2
her comments are partly based on her 2012 study that was published in the journal @entity114			0
the study found that @entity22 radiation caused significant damage to human retinal pigment epithelial cells in vitro			0
@entity69 added that modern humans have their eyes open for roughly 6,000 hours a year , and are exposed to artificial light for the majority of that time			0
some experts have called for the led lights to have built - in filters to cut out the blue glare			2
this is not the first time energy - saving lights have come under scrutiny for safety reasons			1
compact fluorescent light bulbs , or @entity82 , have been criticized for the high levels of mercury they contain as well as the uv radiation they can emit			1
led lights have also been blamed for the changing hues of masterpieces in art galleries			0
a study carried out by the @entity143 earlier this year found that led lights were bleaching the paint on works by @entity146 and @entity147 .			0

@entity19 research has shown that blue led light can irreparably damage the cells in the eye 's retina
this is not the first time energy - saving bulbs have been criticised - fluorescent bulbs emit *dangerous* uv light
