the 24 - year - old has been in and out of the @entity9 side since his big - money move from @entity11 in the summer			0
@entity1 has shown flashes of the promise which won him a place in the @entity2 squad at the @entity16 in @entity17 , but has otherwise looked off the pace of the @entity20 top flight			2

@entity9 boss @entity0 , november 's manager of the month , says @entity1 may sit out against @entity6 ‘ the way he plays , sometimes he can get lost a little bit			1

’ the @entity9 manager says coming off the bench suits the @entity46 's game as he adapts to the league @entity1 has shown flashes of his brilliant best , but has not been able to perform consistently yet			1
