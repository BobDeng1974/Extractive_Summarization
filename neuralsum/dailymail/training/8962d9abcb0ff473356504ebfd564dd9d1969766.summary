for the first time since the annual population survey began in 2004 , there were more @entity23 citizens living in the @entity8 – 2.5million – than held @entity35 nationality ( 2.3million )			1
the statistics were published as @entity37 was rocked by @entity39 mp @entity38 defecting to @entity40 , which has demanded tougher controls on @entity8 ’s borders			2
the figures offer clear evidence of how a new wave of @entity23 immigration has taken advantage of @entity8 ’s fast - recovering economy – which has produced an extra two million private sector jobs since 2010 – while the @entity51 remains mired in chaos			1
experts told mr @entity2 that imposing limits was , in a reference to folklore , akin to ‘ @entity57 trying to hold back the waves ’			0
according to the quarterly statistics , a total of 560,000 immigrants arrived in the @entity8 in the 12 months to march , while an estimated 317,000 people left			2

@entity79 leader @entity79 , the deputy prime minister , said the @entity84 had ‘ gone quiet ’ on the target and regarded it as a ‘ mistake ’ , while @entity80 said the government ’s migration target was in ‘ tatters ’			0
‘ this massive gap between rhetoric and the reality , as well as no serious action to tackle the root causes of anxiety about immigration , is destroying public trust and confidence , ’ said shadow home secretary @entity88			0
@entity40 mep @entity98 said ministers were not ‘ listening to the people ’ and that the levels of immigration were ‘ driving down wages and causing overcrowding in schools ’			0
sir @entity105 , chairman of the @entity107 think - tank , said : ‘ either we get immigration under control or we accept that in the next 20 years we will have to build 12 cities the size of @entity112			0
where can they possibly be put ? ’ @entity115 , chief economist for accountants @entity116 , said the figures suggested that ‘ relatively strong growth ’ in the @entity8 was drawing in workers from elsewhere in the @entity23			1
the number of people leaving the @entity8 has consistently been lower than the number of immigrants arriving each year since the 1990s @entity79 leader @entity79 ( pictured ) , the deputy prime minister , said the @entity84 had ‘ gone quiet ’ on the target and regarded it as a ‘ mistake ’ , while @entity80 said the government ’s migration target was in ‘ tatters ’ ‘ in the face of these economic forces , attempts to limit net migration to the “ tens of thousands ” appear like @entity57 trying to hold back the waves , ’ he said			1

’ @entity145 , research director of the @entity147 think - tank , said the latest figures would be a headache for mr @entity2			0
‘ these figures will provide more ammunition for those who want the prime minister to go further in limiting the rights of @entity23 migrants not only to claim welfare benefits but settle in the @entity8 , ’ he said			1
immigration minister @entity156 said reforms had cut net migration by a quarter since @entity80 were in power and the government remained focused on controlling migration at ‘ sustainable ’ levels			2
