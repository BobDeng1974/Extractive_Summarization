by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 has repeated his call for @entity4 to relinquish his place in @entity7 's one - day side , likening the team 's current methods to a ' two - litre diesel in a @entity12 race '			1
@entity2 , who retired from cricket during @entity7 's miserable winter tour to @entity15 , earlier this week urged captain cook to give up his limited - overs place and allow the likes of @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 the chance to show what they can do in a more exciting and attacking line - up			1
@entity2 believes @entity7 's current ' outdated ' odi approach and tactics means they have no chance of winning next year 's @entity30			1
@entity4 ( left ) and @entity2 ( right ) were teammates until @entity2 's retirement in december 2013 @entity4 , opening the batting for @entity7 against @entity34 on wednesday , has been urged by @entity2 to stand down as one day captain @entity4 responded to his former team - mate 's comments after @entity7 's crushing 133 - run @entity39 defeat to @entity34 on wednesday by saying : ' i do n't think it 's that helpful - especially from a so - called friend ' - but @entity2 is refusing to back down			1
he wrote in his column in @entity44 on friday : ' real mates are honest with each other			0
i 'm no longer in the @entity7 dressing room and it is my job now as a pundit to give my honest thoughts			2
' i think being one - day captain is a poisoned chalice for him			1
he just does n't need the job			0
the cricket @entity7 are playing in 50 - over cricket is outdated and i fear it will be a painful winter for the team			2
' i do n't want him to be part of it			0
this is not a witch - hunt against ' cookie ' and i 'm still a huge supporter of his captaincy in test cricket			0
but , in one - day matches , i want @entity7 to play the exciting cricket they promised six months ago when @entity69 took over as head coach			1
@entity2 ( right ) has taken up a role in the media since his retirement from cricket			0
' we 're happy to tootle along in a two - litre diesel in a @entity12 race			0
' @entity7 must change their strategy to have any chance of winning the @entity30			2
' i 'm 100 per cent behind him as @entity83 captain			0
but , in one - day cricket , you should pick your 11 best players and choose your captain from there and i do n't think he is one of the best 11 players			1
