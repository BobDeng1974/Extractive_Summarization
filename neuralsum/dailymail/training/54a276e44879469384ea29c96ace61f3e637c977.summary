by @entity0 last updated at 7:58 am on 5th december 2011 transport secretary @entity1 is considering whether a £ 500 million tunnel should be bored to minimise impact on the landscape ministers are considering drilling a tunnel costing up to £ 500million under the @entity7 as senior @entity9 rebel against the new high speed rail link			2
transport secretary @entity1 will confirm this week that she is delaying the decision over the @entity13 route between @entity14 and @entity15 until the @entity16			1
the 1.5 - mile tunnel would be in the constituency of welsh secretary @entity19			2
she is deeply opposed to the rail link and has indicated she may quit the @entity21 if the route ploughs through her @entity24 and @entity25 constituency			2
other senior @entity9 opposed to the proposed route include @entity28 minister @entity27 and @entity30 whip @entity29			0
speaker @entity31 is also reported to oppose it			0
the 100 - mile rail link , which would be built between 2016 and 2026 , aims to cut the @entity14 to @entity15 journey time to 49 minutes from the current typical time of 1 hr 23 min. not on their backyard : an @entity39 sign in picturesque @entity40 in @entity41 @entity19 mp : opposed to the line ministers argue that the improvement will boost the economy of the @entity47 , the @entity48 and @entity49			1
the cost of the extra tunnel has been reported to be around £ 500million , although sources say it will be ‘ significantly ’ less and would be funded by savings made elsewhere on the route			0
it would join up two other tunnels around @entity25 , reducing the impact on the @entity7 , a designated area of outstanding natural beauty			0
the campaign to @entity62 said additional tunnelling would be ‘ essential ’ if @entity13 is to be built through the @entity7			1
but a spokesman added : ‘ we are concerned by suggestions that the additional £ 500million will come from cutting back on mitigation measures elsewhere			0
under threat : a @entity70 mansion in @entity71 where the proposed @entity13 high speed rail line route will cut through the @entity7 ' just because countryside is not nationally designated does not mean it should not be valued and protected			1
@entity74 has put forward an alternative route which would see @entity13 using more existing transport ‘ corridors ’			1
transport spokesman @entity78 said : ‘ @entity79 stubbornly refusing to consider @entity74 ’s alternative plan for @entity13 , half a billion pounds of taxpayers ’ money is set to be spent on mitigating the environmental impacts of a flawed route			1
’ meanwhile , a report commissioned by 17 councils affected by the route has accused ministers of making a ‘ deeply flawed and very weak ’ economic case for the project			0
it says benefits to the taxpayer could be as little as half the £ 32billion costs			0
hard line : protesters advocate for the line to be scrapped with several posters on roads in @entity41			2
