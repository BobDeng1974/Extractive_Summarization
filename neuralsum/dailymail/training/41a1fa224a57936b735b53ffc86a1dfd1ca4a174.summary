by @entity0 , @entity1 editor plans to clamp down on the promotion of junk food in supermarkets have been scrapped after major stores refused to sign up			0
under the scheme , so - called ‘ guilt lanes ’ – where sweets and chocolates are prominently displayed next to checkouts – would have been banned			1
but the retailers have effectively killed off the government ’s ‘ @entity13 ’ to tackle rising obesity levels by refusing to sign up			1
retailers have refused to sign up to the government 's ' @entity17 ' to remove prominently displayed sweets and chocolate from checkouts , to help tackle obesity levels health campaigners last night accused the supermarkets of putting profit before their customers ’ health , and said ministers should introduce laws on junk food rather than relying on voluntary schemes			1
as well as action on guilt lanes , under the plan there would have been a ban on promoting sugary drinks and snacks in high - profile positions on the end of shelves after a government - backed study found this led to a surge in sales			1
the supermarkets have also rejected the idea of setting up a scheme that would have given customers rewards for buying healthy food such as fruit and vegetables			2
the collapse of the initiatives is a huge blow to the government ’s efforts to tackle rising obesity and associated ill - health , which is costing the @entity59 £ 5billion a year to treat			1
the government ’s chief medical officer , dame @entity60 , is so concerned about unhealthy food that she has suggested it may be necessary to impose sugar tax to curb consumption			0
and it will raise further questions over the influence that supermarkets and other food giants are able to exert on government policy			0
the @entity71 revealed in february how the food industry lobby had been given unprecedented access to the heart of @entity61			1
supermarkets , fast food chains and chocolate and fizzy drinks firms have had dozens of meetings with ministers since the 2010 election , while health campaigners had been kept at arms length			0
@entity84 , spokesman for the @entity85 and chairman of the @entity87 , said the collapse of the scheme was evidence that voluntary deals with the retail industry would not work			2
he said : ‘ @entity93 at the checkouts , where children demand sweets and chocolates , is enormously powerful			1
‘ the fact that the supermarkets refuse to tackle this is a disaster			2
‘ the government has been told by many people that voluntary deals do not work and here is the proof			0
the collapse of the initiatives is a huge blow to the government 's efforts to tackle rising obesity levels and associated ill - health which is costing the @entity59 £ 2.5billion a year to treat ' the reality is that money comes first and health second			1
’ she added : ‘ it is time for the government to take a firm line			0
obesity is a totally preventable problem			2
‘ if the supermarkets lose a little money for public good that is something they should be able to shoulder			0
’ it was hoped the public health responsibility deal would have seen all the major supermarkets promise to voluntarily ban junk food – high in fat , salt and sugar – from ‘ guilt lanes ’ and prominent positions at the end of aisles			1
retailers would also have agreed that more than 30 per cent of food promotions , such as buy - one - get - one - free , would be skewed towards healthy products such as fruit and vegetables			2
there would also have been a ban on the use of popular children ’s characters , such as movie superheroes or pop stars , to promote unhealthy food and fizzy drinks			0
however , trade magazine @entity152 said the supermarkets had refused to sign up to the wide - ranging measures as they ‘ had failed to reach a consensus and claimed a voluntary pledge would not work on such a commercially sensitive issue ’			0
the @entity158 has conceded that it will have to leave it up to individual retailers as to whether they want to stop promoting junk food .			0

under scheme ' guilt lanes ' would have been banned
retailers have killed @entity61 's ' @entity13 '
aimed to tackle rising obesity levels by banning sweets from checkouts
