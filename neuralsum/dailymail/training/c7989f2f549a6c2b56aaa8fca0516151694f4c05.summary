@entity0 says he still hopes to be involved in @entity2 ’s clash with @entity3 on sunday after playing just over an hour for the @entity4 ’ under 21s against @entity6			1
@entity0 barely broke into a sweat as he sat in front of a back four , reading the game with trademark intelligence as he coasted through their 2 - 1 win			1
he returned to the bench for @entity2 ’s 2 - 2 draw at @entity16 on monday but manager @entity17 seemed to have ruled him out of sunday ’s game , claiming the midfielder needs more minutes under his belt as he returns from an ankle injury			1
@entity2 star @entity0 got 64 minutes under his belt against his former side @entity0 warmed up with his @entity2 team - mates before taking part in the @entity27 21 match @entity0 was joined by fellow senior star @entity28 in @entity2 's starting line - up to play @entity6 @entity4 star @entity0 was an unused substitute against @entity16 on monday night @entity31 : @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42			1

subs : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63			0
but @entity0 insists his appearance at @entity6 ’s academy ground on friday night does not mean he is ruled out of contention on sunday and the @entity68 midfielder says he still hopes to play a part against the league leaders at @entity71			1
@entity0 , speaking exclusively to @entity72 , said : ' i 'm realistic , i 've got to be patient			2
i 've been out for five and a half months so i 've got to understand the bigger picture			0
i 'm not saying i wo n't be involved on sunday , hopefully i can be in some way			0
' i do n't know yet though , i 'll just have to wait and see			0
i 'm just being patient really , i 've got to understand the situation			0
' it 's been a long time			0
i 've been injured for three months but i 've been out for five and a half months since my last game so to get back was a big step really			0
' the 33 - year - old has not played a competitive game since @entity2 ’s 1 - 1 draw at @entity84 on the final day of last season and underwent ankle surgery in july – on the day @entity87 was unveiled by the club			1
he has since spent three months on the sidelines as @entity2 have struggled to put last season ’s travails behind them , picking up just three wins from their opening eight league games along with an embarrassing exit from the @entity96 after a 4 - 0 drubbing at the hands of @entity99			2
@entity87 has toyed with different systems but struggled to find a player to protect his defence , despite the best efforts of new signing @entity104 , and is keen to get @entity0 back into the fold			2
@entity0 whispers to @entity2 team - mate @entity56 during a set piece routine @entity0 played 64 minutes against a @entity6 academy team – where he started his professional career – and sat in front of a back four , rarely pushing himself into an attacking area as he looked to dictate the play and provide @entity2 ’s young attackers with some forward thrust			1
@entity2 won the game after @entity56 ’s fine opener had been levelled by @entity6 ’s @entity40 , before @entity117 grabbed a 78th - minute winner , 14 minutes after @entity0 had been replaced			1
his inclusion in the match , under 48 hours before the sunday ’s game , as well as @entity87 ’s pre-match comments , seem to suggest the midfielder is unlikely to play , despite his desire to get back to @entity126 business			2
@entity87 had said : ' i 'm sorry to say no other players are back , even if i let @entity0 play in @entity129 for reserves because he needs to play matches when you are five months injured			2
he told me it was his first game for the reserves			0
' but @entity0 was still pleased to get some game time at the @entity6 ’ @entity137 academy ground , 10 years after leaving the club for @entity139 in a £ 3.5million deal			1
' they started using [ @entity142 ] just as i was leaving , ' he added			0
' the last time i was here was to watch my brother [ @entity146 ] play			0
he was at @entity6 just as i had left really			2
but it 's nice to be back and see a few old faces			0
