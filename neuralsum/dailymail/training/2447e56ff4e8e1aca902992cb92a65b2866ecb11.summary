the woman at the forefront of the design of @entity4 's 24 carat gold shorts - the most expensive in sporting history - has detailed the process behind them ahead of the 28 - year - old 's world title bout against @entity10 on saturday night			1
earlier this week it was revealed that @entity4 would be wearing the unique piece of clothing , worth around £ 30,000 , when fighting against @entity10 at the @entity14 in @entity15			1
@entity16 , designer of the shorts and creator of @entity19 , spoke in detail about the thinking behind the development of the shorts			2
' they have a thousand exclusive members who can order any kind of clothing they wish , which can then be customised with 24 carat gold			1
' @entity4 is one of their members so we then got talking and it was agreed we could use the 24 carat gold to make the waistband for his shorts			1
' the outside of the shorts are covered in lamb nappa leather with crocodile trim , and then the lining is 100 per cent silk , so you have to combine all those materials through different machines - so it was a jigsaw to put them all together			2
' but i want every fighter to be unique and have unusual fabrics - so it was worth it			0
@entity16 , designer and creator of @entity19 , spoke passionately about the process behind the shorts @entity16 and @entity4 pose for a photo together at an event ahead of the latter 's world title fight on saturday the banner for @entity4 and @entity10 's fight hanging on the side of the @entity79 in @entity15 ' we started about four months ago on the training kit and then we were brainstorming ideas before putting pen to paper			1
' it 's probably been a four to six week period process to piece it all together and finalising all the designs for the fight night shorts			0
' it 's been a really exciting process working with @entity4			2
at @entity19 i want to create people 's dream shorts and make them a reality to wear			0
when you look good you feel good , and then you fight better too			0
' whether or not we had the material from 24kt we still strive to make unusual , unique fabrics and there 's so many more different styles and trends to explore - that 's why i 'm in this business			0
' @entity4 beat @entity29 @entity104 in his last fight , which was also in @entity15 , back in may this year the @entity106 does n't seem to have indulged in any birthday cake on tuesday , when he turned 28 @entity4 talks to journalists , including @entity34 's @entity109 , ahead of his upcoming fight despite her latest accomplishments @entity16 is not standing still , and is already thinking of fresh plans for the future when she returns to the @entity114 after this weekend 's fight , admitting she 'd relish the opportunity to work with @entity117			1
she added : ' because of the rate we 're rapidly expanding the immediate plan is to hire more staff when we get back			0
' i 'd love to do a pair for @entity117 ( @entity117 ) , as i think we could go really flamboyant , after judging by what he 's worn at his previous fights at the @entity127			2
' so one day it 'd be nice for @entity19 to be up there in and amongst the @entity117 fame			0
