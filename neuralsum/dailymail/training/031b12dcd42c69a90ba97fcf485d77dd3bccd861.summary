by @entity1 medical correspondent published : 20:23 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 08:40 est , 5 november 2013 coping with a cold ? doctors believe paracetamol is the best treatment to keep on top of coughs , colds and sore throats			1
new research suggests paracetamol - contained in many over the counter remedies - is superior to ibuprofen , or a combination of paracetamol and ibuprofen			1
the widely used practice of inhaling steam to ease symptoms also offers little comfort to sufferers , according to researchers from the @entity24			1
bless you : new research suggests paracetamol is superior to ibuprofen , or a combination of paracetamol and ibuprofen when it comes to keeping on top of colds in addition , one in 50 people ends up with mild scalding to add to their woes			2
professor @entity38 , who led the study , said ' @entity40 , ibuprofen or a combination of both are the most common courses of treatment for respiratory tract infections			2
' clinicians should probably not advise patients to use steam inhalation in daily practice as it does not provide symptomatic benefit for acute respiratory infections and a few individuals are likely to experience mild thermal injury			1
similarly , routinely advising ibuprofen or ibuprofen and paracetamol together than just paracetamol is also not likely to be effective			1
' however our research has shown that ibuprofen is likely to help children , and those with chest infections			0
' the randomised control trial recruited 899 patients who went to their gp with respiratory tract infection symptoms such as sore throat , runny nose and a cough			2
they received different treatment types ; paracetamol , ibuprofen or a combination of both			2
patients were then told to either take it as needed or at regular intervals of four times a day and some were also told to take steam inhalation			1
little ones : the research did show that ibuprofen is likely to help children , and those with chest infections the research showed that patients were more likely to come back within a month with worsening symptoms or new symptoms if they were prescribed with ibuprofen or ibuprofen with paracetamol			1
between 50 per cent and 70 per cent of participants in the study who were prescribed ibuprofen or ibuprofen with paracetamol came back , says a report in the @entity101 ( must credit )			1
in addition to sales of paracetamol tablets , the drug is available to buy in many cold and flu remedies and can be obtained on @entity108 prescription			1
effective : @entity40 works by blocking an enzyme in the brain and spinal cord involved in the transmission of pain the @entity108 spent £ 61 million on paracetamol in 2011 for @entity116 ' patients , with £ 20.6m going on prescriptions for ibuprofen			1
the two drugs work in different , but complementary ways			0
@entity121 blocks the production of various chemicals in the body , including prostaglandins which are produced in response to injury or disease and cause inflammation			0
@entity40 blocks a different enzyme in the brain and spinal cord involved in the transmission of pain			0
@entity121 taken as pills or in liquid form numbs the site of pain and reduces inflammation , and is widely used for arthritic pain			0
it has a relatively low level of side effects , although it can cause stomach bleeding , kidney damage , allergic reactions			0
it should not be taken by people who are allergic to aspirin			0
professor @entity38 admitted the research findings were surprising and may mean that treatment with ibuprofen contributes to the progression of the illness			0
he said ' this may have something to do with the fact the ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory			0
' it is possible that the drug is interfering with an important part of the immune response and leads to prolonged symptoms or the progression of symptoms in some individuals			0
' although we have to be a bit cautious since these were surprise findings , for the moment i would personally not advise most patients to use ibuprofen for symptom control for coughs colds and sore throat			2
' the study was funded by the @entity179 ( @entity179 ) programme grants for @entity182 programme .			0

researchers say inhaling steam offers little comfort to cold suffers
study at the @entity24 finds paracetamol is most effective
the @entity108 spent £ 61 million on paracetamol in 2011 for @entity116 ' patients
