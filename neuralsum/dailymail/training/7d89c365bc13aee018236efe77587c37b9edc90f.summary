a genuine bottle of @entity1 1995 , similar to one of the forgeries @entity6 wine connoisseurs have been buying fake bottles of vintage @entity9 wine costing up to £ 7,000 a bottle , it emerged today			2
the gigantic fraud not only sheds light on the vast trade in counterfeit luxury produce , but highlights how little some self - styled ‘ experts ’ really know about wine			1
it was exposed thanks to a @entity20 - wide investigation by specialist officers working for six different police forces			0
they found that a so far unnamed @entity25 father and son were producing counterfeit bottles of @entity28 , a @entity29			1
the 1931 edition of @entity31 by @entity32 describes the upmarket beverage as ' one of the greatest wines of the world and the most perfect as well as the most expensive of @entity37			1
' it goes on to describe a ‘ forceful bouquet of violet mixed with a scent of cherry , a lively and profound ruby robe , a suaveness of exceptional finesse			0
’ but the counterfeiters still managed to make more than £ 1.8 million selling their fake produce across @entity20 , including the @entity6			0
investigators said the design on bottles were ‘ near perfect ’ and that many customers were clearly fooled			2

@entity28 is often named ‘ one of the greatest wines in the world ’			1
its @entity37 vineyard is protected under @entity9 law to ensure no other wine can use the name , and @entity28 has been given the highest level of quality classification – labelled a grand cru			1
only about four acres of vineyard are used which yield just 3,500 bottles a year , making the wine highly exclusive			0
earlier this year , three bottles of the 1990 vintage were sold at auction for just over £ 42,000 , making it officially the most expensive @entity37 in the world			1
in 2010 , the vineyard was threatened with destruction by poisoners who demanded € 1million ( £ 850,000 )			0
enquiries across @entity20 found up to 400 bottles , although there are suspicions that many more could have been sold and drunk			0
