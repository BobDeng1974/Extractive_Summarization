@entity0 believes @entity2 duty with @entity4 's under - 21s would not dent @entity6 's long - term development			1
the @entity8 manager will reserve judgement until the end of the @entity12 season on whether the @entity4 wing will be fresh enough to compete in the @entity14 with @entity16 's side			1
@entity17 came under fire for deciding to use 19 - year - old @entity6 sparingly across the @entity4 senior side 's @entity20 qualifiers against @entity22 and @entity23 , prompting widespread inquests into player burnout			1
@entity8 forward @entity6 ( @entity26 ) will be eligible to play for @entity27 at @entity2 the @entity29 youngster resumed training at @entity31 after returning from the international break @entity0 , pictured with @entity33 , believes @entity6 can benefit from playing for the @entity27 @entity34 boss @entity0 said @entity4 should take their strongest - available age - group side to next summer 's @entity38 competition - full caps like @entity6 included - fitness and freshness permitting			1
' we assess that come the end of the season , ' @entity0 said			2
' i think it is a relevant point for @entity4 : if they are going to improve internationally there has to be more focus given to the under - 21s team			2
' i think @entity16 is doing an excellent job there , allowing the players to develop and hopefully getting into the first team			0
' @entity6 is still eligible to play but i think there are a number of young players that break through that can fit into that age group and i do n't think it would do them any harm at all if they went and experienced a competition like that surrounded by top players			1
' if they were good enough to go on and win that tournament that would not hold back their development			0
' @entity6 speaks with @entity4 manager during the national team 's perfect start to @entity20 qualifying @entity6 played in @entity4 's win against @entity23 after he was left out of the starting line - up @entity77 pledged @entity79 's support for any player heading off for any level of international duty , a day after @entity76 boss @entity75 questioned the wisdom of heaping extra duties on young stars already involved in @entity4 's senior set - up			1
@entity88 boss @entity87 and @entity90 manager @entity89 challenged @entity4 's hierarchy and players to put politics aside and mount a serious title bid next summer			1
former @entity96 midfielder @entity87 said he has ' no doubt ' @entity88 star @entity98 would want to play a part in the @entity14 tournament			1
' yes he would , i have no doubt , ' said @entity87 on @entity98			2
' and if on top of that you have got a chance to win something with your national team , that 's the maximum you can aim for as a football player			0
@entity77 ( r ) has backed any international call - ups while @entity75 ( @entity26 ) is less enthusiastic ' i do n't think the debate here is if the @entity114 should play with the @entity114 or the first - team , it should be : do you want to win the tournament ? ' that 's up to you			1
i know what i would do			0
' @entity119 defender @entity89 said @entity4 must start picking from strength at under 21 level in a bid for global success at senior level			2
' there will be managers jumping up and down that they do n't want their young players having a summer of all football again which you can understand as a manager , ' said @entity89			2
' however tied with that is the international scene and we 'd love to see the under 21s team lift a trophy , the international team do well			0
@entity90 manager @entity89 insists @entity4 should make a concerted effort to win the @entity114 21 tournament ' we have to start putting things in place that we are going to play our best under 21s team , that 's the way forward for me			1
' i would like to see our international team progress			0
' we have n't won a tournament in years			0
we ( @entity90 ) have got one or two now , @entity148 in particular , around the @entity149 , and i ca n't see any reason why you 'd want to not let him play			0
that would be totally selfish but we are like that as managers			0
' but if we want our international team to succeed we have to let our young players play in the big tournaments			0
every other country seem to do that , so why ca n't we ? '			0

@entity6 could get a call - up to play for @entity27 at @entity2
@entity8 boss @entity0 would back the forward 's inclusion
@entity6 caused *controversy* after being rested for the @entity20 qualifier against @entity23 after *telling* @entity17 he was ' tired '
@entity77 , @entity87 and @entity89 support @entity172 call - ups while @entity75 is less enthusiastic
