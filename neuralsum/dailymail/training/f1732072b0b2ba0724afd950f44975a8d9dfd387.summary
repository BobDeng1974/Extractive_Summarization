by @entity0 needs round - the - clock care : @entity3 , 36 , collapsed at home and had to wait 100 minutes for an ambulance a scientist who was left brain damaged after waiting nearly two hours for an ambulance that was parked just 100 yards away has won £ 5 million compensation			1
@entity3 , 36 , had collapsed in the bedroom of her flat in @entity12 , north @entity13 , in october 2007 and was beginning to breathe abnormally when her boyfriend dialled 999			1
he told the emergency operator that his girlfriend had fallen unconscious , that her lips had turned blue and that she was in need of urgent medical help to save her life			2
but because the address had been red - flagged as ' high risk ' by the ambulance service , a crew just seconds away was ordered to wait for a police escort before attending			1
during the catastrophic delay that followed , miss @entity3 ’s boyfriend rang 999 a further two times but still no help arrived			1
by the time paramedics did reach miss @entity3 , who was working as a genetic scientist at @entity33 , @entity13 , her brain had been starved of oxygen , causing permanent damage , and she had also suffered cardiac arrest			1
she survived but is now living in a specialist hospital and is in need of round - the - clock care			0
she suffers chronic amnesia , confusion and disorientation with the result she will never work again			0
today , judge @entity45 approved a settlement against @entity47 consisting of a £ 1.4 million lump sum plus lifelong annual payments			2
he paid tribute to the support and devotion of @entity3 's mother , @entity53 , from @entity54 , @entity55 , who was at @entity13 's @entity57 for the hearing			2
afterwards , mrs @entity3 said : ' my daughter was a successful and ambitious scientist but it is so distressing that all of her aspirations and ambitions have been taken away from her because of her brain injury			0
' i was determined to ensure @entity3 had access to the best possible care and support for the rest of her life and it is such a huge relief that the settlement has been approved today			0
' clearly we would rather not be in this situation at all and nothing will ever return our daughter to how she was before			0
but it is a weight off our minds to know that she will now be able to continue to receive the care , treatment and specialist attention that she needs			0
' the thought of an ambulance crew sitting waiting round the corner while my daughter lay in her flat as her condition went from serious to life - threatening , causing irreparable damage to her brain , is still shocking and i hope no - one ever has to go through what we have			2
' @entity91 , for the trust , expressed its ' sincere apologies ' to the family for the shortcomings which had occurred and said it hoped and believed that the damages would go a long way to providing for ms @entity3 's needs in the future			1
ms @entity3 collapsed at her flat in @entity12 that she shared with her boyfriend who called 999 three times ( file picture ) lawyer @entity104 , of @entity105 , said : ' the failures by the ambulance service in this case were totally unacceptable and it was heartbreaking for her family to learn that an emergency response team was just around the corner but unable to give her the crucial treatment she needed			1
' the emergency crews eventually arrived 102 minutes after the first 999 call - but even then there was nobody senior enough on hand to administer the treatment that ms @entity3 needed			1
' it is imperative that people in @entity3 's condition are treated as quickly as possible - delays of even seconds can make a huge difference , let alone delays of well over an hour			0
' we have been working with the @entity13 ambulance service 's legal team to secure a vital settlement which will help to provide the lifetime of care and support she now needs			0
' she is currently receiving specialist rehabilitation treatment at a unit in @entity132 and , in the long term , it is hoped that @entity3 can live in her own home with a team of well - trained brain injury carers so that she can establish a permanent routine which suits her severe disability			0
