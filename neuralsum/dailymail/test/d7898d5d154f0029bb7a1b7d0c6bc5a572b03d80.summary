@entity1 duo @entity0 and @entity2 found themselves in unusual positions towards the rear of the timesheet at the end of the first practice session for the @entity9 while @entity10 posted the fastest time			1
but there was no alarm as @entity1 focused on a particular plan , with the 90 - minute session at the @entity15 hardly representative of what all the drivers will face in qualifying and the race			0
at the start of @entity25 , and with the track exceptionally dusty - a situation which will naturally improve over the weekend with use - the circuit and air temperatures were a searing 52 and 36 degrees centigrade respectively			0
@entity28 racing driver @entity10 finished first in friday 's practice session for the @entity15 @entity9 @entity10 is all smiles during the practice session at the @entity15 with qualifying and the race due to start late evening at 6pm local time , such temperatures will drop considerably			1
it meant @entity1 focused on laps rather than outright pace , with @entity2 chalking up 23 and @entity0 22 - but with their times far behind the lead car , @entity28 's @entity10			1
the @entity40 set the pace with a lap of one minute 37.827secs , two tenths of a second up on team - mate @entity44 , the @entity45 who trails reigning champion @entity0 by 13 points after the first three races of the campaign			1
@entity44 only managed 12 laps , primarily due to a loss of power with his car relatively early in the session , but with enough time in hand to ensure he returned to the circuit			2
@entity59 ' @entity58 followed the @entity28 pair , a little more than half a second off the pace			0
the @entity40 was followed by @entity62 's @entity61 and @entity63 in fourth and sixth , with @entity65 's @entity64 splitting the young pair			0
@entity68 champion @entity0 finished 16th during friday 's @entity15 practice session @entity0 looked in high spirits as he made his way into the @entity1 garage for the practice session @entity75 's @entity74 was an encouraging seventh , finishing 0.771secs down , but for the team there were further woes as @entity81 saw his session come to an end after just three minutes			1
both mclarens saw the chequered flag in @entity86 on sunday , with the team hailing that a breakthrough after their issues with new power - unit supplier @entity91 so far this season			0
but at the start of his first timed lap on the approach to turn one , @entity81 spun as the engine cut out mid-corner			2
the 35 - year - old had no choice but to abandon and take the short walk back to the garage whilst marshals rolled his car down a side road exit			0
although the car returned to the pits , @entity81 's mechanics were unable to correct the fault and get the veteran back out on track			0
@entity81 stalled his car during the practice session in what was another disappointing day for @entity75 two more rookies , @entity116 's @entity115 and @entity65 's @entity117 were eighth and ninth on the board , eight tenths of a second back , with @entity120 10th for @entity59 , just under a second down			1
given another outing by @entity124 , reserve driver @entity122 was 14th - ahead of @entity2 in 15th and @entity125 16th			2
the @entity126 again put in another credible performance alongside more experienced team - mate @entity128 , finishing a little more than four tenths of a second behind the @entity131			2
at the rear , ahead of @entity81 who naturally failed to set a time , were @entity136 's @entity135 and @entity137			0
the former was five seconds back , but more importantly 1.3secs ahead of his team - mate .			1

@entity10 finished ahead of @entity28 team - mate @entity44
@entity145 driver and @entity68 champion @entity0 finished 16th
@entity81 stalled his car right at start of the practice session
