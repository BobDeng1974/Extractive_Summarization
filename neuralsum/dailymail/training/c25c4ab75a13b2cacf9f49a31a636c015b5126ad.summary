spare pair of knickers : tick			2
extra pair of tights : tick			2
checking the location of public loos along the route i 'll be taking today : tick			2
no , this is n't my plan for when i take my toddler out			2
it 's what i have to do every time i leave the house			0
because i 'm one of those women you 'll see crossing their legs when they 're about to cough or sneeze , or who regretfully decline the opportunity to jump on a trampoline with their children			1
sound familiar ? i expect so - because some estimates say as many as one in three women have ongoing problems with their pelvic floor muscles and incontinence after their first baby			1
the more babies they have , the more interventions during labour ( such as forceps ) , the bigger any subsequent babies , or the older the mother , the more likely they are to have this problem			0
many women have ongoing problems with their pelvic floor muscles and incontinence after their first baby and yet , despite this being incredibly common , many of these women suffer in silence or , if they do seek help , struggle to get the treatment they need			1
i 'm a typical example			0
at 48 , i 've had four children , now aged 20 , 18 , 16 and 12 , and for years i have shamefully kept my secret - that any sudden pressure on my bladder can cause varying degrees of what is euphemistically described as ' leakage '			1
this condition , known as stress urinary incontinence ( @entity55 ) , is not to be confused with urge incontinence , or overactive bladder			1
this is where people have a sudden desire to pass urine and may leak before reaching the loo - thought to be because the bladder gives the wrong messages to the brain			1
@entity55 occurs when the pressure in the bladder wall becomes too great for the urethra ( the tube through which urine passes ) to withstand			1
it is usually caused by weak pelvic floor muscles , which wrap around the underside of the bladder and rectum , supporting these structures			1
some really unlucky souls have both stress and urge incontinence - known as ' mixed incontinence '			1
over the past 15 years , i have developed my own strategies for hiding my problem			0
i know i 'll leak if stress is suddenly put on my bladder			1
so i do n't lift heavy bags ; i wear pads when exercising ; i stand still when i 'm about to sneeze			0
and i never , ever , dance along to @entity89 's @entity88			0
this is a lesson learnt from when i wet myself at a wedding - one high kick caused my bladder to give way , and i spent a miserable half - hour in the ladies ' , stuffing my knickers with tissue to try to dry out			0
i do n't think anyone noticed , but my humiliation makes me blush to this day			0
some really unlucky souls have both stress and urge incontinence - known as ' mixed incontinence ' although much can be done to improve the lives of women with such conditions , specialists say that whether or not a woman gets the right help will largely be down to the initial response of her gp			1
when i finally plucked up the courage to visit a female gp a year ago , i was met with a nonchalant shrug and a , ' what do you expect ? you 've had four babies '			0
i was handed a photocopied sheet of pelvic floor exercises and advised to lose some weight - excess weight on the pelvic floor adds to its load and leads to sagging			1
when i recount this story to @entity125 , a women 's health physiotherapist at the @entity126 , @entity127 , there is a palpable intake of breath			1
' women who go to their gps reporting stress incontinence should be referred to units that can provide the specialist pelvic floor training that can vastly improve their lives , ' she says			1
i made a half - hearted attempt to lose weight and do the exercises - which basically involve eight to ten squeezes of the pelvic floor muscles three times a day - but lost interest when i read it would take at least 12 weeks to see a difference			1
it was only months later , when i heard @entity146 , a women 's health physiotherapist , on @entity148 's @entity149 , advising women like me not to take no for an answer , that i returned to my gp			2
now , it was my turn to produce a photocopied sheet - information from the @entity156 , which stressed it should never be considered normal to spend the rest of your life wetting yourself			0
' we believe nearly 70 per cent of women report a degree of urinary incontinence during pregnancy , ' says ms @entity146 , who works in the @entity165 and specialises in helping women for whom dealing with incontinence has become a way of life			1
and , after pregnancy , 38 per cent of women experience ongoing problems , according to a survey by @entity174 for the @entity156 and the @entity175			1
a staggering 75 per cent of those with problems had never sought help for this treatable condition			2
indeed , half the 1,900 respondents had never even talked about it			0
i have n't shared my ' secret ' with anyone , not even my husband			0
and my first gp visit saw me stumbling over my words			0
aside from the obvious embarrassment , there 's the fact people seem to find it acceptable to laugh at urinary incontinence - ms @entity146 cites the @entity194 sketch in which @entity196 ' old - lady character empties her bladder at inopportune moments			1
it is frustrating to see the way the problem is trivialised , says @entity202 , lead clinician in the department of urogynaecology and pelvic reconstructive surgery at @entity206 , @entity207			2
much hinges on who women first see when they seek help , he adds			2
' a female gp with children of her own is more likely to have read up on the subject and refer you on			0
but if your first contact is with a 45 - year - old , rugby - playing male , your chances of getting the right help are not so good			0
if the issue is not taken seriously at that first consultation , many women will not return			2
' all three specialists are adamant these women have every right to be seen by a specialist , whether it 's a urogynaecologist or a physiotherapist specialising in pelvic floor muscles			1
and a sheet of teach - yourself pelvic floor exercises alone is not the answer - expert guidance is needed , as some report not knowing if they are doing them correctly			1
' forty per cent of the women i see respond incredibly well to the exercises - but only when properly taught , ' says mr @entity202			2
for those who do n't respond to medication or exercise , surgery is an option ( posed by model ) another option is medication - duloxetine , which is usually prescribed alongside exercises , aims to increase the urethra 's muscle tone , so it remains closed and contracts more strongly			0
devices such as weights or cones can also be placed in the vagina to help train the pelvic floor			1
while these have their place , say ms @entity146 and ms @entity125 , they caution women should only use them under specialist guidance			2
for those who do n't respond to medication or exercise , surgery is an option			0
surgery aims to tighten or support the muscles and structures below the bladder			2
one option is tension - free vaginal tape ( @entity274 ) , where a sling of synthetic tape is used to support the urethra and bladder neck			0
but some women report needing the loo more urgently afterwards , or being unable to empty their bladder fully			1
in some cases , the tape can wear away or break up into fragments and cut into surrounding tissue , causing pain , including during sex			0
an alternative is colposuspension , which involves making an incision in the lower abdomen , lifting up the neck of the bladder and stitching it in this lifted position			0
this provides better support for the bladder neck , so it stays closed under pressure			0
but what of those women reading this who have yet to give birth ? luckily , things have moved on since i had my first child			2
during that labour , i had an episiotomy , a surgical cut in the perineum , between the vagina and the anus			0
research indicates this procedure may be one of the risk factors for stress incontinence , and the rate of episiotomies has dropped from 55 per cent in the @entity320 to 15 per cent today			1
it was originally thought such a cut could help women avoid pelvic floor problems , by preventing serious tears extending into the anal muscle			1
however , it 's thought the body is actually designed to tear naturally away from the sphincter during labour			0
thankfully , experts agree it 's never too late to put this condition right			0
for a start , a 10 per cent weight loss in overweight women results in a 50 per cent improvement in symptoms , says mr @entity202			2
after returning to my gp , i was referred to a group session at my local hospital last month			0
we were talked through correct pelvic floor exercises and will each have a personal follow - up appointment with a continence nurse to check our technique			1
if i have n't got the hang of things by then , i 'll be offered further instruction until the right treatment for me is found			0
if all goes to plan , you wo n't keep me off the trampoline this summer			0
