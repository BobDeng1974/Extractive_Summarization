by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:31 est , 2 february 2014 @entity3 : 04:35 est , 3 february 2014 @entity5 's angrier version of famous clairvoyant groundhog @entity6 made his opinion of @entity9 quite clear when he leaped from the mayor 's arms and tried to flee a @entity13 event on sunday			1
@entity14 , as he 's called , wriggled out of the mayor 's grip after predicting six more miserable weeks of winter this morning just like his country cousin			1
but unlike @entity6 , @entity18 has a rather nasty reputation			1
' @entity18 and my predecessor did n’t always get along , let ’s be honest about that			2
but i ’m hoping we can start a new day , a new relationship here , ' joked @entity9			0
' i ’m reaching out a hand to chuck and i hope he will consider shaking it rather than doing other things			0
' making amends : ' now @entity18 , what about this winter thing , @entity18 ? we can work something out , can ¿ t we ? ' de @entity9 joked @entity18 did n't bite the new mayor , but he was n't doling out his forecast without exacting at least a little payment			1
as @entity9 slowly began to hold up the furball for a photo - op , he never quite got a grip			1
seeing an opportunity in the @entity9 's butterfingers , @entity18 leaped the impressive distance between the 6 - foot - 5 mayor 's waist all the way to the ground			1
he landed within his pen , luckily , and the fast reactions of his @entity63 caregiver kept him from infiltrating the crowd			0
ouch ! @entity14 has a history of mayoral hatred and once famously bit @entity67 old wounds : after the 2009 attack , @entity70 held up his foe with a smile but their relationship remained icy for the rest of @entity70 's mayoralty @entity79 seemed amused by the whole fiasco and joked afterward : ' now @entity18 , what about this winter thing , @entity18 ? we can work something out , ca n’t we ? ' @entity23 has spoken - and it is not good news			1
@entity88 's famed groundhog emerged from his lair in front of thousands of fans around daybreak sunday forecasting six more weeks of what already has felt like a brutally long and cold winter			1
legend has it that if the furry rodent sees his shadow on february 2 winter will last another month - and - a - half			0
if he does n't see it , spring will come early			0
prediction : @entity23 is held by @entity100 after emerging from his burrow sunday , feb. 2 , 2014 , on @entity23 in @entity102 , @entity88 , to see his shadow and forecast six more weeks of winter weather no end to winter in sight : @entity25 handler @entity105 holds @entity23 after he saw his shadow predicting six more weeks of winter during 128th annual @entity25 festivities on february 2 , 2014 in @entity102 , @entity88 early morning : @entity23 is held by @entity100 after emerging from his burrow on @entity23 in @entity102 , @entity88 , to see his shadow and forecast six more weeks of winter weather on sunday in reality , @entity6 's prediction is decided ahead of time by a group called the @entity113 , whose members don top hats and tuxedos for the annual @entity25 ceremony on @entity23 , the tiny hill in the town for which he 's named about 65 miles northeast of @entity121			1
the prediction this year fell on the same day as @entity123			0
the closest the game previously came to coinciding with @entity25 was in 2009 , when the just - down - the - road @entity125 defeated the @entity127 27 - 23 in the @entity123 , the night before @entity6 's forecast			1
the annual event , made world famous by the 1993 @entity132 comedy ' @entity25 ' draws thousands of tourists from as far afield as @entity134 and @entity135			0
a version of @entity23 has been making weather predictions since 1887 - but since the release of the popular movie crowds of up to 30,000 have made their way to @entity88 to witness the ceremony			1
behold : @entity23 is held by handler @entity105 after emerging from his burrow sunday , february 2 , 2014 , on @entity23 in @entity102 , @entity88 , to see his shadow and forecast six more weeks of winter weather @entity23 is held by @entity100 , left , as @entity147 vice president @entity146 , center , reads the weather proclamation on sunday - condemning everyone to six more weeks of winter what are you saying ? @entity23 is held by @entity100 , ( left ) , as he gives his weather prediction to @entity155 president @entity154 , ( right ) , after emerging from his burrow on @entity23 in @entity102 on sunday @entity155 co-handler @entity105 holds the weather predicting groundhog , @entity23 , as he is surrounded by photographers after the club said @entity6 did not see his shadow legend has it that if the furry rodent sees his shadow on february 2 , winter will last another month - and - a - half			1
if he does n't see it , spring will come early the game this year featuring the @entity166 and @entity167 at @entity168 in @entity169 , @entity170 , will be the @entity123 's 48th installment , while @entity6 has been predicting the weather since 1886			2
this year 's @entity25 celebration marks a winter that has brought extreme cold to stretches of the country wholly unaccustomed to it , as well as a snow and ice storm that paralyzed @entity181 and other @entity183 cities			2
according to the legend , if it is cloudy when @entity6 emerges the groundhog will leave his burrow , which means that winter will soon end			1
if @entity6 appears frightened and sees his own shadow - he will retreat back into his burrow - meaning that winter will continue for six more weeks			1
however , most weather analysis of @entity6 's predictions have proved that he is on average , inaccurate			2
' the groundhog has shown no talent for predicting the arrival of spring , especially in recent years , ' according to the @entity196 in @entity197 , @entity198			0
' @entity6 's competitor groundhogs across the nation fared no better			2
' professional predictions : this map reveals when @entity203 believes that the winter will end across the nation the center found that from 1988 to 2012 , the groundhog was right 10 times and wrong 15 times about winter continuing for more than six weeks after february 2			0
indeed , last year , @entity6 did not see his shadow , which meant an early spring			2
what in face occurred was a slightly warmer than average february but a chillier march			0
since 1887 , @entity6 has seen his shadow 100 times and has not seen it 17 times - predicting an early spring			2
not everyone finds the tradition to be fair on @entity6 though			0
@entity216 characterizes the handling of @entity23 as inhumane , as the animal is on constant display and not able to hibernate for the winter			2
much loved film : the 1993 comedy starring @entity132 has become recognized as being one of the actor 's finest roles brutal winter so far : snowrolls fill the @entity227 near @entity228 in @entity229 , @entity230 , during last weeks latest polar vortex blast from the north freezing : @entity233 takes advantage of a snow storm to enjoy some cross country skiing around @entity237 during the first polar vortex that his in the third week of january the group has asked that @entity6 be retired			1
' we think that using a cyber shadow - detector is a great alternative to yanking a frightened groundhog out of a fake burrow every february and waving him around in front of a boisterous crowd as cameras flash in his eyes , ' @entity216 noted			0
' groundhogs avoid human contact and spend their days digging and burrowing			0
in february , they should be midway through their winter hibernation , not dodging the paparazzi			0
' in their defense , the @entity113 says @entity6 is a very special groundhog and he gets his longevity from drinking a secret punch			0
he drinks it every year , at a summer picnic , and it is said that one sip gives him seven more years of life			0
@entity113 member @entity262 ( r ) takes a picture of a group of visitors with a statue of @entity23 the groundhog on the eve of groundhog day during the @entity25 celebration in @entity102 , @entity88 @entity271 takes a souvenir picture of @entity273 , @entity274 , and @entity275 of @entity121 , @entity88 on the eve of groundhog day during the @entity25 celebration in @entity102 , @entity88 @entity6 is the most famous of a small group of groundhogs said to forecast the weather , including @entity14 in @entity5 and @entity281 in @entity181			1
the @entity196 has put @entity6 's forecasts to the test and found them sorely lacking , declaring the groundhog has ' no predictive skill			2
' ' it really is n't a ` bright ' idea to take a measure such as a groundhog 's shadow and use it as a predictive meteorological tool for the entire @entity292 , ' the data center says on its website , helpfully if somewhat obviously .			0

the @entity13 version of @entity296 also famously bit @entity29 's finger in 2009
@entity18 squirmed out of @entity9 's grip and leaped to the ground before a *zoo* *caretaker* *scooped* him up
@entity23 also predicts no end in sight to long , cold winter
@entity6 emerged from his burrow in @entity88 at 7.25 am on sunday morning to see his shadow
tens of thousands of *people* traveled from around the world to witness the ceremony in @entity314
