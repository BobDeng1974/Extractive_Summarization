by @entity1 reporter last updated at 2:55 pm on 20th june 2011 @entity2 , 60 , was loading a crashed @entity3 onto his recovery truck on a slip road off the @entity6 when a @entity7 skidded on ice and hit him a tow truck driver was mown down by a runaway car only to be left dying in the road - as other motorists drove round him			1
@entity2 , 60 , was loading a crashed @entity3 onto his vehicle on a motorway when a @entity7 skidded on ice and ploughed into him			1
but instead of stopping to help , drivers in other cars swerved round mr @entity2 as he lay face down on the inside lane of a slip road on the @entity6 near @entity22 , @entity23			1
according to witnesses , some drivers had so little regard for the dying man , they even edged their cars past the golf which had hit him because they did not want to be held up			1
mr @entity2 , from @entity29 , who once worked as a roadie for @entity31 and @entity32 was eventually attended to by passers - by including a doctor and then an ambulance crew but was pronounced dead on arrival at @entity37			1
the shocking ' walk on by ' scenario emerged as a jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing at an inquest into mr @entity2 's death which occurred in december 2009			1
@entity44 , who was travelling to work , told the @entity47 hearing : ' it was horrific			1
i could n't believe my eyes as i witnessed motorists manoeuvring around him and driving off without stopping			1
' they had little or no regard for the man			1
it appeared all they were bothered about was getting past and getting on their journey			1
' they were swerving past the tailgate of the @entity7			1
it was like a game			1
i found it very disturbing			1
' mrs @entity44 said she stopped her car at an angle to block the traffic and then went over to mr @entity2 who was said to be motionless			1
instead of stopping to help , drivers in other cars swerved round mr @entity2 as he lay face down on the inside lane of a slip road on the @entity6 near @entity22 , @entity23 mr @entity2 , a grandfather of eight , had been loading the @entity3 , which had crashed into a barrier due to the weather conditions , onto his truck near junction 6 when he was hit by the @entity78			2
police had earlier attended the crash and advised the @entity3 driver , @entity81 , to stand behind the crash barriers but had left after seeing @entity84 officers arrive			2
@entity84 officer @entity85 told the court he and his colleague @entity87 had twice asked if mr @entity81 would like them to stay but he had declined			2
' we also offered him a foil blanket and told him there was a telephone box he could call and we would be back within ten to 15 minutes			2
there was no reason for us to stay at the scene , ' he added			2
the @entity78 driver , @entity95 , 23 , a veterinary student from @entity96 , was twice interviewed by police but no action was taken			2
she denied having driven over snow - covered chevron markings that separate junction 7 from the motorway network			2
mr @entity2 drove stars such as @entity32 and @entity31 , right , across @entity104 delivering their stage equipment but lawyers will now reopen the files after coroner @entity108 asked the @entity109 to review the decision			1
mr @entity108 said he also would write to the chief constable of @entity112 and to the @entity84 asking them to look at their protocols and ensure the safety of recovery drivers who are called to pick up cars following motorway crashes			2
he said officers from both organisations who were called to the scene had obeyed their organisations ' procedures			2
but he added : ' it does seem to me that , in the prevailing weather conditions , the emergency services ought to have considered not just the safety of the driver whose car had been involved in a crash but also the safety of anyone who is required to recover the driver of that vehicle			0
' as well as working for @entity139 , mr @entity2 drove stars such as @entity141 , @entity31 and @entity32 across @entity104 delivering their stage equipment			1
@entity142 , a partner at @entity143 , which is to file a civil action on behalf of mr @entity2 's family against the @entity78 driver , said : ' the family would welcome a decision from the @entity109 that they will now prosecute			0
' we expect to have a response from the cps in a few weeks			0
the situation was the police and the @entity84 had responded to the car that had spun off the road			0
@entity2 was clearing that damaged vehicle when he was killed			0
' when he got there only the damaged vehicle and the driver were at the scene			0
there is currently no protocol in place as to whether the police should have stayed at the scene for the protection of recovery drivers			0
' we do n't know what the reason is for the unlawful killing verdict			0
we asked the coroner what the background was to the verdict but the jury did n't record it in the inquisition so there is no explanation for it			0
' mr @entity2 also worked for @entity141			1
his widow , @entity181 , said that her late husband ' got to know quite a few of the celebrities , who all really valued the work he did for them ' mr @entity2 's widow , @entity181 , 38 , said after the verdict : ' the whole family has been absolutely devastated by @entity2 's death			0
at least the inquest provided answers as to precisely what happened on the day @entity2 died			0
' we now want lessons to be learned from the mistakes that were made so that no - one else doing the job @entity2 died dies in the same circumstances			0
' ' @entity2 lived for his work and it was typical of him that he went to this job when really his area of work was really dealing with the recovery of heavy goods vehicles			0
he probably went because he knew he 'd have been able to help but his dedication brought about his death			0
' @entity2 got to know quite a few of the celebrities , who all really valued the work he did for them			0
' he was married before to someone also called @entity181 who sadly died from cancer and when he got the call on tour in @entity104 to say she had become critically ill , @entity32 paid for him to be flown home immediately			1
that 's how much people thought of him			0
' he was so kind and generous , once when he was in @entity219 just after the troubles there , he came home with no shoes ! he 'd given them to a @entity219 who he said ' needed them more than me '			0
that was my @entity2 ; he 'd do anything for anyone			0

victim once worked as roadie for stars such as @entity31 and @entity32
