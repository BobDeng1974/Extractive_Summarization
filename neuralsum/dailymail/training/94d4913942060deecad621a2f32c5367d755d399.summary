this is the pregnant teacher who schoolboy @entity2 wanted to murder in front of other children			1
the crazed 16 - year - old fantasised about brutally taking the life of @entity7 ’s unborn child			1
@entity2 also intended to target @entity8 , his head of year , in the atrocity he spent three years meticulously planning			1
he stabbed @entity12 teacher @entity11 , 61 , to death in her classroom , but was not able to carry out his aim of attacking the other two staff members			1
she declined to comment from her family home in @entity25 yesterday			0
on the morning he murdered mrs @entity11 , @entity2 told a girl in school he intended to stab miss @entity7 in the stomach ‘ so as to kill her unborn child ’			1
the court heard ‘ he had not had the slightest problem ’ with the teacher and there was no explanation as to why he should want to target her			2
mrs @entity7 had been a pupil at @entity38 before returning as a teacher			1
she was close to mrs @entity11 , and her tribute to the much - loved ‘ mother of the school ’ was read in court			1
it said : ‘ @entity11 was such an amazing woman and teacher			2
she taught me when i was a pupil and supported me in my career since i have been teaching at @entity38			0
@entity11 loved her job and wanted all her kids to work hard and reach their full potential			2
’ murder : @entity2 ( left ) was jailed for life with a minimum of 20 years for killing @entity11 ( right ) in @entity53 the court heard that @entity2 told fellow pupils mr @entity8 , an assistant headmaster , was also on his seemingly random hit list			1
again there was no known reason for his implacable hatred , although it did emerge that mr @entity8 had spoken to @entity2 two months before the murder after he defied a ban on going to a bowling trip imposed by mrs @entity11 for not doing homework			1
when mrs @entity11 came into the meeting , @entity2 stood up to walk out			1
this led to another meeting the next day with the teenager ’s parents			2
it is not clear whether this incident increased his hatred of mr @entity8			2
teenage killer : @entity2 , 16 , sits in the dock at @entity74 during his sentencing hearing on monday , @entity2 was given a life term and told he would stay locked up for a minimum of 20 years			1
passing sentence at @entity74 , mr @entity78 said experts considered him such a danger that he might die behind bars			0
his crime has shocked the public , leading to concerns over why he was never reported to the authorities			0
yesterday @entity87 announced that an inquiry , dubbed a ‘ learning lessons review ’ , would be held to report on ‘ all circumstances ’ surrounding the tragedy			0
no remorse : @entity93 ( left ) had an image of the @entity95 ( right ) at the top of his @entity98 page @entity2 messaged his friends on @entity98 about his intentions , and his irrational fury at mrs @entity11 was known to the school and his parents			1
in the attack , which it emerged he spent three years planning , he brought a large kitchen knife to school and stabbed mrs @entity11 repeatedly in the back and neck from behind as she worked at her desk			1
teenagers fled screaming and the teacher staggered into a corridor where she was helped into a side room by a brave colleague who put herself between @entity2 and his victim			2
the murderer returned to his desk , saying ‘ @entity120 ’ , and waited calmly to be arrested			0
it later emerged the then 15 - year - old had sent chilling messages on @entity98 in which he spoke of ‘ brutally killing ’ mrs @entity11 and spending the rest of his life behind bars			1
in one post he wrote she deserved ‘ more than death more than pain ’			0
scene : the classroom at @entity20 in @entity53 , where @entity2 killed mrs @entity11 in april the inquiry will be carried out by the @entity133 and headed by its independent chairman @entity134 , a national expert on child protection issues with more than 30 years ’ experience			1
mrs @entity134 said : ‘ our thoughts and deepest sympathies remain with all those affected by this tragic event			2
‘ following this unprecedented incident the members of the @entity133 have already agreed to work with the school and other agencies , to look into all of the circumstances surrounding the incident , and help with any learning for all agencies involved			0
’ a decision on whether to hold a serious case review – a more formal form of investigation – has not yet been made			0
the safeguarding board inquiry team will involve members from the council , police , health and education services			2
a spokesman said it was ‘ very likely ’ that the team ’s report will be published , although it is ‘ not a requirement ’ to do so			0
‘ they will be looking at everything and talking to everybody involved , ’ said the spokesman			0
on the morning of the murder @entity2 showed other pupils knives and told them he intended to attack the teacher , but no one took him seriously enough to report him			1
victim 's family : ( from left ) mrs @entity11 's daughters @entity175 and @entity177 and widower @entity178 at @entity74 following the sentencing of @entity2 for the teacher 's murder although his extreme dislike of mrs @entity11 was known to the school it is not clear whether any members of staff had heard talk about his murder plan			1
too harsh : @entity189 , chairman of the @entity190 , said the sentence given to murderer @entity19 was too long the headmaster of @entity20 in @entity53 was not available for comment			1
public fury over the crime was yesterday fuelled by comments from a senior youth justice campaigner , who said the sentence was too long			2
@entity189 , the chairman of the @entity190 ( @entity190 ) umbrella group of charities and campaign groups , said : ‘ i do n’t think a child – and he was a child – should get a life sentence because they are young , their brain is not mature and a life sentence is indeterminate , it could last forever			0
i think no other western @entity207 country would impose a life sentence on a teenager			0
‘ do we want him to be rehabilitated ? do we want him to leave prison the lowest risk possible of causing more harm to others ? yes			0
how long do we need to achieve that , rather than how long do we need to punish him for			0
‘ we do need to punish him but i think to punish him for longer than he ’s been alive for is disproportionate			0
’ but she received an internet backlash from parents who supported a long prison term			0
@entity224 commented : ‘ mrs @entity11 taught me 20 years ago , my daughter was two classrooms away when this happened			1
too light a sentence ? not at all … he was on his way to attack other teachers and one of those was pregnant ! he deserved to be sectioned for life to be totally honest			0
’ @entity234 , the mother of a pupil ‘ in the next classroom ’ , also welcomed the lengthy sentence			0
she said the family have to ‘ live with this everyday ’ and the parents have been left to ‘ pick up the pieces			0

@entity19 killed @entity12 teacher @entity243 , 61 , in @entity53 in april
but 16 - year - old had also said he would kill head of year @entity8
teenager also wanted to slay pregnant languages teacher @entity7
police , *prosecutors* and council *insist* no one could have *foreseen* killing
