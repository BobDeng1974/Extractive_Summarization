move escalates row over independence of @entity4 law by @entity6 reporter last updated at 9:50 am on 20th june 2011 convicted child killer : @entity8 is taking his fight to the @entity10 a convicted @entity4 child killer - who slit his girlfriend 's throat repeatedly with a knife - could soon be released by @entity15 's @entity10			1
@entity8 is trying to get his 2005 conviction for killing his girlfriend @entity8 , 14 , overturned			1
he claims his trial was unfair as he was denied access to a lawyer during police interview and says evidence taken from that interview was ' crucial ' to the @entity25 's case against him			1
in april , the @entity27 in @entity28 ruled his life sentence should stand , and refused to refer his case to the @entity10 in @entity31			1
and so his legal team is taking their fight directly to the @entity15 capital - in a move which has escalated the row between the @entity4 government and @entity38 over the independence of @entity4 law			1
@entity4 ’s first minister @entity41 has accused the @entity10 of undermining his country 's law			1
it could see @entity8 freed - because @entity15 judges have previously ruled the @entity4 system of letting suspects be held and questioned for six hours without access to a lawyer breaches the @entity50			1
@entity8 , 22 , was handed a life sentence in 2005 after he was found guilty of murdering @entity8 , 14 , in @entity52 , @entity53 , in 2003			2
he has always maintained his innocence and said his trial was unfair because , under the @entity4 legal system , he was not allowed to have a lawyer for six hours			1
the system has since been declared a breach of human rights under the @entity61 ruling			2
judges in @entity31 upheld an appeal by teenager @entity64 , whose assault conviction was based on evidence gained before he spoke to his lawyer			2
his lawyers argued this was a breach of his human rights			2
in 2009 , he was convicted at @entity72 of two assaults and a breach of the peace following an incident in the city in may 2007			2
murdered : @entity8 ( pictured ) had her throat repeatedly slit by @entity8 even though the @entity81 is the highest court of criminal appeal in @entity4 , it was overruled by the @entity10 on a constitutional issue			1
this was because the need to consider @entity86 human rights legislation was written into the @entity87 - the piece of @entity38 legislation which established devolution			2
in light of the @entity61 ruling , 867 cases were abandoned , including 60 serious cases , nine of which were @entity81 cases			2
contrary to the landmark @entity99 decision , the @entity27 in @entity28 ruled in april that @entity8 's conviction should stand			0
lord justice general , @entity102 and two other judges dismissed @entity8 's claim that his human rights had been breached			0
undermined : @entity4 's first minister @entity41 has accused the @entity10 of undermining @entity4 law and so @entity8 ’s legal team is going directly to the @entity10 in @entity31 , which @entity4 ’s first minister @entity41 has accused of undermining @entity4 law , to plead ' exceptional circumstances '			1
@entity109 , head of a @entity4 law firm , told the @entity111 : ' the @entity10 probably will call this in and if so , they have to release him			1
' @entity41 knows it ’s not going to be popular , so it could not have gone better for him ... @entity15 judges freeing a @entity4 child murderer			1
' @entity15 barrister @entity117 , who acted for @entity64 when he won his landmark ruling , said @entity8 ’s case was very similar			0
in june 2003 , @entity8 murdered @entity120 in woods near @entity124 's @entity123 path , between their homes in the @entity128 and @entity129 area of @entity52 , @entity53			0
victim : @entity8 ( pictured ) was just 14 - years - old when she was killed by her boyfriend @entity8 her throat was slit by between 12 and 20 blows with a knife , and extensive mutilation of the face and body was inflicted after death			0
@entity120 had failed to return home after going to meet @entity8			0
he claimed she had not arrived , and he spent the evening with friends			0
he said he later learned from @entity120 's family that she was missing and joined in a search			0
he claimed he was alerted by his dog jumping up at @entity145 , and went over the wall to find @entity120 's body			0
but other people who were there said he had gone straight to a break in the wall and made the discovery			0
the prosecution at his trial asserted that , as the killer , he had known the body was there and had pretended to find it by accident			0
@entity8 was found guilty by a jury and given a life sentence			0
decision : @entity8 is taking his fight to the @entity10 in @entity31			0
