by @entity0 last updated at 12:30 am on 2nd september 2011 for parents worried about lending their precious car to their even more precious teenage children , it sounds like the answer to their prayers			2
an electronic system will be fitted to new @entity9 cars from next year that will force young motorists to drive safely when they ask to borrow the family motor			2
the system will limit the car ’s top speed and even stop teenagers turning the volume up too high on the stereo			1
key to safety : @entity9 's @entity21 system will allow parents to limit the speed of the family car when their teenage children drive it the safety feature , which has already been dubbed ‘ teenage mode ’ , springs into action when the young driver uses a special second car key			1
officially known as @entity21 , the system is programmable by parents , allowing them to set a top speed of between 45mph and 80mph			1
once the car reaches a certain speed , a chime sounds , and the car plays a spoken warning to slow down			1
the system also features an early warning when the driver is running low on fuel			2
neat : the @entity21 system uses programmable keys another safety feature is ‘ emergency assistance ’ in the event of a crash serious enough to trigger the passenger airbags			1
if there is such a collision , the car ’s on - board computer will send a message through the mobile phone network to the emergency services			2
the message will include the co-ordinates of the accident			2
it is not only ‘ boy racers ’ whose antics will be curtailed , but teenage girl drivers , too			0
@entity9 cites research which shows that while excessive speed is the cause of 30 per cent of accidents involving young male drivers , it is also the cause of 21 per cent of accidents with young female drivers			1
@entity74 , @entity9 ’s chief technical officer , said of @entity21 : ‘ it ’s targeted at young drivers , though it is useful for fleet operators as well			1
’ the car maker said that it had feared the ‘ electronic spy ’ would prove unpopular with teenagers , but initial trials in @entity82 have proven otherwise			0
it was found that parents were more willing to lend their car with the safety feature operating			0
‘ we were concerned that children would see it as @entity90 watching them , ’ said mr @entity74			0
‘ but they are now getting more access to the vehicle			0
and from a parental perspective , there is peace of mind			0
’ the @entity21 system will be fitted to new @entity9 cars from next year @entity9 said research shows that 46 per cent of parents say speeding is their biggest worry while their offspring are driving , followed by talking on mobile phones while at the wheel ( 37 per cent ) and their child being distracted by others in the car ( 35 per cent )			1
@entity111 , crash and safety research manager at safety testing company @entity114 , said it was possible insurance companies might reduce young drivers ’ insurance premiums for using the system			0
@entity21 will be introduced into all new @entity9 in @entity120 next year			1
the move was welcomed by a spokesman for @entity123 , who said : ‘ we work closely with the other emergency services to try to educate young people about the dangers of speeding			0
‘ it can sometimes come down to peer pressure , but the results can be devastating for themselves , their passengers , families and other road users			0
‘ our staff can also be affected by responding to calls where youngsters have been killed or seriously injured and it is even sadder because a lot of the most serious incidents could be avoided			0

@entity21 also issues *seatbelt* and speed warnings
