@entity0 is still going strong at 33 but after the pulverising he got from @entity2 on friday he might be thinking fonder thoughts of the time when he can put his feet up			2
the big @entity5 pounded down 22 aces that helped knock @entity0 out of the @entity7 7 - 6 7 - 5 and potentially put a severe dent in the great @entity9 ’ s designs on regaining the world number one spot at the end of the season			1
@entity0 was left hoping that @entity14 would do him a favour by knocking @entity16 out of the quarter final as the old rivals duelled to join @entity2 in the semi-finals along with @entity20			1
@entity0 was beaten 7 - 6 7 - 5 by @entity2 in the quarter - finals of the @entity7 the big serving @entity5 had to too much firepower on one of his best performances against a leading player @entity0 shakes hands with his conqueror @entity2 after crashing out of the tournament in straight sets @entity2 repeated the form that saw him reach the semi-finals at @entity32 this year 1 @entity16 9190 - qualified 2 @entity0 8700 - qualified 3 @entity33 * 6835 - withdrew 4 @entity34 4895 - qualified 5 @entity14 4475 - qualified 6 @entity20 4465 - qualified 7 @entity35 4445 8 @entity2 4200 9 @entity36 4150 - qualified ( as @entity38 champion ) the @entity39 had earlier guaranteed his place in the @entity41 and , if @entity0 had held true to the formbook and won his match , the whole field would have been automatically decided with @entity35 and @entity45 completing the eight - man field at the @entity47			1
the only person who could stop them was @entity2 , who has slipped down the ‘ @entity53 ’ due to a late season slump that suggested he would be doing nothing more than turning up as the on - site first reserve at the @entity41			2
yet he made a nonsense of recent results by hitting @entity0 off the court with an excellent performance which , while rooted in his @entity59 - given serving ability , was backed up by more solid groundstroking than usual			2
the @entity9 legend was hoping to reclaim the world no 1 spot before his 14 - game winning streak was ended @entity0 's wife @entity65 watches his game with her face partially covered in @entity68 @entity0 can still mathematically finish no 1 after the @entity69 but @entity16 is favourite @entity0 can still attain the world number one slot regardless of any outcome in @entity68 , and has to hope that his legs can carry him through to the end of the season			1
he might have been a little sluggish as , like many others players , weariness is setting in at this stage of the year , but even had he been at his most sprightly he would have struggled against the bombs being delivered by the 6 ’ 5 ” slugger from @entity82			0
@entity2 played an outstanding tiebreak and looked safe on serve until 4 - 5 in the second , when @entity0 created a set point which was saved by an ace			1
there are times these days when the @entity9 gets over-exasperated when things are not going his way , and he looked mighty displeased by how helpless he was against against his opponent ’s golden arm			0
in the next game the @entity5 broke with a piercing backhand pass and then served it out to keep his ambitions of a first appearance at the @entity47 alive			0
@entity0 has the consolation of a weekend off to gather himself for both @entity99 and the @entity101 final against @entity102 in @entity103 that comes the weekend after that , but he wanted to keep the pressure up on @entity16			2
losing is not something he has been familiar with of late , going undefeated since the @entity38 with a run of fourteen consecutive victories that has carried him to the brink of yet another remarkable career achievement			0
@entity2 will play @entity20 in the semi-finals as he looks to end the year on a high @entity0 has won a record 17 grand slam finals in his career - with the last coming at @entity114 reigning world no 1 is favourite to retain his ranking and plays @entity14 in the last eight @entity20 became the sixth man to qualify ( or seventh if you include the absent @entity33 ) and it will be the fifth consecutive time he has finished the season in the world ’s top eight			1
he did so by beating @entity125 6 - 7 6 - 4 6 - 4 , this being the twelfth consecutive time he has beaten the towering @entity127 , who concluded his most successful season on a note of gut - wrenching disappointment			0
@entity20 , with his easy power of both flanks , will consider himself to be among those most unlucky to have been around in the era of the so - called @entity136 to which @entity14 now seeks re-entry			0
although his mental power has never matched the physical prowess of his game , had he been born ten years it is very possible that he would have won a @entity142 by now , rather than just having reached a solitary @entity32 final .			0

@entity2 defeated @entity0 7 - 6 , 7 - 5 at the @entity7
@entity9 was aiming to reclaim the no 1 ranking by reaching @entity68 final
*current* world no 1 @entity16 faces @entity14 in other quarter - final
