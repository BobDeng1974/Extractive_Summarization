take a look at the amount of fuel for star formation in the universe , compared to the number of stars , and you 'll notice something strange - there should be 10 times as many stars as there are			1
it 's a problem that has perplexed scientists , but now a study claims to have an answer , saying that the heat in star - forming clouds may be hindering stellar formation			2
they say that the temperatures are likely too hot to allow reasonable amounts of star formation , which leads to the observed lower number of stars we see in the cosmos today			2
researchers at the @entity27 and @entity28 have proposed a new theory for the lack of stars			1
based on the amount of stellar fuel there should be 10 times as many			1
but the reason is because temperatures stop them forming			1
the @entity38 image is shown here for a star to form , it relies on a cloud of gas to cool sufficiently so that it can gather into the large mass required for stellar formation			1
in particular , intracluster gas - that near the centre of a galaxy cluster - is normally a prime region for stellar formation			0
but just a handful of stars in are born every year in some galaxies , despite an abundance of this gas , so there must be something hindering the gas from cooling and forming stars			1
last month astronomers discovered stars forming in a remote region of the @entity61 not thought possible before			2
the stars were seen in a cloud of molecular gas 16,000 light - years below the flattened disc of our galaxy - further than any others ever seen			0
and if any planets were to form around these stars , inhabitants would see the entire glory of the spiral galaxy above them in their night sky			2
the amazing discovery - led by dr @entity76 of the @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79 - marks the first time that star - forming clusters that are part of the @entity61 have been found this far from our galaxy			1
‘ this is the first time astronomers have found stars being born in such a remote location , ’ said dr @entity76			0
‘ our work shows that the space around the galaxy is a lot less empty than we thought			0
’ ' the amount of fuel for star formation outpaces the amount of stars 10 times , so these clusters should be really star - rich , ' said dr @entity103 , a @entity38 fellow in @entity27 's ( @entity27 ) @entity104			1
' you really need some mechanism to prevent gas from cooling , otherwise the universe would have 10 times as many stars			1
' the theory proposed by the researchers from @entity27 and @entity28 suggests a number of reasons for why this is so			1
for some galaxy clusters , the researchers say , the intracluster gas may simply be too hot - on the order of hundreds of millions of degrees @entity120			2
even if one region experiences some cooling , the intensity of the surrounding heat would keep that region from cooling further - an effect known as conduction			0
' for these hotter clusters , they 're stuck in this hot state , and will never cool and form stars , ' dr @entity103 says			1
' once you get into this very high - temperature regime , cooling is really inefficient , and they 're stuck there forever			0
' he added to @entity139 that maybe , over tens of billions of years , they would cool down enough for stars to form			1
dr @entity103 told @entity139 that one of the only clusters observed to be ' cool ' enough to allow rapid stellar formation was the @entity144 , shown here			1
' this system was identified in the paper as the only cluster that appears to be undergoing a massive cooling - induced starburst , ' he said			0
meanwhile , for so - called ' cool core ' galaxy clusters , the gas near the center may be cool enough to form some stars			1
however , a portion of this cooled gas may rain down into a central black hole , which then spews out hot material that serves to reheat the surroundings , preventing many stars from forming - an effect the team terms ' precipitation - driven feedback			1
' ' some stars will form , but before it gets too out of hand , the black hole will heat everything back up -- it 's like a thermostat for the cluster , ' dr @entity103 said			2
' the combination of conduction and precipitation - driven feedback provides a simple , clear picture of how star formation is governed in galaxy clusters			0
' dr @entity103 also explained to @entity139 that , if a human were to venture into one of these hot clusters , they ' probably would n't feel hot , because the particles are very low density			0
' ' so the heat exchange between your body and the hot gas would be very slow , ' he added			0
' you 'd likely be killed by the lack of oxygen and extreme low pressure much faster			0
' the team collected data from the @entity188 ( illustration shown ) and the @entity190 - an observatory in @entity192 that searches for far - off massive galaxy clusters			0
dr @entity103 and his colleagues compared their theoretical framework to observations of distant galaxy clusters , and found that their theory matched the observed differences between clusters			2
the team collected data from the @entity188 and the @entity190 - an observatory in @entity192 that searches for far - off massive galaxy clusters			0
the researchers compared their theoretical framework with the gas cooling times of every known galaxy cluster , and found that clusters filtered into two populations - very slowly cooling clusters , and clusters that are cooling rapidly , closer to the rate predicted by the group as a critical threshold			2
by using the theoretical framework , dr @entity103 says researchers may be able to predict the evolution of galaxy clusters , and the stars they produce			2
' we 've built a track that clusters follow , ' dr @entity103 said			0
' the nice , simple thing about this framework is that you 're stuck in one of two modes , for a very long time , until something very catastrophic bumps you out , like a head - on collision with another cluster			0
' the researchers hope to look deeper into the theory to see whether the mechanisms regulating star formation in clusters also apply to individual galaxies			1
preliminary evidence , he says , suggests that is the case			0
' if we can use all this information to understand why or why not stars form around us , then we 've made a big step forward , ' dr @entity103 said			1
this @entity38 image of galaxy @entity246 reveals the fine , thread - like filamentary structures in the gas surrounding the galaxy			0
the red filaments are composed of cool gas being suspended by a magnetic field , and are surrounded by the 100 - million - degree gas in the center of the @entity257 galaxy cluster			0

researchers at the @entity27 and @entity28 have proposed a new theory for the lack of stars
based on the amount of stellar fuel there should be 10 times as many
but the reason is because temperatures stop them forming
in some clusters of galaxies temperatures are too high for stars to form
and black holes regulate the temperatures so they never get too cool
