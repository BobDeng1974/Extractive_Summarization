some of us do n't like to hit the bar before midday , but when your drink is poured by a robot bartender you make an exception - even when mine jerks suddenly and i fear a malfunction			2
but , hang on a minute , it 's simply giving my margarita a good shake			2
pouring drinks is only one of these bartenders ' tricks			2
in the evening , they dance to music			1
passengers have rubber wristbands fitted with electronic chips , which can be pressed against various sensors			0
i use mine as a room key , to make payments and to check my itinerary on handy tablets around the ship			1
the 375 interior staterooms also have sea views from virtual balconies — window - sized led screens showing real - time footage shot by exterior cameras			0
this ship is clearly aimed at younger cruisers			0
the indoor @entity55 activity area ( the largest of its kind at sea ) has bumper cars , a roller disco and circus school			0
there 's also an observation capsule ( another first ) , which swoops out over the ship , a @entity25 wave machine for surfing and body ­ boarding , and @entity66 by @entity67 - a vertical wind tunnel for skydiving at sea			1
i 'll have a caipirinha , please : robotic bartenders mix and serve cocktails in the decidedly futuristic @entity30 fairground thrills : adrenaline junkies will also be able to enjoy the bumper cars as part of an amazing variety of entertainment take a seat : the @entity80 on the @entity19 is just one of the entertainment venues on this colossal vessel at the latter , my instructor tells me to thrust out my hips to avoid spinning out of control			1
in my post- ­ skydive photo , the instructor has two arms around my bottom and his face in my chest - and i look as though i 've had a bad facelift			0
the anthem 's 18 restaurants include a hotdog - ­ filled food truck and a @entity100 @entity99 diner			0
for now , @entity19 will remain on this side of the pond , exploring @entity103 from her home port of @entity106			1
in october , she will cross the @entity108 before spending the winter cruising the @entity110			0
which gives the robotic bartender plenty of time to perfect his margarita ­ mixing skills			0
seven nights on @entity19 ( www.royalcaribbean.co.uk , 0844 493 2061 ) , departing @entity106 on june 13 , costs from £ 979pp			1
it will sail to @entity120 and @entity121 in @entity122 , @entity124 's @entity123 , and @entity125 in @entity126 before returning to @entity106 .			1
