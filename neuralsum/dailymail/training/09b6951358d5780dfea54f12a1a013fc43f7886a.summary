by @entity0 published : 16:01 est , 22 september 2012 updated : 16:01 est , 22 september 2012 baking queen : @entity2 has said she buys her filo pastry from @entity5 shops in @entity6 when it comes to baking , it seems there is nothing @entity2 does not know – and can not do			1
yet the doyenne of the @entity14 ’s @entity13 has stunned fans by admitting that there is one challenge so tricky even she refuses to take it on : making filo pastry			1
@entity2 , 77 , who trained at @entity22 school in @entity23 when she was 17 and has published more than 70 cookery books , revealed that filo is the one thing she buys ready - made from shops			1
the paper - thin pastry is notoriously difficult to make from scratch as it needs to be so delicate you can read a page through it			2
@entity2 told @entity34 : ‘ i never make filo pastry because it takes so much effort and i am short of time			1
‘ i think the last time i did make it from scratch was when i was a teenager training at cookery school			0
instead , i buy it for about £ 2 from @entity5 shops in @entity6			1
i then use what i need and keep the rest in the freezer			0
‘ home - made filo takes too much time and skill			1
when i was a teenager at cookery school , i and the other students had so much fun learning to make it			0
we would slap it on the table and bang it about to work the gluten			0
’ @entity2 hinted at purchasing the product on last week ’s show when contestants were tasked with baking strudel			2
while the contestants busily carried out the time - consuming preparation , @entity2 said : ‘ it ’s the one pastry that i have to confess i would buy			1
’ immediately following the admission , users of social network site @entity64 voiced their surprise			0
@entity69 tweeted : ‘ even @entity2 buys strudel pastry rather than making it ? now i feel less guilty about the mess that was my cinnamon layer cake ! ’ sticky subject : great @entity75 bake off contestants were tasked with making their own filo for a strudel and ms @entity79 tweeted : ‘ @entity2 buys her strudel pastry ? * falls off sofa in shock * ’ while @entity83 wrote : ‘ i just love how @entity2 said she does n’t even make her own strudel pastry			1
’ and @entity86 wrote : ‘ @entity2 buys filo ! # vindication			1
’ after hearing about the reaction on @entity64 , @entity2 said : ‘ i ’m sure all the people commenting have got their tongues firmly in their cheek			2
it ’s fantastic that more people are baking at home and if they can use something to cut a corner , then i ’ve not got a problem with that			0
’ @entity2 also told @entity34 why she thinks the @entity14 show – where contestants strive to achieve a ‘ good bake ’ and avoid the dreaded ‘ soggy bottom ’ – has become such a ratings success			2
and she revealed what has made her co-judge , baker @entity107 , an unlikely pin - up			2
‘ the reason the show has done so well is because we are not like other cookery shows such as @entity114 ’s @entity113 , which is full of shouting and swearing , ’ she said			0
‘ @entity107 and i do n’t try to intimidate people on the show – we praise the contestants for their efforts and try to teach them how to improve			0
‘ recently , @entity107 has become a bit of a sex symbol and it ’s not difficult to see why – he is very handsome and he knows what he is talking about			0
i really enjoy working with him			0
’ ratings success : @entity2 , pictured above with her @entity13 co-judge @entity107 , said they try to encourage rather than intimidate contestants on the show			1
