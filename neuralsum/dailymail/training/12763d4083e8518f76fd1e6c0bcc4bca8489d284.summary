by @entity0 last updated at 8:19 am on 6th october 2011 conscience : judge @entity2 , who conducted the @entity3 and @entity4 , says the jailing of @entity6 was political the judge who cleared @entity3 and @entity4 has spoken of how he and the jury reached their verdict by ' following their conscience			1
' in an unusual move judge @entity2 , 68 , gave an interview to a local newspaper in which he explained why @entity6 , 24 , and @entity4 , 27 , were declared not guilty after more than ten hours of deliberations			1
judge @entity2 , who has been a judge for more than 40 years , also added that he felt their was a ' political background ' as to why the @entity19 - who has returned home amid amazing scenes - had been kept in jail			1
speaking to @entity24 at the end of the ten month appeal in @entity27 he said : ' i 'm a little bit tired but i managed to survive and that 's one important thing			2
' i had an optimum jury and a optimum assistant judge ( @entity32 ) and we reached the verdict by following our conscience			2
' this was a difficult case , controversial but we did what was in our conscience			0
' when asked about bitter criticism of the verdict from prosecutors @entity41 and @entity43 , who called it a ' massive mistake ' judge @entity38 replied : ' i do n't know about that			2
' they will read the sentence and they can make their valuations			0
' not guilty : @entity3 reacts as she is set free after four years in jail judge @entity2 will release his ' motivations for sentence ' within three months and this will explain in detail why he and the jury decided to release @entity6 and @entity4 from their 26 and 25 years jail sentences			1
it will be examined closely by the prosecution in @entity27 who have already said they plan to appeal and take the case to the @entity64 in @entity65 and they have 45 days from when judge @entity2 releases his report to file a request			1
any potential hearing would not take place until late next year and @entity6 and @entity4 do not have to attend - the decision will be based solely on documentation from the case to see if procedure was correctly followed			1
judge @entity2 added : ' i went to bed serene , that 's for sure but i did n't sleep very much as i was so tired , it was a late night			1
' then speaking of the booing and jeering that accompanied the verdict by a crowd who had gathered outside the court he said : ' there was too much tension			0
decision : judge @entity2 reads out the verdict , which will be released in full in three months ' there was too much attention on this case and that was because of the excessive media interest			1
that 's why i said what i did ( before retiring ) that it was not a football match and i did n't want cheering			0
' instead well ... too much was made out if it			0
then there is the political background , many wanted @entity3 in prison because she was @entity19			2
' meanwhile it also emerged today that police and prosecutors had no intention of reopening the investigation with prosecutor @entity43 saying : ' there is no question of a fresh investigation because as far as we are concerned @entity112 was murdered by @entity3 ( @entity113 )			0
' @entity114 drifter @entity113 , 24 , was sentenced to 30 years in 2008 after a fast track trial found him guilty of murdering and sexually assaulting @entity112 but this was later reduced to 16 years on appeal			0
however in his sentence report the judge ruled that @entity113 committed the murder ' with others ' and he claimed in a hearing his accomplices were @entity6 and @entity4 although they always denied this			1
home : a tearful @entity3 talks to reporters as her father , @entity6 , right , stands behind her after arriving in @entity129 as a result of the appeal verdict @entity113 himself could now ask for a retrial although and his lawyer @entity134 said it was a possibility he was looking into although if he was again found guilty he could get life			2
@entity112 , from @entity137 , @entity138 , was murdered in 2007 , just two months after she arrived in @entity27 as part of her @entity141 degree			0
her family have been left wondering just who killed her and for months there have been rumours swirling @entity27 that @entity113 was involved in the murder with others			0
during the original trial @entity147 said that fingerprints from other people had been found at the murder scene and never identified .			0

judge @entity2 says the jailing of @entity6 was ' political '
he adds that he is not worried about the decision and that he ' went to bed serene ' afterwards
