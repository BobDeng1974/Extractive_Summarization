a report out of the @entity1 shows rapidly expanding @entity2 is poised to overtake the once invincible @entity3 as the world 's largest economy by the end of 2014			1
the @entity7 looks at exchange rates to reveal purchasing power of different currencies and found that yuan in @entity2 will soon pack more punch than the mighty dollar			1
meanwhile , @entity2 officials bashed the report as flawed , likely for fear of losing its status as a developing nation and the pollution - spewing perks that come with it			1
do n't count on it : the once invincible @entity3 dollar will slip behind @entity2 's yuan in terms of purchasing power by the end of 2014 , according a @entity1 report @entity2 's biggest @entity30 competitor , @entity31 , leaps over @entity32 from its previous tenth place to become the world 's third strongest economy , the report finds			1
the estimate says that , based on 2011 prices , the purchasing power of the yuan was much stronger than was reflected by exchange rates			1
by that measure , @entity2 's economy was 87 percent the size of the @entity3 ' in 2011 , or 15 percent bigger than the previous estimate , according to a calculation by @entity47 economist @entity46			2
faster - growing @entity2 would pass the @entity3 in purchasing power terms this year , though it still would be about 60 percent the size of the @entity3 economy at market exchange rates			1
the @entity1 's @entity7 is conducted every six years and determined that , based on 2011 prices , the purchasing power of the @entity3 yuan will surpass that of the @entity3 dollar in 2014 despite @entity2 's economy being just 60 percent the size of @entity3 's at market exchange rates			1
@entity31 has also leap - frogged over @entity32 to become the world 's third largest economy when measured by purchasing power			1
the current top 10 economies according to the report were as follows : 1			0
@entity66 @entity2 is on track to become the no. 1 economy by sheer size by the early 2020s and possibly sooner			0
but its leaders downplay such comparisons , possibly to avert pressure to take on financial obligations or make concessions on trade or climate change			0
@entity2 's @entity77 , which took part in the study , rejected its conclusion , according to the @entity1 report			2
the statistics bureau ‘ expressed reservations ’ about the study 's methodology and ‘ did not agree to publish the headline results for @entity2 , ’ the report said			2
a figure was estimated anyway by researchers , but ‘ the @entity77 of @entity2 does not endorse these results as official statistics , ’ the report said			2
@entity2 's government has been reluctant to acknowledge previous milestones showing its economic rise when it passed @entity61 as the biggest exporter , @entity32 as the no. 2 economy and the @entity3 as the biggest trader			1
its leaders have emphasized @entity2 's status as a middle - income country in resisting pressure to adopt binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions , for which their country is the biggest source			0
the @entity7 , conducted every six years , is meant to allow comparisons of living standards in countries with widely varying prices			1
the results are a good tool for understanding living conditions for @entity2 families but other uses are limited , said @entity115 , chief @entity30 economist for @entity116			0
‘ it does bring home the sheer size of the @entity2 economy , in the services and goods and that people in @entity2 are producing , ’ @entity115 said			0
‘ where it falls short is that it does n't really tell us about @entity2 's economic standing relative to the rest of the world , ’ he said			2
‘ when it comes to @entity2 's purchasing power abroad , we need to look at the figures adjusted for market exchange rates			1
’ the death knell for 142 years of @entity3 dominance came just as the @entity3 economy slowed drastically in the first three months of the year as a harsh winter exacted a toll on business activity			2
@entity30 's rise : the @entity1 's @entity139 conducts a survey every six years to determine relative living conditions and purchasing power world wide			1
the most recent results indicated @entity2 's imminent rise to the top and show @entity31 has already leap - frogged past @entity32 to become the number 3 world economic power the sharp slowdown , while worse than expected , is likely to be temporary as growth rebounds with warmer weather			1
the economy 's growth slowed to a barely discernible 0.1 percent annual rate in the january - march quarter , the @entity152 said wednesday			0
that was the weakest pace since the end of 2012 and was down from a 2.6 percent growth rate in the october - december quarter			0
consumer spending grew at a 3 percent rate			0
but that gain was dominated by a 4.4 percent rise in spending on services , reflecting higher utility bills			0
spending on goods barely rose			0
also dampening growth were a drop in business investment , a rise in the trade deficit and a fall in housing construction			0
the @entity175 has forecast @entity2 's economic growth this year at 7.5 percent , nearly triple the 2.8 percent outlook for the @entity3			1
with its much larger population of 1.3 billion people , @entity2 barely ranks in the top 100 countries for income per person			0
the report is a reminder that @entity2 consumers only have about one - tenth as much money to spend as @entity3 , said economist @entity187 of @entity188			2
that is about half the world average , on par with the @entity192 , @entity193 or @entity194			0
sellers of consumer goods ‘ may find it discouraging , given it implies a relatively low cost regime for final sales , ’ @entity187 said in an email .			0

a report out of the @entity1 indicates that @entity2 purchasing power will surpass that of @entity3 in 2014
the @entity7 is conducted every six years and accounts for exchange rates as it examines worldwide living standards
@entity2 refused to endorse the findings for fear of losing its *designation* as a developing nation *--* and the *lax* *environmental* standards that come with it
the report shows @entity31 will charge out of 10th place to take @entity32 's number 3 spot
@entity3 's economic dominance has lasted since the 1880s
