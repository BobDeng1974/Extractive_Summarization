by @entity0 last updated at 3:03 pm on 11th october 2011 tv chef @entity1 has sparked outrage after claiming eating puppy meat is no worse than eating a pork chop			1
the @entity6 star , who regards himself as a ‘ real food campaigner ’ , suggested that society has unfairly dictated which animals can be farmed and which can be kept as pets			1
his comments were criticised by animal charities as ‘ wholly unacceptable ’			2
' gimmicky ' ? the tv chef @entity1 - star of @entity6 - admitted he would only eat cats and dogs if he was ' on the point of starvation ' @entity1 told the @entity18 : ‘ in principle , but not in practice , i have no objection to a high - welfare organic puppy farm			1
‘ you ca n’t object , unless you also object to the farming of pigs			1
‘ it ’s an artificial construct of our society , a cultural decision , to make pets out of dogs and meat out of pigs			2
‘ both animals could be used the other way round – although pigs probably do make better meat than dogs and dogs better pets than pigs			2
but it ’s not a foregone conclusion			0
’ however , the 46 - year - old did admit he would only eat loin of labrador or cat liver if ‘ i was on the point of starvation ’			1
last night a @entity50 spokesman said : ‘ we believe that the concept of breeding dogs for food in any conditions , high welfare or not , is wholly unacceptable			0
too cute to eat : the chef said it was an artificial construct of society , a cultural decision , to make pets out of dogs and meat out of pigs ' better meat than dogs ' : @entity1 said you ca n't object to eating dog meat unless you also object to the farming of pigs ‘ dogs are companion animals and as man ’s best friend they provide immeasurable love , comfort and support to owners all over the world			1
‘ they have an innate ability to form real bonds with humans and their loyalty is unquestionable			0
‘ they also contribute so much to society through their vital roles with our armed forces and the police , and they help people in need such as those who are sight and hearing impaired or otherwise disabled			0
’ the full interview is available in the latest edition of the @entity18 an @entity95 spokesman said the chef ’s comments ‘ were made in a crude way ’ , adding : ‘ our concerns are with the farming of any animal , dog or otherwise , and his comments may seem sensible but are actually quite controversial – especially when dogs are our most popular and loved pet			1
’ @entity1 has spent the past five months not eating meat for his latest tv series and for a vegetarian cookbook			0
when asked if his new - found vegetarianism was a gimmick for the £ 1.9million publishing deal , he said : ‘ that money is for a series of eight or nine @entity6 handbooks , which i do n’t write so the money is shared			1
but i do n’t think we ’re gimmicky			0
‘ i started by looking at where food came from , rearing our animals and growing our food			0
’ it is not the first time @entity124 has caused controversy over his food ideas			0
he has eaten curried fruit bat , giraffe and calf testicles in the past			0
in 1998 he fell foul of broadcasting rules when his show tv dinners saw people cooking and eating human placenta			2
he said at the time : ‘ people need to be shocked to make them think about the issues in eating food			2

@entity6 star says people offended by the idea of eating dogs should also object to pig farming
chef admits he would only eat canine if he was ' on the point of starvation '
@entity95 says his comments were made ' in a crude way '
