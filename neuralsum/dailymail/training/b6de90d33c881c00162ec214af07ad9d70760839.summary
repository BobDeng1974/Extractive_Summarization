by @entity1 - potter @entity2 suffers from gout , picture at his home in @entity6 , @entity7 my name is @entity1 and i 've got gout			1
cue much hilarity and jokes at my expense about port and eating too much pheasant			1
through sheer embarrassment i 've been lying about my gout for years , but i 've finally run out of excuses for my never - far - away hobble			1
there are only so many skiing accidents , mountain bike crashes and trodden - on wine glasses any one 43 - year - old can feasibly sustain			1
the normal instinct if you spot someone in obvious pain , unable to endure so much as the weight of a sock on his bulging , hot big toe , is not to double over in amusement			1
that is , unless it 's gout			1
during one of my regular flare - ups , a colleague on a sunday newspaper invariably demanded to look at my grotesque ankle - as glossy and red as an apple , heat coming up off it like an old bar heater			1
just a glimpse rendered her insensible with laughter			1
even alcoholics and drug addicts elicit more sympathy			1
gout sufferers - all 1.5 million of us in the @entity52 alone - receive only mockery			1
this is despite the fact that gout is , say medical experts , the most painful condition known to man			1
it now affects one in 40 adults in the @entity52 , according to a study published last week by the @entity63 , yet it is still widely laughed off as a comedic , self - induced complaint brought on by perceived over-indulgence			2
the latest study found that between 1997 and 2012 the incidence of gout increased by 29.6 per cent			1
although the researchers did not investigate possible causes , rising obesity and alcohol consumption have been blamed			2
and to be sure , alcohol - beer , chiefly - and red meat ( not to mention lentils , broccoli , sashimi and , tragically , @entity78 ) , do aggravate the condition , but they do not necessarily cause it			1
so little is still really known about gout			1
a classically unsexy condition , medical research has been woefully under - funded , lacklustre at best			1
indeed , no one has yet been able even to explain why men - at a ratio of up to ten to one , though the gulf is closing - are so much more prone to it than women			2
this knowledge gap perhaps explains why , as the latest study found , two - thirds of @entity52 gout sufferers have not yet been prescribed preventative drugs			1
i suffered my first paralysing attack at just 21 - i was then a supremely fit , clean - living , 12st vegetarian who regularly cycled 100 miles a day			1
i was trying to walk half - a - mile to the university library one morning with what i assumed was a badly sprained ankle			2
i managed 100 yards before the throbbing pain brought me to an agonising halt : it felt like my right ankle had not only broken in two , but had then been skewered with a rusty blade smeared with some @entity105 toxin			2
i could n't even get my boot off because of the outrageous swelling			2
@entity1 suffered his first paralysing attack at just 21when he was a fit , clean - living , 12st vegetarian hopping did n't work - the movement made the pain even worse - so i started crawling home on my hands and knees			1
at this point , a passing motorist asked if i wanted a lift to the doctor			2
i was swiftly referred to an orthopaedic specialist - a @entity122 consultant who had once treated the tennis player @entity123			2
gout was not mentioned ; no blood tests done			1
he told me i 'd clearly suffered a forgotten sporting injury in my youth and sent me away with a wobble board ( a special board you stand on to strengthen your muscles ) and some insoles for my shoes			1
years passed , with these bizarre attacks getting ever more frequent			2
by my late 20s , i was experiencing fortnight - long flare - ups twice a year			2
sometimes the pain was so excruciating , i could n't leave my flat for days , having to send friends out to buy industrial amounts of ibuprofen ( which i 'd stupidly take at three times the maximum dose ) , plus @entity145 gel , with @entity147 spray on top			2
my father - a pathologist who himself developed gout in his 40s - thought it might be tendonitis , an inflamed tendon			1
i saw another specialist , who suggested surgery - removing a sliver of healthy ankle bone to alleviate supposed pressure from the @entity154			2
that did n't sound sensible to me			2
when an orthopaedic specialist examined him they said @entity1 had clearly suffered a forgotten sporting injury in his youth			1
years passed , with these bizarre attacks getting ever more frequent symptoms , as they do , worsened , but it was not until 2004 that , aged 34 , gout was finally diagnosed			1
i 'd never been fitter - i 'd just done an 18 - month , 15,000 - mile charity cycle ride around the world - but i was still getting attacks that kept me out of the saddle for days at a time			2
i had also developed what a clinic in @entity175 declared ' bursae ' , or bursitis - bulging pockets of crunchy fluid hanging off my elbows like water wings - and ' ganglions ' : bony , marble - sized lumps that studded my knuckles			2
back home , i made an appointment with my new gp , in @entity7 , who immediately suggested gout , a diagnosis swiftly confirmed by a blood test			1
gout - a condition that often runs in families - is caused by the body 's inability to break down and excrete purines , compounds found in certain foods			1
this in turn causes a spike in uric acid , which builds up and forms crystals that gather in a joint , causing inflammation and acute pain			2
my uric acid level , at 0.72 , was way outside the normal range of 0.11 to 0.42			0
i was torn between relief and embarrassed horror			0
but why the shame ? diet is a factor , of course			0
hence all the rich - living jokes			0
certainly , it 's true that @entity187 guidelines advise you to moderate or cut your consumption of purine - rich foods - red meat , liver , kidneys , shellfish - as well as sticking to the maximum alcohol units ( and drinking wine or cider , rather than beer or spirits )			0
symptoms , as they do , worsened , but it was not until 2004 that , aged 34 , gout was finally diagnosed there is no doubt the surest way to bring your uric acid level down is medication			1
upon my belated diagnosis , i was almost immediately prescribed 300mg of @entity242 daily - a uric acid - lowering pill i will probably have to take for the rest of my life			0
my levels were back to normal within a month ; the attacks stopped , briefly			0
the painful bumps on my elbows and knuckles were , however , starting to bother me			0
i finally persuaded an orthopaedic surgeon to remove the ' ganglions ' on my fingers			0
this was done with a local anaesthetic and i will never forget watching the sweat trickling down his brow as he put his knee up on a @entity262 operating table for leverage while he battled to saw through the chalky lumps			0
the proportion of gout patients thought to develop kidney stones they were not , in fact , ganglions			1
nor did i have bursitis in my elbows			0
as a result of my gout remaining undiagnosed and rampant for more than ten years , i 'd developed chronic tophaceous gout ( or tophi ) : clumps of uric acid crystals stuck in my joints			1
i now have scars across my knuckles that would not shame a prize fighter , but at least i no longer look as though i 'm wearing rings under the skin			0
my elbows are still baggy but they are slowly deflating , thanks to medication			0
i still have flare - ups , though			0
i was driving my daughter to school the other morning - my swollen ankle heavily strapped - when i felt an explosion of wet warmth trickling down my right forearm			0
i rolled up my sleeve to see what looked like cottage cheese spurting , with arterial force , from a pea - sized hole in my elbow : the rock - hard urate crystals , excited by the latest flare - up , had burst through the skin			0
aside from medication , @entity1 has embraced lifestyle change i was duly referred to an orthopaedic surgeon - who did n't want to operate - and then to a consultant rheumatologist , who decided drugs were still the answer			0
blood tests showed my uric acid levels had inexplicably crept back up			1
this did seem very unfair			0
aside from medication , i have embraced lifestyle change and any alternative remedy thought to help : cherry extract , a daily spoonful of bicarbonate of soda - said to rid the body of uric acid			0
i even wear a thermal sock on my right foot in bed because uric acid levels rise as your body temperature drops at night			0
my refusal to quit @entity78 notwithstanding , i have forsworn beer , shunned spinach ( less of a sacrifice , admittedly ) and am now - badgered by my doctor - considering giving up playing squash			0
for , as with any arthritic condition , while exercise is beneficial , any activity that aggravates your joints can trigger a gout attack			1
nonetheless , damage has been done			0
uric acid has eaten my ankle away to such an extent that i now also have osteoarthritis			0
so i still have an on - off limp			0
but i am now on a hefty , daily 700 mg of @entity242 - finally , i hope , the correct dosage - which should bring my uric acid down to less than 0.3 , a level at which my body should , within two years , be able to absorb my tophi			0
and at that level there should be no more flare - ups - scarred fingers crossed			0
yet there are potential downsides			0
as my rheumatologist admitted : ' we 'll need to keep a close eye on you			0
these high levels of @entity242 could upset your kidneys			0
' ' by " upset " , do you actually mean damage ? ' i asked her			0
' yes , ' she admitted			0
' at some point , it 's either a new ankle or new kidneys			0
' and - although gout will , i 'm sure , always be a tad comic - that 's not quite so funny , is it ? for further information go to @entity369			1

@entity2 , now 43 , suffered his first paralysing gout attack at 21
was only diagnosed with condition at 34 after blood test confirmed it
