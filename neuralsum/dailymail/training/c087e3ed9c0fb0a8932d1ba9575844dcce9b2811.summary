by @entity0 published : 05:25 est , 12 july 2013 updated : 09:30 est , 12 july 2013 a five - year - old @entity2 boy was filmed being dragged away for throwing a stone at @entity5 soldiers who then blindfolded and handcuffed his father and marched them both in full public view to a police checkpost			1
@entity5 human rights group @entity10 said seven soldiers and an officer detained the boy , named as @entity15 ' @entity14 , in @entity16 for two hours before handing him over to the @entity2 police			1
video of the incident shows @entity20 in floods of tears as he is dragged into an army vehicle before being taken to his home			0
around half an hour later , when the father @entity35 did return , both he and his son were taken to an @entity5 army base where the father was blindfolded and handcuffed			1
mr @entity14 said : ' when i got home , i saw several soldiers standing at the entrance to my house			0
an officer came up to me and ordered me to get my son , @entity44			0
' before i got home , the soldiers had tried to persuade my wife to hand @entity44 over , but she had refused to do it until i came back			0
' the officer told me that he was going to arrest @entity20 and hand him over to the @entity2 coordination			2
arrest : plain clothed @entity5 officers arrest the youngster on a @entity16 street detained : @entity5 soldiers surround the youngster as they wait for a vehicle to arrive ordeal : clearly upset , the boy is led into the vehicle before being driven to his home ' i asked him : " why arrest a five - year - old boy ? " ' a soldier standing next to the officer showed me a stone and claimed that my son had thrown it , and that it had hit the car of a settler who was driving north , near ' @entity72			1
' i tried to persuade the officer not to take @entity15 ' to the @entity73 , but he said that if i did n't bring him , i 'd be arrested			0
[ â€¦ ] i went inside the house and got @entity15 ' , who was hiding there			0
' after handcuffing and blindfolding mr @entity14 , the soldiers walked him together with his son , in full public view , to a police checkpoint , where they were detained for a further thirty minutes			2
at that point , a lieutenant colonel arrived whom the father , who speaks @entity83 , understood to be an @entity5 coordination officer from the @entity73			2
@entity85 : an @entity5 soldier grins at the camera as the boy is detained next to his blindfolded father humiliation : the boy is sat next to his blindfolded and handcuffed father at an @entity5 police checkpost the officer questioned @entity15 ' and asked him why he had thrown stones			1
he also reprimanded the soldiers for arresting the father and son in the presence of video cameras , and complained that ' you 're harming our public image '			2
the officer made it clear to the soldiers that , when detainees are held with cameras around , they must be ' treated nicely			0
at that point the father 's hands were untied , his blindfold removed and he was given a drink of water			0
the soldiers then handed the pair over to the @entity2 police			1
they were taken to a @entity2 police station and briefly questioned before being released			1
superior : an @entity5 officer arrives and remonstrates with his soldiers over their treatment of the father and son while the incident was being filmed the boy 's father @entity35 eventually had his blindfold removed and was given a drink of water @entity10 director @entity128 said detaining a child below the age of criminal responsibility , especially one so young , had no legal justification			2
she said : ' the footage clearly shows that this was not a mistake made by an individual soldier , but rather conduct that , to our alarm , was considered reasonable by all the military personnel involved , including senior officers			0
' it is particularly troubling that none of them apparently thought any part of the incident wad problematic : not the fact that they scared a five - year - old boy out of his wits , nor threatening him and his parents to ' hand him over ' to the @entity2 police , nor threatening to arrest the father on no legal grounds , nor handcuffing and blindfolding the father in front of his son			1
