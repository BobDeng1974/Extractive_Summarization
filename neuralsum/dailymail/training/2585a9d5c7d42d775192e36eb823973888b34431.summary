an extra three million people face being dragged into higher rates of income tax unless the government acts to ease the burden on hard - working families , figures showed yesterday			1
the @entity7 said the ranks of workers paying the 40p ‘ higher ’ rate of income tax and 45p ‘ additional ’ rate will swell dramatically to eight million over the next decade under current plans – meaning around one in four taxpayers are hit			1
the warning about ‘ fiscal drag ’ – where tax thresholds do not rise as fast as inflation or wages – is likely to alarm middle - class voters who are forced to pay 40p in every pound they earn over £ 41,865 to the exchequer			1
the news will pile pressure on @entity28 and @entity29 to outline how they intend to pay for the tax cuts they have promised if the @entity33 win a majority at the general election in may the @entity7 said ‘ politicians may come under pressure to increase thresholds ’ in the coming years given how many people are expected to be drawn into higher rates of tax			1
@entity42 , an analyst at the @entity7 , said : ‘ ten years of fiscal drag creating more higher - rate taxpayers would leave a large fraction of the workforce paying higher - rate tax			2
' it ’s a big increase , and therefore might be politically difficult for a government to go ahead with			0
’ it will pile pressure on @entity28 and @entity29 to outline how they intend to pay for the tax cuts they have promised if the @entity33 win a majority at the general election in may			1
the number of families losing some or all of their child benefit will more than double in the next ten years , the @entity59 it predicted that 1.2million families will have some or all of their child benefit withdrawn next year as austerity bites			0
but that number is expected to rise to 1.8million by 2020 - 21 and 2.5million by 2025 - 26			0
the @entity7 report blamed ‘ fiscal drag ’			0
it said the thresholds at which child benefit starts being withdrawn – one parent earning over £ 50,000 – and is then cut completely – £ 60,000 – are frozen			0
this means more and more families are hit as wages rise			0
the number of earners hit by the 40p tax rate has already soared from 1.7 million in 1990 to 3 million in 2010 and 4.6 million today			2
when combined with those paying the 45p ‘ additional ’ tax rate – which kicks - in on incomes of £ 150,000 a year – 4.9 million are paying more than the basic rate of 20p			1
figures from the @entity7 yesterday showed that this number will soar to 6.3million in 2020 - 21 and 7.9 million in 2025 - 26 – or around a quarter of those in the @entity84 who pay income tax			2
the 40p tax threshold is rising to £ 42,385 from april , and the prime minister and chancellor have pledged to increase it to £ 50,000 by 2020			1
the policy has been opposed by @entity91 and the @entity92			0
the prime minister and chancellor have pledged to raise the 40p income tax threshold to £ 50,000 by 2020 if the @entity33 win the general election			1
that would mean 900,000 fewer workers would be dragged into the higher rate of tax by the end of the decade than if the threshold rose by inflation as currently planned			2
but the @entity102 have so far refused to say exactly where the money will come from to fund such a tax cut amid ongoing austerity			0
the policy has been opposed by @entity91 and the @entity92			0
critics called on all political parties to raise the threshold at which the 40p tax rate kicks in			0
one leading tax advisor said the 40p rate of income tax ‘ was not intended to be a tax on people who you would hardly say are earning a fortune ’			1
the number of earners hit by the 40p tax rate has already soared from 1.7 million in 1990 to 4.6 million today @entity122 , head of public policy at the @entity124 , said : ‘ higher marginal rates reduce incentives to work , so dragging more people into paying the 40p income tax rate would be bad economics			1
‘ even with the implementation of an increased threshold of £ 50,000 , the @entity131 still expects the number of taxpayers paying higher tax rates to increase further to 5.5million people by the end of the next @entity139			1
‘ the government should introduce legislation requiring all income tax thresholds to be increased annually by the higher of wage growth or inflation , to ease the burden on middle earners			2
savings should come from spending restraint , not pernicious tax rises			0
’ the chancellor used last year ’s @entity151 to lift the 40p tax threshold to £ 42,385 from april this year – the first increase in line with inflation since 2010			1
but middle - class families are still being hit by so - called ‘ fiscal drag ’ as they are pulled into the higher rate of tax despite not earning huge sums of money			2
@entity33 mps have urged @entity162 to act to ease the pressure on middle - class voters			0
former cabinet minister @entity165 recently said the threshold for the 40p higher income tax rate would now stand at more than £ 75,000 if it had risen in line with wages			1
the @entity7 said the ‘ politicians may come under pressure to increase thresholds ’ in the coming years given how many people are expected to be drawn into higher rates of tax			0
‘ 10 years of fiscal drag creating more higher - rate taxpayers would leave a large fraction of the workforce paying higher - rate tax , ’ said @entity42 , an analyst at the @entity7			2

experts say workers paying the 40p ‘ higher ’ rate of income tax and 45p ‘ additional ’ rate will swell dramatically to eight million over the next decade
this would mean one in four taxpayers will be hit under current plans
people who earn over £ 41,865 pay 40p in every pound to the exchequer
prime minister and chancellor have pledged to raise the 40p income tax threshold to £ 50,000 by 2020 if the @entity33 win the general election
