@entity13 , 24 , left two children orphaned when she lost control of her @entity3 and careered 8ft through the air before smashing into the huge steel frame on the @entity18			1
her friends , young mum @entity7 , 22 , and aspiring model @entity8 , 24 , who was pregnant , were killed instantly in the crash last august			1
the friends had enjoyed a night out at groove nightclub in @entity22 , @entity23 , when @entity1 decided to drive back to their homes in @entity25 after drinking a strong cocktail			2
@entity28 @entity27 heard that as well as being drunk , @entity1 was speeding and uninsured when she tried to exit the @entity18 at @entity30 at 90mph at 3am on august 13 , last year			1
@entity31 and @entity7 were not wearing seatbelts and were killed on impact			1
@entity1 was pulled alive from the mangled wreckage and suffered fractures to her pelvis , femur , spine and skull			2
@entity1 pleaded guilty to two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and was jailed for 22 months for each count to run concurrently			1
she was also disqualified from driving for five years			1
judge @entity45 told @entity1 , who appeared in court on crutches : ' you only had a full licence for just six months			1
' two months before this you took out insurance which was on a dishonest and fraudulent basis , telling lies about yourself and driving record experience			1
' it was described as a catastrophic error of judgement that you tried to execute that turn			2
' but you were under the influence , travelling very high speeds over some considerable distance which was no error of judgement			2
' fatal accident : after a night out , @entity8 , ( left ) who was pregnant , and @entity7 ( right ) were killed instantly in the horrific smash when @entity1 drove them both home the court heard a back - calculated blood test found @entity1 , from @entity25 , would have had 115mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood - far over the limit of 80mg			1
@entity72 , prosecuting , said : ' as she got to the junction at a speed calculated at 90mph , she was on the verge of passing the slip road exit when at the last moment , she made what can only be described as a catastrophic error of judgement			2
' she decided she was going to make the turn even though she was going far too fast and had far too little time			0
' in attempting to make a turn far too drastic for the speed she was going , the car mounted the ramp , travelled through the air , going at about 8ft above the ground , and smashed directly into a steel gantry			0
' every part of the car was damaged			0
' after the case , @entity7 and @entity31 's mother 's expressed outrage at the ' insultingly low ' sentences			0
@entity94 , who is now caring for @entity7 's 20 - month old son , @entity95 , said : ' i was under the impression a sentence was to both prevent re-offending and act as a deterrent			0
' i feel neither purpose was served by this insultingly low sentence			0
' by handing out only 22 months , the judge is saying @entity7 and @entity31 's lives were only worth 11 months apiece and the baby meant nothing , even though the judge stated that this was not simply an error of judgement			1
' needless to say i was devastated with the outcome			0
' @entity31 's mum @entity113 , who is now looking after three - year - old @entity114 , said she had been looking forward to becoming a grandparent again			0
she added : ' almost 12 months have passed and now justice may seem to have been done , but my pain , my grief goes on for life			2
' for someone to lose just a mere 22 months of their liberty for being the sole person responsible for taking three innocent lives beggars belief and yet they call it justice			1
' but no amount of justice would ever be enough			0
for at the end of the day it does n't change anything			0
' it does not give me my daughter or grandchild back or @entity7 back to her family , and so we must go on , feeling empty , betrayed and forever trying to fill a void that can never be filled			0
' i will always , with every beat of my heart , mourn the loss of my precious daughter , my best friend , my rock and the grandchild i never got to hold or cherish			0
' @entity144 , mitigating , said : ' as far as the woman in the dock in concerned , she expresses remorse , shame and regret			0
