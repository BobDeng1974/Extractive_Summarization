by @entity0 a ' fat gene ’ has been identified , bringing the possibility of an anti-obesity drug a step closer , scientists have revealed			0
the protein , called @entity7 , regulates metabolism and energy expenditure - and researchers found mice deficient in it are 30 per cent slimmer on average			1
the study found the ‘ slim mice ’ weighed less despite eating the same amount and doing as much physical activity as their counterparts			0
scientists have discovered a ' fat gene ' which they say could be responsible for obesity when fed a high - fat diet , mice without @entity7 retained the same weight and fat levels as on normal diets , whereas others given the same food gained almost twice as much weight			1
fat cells in @entity7 - deficient mice were smaller and increased levels of brown fat - which burns up unhealthy white fat - were observed			1
in addition , these mice were better able to process glucose			1
professor @entity39 , of the @entity40 , said : ‘ these mice are thin			0
they lose weight primarily through the loss of fat			0
but they are not runts			0
‘ they are also completely resistant to high - fat diet induced obesity			1
they have much better ability to handle glucose - and seem protected against diabetes			1
’ the researchers said @entity7 interacts with another gene known as @entity54 which for some time has been known to be the most strongly related to being overweight			0
researchers say that mice without the gene do not put on weight when they are fed a high - fat diet scientists say people carrying variants of this gene produce more of @entity7 - revealing a possible cause of obesity			1
professor @entity66 , of @entity67 , said : ‘ @entity7 is probably a master regulator of genetic programmes in the cells where it is expressed			0
‘ we 're interested in what its targets are and what they alter			0
the goal is to identify downstream targets of @entity7 that become models for drug targeting			0
’ researchers showed the connection between @entity7 and @entity54 occurs in humans , mice and zebrafish - suggesting an evolutionary link across different species going back thousands of years			1
the study , published online in @entity87 , implies variants in @entity54 regulate obesity - related traits through links with @entity7 - identifying it as the likely ‘ fat gene ’			2
professor @entity66 said : ‘ our data strongly suggest @entity7 controls body mass and regulates body composition			2
any association between @entity54 and obesity appears due to the influence of @entity7			0
’ tests on mice showed @entity7 interacts with @entity54 even though its locality on the genome is a long way away			2
an analysis of a human genetic database then found the same thing happens in people which was confirmed in experiments on human cells in the lab. using data from 153 brain samples of @entity116 the researchers then discovered the mutations to @entity54 affecting body weight are associated with @entity7 expression			2
obesity - related @entity54 variants enhanced the expression of @entity7 but did not seem to play a direct role in this interaction themselves			2
the scientists believe their discovery could lead to the development of an anti-obesity drug the researchers also discovered mice with altered @entity7 function in the hypothalamus - the portion of the brain known to regulate feeding behaviour and energy expenditure - showed an identical pattern of leanness as those which completely lacked the gene			1
so hypothalamic function of @entity7 seems to control body mass and composition in these animals - indicating the genetic predisposition to obesity is wired in the brain			0
@entity7 codes for a protein that regulates other genes and is present both in and outside the brain , in organs and cells such as fat cells			1
professor @entity66 and colleagues are currently investigating how @entity7 interacts with genes and molecules it regulates and hope to identify targets for the development of drugs against obesity and diabetes .			2

a protein called @entity7 regulates metabolism and energy expenditure
mice deficient in it are 30 *%* slimmer than those who have the protein
they also do not gain weight when fed a high - fat diet
they are better able to process glucose and are protected from diabetes
