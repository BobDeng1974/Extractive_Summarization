by @entity0 published : 04:08 est , 15 june 2012 updated : 12:19 est , 15 june 2012 @entity1 of @entity2 loves her blue @entity4 coat dress so much she wore it to two formal occasions in just a few months			1
but it looked as though fans of her style would not be able to follow suit , because the outfit is from the label 's @entity12 collection and thrifty @entity14 bought it from a discount store			1
now , after the @entity1 proved her admiration for the look , @entity4 has announced it will be re-releasing the tweed coat at a limited number of stores next month			2
the news is sure to delight eager copy - @entity54 , and will no doubt trigger a rapid sell - out showing for the @entity58 designer			2
posh enough ? @entity14 's frayed dress drew comment the last time she wore it for the unfinished edges and high hemline the @entity64 is well - known for its remarkable marketing power			2
when she wore a £ 310 black velvet coat by @entity68 to the wedding of her and @entity72 ’s friends @entity70 and @entity73 in january 2011 , it sold out in hours			1
her famous blue @entity75 engagement dress flew out of @entity50 on the day @entity14 wore it and the £ 16 knock - off at @entity78 sold out within an hour of going online			1
a @entity84 dress she wore to a charity bash sold out in two hours , a @entity80 trenchcoat the wore in @entity82 sold out in a day , and the @entity87 bandage dress she chose to meet the @entity88 last year flew off the shelves			2
the ' @entity90 ' sourced the blue @entity4 coat dress from @entity92 , one of her favourite second - hand stores			0
@entity14 recycled the outfit in @entity34 this week when she attended the @entity97 celebrations			0
@entity1 of @entity2 freshened up the look by pairing the dress with a navy cocktail hat by @entity102 and navy court shoes in place of her usual nude heels			0
she is by now well known for loving the @entity106 and shopping at affordable second - hand stores including @entity108 near her family 's home in @entity112 , which stocks nearly new designer clothes by @entity114 , @entity75 and @entity115			0
@entity14 first wore the blue dress to @entity37 with the @entity117 and @entity118 in march , with grey stilettos and her hair loose			0
the ' recycling ' moment was just the latest example of her thrifty style			0
last weekend , she attended the wedding of prince @entity72 's cousin in an entire outfit made up of pieces she had worn on previous big occasions			0
she chose a £ 795 raw silk @entity133 coat - dress , which she was seen in at last june ’s @entity135 service			1
she teamed it with a £ 99 @entity138 hat with curled trim that she wore to last year ’s @entity140 , and of course , her ever - present £ 180 @entity142 nude heels .			1

it will cost £ 670 and be available at @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity46
