by @entity0 @entity0 , 39 , juggles looking after 1,000 sheep with bringing up her seven children and running a 2,000 acre sheep farm strangely , the job of ' shepherdess ' did n't crop up when i was discussing career options with the teachers at my urban comprehensive			1
nor did ' hill farmer / mother / midwife / tractor driver / cook / cream tea maker / drystone wall builder / all - round dogsbody '			1
so how did a townie like me end up looking after 900 sheep and seven children on one of the most isolated farms in the @entity15 ? i swapped the bright lights for the hills when i was 19 years old			1
my mother had always hoped i might go for a job with @entity20 in my home town of @entity22 or , better still , become the next @entity23 ( i 'm 6ft tall )			1
but , inspired by the @entity15 vet @entity24 , i 'd set my heart on working with farm animals			1
after qualifying as a veterinary nurse i started out as a jobbing farmhand in the @entity29			1
i did n't earn much , but i loved it			1
for the first time in my life i remember thinking , ' i 've got to where i want to be			1
' best of all , my new job introduced me to two of the things i love most in the world : my husband , @entity37 , and @entity38 , the most beautiful place on earth and my home for the past 17 years			1
when i say it 's beautiful , i mean it			2
yes , it 's bleak , it 's remote ( the nearest hospital is more than two hours away , of which more later ) and the wind drives rain into the very fabric of the building			2
when the electricity and water are off we live like the farmers who built the place centuries ago , carrying water from the river and cooking on a fire			2
but it 's the best place to rear children and animals - i ca n't imagine living anywhere else			1
not that i particularly appreciated its beauty the first time i saw it one murky night in october 1996			2
i 'd been asked by a farmer i was working for in @entity69 to drive the 20 miles or so to @entity70 in @entity15 to collect a ram from a friend of his			2
as i pulled up in the farmyard at @entity38 a barking sheepdog emerged from the darkness , followed by a pool of light from the house and a man 's voice			2
' @entity82 an ' lie down , ' shouted the voice			2
i assumed the command was n't for me and , sure enough , the dog slunk away			2
' away in , mi lass , and i 'll get t'kettle on , ' the man said to me			2
@entity0 lives with her husband @entity37 and seven children in @entity15 and that was it			1
there was no great feeling that i 'd met my destiny ; no instant romantic attraction			2
and yet i now know it was the defining moment of my life			2
@entity37 and i got married in the summer of 2000 , four years after we 'd first met			1
i wore a wedding gown in gold shot silk - a white meringue was n't my style , and anyway , it would n't have been practical			2
as it was , i could take the hoop off my dress and feed the calves between the reception and the party			2
nothing stops on a farm - not even for a wedding			1
we did n't go on our honeymoon for a week			0
it was shearing time , and that took priority			0
when the last sheep was clipped we set off for @entity118 , stopping off at bed and breakfasts en route			1
by the time we came home i was pregnant with our first child			0
i 'd hoped to give birth at home - after all , i reasoned , i delivered calves and lambs , how difficult could it be ? i soon found out when i had to be rushed to hospital 60 miles away for an emergency caesarean			0
although we did n't know it then , it was the shape of things to come			0
because it takes an ambulance an hour to get to us , three of our seven children were born in laybys and another at an @entity138 garrison between our farm and the hospital			1
@entity0 was inspired to work on a farm by @entity15 vet , @entity24 it was an unconventional start for them , and i suppose their lives have continued that way			1
i do n't take my children to playgrounds or the swimming baths , but they have a great outdoor life and , i hope , an idyllic upbringing in other ways			1
they eat properly , rarely watch tv and have lots of freedom			0
for a while their favourite activity before the taxi to school arrived was pig riding - seeing how long they could stay on the back of a cavorting pig was , for a little while , a seriously competitive business			0
the @entity167 two , as we called the pigs we had at the time , took it all in good sport and seemed to relish flinging them off into the mud			0
i was relieved , though , when the pigs became part of breakfast itself , instead of a breakfast - time challenge			0
a day out for me is unusual , but sometimes i have to go			0
once , when @entity37 knew i had to have a scan at hospital , he said , ' you would n't tek some sheep to @entity184 's field , would yer ? ' being an idiot , i said yes			1
so there i was , trying to park a long - wheelbase @entity187 with a triple - axle trailer on the back and 45 sheep in it , in a hospital car park			1
i did three circuits , could n't find anywhere to put it , so pulled into an ambulance bay			0
i was sure i 'd get clamped , but clearly everybody who saw it thought there must have been a terrible agricultural emergency			0
why else would anyone park a trailer - load of bleating sheep in a hospital car park ? nobody said it would be an easy life , but i love that we 're filling @entity38 with people			1
we have the children , we have guests staying in our shepherd 's hut and walkers stopping for a break in the sunshine to eat the cream teas i offer in the summer			1
during the shooting season we see parties come up through the farmyards and out on to the moor , a real cross-section of people from beaters to the well - heeled set : @entity223 looking splendid in tweed , and one time even @entity225			0
and then there are the @entity24 tourists - we once had a delightful @entity229 couple intent on seeing a ewe giving birth			0
luckily , one of the ewes showed signs that a lamb was imminent , and out came our visitors ' video cameras			0
then the unusual noises began : agonised groans from the sheep coupled with an eye - popping strained expression			1
i was beginning to feel uncomfortable , but my visitors thought everything was normal and kept filming			0
alerted by the dreadful noise , my husband came rushing in			0
' just keep smilin ' , ' he whispered			0
' i ' ave n't a clue what the problem is			0
' we knelt down and realised two lambs were coming at the same time , jammed like a cork in a bottle			0
' turn t'owd girl around , away from t'camera , ' hissed @entity37			0
' we 're not guaranteed to ' ave a happy ending			0
' but to a round of applause from our visitors , two healthy lambs were born and the couple said it was one of the most amazing things they 'd seen			1
for me , it was just one of the daily miracles in my unpredictable but endlessly rewarding life as a @entity15 shepherdess			0
even after all these years , i find myself catching my breath at the splendour of it all			0
i have a lot to thank @entity24 for			0
the @entity275 by @entity0 ( @entity276 , Â£ 16.99 ) is out now .			1

@entity0 swapped the city for the country when she was 19
she now runs a 2000 acre sheep farm
she is so busy that three of her children were born in laybys
