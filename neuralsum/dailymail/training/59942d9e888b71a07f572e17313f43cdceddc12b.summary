@entity0 insists he did not question the referee @entity2 ’s integrity following @entity4 ’s home defeat by @entity5 on saturday , but has been charged by the @entity6			1
the @entity4 boss insists the post-match comments made were focussing on @entity2 ’s experience rather than his quality , but a statement alleged that @entity0 ’s comments implied that the official ‘ was motivated by bias ’			1
the 65 - year - old claimed @entity2 wanted to ‘ even up ’ the teams by sending off @entity15 shortly after dismissing @entity5 defender @entity16			1
@entity0 also claimed @entity2 had been ‘ influenced ’ by a swarm of @entity5 players during the match			1
@entity0 ( above ) insists his comments did not imply he felt referee @entity2 was motivated by bias @entity0 felt @entity2 ( above ) tried to ' even up ' the sides in sending off @entity24 after @entity16 @entity0 said on thursday before the charge that he was expecting a letter , but did not feel he deserved punishment : ‘ you are bound to get asked questions			1
they have one particular person looking at what we say and do , that ’s their job			0
‘ as long as you do n’t question their integrity , and i do n’t think i did that , i questioned his experience really or the influence of certain things in the game			1
we will have to wait and see			0
i would imagine from what i have been told i will have a letter			0
’ despite @entity0 ’s comments at the weekend , he claimed he has been impressed by the standard of refereeing this season , though admitted he was surprised @entity2 , 35 , was put in charge of his side ’s fixture against @entity5			1
he said : ‘ i have been absolutely delighted ( by the standard of refereeing this season )			0
the referees we have had this season have done really well , it ’s surprised me			0
one or two of the younger ones who have been criticised in the past have done well			0
even on saturday , i think @entity2 will be a very good referee in the future			1
‘ what surprised me a little bit is that a south @entity69 derby like that , when we get a young , quite inexperienced @entity67 referee , even though he ’s a good one			2
people like @entity65 have not got a game			0
it bewilders me if i am honest			0
’ @entity0 says he has generally been impressed by referee standards this season in the @entity67 @entity0 contests one of @entity2 's decisions on saturday with fourth official @entity76 ( right ) @entity0 , meanwhile , has joined the clamour of onlookers criticising the practice of shirt swapping at half - time			1
@entity82 has been ridiculed for swapping shirts with @entity85 ’s @entity84 during @entity87 ’s 3 - 0 defeat against @entity85 on wednesday			1
@entity0 said : ‘ i am not a massive fan ( of shirt swapping )			1
i do n’t think i ’d fine anyone for it			0
there is a time and place for it - probably the tunnel at the end of the game			2
i do n’t see any reason for doing it			0
’ palace travel to @entity100 on saturday and @entity0 does not expect @entity101 ( knee ) or @entity103 ( hip ) to be fit in time			2

he said : ' every game is going to be difficult			0
everyone said what easy fixtures they had at the start and they did n’t pull any trees up			0
i think @entity116 and @entity5 are special but it is more even than it has ever been			2

@entity0 charged by the @entity6 for comments on referee @entity2
@entity2 refereed @entity4 's 2 - 1 defeat to @entity5 and showed two *red* cards
@entity0 *adamant* he questioned @entity2 's experience , not his integrity
