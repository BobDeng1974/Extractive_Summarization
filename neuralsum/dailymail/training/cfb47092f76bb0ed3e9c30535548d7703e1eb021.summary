by @entity0 after last september ’s derby defeat , @entity2 manager @entity1 resorted to boxing metaphors			1
‘ i can take the punches and i am sure there will be more , ’ said @entity1 in the wake of a 4 - 1 loss at the @entity7 that gave the first indication of how difficult his debut season at @entity2 was going to be			1
if he has n’t quite been on the canvas this season then he has certainly leant heavily on the ropes			0
on tuesday night at @entity34 one senses he must drag a match - winning performance from his team if @entity2 and their supporters are to take anything from a wretched season			1
‘ the punches have definitely hurt , ’ said @entity1 on monday when invited to return to the theme			2
rivals : @entity2 could scupper @entity23 's title charge , which would no doubt delight the fans plenty to smile about : but will @entity47 and @entity48 be celebrating on tuesday night ? ‘ they ’ve hurt more because i joined @entity2 with big expectations , that i ’m coming to the winning football club			1
‘ i ’ve got a winning mentality and that ’s what i wanted to do			1
' so i ’m disappointed with myself and i ’m disappointed that we ’ve been unable to win more			0
it ’s not for the want of trying , that ’s for sure			0
’ given that @entity23 are deep into a @entity61 title race , tuesday night ’s meeting is more important to them than it is to a team whose domestic aspirations now amount to little more than a salvation of pride			0
such is @entity2 ’s profile , though , such has been the unending drama of their season , the focus once again seems centred on the defending champions			1
victories over @entity75 and @entity29 — the second more impressive than the first — have leant @entity2 a slightly more settled air , given the trauma of the preceding home defeat by @entity80			2
the trouble with the current @entity2 , however , is that they only ever look one defeat away from fresh disaster and it ’s hard to escape the feeling that if @entity23 arrive with the throttle open they may just burn the house down			2
victors on enemy territory in each of the last two seasons , @entity47 ’s team also have memories of september ’s mauling to buoy them			0
asked if he was surprised how poor @entity2 were , @entity23 midfielder @entity95 said : ‘ yes , of course i was			1
it was the first time i ’d played them after joining @entity23			0
testing times : @entity20 insists even victory in the @entity102 derby can not repair the damage at @entity2 painful : @entity2 's 4 - 1 defeat by @entity80 at @entity34 has perhaps hurt the most ‘ it ’s a club with a lot of history , with very good players , they were the champions — so yes , i was surprised at how badly they played that day and how easily we won			1
‘ the situation is different now because we are fighting for the title and they are not , they are maybe just fighting for honour now			0
it ’s been a bad time for them but i saw their game against @entity75 and they played very well			0
’ @entity47 neatly sidestepped a question about how many @entity2 players would get into his team			2
nevertheless , it was a moot point			0
there does seem to be a widening gap between the teams and @entity2 ’s cause is not helped by a defensive crisis that will only be partially eased by the return of @entity132 and by a clear imbalance between the two midfields			2
more than 20 goals have sprung from the centre of @entity23 ’s midfield this season , for example , while @entity2 can boast only one each for @entity20 and @entity141			1
from downtown : @entity19 lines up an audacious lob from just within @entity29 's half of the pitch reality : wins over @entity75 and @entity29 do n't cover over the cracks of @entity2 's poor campaign @entity47 would only say that ‘ maybe @entity2 are more stronger and we are more technical ’ in that area , while @entity1 did his best to counter suggestions that his team had essentially been blown away in midfield by teams like @entity80 , @entity23 and @entity157 this season			1
whatever the case , @entity2 will have to find a way to stop the marauding @entity162 before they can even think about imposing themselves			1
asked on monday if he had questioned himself this season , @entity1 was candid			1
big loss : @entity165 celebrates scoring in the return fixture earlier this season ‘ i do n’t actually blame myself , ’ he said			2
‘ it would n’t be right to say there are things you would n’t maybe look at in a different way			0
but i ’ve looked back at many things and most of the things we ’ve carried out we would continue to do			0
’ @entity1 ’s self - belief will either encourage or baffle @entity2 fans , depending on their point of view			1
certainly tuesday night he needs to give them something to cling to			0
to return to the boxing theme , @entity2 ’s domestic title belt is already surrendered			2
to land one final punch on tuesday , though , would at least indicate some champion spirit remains			0
fitness doubt : veteran defender @entity132 ( second right ) has been struggling with a back injury seeing red : @entity186 was suspended against @entity187 after being sent off at @entity188			0

@entity1 needs to drag match - winning performance at @entity34
despite *stuttering* season , @entity2 boss says : ' i *'ve* got a winning mentality '
@entity2 must stop the marauding @entity162 is they hope to be victors
@entity1 says he ' does n't blame himself ' for @entity2 's poor start
