by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:40 est , 11 march 2012 updated : 05:58 est , 12 march 2012 centre of breach : @entity4 created a fake @entity6 account for @entity8 's @entity7 , admiral @entity9 in a bid to steal private information from his friends @entity8 's most senior commander has been embroiled in a major security alert after a fake @entity6 account was set up in his name by ‘ @entity18 spies ’			1
senior @entity20 military officers and @entity22 staff are understood to have accepted ‘ friend requests ’ from a bogus account for @entity8 ’s supreme allied commander @entity9			1
in the mistaken belief they had linked up with the @entity28 admiral on the site , they then unwittingly provided a treasure trove of personal details – including pictures , phone numbers and email addresses			1
@entity8 will not officially say who was behind the cyber-fraud or who accepted friend requests but it is understood that evidence points to @entity18 state - sponsored hackers			1
admiral @entity9 – who was in charge of operations in @entity44 to bring about the end of @entity47 ’s regime – now has an official @entity6 page , while the bogus one has been permanently deleted from the internet			2
although spies are unlikely to have found any genuine military secrets , it is not known how much information was harvested and any personal details could be used to create profiles of targets for blackmail or espionage			1
officials at @entity61 , the @entity61 , confirmed the admiral had been targeted			1
a spokesman said : ‘ this type of compromising attempt is called “ social engineering ” and has nothing to do with hacking or espionage			2
‘ discussions / chats / postings on @entity6 are of course only about unclassified topics			0
’ a @entity8 official added : ‘ there have been several fake supreme allied commander pages			0
we are not aware that they are @entity18			0
@entity6 has co-operated in taking them down			0
’ internet con : the genuine @entity6 page of @entity80 , which was imitated by suspected @entity18 spies @entity8 officials asked the networking site to remove the fake page last year			2
@entity6 said false accounts have very different footprints from normal users and are identified using the most sophisticated techniques			0
an @entity22 spokesman said : ‘ we issue guidance on the risks and benefits of channels such as @entity6			1
’ the fake @entity6 account is the latest tactic in the use of the internet to spy on key figures , with an increasing fear that @entity18 intelligence agencies are using ‘ electronic warfare ’ to target not just military secrets but every aspect of western life			0
information allegedly stolen by hackers includes secrets of stealth aircraft , submarine technology , the space programme and solar energy			0
a @entity6 spokesman said : ' we removed the profile for violating our terms within a business day of receiving a report			0
' threat : officials at @entity8 's headquarters in @entity121 ( above ) got @entity6 to remove the bogus account as soon as they were made aware of it late last year			2

@entity20 top brass and @entity22 officials *duped* into accepting ' friend requests '
fears private details could be used to hack *passwords* on classified files
