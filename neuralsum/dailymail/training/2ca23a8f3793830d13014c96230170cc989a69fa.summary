by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 @entity4 mayor @entity3 has condemned a @entity5 ruling against a @entity8 application to block the so - called ' @entity9 ' @entity11 judges have rejected a bid by @entity8 to block a financial transaction tax on the @entity14 which could cost @entity8 £ 25billion - a - year			1
@entity3 condemned the ' barmy ' plan , which he warned would lead the @entity8 at the mercy of interference from @entity18			1
the @entity5 ruled against a @entity8 application to block the tax , claiming it was premature when the detail of the plan has not been agreed at @entity24 level			1
the @entity8 government has not signed up to the controversial tax , which it is feared , could lead to levies on transactions capable of severely affecting deals made in the @entity14			1
a study from the right - wing think tank the @entity30 last year estimated the total cost to the @entity8 economy alone could be as high as £ 25.5billion a year			2
mr @entity3 condemned the ruling to throw of the @entity8 legal challenge , claiming rival financial centres would now be ' licking their lips ' at the prospect of picking up trade from @entity8			1
the @entity4 mayor said : ' this judgment beggars belief			1
with @entity4 ’s economy buoyant once more and driving the national recovery , the last thing that we need is a barmy tax that will stamp on growth and potentially drive businesses to financial centres outside the @entity24			0
' finance is a global game and our rivals in the @entity55 and @entity56 will be licking their lips in sheer delight			0
' this ruling also raises serious questions about how the @entity8 can safeguard its financial services sector , given that we are not in the euro			2
' the government has been right to oppose this all along and i am sure they will continue to fight this nonsense still further			0
' we can not allow jobs , growth and livelihoods to be jeopardised by those in the @entity24 who mistakenly view financial services as an easy target , despite the fact that the industry is crucial to the economic recovery of all its members			0
' concerns have been raised that @entity8 financial institutions engaging in transactions with those in the participating @entity24 member states would be liable to pay the @entity83 , which would then have to be collected by the @entity8 tax authorities			1
the government challenged a decision allowing ' enhanced co-operation ' between the 11 countries , including @entity89 and @entity90 , in favour of setting up the @entity83			0
the @entity5 ruling has sparked fears trade could be lost to other financial centres around the world but the @entity5 ruled that ' the contested decision does no more than authorise the establishment of enhanced co-operation , but does not contain any substantive element on the @entity83 itself ' and ' the elements of a future @entity83 challenged by the @entity8 are in no way constituent elements of the contested decision '			1
the @entity105 said the @entity5 decision allowed the government to mount a fresh challenge when the final proposals for an @entity83 are produced			2
@entity111 leader @entity110 branded the @entity83 a ' deliberate assault on the @entity14 ' a spokesman said : ' the government is determined to continue to ensure that the interests of countries outside of the single currency but inside the single market are properly protected as the euro area continues to integrate , including with any proposal for a @entity83			2
' @entity111 leader @entity110 claimed the @entity83 was a ' deliberate assault on the @entity14 ' adding : ' this @entity83 judgment shows that the @entity8 can not act to protect the @entity8 ’s biggest interest			1
it is impotent and at the mercy of an antagonistic federalist court - the @entity5			0
' it shows @entity128 ’s argument that the @entity129 can negotiate a better deal for @entity8 business from within the @entity24 as a fraud and a farce			0
' the only way to protect the @entity8 financial interest is to withdraw from the tax - hungry @entity24 and stop giving @entity18 power over us			1
' the @entity139 ' senior adviser on @entity11 , @entity140 , said : ' two of the last four legal challenges brought by the @entity8 against @entity24 rules on financial services have now been thrown out			2
' while there is still some hope for a future challenge when the @entity83 is put into place , there is a real risk that the financial industry 's support for @entity24 membership may be eroded as a result			0
' but @entity156 general secretary @entity155 said : ' the chancellor should never have taken this case and used taxpayers ’ money to defend @entity14 fat cats			0
' it ’s time the financial sector paid its fair share of the costs of the economic crisis they helped cause			0

@entity5 throws out @entity8 bid to block ' @entity9 tax '
judges rule legal bid was premature as detailed plans not yet agreed
