safe haven : members of an @entity40 ngo hold up placards reading ' @entity82 ' outside the @entity83 during a demonstration in support of the @entity72 's asylum request speaking to the @entity88 from the @entity40 embassy in @entity12 , where he suddenly arrived seeking a last - ditch bid for political asylum last tuesday , he said : ' ultimately it may be a matter of what guarantees the @entity34 , the @entity68 and @entity17 are willing to provide '			1
mr @entity3 believes @entity96 will pursue him after @entity4 published a cache of sensitive documents , including about the @entity100 and @entity101 wars , and thousands of diplomatic cables which have embarrassed governments worldwide			1
he said : ' for example , if the @entity68 were to guarantee ( it would ) drop the grand jury investigation and any further investigation of @entity4 publishing activity , that would be an important guarantee ... diplomatic commitments do have some weight			2
' mr @entity3 has been holed up in the @entity40 embassy to avoid extradition to @entity17 following the failure of a bid to re-open an appeal against his removal from the country			1
mr @entity3 is friendly with the @entity121 country 's socialist leader @entity119 and embassies are regarded as ' safe havens ' which @entity34 police can not enter			2
veteran journalist @entity125 last week said the @entity40 were being very hospitable and had provided mr @entity3 with a ' fairly big room with a computer ' although he would not confirm whether he had been given a bed for his stay			2

@entity147 , director of just foreign policy - an @entity121 organisation dedicated to reforming @entity68 foreign policy - gave the @entity40 consul @entity151 on the steps of the @entity154 embassy just after 4.30pm			2
mr @entity147 said those who had signed the letter , including radical academic @entity157 and actor @entity158 , were concerned about mr @entity3 ’s fate if his application is rejected			1
' our concern is that if @entity3 is sent to @entity17 that the government of @entity17 maybe send him to the @entity68 where he may be prosecuted under the @entity162 ' mr @entity147 said			2
' many people in the @entity68 are very concerned about this , are very concerned about @entity3 and the @entity68 campaign and hopefully president @entity119 can give him a positive decision in this case '			0
discussion : the @entity40 ambassador @entity171 , left , has now gone back to @entity40 to discuss mr @entity3 's claim for political asylum			1
he has criticised @entity72 pm @entity174 , right , over the handling of his case accepting the documents , mr @entity151 said ' mr @entity3 is under the protection of the @entity40 state , as you know			1
' ( the letter ) will be sent to president @entity119 ... we will make sure he get ’s it			0

speaking after visiting @entity3 today , mr @entity147 said mr @entity3 was in ' good spirits ' despite living in ' modest ' surroundings			2
' my sense is that @entity3 is used to simple living , ' said mr @entity147			0
' i 'd say he is living now as i did when i was an undergraduate in college - in what looked to me like a study that 's been converted into a makeshift bedroom that 's still functioning as a study and workspace			0
' asked whether @entity3 was sleeping on an inflatable mattress , mr @entity147 said : ' i wo n't deny that it 's an inflatable bed			0
' @entity4 spokesman @entity205 , who also visited mr @entity3 today , said ' little had changed ' regarding the asylum application			1
mr @entity205 said : ' the @entity40 government has requested material both from @entity3 and from authorities in @entity17 , the @entity34 and @entity68 before they make a formal decision			1
' mr @entity205 said reports that the @entity17 government had ruled out guaranteeing mr @entity3 wo n't be extradited to the @entity68 were of ' grave concern '			1
@entity3 's bid to avoid extradition has left his celebrity backers , including socialist @entity217 , facing an embarrassing £ 240,000 financial headache ' i do n't have understanding whether this is the official position of the @entity17 government , but it 's of grave concern , ' he added			0
however , he said mr @entity3 was in ' good spirits ' and keeping busy , adding : ' he 's working , doing what we are supposed to be doing , @entity4			2
' meanwhile , mr @entity3 , who wants to start a new life in the @entity121 country , has again criticised @entity72 prime minister @entity174 over @entity228 's handling of his case			2
the former computer hacker said his situation was ' a serious political matter ... ( that ) the @entity72 government should treat with the seriousness it requires '			0
he said : ' i have been attacked by the @entity68 , from the vice president down , as a high - tech terrorist , and by the @entity17 prime minister and foreign minister -- surely that requires some direct response from the @entity174 government			0
' mr @entity3 has said he chose @entity40 's embassy instead of his home country 's because he felt @entity228 had done nothing to protect him , a charge the government has denied			1
@entity228 has said it has limited capacity to help him because he is not in @entity72 and has not broken any @entity72 laws			0
@entity72 has also dismissed the idea that @entity96 is keen to get mr @entity3 , with foreign minister @entity250 saying sunday there was ' no hint ' of a plan to extradite him to the @entity68 last week , @entity40 's president said the @entity121 nation would have to consider ' whether @entity3 's life is at stake ' , as it makes it decision on asylum			1
president @entity119 told @entity260 the country ' defends the right to live '			0
president @entity119 also said : ' we are analysing @entity3 's asylum request in a very serious and responsible way			0
we ca n't give an official response until the analysis of his request is complete			0
' mr @entity3 requested political asylum under the @entity270 , ironic given @entity40 's poor record on human rights and free speech			1
he is set to be extradited to @entity17 , where he faces accusations of raping a woman and sexually molesting and coercing another in @entity74 in august 2010 while on a visit to give a lecture			0
mr @entity3 says the sex was consensual and the allegations against him are politically motivated			2
meanwhile , his bid to avoid extradition has left his celebrity backers , including socialist @entity217 , facing an embarrassing £ 240,000 financial headache after they stumped up the cash to keep him out of jail			0
asked on @entity287 whether she was ' on the hook ' for his breach of bail , she replied : ' yes			0
i had expected him to face the allegations			0
i am as surprised as anyone by this			0
' @entity295 , film - makers @entity142 and @entity297 , and journalists @entity125 and @entity299 were among those who offered to support mr @entity3 's bail while he fought a legal battle to avoid being sent to @entity17			1
those who did stand surety for mr @entity3 – freed on bail in december 2010 after spending nine days in @entity306 jail when held under a @entity308 arrest warrant issued by the @entity17 – risked losing their money the minute he walked into the embassy , just yards from @entity311			1

@entity4 founder said he would ignore note as ' asylum law takes precedence over extradition law '
the @entity72 is told to be at @entity26 police station *tomorrow* morning
mr @entity3 wants diplomatic *assurances* he will not be extradited to the @entity68 where he could face espionage and conspiracy charges
if he goes to @entity17 to be questioned over sex assault allegations he fears they will turn him over to @entity68
