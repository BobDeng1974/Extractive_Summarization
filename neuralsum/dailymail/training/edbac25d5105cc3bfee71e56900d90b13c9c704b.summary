by @entity0 every living thing on @entity2 depends on a mysterious tangle of molecules called ribosomes			1
these are the cell ’s protein factories , translating the genetic information in @entity9 into an amino acid sequence to create proteins			1
scientists believe that the ribosome - whose history is difficult to track - holds clues to how the first molecules of life came together around four billion years ago			1
the researchers found distinct fingerprints in the ribosomes where new structures were added to its surface now researchers are a step closer to uncovering these clues after modelling the evolution of these biological factories in unprecedented detail			1
ribosomes are the biological superstructures that translate genetic information into proteins			1
these small biosynthetic factories convert the @entity9 genetic information into an amino acid sequence – which is the primary structure of proteins that make up our body			1
in each living cell , the information contained in the nucleus of a cell is ' transferred ' to a messenger @entity58 ( @entity57 )			1
the @entity57 leaves the nucleus and travels to something known as the endoplasmic reticulum where two ribosome subunits assemble around it and start synthesising proteins			2
hundreds of thousands of ribosomes work in each living cell			2
for example , quickly replicating cells , such as liver cells , may contain a few million ribosomes			0
even bacterial cells may contain up to 100,000 ribosomes			0
the core of the ribosome is essentially the same in all living systems , while the outer regions expand and become complicated as species gain complexity			0
by digitally peeling back the layers of modern ribosomes , scientists at @entity80 in @entity81 were able to model the structures of the very first of these biological factories			1
' the history of the ribosome tells us about the origin of life , ' said @entity91 , a professor in the @entity92 at the @entity80			2
' we have worked out on a fine level of detail how the ribosome originated and evolved			0
' humans have the largest and most complex ribosomes			0
' but the changes are on the surface – researchers found the heart of a human ribosome is the same as in a mould ribosome			1

ribosomes are the biological superstructures that translate genetic information into @entity112 small biosynthetic factories convert the @entity9 genetic information into an amino acid sequence – which is the primary structure of proteins that make up our body ' the translation system is the operating system of life , ' professor @entity91 said			1
' at its core the ribosome is the same everywhere			0
the ribosome is universal biology			0
' the study compared three - dimensional structures of ribosomes from a variety of species of varying biological complexity , including humans , yeast , bacteria and archaea			2
the researchers found distinct fingerprints in the ribosomes where new structures were added to the ribosomal surface without altering the core			2
the research team worked the process backwards in time to generate models of simple , primordial ribosomes			0
' we learned some of the rules of the ribosome , that evolution can change the ribosome as long as it does not mess with its core , ' professor @entity91 said			1
' @entity153 can add things on , but it ca n’t change what was already there			1
' hundreds of thousands of ribosomes work in each living cell			2
for example , quickly replicating cells , such as liver cells , may contain a few million ribosomes			0
even bacterial cells may contain up to 100,000 ribosomes			0
@entity165 ( pictured ) can be found in different parts of a cell			0

ribosomes contain *secrets* on how first molecules of life came together
they are a cell ’s factories , translating genetic information into proteins
scientists in @entity81 digitally peeled back layers of modern ribosomes
study found heart of a human ribosome is same as in a mould ribosome
it concluded that evolution can add things to the ribosome , but it ca n’t change what was already there
