by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:11 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 05:32 est , 8 january 2013 work and pensions secretary @entity2 , pictured arriving at @entity3 yesterday , said coalition reforms mean future generations would only need the state pension the next generation of pensioners should not need to receive extra benefits like free tv licences and help with heating bills , @entity2 suggested today			1
the @entity2 left the door open to removing universal benefits in return for a single - tier pension and encouraging extra saving			1
he repeatedly insisted @entity18 ’s pledge to protect state help for all pensioners was only until 2015 , and vowed to ‘ detach ’ older people from means - tested help			2
mr @entity18 told pensioners before the last election that the @entity25 , bus pass , @entity27 and free tv licence were all ‘ safe ’			1
‘ you can read my lips , that is a promise from my heart , ’ he added			0
mr @entity2 insisted the commitment was ‘ fair and reasonable ’ because pensioners are less able to increase their income than someone in work and could then ‘ plan for those five years '			2
‘ the problem with pensioners is they have less flexibility , they find it much less easy to make provision to change if things are changed for them , ’ he told @entity40 ’s today programme			0
‘ so you need to take more time and take longer over changes to pensioners			0
’ but he suggested that beyond 2015 new pensioners might not enjoy the same perks			0
‘ there ’s a cohesive message which says for the most vulnerable people as possible we will try to protect them and for the next generation coming through to ensure that they make the kind of savings and provision that allow themselves to be taken above any extra dependence on the state whilst they receive a decent basic state pension			1
’ @entity70 and @entity18 launched the coalition 's @entity71 with a pledge to link rises in the state pension age with life expectancy @entity70 leader @entity70 has demanded the universal benefits for pensioners be reconsidered before 2015			1
but mr @entity2 said : ‘ if there are going to be any changes made as a proposal those are the sort of changes that have to go into a manifesto			2
but you would have to be talking about those in advance			0
we do n’t make plans for the next government at this stage			0
’ aides said he was not speculating about the next manifesto			0
' what we are trying to do is detach pensioners from the position of being dependent on a means test which actually damages savings so we are restoring the savings culture			0
' but these things take time because there is basically a lifetime in work to provide for the time you are on pensions			0
' i think its fairness to pensioners to give them time to make sure you support their income but at the same time reform the way they save			2
the last government damaged the savings culture so we had the worst savings culture on record			0
' a spokesman for mr @entity2 said later : ' @entity2 made it very clear this morning that we have protected all the pensioner benefits for the whole of this parliament and there are absolutely no plans to change that			2
' ministers are expected to set out details of an improved state pension ' that rewards saving ' , with a new flat rate expected to be up to £ 155 - a - week			1
the coalition 's @entity71 , published yesterday , also committed to linking the state pension age with average life expectancy			1
campaigners warn it will mean making people work into their 70s			0
' we will put in place a new mechanism to ensure that the state pension age reflects future changes in life expectancy so that the state pension system continues to be sustainable and affordable , ' the review said			1
the @entity148 said people in the @entity150 could have to work until they are 70 and beyond before receiving a state pension			1
and @entity152 , general secretary of the @entity153 , said : ' despite the warm words in the mid-term review , the coalition 's plans to reform the state pension system will end up making people work longer but contains no pledge to give a higher state pension to existing and future pensioners			1

@entity2 insists *handouts* like *winter* fuel *allowance* and tv licence are safe for *current* pensioners
but ' next generation ' will be encouraged to save to remove ' any extra dependence on the state '
coalition plans single - tier pension of around £ 155 - a - week
linking state pension age to life expectancy ' will mean working until 70 '
