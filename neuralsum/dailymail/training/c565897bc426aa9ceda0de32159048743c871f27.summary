forget spreadsheets , diaries and time stamps , a design studio in @entity4 has created the ultimate work planner made entirely of @entity6 that syncs with online calendars - meaning it is always up to date			1
created by @entity9 , the @entity6 calendar is mounted to the studio wall in @entity4 and staff members are each assigned their own mini figure			1
each row of flat @entity6 represents a month , with time slots and tasks determined by different coloured and sized @entity6 bricks			1
when a photo is taken of the calendar , specially - designed software scans the image , identifies the various parts and syncs the data with an online , @entity27 version			1
each row on the @entity6 calendar , pictured , represents a month and every column is a day of the week			1
staff members each have their own mini figures			1
a work project is given its own colour , and a paper colour index is created for each staff			0
each @entity6 brick then represents a half day spent on a particular project each row represents a month - the @entity9 team have three on the wall of their studio			1
every column represents a day of the week and each staff member has their own row			1
a work project is given its own colour and an index is created so that everyone knows which colour represents which project			0
each @entity6 brick then represents a half day spent on a particular project			1
@entity52 has additionally created software that scans the image , searching for the position and colour of every brick			1
it then syncs with a cloud version of the calendar - vitamins design uses @entity27 - and the information is synced and automatically updated across devices of anyone who has subscribed to it			1
the software has been designed to work with any phone			0
@entity9 said : ' one thing we always talk about in the studio is how to organise ourselves - it ’s something we always think we can improve			0
' so we started looking at all the different ways people organise things ; from post-it notes on computer screens , diaries , to - do lists and some really complex project planning software			0
' [ the @entity6 calendar ] makes the most of the tangibility of physical objects , and the ubiquity of digital platforms , and it also puts a smile on our faces when we use it ! ' the calendar has also been designed to be secure			2
@entity9 added : ' we needed something we could put up on the wall without revealing our client names , or project information to casual passers by '			0
the team has three months visible at any one time on the wall of their studio			2
every column represents a day of the week and each staff member has their own row			2
a work project is given its own colour , and an index is created so that everyone knows which colour represents which project			0
every time a user changes something on the calendar , they take a photo of it with any smartphone , pictured			2
the photo is emailed to a special address , scanned for different colours and sizes , and a reply is sent letting the user know the information on the @entity6 calendar has been synchronised each @entity6 brick then represents a half day spent on a particular project			1
@entity52 has written software that scans the image , searching for the position and colour of every brick			2
staff members are assigned mini figures , pictured , and the @entity6 bricks are lined up along the row that corresponds with that employee it then syncs with a cloud version of the calendar and the information is automatically updated across devices of anyone who has subscribed to it			1
the software has also been designed to work with any phone			0
' every time you change something on the calendar , all you need to do it take a photo of it with any smartphone , ' said @entity9			2
' then , you just email the photo to a special address we created			0
a couple of seconds later you ’ll receive an email letting you know that all of the information on the @entity6 calendar has been synchronised to your digital calendar			2
' we use @entity27 at the moment , but this would work with any cloud based calendar			0
' the design studio has been using the calendar for around a year and the team joke that staff members sometimes hide emergency blocks of ' time ' , and have started using double height bricks to represent deadlines and important meetings			1
' its power is in its the immediacy and tangibility			0
rather than recording minute details about what to do each day , it shows you an immediate overview of how your time is allocated spent in relation to the rest of the studio			0
' it sounds crazy , but this way you actually notice when something has changed , and you need to physically find a place to put the bricks you have removed - rather than a digital square quietly vanishing in the background on your computer screen			0
' the team plan to upload the computer code online so other people can start using it .			0
