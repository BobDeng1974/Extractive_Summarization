teenagers are often seen trying to study while listening to music , watching tv and juggling texts and tweets			0
but new research by two final year school girls , overseen by @entity7 , found that 85 per cent of young people struggle to perform simple tasks when distracted by music , phones or email			1
for a fortunate 15 per cent of so - called ' high media multitaskers ' , performance actually improves when there is outside stimuli			1
@entity26 , 17 , one of the study 's authors , said : ' we really wanted to see how media multitasking is affecting young people			2
' media multitasking is a huge part of young people 's lives			2
so we may be able to cope with switching between tasks better ... but most people still work at their best while focusing on one thing			0
' the researchers used a series of cognitive tests to measure how distractions affected the ability to complete simple tasks			0
they were then classified as high , medium or low media multitaskers , using a standardised test developed by researchers at @entity7			1
those rated at the high level reported spending an average of three hours a day multitasking , including at least 50 % of the time they were doing homework			0
students at the low level spent 20 minutes a day multitasking on average , and barely at all while doing homework			0
of the 403 total participants , 60 were classified in the high group , 50 in the low group and the rest were moderate media multitaskers			2
@entity65 , 18 , who worked on the project said : ' but this one group of people — the high media multitaskers — performed best when they are in a multitasking environment			1
the high media multitaskers actually excelled in the multitasking room			1
' maybe we see high media multitaskers excelling in this area because they 've grown up with technology their entire lives ... the results mean students should focus on what kind of learner they are , so they know how to work best			1
' the students , who say they are n't heavy multitaskers themselves , conducted the study as part of the @entity86 's science - research program			2
' my friends laugh at me because i have to sit in a totally silent room to concentrate , ' said ms @entity65			0
previous research has suggested that the use of multiple digital devices simultaneously can change the structure of the brain			0
academics at @entity96 , published in the online journal @entity98 , found high media multitaskers had a lower grey - matter density in a part of the brain that determines how we think and feel			1
other studies have suggested that genetics could play a part in ability to multitask .			0

young people struggle with simple tasks when distracted , study finds
research *undertaken* by two teenagers and overseen by @entity7
just 15 per cent *dubbed* ' high media multitaskers ' improved with stimuli
more than 400 students , with an average age of 14 - and - a - half , were analysed
