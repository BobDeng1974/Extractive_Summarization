the @entity1 administration is in full damage - control mode after the @entity3 was forced to admit wednesday that fewer than 27,000 signed up for @entity5 health plans through the disastrous healthcare.gov as of nov. 2			1
the federal government 's horrible numbers come out to 744 people per state			0
thirty - six states are relying on healthcare.gov to process all their enrollments			2
fourteen states plus the @entity14 have their own and better run healthcare exchanges			1
enrollments in these brought the total signing up to 106,185			0
that number represents just 1.5 per cent of the 7 million the @entity5 system will need to attract by the end of march in order to take in enough money to pay for its expected financial outlays in 2014			1
during his daily briefing on wednesday , @entity25 press secretary @entity24 deflected questions seven separate times about the administration 's expectations for enrollments by the end of november			2
they are averaging 5,267 sign - ups each			1
making matters worse , doubts still remain about what those numbers mean , since @entity3 included @entity52 who have chosen insurance plans and put them in virtual ' shopping carts , ' but not yet paid for them			1
in early september the @entity1 administration projected that 494,620 people would sign up during october			1
@entity3 secretary @entity35 told reporters on a conference call that her system is gathering steam despite the poor showing			0
' even with the issues we ’ve had , the marketplace is working and people are enrolling , ' she insisted			0
' there is no doubt the level of interest is strong			0
' the administration said wednesday that a total of 975,407 people ' have made it through the process by applying and receiving an eligibility determination , but have not yet selected a plan			0
' that number includes hundreds of thousands who will receive government subsidies			0
last laugh : conservatives have been calling for @entity5 's repeal for three years , and will feel vindicated now that the system 's results are nowhere near what the @entity25 and its health agencies have promised @entity89 chairman rep. @entity88 has proposed a rollback of @entity5 fines and requirements for anyone who has their own individual health insurance plans as of december 31 @entity35 said last week in a @entity97 hearing that @entity3 expects 1 million to enroll by year 's end			1
but @entity100 chairman @entity99 , a @entity102 @entity101 , suggested in a statement that the @entity5 system has little hope of recouping its losses			1
' even if this data was an accurate picture , the administration would need to enroll 68,000 people per day to meet their year - end goal , ' he said ' however , the website is n’t even designed to handle that much traffic and is currently capable of only handling less than half that much			0
' senate minority leader @entity115 complained that ' only in @entity14 could placing an item in a virtual shopping cart – without even buying it – count as a sale ' ' if private businesses used that standard , online retailers would be poised to announce their best earnings season in @entity52 history , ' he mocked			1
most of the people who have enrolled in plans chose free @entity129 coverage or plans available through the @entity131			1
those options will cost taxpayers billions without putting any new money into the system through monthly insurance premiums			2
nearly one - third of the nationwide enrollment numbers came from @entity138			2
success stories in @entity140 and @entity141 , which are part of the healthcare.gov portal , were just 3,571 and 2,991 , respectively			0
lame , wounded duck ? presdient @entity1 promised that @entity52 who liked their health plans could keep them , but more than 4 million have received cancellation letters because of his signature insurance overhaul law unimpressed : @entity100 chairman @entity99 said @entity3 still needs to enroll 68,000 people every day through december 31 to reach its year - end goal those three states have been a key part of the administration 's strategy from the beginning , since they are home to a large plurality of the nation 's uninsured , a group that the @entity25 sayd numbers more than 50 million			1
whistling past the graveyard ? @entity35 said last week that she still expects 1 million @entity52 to sign up for @entity5 coverage by dec. 31 the @entity25 as strained to keep expectations low in recent weeks , following a chronically ill launch of the @entity5 's main website			2
@entity168 analyst @entity167 called the healthcare.gov episode ' a complete disaster for the administration ' on wednesday			0
' it 's clear that they 've been low - balling what to expect , and i 'm not quite sure they low - balled it enough			0
' @entity3 has promised that the site would be fully fixed and functional by the end of november , but a report in the @entity181 today but the @entity25 has only assured reporters that it will work for a ' vast majority ' of @entity52			0
@entity184 , a conservative group that has long opposed @entity5 and mocked its rollout , said in a statement that the @entity25 is shading the truth , even with its lower than expected numbers			2
' in the real economy , a business does n't count sales until they 've actually been paid , ' said the group 's president , @entity192			0
' the @entity1 administration however , is counting 106,185 @entity52 as having enrolled , regardless of whether they 've actually purchased a product or not			1
' more than 4 million @entity52 have lost their health insurance in recent months as a result of @entity5 's new requirements covering private insurance			2
president @entity1 is under intense pressure to keep his oft - made promise that taxpayers who are happy with their existing medical insurance policies would be able to keep them			1
former president @entity204 said this week that he thought the law should be tweaked to allow the government to keep its pledge .			0

*abysmal* numbers will add new pressure as @entity101 press for changes to the @entity5
106,185 chose plans overall , including the separate websites run by 14 states and the @entity14
nearly one - third of all sign - ups came from @entity138 , which is running its own exchange site
the @entity1 administration is drawing heat for including in its numbers anyone who put an insurance plan in their online shopping cart , even if they have n't paid for the policies
far more – *396,261* – have chosen to enter the @entity129 system , which will put a drain on *resources* instead of adding new money to the system
