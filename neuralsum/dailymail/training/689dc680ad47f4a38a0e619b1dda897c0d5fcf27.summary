by @entity0 published : 20:47 est , 29 november 2013 updated : 20:48 est , 29 november 2013 @entity3 girls are the second most likely to get drunk in the developed world , a report has found			1
only in @entity5 are 15 - year - old girls more likely to say they have been drunk at least twice in their lives			2
the @entity3 is one of only seven of the globe ’s industrialised nations where drinking among girls is a larger problem than among boys – leading to fears of a dangerous ladette culture taking over			1
binge problem : @entity3 's position in the survey puts it below countries traditionally seen as having alcohol problems , such as @entity22 some 44 per cent of @entity3 15 - year - old girls told researchers they had been drunk at least twice , compared to 39 per cent of boys			1
@entity3 is sixth in the world league table for boys			2
last night health experts said the shocking figures were a ‘ siren call ’ to ministers , and warned the @entity32 will have to cope with an avalanche of liver disease among young women – with some dying in their 20s			0
@entity3 ’s shameful placing is far higher than countries such as @entity22 which are traditionally seen as having problems with alcohol			1
and @entity41 and @entity42 , which have a more responsible ‘ @entity44 ’ attitude to drinking , are also much lower in the teen drinking league			1
female teenage drinking in @entity41 is less than half the level of that in the @entity3 – even though @entity41 children are often given wine with meals at a young age			1
the shocking findings , by the @entity54 , show that bottom of the list is the @entity57 , where there is a much greater stigma against teenage drinking			1
professor sir @entity61 , special adviser on alcohol to the @entity63 , said the culture in @entity3 had changed , so that being drunk was now seen as ‘ socially acceptable ’ , while children are not protected from advertising which glamorises drinking			1
he said : ‘ we are now seeing more and more young women – in their 30s and even in their 20s – with end - stage liver disease			0
teenage girl drinking graphic ‘ this is n’t necessarily about alcoholics either ; this is young women who started early and got into the habit of drinking in large amounts			0
‘ this government has been very laissez - faire about regulation and this is the result – we are in a very bad place about alcohol			0
’ latest @entity32 figures show around 17,000 people were admitted to hospital with liver disease in 2011/12 , with a doubling in admissions among those under 30 in the past decade			0
@entity91 , chief executive of the think - tank @entity92 , said : ‘ it used to be that women and girls in this country would be ashamed of being drunk , but now this ladette culture has taken hold			2
we have ended up with a situation where young girls are really concerned about seeming cool – yet they do n’t care about being seen vomiting in public			0
’ she said the shocking findings were a ‘ siren call ’ to ministers , demonstrating the urgent need to tackle the drinking culture by reducing access to alcohol , with tighter licensing and regulation of advertising			0
she also warned that girls ’ drinking culture is putting them at risk of sexual exploitation			2
the figures are contained in the @entity54 ’s @entity119 for 2013 , and based on the most recent worldwide survey , which took place in 2010			2
among girls , the @entity3 is second and equal with @entity123 on 44 per cent of 15 - year - olds saying they had been drunk twice before – behind @entity5 on 56 per cent			1
just behind us are @entity126 countries such as @entity127 , the @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130			0
@entity22 stands at 19 per cent			0
@entity3 is far ahead of other @entity132 countries such as @entity133 ( 35 per cent ) , @entity134 ( 28 per cent ) and the @entity57 , on just 13 per cent			1
most continental countries fare far better , including @entity42 ( 14 per cent ) , @entity41 ( 17 per cent ) , @entity136 ( 18 per cent ) and @entity137 ( 19 per cent ) – although @entity138 is 36 per cent			0
the @entity54 average is 28 per cent			1
@entity140 , chief executive of @entity141 , said : ‘ if we want to help young people to make healthier choices we need to cut out irresponsible alcohol advertising and for the government to introduce a minimum unit price , a targeted measure designed to protect the young , which we know saves lives and cuts crime			0
’ @entity151 of @entity152 said : ‘ all the evidence points to the fact that the younger people are when they get drunk , the more likely they will be exposed to serious health risks in later life			0
