drivers who want to travel through the centre of @entity7 , @entity8 , will need to reconsider their route from monday			1
the huge diversion , which has been put in place by @entity12 so 740 yards of road can be resurfaced , is scheduled to last for eight working days			1
the staggering 47 - mile detour was today labelled @entity16 's longest diversion			0
diversion : the short stretch of road in @entity7 , @entity8 , that is due to be closed for roadworks no access : a diversion that takes motorists on a 47 - mile detour to avoid roadworks in @entity7 , @entity8 , just a few hundred yards long was today branded ' laughable ' round robin : drivers who want to travel through @entity7 will be directed on the huge detour from monday it has left local residents baffled since it directs motorists on a huge journey taking almost two hours			1
@entity34 , @entity35 and @entity7 town councillor , today hit out at the county council for authorising roadworks that will cause such lengthy delays			2
he said : ' this has to qualify as the @entity16 ’s longest - ever diversion route caused by such a minor set of roadworks			0
' it is just laughable that @entity12 really expects motorists to drive almost 50 miles across the region to avoid a few hundred metres of road			1
' there are plenty of shorter , more sensible , local routes to take			0
' motorists approaching @entity7 from the south will from monday see road signs directing them to turn around away from @entity54 and go back along the @entity55 to @entity56			2
the half - mile stretch of road will be closed for just over a week ' laughable ' : @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity7 town councillor , today hit out at the county council for authorising roadworks that will cause such lengthy delays they are then told to drive inland along the @entity63 to @entity64 and @entity65 before travelling north to @entity66 along the @entity67 to @entity68 , before picking up the @entity55 at @entity69 and travelling southbound back to @entity7			2
@entity71 ’s online mapping facility calculates that the diversion is 47.1miles long and will take drivers around 1 hour , 43 minutes to complete - considerably longer than the 30 seconds it usually takes to drive along the 680metres of @entity54 that will be temporarily closed			0
but @entity76 , @entity35 and @entity7 town clerk , said : ' the alternative route might look extreme			2
' it is being put in place by the county council to try and divert motorists , particularly those with heavy goods vehicles , away from minor roads with weak bridges			0
' a @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ it does seem ridiculous that legally the council has to put this lengthy diversion in place			1
‘ in reality we all know that locals will find alternative short routes and lorry drivers will use sat nav and use the motorway			0
‘ we apologise for any inconvenience this has caused but it is only for a short period and only affects the few			0

the ' laughable ' diversion , which has been put in place around @entity7 by @entity12 , is scheduled to begin on monday
