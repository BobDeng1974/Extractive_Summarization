by @entity0 a blonde model with blue eyes will say a prayer for @entity4 on thursday			1
it is the same ritual @entity6 has practised on each of the 19 previous anniversaries of the driver 's death			1
a person of faith like @entity4 - ' i believe in the lord ' - she has spoken to @entity15 about that weekend 20 years ago when the @entity17 her boyfriend was driving crashed into a concrete wall at @entity19 at @entity20 , killing him			1
she remembers the last hours spent at @entity4 's villa in the @entity22 in the countdown to the @entity24			1
black day : @entity4 with his girlfriend @entity6 , and right , the blonde model cries at his funeral crash : @entity4 's death on lap seven of the @entity24 , 20 years ago , rocked the sporting world ' he phoned me , ' she says			1
' he was not well			2
his head was not right			2
' @entity34 , his good friend , was in hospital ( after an accident in friday practice )			2
he was very upset by the death of @entity39 , a fellow driver who died on saturday ( in qualifying )			2
he told me , " i 'm very sad "			2
' i had known him anguished before but never heard his voice like it was that day			2
i remember telling him , " @entity4 , do n't enter that race "			1
' the advice @entity6 gave @entity4 , the thrice world champion and arguably the greatest driver of all time , echoed the words of professor @entity48 , the @entity49 's friend and @entity51 's medical delegate as well as one of the world 's leading brain surgeons			1
he told him to pack it all in and ' let 's go fishing '			0
while @entity4 was undoubtedly emotional having visited the site of @entity39 's crash , there is a suggestion that his relationship with @entity6 itself was preying on his mind			1
in @entity4 , o @entity66 ( @entity4 , the @entity67 ) , author @entity65 claims that @entity6 had contacted her former lover and that @entity4 's brother , @entity69 , had played tapes of these secret conversations to him			1
@entity72 moment : @entity4 , seen here celebrating his famous win at @entity75 in 1992 , won three world titles the author , a former @entity78 bureau chief of @entity49 's @entity80 tv channel , visited seven countries and spoke to 213 people during two years researching the book			1
however , @entity4 's sister @entity84 has denied that any member of the family talked to @entity65			1
' my goal is not to talk about a book that i have n't read , ' @entity84 once said , growing upset when pressed on the claims about @entity6 's behaviour			1
i put the accusation to galisteu herself			0
' it never happened , no. i was 100 per cent honest with @entity4			1
i recall his skin and his smell			0
i only told him truths			0
i was a young girl and shortly after i first knew him i took him home to get to know my mum and my brother , the place where i lived and how i lived			0
' she says that she fell in love with him when they met at the @entity103 , where she was an umbrella girl			0
she had long admired him from afar but never imagined they would become lovers			0
determined : @entity4 , pictured here on the day before he died , was said to have been ' not right ' prior to the race ' when i tried to tell him not to race at @entity20 , he told me that he loved his profession and he could n't just pull out of the race , ' she remembers			1
" it is my life "			0
his strong inclination to race is corroborated by @entity4 's manager , @entity115 , one of the most respected figures in the paddock			1
he told me that , though @entity4 was upset like everyone else by the events of the weekend , he spoke to @entity17 , the team boss , and decided to compete			1
' stories saying he did not want to race are simply not true , ' said @entity115			0
back in @entity121 , @entity6 watched the race on tv			1
' i saw the accident and thought nothing of it , ' she said			0
' in fact , i thought , " good , he 'll be back early , thank goodness "			0
' but then i saw it was more serious than i first imagined			0
i stood in front of the tv and watched the replay over and over again			0
i could see the car was damaged but i never thought he had died			0
on the podium : @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 react to the news of @entity4 's death ' i answered the phone and it was the wife of his best friend telling me i must get over to @entity20			1
we went on a private jet from @entity147			0
i got on the plane thinking he was still alive ; hurt but not killed			2
' back at @entity20 , @entity4 had been taken out of the car and flown to hospital			1
after a 37 - minute delay , the race restarted , to be won by @entity138 , who was driving in a @entity153 believed by @entity4 to have flouted that season 's new rules outlawing traction control			1
no champagne was sprayed on the podium			0
' when the plane was about to take off , the pilot said there was a call from the tower			0
i imagined it was @entity4 saying , " you do n't need to come , everything is ok "			1
' it was a friend : " @entity6 , you do n't need to come "			1
" wow , that 's good " , i said , thinking he must be improving			0
" no , he 's dead "			0
my world stopped at that moment			2
' in my head it was impossible : he could only die of old age			0
it was incredible that he died doing what he knew best in life			0
it was very difficult for @entity49 , for the whole world , but even more for me			2
it took me many years to recover my life , especially amorously			2
' @entity6 , seen here in 2009 , claimed @entity4 wanted to end his career with the famous @entity185 outfit @entity184 @entity186 : march 21 , 1960 , @entity187 , @entity188 : may 1 , 1994 , @entity189 , @entity185 , aged @entity190 : @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 : 1988 , 1990 , @entity195 : @entity196 : 41podium finishes : @entity197 : 65 ( inc record eight consecutive ) first @entity199 : @entity49 @entity24 , @entity200 ( @entity201 ) 912 a @entity202 ( @entity203 ) 513 a @entity4 ( @entity49 ) 41most wins at the @entity205 ( @entity49 ) @entity206 ( @entity207 ) @entity208 ( @entity201 ) @entity209 ( @entity49 ) @entity210 holds the record for the most consecutive pole positions with eight			1
@entity6 , who has just turned 41 , married @entity213 in june 2010 and has a three - year - old son , @entity214			1
' my time with @entity4 was a great love story			1
he was loved across the world more than he ever knew			2
his memory will never be erased			0
for me , it was special , but now i am married and have a child			0
it means i can not say he was the love of my life			0
' she remembers the remarkable funeral in @entity187 , when the whole sprawling city stopped to mourn its icon : the brooding , brilliant , ruthless , clever , mystical , megalomaniacal @entity4			1
' i spent as long as i could with his body			0
i did n't go home			0
' @entity4 had three dreams , ' she says fondly			1
' the first was to finish his career at @entity184 ; the second was to get to know @entity237 ; the third was to become a father			1
' he was more than a champion			2
he had an enormous heart , a simple way of life and had simple dreams			0
at home , he was like a child			0
he was full of happiness			0
' @entity248 man : @entity4 won 41 races and secured 65 poles during a career which promised so much more @entity4 's death shook @entity51 more profoundly than that of any other			1
before the @entity255 rookie @entity39 , no driver had died for 12 years			2
@entity256 , the three - time world champion , said : ' @entity257 has had his hand over @entity51 for a long time			1
this weekend , he took it away			0
' secondly , the whole dramatic scene was beamed around the world on tv , giving it a global impact never known before			2
@entity265 later described it as the hardest commentary of his life , treading a fine line between empty optimism and morbid fatalism as he watched , unable to know precisely how serious @entity4 's predicament was			2
in @entity20 , today and for the next four days , there will be races in honour of the man who won 41 races and 65 poles			1
his death prompted safety provisions that have ensured no driver has died in a @entity51 cockpit since			2
wheel - to - wheel : @entity4 and @entity284 fight for first place at the @entity286 less favourably , his ruthlessness on track - most notably in driving @entity289 off in 1990 - set the tempo for some of the less chivalrous driving that followed			1
( in fairness , as @entity193 boss @entity295 observed , @entity4 's superlative talent and mercilessness was matched and abetted by @entity289 in their glorious rivalry			2
) the most intriguing question is raised by @entity301 's trial in @entity201 and the doubts it prompts over the 83 - year - old 's future at the head of @entity51 : could @entity4 have taken over from @entity301 ? @entity4 was clever , calculating , sharp , cowed by nobody and saw commercial opportunities way ahead of his time			1
just before he died , he struck a deal with @entity310 to import their road cars			0
the arrangement stood until @entity310 opened a factory in @entity49 in 1999			0
he even caused @entity301 to change the terms of the super licence by doing a deal with @entity318 before a @entity320 contract had been signed with @entity321			0
from then on , @entity301 ensured that a driver 's electronic media rights were signed over to him			0
we mourn the loss of a driver of sublime brilliance			0
perhaps we join @entity6 in saying a prayer for him			2
but we should also ponder the role he might now be taking on in @entity51 but for that afternoon at @entity20 .			1

@entity6 said she asked @entity4 to withdraw from the ill - fated @entity24
the model has denied claims she was having an affair with her former lover at the time of the *tragedy* which rocked @entity51
@entity6 said @entity4 , who was killed 20 years ago after crashing into a concrete wall at @entity19 , wanted to end his career at @entity184
in @entity20 , there will be races in honour of the three - time world champion
