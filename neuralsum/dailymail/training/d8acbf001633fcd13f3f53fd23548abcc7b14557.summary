by @entity0 a baker who lost a discrimination case for turning away a gay couple has revealed he will stop making wedding cakes completely			1
@entity5 , 57 , refused to bake a wedding cake for @entity8 residents @entity9 , 29 , and @entity10 , 34 - despite it being claimed he was happy to make one for two dogs			1
the couple sued him and won in a landmark case , which saw the @entity15 unanimously declare free speech and business should be separate			1
rising anger : @entity19 @entity5 , from @entity8 , @entity20 , said he will stop baking wedding cakes completely after a landmark ruling declared he was wrong to refuse an order from a gay couple on the grounds of belief court battle : @entity10 , 34 ( left ) and his husband @entity9 , 29 ( right ) have fought the decision for almost two years after the @entity30 took up their case			1
mr @entity9 said he was ' thrilled ' now mr @entity5 has revealed he will stop baking wedding cakes altogether so he will not be ' forced to participate ' in a same - sex ceremony			1
he told @entity34 : ' we would close down the bakery before we would complicate our beliefs			0
' if it 's just a birthday , i have no problem with that			0
my issue is that i do n't want to be forced to participate in a same - sex wedding '			0
but the @entity44 , which also employs his sister and 87 - year - old mother , is unlikely to go out of business			2
he claimed had been so overwhelmed by supporters eager to buy cookies and brownies that he does not need to make wedding cakes any more			2
it has been illegal to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation since 2008 in @entity20 , which legalised same - sex ' beneficiary agreements ' the following year			1
last year the state legalised same - sex civil unions			0
however , gay marriage remains illegal in @entity20 and the couple 's ceremony in september 2012 was held in @entity65 , followed by the reception at their @entity8 home			1
loving : the couple at their home in @entity8 , @entity20 , where they had the reception			1
gay marriage is still illegal in @entity20 so they had to hold the ceremony itself in @entity65 , where it was legalised in 2004 home life : the couple playing cards			1
in the ruling , @entity20 civil rights commissioner @entity79 said : ' i can believe anything i want , but if i 'm going to do business here , i 'd ought to not discriminate against people ' ordinary : the couple said they never intended to become the focus of a global campaign , but were just angry the panel this week ordered @entity5 to stop discriminating against gay people and to report quarterly for two years on staff anti-discrimination training and any customers he refuses to serve			1
commissioner @entity79 said : ' i can believe anything i want , but if i 'm going to do business here , i 'd ought to not discriminate against people			0
' mr @entity9 said he was ' thrilled '			2
' the next time a gay couple wanders in there asking for a wedding cake , they wo n’t have the experience we had , ' he said			1
' they will have a responsible experience and leave feeling respected			0
' the @entity108 baker has said he may appeal the ruling			0
this commission 's decision confirmed a lower court 's finding in december that @entity5 had violated civil rights law			1
it was the end of a two - year battle which began after a furious mr @entity9 wrote a report of his encounter on @entity119			2
support : the baker said he had been inundated with people wanting to buy cupcakes and brownies from him @entity108 mr @entity5 had refused service to gay couples before because he claimed it was against the @entity129 the baker said : ' in everything i do , i think about how people will perceive @entity132 through me , by what i sell ' ' today , @entity10 and i went to cake shop to get a wedding cake and were turned away and informed they did not serve gay weddings , ' he wrote			1
' i am furious ! but , i 'm also not going to take this lying down			0
' he posted the address and phone number of @entity44 in @entity8 , @entity20 , on @entity119 and the reaction soon spiralled into a full - blown campaign			1
ceremony : the couple wed in 2012			0
the ' equals ' symbol stands for equal marriage mr @entity9 and mr @entity10 campaigned outside the shop with placards declaring ' @entity151 ' and it was inundated with phone calls			1
the couple said they never intended to become the focus of a global campaign , but were just angry			0
the baker had insisted after the encounter , which lasted less than a minute , that he was just sticking to his @entity108 beliefs			2
but the @entity30 - which took the case to court - then claimed a lesbian couple found out mr @entity5 was happy to bake a wedding cake for two dogs			1
an @entity30 spokesman said : ' they wanted to order some cupcakes to celebrate their commitment ceremony ... but the store refused to take their order , informing the couple that they have a strict policy against selling cakes for same - sex weddings and ceremonies			0
' then @entity176 tried a little experiment			0
she called the bakery and told the owner , @entity5 , that she was planning to host a wedding celebration for two dogs			1
' she told him that the dog wedding cake would need to feed 20 people and should be decorated with the names " @entity184 " and " @entity185			2
" ' without hesitation , @entity5 quoted her a price and asked how soon she needed it			2
' the incident was one of several which inspired legislation in at least 11 states that would have allowed business owners to cite their religious beliefs in denying service to patrons			1
most of the proposed laws , however , were knocked dead amid a national outcry that they would legalise discrimination			0
mr @entity5 previously said he loved his work because it improves people 's lives , and ' that 's what @entity132 does '			2
he added : ' in everything i do , i think about how people will perceive @entity132 through me , by what i sell , what i make '			0
one of his display cakes depicted a trio of crosses on a hill , with the words ' he has @entity216			0
' he had not been deeply religious until after he fathered two children , when he was driving one day and had an epiphany			0
' @entity219 convicted me of my sin ' , he said			0
the baker said he once employed a gay man in his shop and insisted he makes regular birthday cakes for a lesbian couple			2
how it all began : the battle started almost two years ago when mr @entity9 posted this photo on @entity119 campaign : the couple then stood in the streets with placards and the shop was inundated with calls when mr @entity10 and mr @entity9 were growing up , meanwhile , gay marriage was a foreign concept			1
mr @entity10 graduated from high school in @entity238 the same year @entity239 , a gay @entity240 student , was killed because of his orientation			2
he said he still feels awkward holding hands in public , adding : ' i feel like something bad could happen to us			0
' an @entity30 spokesman said : ' @entity248 owners have claimed their policy is based on their " reading of the @entity129			0
" ' but their business is not a house of worship			0
@entity20 law allows members of the clergy to decide whom they will join in a marriage or civil union – and that 's consistent with the principles of religious liberty our nation was founded on			1
' while bakery owners are free to practice their faith and to personally oppose same - sex marriage , they can not use those beliefs as an excuse to disrespect and discriminate against customers			2
' the store has no more right to turn away a gay couple than to turn away an interracial couple			0
