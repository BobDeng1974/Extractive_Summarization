a nurse yesterday told how her elderly mother starved herself to death in what the pensioner considered her only legal way to exercise her right to die			1
@entity7 said she initially struggled to reconcile feelings of extreme anger with a desire to support @entity12 ’s right to die ‘ on her own terms ’			1
twice - widowed mrs @entity12 , 86 , a long - term right - to - die campaigner , had been battling an increasing number of chronic health conditions – but was not terminally ill – when she ‘ reached a point where she did n’t want to go on ’ at the end of this summer			1
@entity12 , 86 , a life - long right to die campaigner , poses for a portrait with her daughter @entity23 at her home in @entity25 september 2014 the former maths teacher began refusing food on august 28 – five weeks before she eventually died on october 1 , just hours after being visited for the final time by a gp who had agreed to treat the symptoms of starvation and dehydration			1
she stopped drinking water on september 16			1
yesterday her daughter , who is married but has kept her maiden name , said : ‘ i was very angry when my mother first told me of her decision			1
' however , i recognised that this was n’t about me			0
we are all respectful of the fact that it was her life and her choice			0
’ miss @entity12 added : ‘ my mother was a fiercely independent lady who had the capacity to make this decision			1
' she had been talking about doing this for the last two or three years , if her health deteriorated – although that ’s not to say we ever thought it would actually happen			0
she was becoming increasingly restricted in what she could do			0

’ assisting or encouraging a suicide remains a criminal offence in the @entity61			0
but last week @entity62 , the @entity63 , issued new guidance to @entity66 lawyers suggesting doctors or carers in such cases should only be prosecuted if they ‘ may have exerted influence on the victim ’			2
miss @entity12 , 63 , from @entity72 , said her mother suffered from fainting episodes throughout her life , which last autumn progressed to her collapsing unconscious in the middle of the night			1
mrs @entity12 also suffered chronic back pain			1
although she was still travelling independently around @entity61 by train until the spring , and was technologically literate enough to order her own grocery shopping online into the summer , she suffered a further ‘ episode of acute ill - health ’ in may			1
the former maths teacher began refusing food on august 28 – five weeks before she eventually died miss @entity12 declined to go into further detail about the nature of her ‘ remarkable ’ mother ’s various health conditions			1
mrs @entity12 had been a right - to - die campaigner for decades			1
a former chairman of the @entity89 , she wrote a book in 1997 which called for doctors to be allowed to help patients die			1
in the absence of @entity61 laws permitting assisted dying , and unwilling to travel to the @entity97 assisted suicide clinic in @entity98 , she believed starvation was the only legal option of ending her life available to her			0
she feared an overdose of medication would not work			0
@entity12 might have been able to find a doctor to help her commit suicide under new prosecution guidelines slipped into operation last week which mean a doctor who assists a suicide is unlikely , in the right circumstances , to be prosecuted			2
until last week the rules said that any doctor , nurse , medical professional or carer who takes part in an assisted suicide should be prosecuted under the @entity119			0
director of public prosecutions @entity62 altered the guidance last week in a move condemned by anti-euthanasia campaigners			0
her predecessor @entity124 published guidelines in 2010 on who would be prosecuted for helping a suicide which said broadly that no one would be prosecuted if they acted out of compassion rather than greed or malice			0
however , they warned that a medical professional would be prosecuted if the suicide victim was ‘ in his or her care ’ , whether or not they were being paid			2
mrs @entity62 has now said the phrase ‘ in his or her care ’ will apply only to doctors who know the suicide victim and have been in a position to influence their thinking			2
@entity147 ’s @entity146 would allow a doctor to provide lethal drugs to someone who is terminally ill and expected to die within six months			0
mrs @entity12 , from @entity25 , contacted the @entity151 four weeks into her fast			1
in the interview published yesterday , she described her situation as her body shut down as ‘ hell ’			2
she added : ‘ i ca n’t tell you how hard it is			0
' you would n’t decide this unless you thought your life was going to be so bad			0
what alternative do i have ? ’ she admitted that her family ‘ do n’t want me to die ’ , but added : ‘ they give me absolute right to make my own choices			2
’ the former choir singer began starving herself after enjoying a final piece of a cake she had baked herself			0
when she stopped drinking water it left her mouth so dry she had difficulty talking			0
miss @entity12 said her mother had n’t realised it might take weeks rather than days to die after she stopped drinking			1
in her final weeks , mrs @entity12 was looked after by her four children and two grown - up grandchildren , who took it in turns to visit			2
she died peacefully at home with miss @entity7 and her grandson at her side			0
miss @entity12 yesterday declined to identify the @entity188 surgery which treated her mother			2
but her doctor , a @entity190 who does not believe in assisted dying , told the @entity151 he had treated her after consulting his defence union who ruled ‘ you can not force someone to eat if they have capacity ’			0
miss @entity12 said the case had been referred to the coroner , who was waiting for medical reports before deciding whether an inquest would be necessary			0
@entity202 , chief executive of @entity89 , said the group supported @entity147 ’s @entity146 , which would enable competent adults who are terminally ill to request assistance to end their own life			2
dr @entity207 , campaign director of @entity208 , said he feared mrs @entity12 ’s case could be ‘ seized upon by the pro-euthanasia lobby to further their agenda of legalising assisted suicide and euthanasia ’ .			1
