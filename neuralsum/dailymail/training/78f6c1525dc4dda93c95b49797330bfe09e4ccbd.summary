a $ 900million nuclear submarine had to be scrapped after a worker started a small blaze because he wanted to go home early - and firefighters had no idea how to put it out , it has been claimed			1
investigators say a fire on board the @entity9 at the @entity10 in 2012 got out of control because of confusion over who was supposed to deal with the blaze			1
local firefighters rushing to the scene were sent back to base by naval commanders before having to be recalled when the order was overturned , wasting vital minutes , says a report			2
the $ 900million @entity9 ( pictured ) had to be scrapped after a small blaze got out of control because firefighters had no experience of fighting blazes on ships , a report says no water was put on to the flames for two hours at a time because the rescue effort was badly organised and firemen had no experience of tacking a blaze on board a boat , according to a report			1
investigators said the fire was started by a disgruntled worker who wanted to go home early , but quickly spread , damaging the living quarters , the command and control center and a torpedo room			1
the sub was being repaired in a dry dock when the flames took hold			1
fortunately the blaze did not reach the nuclear engines			0
the report added : ' @entity52 had set in , based on the infrequency of shipyard fires and relative success of fire prevention measures			0
' also , there was an assumption that the proximity to far more assets , especially federal firefighters , reduced the likelihood of a fire not being quickly contained			0
' this organizational reluctance to prepare for a fire of this scale should serve as a wake - up call â€” large fires can and do happen in industrial environments			0
' the @entity70 launched a series of investigations that led to recommendations , including the installation of temporary automatic fire detection systems while vessels are being repaired or overhauled			1
it also issued a new fire safety and prevention manual , and says it has learned lessons which are being applied across the fleet			0
seven people were injured fighting the flames which damaged the living quarters , the command and control center and a torpedo room - but luckily did not reach the nuclear engines ( pictured , fire damage on board ) @entity70 chiefs considered flooding the dry dock to douse the flames after it looked like the ship might be lost , but fire crews battled on in small corridors with almost no visibility in an attempt to save it			1
initially it was thought that they had succeeded , but the ship was eventually scrapped when the repair bill topped $ 700million			1
investigators said firefighters were unfamiliar with the submarine 's layout and that there specialist training given on how to fight a fire on a ship , and crews did not know with the layout of the boat			2
however , @entity114 , who was the shipyard fire chief at the time , hit back at the claims , saying irefighters conducted monthly walk - throughs , practiced dragging hoses through submarines and never flunked a drill			2
instead he blamed holes cut into the side of the sub for feeding oxygen to the flames , turning the metal shell into a furnace			0
speaking about firemen , seven on whom were injured fighting the blaze , he said : ' they climbed into the belly of an inferno			0
every one of them was a hero			0
' the @entity135 report included 99 recommendations , virtually all of which were redacted because they were n't final decisions , according to @entity70 spokesman lt. @entity140			2
the @entity70 experiences a fire of comparable magnitude to the @entity9 blaze about every five years , and without corrective action , that pattern would continue , investigators said			1
@entity148 sen. @entity147 of @entity149 , a member of the @entity150 , said he was disappointed the recommendations were n't made public			0
he added that he plans to ask the @entity70 for them , and wants to hold a hearing on firefighting techniques and training to decide whether the force needs more funding			2
' the report documents a very compelling need for better training and more expert firefighters that can help stop such catastrophic fires on submarines , ' he said .			0
