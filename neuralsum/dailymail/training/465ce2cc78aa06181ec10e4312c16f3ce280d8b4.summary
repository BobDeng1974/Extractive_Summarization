by @entity0 published : 10:17 est , 20 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:19 est , 20 february 2014 a pulsar moving at five million miles per hour has delivered the longest jet of high energy particles astronomers have ever seen			1
the jet trail stretches 37 light years , or 218 trillion miles long - ten times as long as the distance between our sun and its nearest star			1
pulsars are rotating neutron stars formed when the core of a massive star undergoes gravitational collapse at the end of its life			1
@entity20 's @entity19 has seen a fast - moving pulsar escaping from a supernova remnant while spewing out a record - breaking jet - the longest of any object in the @entity25 ( seen here in the bottom right ) this pulsar , known as @entity29 - 6103 , and its peculiar behaviour can likely be traced back to its birth in the collapse and subsequent explosion of a massive star			1
the pulsar is located about 60 light - years away from the centre of the supernova remnant @entity38 in the constellation of @entity40			1
spotted by @entity20 's @entity19 , its speed is between 2.5 million and 5 million mph , making it one of the fastest pulsars ever observed			1
‘ we 've never seen an object that moves this fast and also produces a jet , ’ said @entity44 of the @entity45 in @entity46			0
the jet here is seen with x-rays from @entity19			0
this pulsar - a spinning neutron star - is moving between 2.5 million and 5 million miles per hour when the core of a massive star undergoes gravitational collapse at the end of its life , protons and electrons are scrunched together , leaving behind a neutron star			1
neutron stars can fit roughly 1.3 to 2.5 solar masses into a city - sized sphere perhaps 12 miles across			2
matter is packed so tightly that a sugar - cube - sized amount of material would weigh more than 1 billion tonnes			0
most known neutron stars belong to a subclass known as pulsars			2
these relatively young objects rotate extremely rapidly , with some spinning faster than a kitchen blender			0
they beam radio waves in narrow cones , which periodically sweep across @entity79			0
‘ by comparison , this jet is almost 10 times longer than the distance between the sun and our nearest star			1
’ as well as its impressive span , it has a distinct corkscrew pattern that suggests the pulsar is wobbling like a spinning top			1
the pulsar 's jet and the pulsar wind nebula are nearly perpendicular to one another , which is baffling scientists			1
‘ we can see this pulsar is moving directly away from the centre of the supernova remnant based on the shape and direction of the pulsar wind nebula , ’ said co-author @entity98 , from the @entity99 in @entity100			0
‘ the question is , why is the jet pointing off in this other direction ? ’ usually , the spin axis and jets of a pulsar point in the same direction as they are moving , but @entity29 - 6103 's spin axis and direction of motion are almost at right angles			2
‘ with the pulsar moving one way and the jet going another , this gives us clues that exotic physics can occur when some stars collapse , ’ said co-author @entity120 also of the @entity99			2
one possibility requires an extremely fast rotation speed for the iron core of the star that exploded			0
a problem with this scenario is that such fast speeds are not commonly expected to be achievable			0
the supernova remnant that gave birth to @entity139 is elongated from top - right to bottom - left in the image roughly in line with the jet 's direction			2
the strange movements and huge jet could be explained if its parent star 's iron core had an extremely fast rotation speed			0
however , @entity20 said that such fast speeds were not commonly thought to be achievable			0

the pulsar - a spinning neutron star - is located in constellation of @entity40
it is thought to be one of the fastest pulsars ever observed by scientists
jet trail is ten times as long as distance between sun and its nearest star
@entity164 has a corkscrew pattern indicating pulsar is wobbling like a spinning top
