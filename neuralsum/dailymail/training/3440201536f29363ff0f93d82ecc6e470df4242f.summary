@entity0 have revealed they expect their income to surge by £ 25m a year when their expanded main stand opens next year			1
around £ 20m of that cash will come from 8,500 extra seats , including 4,500 corporate seats			1
the club also hope to make £ 5m a year from getting a naming rights sponsor for the stand - while keeping the name @entity10 for the ground as a whole			1
extra income could also follow because the new @entity10 will be eligible and fit to stage major @entity15 club finals			1
the details are revealed in an interview with @entity0 ’s chief executive @entity18 in the new edition of @entity21 magazine			2
@entity0 desperately need extra match - day income to help them catch up with major rivals already housed in much bigger stadiums , not least @entity25 and @entity26			1
stadium expansion work began in december on the redevelopment of the @entity29 at @entity10 by the start of the 2016 - 17 season it is expected that the stadium redevelopment will be completed 45,000 - @entity10 's current capacity 54,000 - capacity after initial expansion 58,800 - potential capacity after second phase 8,500 - phase one to extend the @entity29 4,500 - phase two to extend @entity10 end £ 75m - cost of extension by 2016/17 season £ 260m - cost of overall regeneration in @entity10 @entity10 ’s current capacity is just shy of 45,500 and the first phase of expansion - with building work just underway - will take that to 54,000 by the start of the 2016 - 17 season			1
a second phase could see the @entity49 expanded later by a further 4,800 seats			0
the expansion will cost £ 100m but the club will reap the benefits in the medium term			2
@entity18 insists that adding a sizable amount of higher - priced corporate seats , often known as ‘ prawn sandwich ’ places , is key to the scheme ’s viability			2
‘ corporate hospitality revenues are essential , ’ @entity18 says			0
‘ if we had increased capacity by 8,500 general admission seats only , it would have taken a ridiculous time to pay back the investment , meaning revenues into the team would have been affected			1
‘ but the large corporate increase means we will pay the debt back quickly and not be saddled with debt , while quickly increasing revenues into the playing squad			0
@entity0 's new @entity29 will be made up of three tiers and will include premium seating for @entity77 fans the @entity29 will have two new tiers added to take the capacity to over 53,000 by start of 2016 - 17 season ‘ the club wants the return on investment as quickly as makes sense			1
@entity0 has to be sustainable			0
we have formulated a model that gives a fast return of the capital expenditure over five to six years , but that will also allow the club to enjoy some benefits from the expansion even before that time			0
beyond the five or six years , we will of course really see more revenues on the bottom line			0
’ @entity0 ’s @entity98 owners @entity96 , who also own @entity98 baseball team the @entity101 and successfully modernised their @entity102 , are effectively lending @entity0 the stadium expansion money in the form of an interest - free loan , bypassing the need to meet crippling bank charges			1
the £ 5m - a - year potential income in naming rights is an estimate floated by experts in that field			1
@entity18 says : ‘ the commercial department is in talks with various people			0
we did n’t think that looking for a naming rights deal on a stadium as iconic as @entity10 made sense , but there are real value and benefits to be had around a naming rights deal on the new stand			2
there was plenty of building activity from workers on the opening day of the @entity130 redevelopment ‘ it is not just a question of how much a deal is worth , but more about which deal would allow the club and partner to enjoy the most benefit			0
’ not only will the club benefit enormously from the expansion , so will the wider area , with local regeneration directly creating 360 new long - term jobs according to economists			0
the numbers exclude construction and supply chain jobs , which , if included would see 770 jobs created			0
the redevelopment will also allow @entity0 to host international fixtures and @entity15 finals in the future			0
@entity151 insist upon at least a 50,000 - capacity stadium , corporate accommodation and a minimum standard for players and match officials ’ changing rooms - which will all be passed once the first phase has been completed .			2

expansion of main @entity10 stand is set to be completed in time for 2016 - 17
capacity will be increased from just shy of 45,500 to 54,000
@entity0 expect to earn an extra £ 25m per year from the expansion
extra seats will bring in £ 20m with a further £ 5m from sponsorship
