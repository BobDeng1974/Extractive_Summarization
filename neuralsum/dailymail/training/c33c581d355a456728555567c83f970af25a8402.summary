by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:45 est , 22 september 2012 updated : 02:04 est , 24 september 2012 @entity2 is perched on an arm of a purple velour sofa in her glass - walled @entity6 office , and talking , without a blush , about sex			1
‘ i ’ve never met anyone who will tell you , “ i ’m having too much sex ” , ’ she says			1
‘ i think we ’ve forgotten about the power of sex			1
that if you have a healthy sex life , you ’re likely to live longer , you ’re going to be happier , your skin will be better , your hair will be better			1
‘ most people would like to have more sex but we ’re all working really long hours and everybody is connected to work and social media so there is this tremendous pressure to stay engaged all the time			1
’ @entity29 , born and brought up in @entity26 in a village outside @entity28 , is the newly - appointed editor - in - chief of @entity31 , the world ’s largest women ’s magazine and it is one of the most talked - about magazine appointments in @entity37 for years			1
@entity38 , pictured with @entity2 , really need sex advice ? she and ex @entity41 - @entity40 were said to have had a sex dungeon @entity2 's pal @entity43 is already pretty racy			1
she has a habit of smashing up cars			2
likes lots of lovers , not a steady guy the magazine is read by millions in the @entity37 and @entity51 and is published in 64 countries around the @entity53 it says about sex is hugely influential in shaping the attitudes of a whole generation of young women			1
@entity31 is already a title infamously , almost comically , associated with sex yet @entity29 has a mission and it is this : to help women not only have healthier and happier , but also more active , sex lives as well			1
@entity29 continues : ‘ i do n’t think sex needs to be fancy , where you have orgasms that are a symphony of glory and musicians appear at the end of the bed playing @entity72 , or where you have to be tied up and wearing the latest @entity73			2
i think it ’s fine to have 20 or 30 minutes of kissing and hugging and plain , old sex			2
sex is this fantastic connector and it ’s free			2
it ’s a great way to improve communication			2
the other thing i ’ve realised is that you do n’t have to be rich to have great sex , and that ’s a good thing in this economy			2
’ there ’s already an app which she looks up on her @entity89			2
‘ i ’m already in shock about the 365 positions			2
obviously i ’ve got a lot of learning to do , ’ she says with a poker face			2
she peers at the diagram on her screen illustrating what appears to be a particularly gymnastic approach to the act of love and starts to laugh			2
‘ today , it ’s @entity104 to @entity105 , ’ she announces			2
in her @entity37 size 6 @entity108 dress ( a @entity51 size 10 ) and peep - toed @entity111 shoes , @entity29 at 50 , has , as they say , arrived			1
with sooty eyelashes , polished complexion and a crop of expensive blonde hair , she exudes pared - down chic			1
from her office on the 38th floor of the @entity122 - designed glass and steel skyscraper of @entity123 ’ headquarters in midtown , her adopted city unfolds majestically beyond her windows			1
' today 's sex position on our @entity128 is @entity130 to @entity105 ' @entity131 editor - in - chief @entity2 ‘ this is the view that i came to @entity134 for , ’ she declares			1
‘ it ’s taken me a bit of time to earn this view … it ’s amazing , is n’t it ? ’ on her desk is a copy of the feminist @entity144 ’s infamous new book @entity145 , next to a dvd of the @entity148 ’s political satire @entity147			2
there is a shelf crammed with photographs of @entity29 with @entity37 ’s great and good including @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154			2
‘ that ’s my ego wall , ’ she laughs			2
‘ @entity157 , it ’s going to sound dreadful in @entity51 but over here everyone has one			2
people think it ’s strange if you do n’t have one			0
’ @entity164 - nobbing with presidents and movie stars , @entity29 , a mother of two and assiduous networker , has come a long way from her @entity26 upbringing			1
her father was a teacher and her mother a medical social worker – who both encouraged her to believe she could do whatever she wanted			0

@entity2 went on to graduate from the @entity181 with a degree in @entity183 and @entity37 literature			1
since then she has made a determined push for the top			0
from the spectator she went to the @entity188 and @entity189			0
four years after arriving in @entity6 in 1997 as @entity189 ’s @entity134 correspondent , she had the chance to return to @entity192 as a parliamentary sketchwriter for another newspaper			0
looking out of her window last week , she surmises that if she had taken the job she would be , ‘ living in @entity197 right now , still working as a sketchwriter and having a really great life			0
but what ’s fun about @entity134 is that it ’s so much bigger ’			0
last year , after improving both circulation and advertising as editor of @entity206 , she shrewdly let it be known she was thinking about her next move			1
when @entity209 , editor of @entity131 for 14 years , announced that she was stepping down , @entity2 was in pole position to replace her			1
she now plans to update the fashion coverage and add a campaigning aspect to the magazine			1
‘ i want @entity31 to be right in the middle of the fight that ’s going on in @entity37 about abortion , birth control and women ’s health issues			1
we ’re living in the dark ages in @entity37 in terms of women ’s access to contraception , ’ she says			1

‘ i had a great time in my 20s , ’ she remembers			0
‘ i had a few boyfriends but mainly , like all my female friends , i was focused on getting my career in the right place so i was n’t in any hurry to settle down			0
‘ we really did live our version of @entity225 , only in @entity249			0
it was brunches and trips and shopping and panicking about whether our bosses thought we were doing a good enough job			0
i knew i would eventually have children , i just wanted to feel financially secure before i did			0
’ she says she wishes she had not been so sensible and had taken more risks			0
she met her husband @entity258 , a writer and human rights activist , when she was 28 and they have two sons – @entity262 , 13 , and @entity263 , ten			0
the family lives on the @entity265 of the city in a large apartment where they entertain a glossy mix of actors , media types and politicians			0
@entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 and sir @entity277 are all part of what @entity2 describes as ‘ her posse ’			1
@entity29 tweets and has taken part in reality tv shows such as @entity285 and @entity286			0
she is also making a film with @entity288 , who produced @entity289			0
‘ it ’s based on an article that appeared in @entity206 about a man who asked his wife if he could have a threesome for his 40th birthday			0
she reluctantly agreed as long as she could choose the woman			0
i think every studio in @entity299 wanted to buy the story			0
’ does all this activity leave much time for family ? ‘ i do n’t feel guilty about working full - time or suffer maternal guilt			1
i ’m there when my kids wake up in the mornings – unless i ’m in @entity309 or @entity310 , ’ she says			0
‘ i ’m not a helicopter parent by nature and managing family and work is easier when you ’re the boss because you control your own schedule			0
’ she is still getting to know her editorial team but has already scolded them for not going out to enough parties			0
‘ i want us to fan out like a @entity131 army of sexily clad young women every single evening and bring back intelligence from the social frontlines of @entity6 , ’ she says			1
@entity2 adds that she used to have ‘ a truly dreadful fashion sense ’ but has learned over the years how to make the best of herself			1
‘ buy everything a size bigger and get it tailored , ’ she says			0
‘ that ’s the best dressing tip i can give anyone			0
’ her wider family still lives in @entity26 and @entity29 has a sort of @entity335 grittiness that keeps her grounded			1
‘ one of the first people i heard from when i got the job was @entity339 , ’ she says			0
‘ she ’s in her 80s and sent me the nicest letter saying we should have lunch and do some @entity26 bonding			1
i was like – fantastic – break out the @entity346 and the @entity348 teabags ! ’ @entity29 may be in charge of the world ’s biggest women ’s magazine but she still baulks at having her own photograph taken			1
