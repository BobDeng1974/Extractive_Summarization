by @entity0 playing golf is about to get a whole lot easier - as courses across the @entity4 introduce a 15 - inch hole on the putting green			1
the hole will be boosted from 4 inches to 15 inches in a pilot scheme - which is to be trialled at 100 courses across the country			1
it is hoped the move will improve player 's scores , increase game speed and encourage more beginners to take up the sport - which has lost around five million players in the @entity4 alone over the past 10 years			1
the average size of a golf hole is to be increased to 15inches in a pilot scheme which will be introduced to 100 courses across the @entity4 and @entity23			1
it is hoped the move will encourage more people to take up the sport @entity28 , pictured during day one of the @entity29 at @entity30 , says the holes will help encourage more beginners to take up the sport the new holes , which will be about the size of an average pizza , have the backing of @entity38 , the president of the @entity39			1
he said : ' we â€™ve got to stop scaring people away from golf by telling them that there is only one way to play the game			1
' the @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48 , is to install the 15 - inch holes			1
top players @entity28 and @entity51 played on the new course during a promotional event held last month			2
at the event , mr @entity28 said : ' a 15in hole could help junior golfers , beginning golfers and older golfers score better , play faster and like golf more			1
' one course in @entity23 , the @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity62 , is also to install the larger holes			0
@entity64 , managing director of the course , told @entity66 : ' younger folks just do n't think it 's cool			0
' @entity69 has n't really grown			0
it has n't really declined			0
it 's just staying stable			0
@entity72 reacts to he misses a putt on the 14th green during the 2008 masters in @entity48			0
the game has slipped in popularity across the country - with five million people abandoning the game in the past decade @entity51 misses a putt on 18th hole at the @entity83			1
the sport is thought to have originated in @entity85 in the 15th century - although some suggest it originates from the @entity88 game paganica ' if you can take out some of the frustration out the game ... the more relaxed they are , the more they 'll enjoy their day , and the more they 'll want to come back			1
' according to the @entity95 , the sport has lost about 5million @entity4 players in a decade			1
their research found that players under the age of 35 , many of whom say it is too difficult , are most likely to give up playing			2
nobody was available from the golf 's professional body , @entity106 , to comment on the changes			2
golf historians differ as to where the game originated			2
some say it originated in @entity85 in the 15th century			0
however , others insist the sport dates back to the @entity88 game of paganica - where players used a bent stick to hit a leather ball			1
certain historians say paganica spread through @entity120 as the @entity121 conquered the continent before it developed into the modern game			0
a boost in hole size is far from the only change in golfing history			2
until the fifties , a golfer was not allowed to move an opponent 's ball if it fell in front of theirs			0
after a series of revisions , the so - called @entity135 was abolished in 1952			0
until 1974 , golfers were allowed to use a ball that was 1.62inches in diameter in the @entity142 - but it was made illegal in 1988			0
since then , the @entity145 's 1.68inch diameter model has been the only one allowed			0
currently , if a player wishes to drop their ball back in to play , they must extend their arm out in from of them and drop it from shoulder height			0
until 1984 , the ball had to be dropped over the shoulder			0
previously , players were penalised if an element beyond their control caused their ball to move on the green			1
however , after several high - profile players were affected , the @entity145 took action and from 2012 , players are allowed to play from the new spot if their ball moves due to reasons beyond their control			1
those using long putters - such as @entity166 and @entity167 - were hit with a shake - up last year			0
although the 2013 @entity145 rule does n't completely ban long putters - which are , as the name suggests , longer versions of their regular counterparts - it prohibits players from anchoring them to their body during the stroke			2
following the controversial ruling , @entity145 executive director @entity178 said : ' this decision gets back to the @entity145 and @entity106 feeling that fundamentally golf for 600 years has been about picking up the club , gripping it with two hands and making a free swing away from the body			2

courses across the @entity4 to increase 4 - inch hole to 15 inches
hoped the move will encourage more people to take up the sport
comes as figures show golf has lost 5million players in the @entity4 in ten years
