by @entity0 @entity1 fears the @entity2 will be badly damaged by the absence of three of the nation ’s largest clubs next season			1
and the @entity9 assistant manager has also expressed concerns the national team ’s progress could falter if @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 fail to quickly return to the top flight			1
addressing the radically changing landscape of @entity19 football ahead of tuesday night ’s friendly international with @entity24 at @entity25 , the former @entity27 and @entity28 boss admitted he never imagined a day when there would no @entity14 nor @entity21 clubs in the @entity2			1
fear : @entity1 is scared the @entity2 will be damaged by the absence of three of the nation 's largest club 's next season ‘ you have to say congratulations to @entity36			1
they deserve all the credit for getting promoted and getting the result they did after losing the first leg			2
so you ca n’t take anything away from them , ’ he said			2
‘ you ca n’t argue that they deserve to be there less than @entity15 or anybody else			2
they ’re there by merit			2
‘ but a league without @entity15 , @entity13 , @entity14 ? i could never have imagined that in my lifetime			1
‘ that ’s a real shame because they are among the bigger clubs in the country and they benefit the league by being in it			2
the league loses something by them not being it , for sure			0
’ @entity14 keeper @entity59 is the only player from @entity60 , @entity61 or @entity62 currently in the @entity9 squad who trained twice at @entity66 ’s training ground on monday			1
and @entity1 fears that ’s how it will remain until the three clubs can find a way back to health and start feeding the national team once more			1
‘ it should n’t impact in the sense that we ’ve got a squad here that we think we can do well with , ’ he said , ‘ but there ’s absolutely no doubt about it , @entity13 , @entity15 and @entity14 are clubs of a stature that should just about be able produce players - and have players in their team - that would be in the international squad			1
‘ and they have n’t at the moment			0
’ down and out : @entity89 players look dejected during their play - off penalty shootout heartache as @entity27 manager when @entity36 took barely 400 supporters to @entity96 derbies , the former @entity93 striker harbours concerns about the overall spectacle of the game without three of the clubs with the most signficant average home attendances			0
‘ i think it ’s huge			0
it ’s one of the things that frustrates me			0
we spoke about this when we used to go to these meetings at @entity109 when i was at @entity27 and @entity28			0
‘ we used to even ask why ca n’t they place the camera at @entity112 where you can see the crowd instead of the sea ? ‘ try and give a backdrop to @entity19 football			0
we used to talk about how teams like @entity112 could go to @entity119 and play brilliantly but the games weren ’ t shown because they were at home			0
‘ so it ’s all important , for the sake of the game , to promote it in a positive way			0
it does n’t always come across that way			0
‘ now , without the names of @entity15 , @entity13 and @entity14 in the division , i think it is lacking			1
