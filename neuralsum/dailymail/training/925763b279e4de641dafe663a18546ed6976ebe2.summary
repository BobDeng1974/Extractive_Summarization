prime minister @entity2 believes any club thinking of signing convicted rapist @entity4 must ' weigh the decision very carefully ' due to ' the position of footballers as role models ' , his spokesman has said			1
@entity10 , who are interesting in signing former @entity12 forward @entity4 , are currently weighing up a move for him			1
the club have stalled in completing a deal , however , due to the threat of two sponsors withdrawing their backing if the move was to go through			1
' ultimately , it is for employers to take decisions , but the prime minister does think that footballers are role models and he is sure that any potential would - be clubs and employers will weigh their decisions very carefully			1
' it appears that @entity24 , who owns @entity45 , could hold the key to whether or not @entity4 signs for the club			1
the @entity25 owner has come under pressure to withdraw his sponsorship of @entity10 and , if he does so or at least threatens to , the potential deal will almost certainly be dead in the water			1
@entity10 plan to hold more talks regarding the potential signing of @entity4 even though more than 30,000 people have signed a petition urging them not to do so			1

' after reading out the statement outside @entity66 , @entity88 refused to answer the questions of the 40 - plus media who had gathered to hear the club 's stance on the matter			0
@entity4 may have a proven record in @entity96 - in his final season at @entity12 he scored 35 goals in 42 appearances - but signing the player would prove to be a hugely contentious move for the @entity10 , who are 14th in the table			1
@entity4 was released from prison last october half way through a five - year sentence for raping a 19 - year - old woman			2
since then , he has been rejected by @entity108 and @entity109			0
former club @entity12 offered the striker a chance to train with them last november but they retracted the invitation after it caused uproar			0

' there are many professions that people can not return to after committing this sort of crime and football must be one of them , ' @entity157 added			0
@entity170 's police and crime commissioner @entity168 implored @entity10 to stay away from @entity4			1
' @entity4 is a convicted rapist and , whilst i strongly believe in the principle of rehabilitation , it will send out entirely the wrong message if they offer him a contract , ' he said			1
@entity10 stand to lose sponsorship revenue if they sign @entity4			2
@entity10 chief executive @entity74 reads out a club statement outside @entity66 on monday afternoon @entity181 , which sponsors a stand at @entity66 , says it would ' be out of the door ' if @entity10 went ahead with the signing			1

an @entity193 spokesman said : ' there is no clear consensus from fans one way or the other - this is clearly a very divisive issue in society , not just among supporters			0
' some fans argue that footballers convicted of offences such as rape should never be allowed to play professionally again as it is such a serious crime			0
' other supporters say that once an individual is released from prison , they should be allowed to pursue their previous career so long as the law of the land allows it			0
' even if @entity4 has the right to play , some fans say they would still feel uncomfortable at the implications of a convicted rapist representing their club			1
' @entity10 's secondary shirt sponsors @entity224 said the decision was solely down to the club			1
a statement said : ' as secondary shirt sponsors , we are obviously aware of on - going speculation concerning the possible engagement of @entity4 by @entity10			1
