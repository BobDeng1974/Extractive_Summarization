the last lap when i was with @entity41 it 's hard to race against such a good mate and play those tactics ( with him ) sitting on me for the whole of the last lap. ' once i tried my luck with the attacks and the climbs and he was still with me , i thought it was game over			2
' but i knew the sprint from 2009 when @entity53 beat me , i took it up really early and i knew that maybe with the last 200m downhill i stood a bit of a chance so i remained positive , gave it my best shot and when i was coming round to the line i could n't believe it , it felt surreal			0
