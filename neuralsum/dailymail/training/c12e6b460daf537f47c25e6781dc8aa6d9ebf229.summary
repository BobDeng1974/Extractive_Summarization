father of two @entity7 , 45 , suffered serious head injuries after slamming into the brickwork and was instantly knocked out in front of horrified spectators including dozens of children who had gathered to watch the event			1
@entity7 had been dressed as the ' @entity15 ' , an old woman who is part of the traditional end of @entity19 festivities and had offered to take part in the stunt which involved him hurtling down a zip wire suspended between the bell tower and a nearby building			1
footage taken at the scene and posted on the website of the local newspaper showed @entity7 's motionless body suspended and swinging from side to side , 20ft from the ground , as shocked onlookers screamed in horror before he was lowered down and given first aid			1
paramedics were quickly on the scene and he was rushed to the nearby @entity58 hospital where he underwent emergency surgery for a serious head injury and today doctors said he was in a ' serious condition ' and they could not rule out further surgery			1

' people were screaming and he was hanging there completely still , at first i thought he had been killed but the paramedics did a fantastic job and he was taken straight to hospital where he had an operation			0
' our thoughts and prayers are with his family and colleagues			0
it was not a particularly dangerous event and it has been taking place in the town for years but obviously after what happened everything was cancelled			0

the cause of what happened will be investigated but an initial examination of the scene looks like it was due to the brickwork giving way and unable to hold the mechanism down securely			2

we are also asking for people who filmed what happened to let us have their footage			0
