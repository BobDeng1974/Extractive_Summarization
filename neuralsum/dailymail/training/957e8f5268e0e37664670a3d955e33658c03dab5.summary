@entity0 has just been reminded of his role in a tv advert for @entity4 ’s chicken			1
it was the summer of 2011 and @entity7 ’s players were filmed eating platefuls of the stuff in the dressing - room at @entity11 to promote the club ’s new @entity13 owners			1
the final scene features captain @entity16 licking his fingers as he leads his team down the tunnel , as if this was a perfectly normal pre-match routine			2
mention of that last bit brings a burst of laughter from @entity0 , his @entity25 calm giving way to a fit of the giggles			1
@entity0 has started every @entity30 game for @entity31 this season the midfielder joined the @entity33 from @entity7 in 2012 following relegation to the championship ‘ when you think about it that ’s really weird , especially as we were n’t doing very well on the pitch , ’ says the @entity37 midfielder			1
‘ i do n’t get what that was all about			2
but you think , “ yeah they ’re new owners and they will do something amazing for the club ” so you just follow what they say			2
’ @entity4 ’s had arrived a few months earlier talking up the prospect of @entity54 football and of bringing stars like @entity56 to @entity57			1
instead , here were their players reduced to the role of @entity62			0
less than a year after that advert was shot , the team that @entity65 built had disintegrated and @entity7 had slipped out of the @entity30 under his successor @entity66			1
‘ it was really strange , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ i do n’t really get what happened , even now			0
‘ the first season there we finished 10th in the league with @entity65			2
the second season was n’t bad either			2
after that they changed everything – the owners , the manager , i do n’t even know why			0
so many players left and then it was a completely different club			1
the former @entity37 under 21 international scores with a header the season @entity7 fell out of the top flight @entity0 celebrates after scoring against @entity83 earlier this season @entity0 has been an ever - present for @entity31 in the @entity30 this season			1
in the last three years @entity0 has started more league games than any other midfielder			1
@entity0 - 94 @entity87 - 89 @entity88 - 88 @entity89 - 88 @entity90 - 85 ‘ just look at the players they brought in			1
obviously they were n’t @entity93 or @entity56 , like they said			0
what can you do ? that ’s football			0
but when players leave the club because they ’re not happy it ’s not easy			2
‘ when you see a player like @entity101 not playing anymore and @entity102 just disappear , obviously you know the team will fall apart			2
‘ i did n’t play the last four games			0
i got really mad in training and had an argument with the manager ( @entity66 )			0
‘ it ’s hard as a player when you see everything change and decisions are made that you do n’t expect so i got angry			0
after that i did n’t play and we were relegated			0
it was a really hard season			2
’ @entity0 left @entity7 after three years and joined @entity31 in a £ 3.5m deal that summer			1
he returns to @entity11 on saturday for the first time in a competitive fixture in the fifth round of the @entity121			1
the @entity31 midfielder is beaten to the ball by @entity124 in the recent defeat by @entity126 @entity0 flies into a tackle with @entity128 during his @entity7 days the nearest he ever got to playing with @entity56 was at @entity129 where he admired the @entity131 star and @entity132 from afar as a member of the club ’s youth academy			1
‘ that ’s when you realise “ why not me ? ” , ’ says @entity136			0
he was raised in the @entity140 suburb of @entity141 – also the birthplace of @entity126 ’s @entity143 – and grew up with his two sisters and brother			0
the 26 - year - old ’s father is from @entity147 , his mother ‘ 100 per cent @entity37 ’			1
@entity0 ’s performances for @entity150 earned the youngster a call - up to the @entity37 under - 21 national team which then brought him to the attention of @entity7			1
at 6ft 3in tall with a languid style and ability to attack and defend with great effect , comparisons have inevitably been made with @entity159			0
his old team @entity160 are not the only club to have cast admiring glances at @entity136			2
@entity0 admits he still harbours ambitions of play in the @entity54 @entity165 has made the midfielder a pivotal part of his @entity31 side in attack and defence ‘ i ’m tall , i play the same position and i ’m @entity37 so obviously you can make the comparison but i ’m not sure it ’s fair because it will be hard to match what he ’s done , ’ he says			1
@entity0 has started every @entity30 game for @entity31 this season and is a vital cog in the more expansive system implemented by @entity165 , being asked to get forward more often in addition to breaking up opposition attacks			1
it involves an incredible workload and at the halfway point of the season he had covered more ground – 134 miles in 19 games – than any other player in the top - flight			2
despite the laid - back demeanour , however , there remains an impetuous streak			0
@entity31 ’s coaching staff have had to tell @entity0 to keep his emotions in check on the pitch			1
off it , he has surprisingly ended both of his two seasons at the @entity203 by submitting a transfer request			0
‘ i do n’t regret that , ’ he says			0
‘ i had an issue behind the scenes , not about the football side			0
it was n’t fixed ( the first time ) but now it is so i ’m happy			0
@entity0 , pictured being sent off against @entity160 , has an impetuous streak that he struggles to keep in check @entity0 says he controls his temper much better now , but the red mist can still descend ‘ i ’m laid - back in life but on the pitch i can get really frustrated and emotional , there ’s a big difference			1
‘ i ’m really hard on myself , always have been			0
i do n’t like missing passes			0
i control it much better now but still sometimes i get frustrated really quickly			0
’ there is no disguising @entity136 ’s ambition to play at the highest level			0
he wants @entity54 football and has not abandoned hope of a senior call - up for @entity37 having turned down @entity147 on a couple of occasions			1
‘ when you ’re a kid you want to play in the @entity30 and then when you ’re here you look at the @entity54 and @entity231 , everybody wants that , ’ he says			1
‘ that ’s what makes you dream and go on every day			0
your career goes so quickly			0
i ’m 26 already , i was 21 at @entity7 so , of course , i would love to			2
