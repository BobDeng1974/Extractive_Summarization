a father spent £ 10,000 on private detectives after police failed to track down the thug who killed his daughter ’s kitten with an air rifle			1
@entity7 devoted six weeks to gathering information for a 15 - page report that named their prime suspect – but officers dismissed it as ‘ rumour and speculation ’ and abandoned the case			1
yesterday the millionaire former business owner – who posed as an angler at one stage to spy on youths he believed were responsible – criticised the police investigation as ‘ totally impotent ’			1
but police refused to bring a prosecution because of ‘ lack of evidence ’ for an attack that condemned @entity26 the kitten to a slow , agonising death			1
mr @entity7 ’s daughter @entity44 was horrified to find @entity26 lying in a pool of blood after limping home wounded and crippled with pain last september			1
the 24 - year - old medical student and her father took the kitten to a vet but she suffered ‘ a very long , painful , lingering death ’ from a ruptured bowel and blood poisoning , finally passing away on the operating table , mr @entity7 said			1
when police told him there was not enough evidence to pursue the case he hired the detective firm and offered a £ 1,000 reward to catch the killer			2
they distributed flyers and set up a phone line for people to give information			0
it quickly became clear there had been a string of air rifle attacks near where @entity44 lives in @entity73 , @entity74			2
‘ we narrowed it down to four youths , so we set about doing surveillance work , ’ mr @entity7 said			2
‘ we would camp out on the river pretending to be fishing			0
we surveyed certain areas by pretending to be members of the public			0
ideally we needed to witness an incident , but that never happened			0
we found a witness who claimed he had witnessed our main suspect shooting another cat			2
’ the kitten , pictured right with one of the family 's other pets , died despite extensive treatment at the vets mr @entity7 is offering £ 1,000 to anyone with information which could lead to @entity26 's killer			1
the kitten was shot near her owner 's home in @entity73 @entity73 - based @entity100 , whose staff includes ex-police officers , said the person responsible had ‘ an obvious sociopathic nature ’			1
mr @entity7 , 56 , added : ‘ we compiled all the information we had , and presented it to the police			2
we did 85 per cent of the work – then @entity74 and @entity110 would not even go and knock on a couple of doors			0
using an air rifle to shoot cats is illegal , and should be treated as such			0
’ mr @entity7 , who lives in a luxury house in @entity116 , @entity110 , said of the cost of his own investigation : ‘ i would pay double that if i thought it would stop this sort of behaviour			2
' i know i am in a fortunate position to be able to do so , but i think it is money well spent			0
it ’s about society fighting back			0
’ mr @entity7 enlisted the help of private investigators @entity130 ( offices pictured above ) to help find @entity26 's killer the animal is likely to have been playing in the garden when killed , mr @entity7 said			1
she returned to miss @entity137 's house wounded his daughter said : ‘ i feel like there is no justification for not investigating something that is illegal			1
we sympathise with the budget cuts – they have limited time and resources , which is why we chose to investigate it			0
but to still have the same response is very disappointing			0
’ @entity150 neighbourhood beat manager @entity149 said : ‘ we investigated this crime fully			0
as for the investigation report , i have examined this and it is packed with rumour and speculation , not evidence			1
‘ however , on the back of this , officers did make further inquiries in the area which also turned out to be fruitless			2
i am confident we have done everything possible in investigating this case			0
’ mr @entity7 said police were ' impotent ' in their investigations into who killed the cat , pictured above in a red collar mr @entity7 lives in a plush £ 3million home in @entity116 , @entity110 ( above )			1
his daughter is studying medicine in @entity73			0
