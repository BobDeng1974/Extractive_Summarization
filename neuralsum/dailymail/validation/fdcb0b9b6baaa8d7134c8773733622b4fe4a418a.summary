‘ there are very few moments in a man 's existence when he experiences so much ludicrous distress , ’ @entity0 wrote about having to chasing a hat in @entity2			1
but in the modern world , the same could easily be said about repeatedly forgetting an important password			0
now researchers have turned to the great @entity12 author to help find a way of making passwords both secure and more memorable			1
researchers have turned to the works of @entity0 ( illustrated ) to generate secure but memorable passwords according to new research by @entity20 - based computer scientists			1
they used a model from probability theory to examine the occurrence of letters within mr @entity0 ' @entity25 to generate new passwords they used a model from probability theory to examine the occurrence of letters within mr @entity0 ' @entity25 to generate new passwords			1
the process works by looking for two characters that commonly appear together but then generating a third letter that does not			0
millions of internet users still rely upon easy - to - crack passwords such as ‘ qwerty ’ and ‘ 123456 ’ , but many people are choosing to use more complex sets of characters for our online accounts			1
however , a new study has found these seemingly random passwords may be more obvious to hack than you realise			1
researchers have shown that passwords such as ‘ mnbvcxz ’ , ‘ qaz2wsx ’ and ‘ adgjmptw ’ can be cracked in seconds - and adding numbers to your codes does little to boost its strength			1
the analysis was made by hosting firm @entity57 using 10 million passwords recently released by security consultant @entity59			2
they spotted that a number of complex passwords were being used by multiple people			2
for example , ‘ qaz2wsx ’ was in the top 30			0
they also noticed that a website called @entity68 scored these words as zero , or low , for so - called entropy			2
entropy is used to determine the strength of a password in terms of ‘ information entropy ’			0
this comes from information theory and is measured in bits			2
the more bits a word is assigned , based on the number of guesses it would take to crack , the stronger the password			0
other words that received a low score include ‘ qwertyuiop ’ , ‘ 1qaz2wsx ’ and ‘ zxcvbnm ’			0
this is because each of these words follow a certain pattern on a keyboard , known as ‘ keyboard walks ’			0
the same approach is used to generate the third character using the second and third letter and so on			1
the result is 56 - bit passwords that look like @entity99 but are not , making them easy to remember but harder for hackers to guess			1
among the examples produced by the approach from the @entity25 were : ' the cusay is wither ? ' and ' @entity105 highly to a vice of eart '			2
this password would be entered as they are typed above , including spaces			0
according to dr @entity112 , a computer and software engineer at the @entity114 who devised the approach , these are easier to remember than random strings of letters and characters that are often recommended by password generators			1
he said : ' users are very bad at choosing passwords			2
' today , the general assumption - evidenced by the lack of systems using randomly assigned passwords - is that users can not be expected to recall secure passwords ' if we ’re convinced that random passwords are a good idea , and that recalling a 56 - bit password is at least within the realm of possibility , we must try to find a set of passwords that are as memorable as possible			1
' research on passwords has shown that most people tend to use letters or words that are easiest for them to remember			1
@entity59 , a @entity142 - based password researcher who recently published a list of 10 million passwords taken from those shared over the internet , found that the most commonly used password is 123456 followed by the word password			1
others tend to use their own name or use a password that is identical to their username			0
these are easy to break as most hackers will use easy to remember passwords when trying to break into an account			1
they will also tend to use real words when attempting to guess someones password			0
the graph above shows the distribution of letters following ' ca ' in @entity25 by @entity0			1
among the examples produced by the approach from the @entity25 include : ' the cusay is wither ? ' and ' @entity105 highly to a vice of eart '			2
these would be entered as they are typed , including spaces 1			0
trustno1 source : @entity59 online security experts recommend using a random string of letters , numbers and characters that use both upper and lower case letters			2
an eight - character password generated in this way can produce around 72 quadrillion possible variations - making it virtually impossible to guess			0
however , these are difficult to remember			0
dr @entity112 ' approach , which was highlighted by the magazine @entity196 , uses @entity198 models which are a way of generating random states based on states that currently exist			2
in the approach he took , two letters like ' ca ' may appear together in a piece of text , then the chance that they are followed by the letter ' r ' is 278/1397 for example			0
however the chance of those two letters being followed by the letter ' f ' or ' x ' is far less in that piece of text			0
by randomly generating letters using an algorthim that selects those letters based on meeting certain pobability rules of it appearing with the two preceeding letters in a piece of text , the method produces random but familiar looking passwords			1
dr @entity112 said that the approach is not just limited to the works of @entity0			1
indeed it could be used to generate passwords from a person 's own emails , for example			1
he said : ' naturally , the choice of @entity25 is largely arbitrary - any corpus of reasonable length will suffice			0
' one intriguing possibility would be to choose the full text of all of the e-mails in a particular user ’s history			0
' this text would presumably reflect the style of text that a particular user is accustomed to read and write , and should in principle be extraordinarily memorable			0

computer expert applied probability theory to @entity0 ' tale of two *cities*
they found the approach could generate random but familiar passwords
the 56 - bit passwords are secure but easier to remember , claim scientist
he said the approach could also be used to create passwords from emails
