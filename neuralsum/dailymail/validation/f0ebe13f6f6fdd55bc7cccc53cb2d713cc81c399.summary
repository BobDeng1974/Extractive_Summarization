@entity1 were all set to celebrate their 150th birthday and had their eye on a rather nice present - the @entity4			1
coasting at 2 - 0 with just a quarter - hour remaining here at @entity6 , @entity1 had their celebrations well underway			1
then , @entity8 decided to roll up , gatecrash and ruin everything			2
goals from @entity11 and @entity12 had the @entity14 side in complete control but @entity16 , who play a division below , forced extra time through @entity21 ’s penalty and @entity23 ’s late leveller			1
players of @entity8 celebrate after winning the @entity4 on penalties then , incredibly , they took the lead as @entity23 pounced again , only for @entity11 to send this magnificent advertisement for the non-league game to penalties			1
the first five spot - kicks were all scored , the next four saved and the four after that all scored			0
and so it was @entity1 ’s @entity33 , under the pressure of sudden death , who had to be the fall - guy			1
his penalty was kept out by @entity39 and so @entity16 were the ones who ascended the 107 steps to lift the handsome silver trophy			1
captain of @entity8 @entity21 lifts the trophy during the @entity46 @entity39 ( centre ) celebrates with @entity21 ( r ) and teammate @entity48 after saving a penalty to win it was , it ’s fair to say , the finest moment in their 81 - year existence , a moment nobody associated with the @entity57 club will ever forget			1
for @entity1 , the national stadium has become something of a second home			0
this was their third visit in as many years - in 2013 , they beat @entity64 in the @entity4 final before returning later in the same campaign for the conference play - offs final , losing to @entity68			1
@entity16 is a village on the north bank of the @entity71 , not too far from @entity72			0
it has a population of under 4,000 and most of them seemed to have decamped to @entity6 for the day			0
the place itself must have been eerily empty			0
players of both team prepare for extra time which ended up finishing 3 - 3 after the 30 minutes among those watching on was @entity83 chairman @entity82 , while @entity85 manager @entity84 had fixed it with his pal @entity87 for @entity16 to use @entity89 ’s training facilities on the eve of the game			1
the @entity92 , ninth in their league , had played under the @entity6 but not under the @entity95 it was 1997 when they last came to @entity6 , losing to @entity96 in the @entity98 final			0
the @entity14 side were backed by some 10,000 supporters and , as expected , they made the early running			1
it took just 11 minutes to make the breakthrough as @entity11 continued his marvellous run of goals in this season ’s trophy			2
@entity11 of @entity1 scores the first goal of the game as they took control early on in the final @entity11 ( centre ) celebrates with @entity114 after putting his side into the lead early on in the game he scored at @entity118 in the second round , two more in the replay , and in both legs of the semi-final with @entity123			1
in all , he has 16 goals this season and this was the most significant			0
@entity114 advanced down the left and exchanged passed with @entity128 before crossing low for @entity11 to finish from about eight yards			0
it was an accomplished finish , though the @entity16 defence allowed him ample time and space			2
@entity16 ’s best opening of the half came when a neat ball over the top sprung @entity136 who did well to hold off two defenders before forcing goalkeeper @entity138 into a block at his near post			2
@entity141 scores to make it 2 - 0 during the @entity46 but it was n't enough for @entity1 early in the second - half , there was encouragement for @entity16 when @entity147 , an international for @entity148 , shrugged off @entity33 and was only denied when @entity138 dived at his feet			1
a minute later and @entity128 should have found the net			0
set clear by a brilliant through ball , he rounded goalkeeper @entity152 only for @entity153 to clear his shot off the line			0
on the hour , @entity1 did claim their second			0
@entity12 , part of the team that won here two years ago , was played into acres of space on the right by @entity128 , raced clear and calmly slotted the ball past @entity39			1
king of @entity8 scores a penalty to make it 2 - 1 during the @entity46 @entity1 : @entity138 ; @entity33 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 ; @entity128 , @entity12 , @entity167 ( c ) ( @entity168 72 ) , @entity114 ( @entity169 102 ) , @entity170 ( @entity171 87 ) ; @entity11 substitutes not used : @entity172 , @entity173 scorers : @entity11 11 , 117 ; @entity12 60 booked : @entity138 @entity8 : @entity39 ; @entity175 , @entity153 , @entity176 , @entity177 ( @entity178 88 ) ; @entity179 ( @entity48 61 ) , @entity180 ( @entity23 79 ) ; @entity21 ; @entity114 , @entity181 , @entity182 substitutes not used : @entity183 ( gk ) ; @entity184 scorers : @entity21 ( penalty ) 75 ; @entity23 86 , 100 booked : @entity48 referee : @entity188 ( @entity189 ) attendance : 14,585 man of the match : @entity147 the goal showed how @entity16 had been stretched and @entity128 nearly capitalised on a carbon copy opening minutes later , only to drag his shot wide			1
@entity1 seemed to be cruising but things were back in the balance when @entity136 broke through the heart of the defence and was fouled as he tried to get round @entity138			2
@entity16 captain king assumed responsibility and hammered the spot - kick home to reinvigorate the match			2
after that it was all @entity16 and , with four minutes left , they drew level			0
@entity182 did well to retrieve the ball wide on the left and , cutting in from the byline , he delivered a low cross on a plate for substitute @entity23 to turn home			1
‘ you ’re not singing anymore , ’ sang those from @entity57			0
@entity23 is the equivalent of @entity1 ’s @entity11			1
this was his sixth in the @entity4 this season after earlier strikes against @entity218 , @entity219 ( twice ) , @entity220 and @entity221			0
@entity222 of @entity16 scores the teams third goal of the game in extra time a @entity6 @entity227 celebrates with his team - mates after equalising late at @entity6 for minnows @entity16 @entity21 ( @entity16 ) scored 1 - 0 @entity230 ( @entity1 ) scored 1 - 1 @entity48 ( @entity16 ) scored 2 - 1 @entity169 ( @entity1 ) scored 2 - 2 @entity23 ( @entity16 ) scored 3 - 2 @entity128 ( @entity1 ) saved 3 - 2 @entity147 ( @entity16 ) saved 3 - 2 @entity166 ( @entity1 ) saved 3 - 2 @entity231 ( @entity16 ) saved 3 - 2 @entity11 ( @entity1 ) scored 3 - 3 @entity176 ( @entity16 ) scored 4 - 3 @entity165 ( @entity1 ) scored 4 - 4 @entity178 ( @entity16 ) scored 5 - 4 @entity33 saved 5 - 4 all of a sudden , @entity1 were clinging on and @entity114 forced @entity138 into a fine save with a dipping shot from outside the box in stoppage time			1
@entity182 marauded again down the left , crossed and @entity23 tried to flick it in , only to be denied by @entity165 ’s desperate sliding block			0
coasting with 15 minutes left , @entity1 were somewhat fortunate to reach extra time			2
still @entity16 were the better side			2
@entity182 again accelerated into space down the right and was denied by @entity138			0
and guess who was the provider for @entity23 ’s second in minute 100			0
@entity147 ’s ball looped up off the boot of @entity33 and found its way to @entity23 for the simplest of close - range headers			2
cue delirium among those wearing green and white			0
@entity153 had saved @entity16 once and he did so again with a vital slide tackle when @entity169 pulled the trigger with 10 minutes left			0
the @entity92 were clinging on for dear life and their resistance was overcome just three minutes from time			0
a barrage was only half - cleared and it fell perfectly for @entity11 to thump home sweetly on the half - volley and ensure the drama of penalties			1
@entity166 watches as his penalty is saved by @entity39 during the @entity46 @entity147 watches as his penalty is saved during the match between @entity8 and @entity1 @entity39 saves the final penalty taken by @entity33 of @entity1 to win the final the @entity16 players run to their goalkeeper after he saved the penalty to win them the game			1

goalkeeper @entity39 was the hero as @entity16 came back from two goals down to beat @entity1 on penalties to win the @entity4
@entity272 and @entity12 goals had fired the @entity14 side into the lead
@entity21 scored a penalty to give @entity8 a *lifeline* before substitute @entity23 equalised late in normal time
@entity23 **'s** header made it 3 - 2 before @entity11 **'s** *stunning* strike set up penalties , which @entity16 *triumphed* 5 - 4
