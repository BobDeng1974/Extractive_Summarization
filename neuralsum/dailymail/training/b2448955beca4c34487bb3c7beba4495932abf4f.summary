' when we started @entity95 , we were just worried that it would affect the growth of the company , the sponsorships			0
' we both lived through @entity107 's horrors , of being gay and being in the public eye			2
and we both were afraid it would hurt the business			0
so we elected to be private about it			0
' like many gay people of their generation , both @entity1 and @entity69 felt uncomfortable about openly expressing their sexuality in public			1
' we never publicly said , " we 're gay			1
" we did n't like labels of any kind , but especially the ones referring to sexuality : queer , lesbian , homosexual , ' said @entity69			1
the couple were good friends with @entity140 , who was outed in 1981 , although the former tennis star tells @entity22 that @entity1 never asked what effect coming out had had on @entity140 's career			1
i thought it was weird , ' said @entity140			0
' selfishly i thought it would be great if @entity1 came out , and if @entity69 came out , but i knew they were n't there			2
i thought it would be great for an example of being gay and powerful and all the wonderful things , to be yourself and to be authentic			0

‘ but you could tell they were in love by the way they would touch each other when they 'd go by			0
