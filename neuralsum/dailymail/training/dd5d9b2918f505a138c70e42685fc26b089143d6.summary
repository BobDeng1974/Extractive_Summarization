by @entity0 @entity1 has released these stunning images of the @entity3 which show the biggest solar flare of the year			1
the huge eruption on april 11th caused a temporary radio blackout on @entity8 , officials say			1
however , they warn the worst is yet to come - with this year expected to see the sun reach its 11 year solar maximum			1
the huge eruption on april 11th caused a temporary radio blackout on @entity8 , and is the biggest of the year so far , officials say @entity1 's @entity12 captured this image of the flare			1
this image shows a combination of light in wavelengths of 131 and 171 angstroms			0
solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation			0
harmful radiation from a flare can not pass through @entity8 's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground , however -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where gps and communications signals travel			2
this disrupts the radio signals for as long as the flare is ongoing , anywhere from minutes to hours			0
the solar flare occurred at 3:16 a.m. edt ( 0716 gmt ) and registered as a @entity15 - class sun storm , a relatively mid-level flare on the scale of solar tempests			1
it coincided with an eruption of super-hot solar plasma known as a coronal mass ejection			0
' this is the strongest flare seen so far in 2013 , " @entity1 spokeswoman @entity49 explained in a statement			2
' increased numbers of flares are quite common at the moment , since the sun 's normal 11 - year cycle is ramping up toward solar maximum , which is expected in late 2013			1
' humans have tracked this solar cycle continuously since it was discovered , and it is normal for there to be many flares a day during the sun 's peak activity , @entity1 said			1
officials dubbed today 's solar flare as a ' spring fling ' for the sun , which has been relatively calm as it heads into its peak activity period			2
the @entity70 on the morning of april 11 , 2013 , was also associated with an @entity8 - directed coronal mass ejection ( @entity72 ) , another solar phenomenon that can send billions of tons of solar particles into space and can reach @entity8 one to three days later			2
the joint @entity78 / @entity1 @entity77 ( @entity77 ) captured this series of images of the coronal mass ejection ( @entity72 ) on the morning of april 11 , 2013 over the course of 3:48 edt to 4:36 edt			0
@entity83 can be seen on the left			0
cmes can affect electronic systems in satellites and on the ground			0
experimental @entity1 research models show that the @entity72 began at 3:36 a.m. edt on april 11 , leaving the sun at over 600 miles per second			0
the m - class solar flare was about 10 times weaker than @entity93 flares , which are the strongest flares the sun can unleash			1
@entity96 - class solar flares are the weakest solar events that can still trigger space weather effects near @entity8 , such as communications interruptions or spectacular northern lights displays			1
the solar flare triggered a short - lived radio communications blackout on @entity8 that registered as an @entity104 event ( on a scale of @entity106 to @entity107 ) , according to space weather scales			1
when aimed directly at @entity8 , major solar flares and coronal mass ejections can pose a threat to astronauts and satellites in orbit			2
they can interfere with gps navigation and communications satellite signals in space , as well as impair power systems infrastructure on @entity8			0
@entity77 also captured this coronagraphic ( a telescopic attachment designed to block out the direct light from a star so that nearby objects can be seen ) image of the @entity72 as it moves			0

flare caused temporary radio blackout on @entity8
classed as ' mid-level ' flare by @entity1
flares expected to increase as sun moves towards its solar maximum later this year
