the @entity2 @entity1 top 10 in @entity3 as shown by our live leaderboard it was one of @entity8 ’s stellar drives , the kind that lifts people off their seats to marvel at what sport at its best is all about			1
he was brave and relentless and skilled in a rain - splattered @entity2 @entity1 , seizing one of the finer of his 30 race victories by hunting down and passing his championship rival @entity17			1
but within minutes of the win , his face was sombre , his words grave , as he waited in the ante - room ahead of the podium ceremony			1
@entity17 had just whispered in his team - mate ’s ear the news that @entity26 of @entity27 had been seriously injured			1
although the seriousness of @entity26 ’s condition was not entirely known , the podium men — @entity8 , runner - up @entity17 and third - placed @entity32 of @entity33 — refrained from spraying the champagne			1
in the fading light of a drab , sodden day , even @entity8 ’s pyrotechnical driving had found sombre context			2
the whole benighted weekend had been beset by talk of the incoming weather — a super-typhoon called @entity42			0
would it tip an oceanful of water over the track at 3pm local time , the scheduled start of the race ? the rain was incessant but only pitter - pattering down all day			2
as the cars were driven from the garage to the grid only @entity50 slipped off the track ; the rest got round easily enough			2
as they waited to start , the rain markedly intensified			0
the teams prepared their cars under gazebos , turning the grid into a tented village			0
@entity61 glistened even in the gloom			0
rivulets ran across the track			0
fans in ponchos were soaked to the marrow			0
@entity8 recorded his third straight win after winning a rain - affected @entity2 @entity1 at @entity3 @entity26 was taken to hospital after crashing into a recovery vehicle that was removing @entity72 's stranded @entity71 @entity26 was taken to hospital in an ambulance after being left unconcious following his crash at @entity3 @entity26 's @entity27 crashed into the recovery vehicle that was removing @entity72 's stranded @entity71 1			1
@entity8 ( @entity77 ) - 266 2			2
@entity17 ( @entity77 ) - 256 3			2
@entity78 ( @entity33 ) - 196 4			2
@entity32 ( @entity33 ) - 136 5			2
@entity79 ( @entity80 ) - 133 so the race started behind the safety car			1
it was a reasonable decision but even at this stately pace , @entity85 ’s @entity84 slid off			0
@entity8 came on to the radio to ask the team to tell @entity17 not to stop suddenly , so poor was the visibility			1
perhaps rather cautiously , race director @entity90 called for a red flag after only two laps			2
there was a 20 - minute delay during which the @entity95 next to the track was the only wheel that turned			0
the race finally restarted , again behind the safety car			1
@entity8 was not keen on this artificial brake racing			2
in increasingly exasperated tones , he made it clear he thought conditions sufficiently good to take the safety car away			1
‘ @entity90 , the track is fine , ’ he said , addressing @entity103 directly			0
@entity8 ’s almost self - destructive blindness to danger is one of his finest traits as a sportsman			2
not everybody agreed with his gung - ho promptings			0
@entity112 of @entity113 complained animatedly that the conditions were unsafe			0
@entity90 waited a little longer before withdrawing the safety car			1
now @entity8 was a dog off his lead			2
ahead of him was @entity17 , who took pole position brilliantly in the dry on saturday but was now being harried every lap by the other @entity77			1
so it was no surprise when @entity8 passed him by coming out of the final chicane on lap 29 more cleanly , closing on his quarry on the straight and going round him on the outside of the first corner			1
it was clean , hard racing			0
there was no reprise of the @entity132 chicanery			0
‘ i was pushing to get by @entity17 , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ i had the @entity133 ( overtaking device ) open and i forgot to take it off			0
when i went into the corner the rear end stepped out			0
it was very , very close but i saved it			0
’ paramedics and marshals attend to @entity26 after his @entity27 crashed into a recovery vehicle towards the end of the race in @entity2 @entity72 , who spun off at the @entity142 , looks distressed as he talks to medical staff following @entity26 's crash @entity26 was rushed away in an ambulance and was unconscious after his crash with a recovery vehicle at @entity3 once he was ahead , he simply blitzed away to open up a 10 - point gap at the top of the world championship standings with four races remaining			1
he takes the momentum of three victories on the bounce into next sunday ’s inaugural @entity154 @entity1 , although the absurdity of double scoring at the final race in @entity158 renders his advantage less significant than it should be			1
the race was brought to a premature end when @entity26 slid off as he exited @entity142 , the long left - hander seventh corner , and hit the crane that was trying to lift @entity72 ’s @entity71 off the track			1
a safety car was deployed before the rising concern over his condition — and possibly the worsening light — caused the race to be brought to an end six laps early			1
the conditions were bad , but the typhoon stayed away			0
an honourable mention should go to @entity175 , the supreme tactician , who was first in for intermediate tyres after the restart and finished an impressive fifth for @entity179			0
it was a timely reminder of the @entity182 ’s ageless skills , with @entity79 linked with his seat if , as expected , the @entity184 leaves @entity80 to be replaced by @entity32 , who announced this weekend that he is moving from @entity33			1
however , @entity79 , it seems , may instead opt for a year out of the sport			0
his race ended after three laps with a suspected electrical failure			0
he was taken back to the garage on a scooter and threw his hands up in a resigned shrug			0
@entity194 claims dramatic @entity2 gp celebrations on the podium with the top three @entity8 ( second right ) , @entity17 ( left ) and @entity32 ( right ) were muted @entity8 ( right ) moved 10 points clear of @entity17 ( left ) in the drivers ' standings , but his celebrations were understandable low - key the @entity2 @entity1 started behind the safety car after heavy rain at @entity3 in the hours before the race heavy rain had threatened to wipe out the @entity2 @entity1 at @entity3 , but a full race was completed the safety car led the first 10 laps of the race before pitting and allowing @entity17 ( front ) and @entity8 ( rear ) to resume their title battle the torrential rain at @entity3 in the hours before the @entity2 @entity1 left the track flooded in places , as seen on the pit straight @entity8 ( right ) was on the tail of @entity17 ( left ) for the first half of the race and overtook him on lap 29 @entity32 came home third in his @entity33 ahead of team - mate @entity78 in fourth			1
