by @entity0 published : 14:15 est , 10 february 2014 @entity2 : 14:16 est , 10 february 2014 it was care fit for a king : the yellowing parchment was fitted inside a custom - designed aluminum and steel case with monitors , then wrapped in specially made packaging			0
once it was on the plane , a canon chancellor nervously tracked the flight as it crossed the @entity15			0
that document , a rarely seen copy of the @entity18 , had never before left @entity20 's shores and only once been outside its home in the @entity22 near the @entity24 border			1
now , the famous charter , written nearly 800 years ago and considered one of the most important documents in the history of democracy , is safely ensconced in the @entity30 , where it will be part of an exhibit that opens friday			1
monumental : one of four copies of the 1217 @entity18 has left @entity20 for the first time to travel to @entity35 , @entity36 where it will be part of an exhibit on the document and @entity40 life precursor : the famous charter was written nearly 800 years ago and is considered a major inspiration for the @entity43 ' a very historic flight for us , and the cathedral and the document , ' said @entity48 , chief executive of the @entity49 , who accompanied the document on its journey and is helping ensure it is properly cared for during its stay in @entity35			1
it will be on display for six months before being whisked back for a celebration of its 800th anniversary			2
the @entity18 was first issued on june 15 , 1215 , by @entity20 's @entity59 in @entity60			1
the document was designed to prevent civil war by granting rebellious barons certain freedoms , including three that are enshrined in @entity67 government : an acknowledgement that taxes can not be arbitrary , that free men can not be imprisoned without first being judged by their peers or the law and that justice can not be denied or delayed			2
home : the version of the @entity18 set for the exhibition in @entity35 is kept by @entity22 near the @entity24 border in @entity20 while scribes were hand - writing the @entity18 in @entity79 , the king sent sheriffs and constables advance notice — or a writ — telling them to expect new royal orders			1
at the time , there were probably dozens of copies of this writ , but the only known surviving one is owned by a chapter of the @entity91			2
that document , too , will be on display in @entity35			0
in the end , the @entity18 did n't prevent civil war under @entity59 because the pope nullified the charter shortly after it was issued			1
but two years later , after @entity59 died , his 9 - year - old son , @entity98 , reissued the charter			1
this 1217 document is the one visiting @entity35			0
the original folds from when it was delivered with two of the king 's seals are still apparent			2
the iron gall ink made from oak tree acid has turned from blue , to black to brown over the years , the tightly scripted dialect of @entity79 that few people understand today			0
yet the ideas live on			0
history : the original @entity18 was created under the reign of @entity59 of @entity113 ( left ) to quell a civil war			1
it was quickly repealed by the @entity115 , but brought back two years later by @entity59 's son @entity98 ( right ) ' your life and the country you live in and this thing that you call the @entity43 is influenced by this document , so this is a living document , ' said @entity123 , the museum 's curator of anthropology			1
preparations to bring the @entity18 to @entity35 have taken months , especially since the medieval document is only known to have left the cathedral 's stone walls once before			1
during @entity133 , the @entity18 , along with art from the @entity131 and other important documents , were put in ' deep storage ' in @entity135 , on the west coast of @entity24 , chosen with great secrecy to store @entity139 's treasures during the @entity141 attack on @entity142			1
in addition to the precautions taken during travel , caretakers of the @entity18 need to ensure it is not exposed to great amounts of light — especially ultraviolet rays — or humidity , explained @entity151 , director of the @entity152			2
fragile : @entity151 , director of @entity142 's @entity152 , inspects the @entity153 on february 5 , after it arrived in @entity35 for display after the document 's arrival in @entity35 on february 3 , @entity151 , @entity48 and museum curators spent hours calculating the level of ultraviolet rays , trying to get as close to zero as possible			2
a cavity underneath the case filled with silica gel — a chemical that helps regulate humidity — will prevent the parchment from wrinkling			0
museum curators will check a sensor inside the case to ensure conditions do n't change , and the room 's temperature will be no warmer than 71.6 degrees @entity171			0
a separate monitor will feed data to @entity151 ' computer to become part of the permanent record keeping			0
' i 'll check each day , ' @entity151 said , who will return to @entity20 after the exhibit opens			0
the museum , meanwhile , has prepared an exhibit designed primarily to convey to visitors — especially children — the document 's importance and what life was like in the @entity40			1
there will be swords , knights , intricate stained glass replicas from a cathedral in @entity192 and models of the various kings ' seals			0
' this is intrinsically important and interesting , ' @entity123 said .			0

the document signed by @entity59 in 1215 is a considered an inspiration for the @entity43
the original @entity18 was *initially* repealed but brought back by @entity59 's son @entity98 two years later
one of four surviving copies of @entity98 's document will go on exhibit at the @entity30 of @entity206
