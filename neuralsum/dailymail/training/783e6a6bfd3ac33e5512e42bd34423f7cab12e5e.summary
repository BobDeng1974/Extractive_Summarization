@entity7 has compiled a stark video incorporating clips from some of the worst examples of homophobic violence in @entity1 which has been filmed and uploaded to the internet			1

victims : @entity22 campaigners stand in a huddle as they are photographed after being beaten by homophobic gangs during a protest , in a grab taken from a video of clips compiled by @entity7 a man yanks on the bag held by one of the gay activists during the protest , in scenes increasingly common in @entity1 the country has faced fierce criticism over the climate of fear endured by @entity1 gays ahead of the @entity40 , with opposition focused around a new law banning the dissemination of ' gay propaganda ' to children			1
' the @entity1 authorities have the power to protect the rights of @entity22 people , but instead they are ignoring their responsibility to do so , ' said @entity51 , @entity1 researcher at @entity7			1
' by turning a blind eye to hateful homophobic rhetoric and violence , @entity1 authorities are sending a dangerous message as the world is about to arrive on its doorstep for the @entity59 that there is nothing wrong with attacks on gay people			1
' victims in cities including @entity66 , @entity67 , and @entity68 told researchers from @entity7 they were attacked in public places , abducted , beaten , harassed , threatened , and psychologically abused			1
they told the campaign group that they were afraid to go to the police to report violence , fearing further harassment and believing the police would not bother to pursue their attackers			0

a gang filmed beating a lone gay man in a video uploaded to and distributed on a @entity1 social network @entity7 hopes to pressure the @entity1 government into action over violent homophobia by inciting international opprobrium ahead of the @entity18 in @entity19 , which begins on friday there has been a disturbing rise in the publication of videos on social networks showing self - described vigilantes dishing out punishment beatings and humiliations to gay people			1
starting in late 2012 , numerous groups mainly consisting of radical nationalists began attacking and harassing gay people in dozens of @entity1 cities			2
mostly claiming to be fighting pedophilia , these groups lure men and boys to meet , accuse them of being gay , humiliate and beat them , and post videos of the proceedings on social networks , intentionally exposing their victims to further abuse			0
these groups have posted hundreds of the sickening videos online , often barely bothering to hide their identities because of the apparent impunity in which they are able to operate			0
impunity : many of the ultra-nationalist gangs are so unafraid of any action being taken by the authorities that they make no attempt to disguise their identities in the videos which they upload to the internet when victims of homophobia did lodge complaints with the police , few investigations followed , it is claimed the adoption of the federal law banning ' propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations among minors ' is but one measure among several federal @entity138 laws proposed or adopted in the past year in @entity1			1
violating the law is an administrative offense punishable by a range of fines			0
media and organizations face particularly hefty fines , while foreigners who violate the law are subject to fines , up to 15 days in detention and deportation			0
the law also bans representing ' traditional ' and ' nontraditional ' relationships as equally acceptable			0
that makes it illegal to say anything positive about being gay publicly or to tell a child that there is nothing wrong with being gay or being raised by gay parents			0
at the same time , @entity7 reports , a vicious homophobic campaign began in the media , particularly state - sponsored and state - controlled media outlets			2
the group 's research found that government officials , journalists , and celebrities have publicly called @entity22 people ' perverts ' , ' sodomites ' , and ' abnormal ' , and have conflated homosexuality with pedophilia			0
climate of fear : the attacks come as several anti-homosexual laws have been passed in @entity1 's parliament horrific : the ferocity of the violence seen in some of the clips in @entity7 's compilation is shocking left for dead : @entity7 has warned the @entity1 government that it must get a grip on the problem miss @entity51 said : ' the discriminatory impact of the @entity138 law and hateful language on state television have created a climate of intolerance against the @entity1 lgbt community			1
' @entity1 leaders should denounce , not feed , homophobic hysteria , or the @entity196 â€™s silence will be taken as condoning the violence			2
' she added : ' @entity1 officials have long denied that discrimination against @entity22 people exists , including to the @entity202 , yet the hostility and violence clearly have been intensifying			2
' as @entity1 hosts the @entity59 in this atmosphere of homophobic hatred , the government needs to take urgent measures to support the rights of @entity22 people and protect them			2
