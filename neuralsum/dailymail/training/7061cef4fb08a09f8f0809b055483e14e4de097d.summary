by @entity0 he 's tasked with sampling the calorie - laden culinary delights on @entity3 week after week so really it should come as no surprise that @entity6 might gain a few pounds here or there			1
however , it seems that 48 - year - old @entity6 has enjoyed a few too many taste tests over his time on the show , revealing that he thinks he 'll have piled on a staggering stone by the end of the season			1
speaking on this morning about the tenth series final , which will see cooks @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 battle it out for the title tonight and tomorrow , he said : ' i watch it now and think " i know that , at the end of the series , i 'll be a stone heavier			1
' piling on the pounds : masterchef judge @entity6 revealed on this morning that he puts on a stone by the end of the series ' i saw myself on tv the other day and i 've got this big fat belly in my chef 's outfit and thought " @entity35 , you 're unattractive " , ' he added			1
his perceived weight gain is hardly surprising considering how much food he is tasked with sampling			1
when asked how many plates of food he 's eaten over the ten series , he replied : ' i reckon it 's close to 10,000 because there was one series we did when we actually ate 2,490 plates of food in one series			1
' and whn quizzed on how he attempts to keep the weight off , he told @entity50 that he ' cycles like hell '			1
it has n't stopped him ! despite his complaints about his weight gain , @entity6 tucked into some culinary delights on the show he works out : @entity6 told @entity50 and @entity58 that he keeps the weight off by ' cycling like hell ' - he even arrived at the @entity63 studios on his bike anyone who is a fan of @entity3 might have noticed that @entity6 's weight does seem to fluctuate a tad			1
since 1999 , when the show first began @entity6 has obviously got a little older and wiser and his body shape has changed here and there too			2
how he is today : @entity6 , 48 , says that he looks at himself at the end of a series and realises he has gained a stone creeping on ? @entity6 , pictured , left , in 2012 and , right , in 2011 , says he recently saw himself on tv and thought ' @entity35 , you 're unattractive ' that 's a lot of taste tastes : when asked how many plates of food he 's eaten over the ten series , @entity6 , pictured , left , in 2010 and , right , in 2009 , replied : ' i reckon it 's close to 10,000 ' foodie feast : @entity6 , pictured , left , in 2008 and , right , in 2007 , reveals that there was one series we did when he and @entity87 ate 2,490 plates of food in one serie back in the day : @entity6 , pictured , left , in 2006 and , right , back in 1999 , is the star of a new show that will see him revisit childhood haunts in @entity93 , along with the people and places that influenced his cooking and inspired him to become a professional chef meanwhile , co-star @entity99 , who once described himself as the ‘ fat , bald bloke on @entity3 who likes pudding ’ , has lost two stone on his latest diet and become an ambassador for @entity105 as a result			1
super slimmer : meanwhile , co-star @entity99 , pictured , left , now , and right , two years ago , has lost two stone on his latest diet and become an ambassador for @entity105 as a result and perhaps it 's not just @entity6 's judging duties that have lead to @entity6 's extra pounds			2
they say that being in a relationship leads to weight gain , so maybe @entity6 's girlfriend actress and chef @entity115 is partly to blame ? @entity115 has described her relationship with @entity6 , which blossomed after the pair pair met on celebrity masterchef in 2010 and split from their former partners , as ' really new , really lovely '			2
