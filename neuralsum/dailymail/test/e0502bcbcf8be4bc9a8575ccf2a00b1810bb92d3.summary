the number of hayfever sufferers in the @entity2 is predicted to reach 20 million this summer , up a third from last year as warm weather bathes the country			1
for many , the glorious sunshine and promise of temperatures warmer than the @entity8 this week will come as a welcome relief			2
but for millions , the first tentative steps towards summer brings impending misery as a dreaded cloud of invisible pollen descends			0
experts told @entity15 that five million people are expected to fall victim to the symptoms - which include streaming eyes , incessant sneezing and irritating itches at the back of the throat - for the first time			1
around 20 million people in the @entity2 are expected to suffer hayfever symptoms this summer , up a third from last year , experts told @entity15 and by 2030 that figure is expected to surge to 31.8 million sufferers			1
dr @entity30 , a leading pollen expert , told @entity15 that a 33 per cent rise in the number of people struck by hayfever this year could occur , ' depending on weather conditions '			1
she said : ' if we get prolonged periods of warm , dry weather with intervals of some wet weather between , which helps the grass to keep growing , we will experience a lot of high grass pollen counts			1
' grass is the main culprit pollen for hayfever in the @entity2			2
' high and very high pollen counts can trigger hayfever symptoms in people who have not had them before			1
she added : ' in addition , the good weather typically brings increases in air pollution , which can make symptoms worse , and again lead them to occur in people who have been symptom free before			1
' in addition , she said pollen is becoming more potent , and greater numbers of plants giving off the allergens is also contributing to a rising number of sufferers			1
dr @entity30 said another contributing factor is that the average hayfever season is becoming longer , typically stretching from april to the end of august			0
she added : ' there is substantial evidence from pollen monitoring records and from vegetation surveys to show that the timing of some of the pollen seasons has been changing in the @entity2 and across @entity76 over the last few decades			0
hayfever seasons in the @entity2 are becoming longer , as warmer weather in spring and autumn means pollen is typically rife from march to the end of august ' in addition there has been a trend to longer pollen seasons and increasing pollen loads of some types			1
' globally , average surface temperatures have increased by about 0.7 ° c over the past 100 years , leading to earlier plant growth in many regions			0
' the trend towards warming has been more pronounced in winter months , resulting in more changes in the timing of spring pollen seasons than those of summer and autumn			0
' hayfever is an allergic reaction to pollen and spores			2
it happens when the immune system mistakes these harmless airborne particles to be a danger and launches a defence against them			0
the body produces an antibody and histamine is released which causes the typical symptoms of sneezing , runny nose and eyes , an itching nose and mouth , and possibly a blocked nose			0
the allergy is a seasonal one , triggered by a range of different pollens ranging from tree to grass , weeds to fungal spores			0
by 2030 , dr @entity30 predicts there will be 31.8 million sufferers as the situation will worsen			1
' as summers become warmer more photochemical smogs will occur on dry days resulting in an increased frequency of days with high concentrations of ozone , @entity132 and other pollutants that will make symptoms worse , and that will make people more susceptible to allergens , ' she said			1
' due to climate change in the future , plant growth may be influenced in a way that more , new and altered pollens are produced , which may affect humans			0
' dr @entity30 , speaking on behalf of @entity144 , warned the season is expected to start suddenly with pollen counts surging from almost nothing to very high in a matter of days			1
friday is set to be the hottest day of the year so far , with the mercury poised to rise steadily to reach 21 ° c in parts of southern @entity152			2
in preparation , hayfever sufferers are being encouraged to take action , stocking up on antihistamines and other treatments to lessen the impact of their symptoms			2
' it is very important to know the seasons , when it is likely to peak and the days when pollen levels will be particularly high			2
' knowing when the season is about to start means there is lots a person can do			0
' if you are not sure of the best treatment you can speak to your pharmacist or gp			0
' steroids are often used to treat hayfever , but they are best taken before the onset of symptoms			2
dr @entity30 said : high and very high pollen ( pictured under the microscope ) counts can trigger hayfever symptoms in people who have not had them before ' ' antihistamines are also commonly used and it is a good idea to get them in and ready to use when the season starts			1
' if you have got a big event , like exams or a wedding coming up you can ask your gp to prescribe a short course of steroid tablets to keep symptoms at bay			0
' there are lots of options available , the key is just to be organised and ensure you are prepared			0
' on days you know the pollen count is high make sure you take antihistamines before you leave the house , and wear sunglasses to keep pollen out of your eyes			2
' make sure you wash your clothes regularly and do n't sleep with the window open			0
' dr @entity30 said pollen counts can suddenly surge if conditions are right			1
' a warm day with a slight breeze can signal the perfect conditions for spores to infest the air , causing pollen levels to surge , ' she warned .			0

last year 15 million people fell victim to the symptoms of hayfever
this year that number is expected to rise by a third to 20 million
experts told @entity15 warmer weather can result in very high pollen counts which trigger symptoms in new sufferers
high temperatures also increase air pollution , which worsen symptoms
