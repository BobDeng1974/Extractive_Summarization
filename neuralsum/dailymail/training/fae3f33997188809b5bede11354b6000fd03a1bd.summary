@entity3 , 49 , had a gun pointed at her during the raid which took place in @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18			1
the mother - of - two who has run the office for 13 years was left so traumatised by the incident she closed its doors for 48 hours			1
but impatient local customers lodged formal complaints with the @entity26 because they were n't able to collect parcels during the two days			1
the claims were investigated but have since been dismissed			1
mrs @entity3 was shocked to discover villagers had reported the office 's closure as most local residents sent her flowers and messages of support following the incident november 5			1
after reopening , she placed a notice in the office 's window which read : ' thanks you to all friends and customers for your patience and kind wishes during our terrible ordeal			2
' if the two people who made a complaint to customer services about not being able to collect their parcels whilst we were closed would like to make yourselves known we will explain the severity of the ordeal personally			1
' the 49 - year - old claims the people who lodged complaints would have known why the branch was closed as in such a small village , ' everyone knows what has happened '			1
' after the initial anger i just felt sorry for them because they obviously have nothing better to do			0
but there is no chance they will apologise now out of embarrassment , ' she said			0
robbers carrying an axe and a gun attempted to rob the @entity26 earlier this month while ms @entity3 was working ' if my customers find out who it is i ’m sure they ’ll let them know about it			1
' if there were stocks in the village they would put them on that			0
' but i think the people that have complained have probably suffered enough because everyone has been talking about it			0
it ’s like @entity90 whispers in a village like this			0
' mrs @entity3 had a gun pointed in her face when the robbers arrived at the post office by motorbike at around four o'clock			1
' it was quiet in the office at the time , then two men barged through the door demanding cash			0
' ' one was holding a hand gun and one an axe			1
' one held out the gun at my colleague and i. the other man , with the axe , was blocking the door to prevent entry			1
in effect we felt like hostages			0
' ' the ordeal was terrifying - it lasted about three minutes but , in truth , it it felt like ten minutes			0
it was if it was happening in slow motion			0
' a ' guardian angel ' customer who tried to enter the branch at the time of the attempted robbery notified police who rushed to the scene in @entity16 , @entity17 mrs @entity3 recalls how the men fled when a customer realised what was happening and phoned police			1
the ' guardian angel ' tried to enter the post office but was blocked entry			0
after spotting the motorbike , she looked through the window to see the men yielding an axe and phoned for help			2
speaking of the two people who lodged complains , one local resident said : ' i think maybe they did n’t realise what had happened			2
' if they did then it ’s really sad			0
it ’s an awful thing to do to @entity3 because she ’s brilliant			2
after learning that two customers lodged complaints against her for closing the branch , the postmistress invited them to get in touch “ she litterpicks around here and does lots for the community			1
she even paints phone boxes and that ’s in her spare time because this post office is used constantly			0
' these ridiculous complaints are all we need because after all that ’s happened because the robbery was really worrying for the people who live around here			0
' parish councillor @entity163 said : ' the post office is the centre of the community and we are more interested in the real victims , @entity3 and her team , not someone who has not been able to collect a parcel			1
' @entity3 is an integral part of the village and a marvellous asset			2
we are all pleased she is operating her business again , something for which we should be grateful			0
' one of the finest traits of the @entity179 people is the depth of their compassion and their selfless support for each other through difficult times			0
' i know @entity3 will have seen this herself over recent weeks			2
i want her to know and remember , the people of @entity16 support her 100 per cent			0
' a @entity26 spokesman said : ' any robbery is traumatic for victims and we will be supporting police in their efforts to apprehend those responsible			2
