by @entity0 published : 10:41 est , 21 january 2014 updated : 11:28 est , 21 january 2014 the commissioner also said that @entity3 could be linked to the increase there was a sharp leap in domestic violence in the last quarter of 2013 - with a rise of 15.5 per cent of victims suffering abuse at home , police have revealed			1
speaking to a panel including mayor @entity15 at @entity16 in @entity17 today , metropolitan police commissioner sir @entity13 said that there had been a 5.1 per cent rise in the final quarter of last year of attacks with injuries , compared with the previous three months			1
he said he believes this was mainly driven by a 15.5 per cent increase in domestic violence			1
sir @entity13 said : ' it may be down to increased reporting rather than down to more domestic violence			1
' some of these increases have been in boroughs which have made the most increases to third - party reporting ( where someone other than the victim reports the crime )			0
' we are not going to say it 's something we are not concerned about , but it 's too early to say it 's a trend			0
' the number of repeat domestic violence victims fell by 10.2 per cent in the three months , suggesting that more new victims came forward in that time			1
the commissioner also said that @entity3 could be linked to the increase , saying : ' you can imagine that when people are at home more there is more opportunity for domestic situations			2
' violence with injury as a whole had risen by 5.4 per cent compared with the same quarter in 2012			1
@entity54 , chief executive of domestic violence charity refuge , said : ' domestic violence thrives on secrecy , so no one knows its true extent			1
refuge works with women and children in a number of @entity17 boroughs and we know that many of them live in fear before finding the courage to ask for help			0
a huge leap in domestic violence has pushed violent injuries up by five per cent , police have suggested ' but these figures show that more women in @entity17 are coming forward and reporting domestic violence to the police			1
this is a good thing			0
' domestic violence is a serious crime that kills two women a week in @entity83 and @entity84			2
through rigorous arresting and charging we can protect women and children by holding violent men accountable for these atrocious crimes			0
' but she said the charity receives fewer visits to its website and that there are fewer calls to the @entity97 at @entity3 than at other times of year			0
' it can be very difficult for a woman experiencing domestic violence to access support during the festive period - a period when her abusive partner may be spending more time at home and monitoring her behaviour more closely than ever , ' ms @entity54 said			1
separately , questions were also raised over why crime in @entity17 is not falling as quickly as in the rest of the country			0
in the decade to 2013 crime in the capital dropped 27 per cent , compared to 38 per cent across @entity83 and @entity84 and 50 per cent in urban areas classed as being similar to @entity17			0
chair of the @entity117 and @entity118 , @entity115 said : ' we are all pleased that crime has fallen by more than a quarter in @entity17 over the last 10 years			0
' but , as we probed the @entity122 's budget for next year , we found that crime has been falling much faster in the rest of the country and nobody seems to know why			0
' the mayor has a responsibility to make decisions on @entity17 's £ 17.5 billion budget based on evidence , and he needs more data to understand why the @entity122 's performance lags behind that of forces in other parts of the country			0
' there are no reliable national data on the general incidence of domestic violence in the @entity140 , but women 's aid have collected figures which show the worrying extent of domestic violence in the country			2
in 2011/12 , 7.3 per cent of women ( 1.2 million ) and 5 per cent of men ( 800,000 ) report having experienced domestic abuse			2
31 per cent women and 18 per cent of men have experienced domestic abuse since the age of 16 years			0
this amounts to 5 million women and 2.9 million men			0
domestic violence has repeatedly been identified as a major factor leading to death in or related to pregnancy and childbirth			2
in 2011/12 , the police reported nearly 800,000 incidents of domestic violence			2
domestic violence accounts for 10 per cent of emergency calls			1
domestic violence has consistently accounted for between 16 % and one quarter of all recorded violent crime			1
there has been a 65 per cent increase in number of domestic violence prosecutions between 2005/6 and 2010/11 and a corresponding 99 per cent increase in number of defendents convicted			1
despite this , domestic violence conviction rates in the five years to 2011 stood at just 6.5 per cent of incidents reported to police – though a much higher proportion of around 70 per cent of those charged			1
women are much more likely than men to be the victim of multiple incidents of abuse , of different types of domestic abuse ( partner abuse , family abuse , sexual assault and stalking ) and in particular of sexual violence .			0
