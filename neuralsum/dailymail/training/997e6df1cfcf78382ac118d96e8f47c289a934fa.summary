by @entity0 and @entity1 civil war erupted in the @entity3 last night after @entity4 accused @entity5 of lying about urging him to make a @entity7 comeback			1
supporters of the @entity10 mayor claimed the chancellor ’s camp was engaging in a ‘ dirty tricks plot ’ to wreck his hopes of becoming @entity3 leader – and boost mr @entity5 ’s own ambitions for the job the simmering ‘ @entity4 versus @entity5 ’ leadership feud burst into the open over reports that mr @entity5 had ‘ delivered personally ’ a message to mr @entity4 that @entity21 wants him to stand as a parliamentary candidate at the next election			1
future potential leadership rivals @entity5 , left , and @entity4 together in @entity25 last year the aim was said to be to force mr @entity4 to prove his loyalty by ‘ pinning his political fate to that of the prime minister ’			2
but it sparked a fierce backlash from mr @entity4			0
a well - placed source says that , when he was told mr @entity5 had approached him about the matter , the mayor exclaimed : ‘ bull * * * * ! there has been no such conversation			0
they are trying to tie me in			0
’ mr @entity4 believes the manoeuvre is a ploy to ensure he gets equal blame if the @entity43 lose power , and make it easier for mr @entity5 to beat him in a subsequent race to succeed mr @entity21			1
there is a growing rift between the two men , now seen as the main candidates in the race to succeed mr @entity21 in the event of a @entity3 flop at the next election			1
and the row is set to intensify as mr @entity4 will address conservative election candidates at a reception in the @entity7 tomorrow			2
mr @entity4 has made no secret of his desire to return to the @entity7 , but the timing of his return is seen as a crucial factor in determining whether he can win the @entity3 crown			1
mr @entity4 believes the manoeuvre is a ploy to tie his fortunes to @entity21 at the next election , complicating his leadership bid the mayor fears that if he stands at the next election – or even before by contesting a by - election – and the @entity3 lose , he will be ‘ tainted ’ , along with all others involved in the campaign			1
instead , he intended to wait until after the election and make a quick commons return in a by - election – in time to throw his hat into the ring if mr @entity21 steps down			2
until recently , mr @entity4 was seen as frontrunner in the conservative leadership stakes			1
but mr @entity5 ’s success with the economy has changed that and he is now seen as a serious contender			0
@entity3 mps say arch political tactician mr @entity5 has built up a formidable covert leadership team , including potential leadership running mate @entity84 , the @entity85			2
he could rely on support from close friend mr @entity21 , who has always regarded fellow @entity87 mr @entity4 with suspicion			1
mr @entity4 ’s allies say high - flying business minister @entity89 , a protégé of mr @entity5 , is a key figure in behind - the - scenes plotting – but he denies it			0
an ally of the mayor said : ‘ this is nothing to do with party loyalty and everything to do with @entity5 and @entity21 trying to destabilise @entity4			1
‘ he saw it coming a mile off			0
they want to make sure that if the @entity43 lose , @entity4 gets as much flak as they do and ca n’t stand as leader as a “ break with the failed @entity102 regime ”			1
‘ @entity4 can play a full part in the election campaign regardless of whether he stands in the @entity105			2
this is a clumsy attempt to con him into doing it , with inevitable claims that he ca n’t wait for @entity21 to fail , or falsely accuse him of disloyalty if he does n’t stand			2
’ one of @entity4 ’s admirers said : ‘ if the @entity3 lose the election , the @entity3 faithful will be begging @entity4 to come back as their saviour and he will be unbeatable			1
that is what worries @entity5			0
’ another mp close to mr @entity4 claimed the @entity5 - @entity84 camp were trying to trick mr @entity4 into leading the @entity3 campaign against @entity119 ’s @entity118 ‘ because they know it would lose @entity4 votes in any @entity3 leadership contest			1
@entity4 is n’t daft ’			0
allies of mr @entity5 denied the chancellor was plotting against mr @entity4			2
‘ there is nothing in this , ’ said one			0
‘ the prime minister has already said he wants @entity4 to be an mp			0
’ an mp close to mr @entity4 claimed rivals were trying to trick mr @entity4 into leading the @entity3 campaign against @entity119 's @entity118 because they know it would cost him popularity among eurosceptics mr @entity4 ’s friends say he has yet to decide when he will return to the @entity7			1
his term as @entity10 mayor runs until 2016 but , theoretically , there is nothing to stop him serving as mayor and an mp simultaneously , as his @entity143 predecessor @entity142 did for part of his two terms as mayor			0
there is no doubt that the @entity4 charm offensive has already started			0
returns to @entity7 after 2015 election advantage : he stays above the fray if @entity43 lose – and bides his time if @entity21 triumphs			1
danger : if @entity21 quits , @entity4 must find a seat fast to enter the leadership race			1
returns to @entity7 at 2015 election advantage : perfectly placed to throw his hat into the ring if @entity21 flops			2
danger : if @entity43 lose , he is linked to the flop and ‘ tainted ’			0
if @entity21 triumphs , @entity4 is stuck on the @entity7 sidelines			1
returns to @entity7 before 2015 election advantage : if @entity3 ratings fall and panicking mps sack @entity21 , @entity4 can become pm			1
danger : claims he had returned early to wield the knife would damage him			0
at tomorrow night ’s ‘ @entity174 ’ he will have a chance to win over many of those set to become mps after the 2015 election			0
but one of those invited said : ‘ it ’s a bit confusing for us , because we see him as a potential rival for some of the best seats			0
’ the growing rivalry between mr @entity4 and mr @entity5 has led to the creation of two gangs of rival @entity178 , the ‘ @entity190 ’ ( @entity188 ) and the ‘ @entity195 ’ ( @entity196 ) , including deputy chief whip @entity191 and @entity3 mps @entity192 and @entity194			1
fogs make risqué jokes about mr @entity4 ’s bumbling image and messy private life ; @entity188 counter by gossiping about why the chancellor has adopted a new haircut – and whether the colour is natural			2
one @entity204 sarcastically complained : ‘ @entity5 is trying to make sure the proceeds of growth go straight into his leadership account ’			0
the @entity209 rivalry spilled over last autumn when both men travelled to @entity25 at the same time , and @entity4 ’s team accused @entity5 of trying to cut him out of key events			0
@entity213 , one of the few @entity3 mps to publicly back @entity4 , has likened him to a famous beer advert , saying , ‘ @entity4 is our @entity216			1
he reaches parts of the electorate other politicians fail to reach			0
’ she added that any leadership contest would be ‘ inconceivable ’ without mr @entity4 .			0

@entity223 has been seen as frontrunner in @entity3 leadership stakes
@entity4 's supporters say chancellor 's camp engaged in ' dirty tricks plot '
move to ask @entity4 to stand seen as ploy to tie his fortunes to @entity21
he will then get equal blame if the @entity43 are thrown out at the election
