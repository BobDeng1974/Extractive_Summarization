pope @entity0 may be looking forward to a well - earned retirement this week , but there is at least one thing he will surely miss about his current office - his flashy red shoes			1
new details of how he will be treated after his retirement on thursday emerged today , as it was revealed he will take the title of ' emeritus pope ' and will continue to be called ' his holiness '			2
although @entity0 will no longer be allowed to wear the red leather shoes that are one of the most recognisable papal symbols , he will continue to wear the white robes which are associated with the @entity0			1
@entity17 dresser : pope @entity0 wearing his traditional red shoes while meeting then archbishop of canterbury @entity19 during his visit to @entity22 in 2010 losing out : his holiness will no longer don his trademark footwear after he retires on thursday the pope 's title and what he would wear have been a major source of speculation ever since @entity0 stunned the world and announced he would resign on thursday , the first pontiff to do so in 600 years			1
reverend @entity32 , a @entity33 spokesman , said @entity0 himself had made the decision in consultation with others , settling on ' your holiness @entity0 ' and either ' emeritus pope ' or ' emeritus roman pontiff '			1
in the two weeks since @entity0 's resignation announcement , @entity33 officials had suggested that @entity0 would resume wearing the traditional black garb of a cleric and would use the title ' emeritus bishop of @entity46 ' so as to not create confusion with the future pope			1
@entity0 's decision to call himself emeritus pope and to keep wearing white will fan concern voiced privately by some cardinals about the awkward reality of having two popes living within the @entity33 walls			1
adding to the concern is the fact that @entity0 's trusted secretary , monsignor @entity57 , will be serving both pontiffs - living with @entity0 at a monastery inside the @entity33 and working in the new @entity0 's household			1
stepping down : @entity0 leading sunday prayers for the last time before leaving his office @entity0 has made it clear he is retiring to a lifetime of prayer and meditation ' hidden from the world '			2
pope @entity68 is a title that has been coined to cover the near - unprecedented presence of a retired @entity0			2
the word ' emeritus ' enables someone of status such as a professor who has handed over their position to retain their former rank in their title			0
the @entity0 has two days left before he takes the historic step of becoming the first pontiff in six centuries to step down instead of ruling for life			2
he will be known as ' pope emeritus @entity85 ' or ' @entity86 emeritus @entity85 ' , be addressed as ' @entity0 ' , and be referred to as ' his holiness @entity0 '			2
this means that after the election of the new pope next month there will be two men with the title ' holiness ' in the @entity33 at the same time			0
however , he still will be very present in the tiny @entity33 city - state , where his new home is right next door to the @entity98 and has a view of the dome of @entity101			0
in the absence of his red shoes , @entity0 has taken a liking to a pair of hand - crafted brown loafers made for him by artisans in @entity108 , @entity109 , and given to him during his 2012 visit			1
mr @entity32 also elaborated on the @entity112 meetings that will take place after the papacy becomes vacant - crucial gatherings in which cardinals will discuss the problems facing the church and set a date for the start of the conclave to elect @entity0 's successor			1
the first meeting is not expected until monday , since the official convocation to cardinals to come to @entity46 will only go out on friday - the first day of what 's known as the ' @entity127 , ' or the vacancy between papacies			0
in all , 115 cardinals under the age of 80 are expected in @entity46 for the conclave to vote on who should become the next pope			0
@entity0 yesterday gave the cardinals the go - ahead to move up the start date of the conclave , abolishing the traditional 15 - day waiting period			0
preparations : a priest in @entity142 this week ahead of the @entity0 's retirement mr @entity32 also further described @entity0 's final 48 hours as @entity0			1
on tuesday , he was packing , arranging for documents to be sent to the various archives at the @entity33 and separating out the personal papers he will take with him into retirement			0
on wednesday , @entity0 will hold his final public general audience in @entity142 - an event that has already seen 50,000 ticket requests			0
on thursday , the @entity0 meets with his cardinals in the morning and then flies by helicopter at 5pm to @entity153 , the papal residence south of @entity46			0
he will greet parishioners there from the palazzo 's loggia - his final public act as pope			0
at 8pm , the exact time at which his retirement becomes official , the @entity160 standing outside the doors of the palazzo at @entity153 will go off duty , their service protecting the head of the @entity169 now finished .			0

@entity0 will be known as ' his holiness ' and will continue to wear white robes
but he has to give up red leather shoes and will adopt brown loafers
