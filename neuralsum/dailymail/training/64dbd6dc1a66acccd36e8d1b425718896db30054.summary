zoo chiefs decided to send the 2013 calendars out because many had already been collected by supporters before @entity10 died , the @entity17 said			1
deadly hunters : zoo chiefs decided to release the calendars despite the tragic death zoo president @entity33 said scrapping the calendars , which were printed months ago , was considered			1
' we wrestled with that one quite a bit , ' she told the @entity17			0
' we had the calendars available before the accident occurred			0

' she added that the thoughts and prayers of zoo staff was with the family			2
the calendar , titled @entity50 , features the dogs in march and has four photographs of them with accompanying text			1
officials said they would quarantine the animals for a month			1
zoo president and ceo @entity33 said staff wrestled with the idea of releasing the calendar , but decided to go ahead as many copies had already made their way into the hands of zoo patrons scene : the overlook platform where the boy fell into the exhibit that was home to a pack of @entity8 painted dogs is seen through a window from another observation area at the @entity3 and @entity3 where : this is the overlook platform where two - year - old @entity10 fell into the dog enclosure			1

desperate rescue attempts by zookeepers and armed police officers could not deter the 11 aggressive beasts as they savagely attacked the two - year - old			1
@entity33 said there is a net below the rail , but the boy bounced off it and into the enclosure			0
she said the animals attacked the child so quickly that by the time a veterinarian and other zoo staffers arrived seconds later , they determined it would have been futile to try to rescue the child			1
authorities said that zoo staff and then police responded ' within minutes ' but visitors described that time as being filled with screams for help			2
zookeepers called off some of the dogs , and seven of them immediately went to a back building			1
the @entity8 wild dog is an endangered species which typically roams the open plains and sparse woodlands of @entity148			0
the dog 's latin name @entity149 means ' painted wolf ' because of the animal 's patchy colored coat of red , black , brown , white and yellow fur , each with their own unique pattern			0
these dogs are very social , and packs have been known to share food and to assist weak or ill members			2
in fact after a successful hunt , the dogs regurgitate meat for those that remained at the den. they hunt in packs of six to 20 and despite their small size they prey on large animals like antelopes and wildebeests			1
they kill the larger prey by disemboweling , a technique that is rapid but has caused this species to have a negative , ferocious reputation			0
they are often hunted and killed by farmers who fear for their domestic animals and are susceptible to diseases spread by domestic animals			2
its large teeth allow it to consume a lot of bone in the same way a hyena does and it has a bite force quotient - @entity194 , the strength of bite relative to the animal 's mass - measured at 142 , the highest of any carnivore , except for the @entity198			0
they are extremely aggressive and nearly 80 per cent of their hunts end in a kill - as opposed to a lion with a success rate of just 30 percent			1
there were once approximately 500,000 @entity8 wild dogs in 39 countries , and packs of 100 or more were not uncommon			2
now there are only about 3,000 - 5,500 in fewer than 25 countries three more eventually were drawn away from the child and one especially aggressive dog refused to back down and stop attacking the boy			2
it was shot dead by an officer			0
experts said the death is highly unusual			2
it is the first death in the zoo 's history			1
the dogs are currently in quarantine , but they will not be euthanised			2
@entity223 , a spokesman for the @entity224 , said no one he 's spoken to can recall any deaths of children at an accredited zoo over the last 40 years or more			2
@entity223 said the @entity3 successfully completed its five - year review in september , which means it meets or exceeds all safety standards			1
the so - called painted dogs are about as big as medium - sized domestic dogs , and 37 to 80 pounds , according to the zoo			1
they have large , rounded ears and dark brown circles around their eyes and are considered endangered			0
the attack happened in a 1.5 acre exhibit called the @entity239 that 's part of a larger open area where elephants , lions and other animals can be seen			2
visitors walk onto a deck that is glassed on the sides , but open in front where the roughly four - foot railing is located			0
in may , some of the dogs crawled under a fence and escaped into a part of the exhibit that 's usually closed			0
the zoo was on lockdown for about an hour as a precaution			0
@entity257 said there was nothing to prevent visitors to the painted dog exhibit from jumping into the exhibit area			0
he described the accident as ' horrific '			0
' unfortunately , the dogs were in pack mentality and not responding to zookeepers ' efforts to control them , ' the zoo said in a statement			1
emergency : @entity272 's entrance is seen after the young boy was killed after falling into the exhibit around noon lock - dock : the zoo immediately closed and patrons were hurried inside buildings during the attack deadly : the dogs , which are smaller than @entity281 , can be dangerous on their own but are deadly killers when hunting in packs uncertainty : a security guard closes the gate to the park , which was temporarily closed immediately after the tragedy in may , 200 patrons were rushed inside buildings and the zoo was put on lock - down when nine of the dogs sneaked out of the exhibit and found its way into a secondary holding pen			1
alone , the dogs , which weigh up to 80 pounds , can be formidable , but in packs they are vicious -- capable of hunting and killing prey many times their size			0
they have been known to kill wildebeest and zebras , though they usually pursue less dangerous prey			0
the dogs , which are endangered , are among the most deadly predators of the @entity309			0
their hunts end in a kill 80 per cent of the time			0
lions have a success rate of just 30 per cent .			0
