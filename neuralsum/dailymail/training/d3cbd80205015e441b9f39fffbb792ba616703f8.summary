by @entity0 for @entity1 wolves completed a top - class hat - trick as a stoppage - time own goal from @entity5 earned them a 1 - 0 win @entity7 win against @entity8			1
@entity5 deflected the ball into his own net following a speculative shot from @entity12			2
the goal ensured @entity2 have now beaten all three of the sides relegated from the @entity16 last season , having already secured 1 - 0 wins against @entity18 and @entity19			1
last - gasp : @entity2 players celebrate @entity5 's stoppage - time own goal the defeat capped a testing week in the worst possible way for @entity8 , who were in the headlines in the build - up to the game following the probe into former manager @entity30 and sporting director @entity31			1
@entity2 should have had the game wrapped up by half - time as they dominated without having a real cutting edge in front of goal			0
@entity8 , who were beaten for the first time this season , were a different proposition after the half - time introduction of striker @entity41 and he looked set to win the game for then in the 83rd minute only to be denied by a stunning save from @entity42			1
@entity2 winger @entity43 set the tone for the first period when he was denied a spectacular 13th - minute opener by the woodwork			0
top six : @entity5 's late intervention sees @entity2 jump into the fledgling @entity7 's play - off places after a spell of sustained @entity2 pressure , they forced two corners in quick succession and from the second @entity43 whipped in a curling centre			1
the ball flew over the outstretched hand of goalkeeper @entity57 and the @entity58 international was relieved to see it bounce to safety off the inside of his far post			2
wolves did carry the greater threat in the early exchanges and @entity8 were left to breathe a sigh of relief again when @entity69 's 20th - minute shot was deflected wide for a corner			2
the hosts were then caught out from their own corner with @entity73 launching a one - man counter-attack that saw him race the full length of the field before pulling his shot across the face of @entity42 's goal			0
it was a rare moment of menace for @entity8 , who were struggling to keep the three - pronged @entity2 attack of @entity69 , @entity43 and @entity84 in check			0
committed : the home side 's @entity86 is challenged by @entity88 of @entity8 @entity91 van @entity89 should really have made @entity2 ' pressure pay off on the half - hour when he was picked out at the far post by a cross from left - back @entity86 only to fail to hit the target with his close - range header			1
wolves : @entity42 ; @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity86 ; @entity102 , @entity12 , van @entity89 ( @entity103 87 ) , @entity104 ( @entity105 66 ) ; @entity106 , @entity84 substitutes not used : @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity112 - @entity111 scorer : @entity5 own goal 90 booked : @entity102 , @entity12 @entity8 : @entity57 ; @entity88 , @entity5 , @entity115 , @entity116 ; @entity117 ( @entity118 66 ) , @entity119 ( @entity120 75 ) , @entity121 , @entity122 ; @entity73 , @entity123 ( @entity41 46 ) substitutes not used : @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 booked : @entity121 , @entity88 referee : @entity129 ( @entity130 ) attendance : 21,221 @entity69 then tested @entity57 from long range and right - back @entity99 fired into the side - netting as @entity8 's goal continued to lead a charmed life			1
@entity2 ' failure to take advantage of their dominance should really have been punished on the stroke of half - time as @entity8 finally managed to muster a chance of their own			0
a corner from @entity117 found its way to @entity115 at the far post but he could not turn the ball home from two yards			0
@entity8 boss @entity149 needed to do something to shake up his team and he turned to the powerful presence of @entity41 at half - time , sending him on in place of @entity123			0
@entity41 certainly proved a handful for @entity2 ' central defenders @entity101 and @entity100 and it was no surprise that @entity8 started to carry more of a threat going forward with @entity159 seeing his 20 - yard drive in the 55th - minute turned around the post by @entity42			0
heads you win : @entity8 winger @entity117 ( left ) goes up for a header with @entity2 ' @entity86 tackle : @entity2 ' @entity84 is challenged by @entity8 skipper @entity5 , who would go on to score a late own goal substitute @entity167 then had a 76th - minute shot saved by @entity42 , with @entity8 's players appealing strongly for a penalty after the ball appeared to deflect off the arm of @entity101			1
@entity159 then picked out @entity41 who was just six yards from goal but his volley was beaten away by @entity42 before @entity5 's unfortunate intervention earned @entity2 victory in a dramatic finale .			2

@entity8 captain @entity5 slices a @entity12 cross into his own net
home side had dominated but struggled to test @entity8 goalkeeper @entity57 before late own goal
