dogs and wolves evolved from a common ancestor between 11,000 and 34,000 years ago , according to new research			1
@entity5 scientists said that part of the genetic overlap observed between some modern dogs and wolves is the result of interbreeding after dog domestication and not a direct line of descent from one group of wolves			1
they believe their research reflects a more complicated history than the popular story that early farmers adopted a few docile , friendly wolves that later became our modern canine companions			1
dogs and wolves evolved from a common ancestor between 11,000 and 34,000 years ago but modern canines are more closely related to each other than to wolves , according to new research instead , the earliest dogs may have first lived among hunter - gatherer societies and adapted to agricultural life later , according to the study which is published in the journal @entity33			1
researchers from the @entity35 said that dogs are more closely related to each other than to wolves , regardless of geographic origin as they do not descend from a single line of wolves			1
@entity41 , associate professor in the @entity42 at the university , who is also the study ’s senior author , said : ‘ dog domestication is more complex than we originally thought			1
‘ in this analysis we did n't see clear evidence in favour of a multi-regional model , or a single origin from one of the living wolves that we sampled			0
‘ it makes the field of dog domestication very intriguing going forward , ’ he added			1
this graphic shows how genetic relationships evolved over time , based on three dogs , three wolves and a jackal the scientists sequenced the genome of three grey wolves from different geographic areas , as well as produced genomes for two dog breeds : a basenji ( pictured ) , which originates in @entity68 and a dingo from @entity70 , as both areas that have been historically isolated from modern wolf populations the team of scientists sequenced the genomes of three grey wolves – one of which was from @entity79 , one from @entity80 and another from @entity81 – to represent the three regions where dogs are believed to have originated			1
they produced genomes for two dog breeds - a basenji , which originates in @entity68 and a dingo from @entity70 - as both areas that have been historically isolated from modern wolf populations			2
the researchers also sequenced the genome of a golden jackal to serve as an ‘ outgroup ’ representing earlier genetic divergence			2
analysis of basenji , dingo and boxer genomes showed that the dog breeds were most closely related to each other			0
a dingo is pictured their analysis of the basenji and dingo genomes , plus a previously published boxer genome from @entity106 , showed that the dog breeds were most closely related to each other			0
likewise , the three wolves from each geographic area were more closely related to each other than any of the dogs			2
dr @entity41 said the findings of the study tell a different story than he and his colleagues anticipated			0
instead of all three dogs being closely related to one of the wolf lineages , or each dog being related to its closest geographic counterpart , they seem to have descended from an older , wolf - like ancestor common to both species			2
‘ one possibility is there may have been other wolf lineages that these dogs diverged from that then went extinct , ' dr @entity41 said			0
‘ so now when you ask which wolves are dogs most closely related to , it 's none of these three because these are wolves that diverged in the recent past			0
‘ it 's something more ancient that is n't well represented by today 's wolves , ’ he added			0
the study shows how complex the early domestication of wolves was and dr @entity41 said his team is trying to collect every scrap of evidence to reconstruct what happened in the past			1
‘ we use genetics to reconstruct the history of population sizes , relationships among populations and the gene flow that occurred			0
so now we have a much more detailed picture than existed before , and it 's a somewhat surprising picture , ’ he said			0
dogs were man ’s best friend as far back as the @entity157 and dogs and humans first bonded between 19,000 and 30,000 years ago , according to a study published in november			0
that was when wolves , ancestors of domestic dogs living today , were first tamed by ancient hunter gatherers , according to genetic evidence			1
early tamed wolves may have been trained as hunting dogs or even protected their human masters from predators			0
the findings challenge a previous theory that dog domestication happened some 15,000 years ago in eastern @entity174 , after the introduction of agriculture			1
in reality , the history of the bond between dog and man appears to go back much further , to a time when fur - clad humans were living in caves and hunting woolly mammoths			0
scientists used dna analysis to establish what populations of wolves were most related to living dogs .			2

@entity5 scientists believe the genetic overlap observed between some modern dogs and wolves is the result of interbreeding after dog domestication
@entity35 researchers said their study reflects a more complicated history of how canines came to be domesticated
