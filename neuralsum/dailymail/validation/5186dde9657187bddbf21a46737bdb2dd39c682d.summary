up to 80 per cent of women fake orgasms , according to recent research - and that might not be a bad thing			1
turns out some women fake it in order to make it a real orgasm happen			1
researchers surveyed 481 heterosexual females , all sexually active but not in serious relationships			1
the women gave four main reasons for faking orgasm			1
the most common reason was ‘ altruistic deceit ’ - to protect the man ’s feelings			2
second , fear and insecurity			2
wanting the sex to be a positive experience , rather than a negative one			2
fourth , was faking it to end the sex session			0
no surprises there ( though it ’s usually further up the list ! ) the most interesting reason came third on the list			0
‘ elevated arousal ’ - faking orgasm to make yourself feel more turned on			0
the women said by pretending to orgasm , they were attempting to increase their arousal levels			1
and do you know what ? i believe them			0
the ‘ fake it till you make it ’ theory is based on the assumption that if you act out the thing you want to happen , sometimes it will			2
psychologists use the same technique on depressed patients : the act of smiling triggers hormones which make us feel happier so a forced smile eventually turns into a real one			0
sexpert @entity17 says for some women pretending to climax could actually bring on the real thing the women in the study said if they pretended to orgasm , their partner got more excited , which got them more excited			1
by reenacting the lead - up to a real orgasm - breathing faster , making noise , moving your hips , tensing your muscles - you might just push yourself over the threshold to the point where orgasm becomes involuntary			0
but there are two crucial points that need to be made here			0
first up , the study was based on women who were n’t in relationships so the overall percentage of ‘ fakers ’ ( 80 per cent ) is hopefully lower in couples who are more comfortable with each other			1
it ’s also best not to use the ‘ fake it to make it ’ technique at the beginning of relationships ( unless you explain that ’s what you ’re doing , which is unlikely )			1
how is your partner ever going to learn to give you a real orgasm if they think they ’re doing it already ? the absolute worst time to fake an orgasm is at the start of a relationship , which is , of course , when most women ( and some men ) do it			1
keep on doing it and you ’ve set up a pattern of behaviour that ’s based on deception and dissatisfaction			0
he ’ll keep on using the same ineffectual techniques because he thinks he ’s turning you on ; you ’ll remain frustrated and irritable every time you have sex			0
having the courage to say “ actually , that does nothing for me , ” is n’t easy but you really must			0
communication is the key to good sex - and faking orgasm ( for reasons that are n’t so helpful ) is n’t necessary if admitting to not having one is n’t a problem ! read more about love and relationships at @entity131			2

sexpert examines research that finds 80 *%* of women fake orgasms
but study *focused* on women not in relationships
@entity17 *advises* that women with new partners should be honest
