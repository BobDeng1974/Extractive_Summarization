the court heard that he was previously jailed for assault in 2005 and also has previous convictions for drugs offences and public order offences			1
sentencing the 30 - year - old , judge @entity52 , told him : ' i am going to sentence you under the name of @entity1 although i suspect that is not actually your true name , in the sense that it is not the name that appears on your passport			1
' what i have to deal with you for is clear enough			0
' you knew perfectly well that you were not welcome in the @entity6			2
' you knew that because you tried before and you had not got in , and you knew the reason for that - because , rightly or wrongly , the @entity6 authorities do not welcome people in their country who have convictions of the kind that you have			1
unwelcome : @entity1 , who uses a number of aliases , was banned from the @entity6 for previous convictions ' with that full knowledge , you equipped yourself with a passport			1
i am told that it was given you by way of a loan from your friend @entity17 , to which you bore , i am told , some resemblance			0
' and by use of that passport you did what you could to get into the @entity6			1
' but you did not get in because they took your fingerprints and they worked out that you were not who you claimed to be			0
' i am told that , by whatever means , you slipped away from the @entity6 authorities , got into the country and then very rapidly - and understandably so - got out of it			2
' he said @entity1 had used his own passport to get out of the @entity6 , adding : ' you did so , i am quite sure , in order to avoid the consequences that would have fallen upon you had you been caught by the authorities in @entity6			1
' the judge went on : ' what you did went absolutely to the heart of the immigration controls that the @entity6 are entitled to have			2
extremist : @entity1 , seen here at an @entity2 demonstration , bears a resemblance to the man who lent him the passport , the court heard ' had it been known in this country that you were proposing to leave under a false passport , you would not have been accepted on to the plane and you would not have been permitted to leave this country on a false passport			1
' it 's not in any sense trivial			0
' he sentenced @entity1 to 10 months in prison , minus the days he has already served in custody			0

opening the case , mr @entity119 told the court : ' on monday september 10 2012 , the defendant travelled from @entity20 to @entity21 on a @entity19 flight , travelling using a passport in the name of @entity17 , believed to be a colleague of the defendant			0
' he checked in using a self check - in kiosk at @entity20 before proceeding to the baggage drop area			0
' the defendant then proceeded through security and boarded the flight			0
' he added : ' upon arrival in @entity21 , he was the subject of immigration checks as with everybody else			0
' he identified himself to the @entity145 officials as @entity146			0
' @entity1 passed through @entity20 on the passport without incident , but suspicions were raised at @entity21 's @entity36 photographs and fingerprints were taken , and @entity6 customs officials realised that @entity1 was not who he said he was			1
' he had been previously refused entry to the @entity6 on the grounds of his previous convictions and he was directed to attend a secondary investigation but he did not report for that , ' the prosecutor said			1
' he left the immigration and customs area , entered the @entity6 unlawfully and then he returned to @entity20 , via @entity162 , and used his passport in the name of @entity41 , which is a name he does go by			2
' the court heard that although @entity1 has only one passport , which is in that name , he uses aliases			2
@entity6 officials produced fingerprints and photographs proving that @entity1 was not mr @entity17 , the court heard , and there was also @entity175 from @entity36 showing him arriving			1
@entity1 was arrested in october and did not reply to questions in interview			0
in mitigation , his defence barrister , @entity178 , told the court that @entity1 had not stolen the passport , and had only used it for a day			2
authorities at @entity36 realised @entity1 was not the person in the passport			2
file picture he told the court his client had pleaded guilty straightaway , demonstrating ' a certain amount of courage '			1
' firstly , this passport was not stolen , it was lent by a friend for whatever purpose , ' he told the court			0
' secondly , he was only using the passport , it transpires , for a day and a half			0
in fact he only spent one evening in the @entity6			0
" i think the intention was simply to avoid a necessity for a visa into the @entity6			0
' upon realising that in actual fact it was not going to assist matters , on realising he had committed an offence , he used his own passport to come back			0
' it is not , i would suggest , the most aggravating of cases of this kind			0
' the @entity2 has held many demonstrations across the country since it was formed in @entity213 in march 2009 after @entity215 radicals disrupted a homecoming parade by the @entity217			0
