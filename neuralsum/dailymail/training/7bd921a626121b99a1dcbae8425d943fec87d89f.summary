by @entity0 two - year - old @entity1 squeezes her mother tight and begs her to tell @entity3 to stop his siren			1
sadly though , the deafening noise is out of her mum ’s control			0
it ’s 11pm and @entity1 is cowering with her parents and little sister in the stairwell of her apartment building in @entity13 , as @entity15 rockets fly overhead			1
the bellowing sirens wailing outside are the warning that @entity13 is under attack			1
‘ i realise now that having grown up in @entity20 and spent most of my adult years in @entity21 i ’d never experienced real fear before - not until i first heard that siren , ’ says 35 - year - old @entity23 , mum to @entity1 and 1 - year - old @entity25			1
‘ the worst part is knowing your children are in danger and being helpless to protect them			2
’ when the sirens start , @entity23 and the other residents of @entity13 have 90 seconds before the bombs reach them from @entity35			1
‘ all i can think about is getting my girls to as protected a place as possible , ' she says , which for @entity23 is the inner stairwell of her apartment block			1
' i feel total panic inside but i try to put on a calm face			0
i do n’t want them to sense my fear - at least that i can try to control , ’ she says			2
‘ once we had kids , living in @entity59 became unfeasible , so we looked to move on			2
we thought about moving back to the @entity60 but then @entity55 , who 's a lawyer in hi - tech , was offered a job in @entity63			1
' of course i had my reservations - i knew there was a fragile state of peace in @entity63 - but i loved the atmosphere , the climate and the vibrancy of @entity13 , so we decided to make the move			1
‘ within a week of being here in november 2012 , @entity15 fired rockets into @entity75 , a town in the @entity76			2
i was glad it had n’t made the news in the @entity60 because friends and family might have questioned our decision - and i did n’t want anything to ruin our new life			2
' we ’d started to make friends and i loved the laid back lifestyle			0
at the time , there had n’t been a rocket attack on @entity13 for 21 years and the general consensus amongst the @entity87 was that @entity13 was out of range , so i did n’t feel we were in danger			2
’ what @entity23 had n’t taken into account was that only 40 miles away from @entity13 , the @entity35 , given to @entity92 in 2005 , was now under @entity15 rule			1
‘ i remember watching the @entity87 withdraw from @entity35 on the @entity94 from my flat in @entity96 and thinking it was a step towards peace in the region			0
i never imagined in my wildest dreams how negatively that news snippet would end up impacting my life and that years later that strip of land would become a launch pad for firing rockets at me and my family			2
’ the trail of smoke from @entity35 rockets heading towards @entity23 's hometown of @entity13 so how does a @entity60 girl feel about the @entity87 government ’s retaliation ? ‘ what i realise living here is how targeted @entity63 tries to be with its response - they drop leaflets and phone ahead so civilians can evacuate before they strike terrorist targets			1
but by using their people as human shields and hiding rocket launchers and weapons in civilian houses and schools , the jihadist regime does n't make it easy to avoid fatalities			0
but there 's sadness here when there are fatalities on either side			2
no one wants blood shed			0
' the hardest part of the ordeal for @entity23 is dropping her girls at nursery each morning , not knowing what the day holds			2
' there are ten children in @entity1 ’s class but it takes them four minutes to get to the basement where the bomb shelter is , so they huddle in a corner of the classroom as far away from the windows as possible			1
‘ some parents have stopped taking their kids to nursery but we both work so we do n’t have that luxury			2
one morning last week , the day after the nursery in the @entity155 had been hit by a rocket , @entity1 noticed me getting teary as i kissed her goodbye			0
she said , ‘ do n’t worry mummy , you ’ll pick me up soon ’ , which is exactly what i usually say to her , but in reverse			0
i felt like my heart was going to burst			0
’ ‘ at nursery they ’ve told @entity1 that the siren is @entity3 playing a game , so i ’ve tried to keep up the pretense			0
but when she ’s snatched from her bed in the middle of the night and sees people screaming and running for shelter during the day , even a two - year old is wise enough to know something frightening is happening , ’ says @entity23			1
happier times : @entity180 with her three children ( from top left ) @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 before @entity13 was under attack when @entity23 and her family huddle on the stairwell they wait to hear ‘ the boom ’			1
‘ the noise scares the girls but it signals relief , ’ she says			0
the boom she ’s referring to is the reverberation of the rockets being intercepted by the @entity197 – new @entity87 anti-missile technology			0
since the attacks began two weeks ago , the @entity197 has managed to destroy the vast majority of the 1,600 @entity15 rockets launched on @entity63 , preventing them from causing the desired death and devastation on the ground			1
' without the @entity15 would have killed tens of thousands of @entity87 civilians dead by now , ' says @entity23			1
so will @entity23 give up on her dream lifestyle and move back home ? ‘ leaving two jobs , nurseries and friends is n’t so straight forward , ’ she says			2
‘ and in some ways i feel more at home here than ever			0
they say the worst of times bring out the best in human nature – and in my experience that ’s certainly been true			0
‘ the other day when a siren went off i got stuck in the door of the supermarket with my double buggy and with only a few seconds left people were putting themselves in danger to help me get the girls out			0
relative strangers have offered for us to move into their house so that we can be nearer to a proper bomb shelter at night			1
and if you walk down the street , front doors are left unlocked so passers by can shelter in the event of a missile attack			0
@entity180 's three children ( left to right ) @entity183 , @entity185 and @entity184 , on arrival in @entity63 , unaware of the trauma that lay ahead ‘ it would also be hard to leave the friends we ’ve lived through this trauma with because only they really understand what we ’ve been through , ' @entity23 adds			1
once such friend is fellow expat @entity248 from @entity21			1
the mum - of - three left the @entity60 for @entity250 eight years ago then relocated to @entity63 in 2012			1
‘ my brother moved to @entity63 from @entity21 and made a great life for himself here , so we decided to try it out instead of going back to @entity21 , ’ says @entity180 , mum to @entity183 , 10 , @entity184 , 4 and @entity185 , who turned three last week			1
‘ the first night the sirens went off i was out at friends and had left a babysitter at home with the kids			0
no one was expecting it			0
’ ‘ i ’d just stepped out the door of their block and instead of going back in i started running to my car to get home to my kids , which was obviously impossible within 90 seconds			1
but in the panic that ’s all i could think to do			0
i was throwing up as i ran and was retching the whole way home			0
‘ i drove along the deserted streets , knowing that if these rockets were n’t intercepted i ’d be finished			0
i did n’t even know what a bomb sounded like so when i heard a boom overhead i did n't know if it was the noise of the rocket about to land , an explosion or an interception			0
' i just kept going as fast as i could until i was back through the door with my children			0
they were asleep when i came in and the babysitter helped me carry them onto the floor of the bomb shelter in the basement			1
‘ since then we ’ve been sleeping in shelter every night			2
i ca n’t risk getting three kids to safety in 90 seconds on my own , ' she says , but adds she feels lucky she 's not in @entity63 where they only have 15			1
' the children have obviously been very traumatised and confused , ' says @entity180 , so after ten days of shelling , she and six other mums decided to brave an outing to a nearby swimming pool with their kids			0
‘ suddenly the sirens went off and the kids in the pool started panicking and scrambling to get out , ' she says			0
' parents were screaming , desperate to find their children , and kids were crying in a frenzy to get inside before the bombs were overhead			2
it was like a scene out of a disaster movie , ’ she says			1
' i never imagined this is where my journey would end up			0
' let 's hope this disaster movie soon has a peaceful ending			1

@entity23 , 35 , from @entity20 moved to @entity56 before relocating to @entity63 for her *husband* 's work
