@entity0 the great : @entity3 scores puts @entity4 1 - 0 up against rivals @entity5 earlier this season - on sunday the two side 's are battling for the final @entity8 spot next frame : @entity5 keeper @entity10 turns to see @entity3 's shot fly into the net			1
@entity4 won the derby in march 2 - 1 @entity14 : @entity16 's @entity15 will lead this week 's @entity17 @entity19 's series of @entity20 continues with @entity15 leading the discussion ahead of the final weekend of @entity23 fixtures			1
@entity15 , @entity16 's athletics correspondent and @entity25 football reporter , is ideally placed to lift the lid on the race for the @entity8			1
and most mouth - wateringly , the prospect of an unprecedented play - off for third place and automatic qualification for @entity33 's premier competition			2
@entity19 has revealed that @entity5 and @entity35 face the prospect of ending the season level on points and goal difference - meaning there would be a one - off play - off to decide who finishes third in the @entity23			1
@entity5 's 4 - 1 win over @entity44 at the @entity45 on tuesday night means that @entity47 's side moved on to 70 points and goal difference of 34 with goals scored at 71 for the season			1
on sunday the @entity52 travel to @entity53 , who have nothing to play for			0
join the debate , join our hangout today live at @entity59 from 1pm ... this means that if @entity35 were to draw with @entity61 at @entity62 on the final day and @entity5 beat @entity53 by one goal and also concede at least one - so 2 - 1 , 3 - 2 , 4 - 3 etc - then they will be all square			1
with third place in the @entity23 qualifying for the group stages of the @entity8 rather than having to go through a qualifier , it means finishing third is a big advantage			0
@entity16 understands that the @entity23 are preparing for the possibility of a play - off , should it come to that			0
the possibility of an end of season play - off has been planned for in the past , back in the 1995 - 96 season when @entity78 and @entity53 were fighting it out for the title			2
despite being neck and neck for much of the run - in , @entity78 won the league without the need for a play - off			0
it is understood that if there is a play - off then it would be as soon after the end of season as possible and while there is no location set for an eventual play - off , it is almost certain to be in @entity25			2
the problem for the @entity23 would be when to play such a match - @entity35 have an end - of - season tour to the @entity99 to play friendlies against @entity101 next week , and then there are @entity104 friendlies on may 29 against the @entity105 and then in @entity106 on june 2			1
but it is understood the @entity23 would want it to be played as soon as possible as neither club would want the season to stretch into june but the play - off regulation is part of @entity23 rules			0
@entity4 can still gatecrash the @entity8 party and pip @entity5 to fourth			1
@entity15 has watched and reported on @entity4 many times this season			2
is fifth failure for @entity116 ? ask @entity15			0
