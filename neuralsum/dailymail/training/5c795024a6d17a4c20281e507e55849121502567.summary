and it predicted the problem would ‘ get worse ’ as councils continued to black out lights			1
road safety campaigners have long warned of the dangers of unlit streets as councils continue to dim or turn off their lights to make savings and meet climate change targets			1
the @entity5 said some town halls were failing to ‘ recognise the dangers ’			2
in one of the most alarming cases , a coroner blasted a council over its trial of switching off street lights following the death of a 76 - year - old widow			2
@entity38 was hit by a car on the @entity40 between @entity41 and @entity42 , @entity43 , in the early evening of january 21 , 2009			0

police said street lighting , which had been turned off along the 40mph stretch of road by @entity64 as part of a cost - cutting exercise , could have saved his life			0
@entity5 president @entity68 said : ‘ there is growing evidence that cost savings from councils turning off street lights are being paid for with lives			1
inquests point to a particular danger on roads with speed limits of 40mph or higher			0
‘ for that reason , drivers have no choice but to slow down and switch to full beam on faster town roads where late - night street lighting used to make roads and streets safer places to travel			2
‘ many of these inquests clear the drivers of blame , which means these tragic deaths are accidents waiting to happen			0
with many more councils switching off their street lights for at least part of the night , the tragedy will just get worse			1
the @entity5 said drivers had little or no chance of avoiding collisions on unlit streets and predicted problem would ' get worse ' as council cut back on street lights to save money ‘ at what point will the government take action or help councils to finance the switch to energy - saving street lights : 10 , 15 , 20 inquests later ? ’ the @entity5 investigation followed research in april which showed there were fewer accident reductions between 2007 and 2012 on 40mph roads where street lights had been switched off			1
last year , a survey found that a third of councils have switched off street lights to save money , while nearly half are making streets darker by dimming bulbs			1
the @entity126 found that of 71 local authorities which responded , 23 switched off street lights - typically between midnight and 5am - and 32 dimmed lights			1
councils were mainly motivated by a desire to save energy and money , with the reduction of light pollution ‘ an additional benefit ’			0
@entity137 council is running a dimming scheme designed to save £ 400,000 a year and reduce power consumption by 25 per cent			0
@entity140 expects to save £ 1million per year by introducing a part - night lighting scheme			0
a @entity143 spokesman said : ‘ councils always consider the safety implications before turning off street lights , monitor subsequent safety statistics and act if presented with evidence of a public safety risk			2
